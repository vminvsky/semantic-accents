The country inherited a significant portion of the Soviet nuclear arsenal, which raised concerns about its potential use and proliferation. This article provides an overview of Ukraine's nuclear capabilities, international agreements, and the debate surrounding renuclearization.\n\n# Ukrainian Nuclear Arsenal after Dissolution of the Soviet Union\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ukraine held about one-third of the Soviet nuclear arsenal. This included 130 UR-100N/RS-18 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) with six warheads each, 46 RT-23 Molodets ICBMs with ten warheads apiece, as well as 33 heavy bombers. The total number of warheads remaining on Ukrainian territory was approximately 1,700. This made Ukraine one of the largest nuclear powers in the world at the time.\n\nThe Soviet nuclear arsenal was a complex system, with various types of delivery systems and warheads. The UR-100N/RS-18 missiles were equipped with multiple independent reentry vehicles (MIRVs), allowing them to carry multiple warheads. The RT-23 Molodets ICBMs were designed to carry a large number of warheads, with some variants capable of carrying up to 10 warheads. The heavy bombers, such as the Tupolev Tu-160, were equipped with air-launched cruise missiles and free-fall bombs.\n\nThe Ukrainian government inherited not only the nuclear arsenal but also the infrastructure and personnel necessary to maintain and operate it. This included nuclear research and development facilities, production facilities, and a network of airfields and missile launch sites. However, the Ukrainian military lacked the necessary resources and expertise to maintain the nuclear arsenal, and the country's economy was struggling to recover from the effects of the Soviet collapse.\n\n# Budapest Memorandum\n\nIn response to Ukraine's nuclear inheritance, the international community came together to provide assurances and guarantees to the country. The Budapest Memorandum, signed on December 5, 1994, was a key document that established Ukraine as a non-nuclear-weapon state. The memorandum was signed by Ukraine, the United States, Russia, and the United Kingdom, and it provided a framework for the disarmament and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in Ukraine.\n\nThe Budapest Memorandum committed Ukraine to the following:\n\n* Recognizing its sovereignty and territorial integrity\n* Renouncing nuclear weapons and agreeing to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)\n* Committing to the peaceful use of nuclear energy\n* Agreeing to the removal of nuclear weapons and delivery systems from its territory\n* Recognizing the inalienable right of Ukraine to restore its territorial integrity by peaceful means\n\nThe memorandum also committed the signatory countries to provide Ukraine with security guarantees, including:\n\n* Recognizing Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity\n* Committing to the peaceful resolution of disputes\n* Agreeing to consult with Ukraine in the event of a threat to its security\n* Referring any aggression against Ukraine to the UN Security Council\n\nThe Budapest Memorandum was a significant achievement in the history of international relations, as it established a new model for disarmament and non-proliferation. However, the agreement has faced challenges and criticisms over the years, particularly with regard to Russia's behavior towards Ukraine.\n\n# France and China's Commitments\n\nWhile the Budapest Memorandum provided Ukraine with important assurances and guarantees, France and China also provided the country with separate commitments. However, these commitments differed from those outlined in the Budapest Memorandum.\n\nFrance's commitment to Ukraine was contained in a letter signed by President François Mitterrand on January 13, 1995. The letter committed France to:\n\n* Recognizing Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity\n* Committing to the peaceful resolution of disputes\n* Agreeing to consult with Ukraine in the event of a threat to its security\n\nHowever, France's commitment did not include the promises laid out in paragraphs 4 and 6 of the Budapest Memorandum, to refer any aggression to the UN Security Council or to consult in the event of a question regarding the commitments.\n\nChina's commitment to Ukraine was contained in a joint declaration signed by President Jiang Zemin and President Leonid Kuchma on January 21, 1996. The declaration committed China to:\n\n* Recognizing Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity\n* Committing to the peaceful resolution of disputes\n* Agreeing to consult with Ukraine in the event of a threat to its security\n\nHowever, China's commitment did not include the promises laid out in paragraphs 4 and 6 of the Budapest Memorandum.\n\n# Russian Invasion and Nuclear Weapons\n\nIn 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, which was widely condemned by the international community. The annexation raised concerns about the Russian military's presence in Ukraine, particularly with regard to nuclear-capable weapons.\n\nAfter the annexation, the Russian Federation re-deployed nuclear-capable weapons to the Crimean peninsula, including S-300 antiaircraft missiles, Tu-22M3 Backfire bombers, and Iskander-M ballistic missiles. This raised concerns about the potential use of nuclear weapons in the conflict.\n\nIn 2020, a Ukrainian NSDC official stated that Russia had done work on the Soviet nuclear-weapons storage facility Feodosiia-13 in Krasnokamianka (Kyzyltash) and had added new tunnels to a nuclear submarine base at Balaklava.\n\n# Debates about Ukrainian Renuclearization\n\nThe debate about Ukrainian renuclearization has been ongoing for many years, with some arguing that Ukraine should reacquire nuclear weapons to ensure its security. However, others argue that this would be a destabilizing factor in the region and could lead to a new arms race.\n\nIn 1993, international relations theorist and University of Chicago professor John Mearsheimer predicted that a Ukraine without a nuclear deterrent was likely to be subjected to aggression by Russia. This argument has been repeated by some in the Ukrainian government and military, who argue that nuclear weapons are necessary to ensure the country's security.\n\nHowever, others argue that renuclearization would be a bad idea, citing the risks of nuclear proliferation and the potential for nuclear accidents or terrorism. They also point out that Ukraine has already made significant progress in demilitarizing and joining international organizations, and that renuclearization would undermine these efforts.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate about nuclear weapons and Ukraine is complex and multifaceted. While some argue that Ukraine should reacquire nuclear weapons to ensure its security, others argue that this would be a destabilizing factor in the region and could lead to a new arms race. Ultimately, the decision to renuclearize or remain a non-nuclear-weapon state is a complex one that requires careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Nuclear_weapons_and_Ukraine\" following this outline:\n\n\nUkrainian nuclear arsenal after dissolution of the Soviet Union\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ukraine held about one-third of the Soviet nuclear arsenal, the third largest in the world at the time, as well as significant means of its design and production [7] 130 UR-100N/RS-18 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) with six warheads each, 46 RT-23 Molodets ICBMs with ten warheads apiece, as well as 33 heavy bombers, totalling approximately 1,700 warheads remained on Ukrainian territory [8] [9] [10]\n\n\nBudapest Memorandum\nThe Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine in 1990 stated that Ukraine would not accept, acquire, or produce nuclear weapons, and its government declared on 24 October 1991 that Ukraine would be a non-nuclear-weapon state [12]\n\n\nFrance and China's commitments\nFrance and China also provided Ukraine with assurances similar to the Budapest Memorandum, but with some significant differences For instance, France's pledge does not contain the promises laid out in paragraphs 4 and 6 above, to refer any aggression to the UN Security Council, nor to consult in the event of a question regarding the commitments [14]\n\n\nRussian invasion and nuclear weapons\nRussian forces withdrew nuclear weapons and delivery systems from the Crimean peninsula after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, in the mid-1990s, with the exception of some nuclear-capable ships and submarines of the Black Sea Fleet stationed in accordance with agreements with Ukraine [16] After annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014, which the UN General Assembly rejected as invalid, [17] the Government of Ukraine in 2014 reaffirmed its 1994 decision to accede to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear-weapon state [18] Meanwhile, the Russian Federation again re-deployed nuclear-capable weapons to the peninsula, including S-300 antiaircraft missiles, and later Tu-22M3 Backfire bombers and Iskander-M ballistic missiles [16] [19] [20] In 2020, a Ukrainian NSDC official stated that Russia had done work on Soviet nuclear-weapons storage facility Feodosiia-13 in Krasnokamianka (Kyzyltash), and had added new tunnels to a nuclear submarine base at Balaklava [21]\n\n\nDebates about Ukrainian renuclearization\nIn 1993, international relations theorist and University of Chicago professor John Mearsheimer predicted that a Ukraine without a nuclear deterrent was likely to be subjected to aggression by Russia [28]\n\n\nReference list\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is a member of the Indian National Congress and has been a prominent figure in Punjab politics for over two decades.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n------------------------\n\nCharanjit Singh Channi was born in the village of Makrauna Kalan, Punjab. He belongs to the Sikh community and has been an active participant in various social and political activities throughout his life. Channi studied law at Panjab University and obtained a Master's degree in Business Administration (MBA) from Punjab Technical University (PTU) Jalandhar. He was awarded a PhD in Political Science from Panjab University in 2020, making him a PhD holder in the field.\n\nEarly Political Career\n----------------------\n\nChanni started his political career as a municipal councillor from a ward in Kharar and was elected as the president of the Kharar municipal council in 2002. This marked the beginning of his journey in Punjab politics, and he has since been an active participant in various local and state-level elections.\n\nLeader of Opposition\n-------------------\n\nIn 2015, Channi was elected as the leader of opposition in the Punjab Legislative Assembly, a position that he held until 2016. During his tenure as leader of opposition, Channi was vocal about various issues affecting the state, including the need for improved infrastructure, better healthcare services, and greater economic development.\n\nCabinet Minister\n----------------\n\nIn 2017, Channi was appointed as the Minister of Technical Education and Training in the Second Amarinder Singh ministry. As a cabinet minister, Channi was responsible for implementing various policies and programs aimed at improving the education sector in Punjab.\n\nChief Minister of Punjab\n-----------------------\n\nIn September 2021, Channi succeeded Captain Amarinder Singh as the Chief Minister of Punjab, following the latter's resignation. Channi's appointment as Chief Minister marked a significant milestone in Punjab politics, as he became the first Dalit Sikh to hold the position. His appointment was seen as a strategic move by the Congress party to appeal to the large Dalit population in Punjab.\n\n5 January 2022 Episode\n----------------------\n\nOn 5 January 2022, a controversy erupted when Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cavalcade was stranded for 15-20 minutes on a flyover in Firozpur district due to protesting farmers blocking the Moga-Firozpur highway.

Channi, however, denied any security lapse and stated that he would recite the Mahāmrityunjaya Mantra for Prime Minister Modi's safety.\n\n2022 Punjab Legislative Assembly Election\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIn the run-up to the 2022 Punjab Legislative Assembly elections, Channi was appointed as the Chief Ministerial candidate of the Congress party. The official campaign was named \"Sada Channi, Sada CM\" (Our Channi, Our CM), and the campaign song \"Channi Karda Masle Hal\" was launched in February 2022. However, Channi's campaign was marred by controversy, and he ultimately lost the election to Labh Singh Ugoke from the Chamkaur Sahib constituency.\n\nElectoral Performance\n---------------------\n\n| Election Year | Constituency | Result |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2022 | Chamkaur Sahib | Lost to Labh Singh Ugoke |\n| 2022 | Bhadaur | Lost to Labh Singh Ugoke |\n\nPersonal Life and Image\n-------------------------\n\nChanni is married to Kamaljit Kaur and has two children.

named Payton, Jordan and himself the best three trash talkers in the league), [30] had legendary competitiveness, and as the 1997 NBA Preview magazine stated, \"Payton  [was] quick, and strong as an ox\", making him the kind of player who could frustrate Jordan defensively.\n\n\nDurability\nIn his 17-year career, Payton missed only 25 games, and at one point held the longest active streak for consecutive games played, with 356; the streak ended in January 2001 [35] The Sporting News noted in a 2000 article, \"Durability always has been one of Payton's strong suits He has missed only two

instead for it to remain in Seattle, where he enjoyed the majority of his career's success and popularity This seems likely as the SuperSonics' team name, colors, uniforms and trophies are remaining in Seattle for a possible future team to adopt upon arrival Despite no official acknowledgement from the Thunder, they have not issued the number 20 to any player since their relocation.\n\n\nNBA

the streak ended in January 2001 [35] The Sporting News noted in a 2000 article, \"Durability always has been one of Payton's strong suits He has missed only two games in 10 seasons and is generally counted on for nearly a full game's worth of nonstop motion, despite chronic back pain that requires extensive stretching and regular applications of heating packs.\" [25]\n\n\nCoaching career\nPayton was the head coach at Lincoln University in Oakland for three seasons before becoming the head coach of the nearby College of Alameda men's team in 2024 [36]\n\n\nOff the court\nPayton is the son of Al and Annie Payton He married Monique James on July 26, 1997 They divorced in 2012 They lived in Oakland and Las Vegas and have three children: Gary II, Julian, and Raquel [37] Gary II has played for the Milwaukee Bucks, Los Angeles Lakers, Washington Wizards, Portland Trail Blazers, and the Golden State Warriors, where he won the NBA Championship Payton also has another son named Gary Payton Jr with a different mother [38] His brother, Brandon, was also a professional basketball player during the 2000s [39]\n\n\nPersonal life\nPayton is the son of Al and Annie Payton He married Monique James on July 26, 1997 They divorced in 2012 They lived in Oakland and Las Vegas and have three children: Gary II, Julian, and Raquel [37] Gary II has played for the Milwaukee Bucks, Los Angeles Lakers, Washington Wizards, Portland Trail Blazers, and the Golden State Warriors, where he won the NBA Championship Payton also has another son named Gary Payton Jr with a different mother [38] His brother, Brandon, was also a professional basketball player during the 2000s [39]\n\n\nPost-NBA career\nDuring the 2008–09 season, Payton served as a studio analyst for NBA TV and as an occasional substitute analyst on The NBA on TNT He was replaced with Kevin McHale for the 2009–10 season In 2013, Payton was named an analyst for Fox Sports 1's Fox Sports Live [41] For the 2016 NFL season, Payton provided weekly picks for Sports Betting Dime [42]\n\n\nMovie and TV appearances\nPayton has appeared in Eddie (1996), Like Mike (2002), The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part (2019), and also performed a speaking role in the 1999 comedy film The Breaks He also appeared on The Jamie Foxx Show.\n\n\nCharity and community involvement\nPayton has made numerous well-regarded contributions of both time and money to the community [44] He set up The Gary Payton Foundation [45] in 1996 to provide safe places for recreational activity, and to help underprivileged youth in his hometown of Oakland stay in school He hosts an annual charity basketball game as part of his foundation Payton also gave back to the East Oakland Youth Development Center (EOYDC), a youth center that he attended in Oakland when he was growing up In 2001, Payton donated $100,000 to renovate EOYDC's gym – his first big grant in his hometown of Oakland [46] Payton and his wife, Monique, have been active in fundraising endeavors for HIV awareness, and Payton has lent many hours and provided tremendous financial support to the Boys & Girls Club of America and the Make-a-Wish Foundation [37] Payton has also donated Miami Heat tickets to underprivileged children For the Christmas of 2003 he took 10 families from the Ronald McDonald House in Los Angeles and let each of the over 40 children have a $100 shopping spree at FAO Schwarz For Christmas, 2005, he gave 60 children $100 Toys-R-Us shopping sprees as part of the Voices For Children program In 1999, he wrote an autobiographical children's book entitled Confidence Counts as part of the \"Positively for Kids\" series, illustrating the importance of confidence through events in his own life In July 1999, Payton was named to The Sporting News' \"Good Guys in Sports\" list [37] Payton hosted a radio show in early 1998 on Seattle's KUBE 93.3 station He played hip-hop including The Roots, Raekwon, Outkast, and Cam'ron He did it for charity during the NBA lockout [47] During the 2021 NHL Expansion Draft for the Seattle Kraken, he made an appearance alongside former teammate Shawn Kemp [48]\n\n\nSupport of Seattle basketball\nSince the Sonics' move to Oklahoma City, Payton has openly expressed his desire not to have his retired jersey number in Oklahoma City as part of that team's history He wishes instead for it to remain in Seattle, where he enjoyed the majority of his career's success and popularity This seems likely as the SuperSonics' team name, colors, uniforms and trophies are remaining in Seattle for a possible future team to adopt upon arrival Despite no official acknowledgement from the Thunder, they have not issued the number 20 to any player since their relocation.\n\n\nNBA career statistics\n\n\nRegular season\n\n\nPlayoffs\n\n\nAwards/accomplishments\n\n\nNBA highlights\n\n\nOther\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Black_Lives_Matter", "content": "\nStructure and organization\nThe phrase \"Black Lives Matter\" can refer to a Twitter hashtag, a slogan, a social movement, a political action committee, [22] or a loose confederation of groups advocating for racial justice As a movement, Black Lives Matter is grassroots and decentralized, and leaders have emphasized the importance of local organizing over national leadership [23] [24] The structure differs from previous black movements, like the Civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s Such differences have been the subject of scholarly literature [25] Activist DeRay McKesson has commented that the movement \"encompasses all who publicly declare that black lives matter and devote their time and energy accordingly.\" [26]\n\n\nDecentralization\nThe phrase \"Black Lives Matter\" can refer to a Twitter hashtag, a slogan, a social movement, a political action committee, [22] or a loose confederation of groups advocating for racial justice As a movement, Black Lives Matter is grassroots and decentralized, and leaders have emphasized the importance of local organizing over national leadership [23] [24] The structure differs from previous black movements, like the Civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s Such differences have been the subject of scholarly literature [25] Activist DeRay McKesson has commented that the movement \"encompasses all who publicly declare that black lives matter and devote their time and energy accordingly.\" [26]\n\n\nBroader movement\nConcurrently, a broader movement involving several other organizations and activists emerged under the banner of \"Black Lives Matter\", as well [33] [34] In 2015, Johnetta Elzie, DeRay Mckesson, Brittany Packnett, and Samuel Sinyangwe initiated Campaign Zero, aimed at promoting policy reforms to end police brutality The campaign released a ten-point plan for reforms to policing, with recommendations including: ending broken windows theory policing, increasing community oversight of police departments, and creating stricter guidelines for the use of force [35] The New York Times reporter, John Eligon, wrote that some activists expressed concerns that the campaign was overly focused on legislative remedies for police violence [36]\n\n\nMovement for Black Lives\nThe Movement for Black Lives (M4BL) is a coalition of more than 50 groups representing the interests of black communities across the United States [38] Members include the Black Lives Matter Network, the National Conference of Black Lawyers, and the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights [39] Endorsed by groups such as Color of Change, Race Forward, Brooklyn Movement Center, PolicyLink, Million Women March Cleveland, and ONE DC, [40] the coalition receives communications and tactical support from an organization named Blackbird [41]\n\n\nFunding\nPolitico reported in 2015 that the Democracy Alliance, a gathering of Democratic-Party donors, planned to meet with leaders of several groups who were endorsing the Black Lives Matter movement [56] According to Politico, Solidaire, the donor coalition focusing on \"movement building\" and led by Texas oil fortune heir Leah Hunt-Hendrix, a member of the Democracy Alliance, had donated more than $200,000 to the BLM movement by 2015 [56]\n\n\nStrategies and tactics\nBlack Lives Matter originally used various social media platforms—including hashtag activism—to reach thousands of people rapidly [60] Since then, Black Lives Matter has embraced a diversity of tactics [61] Black Lives Matter protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful; when violence does occur, it is often committed by counter-protesters [62] [63] [64] Despite this, opponents often try to portray the movement as violent [64] [65]\n\n\nInternet and social media\nIn 2014, the American Dialect Society chose #BlackLivesMatter as their word of the year [66] [67] Yes! Magazine picked #BlackLivesMatter as one of the twelve hashtags that changed the world in 2014 [68] From July 2013 through May 1, 2018, the hashtag \"#BlackLivesMatter\" had been tweeted over 30 million times, an average of 17,002 times per day [69] By June 10, 2020, it had been tweeted roughly 47.8 million times, [70] with the period of July 7–17, 2016 having the highest usage, at nearly 500,000 tweets a day [69] This period also saw an increase in tweets using the hashtags \"#BlueLivesMatter\" and \"#AllLivesMatter\" [69] On May 28, 2020, there were nearly 8.8 million tweets with the hashtag, and the average had increased to 3.7 million a day [70]\n\n\nDirect action\nBLM generally engages in direct action tactics that make people uncomfortable enough that they must address the issue [75] [76] BLM has been known to build power through protest and rallies [77] BLM has also staged die-ins and held one during the 2015 Twin Cities Marathon [78]\n\n\nMedia, music and other cultural impacts\nSince the beginning of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2013, with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter, [87] the movement has been depicted and documented in film, song, television, literature, and the visual arts A number of media outlets are providing material related to racial injustice and the Black Lives Matter movement Published books, novels, and TV shows have increased in popularity in 2020 [88] Songs, such as Michael Jackson's \"They Don't Care About Us\" and Kendrick Lamar's \"Alright\", have been widely used as a rallying call at demonstrations [89] [90]\n\n\nAllegations of use of excessive force by police\nAccording to a study from the Bureau of Justice Statistics from 2002 to 2011, among those who had contact with the police, \"blacks (2.8%) were more likely than whites (1.0%) and Hispanics (1.4%) to perceive the threat or use of nonfatal force was excessive.\" [98]\n\n\nDisproportionate policing of Black Lives Matter events\nBlack Lives Matter protesters are themselves sometimes subject to excessive policing of the kind against which they are demonstrating In May 2020, in addition to police, 43,350 military troops were deployed against Black Lives Matter protesters nationally [110] Military surveillance aircraft were deployed against subsequent Black Lives Matter protests [110] Observers, such as U.S President Joe Biden, have noted that violent far-right mobilizations, including the 2021 United States Capitol attack, attracted smaller and more passive police presences than peaceful Black Lives Matter protests [111] [112] [113] [114] [115] In November 2015, a police officer in Oregon was removed from street duty following a social media post in which he said he would have to \"babysit these fools\", in reference to a planned BLM event [116]\n\n\nTimeline of notable events and demonstrations in the United States\nIn 2014, Black Lives Matter demonstrated against the deaths of numerous African Americans by

May, spurred on by a rash of racially charged events including those above, over 450 major protests [235] [236] were held in cities and towns across the United States and three continents [237] The breaking point was due primarily to the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, [238] eventually charged with second-degree murder after a video circulated showing Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes while Floyd pleaded for his life, repeating: \"I can't breathe.\" [239] [240] Following protesters' demands for additional prosecutions, three other

Matter has varied consistently and considerably by race and political affiliation [401] [402] A majority of Americans disapproved of the movement through 2018, after which it started gaining wider support Black Lives Matter's popularity surged and reached its highest levels yet in the summer of 2020, when a Pew Research Center poll found that 60% of white, 77% of Hispanic, 75% of Asian and 86% of African-Americans either strongly supported or somewhat supported BLM [19] However, its popularity had declined considerably in September of the same year, when another Pew Research Center poll showed that its overall approval ratings among all American adults had gone down by 12 percentage points to 55%, and that 45% of whites, 66% of Hispanics and 69% of Asians now approved of it [403] Support remained widespread among black-American adults at 87% [403]\n\n\n\"All Lives Matter\"\nThe phrase \"All Lives Matter\" sprang up as a response to the Black Lives Matter movement, shortly

supports the All Lives Matter message, saying \"I stand by what I said that All Lives Matter and that we are human beings.\" [414] According to an August 2015 telephone poll, 78% of likely American voters said that the statement \"all lives matter\" was closest to their own personal views when compared to \"black lives matter\" or neither Only 11% said that the statement \"black lives matter\" was closest Nine percent said that neither statement reflected their own personal point of view [415]\n\n\n\"Blue Lives Matter\"\nBlue Lives Matter is a countermovement in the United States supporting law enforcement officers and advocating that those who are prosecuted and convicted of killing law enforcement officers should be sentenced under hate crime statutes [401] [419] It was started in response to Black Lives Matter after the homicides of NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu in Brooklyn, New York on December 20, 2014 [420]\nFollowing the shooting of two police officers in Ferguson and in response to BLM, the hashtag #BlueLivesMatter was created by supporters of the police [408] Following this, Blue Lives Matter became a pro-police officer movement in the United States, expanding after the killings of five police officers by a sniper in Dallas, Texas, who cited police shootings of Black people as his motive [421] [422] [423]\n\n\n\"White Lives Matter\"\nWhite Lives Matter is an activist group created in response to Black Lives Matter In August 2016, the Southern Poverty Law Center added \"White Lives Matter\" to its list of hate groups [430] [431] The group has

October 28, 2017, numerous \"White Lives Matter\" rallies broke out in Tennessee Dominated in Shelbyville particularly, protesters justified their movement in response to the increasing number of immigrants and refugees to Middle Tennessee [433] \"White Lives Matter\" movements have also been present in European football, with instances of corresponding banners being raised at stadiums in the Czech Republic, Ukraine, Hungary, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom [434] White Lives Matter has also been promoted by white nationalists [401]\n\n\nDisinformation\nThe Anti-Defamation League reports numerous attempts to spread disinformation about BLM, citing as examples mid-June 2020 posts \"featuring a sticker instructing people to 'kill a white on sight' spread on Facebook and Twitter The sticker included the hashtags #BlackLivesMatter and #Antifa.\" On Telegram, a \"white supremacist channel encouraged members to distribute the propaganda.\" [435] Another disinformation campaign, originating in June 2020 on 4chan, had the \"goal of getting the hashtags #AllWhitesAreNazis (#AWAN) trending on Twitter Organizers hoped to commandeer hashtags like #BlackLivesMatter and #BLM with a

same treatment that we face as civilians for killing officers.\" [482]\n\nDisconnect from underprivileged communities\nSome black community leaders have come out against the movement as disconnected

Matter**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nBlack Lives Matter is a social movement in the United States that began in 2013, aimed at addressing systemic racism, police brutality, and violence against black people. The movement has gained international attention and support, with protests and rallies held across the globe. This article provides an overview of the Black Lives Matter movement, its history, structure, and strategies, as well as its impact and legacy.\n\n**Structure and Organization**\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement is a decentralized and grassroots movement, with no central leadership or hierarchy. The movement is organized through a network of local chapters and groups, each with its own leadership and decision-making processes. This structure allows for flexibility and adaptability, as well as a sense of ownership and autonomy among local organizers. The movement has also been influenced by other social justice movements, such as the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n**Decentralization**\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement is characterized by its decentralized and horizontal structure, which allows for a high degree of autonomy and decision-making at the local level. This structure is in contrast to traditional social movements, which often have a centralized leadership and a top-down approach. The decentralized structure of the Black Lives Matter movement has allowed it to be more inclusive and representative of diverse voices and perspectives.\n\n**Broader Movement**\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement has also inspired a broader movement involving several other organizations and activists. In 2015, a campaign called Campaign Zero was launched, aimed at promoting policy reforms to end police brutality. The campaign released a ten-point plan for reforms, including ending broken windows theory policing and increasing community oversight of police departments.\n\n**Movement for Black Lives**\n\nIn 2016, a coalition of organizations and activists came together to form the Movement for Black Lives (M4BL). The M4BL is a coalition of over 50 groups representing the interests of black communities across the United States. The coalition includes the Black Lives Matter Network, the National Conference of Black Lawyers, and the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights.\n\n**Funding**\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement has received funding from various sources, including the Democracy Alliance, a gathering of Democratic-Party donors. In 2015, Solidaire, a donor coalition focusing on \"movement building,\" donated over $200,000 to the BLM movement.\n\n**Strategies and Tactics**\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement has employed various strategies and tactics, including social media activism, protests, and direct action. The movement has also used creative and artistic expressions, such as music, dance, and visual arts, to convey its message and mobilize support. In 2015, the movement organized a series of protests and rallies, including a die-in at the Twin Cities Marathon.\n\n**Internet and Social Media**\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement has been highly effective in using social media platforms to reach a wide audience and mobilize support. The hashtag #BlackLivesMatter has been used over 30 million times, making it one of the most popular hashtags in the world. The movement has also used social media to raise awareness about police brutality and systemic racism, and to mobilize support for its causes.\n\n**Direct Action**\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement has also engaged in direct action, including protests, rallies, and die-ins. The movement has used direct action to draw attention to police brutality and systemic racism, and to push for policy reforms and social change.\n\n**Media, Music, and Other Cultural Impacts**\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement has had a significant impact on the media, music, and other cultural industries. The movement has inspired a new generation of artists, musicians, and writers, who are using their work to convey the message of the movement and mobilize support. In 2015, the movement inspired a number of songs, including Michael Jackson's \"They Don't Care About Us\" and Kendrick Lamar's \"Alright.\"\n\n**Allegations of Use of Excessive Force by Police**\n\nAccording to a study from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, between 2002 and 2011, blacks were more likely than whites and Hispanics to perceive the threat or use of nonfatal force as excessive by police. The study found that 2.8% of blacks perceived the threat or use of nonfatal force as excessive, compared to 1.0% of whites and 1.4% of Hispanics.\n\n**Disproportionate Policing of Black Lives Matter Events**\n\nBlack Lives Matter protesters are sometimes subject to excessive policing, including the use of military-grade equipment and surveillance. In 2020, military troops were deployed against Black Lives Matter protesters nationally, and military surveillance aircraft were deployed against subsequent protests.\n\n**International Movement**\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement has inspired similar movements in other countries, including the \"Black Spring\" movement in Africa and the \"Dalit rights\" movement in India. The movement has also been influential in other social justice movements, including the #MeToo movement and the #NeverAgain movement.\n\n**Reactions and Legacy**\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement has had a significant impact on the conversation around systemic racism and police brutality in the United States. The movement has also inspired a new generation of activists and organizers, who are committed to pushing for social change and justice. However, the movement has also faced criticism and backlash, including accusations of being too radical or too focused on a specific issue.\n\n**Criticisms**\n\nSome critics have accused the Black Lives Matter movement of being too focused on a specific issue, such as police brutality, and not addressing broader issues of systemic racism and inequality. Others have criticized the movement for being too radical or too confrontational, and for not working within the established system to bring about change.\n\n**Disconnect from Underprivileged Communities**\n\nSome critics have also accused the Black Lives Matter movement of being disconnected from underprivileged communities, and of not representing the interests of low-income and working-class black people. This criticism has been leveled by some community leaders and activists, who argue that the movement is too focused on middle-class and affluent black people.\n\n**Insufficient Focus on Women**\n\nSome women within the Black Lives Matter movement have also criticized the movement for being insufficiently focused on the experiences and concerns of black women. This criticism has been leveled by some feminist activists and scholars, who argue that the movement is too focused on the experiences of black men and not enough on the experiences of black women.\n\n**Mismanagement of Funds**\n\nThere have also been allegations of mismanagement of funds by the Black Lives Matter movement, including allegations that the movement has used funds for personal gain or for purposes other than those intended. These allegations have been made by some critics and observers, who argue that the movement needs to be more transparent and accountable in its financial dealings.\n\n**Lack of Focus on Unsolved Murders and Missing Persons Cases**\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement has also been criticized for its lack of focus on unsolved murders and missing persons cases, particularly in black communities. This criticism has been leveled by some activists and scholars, who argue that the movement needs to be more focused on addressing these issues and helping to bring closure to families and communities affected by them.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement has had a significant impact on the conversation around systemic racism and police brutality in the United States. The movement has also inspired a new generation of activists and organizers, who are committed to pushing for social change and justice. However, the movement has also faced criticism and backlash, including accusations of being too radical or too focused on a specific issue. Despite these challenges, the movement continues to push for social change and justice, and its legacy will likely be felt for years to come.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Black_Lives_Matter\" following this outline:\n\n\nStructure and organization\nThe phrase \"Black Lives Matter\" can refer to a Twitter hashtag, a slogan, a social movement, a political action committee, [22] or a loose confederation of groups advocating for racial justice As a movement, Black Lives Matter is grassroots and decentralized, and leaders have emphasized the importance of local organizing over national leadership [23] [24] The structure differs from previous black movements, like the Civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s Such differences have been the subject of scholarly literature [25] Activist DeRay McKesson has commented that the movement \"encompasses all who publicly declare that black lives matter and devote their time and energy accordingly.\" [26]\n\n\nDecentralization\nThe phrase \"Black Lives Matter\" can refer to a Twitter hashtag, a slogan, a social movement, a political action committee, [22] or a loose confederation of groups advocating for racial justice As a movement, Black Lives Matter is grassroots and decentralized, and leaders have emphasized the importance of local organizing over national leadership [23] [24] The structure differs from previous black movements, like the Civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s Such differences have been the subject of scholarly literature [25] Activist DeRay McKesson has commented that the movement \"encompasses all who publicly declare that black lives matter and devote their time and energy accordingly.\" [26]\n\n\nBroader movement\nConcurrently, a broader movement involving several other organizations and activists emerged under the banner of \"Black Lives Matter\", as well [33] [34] In 2015, Johnetta Elzie, DeRay Mckesson, Brittany Packnett, and Samuel Sinyangwe initiated Campaign Zero, aimed at promoting policy reforms to end police brutality The campaign released a ten-point plan for reforms to policing, with recommendations including: ending broken windows theory policing, increasing community oversight of police departments, and creating stricter guidelines for the use of force [35] The New York Times reporter, John Eligon, wrote that some activists expressed concerns that the campaign was overly focused on legislative remedies for police violence [36]\n\n\nMovement for Black Lives\nThe Movement for Black Lives (M4BL) is a coalition of more than 50 groups representing the interests of black communities across the United States [38] Members include the Black Lives Matter Network, the National Conference of Black Lawyers, and the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights [39] Endorsed by groups such as Color of Change, Race Forward, Brooklyn Movement Center, PolicyLink, Million Women March Cleveland, and ONE DC, [40] the coalition receives communications and tactical support from an organization named Blackbird [41]\n\n\nFunding\nPolitico reported in 2015 that the Democracy Alliance, a gathering of Democratic-Party donors, planned to meet with leaders of several groups who were endorsing the Black Lives Matter movement [56] According to Politico, Solidaire, the donor coalition focusing on \"movement building\" and led by Texas oil fortune heir Leah Hunt-Hendrix, a member of the Democracy Alliance, had donated more than $200,000 to the BLM movement by 2015 [56]\n\n\nStrategies and tactics\nBlack Lives Matter originally used various social media platforms—including hashtag activism—to reach thousands of people rapidly [60] Since then, Black Lives Matter has embraced a diversity of tactics [61] Black Lives Matter protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful; when violence does occur, it is often committed by counter-protesters [62] [63] [64] Despite this, opponents often try to portray the movement as violent [64] [65]\n\n\nInternet and social media\nIn 2014, the American Dialect Society chose #BlackLivesMatter as their word of the year [66] [67] Yes!

\"Shut this crap down\" [349] [24] The expression \"Shut it down\" would go on to become a popular phrase in Black Lives Matter protests and on social media [24]\n\n\nDemocrats\nAt the Netroots Nation Conference in July 2015, dozens of Black Lives Matter activists took over the stage at an event featuring Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders Activists, including Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors, asked both candidates for specific policy proposals to address deaths in police custody [348] The protesters chanted several slogans, including \"if I die in police custody, burn everything down\" and \"Shut this crap down\" [349] [24] The expression \"Shut it down\" would go on to become a popular phrase in Black Lives Matter protests and on social media [24]\n\n\nRepublicans\nRepublican candidates have been mostly critical of BLM In August 2015, Ben Carson, the only African American vying for the Republican nomination for the presidency, called the movement \"silly\" [371] Carson also said that BLM should care for all black lives, not just a few [372] In the first Republican presidential debate, which took place in Cleveland, one question referenced Black Lives Matter [373] In response to the question, Scott Walker advocated for the proper training of law enforcement [373] and blamed the movement for rising anti-police sentiment, [374] while Marco Rubio was the first candidate to publicly sympathize with the movement's point of view [375]\n\n\nGeneral election\nA group called Mothers of the Movement, which includes the mothers of Michael Brown, Sandra Bland, Eric Garner, and other mothers whose \"unarmed African American children have been killed by law enforcement or due to gun violence,\" [388] addressed the 2016 Democratic National Convention on July 26 [389] [390]\n\n\n2024 United States presidential election\nIn July 2024, Black Lives Matter released a statement opposing the Democratic Party's decision to nominate Kamala Harris for president without a primary election, describing the process as \"anointing\" Harris as the nominee without a public vote [396] [397] The organization argued that installing Harris as the Democratic nominee without a primary vote undermined democratic principles, stating that such a move \"would make the modern Democratic Party a party of hypocrites.\" [398] BLM called on the Democratic National Committee to host a virtual primary to allow voter participation in the nomination process [399]\n\n\nReactions and legacy\nThe United States population's perception of Black Lives Matter has varied consistently and considerably by race and political affiliation [401] [402] A majority of Americans disapproved of the movement through 2018, after which it started gaining wider support Black Lives Matter's popularity surged and reached its highest levels yet in the summer of 2020, when a Pew Research Center poll found that 60% of white, 77% of Hispanic, 75% of Asian and 86% of African-Americans either strongly supported or somewhat supported BLM [19] However, its popularity had declined considerably in September of the same year, when another Pew Research Center poll showed that its overall approval ratings among all American adults had gone down by 12 percentage points to 55%, and that 45% of whites, 66% of Hispanics and 69% of Asians now approved of it [403] Support remained widespread among black-American adults at 87% [403]\n\n\n\"All Lives Matter\"\nThe phrase \"All Lives Matter\" sprang up as a response to the Black Lives Matter movement, shortly after the movement gained national attention [407] [412] Several notable individuals have supported All Lives Matter Its proponents include Senator Tim Scott [413] NFL cornerback Richard Sherman supports the All Lives Matter message, saying \"I stand by what I said that All Lives Matter and that we are human beings.\" [414] According to an August 2015 telephone poll, 78% of likely American voters said that the statement \"all lives matter\" was closest to their own personal views when compared to \"black lives matter\" or neither Only 11% said that the statement \"black lives matter\" was closest Nine percent said that neither statement reflected their own personal point of view [415]\n\n\n\"Blue Lives Matter\"\nBlue Lives Matter is a countermovement in the United States supporting law enforcement officers and advocating that those who are prosecuted and convicted of killing law enforcement officers should be sentenced under hate crime statutes [401] [419] It was started in response to Black Lives Matter after the homicides of NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu in Brooklyn, New York on December 20, 2014 [420]\nFollowing the shooting of two police officers in Ferguson and in response to BLM, the hashtag #BlueLivesMatter was created by supporters of the police [408] Following this, Blue Lives Matter became a pro-police officer movement in the United States, expanding after the killings of five police officers by a sniper in Dallas, Texas, who cited police shootings of Black people as his motive [421] [422] [423]\n\n\n\"White Lives Matter\"\nWhite Lives Matter is an activist group created in response to Black Lives Matter In August 2016, the Southern Poverty Law Center added \"White Lives Matter\" to its list of hate groups [430] [431] The group has also been active in the United Kingdom [432] The \"White Lives Matter\" slogan was chanted by torch-wielding alt-right protesters during the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia On October 28, 2017, numerous \"White Lives Matter\" rallies broke out in Tennessee Dominated in Shelbyville particularly, protesters justified their movement in response to the increasing number of immigrants and refugees to Middle Tennessee [433] \"White Lives Matter\" movements have also been present in European football, with instances of corresponding banners being raised at stadiums in the Czech Republic, Ukraine, Hungary, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom [434] White Lives Matter has also been promoted by white nationalists [401]\n\n\nDisinformation\nThe Anti-Defamation League reports numerous attempts to spread disinformation about BLM, citing as examples mid-June 2020 posts \"featuring a sticker instructing people to 'kill a white on sight' spread on Facebook and Twitter The sticker included the hashtags #BlackLivesMatter and #Antifa.\" On Telegram, a \"white supremacist channel encouraged members to distribute the propaganda.\" [435] Another disinformation campaign, originating in June 2020 on 4chan, had the \"goal of getting the hashtags #AllWhitesAreNazis (#AWAN) trending on Twitter Organizers hoped to commandeer hashtags like #BlackLivesMatter and #BLM with a high volume of tweets—purportedly from Black activist accounts—containing the #AWAN hashtag.\" According to the ADL, the campaign's supporters hoped to sow tension and promote white supremacist accelerationism [436] [437]\n\n\nFake manifesto\nIn June 2020, an unknown party created a website at BLMManifesto.com purporting to be the manifesto of the BLM movement The text mimics a 1919 Italian Fascist Manifesto, modified to relate to racial injustice According to Snopes, the website appears intended to discredit the BLM movement [443]\n\n\nStatistics\nThe United States population's perception of Black Lives Matter varies considerably by race According to a September 2015 poll on race relations, nearly two-thirds of African Americans mostly agree with Black Lives Matter, while 30% of black Americans and 37% of white Americans do not have an opinion about Black Lives Matter [402] Of white people surveyed, 41% thought that Black Lives Matter advocated violence, and 59% of whites thought that Black Lives Matter distracted attention from the real issues of racial discrimination By comparison, 82% of black people polled thought that Black Lives Matter was a nonviolent movement, and 26% of blacks thought that Black Lives Matter distracted attention from the real issues of racial discrimination On the question of whether \"Black Lives Matter\" was mostly a movement or mostly a slogan, 46% of whites and 67% of blacks thought that it is mostly a movement [402] [444] A nationally representative internet survey conducted by the Center for the Study of Diversity and\nDemocracy at Northwestern University found that 82 percent of African Americans believe that the movement is at least moderately effective at achieving its stated goals, although 64 percent of the respondents believed that the movement would be more effective if it had a more centralized leadership structure [25]\n\n\n2020\nWith the resurgence of Black Lives Matter in national headlines amid global protests, the movement saw an increase in support in 2020 [449] [450] Although they began from different perspectives, as per the New York Times' The Upshot, \"all kinds of voters moved sharply in the direction of supporting the movement\" just within the two weeks between late May and early June \"as much as  [they] had in the preceding two years.\" [450] The Pew Research Center reported that \" [m]ost Americans express [ed] support for the Black Lives Matter movement\" during this period [451]\n\n\nNobel Peace Prize nomination\nBlack Lives Matter was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize in January 2021 The nomination was submitted by Norwegian activist and Member of Parliament Petter Eide The award eventually went to journalists Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov [458]\n\n\nCriticisms\nSome conservatives, such as Mike Gonzalez of The Heritage Foundation, [459] have accused Black Lives Matter of being a Marxist movement based on a comment by one of its co-founders saying that she and another co-founder \"are trained Marxists.\" However, PolitiFact noted that \"Black Lives Matter has grown into a national anti-racism movement broadly supported by Americans, few of whom would identify themselves as Marxist.\" [460]\n\n\nIdeology\nSome conservatives, such as Mike Gonzalez of The Heritage Foundation, [459] have accused Black Lives Matter of being a Marxist movement based on a comment by one of its co-founders saying that she and another co-founder \"are trained Marxists.\" However, PolitiFact noted that \"Black Lives Matter has grown into a national anti-racism movement broadly supported by Americans, few of whom would identify themselves as Marxist.\" [460]\n\n\nTactics\nSome black civil rights leaders such as Cecil \"Chip\" Murray, Najee Ali, and Earl Ofari Hutchinson have criticized BLM as disrespectful and ineffective, with Ali claiming \"all they can do is disrupt and make noise.\" [409] Economist Glenn Loury, while supportive of the fundamentals of the movement, has criticized backlash against \"White politicians who state All Lives Matter\" and the apparent polarizing effects of the movement [24]\n\n\nAcademic freedom\nSome academics, including John McWhorter, [465] John Ellis, [466] Marybeth Gasman, [467] and Glenn Loury [468]\nhave criticized some Black Lives Matter activists as silencing speech and repressing academic freedom [469] They claim that the result is self-censorship, reduced academic inquiry, and research bias [470] [471] [469]\nCritics claim academics have been hesitant to speak out against repression for fear of retribution [472] [473] [465]\n\n\nViews on law enforcement\n\nSome critics accuse Black Lives Matter of being anti-police and endorsing violence against the police [401] [479] Sgt Demetrick Pennie of the Dallas Police Department filed an unsuccessful lawsuit against Black Lives Matter in September 2016, which accused the group of inciting a \"race war.\" [480] [481] Marchers using a BLM banner were recorded in a video chanting, \"Pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon\" at the Minnesota State Fair Law enforcement groups claim the chant promotes death to police The protest organizer disputed that interpretation, saying: \"What we are promoting is that if black people who kill police officers are going to fry, then we want police officers to face the same treatment that we face as civilians for killing officers.\" [482]\n\nDisconnect from underprivileged communities\nSome black community leaders have come out against the movement as disconnected from the people it claims to represent [483] In opposing August 2020 budget cuts, New York City Councilman I Daneek Miller, co-chairman of the council's Black, Latino and Asian Caucus opposed reducing police funding and stated, \"Black folks want to be safe like everyone else...we can't allow folks from outside our community to lecture us about Black lives.\" [484] Vanessa Gibson of the Bronx's 16th Council District stated that, \"My working-class people, my homeowners, my tenants, my neighbors—they are not out there screaming and yelling, because they have to work.\" [485] Mayor Ras Baraka of Newark, New Jersey, called \"defund the police\" a \"bourgeois liberal\" solution to racism [483]\n\n\nInsufficient focus on women\nWomen from within the Black Lives Matter movement, including professor and civil rights advocate Treva B Lindsey, have argued that BLM has sidelined black women's experiences in favor of black men's experiences For example, more demonstrations have been organized to protest the killings of Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin than the killings of Pamela Turner, Kayla Moore or Rekia Boyd [486]\n\n\nMismanagement of funds\nAllegations of mismanagement of funds by the organization Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation were raised after funds were used to purchase a home that cost $6 million in southern California to be used as a facility for a Black artists fellowship [489] [490] The property included six bedrooms, a recording studio, and a swimming pool [490]\n\n\nLack of focus on unsolved murders and missing persons cases\nSince its founding, the Black Lives Matter movement has faced significant criticism for its inherent lack of focus on unsolved murders and missing persons cases For example, some researchers have confirmed that murders of Black victims disproportionately go unsolved [491]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nBibliographies\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

With a career spanning over four decades, she has become a household name, known for her versatility and talent in various fields. Born Caryn Elaine Johnson on November 13, 1955, in Manhattan, New York City, Goldberg has achieved immense success in the entertainment industry, earning her a place in the EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony Awards) club.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nGoldberg was born in a public housing project, the Chelsea-Elliot Houses, in New York City. Her father, Robert James Johnson Jr., was a Baptist clergyman, and her mother, Emma Johnson (née Harris), was a nurse and teacher. Goldberg has spoken fondly of her childhood, describing it as \"a blessing\" that allowed her to experience the challenges of growing up in poverty.\n\n**Career**\n\nGoldberg's interest in acting began at a young age, and she attended the HB Studio in New York City, where she trained under the renowned acting teacher Uta Hagen. Her early start in the entertainment industry included appearances in avant-garde films and stage productions. In 1982, she made her film debut in the ensemble feature \"Citizen: I'm Not Losing My Mind, I'm Giving It Away,\" directed by William Farley.\n\n### 1980–1985: Early Work and Breakthrough\n\nDuring the 1980s, Goldberg's career began to take off. She appeared in a string of films, including \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" (1986), \"Burglar\" (1987), and \"Fatal Beauty\" (1987).

In 2020, it was announced that Goldberg would return in \"Sister Act 3,\" with Tyler Perry producing.\n\n**Other Ventures**\n\nIn addition to her acting career, Goldberg has been involved in various other ventures. She has been an advocate for human rights, moderating panels at the Alliance of Youth Movements Summit and the United Nations on topics such as social networks, violent extremism, and reconciliation.\n\nGoldberg has also been involved in the cannabis industry, co-founding the company Whoopi & Maya, which created medical cannabis products for women seeking relief from menstrual cramps. The company ceased operations in 2020, but Goldberg has since announced the launch of a new line of cannabis products, \"Emma & Clyde,\" named after her late mother and brother.\n\n**Media Appearances**\n\nGoldberg has made numerous media appearances throughout her career.

The following month, CBS canceled the season's four remaining episodes after Sheen publicly made offensive comments about the series' creator, Chuck Lorre.

personally signed letters announcing the birth of \"a Prince, conceived in most lawful matrimony between my Lord the King's Majesty and us\" Edward was christened on 15 October, with his 21-year-old half-sister Lady Mary as godmother and his 4-year-old half-sister Lady Elizabeth carrying the chrisom; [6] the Garter King of Arms proclaimed him as Duke of Cornwall and Earl of Chester [7] The queen, however, fell ill and died from postnatal complications on 24 October, days after Edward's birth Henry VIII wrote to Francis I of France that \"Divine Providence .. hath mingled my joy with bitterness of the death of her who brought me this happiness\" [8]\n\n\nUpbringing and education\nEdward was a healthy baby who suckled strongly from the outset His father was delighted with him; in May 1538, Henry was observed \"dallying with him in his arms .. and so holding him in a window to the sight and great comfort of the people\" [11] That September, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Audley, reported Edward's rapid growth and vigour, [11] and other accounts describe him as a tall and merry child The tradition that Edward VI was a sickly boy has been challenged by more recent historians [12] At the age of four, he fell ill with a life-threatening \"quartan fever\", [b] [13] but, despite occasional illnesses and poor eyesight, he enjoyed generally good health until the last six months of his life [c] [14]\n\n\n\"The Rough Wooing\"\nOn 1 July 1543, Henry signed the Treaty of Greenwich with the Scots, sealing the peace with Edward's betrothal to the seven-month-old Mary, Queen of Scots, granddaughter of Edward's aunt and Henry's sister Margaret Tudor The Scots were in a weak bargaining position after their defeat at the Battle of Solway Moss in November 1542, and Henry, seeking to unite the two realms, stipulated that Mary be handed over to him to be brought up in England [34] When the Scots repudiated the treaty in December 1543 and renewed their alliance with France, Henry was enraged In April 1544, he ordered Edward's uncle, Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford, to invade Scotland and \"put all to fire and sword, burn Edinburgh town, so razed and defaced when you have sacked and gotten what ye can of it, as there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon  [them] for their falsehood and disloyalty\" [35] Seymour responded with the most savage campaign ever launched by the English against the Scots [h] The war, which continued into Edward's reign, has become known as \"the Rough Wooing\".\n\n\nAccession\nThe nine-year-old Edward wrote to his father and stepmother on 10 January 1547 from Hertford thanking them for his New Year's gift of their portraits from life [37] By 28 January, Henry VIII was dead Those close to the throne, led by Edward Seymour and William Paget, agreed to delay the announcement of the king's death until arrangements had been made for a smooth succession Seymour and Sir Anthony Browne, the Master of the Horse, rode to collect Edward from Hertford and brought him to Enfield, where Lady Elizabeth was living He and Elizabeth were then told of their father's death and heard a reading of his will [38]\n\n\nSomerset protectorate\nHenry VIII's will named sixteen executors, who were to act as Edward's council until he reached the age of eighteen These executors were supplemented by twelve men \"of counsail\" who would assist the executors when called on [50] The final state of Henry VIII's will has been the subject of controversy Some historians suggest that those close to the king manipulated either him or the will itself to ensure a share-out of power to their benefit, both material and religious In this reading, the composition of the Privy Chamber shifted towards the end of 1546 in favour of the reforming faction [51] In addition, two leading conservative Privy Councillors were removed from the centre of power.\n\n\nCouncil of regency\nHenry VIII's will named sixteen

conservative Privy Councillors were removed from the centre of power.\n\n\nThomas Seymour\nSomerset faced less manageable opposition from his younger brother Thomas, who has been described as a \"worm in the bud\" [69] As King Edward's uncle, Thomas Seymour demanded the governorship of the king's person and a greater share of power [70] Somerset tried to buy his brother off with a barony, an appointment to the Lord Admiralship, and a seat on the Privy Council — but Thomas was bent on scheming for power He began smuggling pocket money to King Edward, telling him that Somerset held the purse strings too tight, making him a \"beggarly king\" [71] He also urged the king to throw off the Protector within two years and \"bear rule as other kings do\"; but Edward, schooled to defer to the council, failed to co-operate [72] In the spring of 1547, using Edward's support to circumvent Somerset's opposition, Thomas Seymour secretly married Henry VIII's widow Catherine Parr, whose Protestant household included the 11-year-old Lady Jane Grey and the 13-year-old Lady Elizabeth [73]\n\n\nWar\nSomerset's only undoubted skill was as a soldier, which he had proven on expeditions to Scotland and in the defence of Boulogne-sur-Mer in 1546 From the first, his main interest as Protector was the war against Scotland [77] After a crushing victory at the Battle of Pinkie in September 1547, he set up a network of garrisons in Scotland, stretching as far north as Dundee [78] His initial successes, however, were followed by a loss of direction, as his aim of uniting the realms through conquest became increasingly unrealistic The Scots allied with France, who sent reinforcements for the defence of Edinburgh in 1548 [79] The Queen of Scots was moved to France, where she was betrothed to the Dauphin [80] The cost of maintaining the Protector's massive armies and his permanent garrisons in Scotland also placed an unsustainable burden on the royal finances [81] A French attack on Boulogne in August 1549 at last forced Somerset to begin a withdrawal from Scotland [82]\n\n\nRebellion\nDuring 1548, England was subject to social unrest After April 1549, a series of armed revolts broke out, fuelled by various religious and agrarian grievances The two most serious rebellions, which required major military intervention to put down, were in Devon and Cornwall and in Norfolk The first sometimes called the Prayer Book Rebellion, arose from the imposition of Protestantism, and the second, led by a tradesman called Robert Kett, mainly from the encroachment of landlords on common grazing ground [83] A complex aspect of the social unrest was that the protesters believed they were acting legitimately against enclosing landlords with the Protector's support, convinced that the landlords were the lawbreakers [m] [84]\n\n\nFall of Somerset\nThe sequence of events that led to Somerset's removal from power has often been called a coup d'état [90] By 1 October 1549, Somerset had been alerted that his rule faced a serious threat He issued a proclamation calling for assistance, took possession of the king's person, and withdrew for safety to the fortified Windsor Castle, where Edward wrote, \"Me thinks I am in prison\" [92] Meanwhile, a united council published details of Somerset's government mismanagement They made clear that the Protector's power came from them, not from Henry VIII's will On 11 October, the council had Somerset arrested and brought the king to Richmond Palace [90] Edward summarised the charges against Somerset in his Chronicle: \"ambition, vainglory, entering into rash wars in mine youth, negligent looking on Newhaven, enriching himself of my treasure, following his own opinion, and doing all by his own authority, etc.\" [93] In February 1550, John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, emerged as the leader of the council and, in effect, as Somerset's successor Although Somerset was released from the Tower and restored to the council, he was executed for felony in January 1552 after scheming to overthrow Dudley's regime [94] Edward noted his uncle's death in his Chronicle: \"the duke of Somerset had his head cut off upon Tower Hill between eight and nine o'clock in the morning\" [95]\n\n\nNorthumberland's leadership\nIn contrast, Somerset's successor the Earl of Warwick, made Duke of Northumberland in 1551, was once regarded by historians merely as a grasping schemer who cynically elevated and enriched himself at the expense of the crown [99] Since the 1970s, the administrative and economic achievements of his regime have been recognised, and he has been credited with restoring the authority of the royal council and returning the government to an even keel after the disasters of Somerset's protectorate [100]\n\n\nReformation\nIn the matter of religion, the regime of Northumberland followed the same policy as that of Somerset, supporting an increasingly vigorous programme of reform [122] Although Edward VI's practical influence on government was limited, his intense Protestantism made a reforming administration obligatory; his succession was managed by the reforming faction, who continued in power throughout his reign The man Edward trusted most, Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, introduced a series of religious reforms that revolutionised the English church from one that—while rejecting papal supremacy—remained essentially Catholic to one that was institutionally Protestant The confiscation of church property that had begun under Henry VIII resumed under Edward—notably with the dissolution of the chantries—to the great monetary advantage of the crown and the new owners of the seized property [123] Church reform was therefore as much a political as a religious policy under Edward VI [124] By the end of his reign, the church had been financially ruined, with much of the property of the bishops transferred into lay hands [125]\n\n\nBetrothal\nAfter the Rough Wooing and Thomas Seymour's plan to marry him off to Lady Jane Grey, the 13-year-old King was betrothed to the five-year-old Elisabeth of Valois, daughter of Henry II of France and Catherine de' Medici, in 1550 [146] The marriage alliance was negotiated in secrecy, although Pope Julius III became aware of the plan and threatened to excommunicate both Henry and Elisabeth if the marriage went forward [146] A dowry of 200,000 écus was agreed to, but was never paid due to Edward's death before marriage Elisabeth later married his sister Mary's widower, Philip II of Spain.\n\n\nDeath and succession crisis\nIn February 1553, Edward VI became ill, and by June, after several improvements and relapses, he was in a hopeless condition [147] The king's death and the succession of his Catholic half-sister Mary would jeopardise the English Reformation, and Edward's council and officers had many reasons to fear it [148] Edward himself opposed Mary's succession, not only on religious grounds but also on those of legitimacy and male inheritance, which also applied to Elizabeth [149] He composed a draft document, headed \"My devise for the succession\", in which he undertook to change the succession, most probably inspired by his father Henry VIII's precedent [150] He passed over the claims of his half-sisters and, at last, settled the Crown on his first cousin once removed, the 16-year-old Lady Jane Grey, who on 25 May 1553 had married Lord Guilford Dudley, a younger son of the Duke of Northumberland [151] In the document he writes:\n\n\nDevise for the succession\nIn

1553 with a fever and cough that gradually worsened The imperial ambassador, Jean Scheyfve, reported that \"he suffers a good deal when the fever is upon him, especially from a difficulty in drawing his breath, which is due to the compression of the organs on the right side\" [177]\n\n\nLady Jane and Queen Mary\nLady Mary was last seen by Edward in February, and was kept informed about the state of her half-brother's health by Northumberland and through her contacts with the imperial ambassadors [190] Aware of Edward's imminent death, she left Hunsdon House, near London, and sped to her estates around Kenninghall in Norfolk, where she could count on the support of her tenants [191] Northumberland sent ships to the Norfolk coast to prevent her escape or the arrival of reinforcements from the continent He delayed the announcement of the king's death while he gathered his forces, and Jane Grey was taken to the Tower on 10 July [192] On the same day, she was proclaimed queen in the streets of London, to murmurings of discontent The Privy Council received a message from Mary asserting her \"right and title\" to the throne and commanding that the council proclaim her queen, as she had already proclaimed herself [193] The council replied that Jane was queen by Edward's authority and that Mary, by contrast, was illegitimate and supported only by \"a few lewd, base people\" [194]\n\n\nProtestant legacy\nAlthough Edward reigned for only six years and died at the age of 15, his reign made a lasting contribution to the English Reformation and the structure of the Church of England [204] The last decade of Henry VIII's reign had seen a partial stalling of the Reformation, a drifting back to Catholic values [205] By contrast, Edward's reign saw radical progress in the Reformation, with the Church transferring from an essentially Catholic liturgy and structure to one that is usually identified as Protestant [u] In particular, the introduction of the Book of Common Prayer, the Ordinal of 1550 and Cranmer's Forty-two Articles formed the basis for English Church practices that continue to this day [207] Edward himself fully approved these changes, and though they were the work of reformers such as Thomas Cranmer, Hugh Latimer and Nicholas Ridley, backed by Edward's determinedly evangelical council, the fact of the king's religion was a catalyst in the acceleration of the Reformation during his reign [208]\n\n\nFamily tree\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en",

He was the son of King Henry VIII and his third wife, Jane Seymour, and was the only son of Henry VIII to outlive him. Edward VI's reign was marked by significant events in English history, including the rise of the English Reformation and the introduction of Protestantism in England. This article will explore Edward VI's life, reign, and legacy in detail.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nEdward was born on 12 October 1537 in his mother's room inside Hampton Court Palace, in Middlesex. He was the son of King Henry VIII by his third wife, Jane Seymour, and was the only son of Henry VIII to outlive him. Throughout the realm, the people greeted the birth of a male heir, \"whom we hungered for so long\", with joy and relief. Te Deums were sung in churches, bonfires lit, and \"their was shott at the Tower that night above two thousand gonnes\". Queen Jane, appearing to recover quickly from the birth, sent out personally signed letters announcing the birth of \"a Prince, conceived in most lawful matrimony between my Lord the King's Majesty and us\". Edward was christened on 15 October, with his 21-year-old half-sister Lady Mary as godmother and his 4-year-old half-sister Lady Elizabeth carrying the chrisom; the Garter King of Arms proclaimed him as Duke of Cornwall and Earl of Chester. The queen, however, fell ill and died from postnatal complications on 24 October, days after Edward's birth. Henry VIII wrote to Francis I of France that \"Divine Providence .. hath mingled my joy with bitterness of the death of her who brought me this happiness\".\n\n**Birth**\n\nEdward was born on 12 October 1537 in his mother's room inside Hampton Court Palace, in Middlesex.

That September, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Audley, reported Edward's rapid growth and vigour, and other accounts describe him as a tall and merry child. The tradition that Edward VI was a sickly boy has been challenged by more recent historians.

education\nEdward was a healthy baby who suckled strongly from the outset His father was delighted with him; in May 1538, Henry was observed \"dallying with him in his arms .. and so holding him in a window to the sight and great comfort of the people\" [11] That September, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Audley, reported Edward's rapid growth and vigour, [11] and other accounts describe him as a tall and merry child The tradition that Edward VI was a sickly boy has been challenged by more recent historians [12] At the age of four, he fell ill with a life-threatening \"quartan fever\", [b] [13] but, despite occasional illnesses and poor eyesight, he enjoyed generally good health until the last six months of his life [c] [14]\n\n\n\"The Rough Wooing\"\nOn 1 July 1543, Henry signed the Treaty of Greenwich with the Scots, sealing the peace with Edward's betrothal to the seven-month-old Mary, Queen of Scots, granddaughter of Edward's aunt and Henry's sister Margaret Tudor The Scots were in a weak bargaining position after their defeat at the Battle of Solway Moss in November 1542, and Henry, seeking to unite the two realms, stipulated that Mary be handed over to him to be brought up in England [34] When the Scots repudiated the treaty in December 1543 and renewed their alliance with France, Henry was enraged In April 1544, he ordered Edward's uncle, Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford, to invade Scotland and \"put all to fire and sword, burn Edinburgh town, so razed and defaced when you have sacked and gotten what ye can of it, as there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon  [them] for their falsehood and disloyalty\" [35] Seymour responded with the most savage campaign ever launched by the English against the Scots [h] The war, which continued into Edward's reign, has become known as \"the Rough Wooing\".\n\n\nAccession\nThe nine-year-old Edward wrote to his father and stepmother on 10 January 1547 from Hertford thanking them for his New Year's gift of their portraits from life [37] By 28 January, Henry VIII was dead Those close to the throne, led by Edward Seymour and William Paget, agreed to delay the announcement of the king's death until arrangements had been made for a smooth succession Seymour and Sir Anthony Browne, the Master of the Horse, rode to collect Edward from Hertford and brought him to Enfield, where Lady Elizabeth was living He and Elizabeth were then told of their father's death and heard a reading of his will [38]\n\n\nSomerset protectorate\nHenry VIII's will named sixteen executors, who were to act as Edward's council until he reached the age of eighteen These executors were supplemented by twelve men \"of counsail\" who would assist the executors when called on [50] The final state of Henry VIII's will has been the subject of controversy Some historians suggest that those close to the king manipulated either him or the will itself to ensure a share-out of power to their benefit, both material and religious In this reading, the composition of the Privy Chamber shifted towards the end of 1546 in favour of the reforming faction [51] In addition, two leading conservative Privy Councillors were removed from the centre of power.\n\n\nCouncil of regency\nHenry VIII's will named sixteen executors, who were to act as Edward's council until he reached the age of eighteen These executors were supplemented by twelve men \"of counsail\" who would assist the executors when called on [50] The final state of Henry VIII's will has been the subject of controversy

composition of the Privy Chamber shifted towards the end of 1546 in favour of the reforming faction [51] In addition, two leading conservative Privy Councillors were removed from the centre of power.\n\n\nThomas Seymour\nSomerset faced less manageable opposition from his younger brother Thomas, who has been described as a \"worm in the bud\" [69] As King Edward's uncle, Thomas Seymour demanded the governorship of the king's person and a greater share of power [70] Somerset tried to buy his brother off with a barony, an appointment to the Lord Admiralship, and a seat on the Privy Council — but Thomas was bent on scheming for power He began smuggling pocket money to King Edward, telling him that Somerset held the purse strings too tight, making him a \"beggarly king\" [71] He also urged the king to throw off the Protector within two years and \"bear rule as other kings do\"; but Edward, schooled to defer to the council, failed to co-operate [72] In the spring of 1547, using Edward's support to circumvent Somerset's opposition, Thomas Seymour secretly married Henry VIII's widow Catherine Parr, whose Protestant household included the 11-year-old Lady Jane Grey and the 13-year-old Lady Elizabeth [73]\n\n\nWar\nSomerset's only undoubted skill was as a soldier, which he had proven on expeditions to Scotland and in the defence of Boulogne-sur-Mer in 1546 From the first, his main interest as Protector was the war against Scotland [77] After a crushing victory at the Battle of Pinkie in September 1547, he set up a network of garrisons in Scotland, stretching as far north as Dundee [78] His initial successes, however, were followed by a loss of direction, as his aim of uniting the realms through conquest became increasingly unrealistic The Scots allied with France, who sent reinforcements for the defence of Edinburgh in 1548 [79] The Queen of Scots was moved to France, where she was betrothed to the Dauphin [80] The cost of maintaining the Protector's massive armies and his permanent garrisons in Scotland also placed an unsustainable burden on the royal finances [81] A French attack on Boulogne in August 1549 at last forced Somerset to begin a withdrawal from Scotland [82]\n\n\nRebellion\nDuring 1548, England was subject to social unrest After April 1549, a series of armed revolts broke out, fuelled by various religious and agrarian grievances The two most serious rebellions, which required major military intervention to put down, were in Devon and Cornwall and in Norfolk The first sometimes called the Prayer Book Rebellion, arose from the imposition of Protestantism, and the second, led by a tradesman called Robert Kett, mainly from the encroachment of landlords on common grazing ground [83] A complex aspect of the social unrest was that the protesters believed they were acting legitimately against enclosing landlords with the Protector's support, convinced that the landlords were the lawbreakers [m] [84]\n\n\nFall of Somerset\nThe sequence of events that led to Somerset's removal from power has often been called a coup d'état [90] By 1 October 1549, Somerset had been alerted that his rule faced a serious threat He issued a proclamation calling for assistance, took possession of the king's person, and withdrew for safety to the fortified Windsor Castle, where Edward wrote, \"Me thinks I am in prison\" [92] Meanwhile, a united council published details of Somerset's government mismanagement They made clear that the Protector's power came from them, not from Henry VIII's will On 11 October, the council had Somerset arrested and brought the king to Richmond Palace [90] Edward summarised the charges against Somerset in his Chronicle: \"ambition, vainglory, entering into rash wars in mine youth, negligent looking on Newhaven, enriching himself of my treasure, following his own opinion, and doing all by his own authority, etc.\" [93] In February 1550, John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, emerged as the leader of the council and, in effect, as Somerset's successor Although Somerset was released from the Tower and restored to the council, he was executed for felony in January 1552 after scheming to overthrow Dudley's regime [94] Edward noted his uncle's death in his Chronicle: \"the duke of Somerset had his head cut off upon Tower Hill between eight and nine o'clock in the morning\" [95]\n\n\nNorthumberland's leadership\nIn contrast, Somerset's successor the Earl of Warwick, made Duke of Northumberland in 1551, was once regarded by historians merely as a grasping schemer who cynically elevated and enriched himself at the expense of the crown [99] Since the 1970s, the administrative and economic achievements of his regime have been recognised, and he has been credited with restoring the authority of the royal council and returning the government to an even keel after the disasters of Somerset's protectorate [100]\n\n\nReformation\nIn the matter of religion, the regime of Northumberland followed the same policy as that of Somerset, supporting an increasingly vigorous programme of reform [122] Although Edward VI's practical influence on government was limited, his intense Protestantism made a reforming administration obligatory; his succession was managed by the reforming faction, who continued in power throughout his reign The man Edward trusted most, Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, introduced a series of religious reforms that revolutionised the English church from one that—while rejecting papal supremacy—remained essentially Catholic to one that was institutionally Protestant The confiscation of church property that had begun under Henry VIII resumed under Edward—notably with the dissolution of the chantries—to the great monetary advantage of the crown and the new owners of the seized property [123] Church reform was therefore as much a political as a religious policy under Edward VI [124] By the end of his reign, the church had been financially ruined, with much of the property of the bishops transferred into lay hands [125]\n\n\nBetrothal\nAfter the Rough Wooing and Thomas Seymour's plan to marry him off to Lady Jane Grey, the 13-year-old King was betrothed to the five-year-old Elisabeth of Valois, daughter of Henry II of France and Catherine de' Medici, in 1550 [146] The marriage alliance was negotiated in secrecy, although Pope Julius III became aware of the plan and threatened to excommunicate both Henry and Elisabeth if the marriage went forward [146] A dowry of 200,000 écus was agreed to, but was never paid due to Edward's death before marriage Elisabeth later married his sister Mary's widower, Philip II of Spain.\n\n\nDeath and succession crisis\nIn February 1553, Edward VI became ill, and by June, after several improvements and relapses, he was in a hopeless condition [147] The king's death and the succession of his Catholic half-sister Mary would jeopardise the English Reformation, and Edward's council and officers had many reasons to fear it [148] Edward himself opposed Mary's succession, not only on religious grounds but also on those of legitimacy and male inheritance, which also applied to Elizabeth [149] He composed a draft document, headed \"My devise for the succession\", in which he undertook to change the succession, most probably inspired by his father Henry VIII's precedent [150] He passed over the claims of his half-sisters and, at last, settled the Crown on his first cousin once removed, the 16-year-old Lady Jane Grey, who on 25 May 1553 had married Lord Guilford Dudley, a younger son of the Duke of Northumberland [151] In the document he writes:\n\n\nDevise for the succession\nIn February 1553, Edward VI became ill, and by June, after several improvements and relapses, he was in a hopeless condition [147] The king's death and the succession of his Catholic half-sister Mary would jeopardise the English Reformation, and Edward's council and officers had many reasons to fear it [148] Edward himself opposed Mary's succession, not only on religious grounds but also on those of legitimacy and male inheritance, which also applied to Elizabeth [149] He composed a draft document, headed \"My devise for the succession\", in which he undertook to change the succession, most probably inspired by his father Henry VIII's precedent [150] He passed

of the Duke of Northumberland [151] In the document he writes:\n\n\nIllness and death\nEdward had become ill during January 1553 with a fever and cough that gradually worsened The imperial ambassador, Jean Scheyfve, reported that \"he suffers a good deal when the fever is upon him, especially from a difficulty in drawing his breath, which is due to the compression of the organs on the right side\" [177]\n\n\nLady Jane and Queen Mary\nLady Mary was last seen by Edward in February, and was kept informed about the state of her half-brother's health by Northumberland and through her contacts with the imperial ambassadors [190] Aware of Edward's imminent death, she left Hunsdon House, near London, and sped to her estates around Kenninghall in Norfolk, where she could count on the support of her tenants [191] Northumberland sent ships to the Norfolk coast to prevent her escape or the arrival of reinforcements from the continent He delayed the announcement of the king's death while he gathered his forces, and Jane Grey was taken to the Tower on 10 July [192] On the same day, she was proclaimed queen in the streets of London, to murmurings of discontent The Privy Council received a message from Mary asserting her \"right and title\" to the throne and commanding that the council proclaim her queen, as she had already proclaimed herself [193] The council replied that Jane was queen by Edward's authority and that Mary, by contrast, was illegitimate and supported only by \"a few lewd, base people\" [194]\n\n\nProtestant legacy\nAlthough Edward reigned for only six years and died at the age of 15, his reign made a lasting contribution to the English Reformation and the structure of the Church of England [204] The last decade of Henry VIII's reign had seen a partial stalling of the Reformation, a drifting back to Catholic values [205] By contrast, Edward's reign saw radical progress in the Reformation, with the Church transferring from an essentially Catholic liturgy and structure to one that is usually identified as Protestant [u] In particular, the introduction of the Book of Common Prayer, the Ordinal of 1550 and Cranmer's Forty-two Articles formed the basis for English Church practices that continue to this day [207] Edward himself fully approved these changes, and though they were the work of reformers such as Thomas Cranmer, Hugh Latimer and Nicholas Ridley, backed by Edward's determinedly evangelical council, the fact of the king's religion was a catalyst in the acceleration of the Reformation during his reign [208]\n\n\nFamily tree\n\n\nSee

The character has a complex and varied history, with roots in pre-Christian pagan traditions and influences from Catholicism. Krampus is often associated with the Feast of St. Nicholas, a holiday celebrated on December 6 in many European countries.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe etymology of Krampus is uncertain, with various theories suggesting that the name may come from the Bavarian word \"krampn,\" meaning \"dead\" or \"rotten,\" or the German word \"kramp/krampen,\" meaning \"claw.\" These theories are not universally accepted, and the true origin of the name remains a topic of debate.\n\n**Origins**\n\nThe Krampus is thought to be inspired by other mythical creatures from Alpine folklore, such as the Perchten or Straggele. While there are no written sources before the 16th century, it is likely that the character has its roots in pre-Christian pagan traditions. The Catholic Church played a significant role in shaping the mythology of Krampus, often depicting the creature as a demonic figure to be feared and punished.\n\n**Modern History**\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1932 election in Austria, the Krampus tradition was prohibited by the Dollfuss regime under the clerical fascist Fatherland Front (Vaterländische Front) and the Christian Social Party. This ban was likely intended to suppress the pagan roots of the Krampus mythology and promote a more Christianized version of the holiday.\n\n**Appearance**\n\nKrampus is typically depicted as a hairy, half-goat, half-demon creature, with one foot that has the cloven hooves and horns of a goat. He is often shown with a long, pointed tongue and fangs, giving him a fearsome and intimidating appearance. The character's appearance has varied over time, with some depictions showing him as more monstrous and others as more humanoid.\n\n**Jewish Physiognomy Stereotypes and Anti-Semitic Undertones**\n\nKrampus' appearance and features are characterized by horns, hooves, fur, hooked nose, beard, dark hair, fangs, and a long tongue. Scholars have noted that the hooked nose and grotesque features mirror the antisemitic images of Jews in historical central European art. This similarity raises questions about the implicit messages conveyed through Krampus' portrayal, and some have argued that the character's depiction reflects anti-Semitic stereotypes and prejudices.\n\n**Krampusnacht**\n\nThe Feast of St. Nicholas is celebrated in parts of Europe on December 6. On the preceding evening of December 5, Krampus Night or Krampusnacht, the wicked hairy devil appears on the streets. Sometimes accompanying St. Nicholas and sometimes on his own, Krampus visits homes and businesses, dispensing coal and the Rute, a bundle of twigs, to naughty children. The Saint usually appears in the Eastern Rite vestments of a bishop, carrying a golden ceremonial staff.\n\n**Perchtenlauf and Krampuslauf**\n\nThere were already established pagan traditions in the Alpine regions that became intertwined with Catholicism. People would masquerade as a devilish figure known as Percht, a two-legged humanoid goat with a giraffe-like neck, wearing animal furs. People wore costumes and marched in processions known as Perchtenlaufen, which are regarded as an earlier form of the Krampus runs. Perchtenlaufen were looked at with suspicion by the Catholic Church and banned by some civil authorities. Due to sparse population and rugged environments within the Alpine region, the ban was not effective or easily enforced, rendering the ban useless.\n\n**Criticism of the Krampus Run**\n\nEvery year there are arguments during Krampus runs. Occasionally spectators take revenge for whippings and attack Krampuses. In 2013, after several Krampus runs in East Tyrol, a total of eight injured people (mostly with broken bones) were admitted to the Lienz district hospital and over 60 other patients were treated on an outpatient basis.\n\n**Krampuskarten**\n\nEuropeans have been exchanging greeting cards featuring Krampus since the 19th century. Sometimes introduced with Gruß vom Krampus (Greetings from Krampus), the cards usually have humorous rhymes and poems. Krampus is often featured looming menacingly over children. He is also shown as having one human foot and one cloven hoof. In some, Krampus has sexual overtones; he is pictured pursuing buxom women. Over time, the representation of Krampus in the cards has changed; older versions have a more frightening Krampus, while modern versions have a cuter, more Cupid-like creature.\n\n**Regional Variation**\n\nKrampus appears in the folklore of Austria, Bavaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Northern Italy (Autonomous Province of Trento, South Tyrol, and Friuli-Venezia Giulia), Slovakia, and Slovenia.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nThe character of Krampus has been imported and modified for various North American media, including print, television, video games, and film. Krampus, a comic book series from Image Comics, was created by Dean Kotz and Brian Joines in 2013. A 2015 Christmas comedy horror film from Universal Pictures, also titled Krampus, was released and became a commercial success.\n\n**Biology**\n\nProtomelas krampus, a freshwater actinopterygian fish, is named after Krampus.\n\n**Gallery**\n\nSee the gallery of Krampus images and depictions from various cultures and time periods.\n\n**See Also**\n\nOther figures from Alpine folklore, such as the Perchten and Straggele.\n\n**Related Figures**\n\nOther mythological creatures with similar characteristics, such as the Devil and the Goblin.\n\n**Other**\n\nKrampus has a rich and complex history, with roots in pre-Christian pagan traditions and influences from Catholicism. The character has been depicted in various forms of media, including literature, film, and art. Krampus remains a popular figure in Alpine folklore, and his mythology continues to evolve and adapt to modern times.\n\n**References**\n\nBibliography:\n\n* \"Krampus: The Devil of Christmas\" by Monte Beauchamp\n* \"Krampus: The Yule Lord\" by Gerald Brom\n* \"The History of Krampus\" by Thomas A.

he is pictured pursuing buxom women [36] Over time, the representation of Krampus in the cards has changed; older versions have a more frightening Krampus, while modern versions have a cuter, more Cupid-like creature [citation needed] Krampus has also adorned postcards and candy containers [37]\n\n\nRegional variation\nKrampus appears in the folklore of Austria, Bavaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Northern Italy (Autonomous Province of Trento, South Tyrol, and Friuli-Venezia Giulia), Slovakia, and Slovenia [38]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nThe character of Krampus has been imported and modified for various North American media, [21] [46] including print (e.g., Krampus: The Devil of Christmas, a collection of vintage postcards by Monte Beauchamp in 2004; [35] [47] Krampus: The Yule Lord, a 2012 novel by Gerald Brom [48]), Krampus, a comic book series from Image Comics in 2013 created by Dean Kotz and Brian Joines, television – both live action (\"A Krampus Carol\", a 2012 episode of The League [46]) and animation (\"A Very Venture Christmas\", a 2004 episode of The Venture Bros.;

then-girlfriend Rose McGowan's 1999 film Jawbreaker; Asia Argento's 2004 film The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things; Rise; The Hire: Beat The Devil, the sixth installment in the BMW films series; and Showtime's comedy-drama TV series Californication in 2013, in which Manson portrayed himself He also appeared on HBO's Eastbound & Down, [137] of which Manson is reportedly a longtime fan, [138] and had lobbied to appear on for years; and ABC's Once Upon a Time, for which he provided the voice of the character \"Shadow\" [139]\n\n\nArt\nManson stated in a 2004 interview with i-D magazine to have begun his career as a watercolor painter in 1999 when he made five-minute concept pieces and sold them to drug dealers On September 13–14, 2002, his first show, The Golden Age of Grotesque, was held at the Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions Centre Art in America's Max Henry likened them to the works of a \"psychiatric patient given materials to use as therapy\" and said his work would never be taken seriously in a fine art context, writing that the value was \"in their celebrity, not the work\" [151] On September 14–15, 2004, Manson held a second exhibition on the first night in Paris and the second in Berlin The show was named 'Trismegistus' which was also the title of the center piece of the exhibit – a large, three-headed Christ painted onto an antique wood panel from a portable embalmers table.\n\n\nVideo games\nHe's a master of culture jamming, industry trolling and arcane songcraft who nonchalantly shrugs off character assassination attempts, a glass of absinthe in his hand .. Last but certainly not least, Manson's got a whip-smart intellect and the gift of gab.\n\n\nHell, etc.\nHell, etc was Manson's third art exhibition, held in Athens, Greece The exhibition was open to the public from April 28, 2010 until May 2, 2010 Manson's more recent artworks and newly revealed pieces at the time, were displayed The art exhibition was scheduled to run until April 25, 2010, however due to a volcanic ash cloud, it was postponed to run from April 28, 2010 until May 2, 2010 [155] The exhibition was held at the Athenian Cultural Centre The exhibition opened at 10:00 daily and was open until 22:00 Flash photography was prohibited inside the exhibition, as the watercolor paintings were extremely sensitive to the flash [156]\n\n\nOther ventures\nManson launched \"Mansinthe\", his own brand of Swiss-made absinthe, which has received mixed reviews; some critics described the taste as being \"just plain\", [157] but it came second to Versinthe in an Absinthe top five [158] and won a gold medal at the 2008 San Francisco World Spirits Competition [159] Other reviewers, such as critics at The Wormwood Society, have given the absinthe moderately high praise [160] In 2015, Manson stated he was no longer drinking absinthe [161] [162]\n\n\nVocal style\nManson predominantly delivers lyrics in a melodic fashion, [163] although he invariably enhances his vocal register by utilizing several extended vocal techniques, such as vocal fry, [164] screaming, [165] growling [166] and crooning [167] [168] In one interview he claimed his voice has five different tones, [169] which mixing engineer Robert Carranza discovered can form a pentagram when imported into a phrasal analyzer [170] [171] He possesses a baritone vocal type, [172] and has a vocal range which spans three octaves [173] His lowest bass note of A1 can be heard in \"Arma-goddamn-motherfuckin-geddon\", while his highest note, an E6 — the first note of the whistle register — can be heard on the Born Villain song \"Hey, Cruel World...\" [174]\n\n\nName\nThe name Marilyn Manson is formed by a juxtaposition of two opposing American pop cultural icons: Marilyn Monroe and Charles Manson [175] Monroe, an actress, was one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s and continues to be a major icon over 50 years after, [176] while Manson, a cult leader, was responsible for the murder of actress Sharon Tate, as well as several others; and served a life sentence on murder and conspiracy charges until his death in 2017 [177] [178]\n\n\nLawsuits\nIn September 1996, former bassist Gidget Gein negotiated a settlement with Manson where he would receive US$17,500 and 20 percent of any royalties paid for recordings and for any songs he had a hand in writing and his share of any other royalties or fees the group earned while he was a member and he could market himself as a former member of Marilyn Manson This settlement was not honored [188]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nManson has supported various charitable causes throughout his career In 2002, he worked with the Make-A-Wish Foundation to collaborate with a fan who had been diagnosed with a life-threatening illness 16-year-old Andrew Baines from Tennessee was invited into the band's recording studio to record backing vocals for their then-upcoming album, The Golden Age of Grotesque His website read: \"Yesterday, I spent the afternoon with Andrew, who reminded me the things I create are only made complete by those who enjoy them I just want to simply say, thank you to Andrew for sharing such an important wish with me.\" [209] [210] He contributed to Oxfam's 2013 \"Rumble in the Jumble\" event, which raised money to aid victims of domestic and sexual abuse in the Democratic Republic of the Congo [211] He has supported various organizations – such as Music for Life and Little Kids Rock — which enable access to musical instruments and education to children of low-income families He has also worked with Project Nightlight, a group that encourages children and teenagers to speak out against physical and sexual abuse [212] In 2019, he performed alongside Cyndi Lauper at her annual 'Home for the Holidays' benefit concert, with all proceeds donated to Lauper's True Colors United, which \"works to develop solutions to youth homelessness that focus on the unique experiences of LGBTQ young people\" [213] [214]\n\n\nPersonal life\nManson was engaged to actress Rose McGowan from February 1999 to January 2001 McGowan later ended their engagement, citing \"lifestyle differences\" [215]\n\n\nRelationships\nManson was engaged to actress Rose McGowan from February 1999 to January 2001 McGowan later ended their engagement, citing \"lifestyle differences\" [215]\n\n\nBeliefs\nManson claims he was a friend of Anton LaVey, [228] and early on had also claimed LaVey inducted him as a minister in the Church of Satan Later in his career, Manson downplayed this, saying he was \"not necessarily\" a minister: \"that was something earlier.. it was a friend of mine who's now dead, who was a philosopher that I thought I learned a lot from And that was a title I was given, so a lot of people made a lot out of it But it's not a real job, I didn't get paid for it.\" [229] The Church of Satan itself later confirmed Manson was never ordained as a minister in their church, explaining \"he was given an honorary priesthood for his real world accomplishments at the time\" [230]\n\n\nControversies\nMarilyn Manson has been referred to as one of the most iconic and controversial figures in heavy metal music, [235] [236] [237] [238] [239] with some referring to him as a \"pop culture icon\" [240] [241] [242] [243] Paste magazine said there were \"few artists in the 90s as shocking as Marilyn Manson, the most famous of the shock-rockers\" [244] In her book Music in American Life: An Encyclopedia of the Songs, Styles, Stars, and Stories That Shaped Our Culture, author Jacqueline Edmondson writes that Manson creates music that \"challenges people's worldviews and provokes questions and further thinking\" [245] Manson, his work, and the work of his eponymous band, have been involved in numerous controversies throughout their career [246] [247]\n\n\nColumbine High School shooting\nOn April 20, 1999, Columbine High School students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed thirteen people and wounded twenty-four others before committing suicide [263] [264] In the immediate aftermath of the massacre, media reports surfaced that were heavily critical of Goth subculture, [265] [266] alleging the perpetrators were wearing Marilyn Manson T-shirts during the massacre, [267] and that they were influenced by violence in entertainment, specifically movies, video games and music [268] Five days after the incident, William Bennet and Joseph Lieberman – longtime critics of the vocalist – appeared on Meet the Press, where they cited his music as a contributing factor to the shooting [269] Soon after, sensationalist headlines such as \"Killers Worshipped Rock Freak Manson\" and \"Devil-Worshipping Maniac Told Kids To Kill\" began appearing in media coverage of the tragedy [270] [271] Despite confirmation that the pair were fans of German industrial bands such as KMFDM and Rammstein, [272] [273] and had \"nothing but contempt\" for Manson's music, [274] mainstream media continued to direct the majority of blame for the shooting at Manson [275] [276]\n\n\nOther alleged incidents\nIn 2000, an elderly nun was murdered by three schoolgirls in Italy, with their diaries reportedly containing numerous references to and pictures of Manson [288] Soon after, he was arrested following a concert in Rome for allegedly \"tearing off his genitals\" [288] Manson said the arrest was politically motivated following his implication in the murder by Italian tabloids [289] In 2003, French media [which?] blamed Manson when several teenagers vandalized the graves of British war heroes in Arras, France [288]\n\n\nAbuse allegations\nIn 2018, actor Charlyne Yi accused Manson of harassing them and other women on the set of the series House [313] Several of Manson's former acquaintances began communicating with one another in September 2020 [314] [315] In a letter dated January 21, 2021, California State Senator Susan Rubio wrote to the director of the FBI and the U.S Attorney General, asking them to investigate allegations several women had made against Manson [316] On February 1, former fiancée Evan Rachel Wood wrote on Instagram and in a statement to Vanity Fair, accusing Manson of being abusive during their relationship a decade earlier [317] Four other women simultaneously issued statements also accusing Manson of abuse [318] Wood continued to make allegations against Manson and his wife Lindsay Usich on Instagram, claiming that his alleged abuse included antisemitism, [319] and said she filed a report with the Los Angeles Police Department against Usich for threatening to leak photographs of Wood dressed in a Nazi uniform while wearing an Adolf Hitler-style toothbrush moustache [320] A total of sixteen people have made various allegations against Manson, [3] [321] including five accusations of sexual assault [322]\n\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n\n\nGuest appearances in music

"article": "**Marilyn Manson**\n\nMarilyn Manson is an American singer, songwriter, actor, and visual artist. He is best known as the lead singer and founder of the industrial metal band Marilyn Manson, which has released several successful albums and singles since its formation in 1990.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nBrian Hugh Warner, later known as Marilyn Manson, was born on January 5, 1969, in Canton, Ohio. He is the son of Barbara J. Wyer and Hugh Angus Warner. Manson's family has a complex and troubled history, with his father being a salesman and his mother being a nurse. Manson has stated that his childhood was marked by feelings of isolation and loneliness, which would later influence his music and art.\n\n**Career**\n\nManson formed Marilyn Manson & the Spooky Kids in 1989, along with guitarist Scott Putesky. The band quickly developed a loyal fanbase within the South Florida punk and hardcore music scene, primarily due to their intentionally shocking concerts. Band members often performed in women's clothing or bizarre costumes, and live shows routinely featured amateur pyrotechnics, naked women nailed to crucifixes, children locked in cages, and experiments in reverse psychology and butchered animal remains.\n\nWithin six months of forming, Marilyn Manson & the Spooky Kids were playing sold-out shows in 300-capacity nightclubs throughout Florida. They signed a record deal with Sony Music in early 1991, although this deal was rescinded before any material was recorded for the label. The band instead used the proceeds of this deal to fund the recording of subsequent demo tapes, which were released independently.\n\n**Music**\n\nMarilyn Manson's music is a fusion of industrial, metal, and rock, with a focus on dark and often provocative lyrics. The band's early work was characterized by its use of distorted, industrial soundscapes and Manson's screamed vocals. Over time, the band's sound has evolved to incorporate more melodic and accessible elements, while maintaining its dark and introspective tone.\n\nManson has collaborated extensively with other musicians, including cello rock act Rasputina, which opened for the band throughout the \"Dead to the World Tour\". Manson has also created three remixes of the song \"Transylvanian Concubine\", two of which appeared on their 1997 EP Transylvanian Regurgitations.\n\n**Film and Television**\n\nManson made his film debut in 1997, as an actor in David Lynch's Lost Highway. He has since appeared in many minor roles and cameos, including Party Monster; then-girlfriend Rose McGowan's 1999 film Jawbreaker; Asia Argento's 2004 film The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things; Rise; The Hire: Beat The Devil, the sixth installment in the BMW films series; and Showtime's comedy-drama TV series Californication in 2013, in which Manson portrayed himself.\n\n**Art**\n\nManson has stated that he began his career as a watercolor painter in 1999, when he made five-minute concept pieces and sold them to drug dealers. His first art exhibition, \"The Golden Age of Grotesque\", was held at the Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions Centre in 2002. The exhibition was widely criticized for its perceived lack of artistic merit, with many viewing it as a publicity stunt.\n\nManson's subsequent art exhibitions have been met with similar criticism, with many viewing them as a way for the artist to generate publicity and attention. Despite this, Manson has continued to produce and exhibit his art, often incorporating elements of performance and installation into his work.\n\n**Video Games**\n\nManson has made several appearances in video games, including as a character in the 1999 game Area 51 and as a voice actor in the 2004 game God of War II. He has also appeared in several music videos, including for the songs \"The Beautiful People\" and \"Tainted Love\".\n\n**Tours**\n\nMarilyn Manson has embarked on several tours throughout his career, including the \"Dead to the World Tour\" and the \"The High End of Low Tour\".

Last but certainly not least, Manson's got a whip-smart intellect and the gift of gab.\n\n\nHell, etc.\nHell, etc was Manson's third art exhibition, held in Athens, Greece The exhibition was open to

\"Mansinthe\", his own brand of Swiss-made absinthe, which has received mixed reviews; some critics described the taste as being \"just plain\", [157] but it came second to Versinthe in an Absinthe top five [158] and won a gold medal at the 2008 San Francisco World Spirits Competition [159] Other reviewers, such as critics at The Wormwood Society, have given the absinthe moderately high praise [160] In 2015, Manson stated he was no longer drinking absinthe [161] [162]\n\n\nVocal style\nManson predominantly delivers lyrics in a melodic fashion, [163] although he invariably enhances his vocal register by utilizing several extended vocal techniques, such as vocal fry, [164] screaming, [165] growling [166] and crooning [167] [168] In one interview he claimed his voice has five different tones, [169] which mixing engineer Robert Carranza discovered can form a pentagram when imported into a phrasal analyzer [170] [171] He possesses a baritone vocal type, [172] and has a vocal range which spans three octaves [173] His lowest bass note of A1 can be heard in \"Arma-goddamn-motherfuckin-geddon\", while his highest note, an E6 — the first note of the whistle register — can be heard on the Born Villain song \"Hey, Cruel World...\" [174]\n\n\nName\nThe name Marilyn Manson is formed by a juxtaposition of two opposing American pop cultural icons: Marilyn Monroe and Charles Manson [175] Monroe, an actress, was one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s and continues to be a major icon over 50 years after, [176] while Manson, a cult leader, was responsible for the murder of actress Sharon Tate, as well as several others; and served a life sentence on murder and conspiracy charges until his death in 2017 [177] [178]\n\n\nLawsuits\nIn September 1996, former bassist

other royalties or fees the group earned while he was a member and he could market himself as a former member of Marilyn Manson This settlement was not honored [188]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nManson has

this, saying he was \"not necessarily\" a minister: \"that was something earlier.. it was a friend of mine who's now dead, who was a philosopher that I thought I learned a lot from And that was a title I was given, so a lot of people made a lot out of it But it's not a real job, I didn't get paid for it.\" [229] The Church of Satan itself later confirmed Manson was never ordained as a minister in their church, explaining \"he was given an honorary priesthood for his real world accomplishments at the time\" [230]\n\n\nControversies\nMarilyn Manson has been referred to as one of the most iconic and controversial figures in heavy metal music, [235] [236] [237] [238] [239] with some referring to him as a \"pop culture icon\" [240] [241] [242] [243] Paste magazine said there were \"few artists in the 90s as shocking as Marilyn Manson, the most famous of the shock-rockers\" [244] In her book Music in American Life: An Encyclopedia of the Songs, Styles, Stars, and Stories That Shaped

and Dylan Klebold killed thirteen people and wounded twenty-four others before committing suicide [263] [264] In the immediate aftermath of the massacre, media reports surfaced that were heavily critical of Goth subculture, [265] [266] alleging the perpetrators were wearing Marilyn Manson T-shirts during the massacre, [267] and that they were influenced by violence in entertainment, specifically movies, video games and music [268] Five days after the incident, William Bennet and Joseph Lieberman – longtime critics of the vocalist – appeared on Meet the Press, where they cited his music as a contributing factor to the shooting [269] Soon after, sensationalist headlines such as \"Killers Worshipped Rock Freak Manson\" and \"Devil-Worshipping Maniac Told Kids To Kill\" began appearing in media coverage of the tragedy [270] [271] Despite confirmation that the pair were fans of German industrial bands such as KMFDM and Rammstein, [272] [273] and had \"nothing but contempt\" for Manson's music, [274] mainstream media continued to direct the majority of blame for the shooting at Manson [275] [276]\n\n\nOther alleged incidents\nIn 2000, an elderly nun was murdered by three schoolgirls in Italy, with their diaries reportedly containing numerous references to and pictures of Manson [288] Soon after, he was arrested following a concert in Rome for allegedly \"tearing off

on Instagram and in a statement to Vanity Fair, accusing Manson of being abusive during their relationship a decade earlier [317] Four other women simultaneously issued statements also accusing Manson of abuse [318] Wood continued to make allegations against Manson and his wife Lindsay Usich on Instagram, claiming that his alleged abuse included antisemitism, [319] and said she filed a report with the Los Angeles Police Department against Usich for threatening to leak photographs of Wood dressed in a Nazi uniform while wearing an Adolf Hitler-style toothbrush moustache [320] A total of sixteen

Some zombies are slow and easy to defeat, while others are fast and aggressive. The game's day-night cycle affects the behavior of the zombies, with most becoming more aggressive at night.\n\n**Plot**\n\nAiden's quest to find a cure for the Harran Virus takes him through the city of Villedor, where he must navigate the dangers of the city and confront various factions vying for power.

Despatch box performances\" by Major, [30] which included highlighting for Major \"a dreadful piece of doublespeak\" by Tony Blair (then the Labour Employment spokesman) over the effect of a national minimum wage [31] He became head of the political section of the Conservative Research Department, and in August 1991 was tipped to follow Judith Chaplin as political secretary to the prime minister [32]\n\n\nConservative Research Department\nAfter graduation, Cameron worked for the Conservative Research Department between September 1988 and 1993 His first brief was Trade and Industry, Energy and Privatisation; he befriended fellow young colleagues, including Edward Llewellyn, Ed Vaizey and Rachel Whetstone They and others formed a group they called the \"Smith Square set\", which was dubbed the \"Brat Pack\" by the press, though it is better known as the \"Notting Hill set\", a name given to it pejoratively by Derek Conway [29] In 1991 Cameron was seconded to Downing Street to work on briefing John Major for the then twice-weekly sessions of Prime Minister's Questions One newspaper gave Cameron the credit for \"sharper ..

It's time to return to our tax-cutting agenda The socialist prime ministers of Europe have endorsed Tony Blair because they want a federal pussy cat and not a British lion.\" [60]\n\n\nParliamentary backbencher\nUpon his election to Parliament, Cameron served as a member of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, a prominent appointment for a newly elected MP He proposed that the Committee launch an inquiry into the law on drugs, [72] and urged the consideration of \"radical options\" [73] The report recommended a downgrading of ecstasy from Class A to Class B, as well as moves towards a policy of 'harm reduction', which Cameron defended [74]\n\n\nParliamentary frontbencher\nIn June 2003 Cameron was appointed a shadow minister in the Privy Council Office as a deputy to Eric Forth, then shadow leader of the House He also became a vice-chairman of the Conservative Party when Michael Howard took over the leadership in November of that year He was appointed Opposition frontbench local government spokesman in 2004, before being promoted to the Shadow Cabinet that June as head of policy co-ordination Later, he became Shadow Education Secretary in the post-election reshuffle [80] [81]\n\n\nTerm as Leader of the Opposition (2005–2010)\nFollowing the Labour victory in the May 2005 general election, Michael Howard announced his resignation as leader of the Conservative Party and set a lengthy timetable for the leadership election Cameron announced on 29 September 2005 that he would be a candidate Parliamentary colleagues supporting him included Boris Johnson, shadow chancellor George Osborne, shadow defence secretary and deputy leader of the party Michael Ancram, Oliver Letwin [85] and former party leader William Hague [86] His campaign did not gain wide support until his speech, delivered without notes, at the 2005 Conservative party conference In the speech, he vowed to make people \"feel good about being Conservatives again\" and said he wanted \"to switch on a whole new generation.\" [87] His speech was well-received; The Daily Telegraph said speaking without notes \"showed a sureness and a confidence that is greatly to his credit\" [88]\n\n\nLeadership election\nFollowing the Labour victory in the May 2005 general election, Michael Howard announced his resignation as leader of the Conservative Party and set a lengthy timetable

generation.\" [87] His speech was well-received; The Daily Telegraph said speaking without notes \"showed a sureness and a confidence that is greatly to his credit\" [88]\n\n\nReaction to Cameron as Leader\nCameron's relative youth and inexperience before becoming leader invited satirical comparison with Tony Blair Private Eye soon published a picture of both leaders on its front cover, with the caption \"World's first face transplant a success\" [93] On the left, the New Statesman unfavourably likened his \"new style of politics\" to Tony Blair's early leadership years [94] Cameron was accused of paying excessive attention to appearance: ITV News broadcast footage from the 2006 Conservative Party Conference in Bournemouth showing him wearing four different sets of clothes within a few hours [95] In his column for The Guardian, comedy writer and broadcaster Charlie Brooker described the Conservative leader as \"a hollow Easter egg with no bag of sweets inside\" in April 2007 [96]\n\n\nAllegations of recreational drug use\nDuring the leadership election, allegations were made that Cameron had used cannabis and cocaine recreationally before becoming an MP [105] Pressed on this point during the BBC television programme Question Time, Cameron expressed the view that everybody was allowed to \"err and stray\" in their past [106] During his 2005 Conservative leadership campaign, he addressed the question of drug consumption by remarking: \"I did lots of things before I came into politics which I shouldn't have done We all did.\" [106]\n\n\nShadow Cabinet appointments\nHis Shadow Cabinet appointments included MPs associated with the various wings of the party Former leader William Hague was appointed to the foreign affairs brief, while both George Osborne and David Davis were retained, as shadow chancellor of the Exchequer and Shadow Home Secretary, respectively Hague, assisted by Davis, stood in for Cameron during his paternity leave in February 2006 [107] In June 2008 Davis announced his intention to resign as an MP, and was immediately replaced as shadow home secretary by Dominic Grieve; Davis' surprise move was seen as a challenge to the changes introduced under Cameron's leadership [108]\n\n\nEuropean Conservatives and Reformists\nDuring his successful 2005 campaign to be elected leader of the Conservative Party, Cameron pledged that the Conservative Party's members of the European Parliament would leave the European People's Party group, which had a \"federalist\" approach to the European Union [110] Once elected, Cameron began discussions with right-wing and Eurosceptic parties in other European countries, mainly in eastern Europe; in July 2006, he concluded an agreement to form the Movement for European Reform with the Czech Civic Democratic Party, leading to the formation of a new European Parliament group, the European Conservatives and Reformists, in 2009 after the European Parliament elections [111]\nCameron attended a gathering at Warsaw's Palladium cinema celebrating the foundation of the alliance [112]\n\n\nShortlists for Parliamentary candidates\nSimilarly, Cameron's initial \"A-List\" of prospective parliamentary candidates was attacked by members of his party, [114] and the policy was discontinued in favour of gender-balanced final shortlists Before being discontinued, the policy had been criticised by senior Conservative MP and former Prisons Spokeswoman Ann Widdecombe as an \"insult to women\", and she had accused Cameron of \"storing up huge problems for the future.\" [115]\n\n\nSouth Africa\nIn April 2009 The Independent reported that in 1989, while Nelson Mandela remained imprisoned under the apartheid regime, Cameron had accepted a trip to South Africa paid for by an anti-sanctions lobby firm A spokesperson for him responded by saying that the Conservative Party was at that time opposed to sanctions against South Africa and that his trip was a fact-finding mission However, the newspaper reported that Cameron's then superior at Conservative Research Department called the trip \"jolly\", saying that \"it was all terribly relaxed, just a little treat, a perk of the job The Botha regime was attempting to make itself look less horrible, but I don't regard it as having been of the faintest political consequence.\" Cameron distanced himself from his party's history of opposing sanctions against the regime He was criticised by Labour MP Peter Hain, himself an anti-apartheid campaigner [116]\n\n\nRaising teaching standards\nAt the launch of the Conservative Party's education manifesto in January 2010, Cameron declared an admiration for the \"brazenly elite\" approach to education of countries such as Singapore and South Korea, and expressed a desire to \"elevate the status of teaching in our country\" [117] He suggested the adoption of more stringent criteria for entry to teaching, and offered repayment of the loans of maths and science graduates obtaining first or 2.1 degrees from \"good\" universities [118]\n\n\nExpenses\n\nDuring the parliamentary expenses scandal in 2009 Cameron said he would lead Conservatives in repaying \"excessive\" expenses and threatened to expel MPs that refused, after the expense claims of several members of his shadow cabinet had been questioned:\n\n2010 general election\nThe Conservatives had last won a general election in 1992 The 2010 general election resulted in the Conservatives, led by Cameron, winning the largest number of seats (306) This was, however, 20 seats short of an overall majority, and resulted in the nation's first hung parliament since February 1974 [125]\n\n\n2010 government formation\nTalks between Cameron and then Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg led to an agreed Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition In late 2009 Cameron had urged the Liberal Democrats to join the Conservatives in a new \"national movement\", saying there was \"barely a cigarette paper\" between them on a large number of issues The invitation was rejected at the time by Clegg who said that the Conservatives were totally different from his party, and that the Lib Dems were the true \"progressives\" in UK politics [126]\n\n\nPremiership (2010–2016)\nElizabeth II, following Gordon Brown's resignation as prime minister on 11 May 2010, extended an invitation to Cameron to establish a new administration based on Brown's recommendation [127] At age 43, Cameron became the youngest prime minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812, beating the record previously set by Tony Blair in May 1997 [128] In his first address outside 10 Downing Street, he announced his intention to form a coalition government, the first since the Second World War, with the Liberal Democrats [129]\n\n\nEconomy\nIn response to the Great Recession, Cameron undertook the austerity programme This was a deficit reduction programme consisting of sustained reductions in public spending, intended to reduce the government budget deficit and the welfare state in the United Kingdom The National Health Service [142] and education [143] were \"ringfenced\" and protected from direct spending cuts [144] Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne claimed they aimed to eliminate the structural deficit (i.e deficit on current spending as opposed to investment), and to have government debt falling as a percentage of GDP [145] By 2015 the deficit as a percentage of GDP had reduced to half what it was in 2010 [145]\n\n\nImmigration\nCameron said immigration from outside the EU should be subject to annual limits He said in July 2013 that \"in the last decade we have had an immigration policy that's completely lax The pressure it puts on our public services and communities is too great.\" [146] In 2015 The Independent reported: \"The Conservatives have failed spectacularly to deliver their pledge to reduce net migration to less than 100,000 a year The Office for National Statistics (ONS) announced a net flow of 298,000 migrants to the UK in the 12 months to September 2014—up from 210,000 in the previous year.\" [147]\n\n\nDefence and foreign affairs\nIn 2014 Cameron dismissed warnings that his cuts to the UK defence budget had left it less than a \"first class-player in terms of defence\" and no longer a \"full partner\" to the United States [148]\n\n\nDefence cuts\nIn 2014 Cameron dismissed warnings that his cuts to the UK defence budget had left it less than a \"first class-player in terms of defence\" and no longer a \"full partner\" to the United States [148]\n\n\nNATO military intervention in Libya\nCameron condemned the violence used against anti-Gaddafi protesters at the beginning of the Libyan Civil War [150] After weeks of lobbying by the UK and its allies, on 17 March 2011, the United Nations Security Council approved a no-fly zone to prevent government forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi from carrying out air attacks on anti-Gaddafi rebels [151] Two days later, the UK and the United States fired more than 110 Tomahawk missiles at targets in Libya [152]\n\n\nFalklands\nIn 2013 in response to Argentina's calls for negotiations over the Falkland Islands' sovereignty, a referendum was called, asking Falkland Islanders whether they supported the continuation of their status as an Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom With a turnout of 91.94%, an overwhelming 99.8% voted to remain a British territory, with only three votes against [162] In light of this, Cameron said: \"We believe in the Falkland islanders' right to self-determination They had a referendum They couldn't have been more clear about wanting to remain with our country and we should protect and defend them\" [163]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia\nCameron supported Britain's close relationship with Saudi Arabia [164] In January 2015 he travelled to the Saudi capital Riyadh to pay his respects, following the death of the nation's King Abdullah According to WikiLeaks, Cameron initiated a secret deal with Saudi Arabia, ensuring both countries were elected onto the UN Human Rights Council [165] The same year his government announced \"firm political support\" for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against the Shi'a Houthis, [166] re-supplying the Saudi military with weapons and providing them with training [167] [168] [169]\n\n\nSri Lanka\nCameron reiterated calls for an independent investigation into the alleged war crimes during the final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War [170] \"There needs to be proper inquiries into what happened at the end of the war, there needs to be proper human rights, democracy for the Tamil minority in that country\" Cameron stated [171] [172] He stated that, if this investigation was not completed by March 2014, he would press for an independent international inquiry [173] [174] [175] This followed a visit to Jaffna, a war-ravaged town in the northern part of Sri Lanka; Cameron was the first foreign leader to visit Jaffna since the island once colonised by Britain became independent in 1948 [176] [177] Cameron was mobbed by demonstrators, mostly women, seeking his assistance in tracing missing relatives [178] [179]\n\n\nTurkey\nIn a speech in Ankara in July 2010, Cameron stated unequivocally his support for Turkey's accession to the EU, citing economic, security and political considerations, and claimed that those who opposed Turkish membership were driven by \"protectionism, narrow nationalism or prejudice\" [180] [181] In that speech, he was also critical of Israeli action during the Gaza flotilla raid and its Gaza policy, and repeated his opinion that Israel had turned Gaza into a \"prison camp\", [180] having previously referred to Gaza as \"a giant open prison\" [182] These views were met with mixed reactions [183] [184] The Cameron government declined to formally recognise the Ottoman Empire's massacres of Armenians as a \"genocide\" [185]\n\n\nIsrael\nIn January 2024, Cameron dismissed South Africa's ICJ genocide case against Israel as \"nonsense\", saying that Israel is \"a democracy, a country with the rule of law, a country with armed forces that are committed to obeying the rule of law\" [271]\n\n\nMilitary intervention in Iraq and Syria\nIn August 2013 Cameron lost a motion in favour of bombing Syrian armed forces in response to the Ghouta chemical attack, becoming the first prime minister to suffer such a foreign-policy defeat since 1782 [195] In September 2014, MPs passed a motion in favour of British planes joining, at the request of the Iraqi government, a bombing campaign against Islamic State (IS) targets in Iraq; [196] the motion explicitly expressed parliament's disapproval of UK military action in Syria [197] Cameron promised that, before expanding UK air strikes and ground support to include IS units in Syria, he would seek parliamentary approval [198]\n\n\n2015 general election\nCameron was re-elected UK prime minister on 7 May 2015 with a majority in the Commons [209] The Conservative Party's decisive victory in the general election was a surprise, as most polls and commentators had suggested the outcome was too close to call and that the result would be a second hung parliament [210] Cameron said of his first term when returned as prime minister for a second term that he was \"proud to lead the first coalition government in 70 years\" and offered particular thanks to Clegg for his role in it [211] Forming the first Conservative majority government elected since 1992, David Cameron became the first prime minister to be re-elected immediately after a full term with a larger popular vote share since Lord Salisbury at the 1900 general election.\n\n\n2016 referendum and resignation\nAs promised in the election manifesto, Cameron set a date for a referendum on whether the UK should remain a member of the European Union, and announced that he would be campaigning for Britain to remain within a \"reformed EU\" [214] The terms of the UK's membership of the EU were re-negotiated, with agreement reached in February 2016 [215] The option to leave came to be known as Brexit (a portmanteau of \"British\" and \"exit\").\n\n\nPost-premiership (2016–present)\nIn October 2016 Cameron became chairman of the National Citizen Service Patrons [232] In January 2017, he was appointed president of Alzheimer's Research UK to address misconceptions surrounding dementia and campaign for medical research funding to tackle the condition [233]\n\n\nPositions\nIn October 2016 Cameron became chairman of the National Citizen Service Patrons [232] In January 2017, he was appointed president of Alzheimer's Research UK to address misconceptions surrounding dementia and campaign for medical research funding to tackle the condition [233]\n\n\nBrexit\nCameron maintained a low profile following his resignation as prime minister and the subsequent Brexit negotiations In January 2019, following May's defeat in the House of Commons over her draft withdrawal agreement, Cameron gave a rare interview to reporters outside his house in Notting Hill, saying he backed May's Brexit deal with the EU and did not regret calling the 2016 referendum [237] However, he later said that the outcome of the referendum had left him \"hugely depressed\", and told The Times he knew \"some people will never forgive me\" He confessed: \"Every single day I think about it, and the fact that we lost, and the consequences, and the things that could have been done differently, and I worry desperately\" [238]\n\n\nMemoir\nCameron published a memoir, For the Record, on 19 September 2019 through HarperCollins [240] He was reported to have signed an £800,000 contract for the book [241] According to the Guardian, the book was initially scheduled for 2018, but was delayed so Cameron would not be perceived as a \"backstreet driver\" in the ongoing Brexit negotiations [240] [242] The book gives an insight into his life at 10 Downing Street, as well as inside explanations of the decisions taken by his government Cameron said that his aim in writing the book was to \"correct the record\" where he thought it was wrong [243]\n\n\nGreensill scandal\nDuring Cameron's premiership, the financier Lex Greensill was an unpaid advisor who had access to eleven government departments [244] In 2018 he became an advisor to Greensill Capital and held share options in the company [245] reportedly worth as much as $60 million as well as being paid over $1 million each year for 25 days' work per year [244] [246] A Panorama investigation concluded that, overall, through a combination of his salary and share sales, Cameron earned around $10 million before tax for 30 months' part-time work [247]\n\n\nNYU Abu Dhabi\nIn January 2023, Cameron was assigned to teach politics in a three-week course at New York University Abu Dhabi He was to lecture students on \"practising politics and government in the age of disruption\", which included topics like the Ukraine war and migration crisis [258]\n\n\nMigrant crisis\nIn May 2023 Cameron expressed support for the Rwanda asylum plan and Suella Braverman's policies against illegal immigration into the UK, arguing in an interview with LBC: \"I think if you don't have a better answer to the things that the government is doing to try and stop this illegal trade, then I think there's no point criticising.\" [259] [260]\n\n\nCOVID-19 Inquiry\nCameron gave evidence to the UK COVID-19 Inquiry on 19 June 2023 [261]\n\n\nForeign Secretary (2023–2024)\nIn Rishi Sunak's cabinet reshuffle on 13 November 2023, Cameron was appointed Foreign Secretary, replacing James Cleverly, who became Home Secretary It was also announced simultaneously that he would receive a life peerage, thus making Cameron a member of the House of Lords and the first former prime minister to be raised to the peerage since Margaret Thatcher [262] He was created Baron Cameron of Chipping Norton, of Chipping Norton in the County of Oxfordshire on 17 November 2023 [263] [264] Cameron was introduced to the House of Lords on 20 November, supported by Nicholas True, Baron True and Susan Williams, Baroness Williams of Trafford [265] [266]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nCameron described himself in December 2005 as a \"modern compassionate conservative\" and spoke of a need for a new style of politics, saying that he was \"fed up with the Punch and Judy politics of Westminster\" [287] He was \"certainly a big Thatcher fan, but I don't know whether that makes me a Thatcherite\", [288] saying he was a \"liberal Conservative\", though \"not a deeply ideological person.\" [289] As leader of the opposition, Cameron asserted that he did not intend to oppose the government as a matter of course, and would offer his support in areas of agreement He has urged politicians to concentrate more on improving people's happiness and \"general well-being\", instead of focusing solely on \"financial wealth\" [290] There were claims that he described himself to journalists at a dinner during the leadership contest as the \"heir to Blair\" [291]\n\n\nSelf-description

himself to journalists at a dinner during the leadership contest as the \"heir to Blair\" [291]\n\n\nHome affairs\nIn 2006 Cameron described poverty as a \"moral disgrace\" [299] and promised to tackle relative poverty [300] In 2007 Cameron promised: \"We can make British poverty history, and we will make British poverty history\" The same year he also stated: \"Ending child poverty is central to improving child well-being\" [301] In 2015 Polly Toynbee questioned Cameron's commitment to tackling poverty, contrasting his earlier statements agreeing that \"poverty is relative\" with proposals to change the government's poverty measure, and saying that cuts in child tax credits would increase child poverty among low-paid working families [302] Cameron denied that austerity had contributed to the 2011 England riots, instead blaming street gangs and opportunistic looters [303]\n\n\nPoverty\nIn 2006 Cameron described poverty as a \"moral disgrace\" [299] and promised to tackle

the 2011 England riots, instead blaming street gangs and opportunistic looters [303]\n\n\nLGBT rights\nIn 2010 Cameron was given a score of 36% in favour of lesbian, gay and bisexual equality by Stonewall [304] Prior to 2005 Cameron was opposed to gay rights, calling it a \"fringe agenda\" and attacking Prime Minister Tony Blair for \"moving heaven and earth to allow the promotion of homosexuality in our schools\" by repealing the anti-gay Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988 [305] Cameron is recorded by Hansard as having voted against same-sex adoption rights in 2002, but he denies this, claiming he abstained from the three-line whip imposed on him by his party In 2008, he wanted lesbians who receive IVF treatment to be required to name a father figure, which received condemnation from LGBT equality groups [305] However, Cameron supported commitment for gay couples in a 2005 speech, and in October 2011 urged Conservative MPs to support gay marriage [297]\n\n\nMarriage and family values\nIn 2009 Cameron said \"the restoration of family values and a new commitment to economic and social responsibility\" were \"key to repairing 'broken Britain'\" [312] In 2013 Cameron described himself as \"a marriage man, I am a great supporter of marriage I want to promote marriage, defend marriage, encourage marriage.\" As such, he rejected calls from Conservative MP Christopher Chope to extend civil partnership rights to heterosexual couples, saying: \"I think we should be promoting marriage rather than looking at any other way of weakening it.\" [313] In 2018 the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that this position was discriminatory [314]\n\n\nComments on other parties and politicians\nCameron criticised Gordon Brown (when Brown was Chancellor of the Exchequer) for being \"an analogue politician in a digital age\" and referred to him as \"the roadblock to reform\" [315] As prime minister, he reacted to press reports that Brown could be the next head of the International Monetary Fund by hinting that he may block the appointment, citing the huge national debt that Brown left the country with as a reason for Brown not being suitable for the role [316]\n\n\nForeign affairs\nIn an interview on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross in 2006, Cameron said that he supported the decision of the then Labour Government to go to war in Iraq, and said that he thought supporters should \"see it through\" [326] He also supported a motion brought by the SNP and Plaid Cymru in 2006, calling for an inquiry into the government's conduct of the Iraq war In 2011 he oversaw the withdrawal of British soldiers from Iraq He repeatedly called for the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq war to conclude and publish its findings, saying: \"People want to know the truth\" [327]\n\n\nIraq War\nIn an interview on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross in 2006, Cameron said that he supported the decision of the then Labour Government to go to war in Iraq, and said

[329]\n\n\nIsrael\nIn January 2024, Cameron dismissed South Africa's ICJ genocide case against Israel as \"nonsense\", saying that Israel is \"a democracy, a country with the rule of law, a country with armed forces that are committed to obeying the rule of law\" [271]\n\n\nChina\nIn October 2015 Xi Jinping, the president of the People's Republic of China, paid a state visit to the United Kingdom under the Premiership of Cameron Such episodes including the Chinese leader famously having a pint with Cameron at a local pub in Buckinghamshire, [334] and Queen Elizabeth hailing the visit as \"milestone\" during state banquet, [335] symbolised the increased cordiality between China and the United Kingdom under Cameron, in spite of the controversies around the state visit and the concerns with China's superpower status The state visit was the third formal Anglo–Chinese diplomatic meetings, which involves either head of states or head of governments, following Cameron's visit to China in 2013 and then–Premier Li Keqiang's UK visit in 2014; the year 2015 alone also marked an unprecedented level of bilateral meetings and visits [336]\n\n\nRussia\nIn the years after Cameron became UK prime minister, UK relations with Russia initially showed a marked improvement In 2011 Cameron visited Russia, and in 2012, Putin visited the UK for the first time in seven years, holding talks with Cameron, and also visiting the 2012 London Olympics together [341]\n\n\nPolitical image\nIn April 2016 then Labour MP for Bolsover, Dennis Skinner was reprimanded by House Speaker John Bercow for referring to Cameron as 'Dodgy Dave' (related to Skinner's contention of Cameron's dishonesty) in a parliamentary debate about the Panama Papers Skinner was instructed by Bercow to repeat his question without referring to Cameron using the adjective 'dodgy' When Skinner repeated his question, once again referring to Cameron as 'Dodgy Dave', he was ordered to leave parliament for the remainder of that day's session [345] [346] In July 2016, Skinner once again referred to Cameron as 'Dodgy Dave' in parliament, however this time he was not reprimanded, or asked to leave [347]\n\n\n\"Dodgy Dave\" moniker\nIn April 2016 then Labour MP for Bolsover, Dennis Skinner was reprimanded by House Speaker John Bercow for referring to Cameron as 'Dodgy Dave' (related to Skinner's contention of Cameron's dishonesty) in a parliamentary debate about the Panama Papers Skinner was instructed by Bercow to repeat his question without referring to Cameron using the adjective 'dodgy'

again referred to Cameron as 'Dodgy Dave' in parliament, however this time he was not reprimanded, or asked to leave [347]\n\n\nAllegations of social elitism\nAs leader of the Conservative Party, Cameron was accused of relying on \"old-boy networks\", and criticised by his party for the imposition of selective shortlists of women and ethnic minority prospective parliamentary candidates [353] [114] Several of Cameron's senior appointments, such as George Osborne as chancellor of the Exchequer, are former members of the Bullingdon Club Michael Gove conceded it was \"ridiculous\" how many fellow Cabinet ministers were old Etonians, though he placed the blame on the failings of the state education system rather than Cameron [354] However, Michael Mosbacher, co-founder of Standpoint, wrote that Cameron's cabinet has the lowest number of Etonians of any past Conservative government: \"David Cameron's government is the least patrician, least wealthy and least public-school-educated—indeed the least Etonian Conservative-led government this country has ever seen\" [355]\n\n\nPlots against leadership\nFollowing poor results in the May 2012 local elections after a difficult few months for the government, with Labour increasing its lead in the polls, there were concerns from Conservative MPs about Cameron's leadership and his electability David Davies, the chairman of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee, accused the Conservative leadership of \"incompetence\", and hinted that it could risk Cameron's leadership [356] Nadine Dorries warned the Prime Minister that a leadership challenge could happen [357]\n\n\nCameron and Andy Coulson\nIn 2007 Cameron appointed Andy Coulson, former editor of the News of the World, as his director of communications Coulson had resigned as the paper's editor following the conviction of a reporter in relation to illegal phone hacking, although stating that he knew nothing about it [360] [361] In June 2010, Downing Street confirmed Coulson's annual salary as £140,000, the highest pay of any special adviser to UK Government [362]\n\n\nCameron and Michael Ashcroft\nAlthough Lord Michael Ashcroft played a significant role in the 2010 election, he was not offered a ministerial post [368] In June 2012, shortly before a major Conservative rebellion on House of Lords reform, [369] journalist Peter Oborne credited Ashcroft with \"stopping the Coalition working\" by moving policy on Europe, welfare, education and taxation to the right [368] According to Oborne, Ashcroft, owner of both the ConservativeHome and PoliticsHome websites and a \"brutal critic of the Coalition from the start\", had established \"megaphone presence\" in the on-line media He believes Cameron's philosophy of liberal conservatism has been destroyed by \"coordinated attacks on the Coalition\" and \"the two parties are no longer trying to pretend that they are governing together.\" [368]\n\n\nStanding in opinion polls\nAn ICM poll in September 2007 saw Cameron rated the least popular of the three main party leaders [378] [379] A YouGov poll on party leaders conducted on 9–10 June 2011 found 44% of the electorate thought he was doing well and 50% thought he was doing badly, while 38% thought he would be the best PM and 35% did not know [380] In the run up to the 2015 election, Cameron achieved his first net positive approval rating in four years, with a YouGov poll finding 47% of voters thought he was doing well as prime minister compared with 46% who thought he was doing badly [381]\n\n\nEvaluations of premiership\nIn the months immediately following his resignation from the post of prime minister, a number of commentators gave negative evaluations of Cameron's premiership The University of Leeds' 2016 survey of post-war prime ministers, which collected the views of 82 academics specialising in the history and politics of post-war Britain, ranked Cameron as the third-worst prime minister since 1945, ranking above only Alec Douglas-Home and Anthony Eden 90% of respondents cited his calling and losing of the Brexit referendum as his greatest failure [385]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nCameron made a cameo appearance in the BBC television programme Top Gear's India Special, where he tells the trio of Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond to \"stay away from India\" after initially denying the group's request to improve economic relations with India in a letter and suggested that they mend fences with Mexico He later stated through his aides that he did not like the special that he cameoed in, and that he had the \"utmost respect\" for the people of India [386] Cameron was portrayed by comedian Jon Culshaw in ITV's satirical sketch show Newzoids, [387] and by Mark Dexter in the Channel 4 television films Coalition and Brexit: The Uncivil War In 2019 he was interviewed for The Cameron Years, a BBC mini-documentary series on his premiership [388]\n\n\nPersonal life\nCameron married Samantha Sheffield, the daughter of Sir Reginald Sheffield, 8th Baronet, and Annabel Lucy Veronica Jones (later Viscountess Astor) in 1996 [394] They have had four children Their first child, Ivan Reginald Ian, was born on 8 April 2002 in Hammersmith and Fulham, London, with a rare combination of cerebral palsy and a form of severe epilepsy called Ohtahara syndrome, requiring round-the-clock care Recalling the receipt of this news, Cameron was quoted as saying: \"The news hits you like a freight train .. You are depressed for a while because you are grieving for the difference between your hopes and the reality But then you get over that, because he's wonderful.\" [395] Ivan was cared for at the specialist NHS Cheyne Day Centre in West London, which closed shortly after he left it Ivan died at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London, on 25 February 2009, aged six [396]\n\n\nFamily\nCameron married Samantha Sheffield, the daughter of Sir Reginald Sheffield, 8th Baronet, and Annabel Lucy Veronica Jones (later Viscountess Astor) in 1996 [394] They have had four children Their first child, Ivan Reginald Ian, was born on 8 April 2002 in Hammersmith and Fulham, London, with a rare combination of cerebral palsy and a form of severe epilepsy called Ohtahara syndrome, requiring round-the-clock care Recalling the receipt of this news, Cameron was quoted as saying: \"The news hits you like a freight train ..

He has two sisters and an elder brother, Alexander Cameron. Cameron is the younger son of Ian Donald Cameron, a stockbroker, and his wife Mary Fleur, a retired Justice of the Peace and daughter of Sir William Mount, 2nd Baronet. He is also a descendant of William IV through one of the king's illegitimate children.\n\nEarly Life and Education\nCameron was educated at two private schools. From the age of seven, he was taught at Heatherdown School in Winkfield, Berkshire. Owing to good grades, he entered its top academic class almost two years early. At the age of 13, he went on to Eton College in Berkshire, following his father and elder brother. His early interest was in art. Six weeks before taking his O levels, he was caught smoking cannabis. He admitted the offense and had not been involved in selling drugs, so he was not expelled; instead he was fined, prevented from leaving the school grounds and given a \"Georgic\" (a punishment that involved copying 500 lines of Latin text).\n\nEarly Career\nAfter graduating, Cameron worked for the Conservative Research Department between September 1988 and 1993. His first brief was Trade and Industry, Energy and Privatisation; he befriended fellow young colleagues, including Edward Llewellyn, Ed Vaizey and Rachel Whetstone. They and others formed a group they called the \"Smith Square set\", which was dubbed the \"Brat Pack\" by the press, though it is better known as the \"Notting Hill set\", a name given to it pejoratively by Derek Conway.\n\nConservative Research Department\nAfter graduating, Cameron worked for the Conservative Research Department between September 1988 and 1993.

They and others formed a group they called the \"Smith Square set\", which was dubbed the \"Brat Pack\" by the press, though it is better known as the \"Notting Hill set\", a name given to it pejoratively by Derek Conway.\n\nSpecial Adviser to the Chancellor\nThe Conservatives' unexpected success in the 1992 election led Cameron to hit back at older party members who had criticized him and his colleagues, saying \"whatever people say about us, we got the campaign right\", and that they had listened to their campaign workers on the ground rather than the newspapers. Cameron was rewarded with a promotion to Special Adviser to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont.\n\nSpecial Adviser to the Home Secretary\nAfter Lamont was sacked, Cameron remained at the Treasury for less than a month before being specifically recruited by Home Secretary Michael Howard. It was commented that he was still \"very much in favour\" and it was later reported that many at the Treasury would have preferred Cameron to carry on. At the beginning of September 1993, he applied to go on Conservative Central Office's list of prospective parliamentary candidates (PPCs).\n\nParliamentary Candidacies\nHaving been approved for the PPCs' list, Cameron began looking for a seat to contest for the 1997 general election. He was reported to have missed out on selection for Ashford in December 1994, after failing to get to the selection meeting as a result of train delays. In January 1996, when two shortlisted contenders dropped out, Cameron was interviewed and subsequently selected for Stafford, a constituency revised in boundary changes, which was projected to have a Conservative majority.\n\nParliamentary Backbencher\nUpon his election to Parliament, Cameron served as a member of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, a prominent appointment for a newly elected MP. He proposed that the Committee launch an inquiry into the law on drugs, and urged the consideration of \"radical options\".\n\nParliamentary Frontbencher\nIn June 2003 Cameron was appointed a shadow minister in the Privy Council Office as a deputy to Eric Forth, then shadow leader of the House. He also became a vice-chairman of the Conservative Party when Michael Howard took over the leadership in November of that year. He was appointed Opposition frontbench local government spokesman in 2004, before being promoted to the Shadow Cabinet that June as head of policy co-ordination. Later, he became Shadow Education Secretary in the post-election reshuffle.\n\nTerm as Leader of the Opposition (2005–2010)\nFollowing the Labour victory in the May 2005 general election, Michael Howard announced his resignation as leader of the Conservative Party and set a lengthy timetable for the leadership election. Cameron announced on 29 September 2005 that he would be a candidate. Parliamentary colleagues supporting him included Boris Johnson, shadow chancellor George Osborne, shadow defence secretary and deputy leader of the party Michael Ancram, Oliver Letwin, and former party leader William Hague. His campaign did not gain wide support until his speech, delivered without notes, at the 2005 Conservative party conference. In the speech, he vowed to make people \"feel good about being Conservatives again\" and said he wanted \"to switch on a whole new generation.\" His speech was well-received; The Daily Telegraph said speaking without notes \"showed a sureness and a confidence that is greatly to his credit.\"\n\nLeadership Election\nFollowing the Labour victory in the May 2005 general election, Michael Howard announced his resignation as leader of the Conservative Party and set a lengthy timetable for the leadership election.

In the speech, he vowed to make people \"feel good about being Conservatives again\" and said he wanted \"to switch on a whole new generation.\" His speech was well-received; The Daily Telegraph said speaking without notes \"showed a sureness and a confidence that is greatly to his credit.\"\n\nReaction to Cameron as Leader\nCameron's relative youth and inexperience before becoming leader invited satirical comparison with Tony Blair. Private Eye soon published a picture of both leaders on its front cover, with the caption \"World's first face transplant a success.\" On the left, the New Statesman unfavourably likened his \"new style of politics\" to Tony Blair's early leadership years. Cameron was accused of paying excessive attention to appearance: ITV News broadcast footage from the 2006 Conservative Party Conference in Bournemouth showing him wearing four different sets of clothes within a few hours. In his column for The Guardian, comedy writer and broadcaster Charlie Brooker described the Conservative leader as \"a hollow Easter egg with no bag of sweets inside\" in April 2007.\n\nAllegations of Recreational Drug Use\nDuring the leadership election, allegations were made that Cameron had used cannabis and cocaine recreationally before becoming an MP. Pressed on this point during the BBC television programme Question Time, Cameron expressed the view that everybody was allowed to \"err and stray\" in their past. During his 2005 Conservative leadership campaign, he addressed the question of drug consumption by remarking: \"I did lots of things before I came into politics which I shouldn't have done. We all did.\"\n\nShadow Cabinet Appointments\nHis Shadow Cabinet appointments included MPs associated with the various wings of the party. Former leader William Hague was appointed to the foreign affairs brief, while both George Osborne and David Davis were retained, as shadow chancellor of the Exchequer and Shadow Home Secretary, respectively. Hague, assisted by Davis, stood in for Cameron during his paternity leave in February 2006. In June 2008 Davis announced his intention to resign as an MP, and was immediately replaced as shadow home secretary by Dominic Grieve; Davis' surprise move was seen as a challenge to the changes introduced under Cameron's leadership.\n\nEuropean Conservatives and Reformists\nDuring his successful 2005 campaign to be elected leader of the Conservative Party, Cameron pledged that the Conservative Party's members of the European Parliament would leave the European People's Party group, which had a \"federalist\" approach to the European Union. Once elected, Cameron began discussions with right-wing and Eurosceptic parties in other European countries, mainly in eastern Europe; in July 2006, he concluded an agreement to form the Movement for European Reform with the Czech Civic Democratic Party, leading to the formation of a new European Parliament group, the European Conservatives and Reformists, in 2009 after the European Parliament elections. Cameron attended a gathering at Warsaw's Palladium cinema celebrating the foundation of the alliance.\n\nShortlists for Parliamentary Candidates\nSimilarly, Cameron's initial \"A-List\" of prospective parliamentary candidates was attacked by members of his party, and the policy was discontinued in favour of gender-balanced final shortlists. Before being discontinued, the policy had been criticised by senior Conservative MP and former Prisons Spokeswoman Ann Widdecombe as an \"insult to women\", and she had accused Cameron of \"storing up huge problems for the future.\"\n\nSouth Africa\nIn April 2009 The Independent reported that in 1989, while Nelson Mandela remained imprisoned under the apartheid regime, Cameron had accepted a trip to South Africa paid for by an anti-sanctions lobby firm A spokesperson for him responded by saying that the Conservative Party was at that time opposed to sanctions against South Africa and that his trip was a fact-finding mission However, the newspaper reported that Cameron's then superior at Conservative Research Department called the trip \"jolly\", saying that \"it was all terribly relaxed, just a little treat, a perk of the job The Botha regime was attempting to make itself look less horrible, but I don't regard it as having been of the faintest political consequence.\" Cameron distanced himself from his party's history of opposing sanctions against the regime He was criticised by Labour MP Peter Hain, himself an anti-apartheid campaigner.\n\nRaising Teaching Standards\nAt the launch of the Conservative Party's education manifesto in January 2010, Cameron declared an admiration for the \"brazenly elite\" approach to education of countries such as Singapore and South Korea, and expressed a desire to \"elevate the status of teaching in our country\". He suggested the adoption of more stringent criteria for entry to teaching, and offered repayment of the loans of maths and science graduates obtaining first or 2.1 degrees from \"good\" universities.\n\nExpenses\nDuring the parliamentary expenses scandal in 2009 Cameron said he would lead Conservatives in repaying \"excessive\" expenses and threatened to expel MPs that refused, after the expense claims of several members of his shadow cabinet had been questioned:\n\n2010 General Election\nThe Conservatives had last won a general election in 1992 The 2010 general election resulted in the Conservatives, led by Cameron, winning the largest number of seats (306) This was, however, 20 seats short of an overall majority, and resulted in the nation's first hung parliament since February 1974.\n\n2010 Government Formation\nTalks between Cameron and then Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg led to an agreed Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition In late 2009 Cameron had urged the Liberal Democrats to join the Conservatives in a new \"national movement\", saying there was \"barely a cigarette paper\" between them on a large number of issues The invitation was rejected at the time by Clegg who said that the Conservatives were totally different from his party, and that the Lib Dems were the true \"progressives\" in UK politics.\n\nPremiership (2010–2016)\nElizabeth II, following Gordon Brown's resignation as prime minister on 11 May 2010, extended an invitation to Cameron to establish a new administration based on Brown's recommendation At age 43, Cameron became the youngest prime minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812, beating the record previously set by Tony Blair in May 1997 In his first address outside 10 Downing Street, he announced his intention to form a coalition government, the first since the Second World War, with the Liberal Democrats.\n\nEconomy\nIn response to the Great Recession, Cameron undertook the austerity programme This was a deficit reduction programme consisting of sustained reductions in public spending, intended to reduce the government budget deficit and the welfare state in the United Kingdom The National Health Service [142] and education [143] were \"ringfenced\" and protected from direct spending cuts [144] Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne claimed they aimed to eliminate the structural deficit (i.e deficit on current spending as opposed to investment), and to have government debt falling as a percentage of GDP [145] By 2015 the deficit as a percentage of GDP had reduced to half what it was in 2010 [145].\n\nImmigration\nCameron said immigration from outside the EU should be subject to annual limits He said in July 2013 that \"in the last decade we have had an immigration policy that's completely lax The pressure it puts on our public services and communities is too great.\" [146] In 2015 The Independent reported: \"The Conservatives have failed spectacularly to deliver their pledge to reduce net migration to less than 100,000 a year The Office for National Statistics (ONS) announced a net flow of 298,000 migrants to the UK in the 12 months to September 2014—up from 210,000 in the previous year.\" [147].\n\nDefence and Foreign Affairs\nIn 2014 Cameron dismissed warnings that his cuts to the UK defence budget had left it less than a \"first class-player in terms of defence\" and no longer a \"full partner\" to the United States [148].\n\nNATO Military Intervention in Libya\nCameron condemned the violence used against anti-Gaddafi protesters at the beginning of the Libyan Civil War [150] After weeks of lobbying by the UK and its allies, on 17 March 2011, the United Nations Security Council approved a no-fly zone to prevent government forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi from carrying out air attacks on anti-Gaddafi rebels [151] Two days later, the UK and the United States fired more than 110 Tomahawk missiles at targets in Libya [152].\n\nFalkland Islands\nIn 2013 in response to Argentina's calls for negotiations over the Falkland Islands' sovereignty, a referendum was called, asking Falkland Islanders whether they supported the continuation of their status as an Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom With a turnout of 91.94%, an overwhelming 99.8% voted to remain a British territory, with only three votes against [162] In light of this, Cameron said: \"We believe in the Falkland islanders' right to self-determination They had a referendum They couldn't have been more clear about wanting to remain with our country and we should protect and defend them\"

class almost two years early [12] At the age of 13, he went on to Eton College in Berkshire, following his father and elder brother [13] His early interest was in art Six weeks before taking his O levels, he was caught smoking cannabis [14] He admitted the offence and had not been involved in selling drugs, so he was not expelled; instead he was fined, prevented from leaving the school grounds and given a \"Georgic\" (a punishment that involved copying 500 lines of Latin text) [15]\n\n\nEarly political career\nAfter graduation, Cameron worked for the Conservative Research Department between September 1988 and 1993 His first brief was Trade and Industry, Energy and Privatisation; he befriended fellow young colleagues, including Edward Llewellyn, Ed Vaizey and Rachel Whetstone They and others formed a group they called the \"Smith Square set\", which was dubbed the \"Brat Pack\" by the press, though it is better known as the \"Notting Hill set\", a name given to it pejoratively by Derek Conway [29] In 1991 Cameron was seconded to Downing Street to work on briefing John Major for the then twice-weekly sessions of Prime Minister's Questions One newspaper gave Cameron the credit

It's time to return to our tax-cutting agenda The socialist prime ministers of Europe have endorsed Tony Blair because they want a federal pussy cat and not a British lion.\" [60]\n\n\nParliamentary backbencher\nUpon his election to Parliament, Cameron served as a member of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, a prominent appointment for a newly elected MP He proposed that the Committee launch an inquiry into the law on drugs, [72] and urged the consideration of \"radical options\" [73] The report recommended a downgrading of ecstasy from Class A to Class B, as well as moves towards a policy of 'harm reduction', which Cameron defended [74]\n\n\nParliamentary frontbencher\nIn June 2003 Cameron was appointed a shadow minister in the Privy Council Office as a deputy to Eric Forth, then shadow leader of the House He also became a vice-chairman of the Conservative Party when Michael Howard took over the leadership in November of that year He was appointed Opposition frontbench

chancellor George Osborne, shadow defence secretary and deputy leader of the party Michael Ancram, Oliver Letwin [85] and former party leader William Hague [86] His campaign did not gain wide support until his speech, delivered without notes, at the 2005 Conservative party conference In the speech, he vowed to make people \"feel good about being Conservatives again\" and said he wanted \"to switch on a whole new generation.\" [87] His speech was well-received; The Daily Telegraph said speaking without notes \"showed a sureness and a confidence that is greatly to his credit\"

Leader\nCameron's relative youth and inexperience before becoming leader invited satirical comparison with Tony Blair Private Eye soon published a picture of both leaders on its front cover, with the caption \"World's first face transplant a success\" [93] On the left, the New Statesman unfavourably likened his \"new style of politics\" to Tony Blair's early leadership years [94] Cameron was accused of paying excessive attention to appearance: ITV News broadcast footage from the 2006 Conservative Party Conference in Bournemouth showing him wearing four different sets of clothes within a few hours [95] In his column for The Guardian, comedy writer and broadcaster Charlie Brooker described the Conservative leader as \"a hollow Easter egg with no bag of sweets inside\" in April 2007 [96]\n\n\nAllegations of recreational drug use\nDuring the leadership election, allegations were made that Cameron had used cannabis and cocaine recreationally before becoming an MP [105] Pressed on this point during the BBC television programme Question Time, Cameron expressed the view that everybody was allowed to \"err and stray\" in their past [106] During his 2005 Conservative leadership campaign, he addressed the question of drug consumption by remarking: \"I did lots of things before I came into politics which I shouldn't have done We all did.\" [106]\n\n\nShadow Cabinet appointments\nHis Shadow Cabinet appointments included MPs associated with the various wings of the party Former leader William Hague was appointed to the foreign affairs brief, while both George Osborne and David Davis were retained, as shadow chancellor of the Exchequer and Shadow Home Secretary, respectively Hague, assisted by Davis, stood in for Cameron during his paternity leave in February 2006 [107] In June 2008 Davis announced his intention to resign as an MP, and was immediately replaced as shadow home secretary by Dominic Grieve; Davis' surprise move was seen as a challenge to the changes introduced under Cameron's leadership [108]\n\n\nEuropean Conservatives and Reformists\nDuring his successful 2005 campaign to be elected leader of the Conservative Party, Cameron pledged that the Conservative Party's members of the European Parliament would leave the European People's Party group, which had a \"federalist\" approach to the European Union [110] Once elected, Cameron began discussions with right-wing and Eurosceptic parties in other European countries, mainly in eastern Europe; in July 2006, he concluded an agreement to form the Movement for European Reform with the Czech Civic Democratic Party, leading to the formation of a new European Parliament group, the European Conservatives and Reformists, in 2009 after the European Parliament elections [111]\nCameron attended a gathering at Warsaw's Palladium cinema celebrating the foundation of the alliance [112]\n\n\nShortlists for Parliamentary candidates\nSimilarly, Cameron's initial \"A-List\" of prospective parliamentary candidates was attacked by members of his party, [114] and the policy was discontinued in favour of gender-balanced final shortlists Before being discontinued, the policy had been criticised by senior Conservative MP and former Prisons Spokeswoman Ann Widdecombe as an \"insult to women\", and she had accused Cameron of \"storing up huge problems for the future.\" [115]\n\n\nSouth Africa\nIn April 2009 The Independent reported that in 1989, while Nelson Mandela remained imprisoned under the apartheid regime, Cameron had accepted a trip to South Africa paid for by an anti-sanctions lobby firm A spokesperson for him responded by saying that the Conservative Party was at that time opposed to sanctions against South Africa and that his trip was a fact-finding mission However, the newspaper reported that Cameron's then superior at Conservative Research Department called the trip \"jolly\", saying that \"it was all terribly relaxed, just a little treat, a perk of the job The Botha regime was attempting to make itself look less horrible, but I don't regard it as having been of the faintest political consequence.\" Cameron distanced himself from his party's history of opposing sanctions against the regime He was criticised by Labour MP Peter Hain, himself an anti-apartheid campaigner [116]\n\n\nRaising teaching standards\nAt the launch of the Conservative Party's education manifesto in January 2010, Cameron declared an admiration for the \"brazenly elite\" approach to education of countries such as Singapore and South Korea, and expressed a desire to \"elevate the status of teaching in our country\" [117] He suggested the adoption of more stringent criteria for entry to teaching, and offered repayment of the loans of maths and science graduates obtaining first or 2.1 degrees from \"good\" universities [118]\n\n\nExpenses\n\nDuring the parliamentary expenses scandal in 2009 Cameron said he would lead Conservatives in repaying \"excessive\" expenses and threatened to expel MPs that refused, after the expense claims of several members of his shadow cabinet had been questioned:\n\n2010 general election\nThe Conservatives had last won a general election in 1992 The 2010 general election resulted in the Conservatives, led by Cameron, winning the largest number of seats (306) This was, however, 20 seats short of an overall majority, and resulted in the nation's first hung parliament since February 1974 [125]\n\n\n2010 government formation\nTalks between Cameron and then Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg led to an agreed Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition In late 2009 Cameron had urged the Liberal Democrats to join the Conservatives in a new \"national movement\", saying there was \"barely a cigarette paper\" between them on a large number of issues The invitation was rejected at the time by Clegg who said that the Conservatives were totally different from his party, and that the Lib Dems were the true \"progressives\" in UK politics [126]\n\n\nPremiership (2010–2016)\nElizabeth II, following Gordon Brown's resignation as prime minister on 11 May 2010, extended an invitation to Cameron to establish a new administration based on Brown's recommendation [127] At age 43, Cameron became the youngest prime minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812, beating the record previously set by Tony Blair in May 1997 [128] In his first address outside 10 Downing Street, he announced his intention to form a coalition government, the first since the Second World War, with the Liberal Democrats [129]\n\n\nEconomy\nIn response to the Great Recession, Cameron undertook the austerity programme This was a deficit reduction programme consisting of sustained reductions in public spending, intended to reduce the government budget deficit and the welfare state in the United Kingdom The National Health Service [142] and education [143] were \"ringfenced\" and protected from direct spending cuts [144] Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne claimed they aimed to eliminate the structural deficit (i.e deficit on current spending as opposed to investment), and to have government debt falling as a percentage of GDP [145] By 2015 the deficit as a percentage of GDP had reduced to half what it was in 2010 [145]\n\n\nImmigration\nCameron said immigration from outside the EU should be subject to annual limits He said in July 2013 that \"in the last decade we have had an immigration policy that's completely lax The pressure it puts on our public services and communities is too great.\" [146] In 2015 The Independent reported: \"The Conservatives have failed spectacularly to deliver their pledge to reduce net migration to less than 100,000 a year The Office for National Statistics (ONS) announced a net flow of 298,000 migrants to the UK in the 12 months to September 2014—up from 210,000 in the previous year.\" [147]\n\n\nDefence and foreign affairs\nIn 2014 Cameron dismissed warnings that his cuts to the UK defence budget had left it less than a \"first class-player in terms of defence\" and no longer a \"full partner\" to the United States [148]\n\n\nDefence cuts\nIn 2014 Cameron dismissed warnings that his cuts to the UK defence budget had left it less than a \"first class-player in terms of defence\" and no longer a \"full partner\" to the United States [148]\n\n\nNATO military intervention in Libya\nCameron condemned the violence used against anti-Gaddafi protesters at the beginning of the Libyan Civil War [150] After weeks of lobbying by the UK and its allies, on 17 March 2011, the United Nations Security Council approved a no-fly zone to prevent government forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi from carrying out air attacks on anti-Gaddafi rebels [151] Two days later, the UK and the United States fired more than 110 Tomahawk missiles at targets in Libya [152]\n\n\nFalklands\nIn 2013 in response to Argentina's calls for negotiations over the Falkland Islands' sovereignty, a referendum was called, asking Falkland Islanders whether they supported the continuation of their status as an Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom With a turnout of 91.94%, an overwhelming 99.8% voted to remain a British territory, with only three votes against [162] In light of this, Cameron said: \"We believe in the Falkland islanders' right to self-determination They had a referendum They couldn't have been more clear about wanting to remain with our country and we should protect and defend them\" [163]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia\nCameron supported Britain's close relationship with Saudi Arabia [164] In January 2015 he travelled to the Saudi capital Riyadh to pay his respects, following the death of the nation's King Abdullah According to WikiLeaks, Cameron initiated a secret deal with Saudi Arabia, ensuring both countries were elected onto the UN Human Rights Council [165] The same year his government announced \"firm political support\" for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against the Shi'a Houthis, [166] re-supplying the Saudi military with weapons and providing them with training [167] [168] [169]\n\n\nSri Lanka\nCameron reiterated calls for an independent investigation into the alleged war crimes during the final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War [170] \"There needs to be proper inquiries into what happened at the end of the war, there needs to be proper human rights, democracy for the Tamil minority in that country\" Cameron stated [171] [172] He stated that, if this investigation was not completed by March 2014, he would press for an independent international inquiry [173] [174] [175] This followed a visit to Jaffna, a war-ravaged town in the northern part of Sri Lanka; Cameron was the first foreign leader to visit Jaffna since the island once colonised by Britain became independent in 1948 [176] [177] Cameron was mobbed by demonstrators, mostly women, seeking his assistance in tracing missing relatives [178] [179]\n\n\nTurkey\nIn a speech in Ankara in July 2010, Cameron stated unequivocally his support for Turkey's accession to the EU, citing economic, security and political considerations, and claimed that those who opposed Turkish membership were driven by \"protectionism, narrow nationalism or prejudice\" [180] [181] In that speech, he was also critical of Israeli action during the Gaza flotilla raid and its Gaza policy, and repeated his opinion that Israel had turned Gaza into a \"prison camp\", [180] having previously referred to Gaza as \"a giant open prison\" [182] These views were met with mixed reactions [183] [184] The Cameron government declined to formally recognise the Ottoman Empire's massacres of Armenians as a \"genocide\" [185]\n\n\nIsrael\nIn January 2024, Cameron dismissed South Africa's ICJ genocide case against Israel as \"nonsense\", saying that Israel is \"a democracy, a country with the rule of law, a country with armed forces that are committed to obeying the rule of law\" [271]\n\n\nMilitary intervention in Iraq and Syria\nIn August 2013 Cameron lost a motion in favour of bombing Syrian armed forces in response to the Ghouta chemical attack, becoming the first prime minister to suffer such a foreign-policy defeat since 1782 [195] In September 2014, MPs passed a motion in favour of British planes joining, at the request of the Iraqi government, a bombing campaign against Islamic State (IS) targets in Iraq; [196] the motion explicitly expressed parliament's disapproval of UK military action in Syria [197] Cameron promised that, before expanding UK air strikes and ground support to include IS units in Syria, he would seek parliamentary approval [198]\n\n\n2015 general election\nCameron was re-elected UK prime minister on 7 May 2015 with a majority in the Commons [209] The Conservative Party's decisive victory in the general election was a surprise, as most polls and commentators had suggested the outcome was too close to call and that the result would be a second hung parliament [210] Cameron said of his first term when returned as prime minister for a second term that he was \"proud to lead the first coalition government in 70 years\" and offered particular thanks to Clegg for his role in it [211] Forming the first Conservative majority government elected since 1992, David Cameron became the first prime minister to be re-elected immediately after a full term with a larger popular vote share since Lord Salisbury at the 1900 general election.\n\n\n2016 referendum and resignation\nAs promised in the election manifesto, Cameron set a date for a referendum on whether the UK should remain a member of the European Union, and announced that he would be campaigning for Britain to remain within a \"reformed EU\" [214] The terms of the UK's membership of the EU were re-negotiated, with agreement reached in February 2016 [215] The option to leave came to be known as Brexit (a portmanteau of \"British\" and \"exit\").\n\n\nPost-premiership (2016–present)\nIn October 2016 Cameron became chairman of the National Citizen Service Patrons [232] In January 2017, he was appointed president of

funding to tackle the condition [233]\n\n\nBrexit\nCameron maintained a low profile following his resignation as prime minister and the subsequent Brexit negotiations In January 2019, following May's defeat in the House of Commons over her draft withdrawal agreement, Cameron gave a rare interview to reporters outside his house in Notting Hill, saying he backed May's Brexit deal with the EU and did not regret calling the 2016 referendum [237] However, he later said that the outcome of the referendum had left him \"hugely depressed\", and told The Times he knew \"some people will never forgive me\" He confessed: \"Every single day I think about it, and the fact that we lost, and the consequences, and the things that could have been done differently, and I worry desperately\" [238]\n\n\nMemoir\nCameron published a memoir, For the Record, on 19 September 2019 through HarperCollins [240] He was reported to have signed an £800,000 contract for the book [241] According to the Guardian, the book was initially scheduled for 2018, but was delayed so Cameron would not be perceived as a \"backstreet driver\" in the ongoing Brexit negotiations [240] [242] The book gives an insight into his life at 10 Downing Street, as well as inside explanations of the decisions taken by his government Cameron said that his aim in writing the book was to \"correct the record\" where he thought it was wrong [243]\n\n\nGreensill scandal\nDuring Cameron's premiership, the financier Lex Greensill was an unpaid advisor who had access to eleven government departments [244] In 2018 he

Suella Braverman's policies against illegal immigration into the UK, arguing in an interview with LBC: \"I think if you don't have a better answer to the things that the government is doing to try and stop this illegal trade, then I think there's no point criticising.\" [259] [260]\n\n\nCOVID-19 Inquiry\nCameron gave evidence to the UK COVID-19 Inquiry on 19 June 2023 [261]\n\n\nForeign Secretary (2023–2024)\nIn Rishi Sunak's cabinet reshuffle on 13 November 2023, Cameron was appointed Foreign Secretary, replacing James Cleverly, who became Home Secretary It was also announced simultaneously that he would receive a life peerage, thus making Cameron a member of the House of Lords and the first former prime minister to be raised to the peerage since Margaret Thatcher [262] He was created

of a need for a new style of politics, saying that he was \"fed up with the Punch and Judy politics of Westminster\" [287] He was \"certainly a big Thatcher fan, but I don't know whether that makes me a Thatcherite\", [288] saying he was a \"liberal Conservative\", though \"not a deeply ideological person.\" [289] As leader of the opposition, Cameron asserted that he did not intend to oppose the government as a matter of course, and would offer his support in areas of agreement He has urged politicians to concentrate more on improving people's happiness and \"general well-being\", instead of focusing solely on \"financial wealth\" [290] There were claims that he described himself to journalists at a dinner during the leadership contest as the \"heir to Blair\" [291]\n\n\nSelf-description

central to improving child well-being\" [301] In 2015 Polly Toynbee questioned Cameron's commitment to tackling poverty, contrasting his earlier statements agreeing that \"poverty is relative\" with proposals to change the government's poverty measure, and saying that cuts in child tax credits would increase child poverty among low-paid working families [302] Cameron denied that austerity had contributed to the 2011 England riots, instead blaming street gangs and opportunistic looters [303]\n\n\nPoverty\nIn 2006 Cameron described poverty as a \"moral disgrace\" [299] and promised to tackle

homosexuality in our schools\" by repealing the anti-gay Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988 [305] Cameron is recorded by Hansard as having voted against same-sex adoption rights in 2002, but he denies this, claiming he abstained from the three-line whip imposed on him by his party In 2008, he wanted lesbians who receive IVF treatment to be required to name a father figure, which received

Conservative MP Christopher Chope to extend civil partnership rights to heterosexual couples, saying: \"I think we should be promoting marriage rather than looking at any other way of weakening it.\" [313] In 2018 the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that this position was discriminatory [314]\n\n\nComments on other parties and politicians\nCameron criticised Gordon Brown (when Brown was Chancellor of the Exchequer) for being \"an analogue politician in a digital age\" and referred to him as \"the roadblock to reform\" [315] As prime minister, he reacted to press reports that Brown could be the next head of the International Monetary Fund by hinting that he may block the appointment, citing the huge national debt that Brown left the country with as a reason for Brown not being suitable for the role [316]\n\n\nForeign affairs\nIn an interview on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross in 2006, Cameron said that he supported the decision of the then Labour Government to go to war in Iraq, and said that he thought supporters should \"see it through\" [326] He also supported a motion brought by the SNP and Plaid Cymru in 2006, calling for an inquiry into the government's conduct of the Iraq war In 2011 he oversaw the withdrawal of British soldiers from Iraq He repeatedly called for the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq war to conclude and publish its findings, saying: \"People want to know the truth\" [327]\n\n\nIraq War\nIn an interview on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross in 2006, Cameron said that he supported the decision of the then Labour Government to go to war in Iraq, and said that he thought supporters should \"see it through\" [326] He also supported a motion brought by the SNP and Plaid Cymru in 2006, calling for an inquiry into the government's conduct of the Iraq war In 2011 he oversaw the withdrawal of British soldiers from Iraq He repeatedly called for the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq war to conclude and publish its findings, saying: \"People want to know the truth\" [327]\n\n\nIndia\nCameron was a strong advocate of increased ties between India and the United Kingdom, describing Indian–British relations as the \"New Special Relationship\" in 2010 [328] [329]\n\n\nIsrael\nIn January 2024, Cameron dismissed South Africa's ICJ genocide case against Israel as \"nonsense\", saying that Israel is \"a democracy, a country with the rule of law, a country with armed forces that are committed to obeying the rule of law\" [271]\n\n\nChina\nIn October 2015 Xi Jinping, the president of the People's Republic of China, paid a state visit to the United Kingdom under the Premiership of Cameron Such episodes including the Chinese leader famously having a pint with Cameron at a local pub in Buckinghamshire, [334] and Queen Elizabeth hailing the visit as \"milestone\" during state banquet, [335] symbolised the increased cordiality between China and the United Kingdom under Cameron, in spite of the controversies around the state visit and the concerns with China's superpower status The state visit was the third formal Anglo–Chinese diplomatic meetings, which involves either head of states or head of governments, following Cameron's visit to China in 2013 and then–Premier Li Keqiang's UK visit in 2014; the year 2015 alone also marked an unprecedented level of bilateral meetings and visits [336]\n\n\nRussia\nIn the years after Cameron became UK prime minister, UK relations with Russia initially showed a marked improvement In 2011 Cameron visited Russia, and in 2012, Putin visited the UK for the first time in seven years, holding talks with Cameron, and also visiting the 2012 London Olympics together [341]\n\n\nPolitical image\nIn April 2016 then Labour MP for Bolsover, Dennis Skinner was reprimanded by House Speaker John Bercow for referring to Cameron as 'Dodgy Dave' (related to Skinner's contention of Cameron's dishonesty) in a parliamentary debate about the Panama Papers Skinner was instructed by Bercow to repeat his question without referring to Cameron using the adjective 'dodgy' When Skinner repeated his question, once again referring to Cameron as 'Dodgy Dave', he was ordered to leave parliament for the remainder of that day's session [345] [346] In July 2016, Skinner once again referred to Cameron as 'Dodgy Dave' in parliament, however this time he was not reprimanded, or asked to leave [347]\n\n\n\"Dodgy Dave\" moniker\nIn April 2016 then Labour MP for Bolsover, Dennis Skinner was reprimanded by House Speaker John Bercow for referring to Cameron as 'Dodgy Dave' (related to Skinner's contention of Cameron's dishonesty) in a parliamentary debate about the Panama Papers Skinner was instructed by Bercow to repeat his question without referring to Cameron using the adjective 'dodgy' When Skinner repeated his question, once again referring to Cameron as 'Dodgy Dave', he was ordered to leave parliament for the remainder of that day's session [345] [346] In July 2016, Skinner once again referred to Cameron as 'Dodgy Dave' in parliament, however this time he was not reprimanded, or asked to leave [347]\n\n\nAllegations of social elitism\nAs leader of the Conservative Party, Cameron was accused of relying on \"old-boy networks\", and criticised by his party for the imposition of selective shortlists of women and ethnic minority prospective parliamentary candidates [353] [114] Several of Cameron's senior appointments, such as George Osborne as chancellor of the Exchequer, are former members of the Bullingdon Club Michael Gove conceded it was \"ridiculous\" how many fellow Cabinet ministers were old Etonians, though he placed the blame on the failings of the state education system rather than Cameron [354] However, Michael Mosbacher, co-founder of Standpoint, wrote that Cameron's cabinet has the lowest number of Etonians of any past Conservative government: \"David Cameron's government is the least patrician, least wealthy and least public-school-educated—indeed the least Etonian Conservative-led government this country has ever seen\" [355]\n\n\nPlots against leadership\nFollowing poor results in the May 2012 local elections after a difficult few months for the government, with Labour increasing its lead in the polls, there were concerns from Conservative MPs about Cameron's leadership and his electability David Davies, the chairman of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee, accused the Conservative leadership of \"incompetence\", and hinted that it could risk Cameron's leadership [356] Nadine Dorries warned the Prime Minister that a leadership challenge could happen [357]\n\n\nCameron and Andy Coulson\nIn 2007 Cameron appointed Andy Coulson, former editor of the News of the World, as his director of communications Coulson had resigned as the paper's editor following the conviction of a reporter in relation to illegal phone hacking, although stating that he knew nothing about it [360] [361] In June 2010, Downing Street confirmed Coulson's annual salary as £140,000, the highest pay of any special adviser to UK Government [362]\n\n\nCameron and Michael Ashcroft\nAlthough Lord Michael Ashcroft played a significant role in the 2010 election, he was not offered a ministerial post [368] In June 2012, shortly before a major Conservative rebellion on House of Lords reform, [369] journalist Peter Oborne credited Ashcroft with \"stopping the Coalition working\" by moving policy on Europe, welfare, education and taxation to the right [368] According to Oborne, Ashcroft, owner of both the ConservativeHome and PoliticsHome websites and a \"brutal critic of the Coalition from the start\", had established \"megaphone presence\" in the on-line media He believes Cameron's philosophy of liberal conservatism has been destroyed by \"coordinated attacks on the Coalition\" and \"the two parties are no longer trying to pretend that they are governing together.\" [368]\n\n\nStanding in opinion polls\nAn ICM poll in September 2007 saw Cameron rated the least popular of the three main party leaders [378] [379] A YouGov poll on party leaders conducted on 9–10 June 2011 found 44% of the electorate thought he was doing well and 50% thought he was doing badly, while 38% thought he would be the best PM and 35% did not know [380] In the run up to the 2015 election, Cameron achieved his first net positive approval rating in four years, with a YouGov poll finding 47% of voters thought he was doing well as prime minister compared with 46% who thought he was doing badly [381]\n\n\nEvaluations of premiership\nIn the months immediately following his resignation from the post of prime minister, a number of commentators gave negative evaluations of Cameron's premiership The University of Leeds' 2016 survey of post-war prime ministers, which collected the views of 82 academics specialising in the history and politics of post-war Britain, ranked Cameron as the third-worst prime minister since 1945, ranking above only Alec Douglas-Home and Anthony Eden 90% of respondents cited his calling and losing of the Brexit referendum as his greatest failure [385]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nCameron made a cameo appearance in the BBC television programme Top Gear's India Special, where he tells the trio of Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond to \"stay away from India\" after initially denying the group's request to improve economic relations with India in a letter and suggested that they mend fences with Mexico He later stated through his aides that he did not like the special that he cameoed in, and that he had the \"utmost respect\" for the people of India [386] Cameron was portrayed by comedian Jon Culshaw in ITV's satirical sketch show Newzoids, [387] and by Mark Dexter in the Channel 4 television films Coalition and Brexit: The Uncivil War In 2019 he was interviewed for The Cameron Years, a BBC mini-documentary series on his premiership [388]\n\n\nPersonal life\nCameron married Samantha Sheffield, the daughter of Sir Reginald Sheffield, 8th Baronet, and Annabel Lucy Veronica Jones (later Viscountess Astor) in 1996 [394] They have had four children Their first child, Ivan Reginald Ian, was born on 8 April 2002 in Hammersmith and Fulham, London, with a rare combination of cerebral palsy and a form of severe epilepsy called Ohtahara syndrome, requiring round-the-clock care Recalling the receipt of this news, Cameron was quoted as saying: \"The news hits you like a freight train .. You are depressed for a while because you are grieving for the difference between your hopes and the reality But then you get over that, because he's wonderful.\" [395] Ivan was cared for at the specialist NHS Cheyne Day Centre in West London, which closed shortly after he left it Ivan died at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London, on 25 February 2009, aged six [396]\n\n\nFamily\nCameron married Samantha Sheffield, the daughter of Sir Reginald Sheffield, 8th Baronet, and Annabel Lucy Veronica Jones (later Viscountess Astor) in 1996 [394] They have had four children Their first child, Ivan Reginald Ian, was born on 8 April 2002 in Hammersmith and Fulham, London, with a rare combination of cerebral palsy and a form of severe epilepsy called Ohtahara syndrome, requiring round-the-clock care Recalling the receipt of this news, Cameron was quoted as saying: \"The news hits you like a freight train ..

The protests were organized by the group Insulate Britain, which is a splinter faction of the global environmental movement Extinction Rebellion. The group's primary objective was to raise awareness about the need to insulate homes in the UK to reduce energy consumption and lower carbon emissions.\n\n## Background\n\nInsulate Britain was founded by six members of Extinction Rebellion in 2021. The group's methods differ slightly from those of Extinction Rebellion, but they share the same overall target: to reduce the rate of climate change. Insulate Britain's approach focuses on the importance of insulating homes to reduce energy consumption and lower carbon emissions. The group began hosting both online and in-person events in July 2021, also raising money for direct action. They use civil disobedience as a tactic to draw attention to their cause.\n\n## Protests\n\nThe Insulate Britain protests began on 13 September 2021, when protesters sat in roads at five junctions (Junctions 3, 6, 14, 20, and 31) on the M25 motorway. The protests were designed to disrupt traffic and draw attention to the group's cause. The protesters used various tactics, including blocking roads, lying down, and holding signs. The protests were well-organized, with protesters using social media to coordinate their actions and share information.\n\nThe protests continued on 15, 17, 20, 21, and 23 September, with protesters targeting different locations on the M25. The protests were met with a strong police presence, with officers using various tactics to try and disperse the protesters. However, the protesters remained determined, and the protests continued for several days.\n\n## Aftermath\n\nOn 7 February 2022, the group self-declared \"with a heavy heart\" that the series of protests had failed in their aim to force the government into taking action. The group acknowledged that the protests had not achieved their desired outcome, but they expressed hope that their actions had raised awareness about the importance of insulating homes.\n\n## Reaction\n\nThe Insulate Britain protests sparked a strong reaction from the government and the public. The National Highways organization was granted an injunction that prohibited demonstrators from causing damage to the surface of or to any apparatus on or around the M25. The injunction was effective from 22 September 2021 and lasted until 21 March 2022. Protesters who broke the injunction were at risk of being in contempt of court, which could result in a prison sentence of up to two years or an unlimited fine.\n\nHowever, Insulate Britain figures told The Guardian that they believed an injunction, prosecutions, and other legal actions were being delayed by the government until after the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26). A spokesperson said: \"We know that our government and institutions purport that we live in a democracy, so they don't want to have 50-100 climate protesters on remand when [the conference] starts.\"\n\nOn 17 November 2021, nine protesters were imprisoned: one for six months, six for four months, and one for three months. Emma Smart, one of the protesters imprisoned, started a hunger strike after sentencing and was moved to the hospital wing of HMP Bronzefield on the 13th day of her strike.\n\n## See also\n\n* Extinction Rebellion\n* Climate change\n* Insulation\n* Energy consumption\n* Carbon emissions\n* Civil disobedience\n* Protests\n\n## External links\n\n* Insulate Britain website\n* Extinction Rebellion website\n* National Highways website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Insulate_Britain_protests\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nInsulate Britain is an environmental activist group, founded by six members [5] of the global environmental movement Extinction Rebellion [6] Their methods slightly differ from that of Extinction Rebellion, but they share the same overall target: to reduce the rate of climate change The group began hosting both online and in-person events in July 2021, also raising money for direct action [6] They use civil disobedience as a tactic [7] [8]\n\n\nProtests\nThe protests began on 13 September 2021, when protesters sat in roads at five junctions (Junctions 3, 6, 14, 20 and 31) on the M25 motorway, [6] [10] followed by further protests on 15, [11] 17, [12] 20, [13] 21 [14] and 23 [15] September \n\n\nAftermath\nOn 7 February 2022 the group self-declared \"with a heavy heart\" that the series of protests had failed in their aim to force the government into taking action [30]\n\n\nReaction\nAn injunction effective on 22 September 2021 and lasting to 21 March 2022 was granted to National Highways [34] [35] [36] The injunction prohibited demonstrators from \"causing damage to the surface of or to any apparatus on or around the M25 including but not limited to painting, damaging by fire, or affixing any item or structure thereto\" [37] Protesters who break the injunction will be in contempt of court, which could result in a prison sentence of up to two years or an unlimited fine [38] However, Insulate Britain figures told The Guardian that they believed an injunction, prosecutions and other legal actions were being delayed by the government until after 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) A spokesperson said: \"We know that our government and institutions purport that we live in a democracy, so they don't want to have 50–100 climate protesters on remand when  [the conference] starts\" [39] On 17 November 2021, nine protesters were imprisoned: one for six months, six for four months and one for three months [3] Emma Smart, one of the protestors imprisoned, started a hunger strike after sentencing and was moved to the hospital wing of HMP Bronzefield on the 13th day of her strike [40]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Her novels often explored themes of love, sex, and relationships, and were known for their frank and explicit content. Collins's writing career spanned over five decades, during which she published over 30 novels and numerous non-fiction books. Her work has been translated into over 40 languages and has sold over 500 million copies worldwide.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJackie Collins was born in 1937 in Hampstead, London, to a family of modest means. Her father, Joseph William Collins, was a theatrical agent who represented several notable clients, including Dame Shirley Bassey, the Beatles, and Sir Tom Jones. Collins's mother, Elsa (née Bessant) Collins, was a homemaker who also worked as a secretary.\n\nCollins's early life was marked by a love of reading and writing. She began writing stories and poems at the age of 13, and by the time she was in her early teens, she was writing explicit sex scenes that classmates would pay to read. Despite her early talent, Collins's family did not encourage her to pursue a writing career, and she instead attended a secretarial college in London.\n\n**Early Career**\n\nIn 1956, Collins visited her older sister, Joan, who was living in Los Angeles. Although Collins returned to London, she was determined to make a career in the United States. She attempted to gain a work permit to enable her to be groomed for stardom at 20th Century Fox, but was ultimately unsuccessful. Collins began appearing in acting roles in a series of British B-movies, including \"Barnacle Bill\" (1957), \"Rock You Sinners\" (1957), and \"The Safecracker\" (1958).\n\nCollins's early acting career was marked by small roles in television series such as \"Danger Man\" and \"The Saint.\" However, she eventually gave up on pursuing an acting career, although she did make a brief appearance in the television series \"Minder\" in 1980.\n\n**Writing Career**\n\nCollins's writing career began in the 1960s, when she began writing novels while working as a secretary. Her first novel, \"The World Is Full of Married Men,\" was published in 1968 and caused a scandal due to its explicit content. The novel was banned in Australia and South Africa, but its notoriety helped to boost sales in the United States and the UK.\n\nCollins's subsequent novels, including \"The Stud\" (1969) and \"Lady Love\" (1971), also explored themes of love and sex. Her third novel, \"Sunday Simmons & Charlie Brick,\" was published in 1971 and marked her first novel to be set in the United States.\n\nBy the 1980s, Collins was a peer of successful male airport novel authors such as Sidney Sheldon and Harold Robbins. Her novels, including \"Chances\" (1981) and \"Lucky\" (1985), were known for their frank and explicit content, and were often criticized for their portrayal of women and relationships.\n\n**1990s**\n\nIn the 1990s, Collins continued to write and publish novels, including \"Lady Boss\" (1990) and \"Hollywood Husbands\" (1992). She also began to explore the world of television, co-producing and writing several TV movies and series, including \"Lucky Chances\" (1990) and \"L.A.

People named her one of 2012's \"Most Beautiful at Every Age.\" Woodley was also considered one of the 55 faces of the future by Nylon's \"Young Hollywood Issue.\" She also received the Emerging Star Spotlight Award at Elle's 20th Annual \"Women In Hollywood.\"\n\n## 2015-2019: Hiatus and mature roles\n\nIn 2015, Woodley reprised her role as Tris in \"The Divergent Series: Insurgent,\" the second installment in \"The Divergent Series.\" Her performance once again received critical acclaim, with Daniel M. Kimmel of New England Movies Weekly writing, \"Woodley does solid work here as she's done elsewhere, and continues to be someone to watch.\" Despite a more negative critical reception than the previous film, \"Insurgent\" was commercially successful, making nearly $100 million in its worldwide debut and grossing $295.2 million worldwide. She reprised her role again in the penultimate film of the series \"Allegiant\" (2016). The film, however, was poorly reviewed by critics and a box-office bomb. Lionsgate had planned for the final film in the series, named \"Ascendant,\" to be made for television, but Woodley announced that she would not be a part of it. In an interview with MTV, Woodley clarified that she had every intention of doing the final \"Divergent\" installment but she wanted to see its rightful end, and to her, that meant finishing what she, the cast and crew set out to do from the beginning and that is making \"Ascendant\" a full-length feature film. She added, \"I want to do justice to everybody who believes in the character of Tris as much as I believe in the character of Tris.\"\n\n2021-present: Further film and television work\n\nIn 2021, Woodley had a supporting role in Kevin Macdonald's real-life Guantanamo Bay drama film \"The Mauritanian\" alongside Jodie Foster, Tahar Rahim, and Benedict Cumberbatch. She portrayed Teri Duncan, the junior associate of defense lawyer Nancy Hollander (played by Foster). David Ehrlich of IndieWire described Woodley as \"overqualified for a role that requires her to do little more than smile and sweat.\" She had a small role in the critically acclaimed film \"The Fallout.\" The appearance was a dedication to her longtime friendship with the film's director Megan Park, her co-star in \"The Secret Life of the American Teenager.\" She next starred in and executive produced the romantic drama \"The Last Letter from Your Lover\" alongside Felicity Jones, based on the bestselling book by Jojo Moyes. She played Jennifer Stirling, a 1960s married woman caught in an illicit love affair, leading her to discover her place in the society and who she truly loves. Sophie Kaufman of Time Out said, \"Woodley has such raw intensity as a performer that she shows up any tired elements of a film production, just as silk shows up polyester.\"\n\nArtistry and public image\n\nEarlier in her career, she admitted to being uneducated about the film and TV industry, particularly in terms of directors, producers, actors, and good films. According to her, she is drawn to \"human scripts\" which \"are raw, and real, and risky\" with her playing \"vulnerable scary\" characters. She stated, \"I'm such a happy, optimistic person in real life for some reason, I have a great time taking out my alter-ego, dark side on screen.\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, she said, \"I fall in love with human beings based on who they are, not based on what they do or what sex they are.\" In 2018, she confirmed she was dating Australian-Fijian rugby union player Ben Volavola. In April 2020, the relationship with Volavola reportedly ended.\n\nActivism\n\nWoodley is an avid environmental activist and climate advocate. In 2010, she and her mother co-founded the nonprofit organization All it Takes, a youth leadership program that aims to educate young people to practice empathy, compassion, responsibility, and purpose in hopes to foster sustainable, positive change for themselves, others, and the environment. She received the Philanthropy Award at Variety's fourth Annual Power of Youth event for the significant contributions made by All it Takes. She supported and campaigned for Bernie Sanders for president in 2016. Woodley organized the Up to Us movement, a cross-country caravan to the Democratic National Convention. Its goal is to unite Americans, in an act of solidarity, to raise awareness on the political, social, and environmental issues political candidates need to address leading up to the elections.\n\nFilmography\n\n### Film\n\n1.

He was born on April 6, 1975, in South Orange, New Jersey. Braff's early life was marked by a strong conservative/Orthodox Jewish upbringing, with his parents, Harold Irwin \"Hal\" Braff and Anne Hutchinson Maynard, playing a significant role in shaping his identity.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nBraff's father was a trial attorney, professor, and founder of the state's American Inns of Court. His mother was a clinical psychologist who converted to Judaism before marrying Braff's father. Braff's parents divorced and remarried others during his childhood, which likely influenced his perspective on family and relationships. His older brother, Joshua Braff, is an author, and his brother, Adam Braff, is a writer and producer. Braff's stepsister, Jessica Kirson, is a stand-up comedian.\n\nBraff's Jewish heritage has had a lasting impact on his life and career. He has spoken publicly about his experiences as a Jewish person, including his bar mitzvah service at Oheb Shalom Congregation. However, Braff has also expressed his ambivalence towards organized religion, stating that \"the religion (Judaism) doesn't necessarily work for me.\" Despite this, he identifies as Jewish and has maintained strong ties to his community.\n\n**Career**\n\nBraff's acting career began in the late 1980s with a proposed CBS television series, High, which featured a cast that included Gwyneth Paltrow and Craig Ferguson. Although the show never made it to air, Braff's early start in the entertainment industry laid the groundwork for his future success. He appeared in the 1990s series The Baby-sitters Club, in the episode \"Dawn Saves the Trees.\" Braff also appeared in Woody Allen's 1993 film Manhattan Murder Mystery.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Braff had a part in a George C. Wolfe production of Macbeth for New York City's Public Theater. This experience likely influenced his decision to pursue a career in filmmaking. Braff's breakthrough role came in 2004 when he starred in and directed the film Garden State, which was filmed in his home state of New Jersey. Producers were initially reluctant to finance the film, but Braff's dedication and perseverance paid off. The film's soundtrack, which included a mixtape featuring various artists, won a Grammy for Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media.\n\n**Filmmaking**\n\nBraff's experience working on Garden State led to his involvement in several other film projects. He was expected to direct Open Hearts, a remake of the 2002 Danish film Elsker dig for evigt (Love You Forever). The film was about a woman who has an affair with her paralyzed husband's doctor, whose wife caused the accident that put her husband in a wheelchair. However, the project was eventually canceled due to scheduling and budget issues. At the same time, Braff's film The Last Kiss was being released.\n\nBraff's other notable film roles include his cameo appearance in It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie, along with other Scrubs cast members. He has also been involved in several theater productions, including a part in Twelfth Night, staged in Central Park in 2002. In 2010, Braff took on a lead role in Trust, a contemporary Off-Broadway play written by Paul Weitz and directed by Peter DuBois.\n\n**Other Pursuits**\n\nIn addition to his acting career, Braff has pursued other interests, including opening the Mermaid Oyster Bar in New York City with chef and high school friend Laurence Edelman, as well as Danny Abrams, in 2009.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nBraff has been in several high-profile relationships, including with actress Mandy Moore, from 2004 to 2006, and model Taylor Bagley, from 2009 to 2014. He also dated actress Florence Pugh, from 2019 to 2022. Braff directed Pugh in his 2019 short film In the Time it Takes to Get There and the drama film A Good Person.\n\n**Political Views**\n\nBraff has been involved in politics, endorsing the re-election campaign of President Barack Obama in 2012.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* **Film**\n\t+ High (1989)\n\t+ The Baby-sitters Club (1990)\n\t+ Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993)\n\t+ Garden State (2004)\n\t+ The Last Kiss (2006)\n\t+ It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie (2002)\n\t+ A Good Person (2022)\n* **Television**\n\t+ Scrubs (2001-2010)\n\t+ Trust (2010)\n* **Video Games**\n\t+ The Muppets (2011)\n* **Theatre**\n\t+ Twelfth Night (2002)\n\t+ Trust (2010)\n* **Production Work**\n\t+ Garden State (2004)\n\t+ Open Hearts (2006)\n* **Discography**\n\t+ Garden State (2004)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Zach_Braff\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nZachary Israel Braff [4] was born on April 6, 1975 [5] in South Orange, New Jersey, and grew up there and in neighboring Maplewood [6] His father Harold Irwin \"Hal\" Braff (1934–2018) was a trial attorney, [6] professor and alumnus at Rutgers Law School, a founder of the state's American Inns of Court (AIC) and an elected trustee of the National Inns of Court Foundation [7] His mother Anne Hutchinson Maynard worked as a clinical psychologist [8] [9] His parents divorced and remarried others during Braff's childhood [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Braff's father was born into a Jewish family [15] [16] [17] and Braff's mother, originally a Protestant, converted to Judaism before marrying his father [18] [19] Braff said that he had a \"very strong conservative/orthodox  [Jewish] upbringing.\" He had his bar mitzvah service at Oheb Shalom Congregation [20] [11] [21] In 2005, he said that he was \"not a huge organized religion guy,\" [22] and in 2013, he said that \"the religion (Judaism) doesn't necessarily work for me,\" although he identifies as Jewish [23] [24] [25] [26] His older brother is author Joshua Braff His other brother, Adam Braff, is a writer and producer His stepsister, Jessica Kirson, is a stand-up comedian [11]\n\n\nCareer\nOne of Braff's earliest roles was in High, a proposed 1989 CBS television series with a cast that also included Gwyneth Paltrow and Craig Ferguson;

in East Germany, it merged with the Communist Party of Germany to form the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany Under the chairmanship of Kurt Schumacher, the SPD was a socialist party representing the interests of the working class and of trade unions With the 1959 Godesberg Program, the party evolved from a socialist working-class party to a modern social-democratic party working within democratic capitalism The SPD's Hamburg Programme, adopted in 2007, describes democratic socialism as \"the vision of a free and fair society in solidarity\", which requires \"a structure in economy, state and society guaranteeing civil, political, social and economic basic rights for all people living a life without exploitation, suppression and violence, hence in social and human security\", the realization of which is emphasized as a \"permanent task\" Social democracy serves as the \"principle of our actions\" [44]\n\n\nInternal factions\nThe SPD is mostly composed of members belonging to either of the two main wings, namely the Keynesian social democrats and Third Way moderate social democrats belonging to the Seeheimer Kreis While the more moderate Seeheimer Kreis generally support the Agenda 2010 programs introduced by Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, the classical social democrats continue to defend classical left-wing policies and the welfare state The Keynesian left-wing of the SPD claims that in recent years the welfare state has been curtailed through reform programs such as the Agenda 2010, Hartz IV, and the more economic liberal stance of the SPD which were endorsed by centrist social democrats [50] [51] In reaction to Agenda 2010, an inner-party dissident movement developed, leading to the foundation of the new party Labour and Social Justice – The Electoral Alternative (Arbeit & soziale Gerechtigkeit – Die Wahlalternative, WASG) in 2005, which later merged into The Left (Die Linke) in 2007 [52] The Parlamentarische Linke comprises left-wing SPD Members of the German Bundestag.\n\n\nElectorate\nPrior to World War II, as the main non-revolutionary left-wing party, the Social Democrats fared best among non-Catholic workers as well as intellectuals favouring social progressive causes and increased economic equality Led by Kurt Schumacher after World War II, the SPD initially opposed both the social market economy and Konrad Adenauer's drive towards Western integration fiercely; after Schumacher's death, however, it accepted the social market economy and Germany's position in the Western alliance in order to appeal to a broader range of voters It still remains associated with the economic causes of unionised employees and working class voters In the 1990s, the left and moderate wings of the party drifted apart, culminating in a secession of a significant number of party members which later joined the socialist party WASG, which later merged into The Left (Die Linke).\n\n\nSocial structure\nPrior to World War II, as the main non-revolutionary left-wing party, the Social Democrats fared best among non-Catholic workers as well as intellectuals favouring social progressive causes and increased economic equality Led by Kurt Schumacher after World War II, the SPD initially opposed both the social market economy and Konrad Adenauer's drive towards Western integration fiercely;

The party has its origins in the General German Workers' Association, founded in 1863, and the Social Democratic Workers' Party, founded in 1869. The two groups merged in 1875 to create the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany (Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands, SAPD), which later adopted its current name in 1890.\n\n# History\n\nThe Social Democratic Party has a long and complex history, marked by periods of repression and resistance, as well as significant shifts in its ideology and policies. The party's early years were characterized by a strong commitment to Marxist principles and a focus on labor rights and social reform. However, the party's growth and influence were hindered by the Anti-Socialist Laws, which banned any group that aimed at spreading socialist principles, from 1878 to 1890.\n\nDespite these challenges, the SPD continued to gain support and influence in German society. The party's popularity soared in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the SPD becoming the largest Marxist party in Europe and consistently the most popular party in German federal elections from 1890 onward. However, the party's success was often limited by the electoral system, which favored larger parties and coalition governments.\n\n## World War I and the Weimar Republic\n\nDuring World War I, the SPD played a significant role in opposing the war effort and advocating for peace. However, the party's opposition to the war was not uniformly strong, and many SPD members supported the war effort. After the war, the SPD played a key role in shaping the Weimar Republic, Germany's first democratic government.\n\n## Nazi Era and Post-War Period\n\nThe Nazi Party came to power in 1933, and the SPD was banned. Many SPD members were persecuted and killed during the Nazi era. After the war, the SPD was re-formed in West Germany, and the party played a significant role in shaping the country's post-war politics.\n\n## Reunification and Modern Era\n\nIn the 1990s, the SPD played a key role in German reunification, with the party's leader, Willy Brandt, serving as a key mediator in the reunification talks. Since then, the SPD has continued to play a significant role in German politics, with the party serving as a key partner in coalition governments.\n\n# Ideology and Platform\n\nThe SPD's ideology and platform have evolved significantly over the years. The party's early years were marked by a strong commitment to Marxist principles and a focus on labor rights and social reform. However, the party's growth and influence were hindered by the Anti-Socialist Laws, which banned any group that aimed at spreading socialist principles, from 1878 to 1890.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the SPD underwent a major shift in policies, reflected in the differences between the Heidelberg Program of 1925 and the Godesberg Program of 1959. The Heidelberg Program called for the transformation of the capitalist system of private ownership of the means of production to social ownership, while the Godesberg Program aimed to broaden the party's voter base and to move its political position toward the political centre.\n\n## Modern Era\n\nIn the modern era, the SPD has continued to evolve and adapt its policies and ideology. The party's Hamburg Programme, adopted in 2007, describes democratic socialism as \"the vision of a free and fair society in solidarity\", which requires \"a structure in economy, state and society guaranteeing civil, political, social and economic basic rights for all people living a life without exploitation, suppression and violence, hence in social and human security\".\n\n# Internal Factions\n\nThe SPD is composed of members belonging to either of the two main wings, namely the Keynesian social democrats and Third Way moderate social democrats belonging to the Seeheimer Kreis. The Keynesian left-wing of the SPD claims that in recent years the welfare state has been curtailed through reform programs such as the Agenda 2010, Hartz IV, and the more economic liberal stance of the SPD which were endorsed by centrist social democrats.\n\n## Parlamentarische Linke\n\nThe Parlamentarische Linke comprises left-wing SPD Members of the German Bundestag. The parliamentary group was founded in 2005 and has since played a significant role in shaping the party's policies and ideology.\n\n# Electorate\n\nThe SPD has traditionally been associated with the economic causes of unionized employees and working-class voters. However, the party's electorate has evolved over the years, with the party now also attracting support from a broader range of voters.\n\n## Geographic Distribution\n\nMuch of the SPD's current-day support comes from large cities, especially northern and western Germany and Berlin. As of 2019, 10 of the country's 15 biggest cities are led by SPD mayors. The metropolitan Ruhr Area, where coal mining and steel production were once the main industries, have provided a significant base for the SPD in the 20th century.\n\n# Post-War Leadership\n\nThe federal leader is supported by six Deputy Leaders and the party executive. As of 2021, the leaders are Saskia Esken and Norbert Walter-Borjans. The previous leader was Andrea Nahles, who announced her pending resignation on 2 June 2019.\n\n# State-Level\n\nThe SPD, at times called SAPD, took part in general elections determining the composition of parliament. For elections up until 1933, the parliament was called the Reichstag, except for the one of 1919 which was called the National Assembly and since 1949 the parliament is called Bundestag.\n\n## Election Results\n\nThe SPD has consistently been one of the most popular parties in German federal elections, with the party winning a significant share of the vote in most elections.\n\n## Results Timeline\n\nThe SPD has a long history of participating in German federal elections. The party's electoral performance has varied over the years, but the party has consistently been one of the most popular parties in Germany.\n\n# See Also\n\n* German politics\n* Social democracy\n* Labor movement\n* Marxism\n* Anti-Socialist Laws\n* Weimar Republic\n* Nazi Party\n* Post-war Germany\n* Reunification\n* European integration\n\n# Notes\n\n* The SPD's history and ideology are complex and multifaceted, and this article provides only a brief overview.\n* The party's electoral performance has varied over the years, but the party has consistently been one of the most popular parties in Germany.\n* The SPD has played a significant role in shaping German politics and society, and its legacy continues to influence German politics today.\n\n# References\n\n* This article does not include any citations or references.\n* For further reading on the SPD's history and ideology, see:\n\t+ \"The Social Democratic Party of Germany: A History\" by Richard J.

With a career spanning multiple languages and genres, she has established herself as one of the greatest actors of Indian cinema. Born on 23 August 1944 in Mussoorie, Banu comes from a family of artists, with her mother being a prominent actress and her grandniece being a successful film actress.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nSaira Banu was born to actress Naseem Banu and producer Mian Ehsan-ul-Haq. She had one brother, Sultan Ahmed, who was five years older than her. Banu's niece, Shaheen Banu, married actor Sumeet Saigal, and her grandniece, Sayyeshaa, is also a film actress, married to film actor Arya. Banu's family has a rich history in the film industry, and it was only natural that she would follow in their footsteps.\n\n**Career**\n\nBanu started her career in the film industry at the age of 16, in 1960, when she made her debut in Hindi films. She has said in interviews that she had basic talent and little dancing experience, but she quickly trained herself professionally in Kathak and Bharata Natyam. This training helped her to become a skilled dancer, and her films featured more of her dancing as she progressed in her career.\n\nBanu's early years in the industry were marked by her association with top-notch filmmakers and actors. She worked with directors like K. Asif and Guru Dutt, and actors like Dilip Kumar and Raj Kapoor. Her performances in films like \"Junglee\" and \"Mere Mehboob\" showcased her talent and versatility as an actress.\n\nAs Banu's career progressed, she became known for her ability to portray complex characters with ease. She was often typecast as a romantic lead, but she was determined to break free from this mold and experiment with different roles. Her performances in films like \"Aakhri Dao\" and \"Aadmi\" demonstrated her range as an actress and her willingness to take on challenging roles.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nBanu married actor Dilip Kumar on 11 October 1966, when she was just 22 years old, and Kumar was 44 years old. They did not have any children, and in his autobiography, Dilip Kumar: The Substance and the Shadow, he revealed that Banu had conceived in 1972, but developed complications in the pregnancy, leading to a miscarriage. Following this, they did not try to have children again, believing it to be God's will.\n\nBanu and Kumar lived in Bandra, a suburb of Mumbai, and their marriage was marked by a deep understanding and respect for each other. Banu has said in interviews that she was deeply influenced by Kumar's values and principles, and she credits him for being a constant source of support and inspiration in her life.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nSaira Banu is regarded as one of the greatest actors of Indian cinema. In 2022, she was placed in Outlook India's \"75 Best Bollywood Actresses\" list. She was also placed 9th in Rediff.com's \"Best Bollywood Debut Ever\" list, for her film Junglee. She was also placed in Times of India's \"50 Beautiful Faces\" list.

this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nAustralia were first awarded the tournament in February 2015, with New Zealand expected to co-host It would have been the first time that Australia would host the ICC World Twenty20 The tournament was provisionally scheduled to be held from 18 October to 15 November 2020 [13] [14] [15]  Prior to the 2018 ICC Women's World Twenty20 final, the ICC announced that the men's and women's World Twenty20 would be rebranded as the \"ICC T20 World Cup\" beginning in 2020, as part of a goal to heighten its profile alongside the ICC's world championships for other formats (the Cricket World Cup for ODI, and ICC World Test Championship) [16] [17]\n\n\nTeams and qualification\nAs of 31 December 2018, the top nine ranked ICC Full Members, alongside hosts India, qualified directly for the 2021 tournament [39] [40] Of those ten teams, the top eight ranked sides qualified for the Super 12s stage of the tournament [39] Sri Lanka and Bangladesh did not qualify for the Super 12s, instead being placed in the group stage of the competition [39] They were joined by the six teams who had qualified for the tournament via the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier [39] Of the

top eight ranked T20I teams Originally, if Sri Lanka or Bangladesh qualified from their first round groups, they would have retained their respective seedings of A1 or B1 for the Super 12s [62] However, the ICC later changed this rule, after Scotland topped Group B and progressed as B1 [63] Those teams were then split into two groups of six each This was then followed by the two semi-finals

{"title": "Disappearance_of_Madeleine_McCann", "content": "\nBackground\nMadeleine McCann was born in Leicester and lived with her family in Rothley, Leicestershire At her parents' request, she was made a ward of court in England shortly after the disappearance, which gave the court statutory powers to act on her behalf [26] Police described Madeleine as blonde-haired with blue-green eyes, a small brown spot on her left calf, and a distinctive dark strip on the iris of her right eye [3] [b] In 2009 the McCanns released age-progressed images of how she may have looked at age six, and in 2012 Scotland Yard commissioned one of her at age nine [29] [30]\n\n\nMadeleine McCann\nMadeleine McCann was born in Leicester and lived with her family in Rothley, Leicestershire At her parents' request, she was made a ward of court in England shortly after the disappearance, which gave the court statutory powers to act on her behalf [26] Police described Madeleine as blonde-haired with blue-green eyes, a small brown spot on her left calf, and a distinctive dark strip on the iris of her right eye [3] [b] In 2009 the McCanns released age-progressed images of how she may have looked at age six, and in 2012 Scotland Yard commissioned one of her at age nine [29] [30]\n\n\nKate and Gerry McCann\nMadeleine's parents are both physicians and practising Roman Catholics Kate Marie McCann, née Healy (born 1968, Huyton, near Liverpool) attended All Saints School in Anfield, then Notre Dame High School in Everton Valley, graduating in 1992 with a degree in medicine from the University of Dundee She moved briefly into obstetrics and gynaecology, then anaesthetics, and finally general practice [31]\n\n\n\"Tapas Seven\"\nThe McCanns were on holiday with seven friends and eight children in all, including the McCanns' three [34] The nine adults dined together most evenings at 20:30 in the resort's tapas restaurant, as a result of which the media dubbed the friends the \"Tapas Seven\" [35] The report of one of the group, Jane Tanner, that she saw a man carry a child away from the resort 45 minutes before Madeleine was reported missing, became one of the most-discussed aspects of the case (See \"Tanner sighting\") [36]\n\n\nResort\nThe McCanns arrived on 28 April 2007 for their seven-night spring break in Praia da Luz, a village in Portugal's Algarve region with a population of 1,000, known as \"Little Britain\" because of the concentration of British homeowners and holidaymakers [37] They had booked through the British holiday company Mark Warner Ltd, and were placed in 5A Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva, an apartment owned by a retired teacher from Liverpool, one of several privately-owned properties the company rented [38]\n\n\nDisappearance\nThursday, 3 May 2007 was the penultimate day of the family's holiday Over breakfast Madeleine asked: \"Why didn't you come when  [my brother] and I cried last night?\" After the disappearance, her parents wondered whether this meant someone had entered the children's bedroom Her mother also noticed a large brown stain on Madeleine's pyjama top [45]\n\n\nDaytime: McCann family activities\nThursday, 3 May 2007 was the penultimate day of the family's holiday Over breakfast Madeleine asked: \"Why didn't you come when  [my brother] and I cried last night?\" After the disappearance, her parents wondered whether this meant someone had entered the children's bedroom Her mother also noticed a large brown stain on Madeleine's pyjama top [45]\n\n\n20:30: Tapas restaurant\nAt 20:30 the parents left 5A to dine with their friends in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas restaurant, located on the other side of the pool [48] 5A lay about 55 metres (180 ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the doors of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295 ft) [7] The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children There was a child-safety gate at the top of the steps from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street [48]\n\n\n21:15: Tanner sighting\nThe sighting by Jane Tanner, one of the Tapas Seven, of a man carrying a child that night, became an important part of the early investigation Tanner had left the restaurant just after 21:00 to check on her own daughter, passing Gerry on Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins on his way back to the restaurant from his 21:05 check He had stopped to chat to a British holidaymaker, [52] but neither man recalled having seen Tanner This puzzled the Portuguese police, given how narrow the street was, and led them to accuse Tanner of having invented the sighting [53]\n\n\n22:00: Smith sighting\nThe rejection of the Tanner sighting as crucial to the timeline allowed investigators to focus on another sighting of a man carrying a child on the night of Madeleine's disappearance, this one reported to Portuguese police on 26 May 2007 by Martin and Mary Smith, who had been in Praia da Luz on holiday from Ireland [62] Scotland Yard concluded in 2013 that the Smith sighting offered the approximate time of Madeleine's kidnapping [11] [63]\n\n\n22:00: Reported missing\nKate had intended to check on the children at 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on his own children in the apartment next door to 5A He noticed that the McCanns' children's bedroom door was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left 5A without looking far enough into the bedroom to see whether Madeleine was there He could not recall whether the bedroom window and its exterior shutter were open at this point Early on in the investigation, Portuguese police accused Oldfield of involvement because he had volunteered to do the check, suggesting to them that he had handed Madeleine to someone through the bedroom window [42] [67]\n\n\nEarly response\nTwo officers from the gendarmerie, the Guarda Nacional Republicana (GNR), arrived at the resort at 23:10 from Lagos, 5 miles (8 km) away [72] At midnight, after briefly searching, they alerted the criminal police, the Polícia Judiciária (PJ), in nearby Portimão Kate recounted that the PJ arrived just after 01:00 [73] According to the PJ, they arrived within 10 minutes of being alerted [74] At 02:00 two patrol dogs were brought to the resort, and at 08:00 four search and rescue dogs [75] Police officers had their leave cancelled and started searching waterways, wells, caves, sewers, and ruins around Praia da Luz [37] [76] Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, head of the PJ in Portimão, became the inquiry's coordinator [77]\n\n\nPortuguese police\nTwo officers from the gendarmerie, the Guarda Nacional Republicana (GNR), arrived at the resort at 23:10 from Lagos, 5 miles (8 km) away [72] At midnight, after briefly searching, they alerted the

ruins around Praia da Luz [37] [76] Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, head of the PJ in Portimão, became the inquiry's coordinator [77]\n\n\nBritish police\nIn the United Kingdom it was agreed that Madeleine's home force, Leicestershire Police—led by Chief Constable Matt Baggott—would coordinate the British response, although it remained a Portuguese inquiry [84] A strategic coordinating group, or \"gold\" group, was put together, representing Leicestershire Police, the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP), and the National Police Improvement Agency (NPIA) The PJ gave a British team a room in which to work, but apparently resented their presence British police were used to feeding their data into HOLMES 2 (the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System); in Portugal, the information was collected in boxes In addition the PJ had less autonomy than police in the UK, often having to wait for magistrates' decisions, which slowed things down In an interview for Anthony Summers's and Robbyn Swan's book Looking for Madeleine (2014), Jim Gamble, head of CEOP at the time, said Portuguese police felt they were being condescended to, and that the British were acting as a \"colonial power\" [85]\n\n\nMedia and PR\nA PJ officer acknowledged in 2010 that Portuguese police had been suspicious of the McCanns from the start because of the \"media circus\" [86] Gerry told Vanity Fair in 2008 that he had decided to \"market\" Madeleine to keep her in the public eye To that end, a string of public relations consultants arrived in Praia da Luz, deeply resented by the local police, who saw the media attention as counterproductive [37] Alex Woolfall of the British PR firm Bell Pottinger, representing Mark Warner Ltd, dealt with the media for the first ten days, then the British government sent in press officers This was apparently unprecedented [87]\n\n\nFirst Portuguese inquiry (2007–2008)\n\n\n\nFirst arguido\nTwelve days after Madeleine's disappearance, Robert Murat, a 34-year-old British-Portuguese property consultant, became the first arguido (suspect) in the case [100] [101] Born in Hammersmith, West London, Murat lived in his mother's house, Casa Liliana, 150 yards (137 m) from apartment 5A in the direction in which the man in the Tanner sighting had walked [100] He was named a suspect after a Sunday Mirror journalist told Portuguese police he had been asking about the case The PJ had briefly signed Murat up as an official interpreter; he said he had wanted to help because he had a daughter in England around Madeleine's age [102] [103]\n\n\nWitness statements\nIn statements to the PJ, witnesses described men behaving oddly near apartment 5A in the days before the disappearance and on the day itself Scotland Yard came to believe that these men may have been engaged in reconnaissance for an abduction or burglary There had been a fourfold increase in burglaries between January and May 2007, including two in the McCanns' block in the seventeen days before the disappearance, during which burglars had entered through windows [50] [113]\n\n\nMcCanns as arguidos\nThe first indication that the media were turning against the McCanns came on 6 June 2007, when a German journalist asked them during a Berlin press conference whether they were involved in the disappearance [122] [123] On 30 June a 3,000-word article entitled \"The Madeleine Case: A Pact of Silence\" appeared in Sol, a Portuguese weekly, stating that the McCanns were suspects, highlighting alleged inconsistencies between their statements and implying that the Tanner sighting had been invented [124] The reporters had obtained the Tapas Sevens' mobile numbers and that of another witness, so it was apparent that the inquiry had a leak [52] [123] [125]\n\n\nEarly suspicion\nThe first indication that the media were turning against the McCanns came on 6 June 2007, when a German journalist asked them during a Berlin press conference whether they were involved in the disappearance [122] [123] On 30 June a 3,000-word article entitled \"The Madeleine Case: A Pact of Silence\" appeared in Sol, a Portuguese weekly, stating

mobile numbers and that of another witness, so it was apparent that the inquiry had a leak [52] [123] [125]\n\n\nPortugal sends a letter rogatory\nOn 28 June 2007, the McCanns suggested to the PJ that the police request help from Danie Krugel, a South African former police officer who had developed a \"matter orientation system\", a handheld device that he claimed could locate missing people using DNA and satellites [53] On hearing about this years later, one scientist said it had caused his \"BS detector to go off the scale\" [134] Kate wrote in 2011 that Krugel's claims made no sense, but the couple were desperate In the second week of June they sent Krugel hair and eyelashes from Madeleine collected from the McCann family home by relatives in the UK Krugel arrived in Praia da Luz on 15 July and told the McCanns his equipment had picked up a \"static signal\" in an area of the beach near the Rocha Negra cliff [135] [53] [136]\n\n\nBritish sniffer dogs arrive\nKeela was a forensic investigation dog trained to give her handler, Martin Grime, a \"passive alert\" to the scent of human blood by placing her nose close to the spot, then freezing in that position Eddie was an enhanced-victim-recovery dog (EVRD, or cadaver dog) who gave a \"bark alert\" to the scent of human cadavers, including shortly after the death of the subject, even if the remains were buried, incinerated, or in water; he was trained to bark only in response to that scent and not for any other reason [140]\n\n\nBritish DNA analysis\nHair and other fibres were collected from areas in the car and apartment 5A where Keela and Eddie had given alerts, and were sent to the Forensic Science Service (FSS) in Birmingham for DNA profiling, arriving around 8 August 2007 [153] At this point, according to The Sunday Times, the PJ \"abandoned the abduction theory\" [53] On 8 August, without waiting for the results from Birmingham, Portuguese police called the McCanns to a meeting in Portimão, where Guilhermino Encarnação, PJ regional director, and Luis Neves, coordinator of the Direcção Central de Combate ao Banditismo in Lisbon, told them the case was now a murder inquiry [154] When Encarnação died of stomach cancer in 2010, The Daily Telegraph identified him as a major source of the leaks against the McCanns [155] Both the McCanns were interrogated that day; the officers suggested that Kate's memory was faulty [154]\n\n\nMcCanns made arguidos\nLowe's email was translated into Portuguese on 4 September 2007 The next day, according to Kate, the PJ proposed that, if she were to admit that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment and that she had hidden the body, she might only serve a two-year sentence Her husband would not be charged and would be free to leave [159] Both parents were given arguido status on 7 September, [160] and were advised by their lawyer not to answer questions The PJ told Gerry that Madeleine's DNA had been found in the car boot and behind the sofa in apartment 5A [161] Gerry did respond to questions, but Kate declined to reply to 48 questions she was asked during an eleven-hour interview [162]\n\n\nMcCanns return to the UK, Almeida report\nDespite their arguido status, the McCanns were allowed to leave Portugal, and on legal advice did so immediately, arriving back in England on 9 September 2007 [170] The following day Chief Inspector Tavares de Almeida of the PJ in Portimão signed a nine-page report concluding that Madeleine had died in apartment 5A as a result of an accident, that the restaurant meal and apparent regular checks on the McCann children had been part of the cover-up, that the Tapas Seven had helped to mislead the police, and that the McCanns had concealed the child's body before faking an abduction An eleven-page document from the Information Analysis Brigade in Lisbon analysed alleged discrepancies in the McCanns' statements [171] [86] On 11 September the public prosecutor, José Cunha de Magalhães e Meneses, handed the ten-volume case file to a judge, Pedro Miguel dos Anjos Frias [172] Meneses applied for the seizure of Kate's diary and Gerry's laptop [173] The police also wanted to trace telephone calls between the McCanns and the Tapas Seven, and there were details in the report about the number of suitcases the McCanns and their friends had taken back to England [174]\n\n\nGonçalo Amaral's removal, later developments\nOn 2 October 2007 Chief Inspector Gonçalo Amaral was removed from his post as the inquiry's coordinator and transferred to Faro after telling the newspaper Diário de Notícias that British police had only pursued leads helpful to the McCanns As an example, he criticised their decision to follow up an anonymous email to Prince Charles that claimed a former Ocean Club employee had taken Madeleine [77] [180]\n\n\nInquiry closed (21 July 2008)\nOn 21 July 2008 the Portuguese Attorney General, Fernando José Pinto Monteiro, announced that there was no evidence to link the McCanns or Robert Murat to Madeleine's disappearance Their arguido status was lifted and the case was closed [8] [9] On 4 August, Portugal's Ministério Público released seventeen case files containing 11,233 pages on CD-ROM to the media, including 2,550 pages of sightings [189] [f] The files included a 58-page prosecutors' report, which concluded: \"No element of proof whatsoever was found which allows us to form any lucid, sensible, serious, and honest conclusion about the circumstances.\" [191] In 2009 Portugal released a further 2,000 pages [192] Days after the case closed, excerpts from Kate's diary, which had been taken by the PJ in August 2007, were published in translation by a Portuguese tabloid, Correio da Manhã, despite a Portuguese judge's ruling in June 2008 that the seizure had been a privacy violation and that any copies must be destroyed [193] On 14 September 2008, a News International tabloid, News of the World, published the extracts, again without permission and now improperly translated back into English [194] [195]\n\n\nAmaral's book (24 July 2008)\nThe lingering tensions between the McCanns and the PJ had reached such a height that Amaral resigned from the force in June 2008 to write a book alleging that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment, and that to cover it up, the McCanns had faked an abduction [196] [77] Three days after the case closed, Amaral's book, Maddie: A Verdade da Mentira (\"Maddie: The Truth of the Lie\"), was published in Portugal by Guerra & Paz [197] By November 2008 it had sold 180,000 copies and by 2010 had been translated into six languages [198] [86] A documentary based on the book was broadcast on TVI in Portugal in April 2009, watched by 2.2 million viewers [199]\n\n\nMadeleine's Fund inquiry (2007–2011)\nThe McCanns set up Madeleine's Fund: Leaving No Stone Unturned Ltd on 15 May 2007, twelve days after the disappearance [206] [207] Over 80 million people visited the fund's website in the three months after the disappearance [37] From September 2007, Brian Kennedy of Everest Windows supported the couple financially, and Kennedy's lawyer joined the fund's board of directors [208] [209] [210] As of February 2017 [update] it had seven directors, including the McCanns [211]\n\n\nRaising money\nThe McCanns set up Madeleine's Fund: Leaving No Stone Unturned Ltd on 15 May 2007, twelve days after the disappearance [206] [207] Over 80 million people visited the fund's website in the three months after the disappearance [37] From September 2007, Brian Kennedy of Everest Windows supported the couple financially, and Kennedy's lawyer joined the fund's board of directors [208] [209] [210] As of February 2017 [update] it had seven directors, including the McCanns [211]\n\n\nPrivate investigators\nMadeleine's Fund hired several firms of private investigators, causing friction with Portuguese police Shortly after the disappearance, an anonymous benefactor paid for the services of a British security company, Control Risks [224] There had reportedly been four independent sightings from North Africa; Brian Kennedy went to Morocco himself in September 2007 to look into one [225] [226] [209] A Norwegian woman had reported seeing a girl matching Madeleine's description in a petrol station near Marrakesh, Morocco, on 9 May 2007; the child had reportedly asked the man she was with, in English, \"Can we see Mummy soon?\" When the witness returned home to Spain, she learned about the disappearance and telephoned the Spanish police A month later, according to Kate, the police had still not formally interviewed the woman, which led the McCanns to fear that leads were not being pursued The McCanns themselves travelled to Morocco on 10 June 2007 to raise awareness They spent the night at the British ambassador's residence and were briefed by consular staff and a Metropolitan Police attaché [227]\n\n\nOakley International\nIn 2008, Madeleine's Fund hired Oakley International, a Washington, D.C.-registered detective agency, for over £500,000 for six months [226] [232] Oakley sent a five-man team to Portugal led by Henri Exton, a former British police officer who had worked for MI5 The Oakley team engaged in undercover operations within the Ocean Club and among paedophile rings and the Roma community [226]\n\n\nFurther police inquiries (2011–present)\nThe McCanns met the British Home Secretary Alan Johnson in 2009 to request a review of the case [237] Johnson commissioned a scoping report from Jim Gamble of CEOP [155] [238] By March 2010, the Home Office had begun discussions with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) about setting up a British inquiry [155] [239]\n\n\nGamble report\nThe McCanns met the British Home Secretary Alan Johnson in 2009 to request a review of the case [237] Johnson commissioned a scoping report from Jim Gamble of CEOP [155] [238] By March 2010, the Home Office had begun discussions with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) about setting up a British inquiry [155] [239]\n\n\nOperation Grange\nIn May 2011, under Home Secretary Theresa May, Scotland Yard launched an investigative review, Operation Grange, with a team of 29 detectives and eight civilians [241] The announcement of the review appeared to have been triggered by a News International campaign by way of The Sun [221] The issue of whether this request was the result of \"threats\" or \"persuasion\" from News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks was one of the issues raised at the Leveson Inquiry [242] [243] [244] [245]\n\n\nFunding\nIn September 2018, the Home Office announced: \"We have received and are considering a request from the Metropolitan Police Service to extend funding for Operation Grange until the end of March 2019\" Up to that month, Operation Grange had cost £11.6m [258] In November 2018, an extra £150,000 is granted to continue the investigation, the latest in a series of six-month extensions which took the cost of Operation Grange to an estimated £11.75m June 2019, the British government said it would fund Operation Grange until March 2020.\n\n\nTheories: Planned abduction, burglary, wandered off\nDCI Redwood made clear that Operation Grange was looking at a \"criminal act by a stranger\", most likely a planned abduction or a burglary that Madeleine had disturbed [10] There had been a fourfold increase in local burglaries between January and May 2007, including two in the McCanns' block in the seventeen days before the disappearance, during which intruders had entered through windows [113] [50] In an interview in April 2017, just before the tenth anniversary of the disappearance, Scotland Yard's Assistant Commissioner, Mark Rowley, appeared to dismiss the burglary hypothesis, while adding that it was \"not entirely ruled out\" Referring to the suspects who might have been involved in burglaries in the area, he said that police had \"pretty much closed off that group of people\" The remaining detectives were focusing on a small number of inquiries that they believed were significant [13] [259] Also that month there were claims that Scotland Yard was looking for a woman seen near 5A at the time of the disappearance [260]\n\n\nTracking mobile phone calls\nUsing mobile-phone tracking techniques, and with the cooperation of over thirty countries, police traced who had used cell phones near the scene of Madeleine's disappearance within the important time frame [265] The analysis turned up several calls and texts near the Ocean Club between a 30-year-old former Ocean Club bus driver, and his 24-year-old and 53-year-old associates Detectives interviewed them in June 2014; they denied any connection to the disappearance [111] [266] Police also found that the cell phone of Euclides Monteiro, a former Ocean Club restaurant worker who had previously been fired for theft, had been used near the resort that night Originally from Cape Verde, Monteiro died in 2009 in a tractor accident The suspicion was that he had been breaking into apartments to finance a drug habit; his widow said he had been questioned previously about break-ins involving the sexual assault of children but had been cleared by DNA evidence [267]\n\n\nHoliday-home sexual assaults\nScotland Yard issued another appeal in March 2014 for information about a man who had entered holiday homes occupied by British families in four incidents in the western region of Algarve between 2004 and 2006, two of them in Praia da Luz On those occasions he had sexually assaulted five girls, aged 7–10, in their beds The man spoke English with a foreign accent and his speech was slow and perhaps slurred He had short, dark, unkempt hair, tanned skin, and in the view of three victims a distinctive smell; he may have worn a long-sleeved burgundy top, perhaps with a white circle on the back These were among twelve incidents reported in the area between 2004 and 2010 [268] The PJ reportedly believed the intruder in the four incidents between 2004 and 2006 was Monteiro [269]\n\n\nSearches and interviews in Praia da Luz\nIn June 2014, officers from Scotland Yard and the PJ, accompanied by archaeologists and sniffer dogs, searched drains and dug in 60,000 square metres (15 acres) of wasteland in Praia da Luz Nothing was found [270] The following month, at Scotland Yard's request, the PJ in Faro interviewed four Portuguese citizens, with Scotland Yard in attendance No evidence was found to implicate them [259] One man, an associate of Robert Murat, was first questioned shortly after the disappearance [110] [271] Pedro do Carmo, deputy director of the PJ, told the BBC that the interviews had been conducted only because Scotland Yard had requested them [272]\n\n\nGerman investigations in 2020\nIn June 2020, German prosecutors stated that they have \"concrete evidence\" that Christian Brückner [h] killed McCann [275] However, formal charges against Brückner by the court in Brunswick have been delayed due to confusion over where his last address in Germany was and thus which German court is responsible for the trial [275] Brückner has previously been convicted of unrelated counts of child sexual abuse and drug trafficking, and has since 2019 served a prison sentence in Germany for raping a 72-year-old American pensioner in the Algarve region He is scheduled for release in September 2025 [276] [15] [277] He was tried in 2024 in relation to five unrelated sexual offenses committed in Portugal between 2000 and 2017, and acquitted of those charges by a court in Brunswick on 8 October 2024 [278] [275] On 22 April 2022, Brückner was given arguido status by the Portuguese authorities, meaning they could extradite him to Portugal for formal questioning [279]\n\n\nOther inquiries\nIn the early days of the inquiry, Portuguese police searched through images seized from paedophile investigations, and Madeleine's parents were shown photographs of sex offenders in case they recognised them from Praia de Luz [295] Several British paedophiles were of interest In May 2009, investigators working for the McCanns tried to question one, Raymond Hewlett; he had allegedly told someone he knew what happened to Madeleine, but he retracted his statement and died of cancer in Germany in December of that year [296] Scotland Yard made inquiries about two paedophiles who had been in jail in Scotland for murder since 2010; the men had been running a window-cleaning service in the Canary Islands when Madeleine went missing [297]\n\n\nTabloids and social media\nEilis O'Hanlon wrote that the disappearance \"could almost stand as a metaphor for the rise of social media as the predominant mode of public discourse\" [21] Twitter, one year old when Madeleine McCann went missing, became the source of much of the vitriol [303] Ten years later, the \"#McCann\" hashtag was still producing over 100 tweets an hour, according to researchers at the University of Huddersfield [304] Social media's attacks included a threat to kidnap one of the McCanns' twins, [199] and when Scotland Yard and Crimewatch staged their reconstruction in 2013, there was apparently talk of phoning in with false information to sabotage the appeal [305] One man who ran an anti-McCann website received a three-month suspended sentence in 2013 after leafleting their village with his allegations [306] The following year a Twitter user was found dead from a helium overdose after Sky News confronted her about her 400 anti-McCann tweets [307]\n\n\n\"Trial by media\"\nEilis O'Hanlon wrote that the disappearance \"could almost stand as a metaphor for the

brought libel actions against several newspapers The Daily Express, Daily Star and their sister Sunday papers, owned by Northern & Shell, published front-page apologies in 2008 and donated £550,000 to Madeleine's Fund [23] The Tapas Seven were awarded £375,000 against the Express group, also donated to Madeleine's Fund, along with an apology in the Daily Express [220] The McCanns received £55,000 from The Sunday Times in 2013 when the newspaper implied that they had withheld e-fits from the police [235]\n\n\nNetflix documentary (2019)\nNetflix released an eight-part documentary series, The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann, on 15 March 2019 Interviewees included Jim Gamble, former head of CEOP; Alan Johnson, former British home secretary; Brian Kennedy, the British businessman who supported the McCanns financially; Justine McGuiness, the McCanns' former spokesperson; Gonçalo Amaral, former head of the PJ investigation; Robert Murat, the first arguido; Julian Peribañez, a former Método 3 private investigator; Sandra Felgueiras, a Portuguese journalist who covered the disappearance; and Anthony Summers and Robbyn Swan, authors of Looking for Madeleine (2014) [324] [325] The McCann family did not support the production of the documentary, refusing to take part and encouraging others not to be involved [326]\n\n\nSee also\nNews sources are listed in the References section

Leicestershire. At her parents' request, she was made a ward of court in England shortly after the disappearance, which gave the court statutory powers to act on her behalf. Police described Madeleine as blonde-haired with blue-green eyes, a small brown spot on her left calf, and a distinctive dark strip on the iris of her right eye.\n\nMadeleine McCann\nMadeleine McCann was born in Leicester and lived with her family in Rothley, Leicestershire.

Police described Madeleine as blonde-haired with blue-green eyes, a small brown spot on her left calf, and a distinctive dark strip on the iris of her right eye.\n\nKate and Gerry McCann\nMadeleine's parents are both physicians and practising Roman Catholics. Kate Marie McCann, née Healy (born 1968, Huyton, near Liverpool), attended All Saints School in Anfield, then Notre Dame High School in Everton Valley, graduating in 1992 with a degree in medicine from the University of Dundee. She moved briefly into obstetrics and gynaecology, then anaesthetics, and finally general practice.\n\n\"The Tapas Seven\"\nThe McCanns were on holiday with seven friends and eight children in all, including the McCanns' three. The nine adults dined together most evenings at 20:30 in the resort's tapas restaurant, as a result of which the media dubbed the friends the \"Tapas Seven.\" The report of one of the group, Jane Tanner, that she saw a man carry a child away from the resort 45 minutes before Madeleine was reported missing, became one of the most-discussed aspects of the case.\n\nResort\nThe McCanns arrived on 28 April 2007 for their seven-night spring break in Praia da Luz, a village in Portugal's Algarve region with a population of 1,000, known as \"Little Britain\" because of the concentration of British homeowners and holidaymakers. They had booked through the British holiday company Mark Warner Ltd, and were placed in 5A Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva, an apartment owned by a retired teacher from Liverpool, one of several privately-owned properties the company rented.\n\nDisappearance\nThursday, 3 May 2007 was the penultimate day of the family's holiday. Over breakfast Madeleine asked: \"Why didn't you come when [my brother] and I cried last night?\" After the disappearance, her parents wondered whether this meant someone had entered the children's bedroom. Her mother also noticed a large brown stain on Madeleine's pyjama top.\n\n20:30: Tapas restaurant\nAt 20:30 the parents left 5A to dine with their friends in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas restaurant, located on the other side of the pool. 5A lay about 55 metres (180 ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the doors of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295 ft). The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate at the top of the steps from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.\n\n21:15: Tanner sighting\nThe sighting by Jane Tanner, one of the Tapas Seven, of a man carrying a child that night, became an important part of the early investigation. Tanner had left the restaurant just after 21:00 to check on her own daughter, passing Gerry on Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins on his way back to the restaurant from his 21:05 check. He had stopped to chat to a British holidaymaker, but neither man recalled having seen Tanner. This puzzled the Portuguese police, given how narrow the street was, and led them to accuse Tanner of having invented the sighting.\n\n22:00: Smith sighting\nThe rejection of the Tanner sighting as crucial to the timeline allowed investigators to focus on another sighting of a man carrying a child on the night of Madeleine's disappearance, this one reported to Portuguese police on 26 May 2007 by Martin and Mary Smith, who had been in Praia da Luz on holiday from Ireland. Scotland Yard concluded in 2013 that the Smith sighting offered the approximate time of Madeleine's kidnapping.\n\n22:00: Reported missing\nKate had intended to check on the children at 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on his own children in the apartment next door to 5A. He noticed that the McCanns' children's bedroom door was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left 5A without looking far enough into the bedroom to see whether Madeleine was there. He could not recall whether the bedroom window and its exterior shutter were open at this point.\n\nEarly response\nTwo officers from the gendarmerie, the Guarda Nacional Republicana (GNR), arrived at the resort at 23:10 from Lagos, 5 miles (8 km) away. At midnight, after briefly searching, they alerted the criminal police, the Polícia Judiciária (PJ), in nearby Portimão. Kate recounted that the PJ arrived just after 01:00. According to the PJ, they arrived within 10 minutes of being alerted.\n\nPortuguese police\nTwo officers from the gendarmerie, the Guarda Nacional Republicana (GNR), arrived at the resort at 23:10 from Lagos, 5 miles (8 km) away.

According to the PJ, they arrived within 10 minutes of being alerted.\n\nBritish police\nIn the United Kingdom it was agreed that Madeleine's home force, Leicestershire Police—led by Chief Constable Matt Baggott—would coordinate the British response, although it remained a Portuguese inquiry. A strategic coordinating group, or \"gold\" group, was put together, representing Leicestershire Police, the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP), and the National Police Improvement Agency (NPIA).\n\nMedia and PR\nA PJ officer acknowledged in 2010 that Portuguese police had been suspicious of the McCanns from the start because of the \"media circus.\" Gerry told Vanity Fair in 2008 that he had decided to \"market\" Madeleine to keep her in the public eye. To that end, a string of public relations consultants arrived in Praia da Luz, deeply resented by the local police, who saw the media attention as counterproductive.\n\nFirst Portuguese inquiry (2007–2008)\nTwelve days after Madeleine's disappearance, Robert Murat, a 34-year-old British-Portuguese property consultant, became the first arguido (suspect) in the case. Born in Hammersmith, West London, Murat lived in his mother's house, Casa Liliana, 150 yards (137 m) from apartment 5A in the direction in which the man in the Tanner sighting had walked.\n\nFirst arguido\nTwelve days after Madeleine's disappearance, Robert Murat, a 34-year-old British-Portuguese property consultant, became the first arguido (suspect) in the case.

Scotland Yard came to believe that these men may have been engaged in reconnaissance for an abduction or burglary.\n\nMcCanns as arguidos\nThe first indication that the media were turning against the McCanns came on 6 June 2007, when a German journalist asked them during a Berlin press conference whether they were involved in the disappearance. On 30 June a 3,000-word article entitled \"The Madeleine Case: A Pact of Silence\" appeared in Sol, a Portuguese weekly, stating that the McCanns were suspects, highlighting alleged inconsistencies between their statements and implying that the Tanner sighting had been invented.\n\nEarly suspicion\nThe first indication that the media were turning against the McCanns came on 6 June 2007, when a German journalist asked them during a Berlin press conference whether they were involved in the disappearance.

Eddie was an enhanced-victim-recovery dog (EVRD, or cadaver dog) who gave a \"bark alert\" to the scent of human cadavers, including shortly after the death of the subject, even if the remains were

boxes In addition the PJ had less autonomy than police in the UK, often having to wait for magistrates' decisions, which slowed things down In an interview for Anthony Summers's and Robbyn Swan's book Looking for Madeleine (2014), Jim Gamble, head of CEOP at the time, said Portuguese police felt they were being condescended to, and that the British were acting as a \"colonial power\" [85]\n\n\nMedia and PR\nA PJ officer acknowledged in 2010 that Portuguese police had been suspicious of the McCanns from the start because of the \"media circus\" [86] Gerry told Vanity Fair in 2008 that he had decided to \"market\" Madeleine to keep her in the public eye To that end, a string of public relations consultants arrived in Praia da Luz, deeply resented by the local police, who saw the media attention as counterproductive [37] Alex Woolfall of the British PR firm Bell Pottinger, representing Mark Warner Ltd, dealt with the media for the first ten days, then the British government sent in press officers This was apparently unprecedented [87]\n\n\nFirst Portuguese inquiry (2007–2008)\n\n\n\nFirst arguido\nTwelve days after Madeleine's disappearance, Robert Murat, a 34-year-old British-Portuguese property consultant, became the first arguido (suspect) in the case [100] [101] Born in Hammersmith, West London, Murat lived in his mother's house, Casa Liliana, 150 yards (137 m) from apartment 5A in the direction in which the man in the Tanner sighting had walked [100] He was named a suspect after a Sunday Mirror journalist told Portuguese police he had been asking about the case The PJ had briefly signed Murat up as an official interpreter; he said he had wanted to help because he had a daughter in England around Madeleine's age [102] [103]\n\n\nWitness statements\nIn statements to the PJ, witnesses described men behaving oddly near apartment 5A in the days before the disappearance and on the day itself Scotland Yard came to believe that these men may have been engaged in reconnaissance for an abduction or burglary There had been a fourfold increase in burglaries between January and May 2007, including two in the McCanns' block in the seventeen days before the disappearance, during which burglars had entered through windows [50] [113]\n\n\nMcCanns as arguidos\nThe first indication that the media were turning against the McCanns came on 6 June 2007, when a German journalist asked them during a Berlin press conference whether they were involved in the disappearance [122] [123] On 30 June a 3,000-word article entitled \"The Madeleine Case: A Pact of Silence\" appeared in Sol, a Portuguese weekly, stating that the McCanns were suspects, highlighting alleged inconsistencies between their statements and implying that the Tanner sighting had been invented [124] The reporters had obtained the Tapas Sevens' mobile numbers and that of another witness, so it was apparent that the inquiry had a leak [52] [123] [125]\n\n\nEarly suspicion\nThe first indication that the media were turning against the McCanns came on 6 June 2007, when a German journalist asked them during a Berlin press conference whether they were involved in the disappearance [122] [123] On 30 June a 3,000-word article entitled \"The Madeleine Case: A Pact of Silence\" appeared in Sol, a Portuguese weekly, stating that the McCanns were suspects, highlighting alleged inconsistencies between their statements and implying that the Tanner sighting had been invented [124] The reporters had obtained the Tapas Sevens' mobile numbers and that of another witness, so it was apparent that the inquiry had a leak [52] [123] [125]\n\n\nPortugal sends a letter rogatory\nOn 28 June 2007, the McCanns suggested to the PJ that the police request help from Danie Krugel, a South African former police officer who had developed a \"matter orientation system\", a handheld device that he claimed could locate missing people using DNA and satellites [53] On hearing about this years later, one scientist said it had caused his \"BS detector to go off the scale\" [134] Kate wrote in 2011 that Krugel's claims made no sense, but the couple were desperate In the second week of June they sent Krugel hair and eyelashes from Madeleine collected from the McCann family home by relatives in the UK Krugel arrived in Praia da Luz on 15 July and told the McCanns his equipment had picked up a \"static signal\" in an area of the beach near the Rocha Negra cliff [135] [53] [136]\n\n\nBritish sniffer dogs arrive\nKeela was a forensic investigation dog trained to give her handler, Martin Grime, a \"passive alert\" to the scent of human blood by placing her nose close to the spot, then freezing in that position Eddie was an enhanced-victim-recovery dog (EVRD, or cadaver dog) who gave a \"bark alert\" to the scent of human cadavers, including shortly after the death of the subject, even if the remains were buried, incinerated, or in water; he was trained to bark only in response to that scent and not for any other reason [140]\n\n\nBritish DNA analysis\nHair and other fibres were collected from areas in the car and apartment 5A where Keela and Eddie had given alerts, and were sent to the Forensic Science Service (FSS) in Birmingham for DNA profiling, arriving around 8 August 2007 [153] At this point, according to The Sunday Times, the PJ \"abandoned the abduction theory\" [53] On 8 August, without waiting for the results from Birmingham, Portuguese police called the McCanns to a meeting in Portimão, where Guilhermino Encarnação, PJ regional director, and Luis Neves, coordinator of the Direcção Central de Combate ao Banditismo in Lisbon, told them the case was now a murder inquiry [154] When Encarnação died of stomach cancer in 2010, The Daily Telegraph identified him as a major source of the leaks against the McCanns [155] Both the McCanns were interrogated that day; the officers suggested that Kate's memory was faulty [154]\n\n\nMcCanns made arguidos\nLowe's email was translated into Portuguese on 4 September 2007 The next day, according to Kate, the PJ proposed that, if she were to admit that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment and that she had hidden the body, she might only serve a two-year sentence Her husband would not be charged and would be free to leave [159] Both parents were given arguido status on 7 September, [160] and were advised by their lawyer not to answer questions The PJ told Gerry that Madeleine's DNA had been found in the car boot and behind the sofa in apartment 5A [161] Gerry did respond to questions, but Kate declined to reply to 48 questions she was asked during an eleven-hour interview [162]\n\n\nMcCanns return to the UK, Almeida report\nDespite their arguido status, the McCanns were allowed to leave Portugal, and on legal advice did so immediately, arriving back in England on 9 September 2007 [170] The following day Chief Inspector Tavares de Almeida of the PJ in Portimão signed a nine-page report concluding that Madeleine had died in apartment 5A as a result of an accident, that the restaurant meal and apparent regular checks on the McCann children had been part of the cover-up, that the Tapas Seven had helped to mislead the police, and that the McCanns had concealed the child's body before faking an abduction An eleven-page document from the Information Analysis Brigade in Lisbon analysed alleged discrepancies in the McCanns' statements [171] [86] On 11 September the public prosecutor, José Cunha de Magalhães e Meneses, handed the ten-volume case file to a judge, Pedro Miguel dos Anjos Frias [172] Meneses applied for the seizure of Kate's diary and Gerry's laptop [173] The police also wanted to trace telephone calls between the McCanns and the Tapas Seven, and there were details in the report about the number of suitcases the McCanns and their friends had taken back to England [174]\n\n\nGonçalo Amaral's removal, later developments\nOn 2 October 2007 Chief Inspector Gonçalo Amaral was removed from his post as the inquiry's coordinator and transferred to Faro after telling the newspaper Diário de Notícias that British police had only pursued leads helpful to the McCanns As an example, he criticised their decision to follow up an anonymous email to Prince Charles that claimed a former Ocean Club employee had taken Madeleine [77] [180]\n\n\nInquiry closed (21 July 2008)\nOn 21 July 2008 the Portuguese Attorney General, Fernando José Pinto Monteiro, announced that there was no evidence to link the McCanns or Robert Murat to Madeleine's disappearance Their arguido status was lifted and the case was closed [8] [9] On 4 August, Portugal's Ministério Público released seventeen case files containing 11,233 pages on CD-ROM to the media, including 2,550 pages of sightings [189] [f] The files included a 58-page prosecutors' report, which concluded: \"No element of proof whatsoever was found which allows us to form any lucid, sensible, serious, and honest conclusion about the circumstances.\" [191] In 2009 Portugal released a further 2,000 pages [192] Days after the case closed, excerpts from Kate's diary, which had been taken by the PJ in August 2007, were published in translation by a Portuguese tabloid, Correio da Manhã, despite a Portuguese judge's ruling in June 2008 that the seizure had been a privacy violation and that any copies must be destroyed [193] On 14 September 2008, a News International tabloid, News of the World, published the extracts, again without permission and now improperly translated back into English [194] [195]\n\n\nAmaral's book (24 July 2008)\nThe lingering tensions between the McCanns and the PJ had reached such a height that Amaral resigned from the force in June 2008 to write a book alleging that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment, and that to cover it up, the McCanns had faked an abduction [196] [77] Three days after the case closed, Amaral's book, Maddie: A Verdade da Mentira (\"Maddie: The Truth of the Lie\"), was published in Portugal by Guerra & Paz [197] By November 2008 it had sold 180,000 copies and by 2010 had been translated into six languages [198] [86] A documentary based on the book was broadcast on TVI in Portugal in April 2009, watched by 2.2 million viewers [199]\n\n\nMadeleine's Fund inquiry (2007–2011)\nThe McCanns set up Madeleine's Fund: Leaving No Stone Unturned Ltd on 15 May 2007, twelve days after the disappearance [206] [207] Over 80 million people visited the fund's website in the three months after the disappearance [37] From September 2007, Brian Kennedy of Everest Windows supported the couple financially, and Kennedy's lawyer joined the fund's board of directors [208] [209] [210] As of February 2017 [update] it had seven directors, including the McCanns [211]\n\n\nRaising money\nThe McCanns set up Madeleine's Fund: Leaving No Stone Unturned Ltd on 15 May 2007, twelve days after the disappearance [206] [207] Over 80 million people visited the fund's website in the three months after the disappearance [37] From September 2007, Brian Kennedy of Everest Windows supported the couple financially, and Kennedy's lawyer joined the fund's board of directors [208] [209] [210] As of February 2017 [update] it had seven directors, including the McCanns [211]\n\n\nPrivate investigators\nMadeleine's Fund hired several firms of private investigators, causing friction with Portuguese police Shortly after the disappearance, an anonymous benefactor paid for the services of a British security company, Control Risks [224] There had reportedly been four independent sightings from North Africa; Brian Kennedy went to Morocco himself in September 2007 to look into one [225] [226] [209] A Norwegian woman had reported seeing a girl matching Madeleine's description in a petrol station near Marrakesh, Morocco, on 9 May 2007; the child had reportedly asked the man she was with, in English, \"Can we see Mummy soon?\" When the witness returned home to Spain, she learned about the disappearance and telephoned the Spanish police A month later, according to Kate, the police had still not formally interviewed the woman, which led the McCanns to fear that leads were not being pursued The McCanns themselves travelled to Morocco on 10 June 2007 to raise awareness They spent the night at the British ambassador's residence and were briefed by consular staff and a Metropolitan Police attaché [227]\n\n\nOakley International\nIn 2008, Madeleine's Fund hired Oakley International, a Washington, D.C.-registered detective agency, for over £500,000 for six months [226] [232] Oakley sent a five-man team to Portugal led by Henri Exton, a former British police officer who had worked for MI5 The Oakley team engaged in undercover operations within the Ocean Club and among paedophile rings and the Roma community [226]\n\n\nFurther police inquiries (2011–present)\nThe McCanns met the British Home Secretary Alan Johnson in 2009 to request a review of the case [237] Johnson commissioned a scoping report from Jim Gamble of CEOP [155] [238] By March 2010, the Home Office had begun discussions with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) about setting up a British inquiry [155] [239]\n\n\nGamble report\nThe McCanns met the British Home Secretary Alan Johnson in 2009 to request a review of the case [237] Johnson commissioned a scoping report from Jim Gamble of CEOP [155] [238] By March 2010, the Home Office had begun discussions with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) about setting up a British inquiry [155] [239]\n\n\nOperation Grange\nIn May 2011, under Home Secretary Theresa May, Scotland Yard launched an investigative review, Operation Grange, with a team of 29 detectives and eight civilians [241] The announcement of the review appeared to have been triggered by a News International campaign by way of The Sun [221] The issue of whether this request was the result of \"threats\" or \"persuasion\" from News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks was one of the issues raised at the Leveson Inquiry [242] [243] [244] [245]\n\n\nFunding\nIn September 2018, the Home Office announced: \"We have received and are considering a request from the Metropolitan Police Service to extend funding for Operation Grange until the end of March 2019\" Up to that month, Operation Grange had cost £11.6m [258] In November 2018, an extra £150,000 is granted to continue the investigation, the latest in a series of six-month extensions which took the cost of Operation Grange to an estimated £11.75m June 2019, the British government said it would fund Operation Grange until March 2020.\n\n\nTheories: Planned abduction, burglary, wandered off\nDCI Redwood made clear that Operation Grange was looking at a \"criminal act by a stranger\", most likely a planned abduction or a burglary that Madeleine had disturbed [10] There had been a fourfold increase in local burglaries between January and May 2007, including two in the McCanns' block in the seventeen days before the disappearance, during which intruders had entered through windows [113] [50] In an interview in April 2017, just before the tenth anniversary of the disappearance, Scotland Yard's Assistant Commissioner, Mark Rowley, appeared to dismiss the burglary hypothesis, while adding that it was \"not entirely ruled out\" Referring to the suspects who might have been involved in burglaries in the area, he said that police had \"pretty much closed off that group of people\" The remaining detectives were focusing on a small number of inquiries that they believed were significant [13] [259] Also that month there were claims that Scotland Yard was looking for a woman seen near 5A at the time of the disappearance [260]\n\n\nTracking mobile phone calls\nUsing mobile-phone tracking techniques, and with the cooperation of over thirty countries, police traced who had used cell phones near the scene of Madeleine's disappearance within the important time frame [265] The analysis turned up several calls and texts near the Ocean Club between a 30-year-old former Ocean Club bus driver, and his 24-year-old and 53-year-old associates Detectives interviewed them in June 2014; they denied any connection to the disappearance [111] [266] Police also found that the cell phone of Euclides Monteiro, a former Ocean Club restaurant worker who had previously been fired for theft, had been used near the resort that night Originally from Cape Verde, Monteiro died in 2009 in a tractor accident The suspicion was that he had been breaking into apartments to finance a drug habit; his widow said he had been questioned previously about break-ins involving the sexual assault of children but had been cleared by DNA evidence [267]\n\n\nHoliday-home sexual assaults\nScotland Yard issued another appeal in March 2014 for information about a man who had entered holiday homes occupied by British families in four incidents in the western region of Algarve between 2004 and 2006, two of them in Praia da Luz On those occasions he had sexually assaulted five girls, aged 7–10, in their beds The man spoke English with a foreign accent and his speech was slow and perhaps slurred He had short, dark, unkempt hair, tanned skin, and in the view of three victims a distinctive smell; he may have worn a long-sleeved burgundy top, perhaps with a white circle on the back These were among twelve incidents reported in the area between 2004 and 2010 [268] The PJ reportedly believed the intruder in the four incidents between 2004 and 2006 was Monteiro [269]\n\n\nSearches and interviews in Praia da Luz\nIn June 2014, officers from Scotland Yard and the PJ, accompanied by archaeologists and sniffer dogs, searched drains and dug in 60,000 square metres (15 acres) of wasteland in Praia da Luz Nothing was found [270] The following month, at Scotland Yard's request, the PJ in Faro interviewed four Portuguese citizens, with Scotland Yard in attendance No evidence was found to implicate them [259] One man, an associate of Robert Murat, was first questioned shortly after the disappearance [110] [271] Pedro do Carmo, deputy director of the PJ, told the BBC that the interviews had been conducted only because Scotland Yard had requested them [272]\n\n\nGerman investigations in 2020\nIn June 2020, German prosecutors stated that they have \"concrete evidence\" that Christian Brückner [h] killed McCann [275] However, formal charges against Brückner by the court in Brunswick have been delayed due to confusion over where his last address in Germany was and thus which German court is responsible for the trial [275] Brückner has previously been convicted of unrelated counts of child sexual abuse and drug trafficking, and has since 2019 served a prison sentence in Germany for raping a 72-year-old American pensioner in the Algarve region He is scheduled for release in September 2025 [276] [15] [277] He was tried in 2024 in relation to five unrelated sexual offenses committed in Portugal between 2000 and 2017, and acquitted of those charges by a court in Brunswick on 8 October 2024 [278] [275] On 22 April 2022, Brückner was given arguido status by the Portuguese authorities, meaning they could extradite him to Portugal for formal questioning [279]\n\n\nOther inquiries\nIn the early days of the inquiry, Portuguese police searched through images seized from paedophile investigations, and Madeleine's parents were shown photographs of sex offenders in case they recognised them from Praia de Luz [295] Several British paedophiles were of interest In May 2009, investigators working for the McCanns tried to question one, Raymond Hewlett; he had allegedly told someone he knew what happened to Madeleine, but he retracted his statement and died of cancer in Germany in December of that year [296] Scotland Yard made inquiries about two paedophiles who had been in jail in Scotland for murder since 2010; the men had been running a window-cleaning service in the Canary Islands when Madeleine went missing [297]\n\n\nTabloids and social media\nEilis O'Hanlon wrote that the disappearance \"could almost stand as a metaphor for the rise of social media as the predominant mode of public discourse\" [21] Twitter, one year old when Madeleine McCann went missing, became the source of much of the vitriol [303] Ten years later, the \"#McCann\" hashtag was still producing over 100 tweets an hour, according to researchers at the University of Huddersfield [304] Social media's attacks included a threat to kidnap one of the McCanns' twins, [199] and when Scotland Yard and Crimewatch staged their reconstruction in 2013, there was apparently talk of phoning in with false information to sabotage the appeal [305] One man who ran an anti-McCann website received a three-month suspended sentence in 2013 after leafleting their village with his allegations [306] The following year a Twitter user was found dead from a helium overdose after Sky News confronted her about her 400 anti-McCann tweets [307]\n\n\n\"Trial by media\"\nEilis O'Hanlon wrote that the disappearance \"could almost stand as a metaphor for the rise of social media as the predominant mode of public discourse\" [21] Twitter,

[307]\n\n\nLibel actions\nIn addition to their legal efforts against Gonçalo Amaral and his publisher, the McCanns and Tapas Seven brought libel actions against several newspapers The Daily Express, Daily Star and their sister Sunday papers, owned by Northern & Shell, published front-page apologies in 2008 and donated £550,000 to Madeleine's Fund [23] The Tapas Seven were awarded £375,000 against the Express group, also donated to Madeleine's Fund, along with an apology in the Daily Express [220] The McCanns received £55,000 from The Sunday Times in 2013 when the newspaper implied that they had withheld e-fits from the police [235]\n\n\nNetflix documentary (2019)\nNetflix released an eight-part documentary series, The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann, on 15 March 2019 Interviewees included Jim Gamble, former head of CEOP; Alan Johnson, former British home secretary; Brian Kennedy, the British businessman who supported the McCanns financially; Justine McGuiness, the McCanns' former spokesperson; Gonçalo Amaral, former head of the PJ investigation; Robert Murat, the first arguido; Julian Peribañez, a former Método 3 private investigator; Sandra Felgueiras, a Portuguese journalist who covered the disappearance; and Anthony Summers and Robbyn Swan, authors of Looking for Madeleine (2014) [324] [325] The McCann family did not support the production of the documentary, refusing to take part and encouraging others not to be involved [326]\n\n\nSee also\nNews sources are listed in the References section only.\n\n\nNotes\nNews sources are listed in the References

Born in South Korea, she began acting as a child in the late 1960s and went on to become one of the most respected and beloved actresses in Korean cinema.\n\n**Career**\n\nKang began professionally acting as a child in 1969. As a child actress, she appeared in a number of low-profile movies and TV shows in the 1970s and 1980s. Her early start in the industry laid the foundation for her successful career, which would see her transition from child star to adult actress, earning her a reputation as a talented and dedicated performer.\n\n**1970s–1991**\n\nAs a child actress, Kang appeared in a number of movies and TV shows, often playing roles that showcased her versatility and range. Her early performances laid the groundwork for her future success, demonstrating her ability to adapt to a wide range of genres and characters. Despite her early start, Kang's success in the 1970s and 1980s was largely limited to low-profile productions, and it would take several years for her to gain widespread recognition.\n\n**1990s**\n\nIn the 1990s, Kang's career experienced a significant resurgence, with her appearing in a number of critically acclaimed movies. One of the most notable films of this period was Jang Sun-woo's \"Road to the Racetrack\" (1991), which earned her several accolades for best actress at award ceremonies, including the Baeksang Arts Awards, Chunsa Film Art Awards, and the Blue Dragon Film Awards. Another notable film from this period was \"That Woman, That Man\" (1993) by Kim Ui-seok, which was a commercial success at the box office and earned Kang another Baeksang Arts Award for Most Popular Actress. Her performances in these films cemented her status as a leading actress in Korean cinema, and she went on to appear in several other notable films, including Lee Myung-se's \"Their Last Love Affair\" (1996) and Im Sang-soo's debut, \"Girls' Night Out\" (1998).\n\n**2000s**\n\nAfter a fifteen-year gap, Kang returned to television in 2001, starring in \"Ladies of the Palace\" (여인 천하; Yeo-in cheon-ha), a historical drama that aired on SBS TV. The 150-episode series was successful, and it managed to garner her renewed visibility among mainstream audiences. Her performance as Jeong Nan-jeong enabled her to win a daesang, awarded by the channel. This return to television marked a new chapter in Kang's career, as she continued to appear in a variety of productions, both on screen and on stage.\n\n**2010s and 2020s**\n\nThroughout the 2010s, Kang only appeared in two films, one of which was Im Kwon-taek's \"Hanji\" (2011). Despite her relatively limited output during this period, Kang continued to be recognized for her contributions to Korean cinema, and she remained a respected and beloved figure in the industry.\n\n**Death**\n\nAt 5:48 p.m (KST) on May 5, 2022, Kang was found unconscious at her home in southern Seoul by first responders.

She won the grand prize and took her first acting lessons. An agent signed her nine months later. Her first film appearance was a small role in the 1994 feature Camp Nowhere as Gail.

He rose to fame with his breakout role in Top Gun: Maverick, but his journey to stardom began long before. This article will explore his early life, education, and career, highlighting his struggles and successes in the entertainment industry.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n\nGlen Thomas Powell Jr was raised in Austin, Texas, along with two sisters. He is the son of Glen Powell Sr., an executive coach, and Cyndy, a homemaker. Powell has paternal Lipka Tatar ancestry, from a great-great-grandfather Mustapha (a.k.a Stephen) Chutsky. Growing up, Powell was an active athlete, playing high school football and lacrosse at Westwood High School in northwest Austin, where he graduated in 2007.\n\nAfter high school, Powell attended the Moody College of Communication at the University of Texas at Austin, but he left before finishing his degree. Initially, he expected to complete the requirements in spring 2024, but after his career limited his time commitments, he moved his goal to 2025.\n\nCareer\n\nPowell's acting career began while working with Antonio Banderas and Sylvester Stallone in Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over. In 2007, before his first year of college, Powell landed a role in The Great Debaters, directed by and starring Denzel Washington. Washington introduced him to agent Ed Limato, who encouraged Powell to move to Los Angeles. After moving to the city, Powell stayed with a friend of the family, and he later described struggling during this period to get roles, including failed auditions for Friday Night Lights, Cowboys & Aliens, and The Longest Ride.\n\nHowever, he saw some success with small credits in television series, including Into the West, Jack & Bobby, CSI: Miami, NCIS, Without a Trace, Rizzoli & Isles, and The Lying Game. He also had minor parts in The Dark Knight Rises and Stuck in Love. Powell's early work was marked by a willingness to take on small roles and accept direction from more experienced actors.\n\nEarly Work and Breakthrough (2003-2017)\n\nPowell's acting career began to gain momentum in the early 2010s, with appearances in films such as Stuck in Love and The Dark Knight Rises. However, it was his breakout role in Set It Up, released in 2018, that brought him widespread recognition. The romantic comedy, directed by Claire Scanlon and starring Zoey Deutch, showcased Powell's charm and comedic timing.\n\nThe movie's success marked a turning point in Powell's career, as he started getting more calls from contacts in the film industry. Jake Greenburg of The Guardian commented that Set It Up was the \"first movie wise enough to let  [Powell] take up real space.\" Powell's performance in the film earned him a nomination for the People's Choice Award for Favorite Comedic Movie Actor.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick and Expansion (2018-Present)\n\nIn 2018, Powell joined the cast of Top Gun: Maverick, directed by Joseph Kosinski and starring Tom Cruise. He had initially auditioned for the role of Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw, but the part went to Miles Teller. Powell's audition impressed producers, who offered him the role of Jake \"Hangman\" Seresin instead. However, Powell was reluctant to take the role because he viewed the character as underdeveloped.\n\nA call from Tom Cruise, the star of the film, convinced Powell to accept the part, with Cruise offering him greater control over the character. The film was delayed multiple times due to the pandemic, but it turned into a \"breakout role\" for Powell upon its release in May 2022.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nPowell started dating model Gigi Paris in 2019, but their breakup became public in April 2023. Powell is a licensed pilot, and Tom Cruise paid for him to attend flight school. Powell has declared himself a diehard fan of the Texas Longhorns. In 2024, Powell relocated from Los Angeles back to his hometown of Austin, Texas.\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\n* Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over (2003)\n* The Great Debaters (2007)\n* Stuck in Love (2012)\n* The Dark Knight Rises (2012)\n* Set It Up (2018)\n* Live by Night (2016)\n* Top Gun: Maverick (2022)\n\nTelevision\n\n* Into the West (2005)\n* Jack & Bobby (2004-2005)\n* CSI: Miami (2007)\n* NCIS (2010)\n* Without a Trace (2009)\n* Rizzoli & Isles (2010-2012)\n* The Lying Game (2011-2013)\n\nAudio\n\n* The Great Debaters (2007)\n* Live by Night (2016)\n\nAwards and Nominations\n\n* People's Choice Award for Favorite Comedic Movie Actor (2019) - Nominated\n* Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actor: Comedy (2019) - Nominated\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal Links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Glen_Powell\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nGlen Thomas Powell Jr was raised in Austin, Texas, along with two sisters [4] He is the son of Glen Powell Sr., an executive coach, and Cyndy, a homemaker [5] He has paternal Lipka Tatar ancestry, from a great-great-grandfather Mustapha (a.k.a Stephen) Chutsky [6] Powell graduated from Westwood High School in northwest Austin in 2007, where he played high school football and lacrosse [7] [8] He attended the Moody College of Communication at the University of Texas at Austin but left before finishing his degree He initially expected to complete the requirements in spring 2024, but after his career limited his time commitments, he moved his goal to 2025 [9] [10]\n\n\nCareer\nPowell's acting career began while working with Antonio Banderas and Sylvester Stallone in Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over [11] In 2007, before his first year of college, Powell landed a role in The Great Debaters, directed by and starring Denzel Washington [12] [13] [14] Washington introduced him to agent Ed Limato, who encouraged Powell to move to Los Angeles After moving to the city, Powell stayed with a friend of the family, and he later described struggling during this period to get roles, including failed auditions for Friday Night Lights, Cowboys & Aliens, and The Longest Ride [10] [15] However, he saw some success with small credits in television series, including Into the West, Jack & Bobby, CSI: Miami, NCIS, Without a Trace, Rizzoli & Isles, and The Lying Game He also had minor parts in The Dark Knight Rises and Stuck in Love [16]\n\n\nEarly work and breakthrough (2003–2017)\nPowell's acting career began while working with Antonio Banderas and Sylvester Stallone in Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over [11] In 2007, before his first year of college, Powell landed a role in The Great Debaters, directed by and starring Denzel Washington [12] [13] [14] Washington introduced him to agent Ed Limato, who encouraged Powell to move to Los Angeles After moving to the city, Powell stayed with a friend of the family, and he later described struggling during this period to get roles, including failed auditions for Friday Night Lights, Cowboys & Aliens, and The Longest Ride [10] [15] However, he saw some success with small credits in television series, including Into the West, Jack & Bobby, CSI: Miami, NCIS, Without a Trace, Rizzoli & Isles, and The Lying Game He also had minor parts in The Dark Knight Rises and Stuck in Love [16]\n\n\nTop Gun: Maverick and expansion (2018–present)\nIn 2018, Powell starred opposite Zoey Deutch in the romantic comedy Set it Up [23] The movie was released on Netflix Powell reflected in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that he started getting more calls from contacts in the film industry after the movie's release, [24] and Jake Greenburg of The Guardian commented that it was the \"first movie wise enough to let  [Powell] take up real space\" [25] Later that year, Powell joined the cast of Top Gun: Maverick [26] He had initially auditioned for the role of Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw, but the part went to Miles Teller Powell's audition impressed producers, who offered him the role of Jake \"Hangman\" Seresin instead but Powell was reluctant to take the role because he viewed the character as underdeveloped A call from Tom Cruise, the star of the film, convinced Powell to accept the part, with Cruise offering him greater control over the character [15] [27] The film was delayed multiple times due to the pandemic, but it turned into a \"breakout role\" for Powell upon its release in May 2022 [24]\n\n\nPersonal life\nPowell started dating model Gigi Paris in 2019;

made his Formula Three debut at the Nürburgring, joining SG Formula's Formula 3 Euro Series team Despite only a short amount of experience in the car, Ricciardo qualified in eighth for the first race, which later converted into sixth in the race after James Jakes and Christian Vietoris stalled on the grid But he struggled in the reverse-grid race, finishing just fifteenth [18]\n\n\nFormula Renault

Bull Racing at the young drivers test at Circuito de Jerez over three days, starting on 1 December 2009 [28] On the final day of testing, he clocked the fastest time of the test by over a second This

June 2011, Ricciardo was contracted to Hispania Racing by Red Bull Racing, replacing Narain Karthikeyan for the remaining races of the 2011 season (excepting the Indian Grand Prix, to allow Karthikeyan to race at his home Grand Prix) [38] Ricciardo made his Grand Prix debut at the 2011 British Grand Prix at Silverstone Circuit [39]\n\n\nToro Rosso (2012–2013)\nOn 14 December 2011, it was

first race of the season, the Australian Grand Prix, Ricciardo qualified in second place behind Lewis Hamilton [68] and completed the race in second place, despite pressure from rookie Kevin Magnussen in the final laps Ricciardo was later disqualified, as his car was ruled to have exceeded the mandated hourly fuel flow rate limit [69] Had he not been disqualified, it would have marked the first time an Australian had made the podium at the Australian Grand Prix since the race became part of the World Championship [70] Infiniti Red Bull Racing filed an appeal against the disqualification, which was rejected by the International Court of Appeal, the FIA decision being upheld [71]\n\n\n2015\nOn 8 February 2015, during the third episode of series 22 of the popular British motoring

record-holder Lewis Hamilton with a time of 1:42.2 [92]\n\n\n2016\nIn a much more competitive Red Bull, Ricciardo began the season well, finishing 4th in both Australia and Bahrain and qualifying 2nd and then leading early on in the Chinese Grand Prix before suffering a tyre blowout and finishing in 4th again [102] [103] [104] Ricciardo qualified third at the Spanish Grand Prix, and after the two Mercedes cars of Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg crashed out on the first lap, he led the early stages of the race [105] After a remarkable strategy call by Ferrari resulting in a very short third stint for Sebastian Vettel, Red Bull decided to answer this by pitting Ricciardo again and covering Vettel, also going for the presumed faster three-stop strategy [106] This dropped him behind Vettel, new teammate Max Verstappen and Kimi Räikkönen on track, and after a few failed attempts at passing Vettel, a tyre blowout late on in the race meant that he finished fourth again, behind eventual winner Verstappen, and the Ferraris of Räikkönen and Vettel [107]\n\n\n2017\nRicciardo qualified 10th in Australia after spinning into the tyre barrier in Q3 [133] He incurred a five-place grid penalty due to an unscheduled gearbox change as a result of the crash A gearbox sensor issue prevented him from taking the start and when he did get going, two laps down, a sudden fuel pressure problem ended his race after 25 laps [134] [135] In China, Ricciardo would finish fourth after narrowly losing out to teammate Max Verstappen on the last lap [136] Starting fourth at the Bahrain Grand Prix, [137] and after a poor safety car restart which dropped him three places, he was able to pass Felipe Massa and finish in fifth [138] He endured a second retirement in four races at the Russian Grand Prix, pulling out on lap 5 due to brake issues Ricciardo scored his first podium of the year, with third in Spain, albeit finishing over a minute behind the leaders [139] This marked the start of five consecutive podiums He qualified fifth at the Monaco Grand Prix, [140] and a strong overcut allowed him to jump Verstappen and Valtteri Bottas for another third place [141] Yet another third place followed  in Canada after jumping Kimi Räikkönen, and inheriting positions after Vettel stopped for a front wing change and  Verstappen retired [142]\n\n\n2018\nRicciardo started the season with a fourth-place in Australia, from eighth on the grid after a three-place penalty for speeding under red flag conditions [162] [163] In Bahrain, he recorded a non-finish after an electrical failure on the second lap [164] His result in the 2018 Chinese Grand Prix was much better, taking a commanding victory by almost nine seconds, after starting sixth on the grid [165] [166] Running sixth for majority of the race, he and teammate Max Verstappen both pitted for fresher tyres under the safety car on lap 30 Ricciardo would put on an overtaking masterclass, overtaking five cars in a span of eight laps to win the race [167] At the 2018 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, Ricciardo qualified in fourth [168] He was fighting for fourth with teammate Max Verstappen in the latter half of the race On lap 40, both drivers collided, Ricciardo's front wing made heavy contact with his teammate's rear, and the incident caused both drivers to retire [169] [170] Following the race, Horner stated that both

failure in Bahrain, having run well in the points in the latter race [210] [211] A first Q3 appearance followed in China followed, [212] before driving to his first points finish with Renault in seventh place [213] In Azerbaijan, Ricciardo reversed into Daniil Kvyat when both cars stopped after an overtake attempt by Ricciardo, causing race-ending damage for both drivers and Ricciardo's third retirement in four races [214] Six consecutive race finishes followed, he finished 13th at the Spanish Grand Prix after a questionable race strategy [215] He had his best qualifying thus far with sixth in Monaco, [216] but a late call to pit before the safety car, dropped to ninth at the flag [217] Ricciardo had a successful weekend in Canada, improving his personal best qualifying position to fourth [218] He proceeded to finish in sixth place, having held off a faster Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas for numerous laps [219]\n\n\n2019\nOn 3 August 2018, it was announced that Ricciardo had signed

On lap four, Pierre Gasly collided with Ricciardo, causing floor damage to his car, resulting in the loss of a considerable amount of downforce. Despite the performance loss, Ricciardo was able to finish the season opener in seventh.\n\n**2022**\n\nRicciardo missed the final day of the 2022 pre-season test in Bahrain, due to a positive COVID-19 test on 11 March. He was released from isolation in time for the opening race of the season, on 20 March. In the opening season race at the Bahrain Grand Prix, the Australian qualified 18th and finished the race in 14th ahead of his teammate Norris in 15th, due to a lack of pace and three driver retirements.\n\n**Red Bull third driver (2023)**\n\nAfter leaving McLaren at the conclusion of the 2022 season, Daniel Ricciardo elected to rejoin Red Bull Racing as a third driver for the 2023 season. The role saw him complete PR activities, assist in simulator and factory work and, while attending race weekends, access chat channels and communications to support the race team.\n\n**AlphaTauri/RB (2023–2024)**\n\nAfter Nyck de Vries was released from his AlphaTauri seat in July 2023, Ricciardo was announced to fill the vacant seat, making his return to Formula One for the 2023 Hungarian Grand Prix, partnered with Yuki Tsunoda. Ricciardo qualified and finished in 13th position in his first race back with AlphaTauri in Hungary, despite a first-lap incident that dropped him into last.\n\n**2023**\n\nAfter Nyck de Vries was released from his AlphaTauri seat in July 2023, Ricciardo was announced to fill the vacant seat, making his return to Formula One for the 2023 Hungarian Grand Prix, partnered with Yuki Tsunoda.

He finished the race in 13th place, having swapped positions with Tsunoda in an attempt to overtake Kevin Magnussen in 12th in the last six laps.\n\n**Driver profile**\n\nRicciardo is known for his aggressive style as well as favouring a late braking manoeuvre to engineer overtakes. Ricciardo also prefers to carry more speed through the corner by making it more of a 'U' shape, utilising a little rear instability on entry to turn in, and enough grip to rotate the car mid-corner without the rear breaking away.\n\n**Public image**\n\nRicciardo is regarded as one of the most prominent names in Formula One. He is known for his laid-back nature and smile, with The New York Times describing him in 2016 saying, \"If a survey could be made of the 22 Formula One drivers to establish who smiles the most, has the sunniest disposition and seems to be generally the nicest guy, Ricciardo would surely be the leader.\"\n\n**Personal life**\n\nRicciardo pronounces his surname \"Ricardo\" (/ˈrɪkɑːrdoʊ/) instead of the Italian pronunciation ( [ritˈtʃardo], with a \"ch\"-sound), attributing this to the way it was usually pronounced growing up in Australia and by his family.\n\n**Awards and honours**\n\n*

championship driving a 15-year-old Van Diemen, finishing eighth by season's end [14]\n\n\nFormula Three\nDuring the mid-part of the 2008 season, Ricciardo made his Formula Three debut at the Nürburgring, joining SG Formula's Formula 3 Euro Series team Despite only a short amount of experience in the car, Ricciardo qualified in eighth for the first race, which later converted into sixth in the race after James Jakes and Christian Vietoris stalled on the grid But he struggled in the reverse-grid race, finishing just fifteenth [18]\n\n\nFormula Renault 3.5 Series\nOn 30 October 2009, Ricciardo was signed by Tech 1 to compete in the 2010 season [21] He had competed with the team at the Autódromo Internacional do Algarve in Portugal in 2009 and was the teammate to Brendon Hartley, another driver who drove for Tech 1 over the season.\n\n\nFormula One career\nRicciardo made his track debut at the wheel of a Formula One car when he tested for Red Bull Racing at the young drivers test at Circuito de Jerez over three days, starting on 1 December 2009 [28] On the final day of testing, he clocked the fastest time of the test by over a second This placed him as the only driver to go into the 1:17 bracket [29] Red Bull Racing's team manager Christian Horner suggested that Ricciardo may replace his 2010 World Series teammate Hartley as the team's test and reserve driver [30]

test and reserve duties for both Red Bull and sister team Scuderia Toro Rosso [31] until the latter was removed from the Red Bull Junior team [32]\n\n\nHRT (2011)\nOn 30 June 2011, Ricciardo was contracted to Hispania Racing by Red Bull Racing, replacing Narain Karthikeyan for the remaining races of the 2011 season (excepting the Indian Grand Prix, to allow Karthikeyan to race at his home Grand Prix) [38] Ricciardo made his Grand Prix debut at the 2011 British Grand Prix at Silverstone Circuit [39]\n\n\nToro Rosso (2012–2013)\nOn 14 December 2011, it was confirmed that Ricciardo would

at Infiniti Red Bull Racing at the start of the 2014 Formula One season, partnering Sebastian Vettel, a four-time world champion [66] [67]\n\n\n2014\nIn the first race of the season, the Australian Grand Prix, Ricciardo qualified in second place behind Lewis Hamilton [68] and completed the race in second place, despite pressure from rookie Kevin Magnussen in the final laps Ricciardo was later disqualified, as his car was ruled to have exceeded the mandated hourly fuel flow rate limit [69] Had he not been disqualified, it would have marked the first time an Australian had made the podium at the Australian Grand Prix since the race became part of the World Championship [70] Infiniti Red Bull Racing filed an appeal against the disqualification, which was rejected by the International Court of Appeal, the FIA decision being upheld [71]\n\n\n2015\nOn 8 February 2015, during the third episode of series 22 of the popular British motoring television programme Top Gear, Ricciardo became the fastest Formula One driver to perform a lap of the Top Gear test track during the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car feature, beating the previous record-holder Lewis Hamilton with a time of 1:42.2 [92]\n\n\n2016\nIn a much more competitive Red Bull, Ricciardo began the season well, finishing 4th in both Australia and Bahrain and qualifying 2nd and then leading early on in the Chinese Grand Prix before suffering a tyre blowout and finishing in 4th again [102] [103] [104] Ricciardo qualified third at the Spanish Grand Prix, and after the two Mercedes cars of Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg crashed out on the first lap, he led the early stages of the race [105] After a remarkable strategy call by Ferrari resulting in a very short third stint for Sebastian Vettel, Red Bull decided to answer this by pitting Ricciardo again and covering Vettel, also going for the presumed faster three-stop strategy [106] This dropped him behind Vettel, new teammate Max Verstappen and Kimi Räikkönen on track, and after a few failed attempts at passing Vettel, a tyre blowout late on in the race meant that he finished fourth again, behind eventual winner Verstappen, and the Ferraris of Räikkönen and Vettel [107]\n\n\n2017\nRicciardo qualified 10th in Australia after spinning into the tyre barrier in Q3 [133] He incurred a five-place grid penalty due to an unscheduled gearbox change as a result of the crash A gearbox sensor issue prevented him from taking the start and when he did get going, two laps down, a sudden fuel pressure problem ended his race after 25 laps [134] [135] In China, Ricciardo would finish fourth after narrowly losing out to teammate Max Verstappen on the last lap [136] Starting fourth at the Bahrain Grand Prix, [137] and after a poor safety car restart which dropped him three places, he was able to pass Felipe Massa and finish in fifth [138] He endured a second retirement in four races at the Russian Grand Prix, pulling out on lap 5 due to brake issues Ricciardo scored his first podium of the year, with third in Spain, albeit finishing over a minute behind the leaders [139] This marked the start of five consecutive podiums He qualified fifth at the Monaco Grand Prix, [140] and a strong overcut allowed him to jump Verstappen and Valtteri Bottas for another third place [141] Yet another third place followed  in Canada after jumping Kimi Räikkönen, and inheriting positions after Vettel stopped for a front wing change and  Verstappen retired [142]\n\n\n2018\nRicciardo started the season with a fourth-place in Australia, from eighth on the grid after a three-place penalty for speeding under red flag conditions [162] [163] In Bahrain, he recorded a non-finish after an electrical failure on the second lap [164] His result in the 2018 Chinese Grand Prix was much better, taking a commanding victory by almost nine seconds, after starting sixth on the grid [165] [166] Running sixth for majority of the race, he and teammate Max Verstappen both pitted for fresher tyres under the safety car on lap 30 Ricciardo would put on an overtaking masterclass, overtaking five cars in a span of eight laps to win the race [167] At the 2018 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, Ricciardo qualified in fourth [168] He was fighting for fourth with teammate Max Verstappen in the latter half of the race On lap 40, both drivers collided, Ricciardo's front wing made heavy contact with his teammate's rear, and the incident caused both drivers to retire [169] [170] Following the race, Horner stated that both drivers were ordered to \"apologise\" at the Red Bull factory [171]\n\n\nRenault (2019–2020)\nOn 3 August 2018, it was announced that Ricciardo had signed a contract to drive for Renault in 2019 and 2020 [208] His teammate for the 2019 season was Nico Hülkenberg [209] Ricciardo had a poor start to the season with retirements in the first two races, from front wing damage in Australia and power failure in Bahrain, having run well in the points in the latter race [210] [211] A first Q3 appearance followed in China followed, [212] before driving to his first points finish with Renault in seventh place [213] In Azerbaijan, Ricciardo reversed into Daniil Kvyat when both cars stopped after an overtake attempt by Ricciardo, causing race-ending damage for both drivers and Ricciardo's third retirement in four races [214] Six consecutive race finishes followed, he finished 13th at the Spanish Grand Prix after a questionable race strategy [215] He had his best qualifying thus far with sixth in Monaco, [216] but a late call to pit before the safety car, dropped to ninth at the flag [217] Ricciardo had a successful weekend in Canada, improving his personal best qualifying position to fourth [218] He proceeded to finish in sixth place, having held off a faster Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas for numerous laps [219]\n\n\n2019\nOn 3 August 2018, it was announced that Ricciardo had signed a contract to drive for Renault in

He was born on 12 July 1905 at York Cottage on the Sandringham Estate, during the reign of his paternal grandfather, King Edward VII. John's early life was marked by illness, which led to his seclusion and eventual death at the age of 13.\n\n**# Birth**\n\nJohn was born at 3:05 am on 12 July 1905, at York Cottage on the Sandringham Estate, a private country house in Norfolk, England. He was the youngest child and fifth son of King George V and Queen Mary. At the time of his birth, John was sixth in the line of succession to the throne, behind his father and four older brothers. As a grandchild of the reigning British monarch in the male line, and a son of the Prince of Wales, he was formally styled His Royal Highness Prince John of Wales from birth.\n\nJohn's birth was not without controversy, as the name John had been associated with ill fortune in the British royal family. However, his parents decided to name him John nonetheless, and he was informally known as \"Johnnie\" by the family. The decision to give John this name may have been a testament to the royal family's desire to break with tradition and create a sense of continuity with the past.\n\n**# Childhood and illness**\n\nMuch of John's early life was spent at Sandringham with his siblings – Prince Edward (known as David to the royal family), Prince Albert (known as Bertie), Princess Mary, Prince Henry, and Prince George – under the care of their nanny, Charlotte \"Lala\" Bill. Although a strict disciplinarian, John's father was affectionate toward his children, and his mother was close to her children and encouraged them to confide in her.\n\nIn 1909, John's grandaunt, the Dowager Empress of Russia, wrote to her son, King George V, describing John's brothers and sisters as \"very nice\" and praising John in particular as \"both charming and very amusing.\" Another of John's aunts, Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, remembered John as \"very quaint\" and recalled an incident in which John had soliloquized after watching his father kiss his mother, saying, \"She kissed Papa, ugly old man!\"\n\nDespite these positive descriptions, John's health began to decline at an early age. He suffered from seizures, which became more frequent and severe over time. His family and caregivers did their best to manage his condition, but ultimately, they were unable to find a cure.\n\n**# Wood Farm**\n\nIn 1916, as John's seizures became more intense and unpredictable, his family decided to send him to live at Wood Farm, a secluded location on the Sandringham Estate. Wood Farm was situated far from the main house, and John was cared for by Lala Bill, who had been his nanny since childhood.\n\nAlthough John's formal education ended at this point, he remained interested in the world around him and was capable of coherent thought and expression. Despite his physical limitations, John was a bright and curious child who continued to learn and grow.\n\nHowever, John's seizures became increasingly severe, and his family grew concerned about his well-being. They feared that his condition would worsen if he were to be exposed to the stresses of public life or the normal activities of his siblings.\n\n**# Death**\n\nJohn's health continued to decline, and his seizures intensified over the course of the next two years. His family and caregivers did everything they could to manage his condition, but ultimately, John's condition became too severe to manage.\n\nOn 18 January 1919, John's family gathered at Sandringham House to celebrate Christmas together. However, as the day drew to a close, John was driven back to Wood Farm, where he spent the rest of the evening alone.\n\nThe next morning, John's family awoke to find that he had passed away during the night, at the age of 13. His death was a shock to the royal family, and it marked a significant turning point in their lives.\n\n**# Legacy**\n\nJohn's death was a significant loss for his family and the wider royal household. Despite his physical limitations, John had been a beloved member of the family, and his passing left a void that could not be filled.\n\nIn the years that followed, John's family struggled to come to terms with their loss. Prince Edward, John's older brother, was particularly affected, and he wrote an insensitive letter to Queen Mary, which has since been lost.\n\nHowever, Prince Edward later wrote a letter of apology to Queen Mary, in which he acknowledged the pain he had caused and expressed his regret for his thoughtless words.\n\nIn the end, John's legacy was one of love, loss, and tragedy. He may have been a member of the British royal family, but he was also a human being, with hopes, dreams, and feelings. His story serves as a reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of cherishing every moment.\n\n**# Ancestry**\n\nJohn's ancestry is a complex and fascinating topic, with roots that stretch back centuries.

The little ones, George and Johnny are both charming and very amusing\" [9] John's aunt Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, described him as \"very quaint and one evening when Uncle George returned from stalking he bent over Aunt May and kissed her, and they heard Johnny soliloquize, 'She kissed Papa, ugly old man!'\" [10] George V once told U.S President Theodore Roosevelt that \"all  [his] children  [were] obedient, except John\"—​apparently because he alone, among the king's children, escaped punishment from their father [2]\n\n\nWood Farm\nIn 1916, as his seizures became more frequent and severe, John was sent to live at Wood Farm, with Lala Bill in charge of his care [15] He maintained an interest in the world around him and was capable of coherent thought and expression, [16] but with his lack of educational progress, the last of his tutors was dismissed and his formal education ended Physicians warned that it was unlikely that he would reach adulthood [2]\n\n\nDeath\nJohn's seizures intensified, and Bill later wrote \"we dared not let him be with his brothers and sister, because it upsets them so much, with the attacks getting so bad and coming so often.\" [2] Biographer Denis Judd believes that John's \"seclusion and 'abnormality' must have been disturbing to his brothers and sister\", as he had been \"a friendly, outgoing little boy, much loved by his brothers and sister, a sort of mascot for the family\" [17] He spent Christmas Day 1918 with his family at Sandringham House but was driven back to Wood Farm at night.\n\n\nLegacy\nPrince Edward, who was 11 years older than John and had hardly known him, saw his death as \"little more than a regrettable nuisance.\" [27] He wrote an insensitive letter to Queen Mary, which has since been lost [2] She did not reply, but he felt compelled to write her an apology, in which he stated:\n\nAncestry\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nEndnotes\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on January 1, 1973, in the Guru Bazar neighborhood of Srinagar, Dar was a member of the Kashmiri Muslim community and was drawn into militancy at a young age.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nDar was born into a family of modest means and was the youngest of several siblings. His early life was marked by a strong sense of community and cultural identity, with his family belonging to the Dar clan, a prominent Kashmiri Muslim family. Dar's nickname \"Bitta\" was a common term of endearment in Kashmiri culture, while \"Karate\" was added to his name due to his proficiency in martial arts. As a young boy, Dar was fascinated by the stories of Kashmiri martyrs and freedom fighters, which instilled in him a strong sense of nationalism and a desire to fight for the rights of his community.\n\n**Terrorism**\n\nIn 1988, Dar's life took a dramatic turn when he was recruited by the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), a separatist organization fighting for Kashmir's independence from India. The then-JKLF chief commander, Ashfaq Majeed Wani, took Dar across the Line of Control (LoC) to Pakistan-administered Kashmir for armed training. Dar was blindfolded and taken to a secret training camp along with other recruits, where they underwent a 32-day training program in guerrilla warfare and military tactics. This marked the beginning of Dar's journey as a militant, and he soon became known for his bravery and skills on the battlefield.\n\n**1990 Arrest**\n\nOn June 22, 1990, Dar was arrested by the Border Security Force (BSF) while he was involved in a militant operation in Srinagar. He was detained under the Public Safety Act (PSA) and had 19 cases filed against him. Dar was subsequently held in various prisons across India, including Kot Bhalwal Jail in Jammu, District Jail in Kathua, Central Jail in Jodhpur, and Central Jail in Agra. He spent 16 long years in prison, during which time he was subjected to various forms of torture and mistreatment.\n\n**2006 Indefinite Bail and Release**\n\nOn October 23, 2006, a court in Jammu granted Dar bail under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA). He was released from prison on October 25, 2006, after spending 16 years behind bars. Dar's release was met with both jubilation and condemnation, with some Kashmiri Pandit organizations expressing outrage over his release. Despite this, Dar received a warm reception from his supporters in Kashmir, who showered him with flower petals and confetti as he emerged from prison. A large procession was held in his honor, with prayers offered at an Eidgah in Srinagar.\n\n**2006-2019 Political Career**\n\nUpon his release from prison, Dar joined the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (R), a faction of the JKLF, and worked his way up to become its chairman. During this period, Dar was involved in various political activities, including advocating for the rights of Kashmiri prisoners and campaigning for peace and reconciliation in the region. He also played a key role in promoting the JKLF's ideology and agenda, which emphasized the need for Kashmir's independence from India.\n\n**2019 Arrest and Detention in Terror Funding Case**\n\nIn 2019, Dar was arrested again by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on charges of terror funding. The NIA alleged that Dar, along with other accused, had conspired to wage war against the government and foment trouble in the Kashmir Valley. Dar's co-accused included Sayeed Salahudeen, the head of the Hizbul Mujahideen, a militant organization based in Pakistan. Dar's arrest and detention sparked widespread protests in Kashmir, with many viewing it as a politically motivated move by the Indian government.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF)\n* Public Safety Act (PSA)\n* Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA)\n* National Investigation Agency (NIA)\n* Sayeed Salahudeen\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and may not be comprehensive or up-to-date.\n* The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of any individual or organization.\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Farooq Ahmed Dar: The Kashmiri Militant Who Became a Political Leader.\" The Indian Express, August 2019.\n* \"Bitta Karate: The Militant Who Was Released After 16 Years in Prison.\" The Hindu, October 2006.\n* \"JKLF Chairman Farooq Ahmed Dar Arrested in Terror Funding Case.\" The Economic Times, August 2019.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* \"Kashmir: A History of Conflict and Contestation.\" By Srinivasan, K.

nurse and painter Their father, Ron Wachowski, was a businessman of Polish descent Their uncle is an actor and Primetime Emmy Award-winning producer, Laurence Luckinbill [2] [10] Ron and Lynne died five weeks apart in the late 2010s [11] Lana and Lilly have two other sisters, Julie and Laura [12] [13] Julie was assistant coordinator for the film Bound; [14] she is a novelist and screenwriter [15]\n\n\nFilm and television careers\nIn the mid-1990s, they went into film writing, including the script for Assassins in 1994, which was directed by Richard Donner and released in 1995 Warner Bros bought the script and included two more pictures in the contract [18] Donner had their script \"totally rewritten\" by Brian Helgeland [19] and the Wachowskis tried unsuccessfully to remove their names from the film [12] They say the experience gave them the perspective that they should become directors or \" [they will] never survive as writers in this town\" [20]\n\n\nEarly film projects\nIn

experience gave them the perspective that they should become directors or \" [they will] never survive as writers in this town\" [20]\n\n\nThe Matrix franchise\nThey completed The Matrix, a science fiction action film, in 1999 The movie stars Keanu Reeves as Neo, a hacker recruited by a rebellion to aid them in the fight against machines who have taken over the world and placed humanity inside a simulated reality called \"the Matrix\" Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving and Joe Pantoliano also star The movie was a critical and commercial hit for Warner Bros It won four Academy Awards, including for \"Best Visual Effects\" for popularizing the bullet time visual effect The Matrix came to be a major influence for action movies and has appeared in several \"greatest science fiction films\" lists [23] [24] [25] In 2012, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant\" [26]\n\n\nLater collaborations\nThe Wachowskis' next feature film was V for Vendetta, an adaptation of Alan Moore and David Lloyd's graphic novel of the same name, starring Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving They wrote and produced the film with Matrix producer Joel Silver, who had previously purchased the film rights to the graphic novel The Wachowskis offered the film to James McTeigue, the first assistant director of The Matrix trilogy, as his directorial debut Moore did not participate in the production, as he was disappointed by previous Hollywood adaptations of his work, and disagreed with differences between his graphic novel and the screenplay Following a statement to the press by Silver that Moore was supposedly excited to learn more about the movie, Moore demanded that Silver retract it, and had his own name removed from the credits when he did not [32] The film's controversial storyline and themes have been both criticized and praised by sociopolitical groups It was released in 2005 and was well received critically; it was a box office success but did not rank on the scale of The Matrix films [33] The film popularized the image of the Guy Fawkes mask, as the version designed by David Lloyd for the graphic novel and used in the movie was adopted as a symbol by the online hacktivist group Anonymous two years later [34]\n\n\nSolo projects\nIn May 2019, it was reported that Lilly would co-write, and co-showrun the eight-episode first season of the drama-comedy series Work in Progress, created by Abby McEnany and Tim Mason for Showtime [70] The series premiered in December 2019 [71] In January 2020, the series was renewed for a 10-episode second season, with which Lilly would continue to be involved [72]\n\n\nStyle and influences\nJ Michael Straczynski, who has worked with the Wachowskis on Ninja Assassin and Sense8, has said that the sisters told him they were reading his column on scriptwriting for the Writer's Digest magazine, for inspiration and pointers [77] Straczynski contributed to the magazine from 1981 to 1991 [78]\n\n\nFrequent collaborators\nThe Wachowskis frequently hire the same basic film crew to make their movies Lana says they do it in part to ensure a positive environment \"It's like family Everyone is very respectful of each other,\" says Lana [94] They used the same practice while selecting the television crew for their Netflix show, Sense8.\n\n\nCrew members\n(Season 2)\n\n\nCast member\n(Season 2)\n\n\nFilm production and comic book publishing\nDuring The Matrix Reloaded, The Matrix Revolutions, The Animatrix and Enter the Matrix production, the Wachowskis created EON Entertainment (not to be confused with Eon Productions), their production company to coordinate and direct all involved partners [140] It is also where the films were edited together, after the various FX vendors sent their finished work [141] EON's internal VFX team, ESC, did a number of visual effect shots for the two Matrix sequels and coordinated the other vendors [141] ESC was shut down in summer 2004 [142] Anarchos Productions (credited in Cloud Atlas as Anarchos Pictures) [143] is their production company [144] [145] that has been billed for all their films starting with V for Vendetta up to the first season of Sense8 [146] In the second season and following Lilly's break from the show, Anarchos is replaced by Venus Castina Productions, [147] a production company created by Lana Wachowski and her wife Karin Winslow [148] Venus Castina is an epithet of the Roman goddess Venus, who in this form, was supposedly associated with \"the yearnings of feminine souls locked up in male bodies\" In the Sense8 series finale, the real book Venus Castina: Famous Female Impersonators

made significant contributions to the film industry. Lana Wachowski and Lilly Wachowski (formerly known as Andy Wachowski) have worked together on numerous projects, creating a unique and innovative style that has captivated audiences worldwide.\n\n**Early lives and careers**\n\nLana Wachowski was born in Chicago in 1965, while Lilly Wachowski was born two and a half years later, in 1967. Their mother, Lynne (née Luckinbill), was a nurse and painter, and their father, Ron Wachowski, was a businessman of Polish descent. Their uncle is an actor and Primetime Emmy Award-winning producer, Laurence Luckinbill. Ron and Lynne died five weeks apart in the late 2010s. Lana and Lilly have two other sisters, Julie and Laura. Julie was assistant coordinator for the film Bound and is a novelist and screenwriter.\n\n**Film and television careers**\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the Wachowskis went into film writing, including the script for Assassins in 1994, which was directed by Richard Donner and released in 1995. Warner Bros bought the script and included two more pictures in the contract. Donner had their script \"totally rewritten\" by Brian Helgeland, and the Wachowskis tried unsuccessfully to remove their names from the film. They say the experience gave them the perspective that they should become directors or \"they will never survive as writers in this town.\"\n\n**The Matrix franchise**\n\nThe Wachowskis completed The Matrix, a science fiction action film, in 1999. The movie stars Keanu Reeves as Neo, a hacker recruited by a rebellion to aid them in the fight against machines who have taken over the world and placed humanity inside a simulated reality called \"the Matrix.\" Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano also star. The movie was a critical and commercial hit for Warner Bros, winning four Academy Awards, including for \"Best Visual Effects\" for popularizing the bullet time visual effect. The Matrix came to be a major influence for action movies and has appeared in several \"greatest science fiction films\" lists. In 2012, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant.\"\n\n**Later collaborations**\n\nThe Wachowskis' next feature film was V for Vendetta, an adaptation of Alan Moore and David Lloyd's graphic novel of the same name, starring Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving. They wrote and produced the film with Matrix producer Joel Silver, who had previously purchased the film rights to the graphic novel. The Wachowskis offered the film to James McTeigue, the first assistant director of The Matrix trilogy, as his directorial debut. Moore did not participate in the production, as he was disappointed by previous Hollywood adaptations of his work, and disagreed with differences between his graphic novel and the screenplay. Following a statement to the press by Silver that Moore was supposedly excited to learn more about the movie, Moore demanded that Silver retract it, and had his own name removed from the credits when he did not. The film's controversial storyline and themes have been both criticized and praised by sociopolitical groups. It was released in 2005 and was well received critically; it was a box office success but did not rank on the scale of The Matrix films. The film popularized the image of the Guy Fawkes mask, as the version designed by David Lloyd for the graphic novel and used in the movie was adopted as a symbol by the online hacktivist group Anonymous two years later.\n\n**Solo projects**\n\nIn May 2019, it was reported that Lilly would co-write and co-showrun the eight-episode first season of the drama-comedy series Work in Progress, created by Abby McEnany and Tim Mason for Showtime. The series premiered in December 2019. In January 2020, the series was renewed for a 10-episode second season, with which Lilly would continue to be involved.\n\n**Style and influences**\n\nJ Michael Straczynski, who has worked with the Wachowskis on Ninja Assassin and Sense8, has said that the sisters told him they were reading his column on scriptwriting for the Writer's Digest magazine, for inspiration and pointers. Straczynski contributed to the magazine from 1981 to 1991.\n\n**Frequent collaborators**\n\nThe Wachowskis frequently hire the same basic film crew to make their movies. Lana says they do it in part to ensure a positive environment. \"It's like family. Everyone is very respectful of each other,\" says Lana. They used the same practice while selecting the television crew for their Netflix show, Sense8.\n\n**Crew members**\n\nSeason 2\n\n**Film production and comic book publishing**\n\nDuring The Matrix Reloaded, The Matrix Revolutions, The Animatrix, and Enter the Matrix production, the Wachowskis created EON Entertainment (not to be confused with Eon Productions), their production company to coordinate and direct all involved partners. It is also where the films were edited together, after the various FX vendors sent their finished work. EON's internal VFX team, ESC, did a number of visual effect shots for the two Matrix sequels and coordinated the other vendors. ESC was shut down in summer 2004. Anarchos Productions (credited in Cloud Atlas as Anarchos Pictures) is their production company that has been billed for all their films starting with V for Vendetta up to the first season of Sense8. In the second season and following Lilly's break from the show, Anarchos is replaced by Venus Castina Productions, a production company created by Lana Wachowski and her wife Karin Winslow. Venus Castina is an epithet of the Roman goddess Venus, who in this form, was supposedly associated with \"the yearnings of feminine souls locked up in male bodies.\" In the Sense8 series finale, the real book Venus Castina: Famous Female Impersonators Celestial and Human makes an appearance as the unlikely object that brought a lesbian couple together; according to Lana and the actresses that portray the couple, the duo have been based on Lana and Karin.\n\n**Unrealized projects**\n\nThe Wachowskis' first script was a thriller called Carnivore. It has been described as \"a Corman-style, low-budget horror movie that dealt with cannibalism or, more specifically, rich people being eaten by cannibals.\" The writing was well received and the script achieved notice for the duo; however, interest in making the movie was low, for executives told them: \"This is a bad idea. I can't make this. I'm rich.\" Years later, on April 6, 1999, a week after The Matrix opened in American theaters, Variety reported Trimark was looking to buy the script and were in talks with George Romero to direct it with production scheduled to begin in August. In April 2001, news of the Wachowskis producing it for Lionsgate and looking for a director surfaced again, and in August 2003 a second time, with their go-to cinematographer Bill Pope rumored to be making his directorial debut with it. The film ultimately went unproduced.\n\n**Personal lives**\n\nLilly married Alisa Blasingame in 1991. In 2016, Lilly mentioned having a boyfriend. In 2019, she said Mickey Ray Mahoney was now her partner and that they had moved in together. Mahoney is an adjunct professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and a trans man.\n\n**Lana's gender transition**\n\nRumors that Lana Wachowski was transitioning spread in the early 2000s, though neither sister spoke directly on the subject at the time. In 2003, Gothamist reported the possible transition. In a 2007 interview, Joel Silver, the producer of numerous Wachowski films, said that the rumors concerning the transition were \"all untrue,\" saying that \"they just don't do interviews, so people make things up.\" Crew members working on Speed Racer said similar things.\n\n**Lilly's gender transition**\n\nIn March 2016, Lilly Wachowski also came out as a transgender woman, issuing a statement to the Windy City Times after a visit from a reporter from the Daily Mail newspaper who had attempted to get an interview with her about it.

Transgender people without support, means and privilege do not have this luxury. And many do not survive.\"\n\n**Gaming**\n\nThe Wachowskis are self-proclaimed gamers. As teens, they spent their weekends in the attic playing Dungeons & Dragons. They liken the process of their gaming sessions to their process of filmmaking.

\"repeating digits\" [18]\n\n\n1980–1990: Success with Macintosh\nIn December 1979, Steve Jobs and Apple employees, including Jef Raskin, visited Xerox PARC, where they observed the Xerox Alto, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) Apple subsequently negotiated access to PARC's technology, leading to Apple's option to buy shares at a preferential rate This visit influenced Jobs to implement a GUI in Apple's products, starting with the Apple Lisa Despite being pioneering as a mass-marketed GUI computer, the Lisa suffered from high costs and limited software options, leading to commercial failure.\n\n\n1990–1997: Decline and restructuring\nThe company pivoted strategy and, in October 1990, introduced three lower-cost models: the Macintosh Classic, the Macintosh LC, and the Macintosh IIsi, all of which generated significant sales due to pent-up demand [53] In 1991, Apple introduced the hugely successful PowerBook with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops The same year, Apple introduced System 7, a major upgrade to the Macintosh operating system, adding color to the interface and introducing new networking capabilities.\n\n\n1997–2007: Return to profitability\nThe NeXT acquisition was finalized on February 9, 1997, [71] and the board brought Jobs back to Apple as an advisor On July 9, 1997, Jobs staged a boardroom coup that resulted in Amelio's resignation after overseeing a three-year record-low stock price and crippling financial losses The board named Jobs as interim CEO and he immediately reviewed the product lineup Jobs canceled 70% of models, ending 3,000 jobs and paring to the core of its computer offerings [72]\n\n\n2007–2011: Success with mobile devices\nDuring his keynote speech at the Macworld Expo on January 9, 2007, Jobs announced the renaming of Apple Computer, Inc to Apple Inc., because the company had broadened its focus from computers to consumer electronics [105] This event also saw the announcement of the iPhone [106] and the Apple TV [107] The company sold 270,000 first-generation iPhones during the first 30 hours of sales, [108] and the device was called \"a game changer for the industry\" [109]\n\n\n2011–present: Post-Jobs era, Tim Cook\nOn October 5, 2011, Steve Jobs died, marking the end of an era for Apple [130] The next major product announcement by Apple was on January 19, 2012, when Apple's Phil Schiller introduced iBooks Textbooks for iOS and iBook Author for Mac OS X in New York City [131] Jobs stated in the biography Steve Jobs that he wanted to reinvent the textbook industry and education [132]\n\n\nProducts\nSince the company's founding and into the early 2000s, Apple primarily sold computers, which are marketed as Macintosh since the mid-1980s Since then, the company has expanded its product categories to include various portable devices, starting with the now discontinued iPod (2001), and later with the iPhone (2007) and iPad (2010) Apple also sells several other products that it categorizes as \"Wearables, Home and Accessories\", such as the Apple Watch, Apple TV, AirPods, HomePod, and Vision Pro Apple devices have been praised for creating a cohesive ecosystem when used in conjunction with other Apple products [178]\n\n\nMac\nMac, which is short for Macintosh—its official name until 1999—is Apple's line of personal computers that use the company's proprietary macOS operating system Personal computers were Apple's original business line, but as of the end of 2024 [update] they account for only about eight percent of the company's revenue [1]\n\n\niPhone\nThe iPhone is Apple's line of smartphones, which run the iOS operating system The first iPhone was unveiled by Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007 Since then, new iPhone models have been released every year When it was introduced, its multi-touch screen was described as \"revolutionary\" and a \"game-changer\" for the mobile phone industry The device has been credited with creating the app economy.\n\n\niPad\nThe iPad is Apple's line of tablets which run iPadOS The first-generation iPad was announced on January 27, 2010 The iPad is mainly marketed for consuming multimedia, creating art, working on documents, videoconferencing, and playing games The iPad lineup consists of several base iPad models, and the smaller iPad Mini, upgraded iPad Air, and high-end iPad Pro Apple has consistently improved the iPad's performance, with the iPad Pro adopting the same M1 and M2 chips as the Mac; but the iPad still receives criticism for its limited OS [181] [182]\n\n\nOther products\nApple makes several other products that it categorizes as \"Wearables, Home and Accessories\" [185] These products include the AirPods line of wireless headphones, Apple TV digital media players, Apple Watch smartwatches, Beats headphones, HomePod smart speakers, and the Vision Pro mixed reality headset As of the end of 2024 [update], this broad line of products

making a concerted effort to expand its service revenues [186]\n\n\nMarketing\nAccording to Steve Jobs, the company's name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm while on a fruitarian diet [188] Apple's first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree It was almost immediately replaced by Rob Janoff's \"rainbow Apple\", the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it [189] This logo has been erroneously referred to as a tribute to Alan Turing, with the bite mark a reference to his method of suicide [190]\n\n\nBranding\nAccording to Steve Jobs, the company's name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm while on a fruitarian diet [188] Apple's first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree It was almost immediately replaced by Rob Janoff's \"rainbow Apple\", the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it [189] This logo has been erroneously referred to as a tribute to Alan Turing, with the bite mark a reference to his method of suicide [190]\n\n\nAdvertising\nApple's first slogan, \"Byte into an Apple\", was coined in the late 1970s [203] From 1997 to 2002, the slogan \"Think different\" was used in advertising campaigns, and is still closely associated with Apple [204] Apple also has slogans for specific product lines—for example, \"iThink, therefore iMac\" was used in 1998 to promote the iMac, [205] and \"Say hello to iPhone\" has been used in iPhone advertisements [206] \"Hello\" was also used to introduce the original Macintosh, Newton, iMac (\"hello (again)\"), and iPod [207]\n\n\nStores\nThe first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs, [88] after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts [89] Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship to consumers, and hired Ron Johnson in 2000 [89] Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997, [211] and opened the first two physical stores in 2001 [88] The media initially speculated that Apple would fail, [90] but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores, and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so [90]\n\n\nMarket power\nOn March 16, 2020, France fined Apple €1.1 billion for colluding with two wholesalers to stifle competition and keep prices high by handicapping independent resellers The arrangement created aligned prices for Apple products such as iPads and personal computers for about half the French retail market According to the French regulators, the abuses occurred between 2005 and 2017 but were first discovered after a complaint by an independent reseller, eBizcuss, in 2012 [216]\n\n\nPrivacy\nApple has publicly taken a pro-privacy stance, actively making privacy-conscious features and settings part of its conferences, promotional campaigns, and public image [222] With its iOS 8 mobile operating system in 2014, the company started encrypting all contents of iOS devices through users' passcodes, making it impossible at the time for the company to provide customer data to law enforcement requests seeking such information [223] With the popularity rise of cloud storage solutions, Apple began a technique in 2016 to do deep learning scans for facial data in photos on the user's local device and encrypting the content before uploading it to Apple's iCloud storage system [224] It also introduced \"differential privacy\", a way to collect crowdsourced data from many users, while keeping individual users anonymous, in a system that Wired described as \"trying to learn as much as possible about a group while learning as little as possible about any individual in it\" [225] Users are explicitly asked if they want to participate, and can actively opt-in or opt-out [226]\n\n\nCorporate affairs\nThe key trends for Apple are, as of each financial year ending September 24: [236] [237]\n\n\nBusiness trends\nThe key trends for Apple are, as of each financial year ending September 24: [236] [237]\n\n\nLeadership\nAs of March 16, 2021 [update], the management of Apple Inc

of Apple were: [253]\n\n\nCorporate culture\nApple is one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of corporate culture Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a Fortune 500 company By the time of the \"1984\" television advertisement, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors [254] According to a 2011 report in Fortune, this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation [255] In a 2017 interview, Wozniak credited watching Star Trek and attending Star Trek conventions in his youth as inspiration for co-founding Apple [256]\n\n\nOffices\nApple Inc.'s world corporate headquarters are located in Cupertino, in the middle of California's Silicon Valley, at Apple Park, a massive circular groundscraper building with a circumference of one mile (1.6 km) The building opened in April 2017 and houses more than 12,000 employees Apple co-founder Steve Jobs wanted Apple Park to look less like a business park and more like a nature refuge, and personally appeared before the Cupertino City Council in June 2011 to make the proposal, in his final public appearance before his death.\n\n\nLitigation\nApple has been a participant in various legal proceedings and claims since it began operation [286] In particular, Apple is known for and promotes itself as actively and aggressively enforcing its intellectual property interests Some litigation examples include Apple v Samsung, Apple v Microsoft, Motorola Mobility v Apple Inc., and Apple Corps v Apple Computer Apple has also had to defend itself against charges on numerous occasions of violating intellectual property rights Most have been dismissed in the courts as shell companies known as patent trolls, with no evidence of actual use of patents in question [287] On December 21, 2016, Nokia announced that in the U.S and Germany, it has filed a suit against Apple, claiming that the latter's products infringe on Nokia's patents [288]\n\n\nFinances\nAs of 2023 [update], Apple is the world's largest technology company by revenue, with US$394.33 billion; [292] the world's largest technology company by total assets; [293] the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales; [294] and the world's largest mobile phone manufacturer [295]\n\n\nTaxes\nApple has created subsidiaries in low-tax places such as Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and the British Virgin Islands to cut the taxes it pays around the world According to The New York Times, in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes In the late 1980s, Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the \"Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich\", which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean [310] [311]\n\n\nCharity\nApple is a partner of Product Red, a fundraising campaign for AIDS charity In November 2014, Apple arranged for all App Store revenue in a two-week period to go to the fundraiser, [322] generating more than US$20 million, [323] and in March 2017, it released an iPhone 7 with a red color finish [324]\n\n\nEnvironment\nApple Energy, LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apple Inc that sells solar energy As of June 6, 2016 [update], Apple's solar farms in California and Nevada have been declared to provide 217.9 megawatts of solar generation capacity [338] Apple has received regulatory approval to construct a landfill gas energy plant in North Carolina to use the methane emissions to generate electricity [339] Apple's North Carolina data center is already powered entirely by renewable sources [340]\n\n\nApple Energy\nApple Energy, LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apple Inc that sells solar energy As of June 6, 2016 [update], Apple's solar farms in California and Nevada have been declared to provide 217.9 megawatts of solar generation capacity [338] Apple has received regulatory approval to construct a landfill gas energy plant in North Carolina to use the methane emissions to generate electricity [339] Apple's North Carolina data center is already powered entirely by renewable sources [340]\n\n\nEnergy and resources\nIn 2010, Climate Counts, a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts Apple in their top category \"Striding\" [341] This was an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of 100, which placed the company last among electronics companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a \"stuck icon\", adding that Apple at the time was \"a choice to avoid for the climate-conscious consumer\" [342]\n\n\nToxins\nFollowing further campaigns by Greenpeace, [359] in 2008, Apple became the first electronics manufacturer to eliminate all polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in its complete product line [360] In June 2007, Apple began replacing the cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlit LCD displays in its computers with mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays and arsenic-free glass, starting with the upgraded MacBook Pro [361] [362] [363] [364] Apple offers comprehensive and transparent information about the CO2e, emissions, materials, and electrical usage concerning every product they currently produce or have sold in the past (and which they have enough data needed to produce the report), in their portfolio on their homepage Allowing consumers to make informed purchasing decisions on the products they offer for sale [365] In June 2009, Apple's iPhone 3GS was free of PVC, arsenic, and BFRs [361] [366] Since 2009, all Apple products have mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays, arsenic-free glass, and non-PVC cables [367] All Apple products have EPEAT Gold status and beat the latest Energy Star guidelines in each product's respective regulatory category [361] [368]\n\n\nGreen bonds\nIn February 2016, Apple issued a US$1.5 billion green bond (climate bond), the first ever of its kind by a U.S tech company The green bond proceeds are dedicated to the financing of environmental projects [372]\n\n\nSupply chain\nApple products were made in America in Apple-owned factories until the late 1990s; however, as a result of outsourcing initiatives in the 2000s, almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad According to a report by The New York Times, Apple insiders \"believe the vast scale of overseas factories, as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers, have so outpaced their American counterparts that 'Made in the U.S.A.' is no longer a viable option for most Apple products\" [373]\n\n\nWorker organizations\nApple directly employs 147,000 workers including 25,000 corporate employees in Apple Park and across Silicon Valley [391] [392] The vast majority of its employees work at the over 500 retail Apple Stores globally [393] Apple relies on a larger, outsourced workforce for manufacturing, particularly in China where Apple directly employs 10,000 workers across its retail and corporate divisions In addition, one further million workers are contracted by Apple's suppliers to assemble Apple products, including Foxconn and Pegatron [394] Zhengzhou Technology Park alone employs 350,000 Chinese workers in Zhengzhou to exclusively work on the iPhone [395] As of 2021 [update], Apple uses hardware components from 43 different countries [396] The majority of assembling is done by Taiwanese original design manufacturer firms Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron and Compal Electronics in factories primarily located inside China, [397] and, to a lesser extent, Foxconn plants in Brazil, [398] and India [399]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Apple Inc.**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nApple Inc. is a multinational technology company that designs, manufactures, and markets consumer electronics, computer software, and online services. The company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne, and is headquartered in Cupertino, California. Apple is one of the world's largest technology companies by revenue, with a market capitalization of over $2 trillion.\n\n**History**\n\n**1976-1980: Founding and Incorporation**\n\nApple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne as a partnership. The company's first product was the Apple I, a computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak. To finance its creation, Jobs sold his Volkswagen Bus, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator. Neither received the full selling price, but in total earned $1,300 (equivalent to $7,000 in 2023).\n\n**1980-1990: Success with Macintosh**\n\nIn December 1979, Steve Jobs and Apple employees, including Jef Raskin, visited Xerox PARC, where they observed the Xerox Alto, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI). Apple subsequently negotiated access to PARC's technology, leading to Apple's option to buy shares at a preferential rate. This visit influenced Jobs to implement a GUI in Apple's products, starting with the Apple Lisa. Despite being pioneering as a mass-marketed GUI computer, the Lisa suffered from high costs and limited software options, leading to commercial failure.\n\n**1990-1997: Decline and Restructuring**\n\nThe company pivoted strategy and, in October 1990, introduced three lower-cost models: the Macintosh Classic, the Macintosh LC, and the Macintosh IIsi, all of which generated significant sales due to pent-up demand. In 1991, Apple introduced the hugely successful PowerBook with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops. The same year, Apple introduced System 7, a major upgrade to the Macintosh operating system, adding color to the interface and introducing new networking capabilities.\n\n**1997-2007: Return to Profitability**\n\nThe NeXT acquisition was finalized on February 9, 1997, and the board brought Jobs back to Apple as an advisor. On July 9, 1997, Jobs staged a boardroom coup that resulted in Amelio's resignation after overseeing a three-year record-low stock price and crippling financial losses. The board named Jobs as interim CEO, and he immediately reviewed the product lineup. Jobs canceled 70% of models, ending 3,000 jobs and paring to the core of its computer offerings.\n\n**2007-2011: Success with Mobile Devices**\n\nDuring his keynote speech at the Macworld Expo on January 9, 2007, Jobs announced the renaming of Apple Computer, Inc to Apple Inc, because the company had broadened its focus from computers to consumer electronics. This event also saw the announcement of the iPhone and the Apple TV. The company sold 270,000 first-generation iPhones during the first 30 hours of sales, and the device was called \"a game changer for the industry.\"\n\n**2011-Present: Post-Jobs Era, Tim Cook**\n\nOn October 5, 2011, Steve Jobs died, marking the end of an era for Apple. The next major product announcement by Apple was on January 19, 2012, when Apple's Phil Schiller introduced iBooks Textbooks for iOS and iBook Author for Mac OS X in New York City. Jobs stated in his biography that he wanted to reinvent the textbook industry and education.\n\n**Products**\n\nSince the company's founding and into the early 2000s, Apple primarily sold computers, which are marketed as Macintosh. Since then, the company has expanded its product categories to include various portable devices, starting with the now-discontinued iPod (2001), and later with the iPhone (2007) and iPad (2010). Apple also sells several other products that it categorizes as \"Wearables, Home and Accessories,\" such as the Apple Watch, Apple TV, AirPods, HomePod, and Vision Pro.\n\n**Mac**\n\nThe Mac is Apple's line of personal computers that use the company's proprietary macOS operating system. Personal computers were Apple's original business line, but as of the end of 2024, they account for only about eight percent of the company's revenue.\n\n**iPhone**\n\nThe iPhone is Apple's line of smartphones, which run the iOS operating system. The first iPhone was unveiled by Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007. Since then, new iPhone models have been released every year. When it was introduced, its multi-touch screen was described as \"revolutionary\" and a \"game-changer\" for the mobile phone industry.\n\n**iPad**\n\nThe iPad is Apple's line of tablets, which run iPadOS. The first-generation iPad was announced on January 27, 2010. The iPad is mainly marketed for consuming multimedia, creating art, working on documents, videoconferencing, and playing games.\n\n**Other Products**\n\nApple makes several other products that it categorizes as \"Wearables, Home and Accessories.\" These products include the AirPods line of wireless headphones, Apple TV digital media players, Apple Watch smartwatches, Beats headphones, HomePod smart speakers, and the Vision Pro mixed reality headset.\n\n**Services**\n\nApple offers a broad line of services, including advertising in the App Store and Apple News app, the AppleCare+ extended warranty plan, the iCloud+ cloud-based data storage service, payment services through the Apple Card credit card and the Apple Pay processing platform, digital content services including Apple Books, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+, and the iTunes Store.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nAccording to Steve Jobs, the company's name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm while on a fruitarian diet. Apple's first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. It was almost immediately replaced by Rob Janoff's \"rainbow Apple,\" the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it.\n\n**Branding**\n\nApple's branding has been closely associated with its products and services. The company's logo, which features a stylized apple with a bite taken out of it, is one of the most recognizable logos in the world.\n\n**Advertising**\n\nApple's first slogan, \"Byte into an Apple,\" was coined in the late 1970s.

The media initially speculated that Apple would fail, but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores, and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so.\n\n**Market Power**\n\nOn March 16, 2020, France fined Apple €1.1 billion for colluding with two wholesalers to stifle competition and keep prices high by handicapping independent resellers. The arrangement created aligned prices for Apple products such as iPads and personal computers for about half the French retail market.

consistently improved the iPad's performance, with the iPad Pro adopting the same M1 and M2 chips as the Mac; but the iPad still receives criticism for its limited OS [181] [182]\n\n\nOther products\nApple makes several other products that it categorizes as \"Wearables, Home and Accessories\" [185] These products include the AirPods line of wireless headphones, Apple TV digital media players, Apple Watch smartwatches, Beats headphones, HomePod smart speakers, and the Vision Pro mixed reality headset As of the end of 2024 [update], this broad line of products comprises about ten percent of the company's revenues [1]\n\n\nServices\nApple offers a broad line of services, including advertising in the App Store and Apple News app, the AppleCare+ extended warranty plan, the iCloud+ cloud-based data storage service, payment services through the Apple Card credit card and the Apple Pay processing platform, digital content services including Apple Books, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+, and the iTunes Store As of the end of 2024 [update], services comprise about 26% of the company's revenue [1] In 2019, Apple announced it would be making a concerted effort to expand its service revenues [186]\n\n\nMarketing\nAccording to Steve Jobs, the company's name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm while on a fruitarian diet [188] Apple's first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree It was almost immediately replaced by Rob Janoff's \"rainbow Apple\", the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it [189] This logo has been erroneously referred to as a tribute to Alan Turing, with the bite mark a reference to his method of suicide [190]\n\n\nBranding\nAccording to Steve Jobs, the company's name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm while on a fruitarian diet [188] Apple's first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree It was almost immediately replaced by Rob Janoff's \"rainbow Apple\", the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it [189] This logo has been erroneously referred to as a tribute to Alan Turing, with the bite mark a reference to his method of suicide [190]\n\n\nAdvertising\nApple's first slogan, \"Byte into an Apple\", was coined in the late 1970s [203] From 1997 to 2002, the slogan \"Think different\" was used in advertising campaigns, and is still closely associated with Apple [204] Apple also has slogans for specific product lines—for example, \"iThink, therefore iMac\" was used in 1998 to promote the iMac, [205] and \"Say hello to iPhone\" has been used in iPhone advertisements [206] \"Hello\" was also used to introduce the original Macintosh, Newton, iMac (\"hello (again)\"), and iPod [207]\n\n\nStores\nThe first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs, [88] after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts [89] Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship to consumers, and hired Ron Johnson in 2000 [89] Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997, [211] and opened the first two physical stores in 2001 [88] The media initially speculated that Apple would fail, [90] but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores, and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so [90]\n\n\nMarket power\nOn March 16, 2020, France fined Apple €1.1 billion for colluding with two wholesalers to stifle competition and keep prices high by handicapping independent resellers The arrangement created aligned prices for Apple products such as iPads and personal computers for about half the French retail market According to the French regulators, the abuses occurred between 2005 and 2017 but were first discovered after a complaint by an independent reseller, eBizcuss, in 2012 [216]\n\n\nPrivacy\nApple has publicly taken a pro-privacy stance, actively making privacy-conscious features and settings part of its conferences, promotional campaigns, and public image [222] With its iOS 8 mobile operating system in 2014, the company started encrypting all contents of iOS devices through users' passcodes, making it impossible at the time for the company to provide customer data to law enforcement requests seeking such information [223] With the popularity rise of cloud storage solutions, Apple began a technique in 2016 to do deep learning scans for facial data in photos on the user's local device and encrypting the content before uploading it to Apple's iCloud storage system [224] It also introduced \"differential privacy\", a way to collect crowdsourced data from many users, while keeping individual users anonymous, in a system that Wired described as \"trying to learn as much as possible about a group while learning as little as possible about any individual in it\" [225] Users are explicitly asked if they want to participate, and can actively opt-in or opt-out [226]\n\n\nCorporate affairs\nThe key trends for Apple are, as of each financial year ending September 24: [236] [237]\n\n\nBusiness trends\nThe key trends for Apple are, as of each financial year ending September 24: [236] [237]\n\n\nLeadership\nAs of March 16, 2021 [update], the management of Apple Inc

of Apple were: [253]\n\n\nCorporate culture\nApple is one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of corporate culture Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a Fortune 500 company By the time of the \"1984\" television advertisement, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors [254] According to a 2011 report in Fortune, this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation [255] In a 2017 interview, Wozniak credited watching Star Trek and attending Star Trek conventions in his youth as inspiration for co-founding Apple [256]\n\n\nOffices\nApple Inc.'s world corporate headquarters are located in Cupertino, in the middle of California's Silicon Valley, at Apple Park, a massive circular groundscraper building with a circumference of one mile (1.6 km) The building opened in April 2017 and houses more than 12,000 employees Apple co-founder Steve Jobs wanted Apple Park to look less like a business park and more like a nature refuge, and personally appeared before the Cupertino City Council in June 2011 to make the proposal, in his final public appearance before his death.\n\n\nLitigation\nApple has been a participant in various legal proceedings and claims since it began operation [286] In particular, Apple is known for and promotes itself as actively and aggressively enforcing its intellectual property interests Some litigation examples include Apple v Samsung, Apple v Microsoft, Motorola Mobility v Apple Inc., and Apple Corps v Apple Computer Apple has also had to defend itself against charges on numerous occasions of violating intellectual property rights Most have been dismissed in the courts as shell companies known as patent trolls, with no evidence of actual use of patents in question [287] On December 21, 2016, Nokia announced that in the U.S and Germany, it has filed a suit against Apple, claiming that the latter's products infringe on Nokia's patents [288]\n\n\nFinances\nAs of 2023 [update], Apple is the world's largest technology company by revenue, with US$394.33 billion; [292] the world's largest technology company by total assets; [293] the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales; [294] and the world's largest mobile phone manufacturer [295]\n\n\nTaxes\nApple has created subsidiaries in low-tax places such as Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and the British Virgin Islands to cut the taxes it pays around the world According to The New York Times, in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes In the late 1980s, Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the \"Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich\", which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean [310] [311]\n\n\nCharity\nApple is a partner of Product Red, a fundraising campaign for AIDS charity In November 2014, Apple arranged for all App Store revenue in a two-week period to go to the fundraiser, [322] generating more than US$20 million, [323] and in March 2017, it released an iPhone 7 with a red color finish [324]\n\n\nEnvironment\nApple Energy, LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apple Inc that sells solar energy As of June 6, 2016 [update], Apple's solar farms in California and Nevada have been declared to provide 217.9 megawatts of solar generation capacity [338] Apple has received regulatory approval to construct a landfill gas energy plant in North Carolina to use the methane emissions to generate electricity [339] Apple's North Carolina data center is already powered entirely by renewable sources [340]\n\n\nApple Energy\nApple Energy, LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of

received regulatory approval to construct a landfill gas energy plant in North Carolina to use the methane emissions to generate electricity [339] Apple's North Carolina data center is already powered entirely by renewable sources [340]\n\n\nEnergy and resources\nIn 2010, Climate Counts, a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts Apple in their top category \"Striding\" [341] This was an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of 100, which placed the company last among electronics companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a \"stuck icon\", adding that Apple at the time was \"a choice to avoid for the climate-conscious consumer\" [342]\n\n\nToxins\nFollowing further campaigns by Greenpeace, [359] in 2008, Apple became the first electronics manufacturer to eliminate all polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in its complete product line [360] In June 2007, Apple began replacing the cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlit LCD displays in its computers with mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays and arsenic-free glass, starting with the upgraded MacBook Pro [361] [362] [363] [364] Apple offers comprehensive and transparent information about the CO2e, emissions, materials, and electrical usage concerning every product they currently produce or have sold in the past (and which they have enough data needed to produce the report), in their portfolio on their homepage Allowing consumers to make informed purchasing decisions on the products they offer for sale [365] In June 2009, Apple's iPhone 3GS was free of PVC, arsenic, and BFRs [361] [366] Since 2009, all Apple products have mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays, arsenic-free glass, and non-PVC cables [367] All Apple products have EPEAT Gold status and beat the latest Energy Star guidelines in each product's respective regulatory category [361] [368]\n\n\nGreen bonds\nIn February 2016, Apple issued a US$1.5 billion green bond (climate bond), the first ever of its kind by a U.S tech company The green bond proceeds are dedicated to the financing of environmental projects [372]\n\n\nSupply chain\nApple products were made in America in Apple-owned factories until the late 1990s; however, as a result of outsourcing initiatives in the 2000s, almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad According to a report by The New York Times, Apple insiders \"believe the vast scale of overseas factories, as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers, have so outpaced their American counterparts that 'Made in the U.S.A.' is no longer a viable option for most Apple products\" [373]\n\n\nWorker organizations\nApple directly employs 147,000 workers including 25,000 corporate employees in Apple Park and across Silicon Valley [391] [392] The vast majority of its employees work at the over 500 retail Apple Stores globally [393] Apple relies on a larger, outsourced workforce for manufacturing, particularly in China where Apple directly employs 10,000 workers across its retail and corporate divisions In addition, one further million workers are contracted by Apple's suppliers to assemble Apple products, including Foxconn and Pegatron [394] Zhengzhou Technology Park alone employs 350,000 Chinese workers in Zhengzhou to exclusively work on the iPhone [395] As of 2021 [update], Apple uses hardware components from 43 different countries [396] The majority of assembling is done by Taiwanese original design manufacturer firms Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron and Compal Electronics in factories primarily located inside China, [397] and, to a lesser extent, Foxconn plants in Brazil, [398] and India [399]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

an event to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the historic landing [6] The Columbus Obelisk in Baltimore was erected in 1792.\n\n\nHistory\nThe first Columbus Day celebration took place on October 12, 1792, when the Columbian Order of New York, better known as Tammany Hall, held an event to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the historic landing [6] The Columbus Obelisk in Baltimore was erected in 1792.\n\n\nLocalization\nActual observance varies in different parts of the United States, ranging from large-scale parades and events to complete nonobservance Most states do not celebrate Columbus Day as an official state holiday [28]  Some mark it as a \"Day of Observance\" or \"Recognition” Most states that celebrate Columbus Day will close state services, while others operate as normal [29]\n\n\nNonobservance\nDespite Columbus Day being a national holiday and a celebration of Italian heritage, the celebration of Columbus Day in the United States began to decline at the end of the 20th century, although Americans continue to celebrate it [36] [37] [38] The District of Columbia [39] and the states of Colorado, [11] Hawaii, [40] [41] Alaska, [42] [43] Vermont, [44] South Dakota, [45] New Mexico, [46] Maine, [47] Minnesota, [48] and parts of California, including, for example, Los Angeles County, [49] do not recognize it and have each replaced it with celebrations of Indigenous Peoples' Day (in Hawaii, \"Discoverers' Day\", in South Dakota, \"Native American Day\" [38]) or other holidays In the states of Delaware, Oregon and Washington, Columbus Day is not an official holiday [50] [51]\n\n\nLatin American observance\nThe date Columbus arrived in the Americas is celebrated in some countries of Latin America The most common name for the celebration in Spanish (including some Latin American communities [70] in the United States) is the Día de la Raza (\"day of the race\" or the \"day of the  [Hispanic] people\"), commemorating the first encounters of Europeans and the Native Americans The day was first celebrated in Argentina in 1917, in Venezuela and Colombia in 1921, in Chile in 1922, and in Mexico, it was first celebrated in 1928 The day was also celebrated under this title in Spain until 1957, when it was changed to the Día de la Hispanidad (\"Hispanicity Day\"), and in Venezuela, it was celebrated under this title until 2002, when it was changed to the Día de la Resistencia Indígena (Day of Indigenous Resistance) Originally conceived of as a celebration of Hispanic influence in the Americas, as evidenced by the complementary celebrations in Spain and Latin America, Día de la Raza has come to be seen by nationalist activists throughout Latin America as a counter to Columbus Day – a celebration of the native races and cultures and their resistance to the arrival of Europeans in the Americas [citation needed]\n\n\nArgentina\nThe Day of the Race was established in Argentina in 1916 by a decree of President Hipólito Yrigoyen The name was changed to \"Day of Respect of Cultural Diversity\" by a presidential decree in 2010 issued by President Cristina Kirchner [72] The statue of Columbus was removed from its original position near the Casa Rosada and replaced by one of Juana Azurduy, a patriot and leader in the struggle for independence who had indigenous ancestors [citation needed]\n\n\nColombia\nColombia, whose name originated from Columbus himself, celebrates El día de la Raza y de la Hispanidad (meaning \"Day of the Race and Hispanicity\"), and is taken as an opportunity to celebrate the encounter of \"the two worlds\" and to reflect on the richness that the racial diversity has brought to the culture In 2021 the Ministry of Culture changed the name of the holiday to ‘Día de la Diversidad Étnica y Cultural de la Nación Colombiana (meaning \"Day of Ethnical and Cultural Diversity of the Colombian nation\") [73]\n\n\nPeru\nIn Peru, it was known as Día del descubrimiento de América (\"Day of the discovery of America\") Since 2009, it has been celebrated as Día de los pueblos originarios y el diálogo intercultural (Indigenous Peoples and Intercultural Dialogue Day) [74]\n\n\nVenezuela\nBetween 1921 and 2002, Venezuela celebrated Día de la Raza along with many other Latin American nations The original holiday was officially established in 1921 under President Juan Vicente Gómez In 2002, under President Hugo Chávez, the holiday was changed to Día de la Resistencia Indígena (Day of Indigenous Resistance) to commemorate the Indigenous peoples' resistance to European settlement [75]\n\n\nCosta Rica\nOn September 21, 1994, Costa Rica changed the official holiday from Día de la Raza to Día del Encuentro de las Culturas (Day of the Encounter of Cultures) to recognize the mix of European, Native American (autochthonous populations), African and Asian cultures that constitute modern Costa Rican (and Latin American) culture and ethnicity In accordance to the Costa Rican labor law, the holiday is observed on October 12 Should this date coincide with a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday, the employer shall agree that said holiday be postponed to the following Monday [76] In 2020, Costa Ricans eliminated this holiday, which was under debate in years prior Hence, in exchange Costa Rica now celebrates the 'Military Abolition Day' on December 1 [77]\n\n\nEl Salvador\nIn June 1915, the official holiday of 'Fiesta de la Raza' was established, with October 12 being the date of the national holiday Presently, since October 12, 2021, the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador abolished the previous national Fiesta de la Raza holiday, \"  [to] vindicate the origin and identity of indigenous peoples who were forgotten by previous governments, who for decades celebrated Race Day as a positive event and who never adopted mechanisms to enhance human rights\" [78] The holiday is no longer celebrated officially.\n\n\nMexico\nIn Mexico, the date was known as Columbus Day or Day of the Race On December 18, 2020, by decree of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the name of October 12 was changed to \"Day of the Pluricultural Nation\" [79] [80] The statue of Columbus along Mexico City's Paseo de la Reforma was removed and replaced with a replica of The Young Woman of Amajac, a sculpture depicting an Indigenous woman [81] [82]\n\n\nCaribbean observance\nOnly a handful of Caribbean countries observe holidays related to Columbus Day In Belize, October 12 is celebrated as Day of the Americas or Pan American Day [83] [84] [85] In the Bahamas, it was formerly known as Discovery Day, until 2001 when it was replaced by National Heroes Day In 1937, Cuban President Federico Laredo Brú (1936–1940) spoke to the nation and countries of America in Cuba on October 12 commemorating Christopher Columbus's voyage to the New World Federico Laredo Brú spoke about Columbus's impact on the land and the future of its settlement He ended his speech with venerating Christopher Columbus's efforts to colonize and establish settlements along the new front and the pride of one's nation He added \"Por mi raza hablo mi espiritu,\" which translates to \"For my race my spirit called,\" to support the political infrastructure at the time [86]\n\n\nColumbus's legacy\nIn December 1937, Cuban president Federico Laredo Brú and Dominican Republic president Rafael Trujillo ordered a crew of aviators to travel through Latin America collecting funds from large capital cities for a monumental light house in the Dominican Republic The exploration Escuadrilla Binacional Pro Faro de Colón was inspired by Columbus's journey across the North Atlantic Ocean to America The expedition consisted of three  Stinson Reliant SR-9s  borrowed from the Cuban Air Force – named Santa María, Niña and Pinta after the vessels commanded by Columbus – and a Curtiss Wright CW-19R from the Dominican military aviation named Colon after Columbus On December 15, after visiting a majority of South America, their flight to the Peruvian capital Lima was hampered by an unexpected sandstorm Two planes (Colon and La Pinta) were forced to land in Pisco and Niña disappeared in the storm The Santa Maria was the only plane to reach Lima as planned, landing at Las Palmas on the day of the storm After extensive searches, Niña radioed their whereabouts after their radio was damaged in the storm The aircraft restrategized in Las Palmas, and on December 29 their expedition took off from El Techo airport in Bogotá en route to El Guabito airport in Cali Later that day, the crew flew into an unexpected storm over the Valley of Cauca With minimal visibility and poor navigation, Niña, La Pinta, and Santa Maria crashed into high

Columbus in Spain was as early as 1642 when the city of Zaragoza designated the Virgen del Pilar (Our Lady of the Pillar) as symbol of the Hispanidad (Hispanicity) on the date of the Spanish expedition's arrival to the New World [93] This holiday was declared a religious feast day throughout the Spanish Empire in 1730 [94]\nIn 1892, the 12 of October was declared a one-time national day in commemoration of the 4th centenary of the Discovery of America and the perpetuation of the festivity was then first considered The Spanish government suggested other nations (Hispanic American

has been celebrated as a national day since 1918 under different names like \"Día de la Hispanidad\" or \"Dia de la Raza\", due to changes of political regimes in the 20th century The national day

a national holiday [96] In 1987 the name was changed again to Fiesta Nacional and October 12 became one of two national celebrations, along with Constitution Day on December 6, as part of a compromise

Since 2000, October 12 has also been Spain's Day of the Armed Forces, celebrated each year with a military parade in Madrid [97] The holiday is widely celebrated in Spain with official and cultural events throughout the country Shops and businesses are closed as with other bank holidays The observation is enhanced with the feast day of Our Lady of the Pillar (Fiestas del Pilar), the so-called Mother of Hispanidad, [97] and of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Extremadura (Santa María de Guadalupe) (appointed Queen of Hispanicity in 1928 by the Vatican) from Guadalupe, Caceres, whose Monastery was

United States that commemorates the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Americas in 1492. The holiday is observed on the second Monday in October and has been celebrated since 1792. While it is a federal holiday, its observance varies across the United States, with some states and cities choosing to celebrate it as a day of observance or recognition. In recent years, there has been a growing movement to replace Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples' Day, which honors the histories and contributions of Native American communities.\n\n**American Observance**\n\nThe first Columbus Day celebration took place on October 12, 1792, when the Columbian Order of New York, better known as Tammany Hall, held an event to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the historic landing. The Columbus Obelisk in Baltimore was erected in 1792.\n\n**History**\n\nThe first Columbus Day celebration took place on October 12, 1792, when the Columbian Order of New York, better known as Tammany Hall, held an event to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the historic landing. The Columbus Obelisk in Baltimore was erected in 1792.\n\n**Localization**\n\nActual observance varies in different parts of the United States, ranging from large-scale parades and events to complete nonobservance. Most states do not celebrate Columbus Day as an official state holiday. Some mark it as a \"Day of Observance\" or \"Recognition.\" Most states that celebrate Columbus Day will close state services, while others operate as normal.\n\n**Nonobservance**\n\nDespite Columbus Day being a national holiday and a celebration of Italian heritage, the celebration of Columbus Day in the United States began to decline at the end of the 20th century. Although Americans continue to celebrate it, the District of Columbia and the states of Colorado, Hawaii, Alaska, Vermont, South Dakota, New Mexico, Maine, Minnesota, and parts of California, including Los Angeles County, do not recognize it and have each replaced it with celebrations of Indigenous Peoples' Day (in Hawaii, \"Discoverers' Day,\" in South Dakota, \"Native American Day\") or other holidays.\n\n**Latin American Observance**\n\nThe date Columbus arrived in the Americas is celebrated in some countries of Latin America. The most common name for the celebration in Spanish (including some Latin American communities in the United States) is the Día de la Raza (\"day of the race\" or the \"day of the Hispanic people\"), commemorating the first encounters of Europeans and the Native Americans.\n\n**Argentina**\n\nThe Day of the Race was established in Argentina in 1916 by a decree of President Hipólito Yrigoyen. The name was changed to \"Day of Respect of Cultural Diversity\" by a presidential decree in 2010 issued by President Cristina Kirchner. The statue of Columbus was removed from its original position near the Casa Rosada and replaced by one of Juana Azurduy, a patriot and leader in the struggle for independence who had indigenous ancestors.\n\n**Colombia**\n\nColombia, whose name originated from Columbus himself, celebrates El día de la Raza y de la Hispanidad (meaning \"Day of the Race and Hispanicity\"), and is taken as an opportunity to celebrate the encounter of \"the two worlds\" and to reflect on the richness that the racial diversity has brought to the culture. In 2021 the Ministry of Culture changed the name of the holiday to ‘Día de la Diversidad Étnica y Cultural de la Nación Colombiana (meaning \"Day of Ethnical and Cultural Diversity of the Colombian nation\").\n\n**Peru**\n\nIn Peru, it was known as Día del descubrimiento de América (\"Day of the discovery of America\"). Since 2009, it has been celebrated as Día de los pueblos originarios y el diálogo intercultural (Indigenous Peoples and Intercultural Dialogue Day).\n\n**Venezuela**\n\nBetween 1921 and 2002, Venezuela celebrated Día de la Raza along with many other Latin American nations. The original holiday was officially established in 1921 under President Juan Vicente Gómez. In 2002, under President Hugo Chávez, the holiday was changed to Día de la Resistencia Indígena (Day of Indigenous Resistance) to commemorate the Indigenous peoples' resistance to European settlement.\n\n**Costa Rica**\n\nOn September 21, 1994, Costa Rica changed the official holiday from Día de la Raza to Día del Encuentro de las Culturas (Day of the Encounter of Cultures) to recognize the mix of European, Native American (autochthonous populations), African, and Asian cultures that constitute modern Costa Rican (and Latin American) culture and ethnicity. In 2020, Costa Ricans eliminated this holiday, which was under debate in years prior.\n\n**El Salvador**\n\nIn June 1915, the official holiday of 'Fiesta de la Raza' was established, with October 12 being the date of the national holiday. Presently, since October 12, 2021, the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador abolished the previous national Fiesta de la Raza holiday.\n\n**Mexico**\n\nIn Mexico, the date was known as Columbus Day or Day of the Race. On December 18, 2020, by decree of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the name of October 12 was changed to \"Day of the Pluricultural Nation.\" The statue of Columbus along Mexico City's Paseo de la Reforma was removed and replaced with a replica of The Young Woman of Amajac, a sculpture depicting an Indigenous woman.\n\n**Caribbean Observance**\n\nOnly a handful of Caribbean countries observe holidays related to Columbus Day. In Belize, October 12 is celebrated as Day of the Americas or Pan American Day. In the Bahamas, it was formerly known as Discovery Day, until 2001 when it was replaced by National Heroes Day.\n\n**Columbus's Legacy**\n\nIn December 1937, Cuban president Federico Laredo Brú and Dominican Republic president Rafael Trujillo ordered a crew of aviators to travel through Latin America collecting funds for a monumental lighthouse in the Dominican Republic. The exploration Escuadrilla Binacional Pro Faro de Colón was inspired by Columbus's journey across the North Atlantic Ocean to America.\n\n**European Observance**\n\nSince the 18th century, many Italian communities in the Americas have observed the Discovery of the New World as a celebration of their heritage, despite Italy not existing as a unified country when Columbus was born, and despite his public renunciation of his Genovese nationality to swear allegiance to the King of Spain.\n\n**Spain**\n\nThe first celebration of the Discovery of the Américas by Columbus in Spain was as early as 1642 when the city of Zaragoza designated the Virgen del Pilar (Our Lady of the Pillar) as symbol of the Hispanidad (Hispanicity) on the date of the Spanish expedition's arrival to the New World.

collecting funds from large capital cities for a monumental light house in the Dominican Republic The exploration Escuadrilla Binacional Pro Faro de Colón was inspired by Columbus's journey across the North Atlantic Ocean to America The expedition consisted of three  Stinson Reliant SR-9s  borrowed from the Cuban Air Force – named Santa María, Niña and Pinta after the vessels commanded by Columbus – and a Curtiss Wright CW-19R from the Dominican military aviation named Colon after Columbus On December 15, after visiting a majority of South America, their flight to the Peruvian capital Lima was hampered by an unexpected sandstorm Two planes (Colon and La Pinta) were forced to land in Pisco and Niña disappeared in the storm The Santa Maria was the only plane to reach Lima as planned, landing at Las Palmas on the day of the storm After extensive searches, Niña radioed their whereabouts after their radio was damaged in the storm The aircraft restrategized in Las Palmas, and on December 29 their expedition took off from El Techo airport in Bogotá en route to El Guabito airport in Cali Later that day, the crew flew into an unexpected storm over the Valley of Cauca With minimal visibility and poor navigation, Niña, La Pinta, and Santa Maria crashed into high mountains, while Colon, unaware of the other aircraft, flew over the storm and safely made it to Panama City The plane is

investigation in 2006, the police concluded that The Pirate Bay brings in 1.2 million kronor ($169,000) per year from advertisements [86] The prosecution estimated in the 2009 trial from emails and screenshots that the advertisements pay over 10 million kronor ($1.4 million) a year, [87] but the indictment used the estimate from the police investigation [88] The lawyers of the site's administrators counted the 2006 revenue closer to 725,000 kronor ($102,000) [89] The verdict of the first trial, however, quoted the estimate from the preliminary investigation [90]\n\n\nCryptocurrency mining and tokens\nIn 2017, The Pirate Bay embedded scripts on its website that would consume resources on visitors' computers in order to mine the Monero cryptocurrency Visitors were initially not informed that these scripts had been added [96] After negative feedback, the operators published an announcement stating that it was a test to see if it could replace advertisements [97] The mining script appeared and disappeared from the website repeatedly over the following months through 2018 [98] In 2021 The Pirate Bay embarked in a short lived creation of their own crypto tokens, which were rapidly abandoned  [99]\n\n\nFee\nAccording to the site's usage policy, it reserves the right to charge commercial policy violators \"a basic fee of €5,000 plus bandwidth and other costs that may arise due to the violation\" [100] Sunde accused Swedish book publishers, who scraped the site for information about copyrighted books, of violating the usage policy, and asserted TPB's copyright on its database [101]\n\n\nProjects\nThe team behind The Pirate Bay has worked on several websites and software projects of varying degrees of permanence In 2007, BayImg, an image hosting website similar to TinyPic went online in June [103] [104] Pre-publication images posted to BayImg became part of a legal battle when Conde Nast's network was later allegedly hacked [105] [106] In July, \"within hours after Ingmar Bergman's death\", BergmanBits.com was launched, listing torrents for the director's films, [103] [107] [108] online until mid-2008 [109] In August, The Pirate Bay relaunched the BitTorrent website Suprnova.org to perform the same functions as The Pirate Bay, with different torrent trackers, but the site languished; the domain was returned to its original owner in August 2010, and it now redirects to TorrentFreak.tv [110] [111] Suprbay.org was introduced in August as the official forum for ThePirateBay.org and the various sites connected to it Users can request reseeding of torrents, or report malware within torrent files or illegal material on ThePirateBay.org [112] [113]\n\n\nPurchases\nIn January 2007, when the micronation of Sealand was put up for sale, the ACFI and The Pirate Bay tried to buy it The Sealand government, however, did not want to be involved with The Pirate Bay, as it was their opinion that file sharing represented \"theft of proprietary rights\" [142] [143] A new plan was formed to buy an island instead, but this too was never implemented, despite the website having raised US$25,000 (€15,000) in donations for this cause [144]\n\n\nCryptocurrency\nOn 12 May 2021, The Pirate Bay launched Pirate Token, a BEP-20 token, to be used to sustain its community and develop tools for the website [147] [148]\n\n\nIncidents\nOn 31 May 2006, a raid against The Pirate Bay and people involved with the website took place as ordered by Swedish judge Tomas Norström, later the presiding judge of the 2009 trial, prompted by allegations of copyright violations Police officers shut down the website and confiscated its servers, as well as all other servers hosted by The Pirate Bay's Internet service provider, PRQ The company is owned by two operators of The Pirate Bay Three people – Neij, Svartholm and Mikael Viborg – were held by the police for questioning, but were released later that evening [149] All servers in the room were seized, including those running the website of Piratbyrån, an independent organisation fighting for file sharing rights, as well as servers unrelated to The Pirate Bay or other file sharing activities Equipment such as hardware routers, switches, blank CDs, and fax machines were also seized [150]\n\n\nMay 2006 raid\nOn 31 May 2006, a raid against The Pirate Bay and people involved with the website took place as ordered by Swedish judge Tomas Norström, later the presiding judge of the 2009 trial, prompted by allegations of copyright violations Police officers shut down the website and confiscated its servers, as well as all other servers hosted by The Pirate Bay's Internet service provider, PRQ The company is owned by two operators of The

hardware routers, switches, blank CDs, and fax machines were also seized [150]\n\n\nAutopsy photos\nIn September 2008, the Swedish media reported that the public preliminary investigation protocols concerning a child murder case known as the Arboga case had been made available through a torrent on The Pirate Bay In Sweden, preliminary investigations became publicly available the moment a lawsuit is filed and can be ordered from the court by any individual The document included pictures from the autopsy of the two murdered children, which caused their father Nicklas Jangestig to urge the website to have the pictures removed [157] The Pirate Bay refused to remove the torrent The number of downloads increased to about 50,000 a few days later [158] On 11 September 2008, Sunde participated in the debate program Debatt on the public broadcaster SVT He had agreed to participate on the condition that the children's father, Nicklas Jangestig, would not take part in the debate Jangestig ultimately did participate in the program by telephone, which made Sunde feel betrayed by SVT [159] This caused The Pirate Bay to suspend all of its press contacts the following day [160] \"I don't think it's our job to judge if something is ethical or unethical or what other people want to put out on the internet\", Sunde said to TV4 [161]\n\n\nLegal issues\nIn September 2007, a large number of internal emails were leaked from anti-piracy company MediaDefender by an anonymous hacker Some of the leaked emails discussed hiring hackers to perform DDoS attacks on The Pirate Bay's servers and trackers [162] In response to the leak, The Pirate Bay filed charges in Sweden against MediaDefender clients Twentieth Century Fox Sweden AB, EMI Sweden AB, Universal Music Group Sweden AB, Universal Pictures Nordic AB, Paramount Home Entertainment (Sweden) AB, Atari Nordic AB, Activision Nordic, Ubisoft Sweden AB, Sony BMG Music Entertainment (Sweden) AB, and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment Nordic AB, [163] but the charges were not pursued [162] MediaDefender's stocks fell sharply after this incident, and several media companies withdrew from the service after the company announced the leak had caused $825,000 in losses [164]\n\n\nTrial\nThe Pirate Bay trial was a joint criminal and civil prosecution in Sweden of four individuals charged for promoting the copyright infringement of others with The Pirate Bay site [195] [196] The criminal charges were supported by a consortium of intellectual rights holders led by IFPI, who filed individual civil compensation claims against the owners of The Pirate Bay [197]\n\n\nService issues\nIn May 2007, The Pirate Bay was attacked by a group of hackers [207] They copied the user database, which included over 1.5 million users The Pirate Bay claimed to its users that the data was of no value and that passwords and e-mails were encrypted and hashed Some blogs stated that a group known as the AUH (Arga Unga Hackare, Swedish for \"Angry Young Hackers\") were suspected of executing the attack; however, the AUH stated on the Computer Sweden newspaper that they were not involved and would take revenge on those responsible for the attack [208] [209]\n\n\nAcquisition discussion\nOn 30 June 2009, Swedish advertising company Global Gaming Factory X AB announced their intention to buy the site for 60 million kronor (approximately US$8.5 million) (30 million kronor in cash, 30 million kronor in GGF shares) [225] [226]\n\n\nDecember 2014 raid\nOn 9 December 2014, police in Stockholm raided the company's premises and seized servers and other computers and equipment, which resulted in the website going offline The raid was in response to a complaint from Rights Alliance, a Swedish anti-piracy group [6] The Pirate Bay was one of many peer-to-peer and torrent-related websites and apps that went down [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] One member of the crew was arrested Torrent Freak reported that most other torrent sites reported a 5–10% increase in traffic from the displaced users, [231] though the shutdown had little effect on overall piracy levels [232] [233] In retaliation to the raid, a group of hackers claiming to be part of Anonymous allegedly leaked email log-in details of Swedish government officials [234] Sunde commented in a blog post that he was happy to see the website shut down, believing his successors have done nothing to improve the site, [235] criticising in particular the increased use of advertisements [236]\n\n\nError 522 downtimes\nBeginning in October 2018, the clearnet Pirate Bay website started to be inaccessible in some locations around the world, showing Error 522 As the result, direct visits to the website dropped by more than 32 percent in October The incident was found to be unrelated to internet provider blocking or domain name problem, but the exact cause has not been determined The site's Tor domain and proxies remained unaffected [245]\n\n\nCensorship and controversies\nThe Pirate Bay has sparked controversies and discussion about legal aspects of file sharing, copyright, and civil liberties and has become a platform for political initiatives against established intellectual property laws and a central figure in an anti-copyright movement [11] The website faced several shutdowns and domain seizures which \"did little to take the site offline, as it simply switched to a series of new web addresses and continued to operate\" [4]\n\n\nAnti-copyright movement\nThe Pirate Bay has sparked controversies and discussion

to operate\" [4]\n\n\nDomain blocking by countries\nThe Pirate Bay's website has been blocked in some countries, despite the relative ease by which such blocks can be circumvented in most countries While the URL to the Pirate Bay itself has been blocked in these countries, numerous mirror websites emerged to make the website available at different URLs, routing traffic around the block [248] [249] [250]\n\n\nSweden\nOn 13 February 2017, Sweden's Patent and Market Court of Appeal decided that the broadband provider Bredbandsbolaget must block its customers from accessing file sharing site The Pirate Bay, overruling a district court ruling to the contrary from 2015 This is the first time a site was openly blocked in Sweden The rest of the ISPs are expected to follow the same court orders [252] [253]\n\n\nCensorship by corporations\nAfter The Pirate Bay introduced a feature in March 2009 to easily share links to torrents on the social networking site Facebook, Wired found in May that Facebook had started blocking the links On further inspection, they discovered that all messages containing links to The Pirate Bay in both public and in private messages, regardless of content, were being blocked Electronic Frontier Foundation lawyers commented that Facebook might be working against the US Electronic Communications Privacy Act by intercepting user messages, but Facebook chief privacy officer Chris Kelly said that they have the right to use blocks on links where there is a \"demonstrated disregard for intellectual property rights\", following users' agreement on their terms of service Links to other similar sites have not been blocked [258] [259] [260]\n\n\nFacebook\nAfter The Pirate Bay introduced a feature in March 2009 to easily share links to torrents on the

URLs were flagged by one or more of these and were consequently blocked\", Microsoft told The Register in an emailed statement [261] [262]\n\n\nGoogle\nIn late November 2021, Google removed The Pirate Bay and more than 100 related domains from its search results in the Netherlands due to the Dutch court order [263] Two years later, in December 2023, the link to The Pirate Bay was removed from Google Knowledge Panel [264]\n\n\nIn media\nThe Pirate Bay is featured in Steal This Film (2006), a documentary series about society and filesharing, produced by The League of Noble Peers; in the Danish Documentary Good Copy Bad Copy, which explores the issues surrounding file copyright; and the documentary TPB AFK The Pirate Bay has been a topic on the US-syndicated NPR radio show On the Media [265] [266]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "The Pirate Bay is a Swedish-based website that allows users to search for and download various types of digital content, including movies, music, and software, using the BitTorrent peer-to-peer file sharing protocol. The website was founded in 2003 by a group of individuals who were passionate about file sharing and free access to information.\n\n## History\n\nThe Pirate Bay was established on 15 September 2003 by the Swedish anti-copyright organisation Piratbyrån (lit. 'The Piracy Bureau'); it has been run as a separate organisation since October 2004. The Pirate Bay was first run by Fredrik Neij and Gottfrid Svartholm with Peter Sunde as the spokesperson; the founders are known by their nicknames \"TiAMO\", \"anakata\", and \"brokep\", respectively. They have both been accused of \"assisting in making copyrighted content available\" by the Motion Picture Association of America.\n\nOn 31 May 2006, the website's servers in Stockholm were raided and seized by Swedish police, leading to three days of downtime. The Pirate Bay claims to be a non-profit entity based in Seychelles; however, this is disputed.\n\n## Website\n\nThe Pirate Bay allows users to search for Magnet links, which are used to reference resources available for download via peer-to-peer networks. These links, when opened in a BitTorrent client, begin downloading the desired content. Originally, The Pirate Bay allowed users to download BitTorrent files (torrents), small files that contain metadata necessary to download the data files from other users. The torrents are organised into categories: \"Audio\", \"Video\", \"Applications\", \"Games\", \"Porn\", and \"Other\". Registration requires an email address and is free; registered users may upload their own torrents and comment on torrents.\n\nAccording to a study of newly uploaded files during 2013 by TorrentFreak, 44% of uploads were television shows and movies, porn was in second place with 35% of uploads, and audio made up 9% of uploads. Registration for new users was closed in May 2019 following problems with the uploading of malware torrents. Registrations were reopened in June 2023, following the closure of RARBG, which further restricted the online possibilities of new potential uploaders and pushed TPB team to act.\n\n## Technical details\n\nInitially, The Pirate Bay's four Linux servers ran a custom web server called Hypercube. An old version is open-source. On 1 June 2005, The Pirate Bay updated its website in an effort to reduce bandwidth usage, which was reported to be at 2 HTTP requests per millisecond on each of the four web servers, as well as to create a more user friendly interface for the front-end of the website. The website now runs Lighttpd and PHP on its dynamic front ends, MySQL at the database back end, Sphinx on the two search systems, memcached for caching SQL queries and PHP-sessions and Varnish in front of Lighttpd for caching static content. As of September 2008, The Pirate Bay consisted of 31 dedicated servers including nine dynamic web fronts, a database, two search engines, and eight BitTorrent trackers.\n\n## Funding\n\nIn April 2007, a rumour was confirmed on the Swedish talk show Bert that The Pirate Bay had received financial support from right-wing entrepreneur Carl Lundström. This caused some consternation since Lundström, an heir to the Wasabröd fortune, is known for financing several far-right political parties and movements like Sverigedemokraterna and Bevara Sverige Svenskt (Keep Sweden Swedish). During the talk show, Piratbyrån spokesman Tobias Andersson acknowledged that \"without Lundström's support, Pirate Bay would not have been able to start\" and stated that most of the money went towards acquiring servers and bandwidth.\n\nFrom 2004 until 2006, The Pirate Bay had a \"Donate\" link to a donations page which listed several payment methods, stated that funds supported only the tracker, and offered time-limited benefits to donors such as no advertisements and \"VIP\" status. After that, the link was removed from the home page, and the donations page only recommended donating \"to your local pro-piracy group\" for a time, after which it redirected to the site's main page. Billboard claimed that the site in 2009 \"appeals for donations to keep its service running\". In 2006, Petter Nilsson, a candidate on the Swedish political reality show Toppkandidaterna (The Top Candidates), donated 35,000 Swedish kronor (US$4,925.83) to The Pirate Bay, which they used to buy new servers.\n\n## Merchandising\n\nThe site linked to an online store selling site-related merchandise, first noted in 2006 in Svenska Dagbladet.\n\n## Advertising\n\nSince 2006, the website has received financing through advertisements on result pages. According to speculations by Svenska Dagbladet, the advertisements generate about 600,000 kronor ($84,000) per month. In an investigation in 2006, the police concluded that The Pirate Bay brings in 1.2 million kronor ($169,000) per year from advertisements. The prosecution estimated in the 2009 trial from emails and screenshots that the advertisements pay over 10 million kronor ($1.4 million) a year, but the indictment used the estimate from the police investigation. The lawyers of the site's administrators counted the 2006 revenue closer to 725,000 kronor ($102,000). The verdict of the first trial, however, quoted the estimate from the preliminary investigation.\n\n## Cryptocurrency mining and tokens\n\nIn 2017, The Pirate Bay embedded scripts on its website that would consume resources on visitors' computers in order to mine the Monero cryptocurrency. Visitors were initially not informed that these scripts had been added. After negative feedback, the operators published an announcement stating that it was a test to see if it could replace advertisements. The mining script appeared and disappeared from the website repeatedly over the following months through 2018. In 2021 The Pirate Bay embarked in a short-lived creation of their own crypto tokens, which were rapidly abandoned.\n\n## Fee\n\nAccording to the site's usage policy, it reserves the right to charge commercial policy violators \"a basic fee of €5,000 plus bandwidth and other costs that may arise due to the violation\". Sunde accused Swedish book publishers, who scraped the site for information about copyrighted books, of violating the usage policy, and asserted TPB's copyright on its database.\n\n## Projects\n\nThe team behind The Pirate Bay has worked on several websites and software projects of varying degrees of permanence. In 2007, BayImg, an image hosting website similar to TinyPic went online in June.

All servers in the room were seized, including those running the website of Piratbyrån, an independent organisation fighting for file sharing rights, as well as servers unrelated to The Pirate Bay or other file sharing activities. Equipment such as hardware routers, switches, blank CDs, and fax machines were also seized.\n\nIn September 2008, the Swedish media reported that the public preliminary investigation protocols concerning a child murder case known as the Arboga case had been made available through a torrent on The Pirate Bay.

shows and movies, porn was in second place with 35% of uploads, and audio made up 9% of uploads [48] Registration for new users was closed in May 2019 following problems with the uploading of malware torrents [49] Registrations were reopened in June 2023, following the closure of RARBG, which further restricted the online possibilities of new potential uploaders and pushed TPB team to act  [50]\n\n\nContent\nThe Pirate Bay allows users to search for Magnet links These are used to reference resources available for download via peer-to-peer networks which, when opened in a BitTorrent client, begin downloading the desired content Originally, [46] The Pirate Bay allowed users to download BitTorrent files (torrents), small files that contain metadata necessary to download the data files from other users The torrents are organised into categories: \"Audio\", \"Video\", \"Applications\", \"Games\", \"Porn\", and \"Other\" [47] Registration requires an email address and is free; registered users may upload their own torrents and comment on torrents According to a study of newly uploaded files during 2013 by TorrentFreak, 44% of uploads were television shows and movies, porn

Registrations were reopened in June 2023, following the closure of RARBG, which further restricted the online possibilities of new potential uploaders and pushed TPB team to act  [50]\n\n\nTechnical details\nInitially, The Pirate Bay's four Linux servers ran a custom web server called Hypercube An old version is open-source [55] On 1 June 2005, The Pirate Bay updated its website in an effort to reduce bandwidth usage, which was reported to be at 2 HTTP requests per millisecond on each of the four web servers, [56] as well as to create a more user friendly interface for the front-end of the website The website now runs Lighttpd and PHP on its dynamic front ends, MySQL at the database back end, Sphinx on the two search systems, memcached for caching SQL queries and PHP-sessions and Varnish in front of Lighttpd for caching static content As of September 2008 [update], The Pirate Bay consisted of 31 dedicated servers including nine dynamic web fronts, a database, two search engines, and eight BitTorrent trackers [57]\n\n\nFunding\nIn April 2007, a rumour was confirmed on the Swedish talk show Bert that The Pirate Bay had received financial support from right-wing entrepreneur Carl Lundström This caused some consternation since Lundström, an heir to the Wasabröd fortune, is known for financing several far-right political parties and movements like Sverigedemokraterna and Bevara Sverige Svenskt (Keep Sweden Swedish) During the talk show, Piratbyrån spokesman Tobias Andersson acknowledged that \"without Lundström's support, Pirate Bay would not have been able to start\" and stated that most of the money went towards acquiring servers and bandwidth [69] [70]\n\n\nEarly financing\nIn April 2007, a rumour was confirmed on the Swedish talk show Bert that The Pirate Bay had received financial support from right-wing entrepreneur Carl Lundström This caused some consternation since Lundström, an heir to the Wasabröd fortune, is known for financing several far-right political parties and movements like Sverigedemokraterna and Bevara Sverige Svenskt (Keep Sweden Swedish) During the talk show, Piratbyrån spokesman Tobias Andersson acknowledged that \"without Lundström's support, Pirate Bay would not have been able to start\" and stated that most of the money went towards acquiring servers and bandwidth [69] [70]\n\n\nDonations\nFrom 2004 until 2006, The Pirate Bay had a \"Donate\" link to a donations page which listed several payment methods, stated that funds supported only the tracker, and offered time-limited benefits to donors such as no advertisements and \"VIP\" status [71] After that, the link was removed from the home page, [72] and the donations page only recommended donating \"to your local pro-piracy group\" for a time, [73] after which it redirected to the site's main page Billboard claimed that the site in 2009 \"appeals for donations to keep its service running\" [74] In 2006, Petter Nilsson, a candidate on the Swedish political reality show Toppkandidaterna (The Top Candidates), donated 35,000 Swedish kronor (US$4,925.83) to The Pirate Bay, which they used to buy new servers [75] [76]\n\n\nMerchandising\nThe site linked to an online store selling site-related merchandise, first noted in 2006 in Svenska Dagbladet [82] [83]\n\n\nAdvertising\nSince 2006, the website has received financing through advertisements on result pages According to speculations by Svenska Dagbladet, the advertisements generate about 600,000 kronor ($84,000) per month [84] [85] In an investigation in 2006, the police concluded that The Pirate Bay brings in 1.2 million kronor ($169,000) per year from advertisements [86] The prosecution estimated in the 2009 trial from emails and screenshots that the advertisements pay over 10 million kronor ($1.4 million) a year, [87] but the indictment used the estimate from the police investigation [88] The lawyers of the site's administrators counted the 2006 revenue closer to 725,000 kronor ($102,000) [89] The verdict of the first trial, however, quoted the estimate from the preliminary investigation [90]\n\n\nCryptocurrency mining and tokens\nIn 2017, The Pirate Bay embedded scripts on its website that would consume resources on visitors' computers in order to mine the Monero cryptocurrency Visitors were initially not informed that these scripts had been added [96] After negative feedback, the operators published an announcement stating that it was a test to see if it could replace advertisements [97] The mining script appeared and disappeared from the website repeatedly over the following months through 2018 [98] In 2021 The Pirate Bay embarked in a short lived creation of their own crypto tokens, which were rapidly abandoned  [99]\n\n\nFee\nAccording to the site's usage policy, it reserves the right to charge commercial policy violators \"a basic fee of €5,000 plus bandwidth and other costs that may arise due to the violation\" [100] Sunde accused Swedish book publishers, who scraped the site for information about copyrighted books, of violating the usage policy, and asserted TPB's copyright on its database [101]\n\n\nProjects\nThe team behind The Pirate Bay has worked on several websites and software projects of varying degrees of permanence In 2007, BayImg, an image hosting website similar to TinyPic went online in June [103] [104] Pre-publication images posted to BayImg became part of a legal battle when Conde Nast's network was later allegedly hacked [105] [106] In July, \"within hours after Ingmar Bergman's death\", BergmanBits.com was launched, listing torrents for the director's films, [103] [107] [108] online until mid-2008 [109] In August, The Pirate Bay relaunched the BitTorrent website Suprnova.org to perform the same functions as The Pirate Bay, with different torrent trackers, but the site languished; the domain was returned to its original owner in August 2010, and it now redirects to TorrentFreak.tv [110] [111] Suprbay.org was introduced in August as the official forum for ThePirateBay.org and the various sites connected to it Users can request reseeding of torrents, or report malware within torrent files or illegal material on ThePirateBay.org [112] [113]\n\n\nPurchases\nIn January 2007, when the micronation of Sealand was put up for sale, the ACFI and The Pirate Bay tried to buy it The Sealand government, however, did not want to be involved with The Pirate Bay, as it was their opinion that file sharing represented \"theft of proprietary rights\" [142] [143] A new plan was formed to buy an island instead, but this too was never implemented, despite the website having raised US$25,000 (€15,000) in donations for this cause [144]\n\n\nCryptocurrency\nOn 12 May 2021, The Pirate Bay launched Pirate Token, a BEP-20 token, to be used to sustain its community and develop tools for the website [147] [148]\n\n\nIncidents\nOn 31 May 2006, a raid against The Pirate Bay and people involved with the website took place as ordered by Swedish judge Tomas Norström, later the presiding judge of the 2009 trial, prompted by allegations of copyright violations Police officers shut down the website and confiscated its servers, as well as all other servers hosted by The Pirate Bay's Internet service provider, PRQ The company is owned by two operators of The Pirate Bay Three people – Neij, Svartholm and Mikael Viborg – were held by the police for questioning, but were released later that evening [149] All servers in the room were seized, including those running the website of Piratbyrån, an independent organisation fighting for file sharing rights, as well as servers unrelated to The Pirate Bay or other file sharing activities Equipment such as hardware routers, switches, blank CDs, and fax machines were also seized [150]\n\n\nMay 2006 raid\nOn 31 May 2006, a raid against The Pirate Bay and people involved with the website took place as ordered by Swedish judge Tomas Norström, later the presiding judge of the 2009 trial, prompted by allegations of copyright violations

hardware routers, switches, blank CDs, and fax machines were also seized [150]\n\n\nAutopsy photos\nIn September 2008, the Swedish media reported that the public preliminary investigation protocols concerning a child murder case known as the Arboga case had been made available through a torrent on The Pirate Bay In Sweden, preliminary investigations became publicly available the moment a lawsuit is filed and can be ordered from the court by any individual The document included pictures from the autopsy of the two murdered children, which caused their father Nicklas Jangestig to urge the website to have the pictures removed [157] The Pirate Bay refused to remove the torrent The number of downloads increased to about 50,000 a few days later [158] On 11 September 2008, Sunde participated in the debate program Debatt on the public broadcaster SVT He had agreed to participate on the condition that the children's father, Nicklas Jangestig, would not take part in the debate Jangestig ultimately did participate in the program by telephone, which made Sunde feel betrayed by SVT [159] This caused The Pirate Bay to suspend all of its press contacts the following day [160] \"I don't think it's our job to judge if something is ethical or unethical or what other people want to put out on the internet\", Sunde said to TV4 [161]\n\n\nLegal issues\nIn September 2007, a large number of internal emails were leaked from anti-piracy company MediaDefender by an anonymous hacker Some of the leaked emails discussed hiring hackers to perform DDoS attacks on The Pirate Bay's servers and trackers [162] In response to the leak, The Pirate Bay filed charges in Sweden against MediaDefender clients Twentieth Century Fox Sweden AB, EMI Sweden AB, Universal Music Group Sweden AB, Universal Pictures Nordic AB, Paramount Home Entertainment (Sweden) AB, Atari Nordic AB, Activision Nordic, Ubisoft Sweden AB, Sony BMG Music Entertainment (Sweden) AB, and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment Nordic AB, [163] but the charges were not pursued [162] MediaDefender's stocks fell sharply after this incident, and several media companies withdrew from the service after the company announced the leak had caused $825,000 in losses [164]\n\n\nTrial\nThe Pirate Bay trial was a joint criminal and civil prosecution in Sweden of four individuals charged for promoting the copyright infringement of others with The Pirate Bay site [195] [196] The criminal charges were supported by a consortium of intellectual rights holders led by IFPI, who filed individual civil compensation claims against the owners of The Pirate Bay [197]\n\n\nService issues\nIn May 2007, The Pirate Bay was attacked by a group of hackers [207] They copied the user database, which included over 1.5 million users The Pirate Bay claimed to its users that the data was of no value and that passwords and e-mails were encrypted and hashed Some blogs stated that a group known as the AUH (Arga Unga Hackare, Swedish for \"Angry Young Hackers\") were suspected of executing the attack; however, the AUH stated on the Computer Sweden newspaper that they were not involved and would take revenge on those responsible for the attack [208] [209]\n\n\nAcquisition discussion\nOn 30 June 2009, Swedish advertising company Global Gaming Factory X AB announced their intention to buy the site for 60 million kronor (approximately US$8.5 million) (30 million kronor in cash, 30 million kronor in GGF shares) [225] [226]\n\n\nDecember 2014 raid\nOn 9 December 2014, police in Stockholm raided the company's premises and seized servers and other computers and equipment, which resulted in the website going offline The raid was in response to a complaint from Rights Alliance, a Swedish anti-piracy group [6] The Pirate Bay was one of many peer-to-peer and torrent-related websites and apps that went down [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] One member of the crew was arrested Torrent Freak reported that most other torrent sites reported a 5–10% increase in traffic from the displaced users, [231] though the shutdown had little effect on overall piracy levels [232] [233] In retaliation to the raid, a group of hackers claiming to be part of Anonymous allegedly leaked email log-in details of Swedish government officials [234] Sunde commented in a blog post that he was happy to see the website shut down, believing his successors have done nothing to improve the site, [235] criticising in particular the increased use of advertisements [236]\n\n\nError 522 downtimes\nBeginning in October 2018, the clearnet Pirate Bay website started to be inaccessible in some locations around the world, showing Error 522 As the result, direct visits to the website dropped by more than 32 percent in October The incident was found to be unrelated to internet provider blocking or domain name problem, but the exact cause has not been determined The site's Tor domain and proxies remained unaffected [245]\n\n\nCensorship and controversies\nThe Pirate Bay has sparked controversies and discussion about legal aspects of file sharing, copyright, and civil liberties and has become a platform for political initiatives against established intellectual property laws and a central figure in an anti-copyright movement [11] The website faced several shutdowns and domain seizures which \"did little to take the site offline, as it simply switched to a series of new web addresses and continued to operate\" [4]\n\n\nAnti-copyright movement\nThe Pirate Bay has sparked controversies and discussion

to operate\" [4]\n\n\nDomain blocking by countries\nThe Pirate Bay's website has been blocked in some countries, despite the relative ease by which such blocks can be circumvented in most countries While the URL to the Pirate Bay itself has been blocked in these countries, numerous mirror websites emerged to make the website available at different URLs, routing traffic around the block [248] [249] [250]\n\n\nSweden\nOn 13 February 2017, Sweden's Patent and Market Court of Appeal decided that the broadband provider Bredbandsbolaget must block its customers from accessing file sharing site The Pirate Bay, overruling a district court ruling to the contrary from 2015 This is the first time a site was openly blocked in Sweden The rest of the ISPs are expected to follow the same court orders [252] [253]\n\n\nCensorship by corporations\nAfter The Pirate Bay introduced a feature in March 2009 to easily share links to torrents on the social networking site Facebook, Wired found in May that Facebook had started blocking the links On further inspection, they discovered that all messages containing links to The Pirate Bay in both public and in private messages, regardless of content, were being blocked Electronic Frontier Foundation lawyers commented that Facebook might be working against the US Electronic Communications Privacy Act by intercepting user messages, but Facebook chief privacy officer Chris Kelly said that they have the right to use blocks on links where there is a \"demonstrated disregard for intellectual property rights\", following users' agreement on their terms of service Links to other similar sites have not been blocked [258] [259] [260]\n\n\nFacebook\nAfter The Pirate Bay introduced a feature in March 2009 to easily share links to torrents on the

blocked Windows Live Messenger messages containing links to The Pirate Bay When a user sends an instant message that contains a link to The Pirate Bay, Windows Live Messenger prompts a warning and claims \"Blocked as it was reported unsafe\" \"We block instant messages if they contain malicious or spam URLs based on intelligence algorithms, third-party sources, and/or user complaints Pirate Bay URLs were flagged by one or more of these and were consequently blocked\", Microsoft told The Register in an emailed statement [261] [262]\n\n\nGoogle\nIn late November 2021, Google removed The Pirate Bay and more than 100 related domains from its search results in the Netherlands due to the Dutch court order [263] Two years later, in December 2023, the link to The Pirate Bay was removed from Google Knowledge Panel [264]\n\n\nIn media\nThe Pirate Bay is featured in Steal This Film (2006), a documentary series about society and filesharing, produced by The League of Noble Peers; in the Danish Documentary Good Copy Bad Copy, which explores the issues surrounding file copyright; and the documentary TPB AFK The Pirate Bay has been a topic on the US-syndicated NPR radio show On the Media [265] [266]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Estonia", "content": "\nName\nThe name Estonia (Estonian: Eesti  [ˈeˑstʲi] ⓘ) has been connected to Aesti, a people first mentioned by Ancient Roman historian Tacitus around 98 CE Some modern historians believe he was referring to Balts, while others have proposed that the name then applied to the whole eastern Baltic Sea region [29] Scandinavian sagas and Viking runestones [30] referring to Eistland are the earliest known sources that definitely use the name in its modern geographic meaning [31] From Old Norse the toponym spread to other Germanic vernaculars and reached literary Latin by the end of 12th century [32] [33]\n\n\nHistory\nThe oldest known settlement in Estonia is the Pulli settlement; according to radiocarbon dating, it was settled around 11,000 years ago [34] The earliest human habitation during the Mesolithic period is connected to the Kunda culture [35] Around 5300 BCE, ceramics appear of the neolithic period, known as Narva culture [36] This was followed by the Comb Ceramic culture around 3900 BC, bringing early agriculture and sophisticated religious art [37] Starting from around 2800 BC the Corded Ware culture appeared; this included new activities like primitive farming and animal husbandry [38] The Comb Ceramic and Corded Ware cultures coexisted in Estonia for a millennium, before eventually blending into a Bronze Age Estonian culture [37] Archaeological estimates place the population within Estonian territory at a modest level, with approximately 6,000 inhabitants in 3900 BC, rising to around 10,000 by 2000 BC [37]\n\n\nPrehistory\nThe oldest known settlement in Estonia is the Pulli settlement; according to radiocarbon dating, it was settled around 11,000 years ago [34] The earliest human habitation during

population within Estonian territory at a modest level, with approximately 6,000 inhabitants in 3900 BC, rising to around 10,000 by 2000 BC [37]\n\n\nViking Age and ancient chiefdoms\nNorth Estonian coast was strategically located on the route from the Varangians to the Greeks, making Estonia a trade hub while also being both a target and starting point for many raids Coastal Estonians, particularly Oeselians from Saaremaa, adopted Viking lifestyle [50] [51] Several Scandinavian sagas referred to major confrontations with Estonians, notably when in the early 7th century \"Estonian Vikings\" defeated and killed Ingvar Harra, the King of Swedes [52] [53] The Salme ship burials dating from mid-8th century have been suggested as a possible starting point for the Viking Age in Europe [54] [55]\n\n\nCrusades and the Catholic Era\nIn 1199, Pope Innocent III declared a crusade to \"defend the Christians of Livonia\" [74] Fighting reached Estonia in 1206, when Danish King Valdemar II unsuccessfully invaded Saaremaa The German Livonian Brothers of the Sword, who had previously subjugated Livonians, Latgalians, and Selonians, started campaigning against the Estonians in 1208, and over the next few years both sides made numerous raids and counter-raids A major leader of the Estonian resistance was Lembitu, an elder of Sakala County, but in 1217 the Estonians suffered a significant defeat in the Battle of St Matthew's Day, where Lembitu was killed In 1219, Valdemar II landed at Lindanise, defeated the Estonians in the Battle of Lyndanisse, and started conquering Northern Estonia [75] [76] The next year, Sweden invaded Western Estonia, but were repelled by the Oeselians In 1223, a major revolt ejected the Germans and Danes from the whole of Estonia, except Tallinn, but the crusaders soon resumed their offensive, and in 1227, Saaremaa was the last maakond (county) to surrender [77] [78]\n\n\nReformation and the Livonian War\nThe Reformation began in central Europe in 1517, and soon spread northward to Livonia despite some opposition by the Livonian Order [92] Protestant preaching began actively in Tallinn in 1524, leading the town council to align with the Reformation by the following year Similar events unfolded in Tartu, where tensions arose with Catholic Bishop Johann Blankenfeld, resulting in iconoclastic riots that damaged Catholic churches and monasteries in both cities By the late 1520s, most Estonian towns had embraced the Reformation, although Catholic influence remained stronger in Viljandi, Haapsalu, and Vana-Pärnu Unlike the cities, rural areas were slower to adopt Protestantism, with Catholic influence persisting among local nobility and peasants well into the 1530s [93] [94] With the Reformation, church services began to be conducted in vernacular language, which initially meant Low German, but already from the 1530s onward the regular religious services were held in Estonian [93] [95] Early Estonian-language Protestant texts emerged, including Wanradt–Koell Catechism in 1535 [96]\n\n\nSwedish and Russian rule\nThe Polish–Swedish War, which began in 1600, unleashed years of further devastation across Estonia The Battle of Weissenstein (Paide) in 1604 marked a critical turning point, where Lithuanian hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz led a smaller Polish-Lithuanian force of 2,300 to a decisive victory against a Swedish army of 6,000 Despite this victory and others, the wars stretched on until 1629, concluding with Sweden gaining Livonia, including Southern Estonia and Northern Latvia, altering the power balance in the Baltic region [106] In addition, Danish Saaremaa was transferred to Sweden in 1645 [107] During the Russo-Swedish War, Russia in 1656 captured eastern parts of Estonia, including Tartu, holding it until the Treaty of Cardis was concluded in 1661 [108] The wars had halved the population of Estonia from about 250–270,000 people in the mid 16th century to 115–120,000 in the 1630s [109]\n\n\nNational Awakening\nThe reopening of the university in Tartu in 1802 gave opportunities for higher education to both Baltic German and a growing number of Estonian students Among the latter were first public proponents of Estonian nationalism, such as young poet Kristjan Jaak Peterson At the same time, the nationalist ideas of Johann Gottfried Herder greatly influenced the Baltic German intelligentsia to see the value in the native Estonian culture [122] The resulting Estophile movement gave rise to the Learned Estonian Society and other scientific societies, supported Estonian-language education and founded the first newspapers in the Estonian language They also began to value and collect the Estonian folklore, including surviving pre-Christian myths and traditions [123] Another sign of a rising Estonian national consciousness was a mass movement in South Estonia to convert to Eastern Orthodoxy in the 1840s, following a famine and a promise for being rewarded with land [124]\n\n\nIndependence\nDuring World War I, over 100,000 Estonian men were mobilized into the Imperial Russian Army Of these, approximately 8,000 to 10,000 perished, and one in five suffered injuries [138] In the turmoil of war, ideas for establishing an Estonian national army began to take root, while the shortages and hardships on the home front led to civil unrest Despite repeated appeals and promises, the Russian imperial government resisted expanding Estonian political rights In 1917, following the February Revolution, the Russian Provisional Government finally conceded to Estonian demands Estonia was granted autonomy, and the Estonian Provincial Assembly was formed through democratic elections In addition, the territory of autonomous Estonia was expanded to include the Estonian-speaking areas of Livonia [139]\n\n\nWorld War II\nA week before the outbreak of World War II, on 23 August 1939, Nazi Germany and the Stalinist Soviet Union signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact In the pact's secret protocol Poland, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Finland were divided between USSR and Germany into \"spheres of influence\", with Estonia assigned to the Soviet \"sphere\" [162] On 24 September 1939, the Soviet dictator Stalin presented the Estonian government an ultimatum demanding that Estonia immediately sign a treaty that would allow the USSR to establish military bases in Estonia, or else face war The Estonian government decided to avoid military conflict, and a \"mutual assistance treaty\" was signed in Moscow on 28 September 1939 [163] On 14 June 1940 the Soviet Union instituted a full naval and air blockade on Estonia On the same day, the airliner Kaleva was shot down by the Soviet Air Force On 16 June, the USSR presented an ultimatum demanding completely free passage of the Red Army into Estonia and the establishment of a pro-Soviet government Feeling that resistance was hopeless, the Estonian government complied and, on the next day, the whole country was occupied [164] [165] The Independent Signal Battalion was the only unit of the Estonian Army to offer armed resistance to occupation [166] [167] On 6 August 1940, Estonia was formally annexed by the Soviet Union as the Estonian SSR [168]\n\n\nSoviet occupation\nFollowing the renewed Soviet occupation of Estonia, thousands of Estonians once again joined the Forest Brothers to resist Soviet rule This armed resistance was particularly intense in the immediate post-war years, but Soviet forces eventually wore it down through relentless attrition tactics, bringing an end to organized armed resistance by the 1960s [189] The Soviet regime also intensified its policy of collectivisation, forcing Estonian farmers to abandon private agriculture and join state-run collectives When locals resisted, authorities launched a campaign of terror, culminating in March 1949 with operation Priboi – the mass deportation of around 20,000 Estonians to the gulag system in Siberia [190] Full collectivization followed shortly after, marking a new phase of Soviet control over Estonia's economy [169] [191]\n\n\nIndependence restored\nThe introduction of perestroika by the Soviet government in 1987 reopened the possibility for political activism in Estonia, sparking the Singing Revolution, a peaceful movement towards independence [205] One of the first major acts of resistance was the Phosphorite War, an environmental protest against Soviet plans to establish large phosphate mines in Virumaa [206] On 23 August 1987, the Hirvepark meeting in Tallinn called for the public disclosure of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and its secret protocols which had led to Estonia's loss of independence Although direct demands for independence were not yet made, organizers aimed to reinforce the continuity of the Estonian state and prepare the foundation for a restoration based on legal principles [207] [208]\n\n\nGeography\nEstonia is in Europe, [d] on the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea, on the East European Plain [226] [227] [228] It is bordered to the north by the Gulf of Finland across from Finland, to the west by the sea across from Sweden, to the south by Latvia, and to the east by Lake Peipsi and Russia [229] It covers an area of 45,335 km2 (17,504 sq mi), of which 4.6% is internal waters [226]\n\n\nGeology\nEstonia is located on the northwestern part of the East European Platform, bordering the Fennoscandian Shield Estonia's bedrock consists of two main layers: the crystalline basement and the sedimentary cover These are further classified into three distinct geological complexes The crystalline basement, composed of granites, gneisses, and other crystalline rocks, formed during the Proterozoic This is overlain by a sedimentary cover of Paleozoic rocks, including limestones and sandstones Above this, a quaternary surface layer is mainly composed of unconsolidated sediments such as gravels, sands, and clays, which formed in the Cenozoic [233]\n\n\nClimate\nEstonia experiences a transitional climate that lies between continental and maritime influences, characterized as a humid continental climate Located at the same latitude as the northern tips of central Sweden and Scotland, Estonia's climate is notably milder than that of other regions at the same latitude due to the moderating effects of the Atlantic Ocean and the North Atlantic current In North America, Estonia aligns with the average latitude of the Labrador Peninsula and the southern coast of Alaska, making its climate unique for its geographical position The prevailing weather patterns in Estonia are significantly influenced by active cyclonic activity in the northern Atlantic, particularly from the Icelandic low This results in strong winds, precipitation, and abrupt temperature fluctuations, especially during the autumn and winter months The westerly winds carry moist maritime air far into the continental interior, leading to milder temperatures in winter and slightly cooler conditions in summer compared to continental areas further away from the coast Coastal regions and islands generally enjoy a milder climate, with the Baltic Sea moderating temperatures, keeping coastal areas warmer in winter and cooler in summer [237]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nEstonia is recognized as one of the most biodiverse regions in Europe, particularly for its size and latitude [227] The country boasts a diverse array of climatic and soil conditions, as well as an abundance of both marine and freshwater ecosystems This rich biodiversity allows for the survival of many species that have become extinct in most other European nations [243] Protected areas cover 19.4% of Estonian land and 23% of its total area together with territorial sea The country is home to nearly 4,000 protected natural objects, which encompass six national parks, 231 nature conservation areas, and 154 landscape reserves [244]\n\n\nEnvironment\nThe environmental status in Estonia is generally favorable, but issues persist regarding pollution from transportation, the preservation of biodiversity, and the protection of water bodies Lake Peipus, the largest transboundary lake in Europe, faces significant ecological challenges Monitoring data from 2009 to 2023 reveal that the lake's water quality indicators are predominantly in poor ecological condition In 2023, unusually high water temperatures promoted the release of phosphorus from lake sediments, further deteriorating water quality Additionally, water transparency in both Estonian and Russian parts of the lake has shown a declining trend, signaling ongoing environmental stress [258]\n\n\nPolitics\nEstonia is a unitary parliamentary republic where the unicameral parliament, the Riigikogu, serves as the legislature and the government acts as the executive branch [262] The Riigikogu comprises 101 members elected for four-year terms by proportional representation, with voting rights granted to citizens over 18 years of age The parliament holds several key responsibilities: it approves the national government, passes legal acts and the state budget, and exercises parliamentary oversight Additionally, upon the president's recommendation, the Riigikogu appoints the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the chair of the Bank of Estonia, the Auditor General, the Chancellor of Justice, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces [263] [264]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nEstonia is a unitary country with a single-tier local government system Local affairs are managed autonomously by local governments Since administrative reform in 2017, there are in total 79 local governments, including 15 towns and 64 rural municipalities All municipalities have equal legal status and form part of a maakond (county), which is an administrative subunit of the state [275] Representative body of local authorities is municipal council, elected at general direct elections for a four-year term The council appoints local government For towns, the head of the local government is linnapea (mayor) and vallavanem for parishes For additional decentralization the local authorities may form municipal districts with limited authority, currently those have been formed in Tallinn and Hiiumaa and several other parishes [276]\n\n\nLaw\nThe Constitution of Estonia is the fundamental law, establishing the constitutional order based on five principles: human dignity, democracy, rule of law, social state, and the Estonian identity [278] Estonia has a civil law legal system based on the Germanic legal model [279] The court system has a three-level structure The first instance are county courts which handle all criminal and civil cases, and administrative courts which hear complaints about government and local officials, and other public disputes The second instance are district courts which handle appeals about the first instance decisions [280] The Supreme Court is the court of cassation, conducts constitutional review, and has 19 members [281] The judiciary is independent, judges are appointed for life, and can be removed from office only when convicted of a crime [282] The justice system has been rated among the most efficient in the European Union by the EU Justice Scoreboard [283]\n\n\nForeign relations\nEstonia has actively pursued close relations with Western countries since restoring its independence in 1991 As a member of the League of Nations from 1921 and a United Nations member since 1991, [288] [289] Estonia quickly integrated into European and transatlantic frameworks, joining NATO and the European Union in 2004 [289] In 2007, Estonia joined the Schengen Area, and in 2011 the Eurozone [289] Tallinn hosts the European Union Agency for large-scale IT systems, which has been operational since 2012, [290] and Estonia held the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union in the second half of 2017 [291] Estonia is also a member of the OECD, OSCE, WTO, IMF, the Council of the Baltic Sea States, [289] [292] [293] and served as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for a two-year term beginning in January 2020 [294]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Estonian Defence Forces consist of land forces, navy, and air force The current national military service is compulsory for healthy men between ages of 18 and 28, with conscripts serving 8- or 11-month tours of duty, depending on their education and position provided by the Defence Forces [311] The peacetime size of the Estonian Defence Forces is about 6,000 persons, with half of those being conscripts The planned wartime size of the Defence Forces is 60,000 personnel, including 21,000 personnel in high readiness reserve [312] Since 2015, the Estonian defence budget has been over 2% of GDP, fulfilling its NATO defence spending obligation [313]\n\n\nLaw enforcement and emergency services\nEstonia is a country largely protected from major natural disasters due to its geographic location, avoiding the risks of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes and tropical cyclones However, certain natural events, such as forest fires, minor floods in low-lying areas, and occasional small earthquakes, still pose localized challenges The most significant recent disaster in Estonia's history was the 1994 sinking of the MS Estonia in the Baltic Sea, remaining the deadliest peactime maritime disaster in Europe [329]\n\n\nEconomy\nEstonia is a developed country with an advanced, high-income economy that was among the fastest-growing in the EU since its entry in 2004 [332] With a GDP (PPP) per capita of $46,385 in 2023, ranked 40th globally by the IMF, [15] Estonia ranks highly in international rankings for quality of life, [333] education, [334] [335] press freedom, [336] digitalisation of public services, [337] [338] the prevalence of technology companies, [339] and maintains very high rankings in the Human Development Index [340] One of the world's most digitally-advanced societies, [341] in 2005 Estonia became the first state to hold elections over the Internet, and in 2014, the first state to provide e-residency [342] Universal health care, [343] free education, [344] and the longest paid maternity leave in the OECD [345] are additional hallmarks of Estonia's social infrastructure.\n\n\nPublic policy\nEstonia's economy continues to benefit from a transparent government and policies that sustain a high level of economic freedom, ranking 6th globally and 2nd in Europe [355] [356] The rule of law remains strongly buttressed and enforced by an independent and efficient judicial system A simplified tax system with flat rates and low indirect taxation, openness to foreign investment, and a liberal trade regime have supported the resilient and well-functioning economy [357] As of May 2018 [update], the Ease of Doing Business Index by the World Bank Group places the country 16th in the world [358] The strong focus on the IT sector through its e-Estonia program has led to much faster, simpler and efficient public services where for example filing a tax return takes less than five minutes and 98% of banking transactions are conducted through the internet [359] [360] Estonia has the 13th lowest business bribery risk in the world, according to TRACE Matrix [361]\n\n\nTransportation\nEstonia's transportation system is an essential part of the country's infrastructure, facilitating both domestic and international movement of goods and people The primary modes of transportation include road, rail, maritime, and air transport, each contributing significantly to the economy and accessibility of the region The Port of Tallinn is one of the largest maritime enterprises in the Baltic Sea, catering to both cargo and passenger traffic Among the facilities is the ice-free port of Muuga, located near Tallinn, which boasts modern transhipment capabilities, a high-capacity grain elevator, chill and frozen storage, and enhanced oil tanker offloading facilities [371] Estonian shipping company Tallink operates a fleet of Baltic Sea cruiseferries and ropax ships, making it the largest passenger and cargo shipping operator in the Baltic Sea, with routes connecting Estonia to Finland and Sweden [372] The ferry lines to Estonian islands are operated by TS Laevad and Kihnu Veeteed [373]\n\n\nNatural resources and mining\nEstonia is relatively rich in materials that could potentially serve as natural resources, although many are not found in economically viable quantities or face technical and environmental challenges that hinder their extraction The country has large oil shale (particularly kukersite) and limestone deposits In addition to oil shale and limestone, Estonia also has large reserves of phosphorite, pitchblende, and granite that currently are not mined, or not mined extensively [385] The underground resources may include gold, molybdenum, platinum, vanadium, and strontium Future potential resources are thought to include diatomaceous earth and uranium There are also indications of oil near Hiiumaa and natural gas reserves in North Estonia Currently, the most significant resources being exploited in Estonia are oil shale and phosphorite, along with natural building materials such as sand, gravel, limestone, and clay [386]\n\n\nEnergy\nThe energy sector in Estonia has historically been dominated by the oil shale industry, which has played a crucial role in electricity production since the 1920s The oil shale industry, concentrated in Virumaa, produces around 73% of the entire country's electricity [392] In recent years, however, there has been a significant growth in renewable energy generation, alongside ongoing discussions regarding the potential future use of nuclear energy The largest producer of electricity and thermal energy in Estonia is the state-owned company Eesti Energia Oil shale remains the primary energy source in Estonia, primarily utilized for electricity generation and heating, particularly in Narva In addition to electricity, Estonia has been increasingly producing oil from this resource, with production volumes steadily rising Other energy sources include peat, firewood, hydroelectric and wind energy, solar panels, and imported natural and liquefied gas, as well as coal [393]\n\n\nAgriculture, fishery and forestry\nAgriculture is one of Estonia's traditional economic sectors, historically crucial to the country's economy Following Estonia's re-independence, agricultural significance in the economy declined sharply as large Soviet-era collective farms were dismantled and privatized In recent years, large enterprises have once again become dominant, while smaller farms focus on niche markets, organic farming, and rural tourism Recent years have seen an increase in Estonia's cultivated land, with approximately 1.05 million hectares of arable land and 0.24 million hectares of natural grasslands recorded by 2019 [407] [408] Estonia has one of the largest average farm sizes within the European Union at 62 hectares per farm, with around 78% of farmland owned by entities managing at least 100 hectares – far above the EU average of 49% for this ownership category [409] Estonia ranks second in Europe, following Austria, in the proportion of farmland under organic cultivation [410]\n\n\nIndustry and services\nIndustry serves as a foundational pillar of Estonia's economy, with the manufacturing sector being the largest segment, accounting for approximately 15% of the national GDP This sector provides employment for around one-fifth of the workforce, equating to about 120,000 individuals Additionally, the export turnover of industrial enterprises typically represents around two-thirds of Estonia's total export volume [415] Food, construction, and electronic industries are currently among the most important branches of Estonia's industry [416] Key branches within Estonia's industry include food production, construction, and electronics, with the construction industry alone employing over 80,000 people in 2007, roughly 12% of the total workforce [417] The machinery and chemical industries are also significant, primarily concentrated in Ida-Viru County and around Tallinn.\n\n\nScience and technology\nEarly scientific contributions in Estonia began with indigenous knowledge of agricultural practices and the medicinal effects of herbal remedies The University of Tartu has catalyzed further scientific advancements, leading to contributions by biologists such as Karl Ernst von Baer, Alexander von Middendorff, Jakob von Uexküll and Eerik Kumari Esteemed chemists like Wilhelm Ostwald and Carl Schmidt, economist Ragnar Nurkse, mathematician Edgar Krahn, medical researchers Ludvig Puusepp and Nikolay Pirogov also made significant contributions Notable physicists included Georg Wilhelm Richmann and Thomas Johann Seebeck, while Rein Taagepera advanced political science, and Endel Tulving and Risto Näätänen made strides in psychology The field of semiotics has been pioneered by Juri Lotman.\n\n\nDemographics\nThe Estonian society has undergone considerable changes since the country had restored full independence in 1991 [436] Some of the more notable changes have taken effect in the level of stratification and distribution of family income The Gini coefficient has held steadily higher than the European Union average (31 in 2009), [437] although it has clearly dropped The registered unemployment rate in January 2021 was 6.9% [438]\n\n\nEthnicity and citizenship\nEstonia is generally ethnically homogeneous, with 13 of its 15 counties having over 80% ethnic Estonian populations; the most homogeneous county is Hiiumaa, where 98.4% of residents are ethnic Estonians However, in Harju County, which includes the capital Tallinn, and Ida-Viru County, the demographic makeup is more diverse due to a significant Russian-speaking minority Ethnic Estonians make up around 60% of the population in Harju County and only about 20% in Ida-Viru, where the Russian-speaking community forms nearly 70% of residents This ethnic Russian minority comprises about 24% of Estonia's total population, largely a result of Soviet-era immigration, and exists alongside recent Ukrainian refugees who arrived in 2022, now representing around 6% of the national population [441]\n\n\nCities and countryside\nSettlement patterns in Estonia are characterized by a variety of populated areas classified based on historical traditions, demographic factors, and socio-economic functions According to the Estonian government's regulations established in 2004, populated areas in Estonia are categorized as follows: küla (village), alevik (small town), alev (town), and linn (city) A küla is typically a sparsely populated area or a densely populated settlement with fewer than 300 permanent residents An alevik generally has at least 300 permanent residents, while both alev and linn are classified as densely populated areas with at least 1,000 residents As of 2024, Estonia has 47 cities, 13 towns, 186 small towns, and 4,457 villages, with Tallinn being the capital and largest city, located on the northern coast along the Gulf of Finland [449]\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in Estonia (2021) [453]\n\n\nLanguages\nThe official language, Estonian, is a Finnic language belonging to the Uralic language family, one of the few language groups in Europe that is not of Indo-European origin Following the restoration of independence, Estonian was established as the sole official state language To enforce this, the Language Inspectorate was created to oversee compliance with the Language Act [470]\n\n\nEducation\nEstonia ranks as one of the top-performing countries in education, particularly among European nations According to the 2018 PISA report, Estonian students placed 1st in Europe and performed exceptionally well globally, ranking 5th in reading, 8th in mathematics, and 4th in sciences [480] [481] Estonia also boasts one of the highest adult education levels in the industrialized world, with 89% of adults aged 25–64 having completed at least a high school degree [482] The University of Tartu, the nation's highest-ranked and oldest university, holds a prominent position in Northern Europe, ranking 285th globally according to the QS World University Rankings [483]\n\n\nCulture\nWhile Estonia's culture has also been influenced by neighboring Baltic, Germanic, and Slavic traditions, as well as the historical powers of Germany, Sweden, and Russia, the emphasis on indigenous practices highlights a strong connection to the land and community This blend of influences has led Estonia to aspire to be recognized as a Nordic state, embracing both its unique identity and broader regional connections [491] [492]\n\n\nHolidays and traditions\nEstonia observes 11 public holidays with mandatory days off and celebrates 12 additional national holidays each year [495] The Estonian National Day is the Independence Day, observed on 24 February to commemorate the 1918 Estonian Declaration of Independence Another pivotal holiday, Võidupüha, is celebrated on 23 June in remembrance of the 1919 Battle of Cēsis victory This holiday often merges with Jaanipäev, or Midsummer, one of the oldest and most widely celebrated events in Estonia, tracing back to pagan fertility rites On Midsummer's Eve, Estonians traditionally gather around bonfires near the village swing to enjoy dancing, singing, and other festivities Christmas (jõulud) is also deeply cherished in Estonia, its traditions blending ancient winter solstice customs with Christian and modern holiday practices [496]\n\n\nMusic and dance\nEstonian music has a rich history that traces back to early mentions in medieval chronicles, with the first known reference appearing in Saxo Grammaticus' Gesta Danorum around 1179 Saxo describes Estonian warriors singing at night before battle [498] The oldest form of folk songs in Estonia, known as regilaulud (runic songs), followed a distinct poetic metre shared with other Baltic Finns These traditional songs remained widespread until the 18th century, after which rhythmic folk songs began to take their place [499] However, interest in traditional music saw a revival in the 20th century, largely thanks to the works of composer Veljo Tormis, who infused Estonian folklore into his compositions, bringing renewed attention to regilaulud [500]\n\n\nMythology and folklore\nEstonian folklore and mythology are rooted in pre-Christian animistic beliefs and shaped by various cultural influences over centuries Many folk tales are told to this day and some have been written down and translated to make them accessible to an international readership [514] While much of Estonia's ancient mythology is scattered across fragments of oral tradition, some of the oldest myths are believed to have survived in traditional runic songs One such song narrates the birth of the world, where a bird lays three eggs, from which emerge the Sun, the Moon, and the Earth [515] These songs describe a world centered on a cosmic pillar or tree, often depicted with the Milky Way (Linnutee or \"Birds' Way\" in Estonian) stretching across the sky as a branch of this world tree (Ilmapuu) and serving as a pathway for birds, which were thought to transport the souls of the deceased to the otherworld [516]\n\n\nLiterature and philosophy\nThe oldest records of written Estonian date from the 13th century [524] Written Estonian poetry emerged during 17th–18th centuries, with authors such as Reiner Brockmann and Käsu Hans Despite this, few notable works of literature were written until the 19th century and the beginning of an Estonian national awakening Kristjan Jaak Peterson, the first recognized Estonian poet, emerged in the early 19th century, inspiring figures such as Friedrich Robert Faehlmann and Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald to preserve Estonian folk poetry and produce the Kalevipoeg, the Estonian national epic [525] It is written in the Kalevala meter, a largely lyrical form of folk poetry based on syllabic quantity [526] The national awakening also spurred the rise of national romantic poetry, with Lydia Koidula as its foremost figure [527]\n\n\nArt\nEstonian art reflects European artistic trends while incorporating distinctly local themes, including folklore, landscapes, and motifs inspired by national identity Traces of Estonian artistry date back to the Stone Age, with decorated bone artifacts, amber pendants, and early figurines During the Middle Ages, Gothic art became prominent, visible in medieval churches on Saaremaa and exemplified by Bernt Notke's Danse Macabre in St Nicholas Church, Tallinn [543] Renaissance painter Michael Sittow, trained in the Early Netherlandish style, was Estonia's first internationally recognized artist, known for his masterful portraiture in European courts [544]\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe architecture of Estonia reflects a blend of northern European styles shaped by local traditions and materials Estonian folk architecture is distinguished by single farms set within open landscapes, typically including a smoke sauna The primary materials, timber and boulders, were used extensively in traditional Estonian structures The rehielamu, a unique Estonian farmhouse style, remains prominent in some South Estonian villages Estonia is also home to many hill forts from pre-Christian times, [551] [552] medieval castles, churches, and countryside structures such as manor houses, mills, and inns Traditional construction methods are still practiced in some regions [553] [554] [555]\n\n\nTheatre, cinema and animation\nEstonian theatre has a long and evolving history, with the earliest recorded performances dating back to the 16th century By 1784, the German playwright August von Kotzebue helped establish an amateur theatre in Tallinn, and five years later, the Estonian language made its debut on stage in Kotzebue's play The Father's Expectation The Tallinn City Theatre, opened in 1809, became Estonia's first professional theatre, performing German but also some Estonian-language works [563] However, a distinctly Estonian theatre culture began to take shape with the development of song and drama societies, including the landmark 1870 performance of Lydia Koidula's Cousin from Saaremaa by the Vanemuine Cultural Society, which marked the birth of Estonian national theatre [564]\n\n\nMedia and entertainment\nEstonia's media and entertainment industry is characterized by a diverse array of outlets, notable press freedom, and a growing influence in music and television Media landscape includes numerous weekly newspapers and magazines, along with nine domestic television channels and a variety of radio stations Estonia consistently ranks among the top nations for press freedom, achieving 6th place on the Press Freedom Index globally in 2024 and 8th place in 2023, according to Reporters Without Borders [575] [576] [577] Two main news agencies operate in Estonia: the Baltic News Service (BNS), a private news agency established in 1990 that covers the Baltic states, and ETV24, part of Eesti Rahvusringhääling, Estonia’s publicly funded broadcasting organization Established in 2007, Eesti Rahvusringhääling consolidates radio and television services previously provided by Eesti Raadio and Eesti Televisioon under the Estonian National Broadcasting Act [578] [579]\n\n\nCuisine\nA strong connection to the land and sea has shaped Estonian cuisine, reflecting its historical agrarian roots, with a focus on local, seasonal ingredients and simple preparation Traditionally, food was based on what was available from local farms and the sea, a custom still evident in modern Estonian dishes For centuries, hunting and fishing were integral to Estonian food culture, and while these are now enjoyed more as hobbies, locally sourced meats and fish remain central to traditional Estonian meals Most common staples include black bread, pork, potatoes, and dairy products, and these foods are enjoyed in a variety of forms across seasons Estonians especially value fresh ingredients in spring and summer, incorporating berries, herbs, and vegetables straight from the garden, while winter meals often feature preserved jams, pickles, and mushrooms In coastal and lakeside areas, fish plays a significant role The national fish, Baltic herring (räim), along with sprat (kilu), are well-loved and often served in spiced forms as appetizers or open sandwiches, such as the iconic kiluvõileib, an open sandwich with sprats on black bread [584]\n\n\nSports\nSports play an integral role in Estonian culture, with Estonian athletes participating prominently in early Olympic Games Today, popular sports include basketball, beach volleyball, skiing, and football Estonia has also produced world-class cyclists and maintains extensive indoor and outdoor facilities for a range of sports [588] [589] A unique contribution to global sports from Estonia is kiiking, invented by Ado Kosk in 1993 This sport uses a modified swing, where the goal is to complete a full 360-degree rotation [590]\n\n\nSee

It shares its borders with Latvia to the south, Russia to the east, and the Gulf of Finland to the north. With a population of approximately 1.3 million people, Estonia is a small but significant nation in the region. The country has a rich history, dating back to the medieval period, and has been influenced by various cultures, including Germanic, Baltic, and Slavic traditions.\n\n## Geography\nEstonia is situated on the East European Plain, with a total area of 45,335 square kilometers (17,504 square miles). The country's terrain is mostly flat, with some hills and forests. The highest point in Estonia is the Suur Munamägi hill, which stands at 318 meters (1,043 feet) above sea level. The climate in Estonia is temperate, with cold winters and mild summers.\n\n## History\nEstonia has a long and complex history, with various periods of occupation and independence. The country was first inhabited by the ancient Finno-Ugric peoples, who settled in the region around 8000 BCE. The Estonians developed a distinct culture and language, which was later influenced by the Viking Age and the medieval trade with the Hanseatic League.\n\n## Viking Age and Ancient Chiefdoms\nThe North Estonian coast was strategically located on the route from the Varangians to the Greeks, making it a trade hub while also being both a target and starting point for many raids. Coastal Estonians, particularly Oeselians from Saaremaa, adopted Viking lifestyle. Several Scandinavian sagas referred to major confrontations with Estonians, notably when in the early 7th century \"Estonian Vikings\" defeated and killed Ingvar Harra, the King of Swedes.\n\n## Crusades and the Catholic Era\nIn 1199, Pope Innocent III declared a crusade to \"defend the Christians of Livonia\", fighting reached Estonia in 1206, when Danish King Valdemar II unsuccessfully invaded Saaremaa. The German Livonian Brothers of the Sword, who had previously subjugated Livonians, Latgalians, and Selonians, started campaigning against the Estonians in 1208. A major leader of the Estonian resistance was Lembitu, an elder of Sakala County, but in 1217 the Estonians suffered a significant defeat in the Battle of St Matthew's Day, where Lembitu was killed.\n\n## Reformation and the Livonian War\nThe Reformation began in central Europe in 1517, and soon spread northward to Livonia despite some opposition by the Livonian Order. Protestant preaching began actively in Tallinn in 1524, leading the town council to align with the Reformation by the following year. Similar events unfolded in Tartu, where tensions arose with Catholic Bishop Johann Blankenfeld, resulting in iconoclastic riots that damaged Catholic churches and monasteries in both cities.\n\n## Russian Rule and National Awakening\nFollowing the Polish-Swedish War, which began in 1600, Estonia was annexed by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The country was later occupied by Sweden and then Russia. The Russian rule had a lasting impact on Estonia, with the introduction of the Cyrillic alphabet and the suppression of the Estonian language. However, the national awakening movement, which emerged in the 19th century, aimed to preserve the Estonian language and culture.\n\n## World War I and Independence\nDuring World War I, over 100,000 Estonian men were mobilized into the Imperial Russian Army. The turmoil of war led to civil unrest, and the Russian imperial government resisted expanding Estonian political rights. In 1917, following the February Revolution, the Russian Provisional Government finally conceded to Estonian demands, and the Estonian Provincial Assembly was formed through democratic elections.\n\n## Interwar Period and World War II\nEstonia gained its independence in 1920, but it was short-lived. The country was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940, followed by the German occupation during World War II. The war had a devastating impact on Estonia, with significant loss of life and destruction of infrastructure.\n\n## Post-War Period\nFollowing the war, Estonia was occupied by the Soviet Union, and the country was incorporated into the Soviet Union as the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic.

length and follows the exact outline structure using \"#\" for main sections and \"##\" for subsections.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Estonia\" following this outline:\n\n\nName\nThe name Estonia (Estonian: Eesti  [ˈeˑstʲi] ⓘ) has been connected to Aesti, a people first mentioned by Ancient Roman historian Tacitus around 98 CE Some modern historians believe he was referring to Balts, while others have proposed that the name then applied to the whole eastern Baltic Sea region [29] Scandinavian sagas and Viking runestones [30] referring to Eistland are the earliest known sources that definitely use the name in its modern geographic meaning [31] From Old Norse the toponym spread to other Germanic vernaculars and reached literary Latin by the end of 12th century [32] [33]\n\n\nHistory\nThe oldest known settlement in Estonia is the Pulli settlement; according to radiocarbon dating, it was settled around 11,000 years ago [34] The earliest human habitation during the Mesolithic period is connected to the Kunda culture [35] Around 5300 BCE, ceramics appear of the neolithic period, known as Narva culture [36] This was followed by the Comb Ceramic culture around 3900 BC, bringing early agriculture and sophisticated religious art [37] Starting from around 2800 BC the Corded Ware culture appeared; this included new activities like primitive farming and animal husbandry [38] The Comb Ceramic and Corded Ware cultures coexisted in Estonia for a millennium, before eventually blending into a Bronze Age Estonian culture [37] Archaeological estimates place the population within Estonian territory at a modest level, with approximately 6,000 inhabitants in 3900 BC, rising to around 10,000 by 2000 BC [37]\n\n\nPrehistory\nThe oldest known settlement in Estonia is the Pulli settlement; according to radiocarbon dating, it was settled around 11,000 years ago [34] The earliest human habitation during the Mesolithic period is connected to the Kunda culture [35] Around 5300 BCE, ceramics appear of the neolithic period, known as Narva culture [36] This was followed by the Comb Ceramic culture around 3900 BC, bringing early

territory at a modest level, with approximately 6,000 inhabitants in 3900 BC, rising to around 10,000 by 2000 BC [37]\n\n\nViking Age and ancient chiefdoms\nNorth Estonian coast was strategically located on the route from the Varangians to the Greeks, making Estonia a trade hub while also being both a target and starting point for many raids Coastal Estonians, particularly Oeselians from Saaremaa, adopted Viking lifestyle [50] [51] Several Scandinavian sagas referred to major confrontations with Estonians, notably when in the early 7th century \"Estonian Vikings\" defeated and killed Ingvar Harra, the King of Swedes [52] [53] The Salme ship burials dating from mid-8th century have been suggested as a possible starting point for the Viking Age in Europe [54] [55]\n\n\nCrusades and the Catholic Era\nIn 1199, Pope Innocent III declared a crusade to \"defend the Christians of Livonia\" [74] Fighting reached Estonia in 1206, when Danish King Valdemar II unsuccessfully invaded Saaremaa The German Livonian Brothers of the Sword, who had previously subjugated Livonians, Latgalians, and Selonians, started campaigning against the Estonians in 1208, and over the next few years both sides made numerous raids and counter-raids A major leader of the Estonian resistance was Lembitu, an elder of Sakala County, but in 1217 the Estonians suffered a significant defeat in the Battle of St Matthew's Day, where Lembitu was killed In 1219, Valdemar II landed at Lindanise, defeated the Estonians in the Battle of Lyndanisse, and started conquering Northern Estonia [75] [76] The next year, Sweden invaded Western Estonia, but were repelled by the Oeselians In 1223, a major revolt ejected the Germans and Danes from the whole of Estonia, except Tallinn, but the crusaders soon resumed their offensive, and in 1227, Saaremaa was the last maakond (county) to surrender [77] [78]\n\n\nReformation and the Livonian War\nThe Reformation began in central Europe in 1517, and soon spread northward to Livonia despite some opposition by the Livonian Order [92] Protestant preaching began actively in Tallinn in 1524, leading the town council to align with the Reformation by the following year Similar events unfolded in Tartu, where tensions arose with Catholic Bishop Johann Blankenfeld, resulting in iconoclastic riots that damaged Catholic churches and monasteries in both cities By the late 1520s, most Estonian towns had embraced the Reformation, although Catholic influence remained stronger in Viljandi, Haapsalu, and Vana-Pärnu Unlike the cities, rural areas were slower to adopt Protestantism, with Catholic influence persisting among local nobility and peasants well into the 1530s [93] [94] With the Reformation, church services began to be conducted in vernacular language, which initially meant Low German, but already from the 1530s onward the regular religious services were held in Estonian [93] [95] Early Estonian-language Protestant texts emerged, including Wanradt–Koell Catechism in 1535 [96]\n\n\nSwedish and Russian rule\nThe Polish–Swedish War, which began in 1600, unleashed years of further devastation across Estonia The Battle of Weissenstein (Paide) in 1604 marked a critical turning point, where Lithuanian hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz led a smaller Polish-Lithuanian force of 2,300 to a decisive victory against a Swedish army of 6,000 Despite this victory and others, the wars stretched on until 1629, concluding with Sweden gaining Livonia, including Southern Estonia and Northern Latvia, altering the power balance in the Baltic region [106] In addition, Danish Saaremaa was transferred to Sweden in 1645 [107] During the Russo-Swedish War, Russia in 1656 captured eastern parts of Estonia, including Tartu, holding it until the Treaty of Cardis was concluded in 1661 [108] The wars had halved the population of Estonia from about 250–270,000 people in the mid 16th century to 115–120,000 in the 1630s [109]\n\n\nNational Awakening\nThe reopening of the university in Tartu in 1802 gave opportunities for higher education to both Baltic German and a growing number of Estonian students Among the latter were first public proponents of Estonian nationalism, such as young poet Kristjan Jaak Peterson At the same time, the nationalist ideas of Johann Gottfried Herder greatly influenced the Baltic German intelligentsia to see the value in the native Estonian culture [122] The resulting Estophile movement gave rise to the Learned Estonian Society and other scientific societies, supported Estonian-language education and founded the first newspapers in the Estonian language They also began to value and collect the Estonian folklore, including surviving pre-Christian myths and traditions [123] Another sign of a rising Estonian national consciousness was a mass movement in South Estonia to convert to Eastern Orthodoxy in the 1840s, following a famine and a promise for being rewarded with land [124]\n\n\nIndependence\nDuring World War I, over 100,000 Estonian men were mobilized into the Imperial Russian Army Of these, approximately 8,000 to 10,000 perished, and one in five suffered injuries [138] In the turmoil of war, ideas for establishing an Estonian national army began to take root, while the shortages and hardships on the home front led to civil unrest Despite repeated appeals and promises, the Russian imperial government resisted expanding Estonian political rights In 1917, following the February Revolution, the Russian Provisional Government finally conceded to Estonian demands Estonia was granted autonomy, and the Estonian Provincial Assembly was formed through democratic elections In addition, the territory of autonomous Estonia was expanded to include the Estonian-speaking areas of Livonia [139]\n\n\nWorld War II\nA week before the outbreak of World War II, on 23 August 1939, Nazi Germany and the Stalinist Soviet Union signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact In the pact's secret protocol Poland, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Finland were divided between USSR and Germany into \"spheres of influence\", with Estonia assigned to the Soviet \"sphere\" [162] On 24 September 1939, the Soviet dictator Stalin presented the Estonian government an ultimatum demanding that Estonia immediately sign a treaty that would allow the USSR to establish military bases in Estonia, or else face war The Estonian government decided to avoid military conflict, and a \"mutual assistance treaty\" was signed in Moscow on 28 September 1939 [163] On 14 June 1940 the Soviet Union instituted a full naval and air blockade on Estonia On the same day, the airliner Kaleva was shot down by the Soviet Air Force On 16 June, the USSR presented an ultimatum demanding completely free passage of the Red Army into Estonia and the establishment of a pro-Soviet government Feeling that resistance was hopeless, the Estonian government complied and, on the next day, the whole country was occupied [164] [165] The Independent Signal Battalion was the only unit of the Estonian Army to offer armed resistance to occupation [166] [167] On 6 August 1940, Estonia was formally annexed by the Soviet Union as the Estonian SSR [168]\n\n\nSoviet occupation\nFollowing the renewed Soviet occupation of Estonia, thousands of Estonians once again joined the Forest Brothers to resist Soviet rule This armed resistance was particularly intense in the immediate post-war years, but Soviet forces eventually wore it down through relentless attrition tactics, bringing an end to organized armed resistance by the 1960s [189] The Soviet regime also intensified its policy of collectivisation, forcing Estonian farmers to abandon private agriculture and join state-run collectives When locals resisted, authorities launched a campaign of terror, culminating in March 1949 with operation Priboi – the mass deportation of around 20,000 Estonians to the gulag system in Siberia [190] Full collectivization followed shortly after, marking a new phase of Soviet control over Estonia's economy [169] [191]\n\n\nIndependence restored\nThe introduction of perestroika by the Soviet government in 1987 reopened the possibility for political activism in Estonia, sparking the Singing Revolution, a peaceful movement towards independence [205] One of the first major acts of resistance was the Phosphorite War, an environmental protest against Soviet plans to establish large phosphate mines in Virumaa [206] On 23 August 1987, the Hirvepark meeting in Tallinn called for the public disclosure of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and its secret protocols which had led to Estonia's loss of independence Although direct demands for independence were not yet made, organizers aimed to reinforce the continuity of the Estonian state and prepare the foundation for a restoration based on legal principles [207] [208]\n\n\nGeography\nEstonia is in Europe, [d] on the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea, on the East European Plain [226] [227] [228] It is bordered to the north by the Gulf of Finland across from Finland, to the west by the sea across from Sweden, to the south by Latvia, and to the east by Lake Peipsi and Russia [229] It covers an area of 45,335 km2 (17,504 sq mi), of which 4.6% is internal waters [226]\n\n\nGeology\nEstonia is located on the northwestern part of the East European Platform, bordering the Fennoscandian Shield Estonia's bedrock consists of two main layers: the crystalline basement and the sedimentary cover These are further classified into three distinct geological complexes The crystalline basement, composed of granites, gneisses, and other crystalline rocks, formed during the Proterozoic This is overlain by a sedimentary cover of Paleozoic rocks, including limestones and sandstones Above this, a quaternary surface layer is mainly composed of unconsolidated sediments such as gravels, sands, and clays, which formed in the Cenozoic [233]\n\n\nClimate\nEstonia experiences a transitional climate that lies between continental and maritime influences, characterized as a humid continental climate Located at the same latitude as the northern tips of central Sweden and Scotland, Estonia's climate is notably milder than that of other regions at the same latitude due to the moderating effects of the Atlantic Ocean and the North Atlantic current In North America, Estonia aligns with the average latitude of the Labrador Peninsula and the southern coast of Alaska, making its climate unique for its geographical position The prevailing weather patterns in Estonia are significantly influenced by active cyclonic activity in the northern Atlantic, particularly from the Icelandic low This results in strong winds, precipitation, and abrupt temperature fluctuations, especially during the autumn and winter months The westerly winds carry moist maritime air far into the continental interior, leading to milder temperatures in winter and slightly cooler conditions in summer compared to continental areas further away from the coast Coastal regions and islands generally enjoy a milder climate, with the Baltic Sea moderating temperatures, keeping coastal areas warmer in winter and cooler in summer [237]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nEstonia is recognized as one of the most biodiverse regions in Europe, particularly for its size and latitude [227] The country boasts a diverse array of climatic and soil conditions, as well as an abundance of both marine and freshwater ecosystems This rich biodiversity allows for the survival of many species that have become extinct in most other European nations [243] Protected areas cover 19.4% of Estonian land and 23% of its total area together with territorial sea The country is home to nearly 4,000 protected natural objects, which encompass six national parks, 231 nature conservation areas, and 154 landscape reserves [244]\n\n\nEnvironment\nThe environmental status in Estonia is generally favorable, but issues persist regarding pollution from transportation, the preservation of biodiversity, and the protection of water bodies Lake Peipus, the largest transboundary lake in Europe, faces significant ecological challenges Monitoring data from 2009 to 2023 reveal that the lake's water quality indicators are predominantly in poor ecological condition In 2023, unusually high water temperatures promoted the release of phosphorus from lake sediments, further deteriorating water quality Additionally, water transparency in both Estonian and Russian parts of the lake has shown a declining trend, signaling ongoing environmental stress [258]\n\n\nPolitics\nEstonia is a unitary parliamentary republic where the unicameral parliament, the Riigikogu, serves as the legislature and the government acts as the executive branch [262] The Riigikogu comprises 101 members elected for four-year terms by proportional representation, with voting rights granted to citizens over 18 years of age The parliament holds several key responsibilities: it approves the national government, passes legal acts and the state budget, and exercises parliamentary oversight Additionally, upon the president's recommendation, the Riigikogu appoints the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the chair of the Bank of Estonia, the Auditor General, the Chancellor of Justice, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces [263] [264]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nEstonia is a unitary country with a single-tier local government system Local affairs are managed autonomously by local governments Since administrative reform in 2017, there are in total 79 local governments, including 15 towns and 64 rural municipalities All municipalities have equal legal status and form part of a maakond (county), which is an administrative subunit of the state [275] Representative body of local authorities is municipal council, elected at general direct elections for a four-year term The council appoints local government For towns, the head of the local government is linnapea (mayor) and vallavanem for parishes For additional decentralization the local authorities may form municipal districts with limited authority, currently those have been formed in Tallinn and Hiiumaa and several other parishes [276]\n\n\nLaw\nThe Constitution of Estonia is the fundamental law, establishing the constitutional order based on five principles: human dignity, democracy, rule of law, social state, and the Estonian identity [278] Estonia has a civil law legal system based on the Germanic legal model [279] The court system has a three-level structure The first instance are county courts which handle all criminal and civil cases, and administrative courts which hear complaints about government and local officials, and other public disputes The second instance are district courts which handle appeals about the first instance decisions [280] The Supreme Court is the court of cassation, conducts constitutional review, and has 19 members [281] The judiciary is independent, judges are appointed for life, and can be removed from office only when convicted of a crime [282] The justice system has been rated among the most efficient in the European Union by the EU Justice Scoreboard [283]\n\n\nForeign relations\nEstonia has actively pursued close relations with Western countries since restoring its independence in 1991 As a member of the League of Nations from 1921 and a United Nations member since 1991, [288] [289] Estonia quickly integrated into European and transatlantic frameworks, joining NATO and the European Union in 2004 [289] In 2007, Estonia joined the Schengen Area, and in 2011 the Eurozone [289] Tallinn hosts the European Union Agency for large-scale IT systems, which has been operational since 2012, [290] and Estonia held the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union in the second half of 2017 [291] Estonia is also a member of the OECD, OSCE, WTO, IMF, the Council of the Baltic Sea States, [289] [292] [293] and served as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for a two-year term beginning in January 2020 [294]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Estonian Defence Forces consist of land forces, navy, and air force The current national military service is compulsory for healthy men between ages of 18 and 28, with conscripts serving 8- or 11-month tours of duty, depending on their education and position provided by the Defence Forces [311] The peacetime size of the Estonian Defence Forces is about 6,000 persons, with half of those being conscripts The planned wartime size of the Defence Forces is 60,000 personnel, including 21,000 personnel in high readiness reserve [312] Since 2015, the Estonian defence budget has been over 2% of GDP, fulfilling its NATO defence spending obligation [313]\n\n\nLaw enforcement and emergency services\nEstonia is a country largely protected from major natural disasters due to its geographic location, avoiding the risks of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes and tropical cyclones However, certain natural events, such as forest fires, minor floods in low-lying areas, and occasional small earthquakes, still pose localized challenges The most significant recent disaster in Estonia's history was the 1994 sinking of the MS Estonia in the Baltic Sea, remaining the deadliest peactime maritime disaster in Europe [329]\n\n\nEconomy\nEstonia is a developed country with an advanced, high-income economy that was among the fastest-growing in the EU since its entry in 2004 [332] With a GDP (PPP) per capita of $46,385 in 2023, ranked 40th globally by the IMF, [15] Estonia ranks highly in international rankings for quality of life, [333] education, [334] [335] press freedom, [336] digitalisation of public services, [337] [338] the prevalence of technology companies, [339] and maintains very high rankings in the Human Development Index [340] One of the world's most digitally-advanced societies, [341] in 2005 Estonia became the first state to hold elections over the Internet, and in 2014, the first state to provide e-residency [342] Universal health care, [343] free education, [344] and the longest paid maternity leave in the OECD [345] are additional hallmarks of Estonia's social infrastructure.\n\n\nPublic policy\nEstonia's economy continues to benefit from a transparent government and policies that sustain a high level of economic freedom, ranking 6th globally and 2nd in Europe [355] [356] The rule of law remains strongly buttressed and enforced by an independent and efficient judicial system A simplified tax system with flat rates and low indirect taxation, openness to foreign investment, and a liberal trade regime have supported the resilient and well-functioning economy [357] As of May 2018 [update], the Ease of Doing Business Index by the World Bank Group places the country 16th in the world [358] The strong focus on the IT sector through its e-Estonia program has led to much faster, simpler and efficient public services where for example filing a tax return takes less than five minutes and 98% of banking transactions are conducted through the internet [359] [360] Estonia has the 13th lowest business bribery risk in the world, according to TRACE Matrix [361]\n\n\nTransportation\nEstonia's transportation system is an essential part of the country's infrastructure, facilitating both domestic and international movement of goods and people The primary modes of transportation include road, rail, maritime, and air transport, each contributing significantly to the economy and accessibility of the region The Port of Tallinn is one of the largest maritime enterprises in the Baltic Sea, catering to both cargo and passenger traffic Among the facilities is the ice-free port of Muuga, located near Tallinn, which boasts modern transhipment capabilities, a high-capacity grain elevator, chill and frozen storage, and enhanced oil tanker offloading facilities [371] Estonian shipping company Tallink operates a fleet of Baltic Sea cruiseferries and ropax ships, making it the largest passenger and cargo shipping operator in the Baltic Sea, with routes connecting Estonia to Finland and Sweden [372] The ferry lines to Estonian islands are operated by TS Laevad and Kihnu Veeteed [373]\n\n\nNatural resources and mining\nEstonia is relatively rich in materials that could potentially serve as natural resources, although many are not found in economically viable quantities or face technical and environmental challenges that hinder their extraction The country has large oil shale (particularly kukersite) and limestone deposits In addition to oil shale and limestone, Estonia also has large reserves of phosphorite, pitchblende, and granite that currently are not mined, or not mined extensively [385] The underground resources may include gold, molybdenum, platinum, vanadium, and strontium Future potential resources are thought to include diatomaceous earth and uranium There are also indications of oil near Hiiumaa and natural gas reserves in North Estonia Currently, the most significant resources being exploited in Estonia are oil shale and phosphorite, along with natural building materials such as sand, gravel, limestone, and clay [386]\n\n\nEnergy\nThe energy sector in Estonia has historically been dominated by the oil shale industry, which has played a crucial role in electricity production since the 1920s The oil shale industry, concentrated in Virumaa, produces around 73% of the entire country's electricity [392] In recent years, however, there has been a significant growth in renewable energy generation, alongside ongoing discussions regarding the potential future use of nuclear energy The largest producer of electricity and thermal energy in Estonia is the state-owned company Eesti Energia Oil shale remains the primary energy source in Estonia, primarily utilized for electricity generation and heating, particularly in Narva In addition to electricity, Estonia has been increasingly producing oil from this resource, with production volumes steadily rising Other energy sources include peat, firewood, hydroelectric and wind energy, solar panels, and imported natural and liquefied gas, as well as coal [393]\n\n\nAgriculture, fishery and forestry\nAgriculture is one of Estonia's traditional economic sectors, historically crucial to the country's economy Following Estonia's re-independence, agricultural significance in the economy declined sharply as large Soviet-era collective farms were dismantled and privatized In recent years, large enterprises have once again become dominant, while smaller farms focus on niche markets, organic farming, and rural tourism Recent years have seen an increase in Estonia's cultivated land, with approximately 1.05 million hectares of arable land and 0.24 million hectares of natural grasslands recorded by 2019 [407] [408] Estonia has one of the largest average farm sizes within the European Union at 62 hectares per farm, with around 78% of farmland owned by entities managing at least 100 hectares – far above the EU average of 49% for this ownership category [409] Estonia ranks second in Europe, following Austria, in the proportion of farmland under organic cultivation [410]\n\n\nIndustry and services\nIndustry serves as a foundational pillar of Estonia's economy, with the manufacturing sector being the largest segment, accounting for approximately 15% of the national GDP This sector provides employment for around one-fifth of the workforce, equating to about 120,000 individuals Additionally, the export turnover of industrial enterprises typically represents around two-thirds of Estonia's total export volume [415] Food, construction, and electronic industries are currently among the most important branches of Estonia's industry [416] Key branches within Estonia's industry include food production, construction, and electronics, with the construction industry alone employing over 80,000 people in 2007, roughly 12% of the total workforce [417] The machinery and chemical industries are also significant, primarily concentrated in Ida-Viru County and around Tallinn.\n\n\nScience and technology\nEarly scientific contributions in Estonia began with indigenous knowledge of agricultural practices and the medicinal effects of herbal remedies The University of Tartu has catalyzed further scientific advancements, leading to contributions by biologists such as Karl Ernst von Baer, Alexander von Middendorff, Jakob von Uexküll and Eerik Kumari Esteemed chemists like Wilhelm Ostwald and Carl Schmidt, economist Ragnar Nurkse, mathematician Edgar Krahn, medical researchers Ludvig Puusepp and Nikolay Pirogov also made significant contributions Notable physicists included Georg Wilhelm Richmann and Thomas Johann Seebeck, while Rein Taagepera advanced political science, and Endel Tulving and Risto Näätänen made strides in psychology The field of semiotics has been pioneered by Juri Lotman.\n\n\nDemographics\nThe Estonian society has undergone considerable changes since the country had restored full independence in 1991 [436] Some of the more notable changes have taken effect in the level of stratification and distribution of family income The Gini coefficient has held steadily higher than the European Union average (31 in 2009), [437] although it has clearly dropped The registered unemployment rate in January 2021 was 6.9% [438]\n\n\nEthnicity and citizenship\nEstonia is generally ethnically homogeneous, with 13 of its 15 counties having over 80% ethnic Estonian populations; the most homogeneous county is Hiiumaa, where 98.4% of residents are ethnic Estonians However, in Harju County, which includes the capital Tallinn, and Ida-Viru County, the demographic makeup is more diverse due to a significant Russian-speaking minority Ethnic Estonians make up around 60% of the population in Harju County and only about 20% in Ida-Viru, where the Russian-speaking community forms nearly 70% of residents This ethnic Russian minority comprises about 24% of Estonia's total population, largely a result of Soviet-era immigration, and exists alongside recent Ukrainian refugees who arrived in 2022, now representing around 6% of the national population [441]\n\n\nCities and countryside\nSettlement patterns in Estonia are characterized by a variety of populated areas classified based on historical traditions, demographic factors, and socio-economic functions According to the Estonian government's regulations established in 2004, populated areas in Estonia are categorized as follows: küla (village), alevik (small town), alev (town), and linn (city) A küla is typically a sparsely populated area or a densely populated settlement with fewer than 300 permanent residents An alevik generally has at least 300 permanent residents, while both alev and linn are classified as densely populated areas with at least 1,000 residents As of 2024, Estonia has 47 cities, 13 towns, 186 small towns, and 4,457 villages, with Tallinn being the capital and largest city, located on the northern coast along the Gulf of Finland [449]\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in Estonia (2021) [453]\n\n\nLanguages\nThe official language, Estonian, is a Finnic language belonging to the Uralic language family, one of the few language groups in Europe that is not of Indo-European origin Following the restoration of independence, Estonian was established as the sole official state language To enforce this, the Language Inspectorate was created to oversee compliance with the Language Act [470]\n\n\nEducation\nEstonia ranks as one of the top-performing countries in education, particularly among European nations According to the 2018 PISA report, Estonian students placed 1st in Europe and performed exceptionally well globally, ranking 5th in reading, 8th in mathematics, and 4th in sciences [480] [481] Estonia also boasts one of the highest adult education levels in the industrialized world, with 89% of adults aged 25–64 having completed at least a high school degree [482] The University of Tartu, the nation's highest-ranked and oldest university, holds a prominent position in Northern Europe, ranking 285th globally according to the QS World University Rankings [483]\n\n\nCulture\nWhile Estonia's culture has also been influenced by neighboring Baltic, Germanic, and Slavic traditions, as well as the historical powers of Germany, Sweden, and Russia, the emphasis on indigenous practices highlights a strong connection to the land and community This blend of influences has led Estonia to aspire to be recognized as a Nordic state, embracing both its unique identity and broader regional connections [491] [492]\n\n\nHolidays and traditions\nEstonia observes 11 public holidays with mandatory days off and celebrates 12 additional national holidays each year [495] The Estonian National Day is the Independence Day, observed on 24 February to commemorate the 1918 Estonian Declaration of Independence Another pivotal holiday, Võidupüha, is celebrated on 23 June in remembrance of the 1919 Battle of Cēsis victory This holiday often merges with Jaanipäev, or Midsummer, one of the oldest and most widely celebrated events in Estonia, tracing back to pagan fertility rites On Midsummer's Eve, Estonians traditionally gather around bonfires near the village swing to enjoy dancing, singing, and other festivities Christmas (jõulud) is also deeply cherished in Estonia, its traditions blending ancient winter solstice customs with Christian and modern holiday practices [496]\n\n\nMusic and dance\nEstonian music has a rich history that traces back to early mentions in medieval chronicles, with the first known reference appearing in Saxo Grammaticus' Gesta Danorum around 1179 Saxo describes Estonian warriors singing at night before battle [498] The oldest form of folk songs in Estonia, known as regilaulud (runic songs), followed a distinct poetic metre shared with other Baltic Finns These traditional songs remained widespread until the 18th century, after which rhythmic folk songs began to take their place [499] However, interest in traditional music saw a revival in the 20th century, largely thanks to the works of composer Veljo Tormis, who infused Estonian folklore into his compositions, bringing renewed attention to regilaulud [500]\n\n\nMythology and folklore\nEstonian folklore and mythology are rooted in pre-Christian animistic beliefs and shaped by various cultural influences over centuries Many folk tales are told to this day and some have been written down and translated to make them accessible to an international readership [514] While much of Estonia's ancient mythology is scattered across fragments of oral tradition, some of the oldest myths are believed to have survived in traditional runic songs One such song narrates the birth of the world, where a bird lays three eggs, from which emerge the Sun, the Moon, and the Earth [515] These songs describe a world centered on a cosmic pillar or tree, often depicted with the Milky Way (Linnutee or \"Birds' Way\" in Estonian) stretching across the sky as a branch of this world tree (Ilmapuu) and serving as a pathway for birds, which were thought to transport the souls of the deceased to the otherworld [516]\n\n\nLiterature and philosophy\nThe oldest records of written Estonian date from the 13th century [524] Written Estonian poetry emerged during 17th–18th centuries, with authors such as Reiner Brockmann and Käsu Hans Despite this, few notable works of literature were written until the 19th century and the beginning of an Estonian national awakening Kristjan Jaak Peterson, the first recognized Estonian poet, emerged in the early 19th century, inspiring figures such as Friedrich Robert Faehlmann and Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald to preserve Estonian folk poetry and produce the Kalevipoeg, the Estonian national epic [525] It is written in the Kalevala meter, a largely lyrical form of folk poetry based on syllabic quantity [526] The national awakening also spurred the rise of national romantic poetry, with Lydia Koidula as its foremost figure [527]\n\n\nArt\nEstonian art reflects European artistic trends while incorporating distinctly local themes, including folklore, landscapes, and motifs inspired by national identity Traces of Estonian artistry date back to the Stone Age, with decorated bone artifacts, amber pendants, and early figurines During the Middle Ages, Gothic art became prominent, visible in medieval churches on Saaremaa and exemplified by Bernt Notke's Danse Macabre in St Nicholas Church, Tallinn [543] Renaissance painter Michael Sittow, trained in the Early Netherlandish style, was Estonia's first internationally recognized artist, known for his masterful portraiture in European courts [544]\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe architecture of Estonia reflects a blend of northern European styles shaped by local traditions and materials Estonian folk architecture is distinguished by single farms set within open landscapes, typically including a smoke sauna The primary materials, timber and boulders, were used extensively in traditional Estonian structures The rehielamu, a unique Estonian farmhouse style, remains prominent in some South Estonian villages Estonia is also home to many hill forts from pre-Christian times, [551] [552] medieval castles, churches, and countryside structures such as manor houses, mills, and inns Traditional construction methods are still practiced in some regions [553] [554] [555]\n\n\nTheatre, cinema and animation\nEstonian theatre has a long and evolving history, with the earliest recorded performances dating back to the 16th century By 1784, the German playwright August von Kotzebue helped establish an amateur theatre in Tallinn, and five years later, the Estonian language made its debut on stage in Kotzebue's play The Father's Expectation The Tallinn City Theatre, opened in 1809, became Estonia's first professional theatre, performing German but also some Estonian-language works [563] However, a distinctly Estonian theatre culture began to take shape with the development of song and drama societies, including the landmark 1870 performance of Lydia Koidula's Cousin from Saaremaa by the Vanemuine Cultural Society, which marked the birth of Estonian national theatre [564]\n\n\nMedia and entertainment\nEstonia's media and entertainment industry is characterized by a diverse array of outlets, notable press freedom, and a growing influence in music and television Media landscape includes numerous weekly newspapers and magazines, along with nine domestic television channels and a variety of radio stations Estonia consistently ranks among the top nations for press freedom, achieving 6th place on the Press Freedom Index globally in 2024 and 8th place in 2023, according to Reporters Without Borders [575] [576] [577] Two main news agencies operate in Estonia: the Baltic News Service (BNS), a private news agency established in 1990 that covers the Baltic states, and ETV24, part of Eesti Rahvusringhääling, Estonia’s publicly funded broadcasting organization Established in 2007, Eesti Rahvusringhääling consolidates radio and television services previously provided by Eesti Raadio and Eesti Televisioon under the Estonian National Broadcasting Act [578] [579]\n\n\nCuisine\nA strong connection to the land and sea has shaped Estonian cuisine, reflecting its historical agrarian roots, with a focus on local, seasonal ingredients and simple preparation Traditionally, food was based on what was available from local farms and the sea, a custom still evident in modern Estonian dishes For centuries, hunting and fishing were integral to Estonian food culture, and while these are now enjoyed more as hobbies, locally sourced meats and fish remain central to traditional Estonian meals Most common staples include black bread, pork, potatoes, and dairy products, and these foods are enjoyed in a variety of forms across seasons Estonians especially value fresh ingredients in spring and summer, incorporating berries, herbs, and vegetables straight from the garden, while winter meals often feature preserved jams, pickles, and mushrooms In coastal and lakeside areas, fish plays a significant role The national fish, Baltic herring (räim), along with sprat (kilu), are well-loved and often served in spiced forms as appetizers or open sandwiches, such as the iconic kiluvõileib, an open sandwich with sprats on black bread [584]\n\n\nSports\nSports play an integral role in Estonian culture, with Estonian athletes participating prominently in early Olympic Games Today, popular sports include basketball, beach volleyball, skiing, and football Estonia has also produced world-class cyclists and maintains extensive indoor and outdoor facilities for a range of sports [588] [589] A unique contribution to global sports from Estonia is kiiking, invented by Ado Kosk in 1993 This sport uses a modified swing, where the goal is to complete a full 360-degree rotation [590]\n\n\nSee also\n59°N 26°E﻿ / ﻿59°N 26°E﻿ / 59;

The exchange was facilitated by the German and American governments, who worked together to negotiate the release of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\n\n**Background**\n\nDuring the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union routinely exchanged prisoners, who were typically spies, military officers, or other government agents. The end of the Cold War in 1991 resulted in a marked decline in espionage activities—and, accordingly, prisoner exchanges—between the U.S and Soviet Union's successor, the Russian Federation. The most recent mass prisoner swap between the two countries occurred in 2010, when ten Russian sleeper agents detained in the U.S as part of the so-called \"Illegals Program\" were exchanged for four prisoners held in Russia.\n\n**Prisoner Exchange**\n\nDuring a February 2024 trip by German chancellor Olaf Scholz to Washington, D.C., the German and American governments began working on how to negotiate an agreement that would include the freeing of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. The negotiations involved various stakeholders, including the Russian government, the Western countries, and other interested parties.\n\n**Negotiations and Preparation**\n\nThe negotiations and preparation for the prisoner exchange were complex and involved multiple parties.

Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre of Norway described the exchange as a difficult dilemma, stating that \"normally, we want people who are arrested and suspected of crimes in our countries to be investigated and possibly brought to trial according to our principles of the rule of law... But you have to make that assessment in a broader context... And that broader context indicated that it was the right thing to do.\"\n\nThe Kremlin press service stated that \"the decision to sign pardoning decrees was made with the goal of returning Russian citizens who were detained and imprisoned in foreign countries.\" It was noted that the Russian side is grateful to the leadership of all countries that assisted in the preparation of the exchange and is also thankful to Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko for pardoning Rico Krieger.\n\nFreed as part of a prisoner swap between Russia and the West, the opposition figures, Andrei Pivovarov, Vladimir Kara-Murza, and Ilya Yashin, had mixed feelings about the deal. Kara-Murza stated that article 61 of the Constitution of Russia forbids to deport citizens if they do not approve, and none of them did so or was even asked to do so. Yashin added that he is Russian, a Russian politician, and sees himself as a patriot, whose place is in Russia.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan praised the \"historic\" operation and congratulated the National Intelligence Organization staff who took part in the operation. \"Türkiye will continue to be the center of peaceful diplomacy in line with the vision of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan,\" he added.\n\n**Organizations**\n\nReporters Without Borders stated that Gershkovich \"should have never spent a single day in a Russian prison\", and their director of campaigns Rebecca Vincent called his arrest \"outrageous\". The Spanish branch of RWB, which had campaigned for Pablo González's right to a trial in Poland, asked him for explanations.

{"title": "Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting", "content": "\nBackground\nAs of November 30, 2012, 456 children were enrolled in kindergarten through fourth grade at Sandy Hook Elementary School [13] The school's security protocols had recently been upgraded, requiring visitors to be individually admitted after visual and identification review by video monitor Doors to the school were locked at 9:30 a.m each day, after morning arrivals [14]\n\n\nEvents\nWounded:\n\n\nMurder of Nancy Lanza\nSometime before 9:30 a.m EST on December 14, 2012, Adam Lanza shot and killed his mother Nancy Lanza, aged 52, with a .22-caliber Savage Mark II rifle at their Newtown home [31] [32] Investigators later found her body in her bed, clad in pajamas, with four gunshot wounds to her head [33] [34] Lanza then drove to Sandy Hook Elementary School in his mother's car [31] [35]\n\n\nMass shooting begins\nShortly after 9:35 a.m., armed with his mother's Bushmaster XM15-E2S rifle and ten magazines with 30 rounds each, [2] [3] [4] [36] [37] Lanza shot his way through a glass panel next to the locked front entrance doors of the school [38] [39] [40] [41] He was wearing black clothing, yellow earplugs, sunglasses, [42] a black hat, and an olive green utility vest [36] [43] Initial reports that he was wearing body armor were incorrect [44] Some of those present heard the initial shots on the school intercom system, which was being used for morning announcements [14]\n\n\nClassroom shootings\nLanza entered Room 8, a first-grade classroom where Lauren Rousseau, a substitute teacher, had herded her first-grade students to the back of the room, and was trying to hide them in a bathroom, when Lanza forced his way into the classroom [51] Rousseau, Rachel D'Avino (a behavioral therapist who had been employed for a week at the school to work with a special needs student), and fifteen students in Rousseau's class were killed Fourteen of the children were dead at the scene; one injured child was taken to a hospital for treatment but was later pronounced dead [48] Most of the teachers and students were found crowded together in the bathroom [57] A six-year-old girl, the sole survivor, was found by police in the classroom following the shooting [48] She hid in a corner of the classroom's bathroom during the shooting [58] Her family's pastor said she survived by playing dead When she reached her mother, she said, \"Mommy, I'm okay, but all my friends are dead.\" The child described the shooter as \"someone who she felt was angry, who she felt was mad.\" [59] [60] A girl who was hiding in a bathroom along with two teachers told police that she heard a boy in the classroom screaming, \"Help me! I don't want to be here!\", to which Lanza responded, \"Well, you're here,\" followed by \"hammering\" sounds [61]\n\n\nSurvivors' eyewitness accounts\nFirst-grade teacher Kaitlin Roig, 29 years old, hid fifteen students in a bathroom and barricaded the door, telling them to be completely quiet to remain safe [71] [72] It is believed that Lanza bypassed her classroom, which was the first classroom on the left side of the hallway Following a lockdown drill weeks earlier, Roig had failed to remove a piece of black construction paper covering the small window in her classroom door Lanza may have assumed that Roig's classroom was empty because the door was closed and the window was covered [51]\n\n\nShooter's suicide\nThe police heard the final shot at 9:40:03 a.m [77] [78] [79] They believed that it was Lanza shooting himself in the lower rear portion of his head with the Glock 20SF in classroom 10 [80] Lanza's body was found wearing a pale green pocket vest over a black polo shirt over a black T-shirt, along with black sneakers, black fingerless gloves, black socks, and a black canvas belt [80] [65] Other objects found in the vicinity of Lanza included a black Boonie hat and thin frame sunglasses The Glock was found, apparently jammed, near Lanza, and the rifle was found several feet away from him [80] A 9mm SIG Sauer P226, which had not been fired during the incident, was found on Lanza [81]\n\n\nImmediate aftermath\nAuthorities determined that Lanza reloaded frequently during the shootings, sometimes firing only 15 rounds from a 30-round magazine [82] He shot all but two of his victims multiple times [83] [84] Most of the shooting took place in two first-grade classrooms near the entrance of the school [85] The students among the victims totaled eight boys and twelve girls, all either six or seven years old, [86] and the six adults were all women who worked at the school Bullets were also found in at least three cars parked outside the school, leading police to believe that he fired at a teacher who was standing near a window [51] [82]\n\n\nPolice response\nThe first call to 911 was around 9:35 a.m Newtown 911 police dispatch first broadcast that there was a shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School (SHES) at 9:36 a.m., about 30 seconds after they received the first call [87] Connecticut State Police (CSP) were dispatched at 9:37 a.m [88] Newtown police arrived at the school street at 9:39 a.m., approximately three-and-a-half minutes after the 911 call, and Connecticut State Police arrived at the school street at 9:46 a.m Newtown police first entered the school at 9:45 a.m., approximately nine minutes after the first 911 call and approximately ten minutes after the shooting started This was approximately five minutes after the last shot was heard [48] No shots were fired by the police [78] [89]\n\n\nInvestigation\nInvestigators did not find a suicide note or any messages referring to the planning of the attack [65] [95] Janet Robinson, superintendent of Newtown schools, said she had not found any connection between Lanza's mother and the school, in contrast to initial media reports that said Lanza's mother had worked there [5] [96] Police also investigated whether Lanza was the person who had been in an altercation with four staff members at Sandy Hook School the day before the massacre It was presumed that he killed two of the four staff members involved in the altercation (the principal and the psychologist) and wounded the third (the lead teacher) in the attack; the fourth staff member was not at the school that day [97] The state police said they did not know of any reports about any altercations at the school [98]\n\n\nOn-site\nInvestigators did not find a suicide note or any messages referring to the planning of the attack [65] [95] Janet Robinson, superintendent of Newtown schools, said she had not found any connection between Lanza's mother and the school, in contrast to initial media reports that said Lanza's mother had worked there [5] [96] Police also investigated whether Lanza was the person who had been in an altercation with four staff members at Sandy Hook School the day before the massacre It was presumed that he killed two of the four staff members involved in the altercation (the principal and the psychologist) and wounded the third (the lead teacher) in the attack; the fourth staff member was not at the school that day [97] The state police said they did not know of any reports about any altercations at the school [98]\n\n\nOff-site\nShortly after the shooting, police announced that Lanza used the rifle to kill the victims at the school [115] At a press conference on December 15, Dr H Wayne Carver II, the Chief Medical Examiner of Connecticut, was asked about the wounds, and replied \"All the ones that I know of at this point were caused by the long weapon.\" [5] [116] [98] When asked if the children suffered before dying, Carver replied by stating that \"If so, not for very long\" [117] Carver, whose office autopsied the victims and who personally performed seven, said the injuries were \"devastating\" and that parents identified their children from photographs to spare them the sight All the child victims were first-graders, and all were killed with the Bushmaster XM15 Carver said the bullets used were \"designed in such a fashion the energy is deposited in the tissue so the bullet stays in.\" [5] [86]\n\n\nFinal reports\nThe final report of the State Attorney summarizing the investigation into the shooting was published on November 25, 2013 It concluded that Adam Lanza had acted alone, and that the case was closed The report noted that \" [Lanza] had a familiarity with and access to firearms and ammunition and an obsession with mass murders, in particular the April 1999 shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado.\" The report did not identify a specific motive for the shooting, stating, \"The evidence clearly shows that the shooter planned his actions, including the taking of his own life, but there is no clear indication why he did so, or why he targeted Sandy Hook elementary school.\" [137] [138]\n\n\nState Attorney's report\nThe final report of the State Attorney summarizing the investigation into the shooting was published on November 25, 2013 It concluded that Adam Lanza had acted alone, and that the case was closed The report noted that \" [Lanza] had a familiarity with and access to firearms and ammunition and an obsession with mass murders, in particular the April 1999 shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado.\" The report did not identify a specific motive for the shooting, stating, \"The evidence clearly shows that the shooter planned his actions, including the taking of his own life, but there is no clear indication why he did so, or why he targeted Sandy Hook elementary school.\" [137] [138]\n\n\nReport of the Office of the Child Advocate\nThe Report of the Office of the Child Advocate concluded: \"There was not one thing that was necessarily the tipping point driving Lanza to commit the Sandy Hook shooting Rather there was a cascade of events, many self-imposed, that included: loss of school; absence of work; disruption of the relationship with his one friend; virtually no personal contact with family; virtually total and increasing isolation; fear of losing his home and of a change in his relationship with Mrs Lanza, his only caretaker and connection; worsening OCD; depression and anxiety; profound and possibly worsening anorexia; and an increasing obsession with mass murder occurring in the total absence of any engagement with the outside world Adam increasingly lived in an alternate universe in which ruminations about mass shootings were his central preoccupation\" [143]\n\n\nPerpetrator\nAdam Peter Lanza (April 22, 1992 – December 14, 2012) lived with his mother, Nancy Lanza, in Newtown, 5 miles (8 km) from the elementary school [145] He did not have a criminal record [8] [146] [147] He had access to guns through his mother, who was described as a \"gun enthusiast who owned at least a dozen firearms\" [148] [149] [150] [151] She often took her two sons to a local shooting range, where they learned to shoot [152] [153] Lanza's father has said that he does not believe Nancy feared Lanza She did not confide any fear of Lanza to her sister or to her best friend, slept with her bedroom door unlocked, and kept guns in the house [154]\n\n\nEducation\nLanza attended Sandy Hook Elementary School for four and a half years [155] He began at Newtown Middle School in 2004, [156] but according to his mother was \"wracked by anxiety\" [157] She told friends that her son started getting upset in middle school because of frequent classroom changes during the day The movement and noise were too stimulating and made him anxious At one point, his anxiety was so intense that she took him to the emergency room at Danbury Hospital Because of the smaller class sizes, his mother moved him to a parochial school, St Rose of Lima [158] According to a classmate at St Rose of Lima, he entered \"late in the school year\", and he left in June 2005 [157]\n\n\nEarly living, developmental and mental health problems\nLanza was born and partially raised in Kingston, New Hampshire, about 7 miles (10 km) southwest of Exeter, 30 miles (50 km) east of Manchester, and 50 miles (80 km) north of Boston While living in New Hampshire at the time, Lanza exhibited developmental challenges before the age of three These included communication and sensory difficulties, socialization delays, and repetitive behaviors He was seen by the New Hampshire Birth to Three intervention program and referred to special education preschool services [162] Once at elementary school, he was diagnosed with a sensory-integration disorder The sensory-processing disorder does not have official status by the medical community as a formal diagnosis but is a common characteristic of autism [163] His anxiety affected his ability to attend school and in 8th grade he was placed on \"homebound\" status, which is reserved for children who are too disabled, even with supports and accommodations, to attend school [164]\n\n\nFinal months\nAccording to a report by the Office of the Child Advocate in Connecticut in November 2014, Lanza may have had anorexia nervosa The authors wrote that \"Anorexia can produce cognitive impairment and it is likely that anorexia combined with an autism spectrum disorder and OCD compounded Lanza's risk for suicide\" [177] They also noted that at the time of his death, Lanza \"was anorexic (he was six feet tall (183 cm) and weighed 112 pounds (51 kg)), to the point of malnutrition and resultant brain damage.\" [178]\n\n\nLegal proceedings\nIn January 2015, the families of two of the first-graders who died in the shooting filed a lawsuit against the city of Newtown and the Newtown Board of Education alleging inadequate security at the school [184] On May 7, 2018, judgement was published on the side of the defendants, concluding in part that \"the court has decided that the plaintiffs' claims against the defendants are barred by governmental immunity\" [185] In March 2015, it was announced that parents of children and teachers killed in the shooting had filed lawsuits against the estate of Nancy Lanza The suits were based on a claim that she did not properly secure her firearms, which allowed her son, a person with mental health issues, to gain access to them The attorneys representing the families said Lanza was believed to have had homeowner's insurance on her home worth more than $1 million and they were seeking compensation based on that [186] The case was settled in December 2015, with sixteen plaintiffs sharing a $1.5m payment from the estate [187]\n\n\nRemington\nOn December 15, 2014, nine families of the 26 victims of the shooting filed a class-action lawsuit in Connecticut against Bushmaster, Remington Arms, Camfour, a distributor of firearms, and the now-closed East Windsor store, Riverview Sales, where the gunman's rifle was purchased, seeking \"unspecified\" damages, [190] claiming an exemption from the 2005 Federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) that would normally disallow such a suit as lacking standing [191] [192] The plaintiffs allege that the XM15-E2S is suitable only for military and policing applications and that Bushmaster inappropriately marketed it to civilians [192] In January 2015, Bushmaster's attorneys petitioned to have the suit moved to federal court because, although the shooting took place in Connecticut, it is located in North Carolina [184] In February 2015, the victims' families' attorneys made a motion to move the suit back to state court [193] On April 14, 2016, a Connecticut court denied the defendants' motion to summarily dismiss the case [194] Lawyers for the defense filed a second motion for dismissal a month later [195] On October 14, 2016, the defendants' motion to dismiss the lawsuit was granted The judge ruled the complaint was not valid per federal and Connecticut laws [196] [197] [198] [199]\n\n\nAlex Jones\nOn April 17, 2018, radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was sued for defamation by three parents whose children were killed in the shooting Prior to this, Jones said that the Sandy Hook shooting was \"completely fake\" and a \"giant hoax\" perpetrated by opponents of the Second Amendment [206] Jones claims he later believed the shooting was real [207] On May 23, 2018, six more families sued Jones for his claims [208] Jones was found to be in contempt of court by a Texas judge even before the trial started, failing to produce witnesses and materials relevant to the procedures Consequently, Jones and InfoWars were fined a total of $126,000 in October and December 2019 [209]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe school was closed indefinitely following the shooting, partially because it remained a crime scene [220] Sandy Hook students returned to classes on January 3, 2013, at Chalk Hill Middle School in nearby Monroe at the town's invitation Chalk Hill at the time was an unused facility, refurbished after the shooting, with desks and equipment brought in from Sandy Hook Elementary The Chalk Hill school was temporarily

"Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nAs of November 30, 2012, 456 children were enrolled in kindergarten through fourth grade at Sandy Hook Elementary School [13] The school's security protocols had recently been upgraded, requiring visitors to be individually admitted after visual and identification review by video monitor Doors to the school were locked at 9:30 a.m each day, after morning arrivals [14]\n\n\nEvents\nWounded:\n\n\nMurder of Nancy Lanza\nSometime before 9:30 a.m EST on December 14, 2012, Adam Lanza shot and killed his mother Nancy Lanza, aged 52, with a .22-caliber Savage Mark II rifle at their Newtown home [31] [32] Investigators later found her body in her bed, clad in pajamas, with four gunshot wounds to her head [33] [34] Lanza then drove to Sandy Hook Elementary School in his mother's car [31] [35]\n\n\nMass shooting begins\nShortly after 9:35 a.m., armed with his mother's Bushmaster XM15-E2S rifle and ten magazines with 30 rounds each, [2] [3] [4] [36] [37] Lanza shot his way through a glass panel next to the locked front entrance doors of the school [38] [39] [40] [41] He was wearing black clothing, yellow earplugs, sunglasses, [42] a black hat, and an olive green utility vest [36] [43] Initial reports that he was wearing body armor were incorrect [44] Some of those present heard the initial shots on the school intercom system, which was being used for morning announcements [14]\n\n\nClassroom shootings\nLanza entered Room 8, a first-grade classroom where Lauren Rousseau, a substitute teacher, had herded her first-grade students to the back of the room, and was trying to hide them in a bathroom, when Lanza forced his way into the classroom [51] Rousseau, Rachel D'Avino (a behavioral therapist who had been employed for a week at the school to work with a special needs student), and fifteen students in Rousseau's class were killed Fourteen of the children were dead at the scene; one injured child was taken to a hospital for treatment but was later pronounced dead [48] Most of the teachers and students were found crowded together in the bathroom [57] A six-year-old girl, the sole survivor, was found by police in the classroom following the shooting [48] She hid in a corner of the classroom's bathroom during the shooting [58] Her family's pastor said she survived by playing dead When she reached her mother, she said, \"Mommy, I'm okay, but all my friends are dead.\" The child described the shooter as \"someone who she felt was angry, who she felt was mad.\" [59] [60] A girl who was hiding in a bathroom along with two teachers told police that she heard a boy in the classroom screaming, \"Help me! I don't want to be here!\", to which Lanza responded, \"Well, you're here,\" followed by \"hammering\" sounds [61]\n\n\nSurvivors' eyewitness accounts\nFirst-grade teacher Kaitlin Roig, 29 years old, hid fifteen students in a bathroom and barricaded the door, telling them to be completely quiet to remain safe [71] [72] It is believed that Lanza bypassed her classroom, which was the first classroom on the left side of the hallway Following a lockdown drill weeks earlier, Roig had failed to remove a piece of black construction paper covering the small window in her classroom door Lanza may have assumed that Roig's classroom was empty because the door was closed and the window was covered [51]\n\n\nShooter's suicide\nThe police heard the final shot at 9:40:03 a.m [77] [78] [79] They believed that it was Lanza shooting himself in the lower rear portion of his head with the Glock 20SF in classroom 10 [80] Lanza's body was found wearing a pale green pocket vest over a black polo shirt over a black T-shirt, along with black sneakers, black fingerless gloves, black socks, and a black canvas belt [80] [65] Other objects found in the vicinity of Lanza included a black Boonie hat and thin frame sunglasses The Glock was found, apparently jammed, near Lanza, and the rifle was found several feet away from him [80] A 9mm SIG Sauer P226, which had not been fired during the incident, was found on Lanza [81]\n\n\nImmediate aftermath\nAuthorities determined that Lanza reloaded frequently during the shootings, sometimes firing only 15 rounds from a 30-round magazine [82] He shot all but two of his victims multiple times [83] [84] Most of the shooting took place in two first-grade classrooms near the entrance of the school [85] The students among the victims totaled eight boys and twelve girls, all either six or seven years old, [86] and the six adults were all women who worked at the school Bullets were also found in at least three cars parked outside the school, leading police to believe that he fired at a teacher who was standing near a window [51] [82]\n\n\nPolice response\nThe first call to 911 was around 9:35 a.m Newtown 911 police dispatch first broadcast that there was a shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School (SHES) at 9:36 a.m., about 30 seconds after they received the first call [87] Connecticut State Police (CSP) were dispatched at 9:37 a.m [88] Newtown police arrived at the school street at 9:39 a.m., approximately three-and-a-half minutes after the 911 call, and Connecticut State Police arrived at the school street at 9:46 a.m Newtown police first entered the school at 9:45 a.m., approximately nine minutes after the first 911 call and approximately ten minutes after the shooting started This was approximately five minutes after the last shot was heard [48] No shots were fired by the police [78] [89]\n\n\nInvestigation\nInvestigators did not find a suicide note or any messages referring to the planning of the attack [65] [95] Janet Robinson, superintendent of Newtown schools, said she had not found any connection between Lanza's mother and the school, in contrast to initial media reports that said Lanza's mother had worked there [5] [96] Police also investigated whether Lanza was the person who had been in an altercation with four staff members at Sandy Hook School the day before the massacre It was presumed that he killed two of the four staff members involved in the altercation (the principal and the psychologist) and wounded the third (the lead teacher) in the attack; the fourth staff member was not at the school that day [97] The state police said they did not know of any reports about any altercations at the school [98]\n\n\nOn-site\nInvestigators did not find a suicide note or any messages referring to the planning of the attack [65] [95] Janet Robinson, superintendent of Newtown schools, said she had not found any connection between Lanza's mother and the school, in contrast to initial media reports that said Lanza's mother had worked there [5] [96] Police also investigated whether Lanza was the person who had been in an altercation with four staff members at Sandy Hook School the day

attack; the fourth staff member was not at the school that day [97] The state police said they did not know of any reports about any altercations at the school [98]\n\n\nOff-site\nShortly after the shooting, police announced that Lanza used the rifle to kill the victims at the school [115] At a press conference on December 15, Dr H Wayne Carver II, the Chief Medical Examiner of Connecticut, was asked about the wounds, and replied \"All the ones that I know of at this point were caused by the long weapon.\" [5] [116] [98] When asked if the children suffered before dying, Carver replied by stating that \"If so, not for very long\" [117] Carver, whose office autopsied the victims and who personally performed seven, said the injuries were \"devastating\" and that parents identified their children from photographs to spare them the sight All the child victims were first-graders, and all were killed with the Bushmaster XM15 Carver said the bullets used were \"designed in such a fashion the energy is deposited in the tissue so the bullet stays in.\" [5] [86]\n\n\nFinal reports\nThe final report of the State Attorney summarizing the investigation into the shooting was published on November 25, 2013 It concluded that Adam Lanza had acted alone, and that the case was closed The report noted that \" [Lanza] had a familiarity with and access to firearms and ammunition and an obsession with mass murders, in particular the April 1999 shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado.\" The report did not identify a specific motive for the shooting, stating, \"The evidence clearly shows that the shooter planned his actions, including the taking of his own life, but there is no clear indication why he did so, or why he targeted Sandy Hook elementary school.\" [137] [138]\n\n\nState Attorney's report\nThe final report of the State Attorney summarizing the investigation into the shooting was published on November 25, 2013 It concluded that Adam Lanza had acted

the taking of his own life, but there is no clear indication why he did so, or why he targeted Sandy Hook elementary school.\" [137] [138]\n\n\nReport of the Office of the Child Advocate\nThe Report of the Office of the Child Advocate concluded: \"There was not one thing that was necessarily the tipping point driving Lanza to commit the Sandy Hook shooting Rather there was a cascade of events, many self-imposed, that included: loss of school; absence of work; disruption of the relationship with his one friend; virtually no personal contact with family; virtually total and increasing isolation; fear of losing his home and of a change in his relationship with Mrs Lanza, his only caretaker and connection; worsening OCD; depression and anxiety; profound and possibly worsening anorexia; and an increasing obsession with mass murder occurring in the total absence of any engagement with the outside world Adam increasingly lived in an alternate universe in which ruminations about mass shootings were his central preoccupation\" [143]\n\n\nPerpetrator\nAdam Peter Lanza (April 22, 1992 – December 14, 2012) lived with his mother, Nancy Lanza, in Newtown, 5 miles (8 km) from the elementary school [145] He did not have a criminal record [8] [146] [147] He had access to guns through his mother, who was described as a \"gun enthusiast who owned at least a dozen firearms\" [148] [149] [150] [151] She often took her two sons to a local shooting range, where they learned to shoot [152] [153] Lanza's father has said that he does not believe Nancy feared Lanza She did not confide any fear of Lanza to her sister or to her best friend, slept with her bedroom door unlocked, and kept guns in the house [154]\n\n\nEducation\nLanza attended Sandy Hook Elementary School for four and a half years [155] He began at Newtown Middle School in 2004, [156] but according to his mother was \"wracked by anxiety\" [157] She told friends that her son started getting upset in middle school because of frequent classroom changes during the day The movement and noise were too stimulating and made him anxious At one point, his anxiety was so intense that she took him to the emergency room at Danbury Hospital Because of the smaller class sizes, his mother moved him to a parochial school, St Rose of Lima [158] According to a classmate at St Rose of Lima, he entered \"late in the school year\", and he left in June 2005 [157]\n\n\nEarly living, developmental and mental health problems\nLanza was born and partially raised in Kingston, New Hampshire, about 7 miles (10 km) southwest of Exeter, 30 miles (50 km) east of Manchester, and 50 miles (80 km) north of Boston While living in New Hampshire at the time, Lanza exhibited developmental challenges before the age of three These included communication and sensory difficulties, socialization delays, and repetitive behaviors He was seen by the New Hampshire Birth to Three intervention program and referred to special education preschool services [162] Once at elementary school, he was diagnosed with a sensory-integration disorder The sensory-processing disorder does not have official status by the medical community as a formal diagnosis but is a common characteristic of autism [163] His anxiety affected his ability to attend school and in 8th grade he was placed on \"homebound\" status, which is reserved for children who are too disabled, even with supports and accommodations, to attend school [164]\n\n\nFinal months\nAccording to a report by the Office of the Child Advocate in Connecticut in November 2014, Lanza may have had anorexia nervosa The authors wrote that \"Anorexia can produce cognitive impairment and it is likely that anorexia combined with an autism spectrum disorder and OCD compounded Lanza's risk for suicide\" [177] They also noted that at the time of his death, Lanza \"was anorexic (he was six feet tall (183 cm) and weighed 112 pounds (51 kg)), to the point of malnutrition and resultant brain damage.\" [178]\n\n\nLegal proceedings\nIn January 2015, the families of two of the first-graders who died in the shooting filed a lawsuit against the city of Newtown and the Newtown Board of Education alleging inadequate security at the school [184] On May 7, 2018, judgement was published on the side of the defendants, concluding in part that \"the court has decided that the plaintiffs' claims against the defendants are barred by governmental immunity\" [185] In March 2015, it was announced that parents of children and teachers killed in the shooting had filed lawsuits against the estate of Nancy Lanza The suits were based on a claim that she did not properly secure her firearms, which allowed her son, a person with mental health issues, to gain access to them The attorneys representing the families said Lanza was believed to have had homeowner's insurance on her home worth more than $1 million and they were seeking compensation based on that [186] The case was settled in December 2015, with sixteen plaintiffs sharing a $1.5m payment from the estate [187]\n\n\nRemington\nOn December 15, 2014, nine families of the 26 victims of the shooting filed a class-action lawsuit in Connecticut against Bushmaster, Remington Arms, Camfour, a distributor of firearms, and the now-closed East Windsor store, Riverview Sales, where the gunman's rifle was purchased, seeking \"unspecified\" damages, [190] claiming an exemption from the 2005 Federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) that would normally disallow such a suit as lacking standing [191] [192] The plaintiffs allege that the XM15-E2S is suitable only for military and policing applications and that Bushmaster inappropriately marketed it to civilians [192] In January 2015, Bushmaster's attorneys petitioned to have the suit moved to federal court because, although the shooting took place in Connecticut, it is located in North Carolina [184] In February 2015, the victims' families' attorneys made a motion to move the suit back to state court [193] On April 14, 2016, a Connecticut court denied the defendants' motion to summarily dismiss the case [194] Lawyers for the defense filed a second motion for dismissal a month later [195] On October 14, 2016, the defendants' motion to dismiss the lawsuit was granted The judge ruled the complaint was not valid per federal and Connecticut laws [196] [197] [198] [199]\n\n\nAlex Jones\nOn April 17, 2018, radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was sued for defamation by three parents whose children were killed in the shooting Prior to this, Jones said that the Sandy Hook shooting was \"completely fake\" and a \"giant hoax\" perpetrated by opponents of the Second Amendment [206] Jones claims he later believed the shooting was real [207] On May 23, 2018, six more families sued Jones for his claims [208] Jones was found to be in contempt of court by a Texas judge even before the trial started, failing to produce witnesses and materials relevant to the procedures Consequently, Jones and InfoWars were fined a total of $126,000 in October and December 2019 [209]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe school was closed indefinitely following the shooting, partially because it remained a crime scene [220] Sandy Hook students returned to classes on January 3, 2013, at Chalk Hill Middle School in nearby Monroe at the town's invitation Chalk Hill at the time was an unused facility, refurbished after the shooting, with desks and equipment brought in from Sandy Hook Elementary The Chalk Hill school was temporarily renamed \"Sandy Hook\" [221] [222] [223] The University of Connecticut created a scholarship for the surviving children of the shootings [224]\n\n\nResponses\nPresident Barack Obama gave a televised address on the day of the shootings: \"We're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics.\" [234] Obama expressed \"enormous sympathy for families that are affected\" [235] [236] [237] He also ordered flags to be flown at half-staff at the White House and other U.S federal government facilities worldwide in respect of the victims [238] On December 16, Obama traveled to Newtown where he met with victims' families and spoke at an interfaith vigil [239]\n\n\nGun control\nThe shooting prompted renewed debate about gun control in the United States, including proposals for making the background-check system universal, and for new federal and state legislation banning the sale and manufacture of certain types of semi-automatic firearms and magazines with more than ten rounds of ammunition [250]\n\n\nVideo games\nA renewed debate about the effects violent video games have on young people began soon

{"title": "Elden_Ring", "content": "\nGameplay\nElden Ring is an action role-playing game set in third-person perspective It includes elements that are similar to those in other FromSoftware-developed games, such as the Dark Souls series, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice The game is set in an open world; players can freely explore the Lands Between and its six main areas, which include Limgrave—an area of grassy plains and ancient ruins—and Caelid, a reddish wasteland home to undead monsters [1] The open world is explored using the character's mount Torrent as the main mode of transportation, though players may use fast travel outside combat Throughout the game, players encounter non-player characters (NPCs) and enemies, including demigods who rule each main area and serve as the game's main bosses [2] [3] Aside from the main areas, Elden Ring has hidden dungeons, catacombs, tunnels, and caves where players can fight bosses and gather helpful items [4]\n\n\nSynopsis\nElden Ring takes place in the Lands Between, a realm blessed by entities called outer gods Most prominent is the Greater Will, who created the Elden Ring – a collection of runes that govern physics The Greater Will's emissary, the Two Fingers, made a woman named Marika the Elden Ring's vessel, ascending her to godhood She then formed a dynasty called the Golden Order alongside a consort, the Elden Lord; two held this title: Godfrey, a barbarian who was later banished; and Radagon, Marika's male alter-ego She also planted a massive, golden tree called the Erdtree that empowers the realm's inhabitants Finally, Marika removed the Rune of Death from the Elden Ring and entrusted it to her bodyguard, Maliketh, causing the deceased not to pass on but to be reborn through the Erdtree instead However, the Golden Order also persecuted certain races: the Omens, horned human-animal hybrids, and people called Tarnished, humans not empowered by the Erdtree who were exiled from the Lands Between.\n\n\nSetting and characters\nElden Ring takes place in the Lands Between, a realm blessed by entities called outer gods Most prominent is the Greater Will, who created the Elden Ring – a collection of runes that govern physics The Greater Will's emissary, the Two Fingers, made a woman named Marika the Elden Ring's vessel, ascending her to godhood She then formed a dynasty called the Golden Order alongside a consort, the Elden Lord;

modern weapons [29] To achieve this, the developers studied the history, classic cars, and vibrant Caribbean colors \n\n\nCasting and characters\nWord of a new Far Cry game was teased in early July 2020, as actor Giancarlo Esposito has mentioned he had recently taken part in a \"huge video game\", including voice work and motion capture [33] Shortly after this, rumoured leaks of Far Cry 6's existence appeared, including screens that showed a character resembling Esposito [34]\n\n\nMusic\nPedro Bromfman composed the score for the game [37] The game's score consists of music that blends different elements, such as mixing Latin and Caribbean music It also includes the use of a lot of Caribbean percussion Regarding this, Bromfman stated, \"It's a very unique score.\" [38] Flamenco guitar, Cuban Tres, and Bolivian ronroco were used to accentuate the oppressive and somber narrative of the game [39]\n\n\nRelease\nFar Cry 6 was originally scheduled for release on February 18, 2021, on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Stadia, Windows, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S [40] [41] On October 29, 2020, Ubisoft announced that the release would be delayed due to impacts from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic [42] During Ubisoft's quarterly earnings call in February 2021, the company announced that the game would be released before September 30, 2021 [43] As part of further gameplay reveals on May 28, 2021, Ubisoft also announced the planned release date for Far Cry 6 as October 7, 2021 [44]\n\n\nReception\nFar Cry 6 received \"mixed or average\" reviews from critics, while the Xbox Series X/S version received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to review aggregator website Metacritic [49] [50] [51]\n\n\nSales\nIn Japan, the PlayStation 4 version of Far Cry 6 was the

{"title": "Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "content": "\nHistory\nThe Buccaneers joined the NFL as members of the AFC West in 1976 [6] The following year, they were moved to the NFC Central, while the other 1976 expansion team, the Seattle Seahawks, switched conferences with Tampa Bay and joined the AFC West [7] This realignment was dictated by the league as part of the 1976 expansion plan, so that both teams could play each other twice and every other NFL franchise once during their first two seasons Instead of a traditional schedule of playing each division opponent twice, the Buccaneers played every conference team once, plus the Seahawks [8]\n\n\nHugh Culverhouse era (1976–1994)\nThe Buccaneers joined the NFL as members of the AFC West in 1976 [6] The following year, they were moved to the NFC Central, while the other 1976 expansion team, the Seattle Seahawks, switched conferences with Tampa Bay and joined the AFC West [7] This realignment was dictated by the league as part of the 1976 expansion plan, so that both teams could play each other twice and every other NFL franchise once during their first two seasons Instead of a traditional schedule of playing each division opponent twice, the Buccaneers played every conference team once, plus the Seahawks [8]\n\n\nJohn McKay years (1976–1984)\nThe Buccaneers joined the NFL as members of the AFC West in 1976 [6] The following year, they were moved to the NFC Central, while the other 1976 expansion team, the Seattle Seahawks, switched conferences with Tampa Bay and joined the AFC West [7] This realignment was dictated by the league as part of the 1976 expansion plan, so that both teams could play each other twice and every other NFL franchise once during their first two seasons Instead of a traditional schedule of playing each division opponent twice, the Buccaneers played every conference team once, plus the Seahawks [8]\n\n\nGlazer family era (1995–present)\nDespite the profitability of the Buccaneers in the 1980s, Culverhouse's death in 1994 revealed a man close to bankruptcy despite having a low payroll for his team [43] His son, Miami attorney Hugh Culverhouse Jr soon sued his father's associates (Stephen Story, Jack Donlan, and Fred Cone) who had built the trust account that was meant to manage the elder Culverhouse's business (which involved a $350 million estate) after having his wife sign a post-nuptial agreement At any rate, a settlement was soon reached that gave control of the trust to Culverhouse Jr., who sold the team for $192 million Interested parties included New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner [44] and Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos, the latter of whom publicly declared he would move the team to Baltimore, as the city did not have an NFL franchise at that time [45]\n\n\nTony Dungy years (1996–2001)\nThe Glazers' deep pockets and serious commitment to fielding a winning team–in Tampa Bay–finally allowed the Bucs to become competitive The team's performance dramatically improved when the Glazers hired Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Tony Dungy as head coach [47] Additionally, the team jettisoned the old uniform designs in favor of a modern look.\n\n\nJon Gruden years (2002–2008)\nDungy was fired by the Buccaneers following a 31–9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in the Wildcard Round of 2001 [66] and soon thereafter hired as the head coach of the Indianapolis Colts, [67] while the Bucs mounted a search for his replacement that would include numerous names and rejections [68] Several potential candidates were offered the job, including University of Florida head coach (and former Buccaneers quarterback) Steve Spurrier, former New York Giants head coach Bill Parcells, and Baltimore Ravens defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis Spurrier jumped to the Redskins when he was offered the most lucrative salary package ever offered to an NFL head coach, and Parcells eventually passed on the Bucs' offer—the second time he had done so in the history of the franchise Bucs' general manager Rich McKay threw his support behind Lewis The Glazer brothers were so displeased with the selection of yet another defensive-minded coach that they overruled McKay and took control of the candidate search themselves They made it clear that their top choice was Jon Gruden; however, he was still under contract with the Oakland Raiders.\n\n\nSuper Bowl XXXVII champions (2002)\nLed by the league's top defense, the 2002 season was the Buccaneers' most successful to date Linebacker Derrick Brooks was named the NFL Defensive Player of the Year with a tendency to make big plays [73] They won the NFC South title with the team's best ever record, 12–4, and scored more points in two playoff wins over the 49ers and Eagles than in Bucs playoff history combined The Philadelphia Eagles were a thorn in Tampa Bay's side, having eliminated the Bucs in each of the last two seasons' wild card games Tampa Bay entered the game as heavy underdogs and fell behind early However, the Bucs persevered and took a ten-point lead into the fourth quarter Ronde Barber sealed the win in dramatic fashion with a late interception return for a touchdown, and a 27–10 victory [74] The Bucs then went on to rout Gruden's former team, the Raiders, who had the league's number one offense, by a score of 48–21 in Super Bowl XXXVII, nicknamed 'The Pirate Bowl' [75]\n\n\nRaheem Morris\nThe 2009 squad started out 0–7, behind Leftwich and later Josh Johnson Following their bye week, the team elevated Freeman to starting quarterback, [107] resulting in the team's first win of the season The team finished 3–13, the worst record since 1991 [108]\n\n\nGreg Schiano\nAbout three weeks after firing Raheem Morris, the Buccaneers hired Greg Schiano from Rutgers as the new head coach [119] During his introductory conference he stated \"There will be Buccaneer men, and there will be a Buccaneer Way.\" The phrase \"The Buccaneer Way\" became a slogan among fans and local media, describing the new regime and attitude The team filled out the coaching staff with new faces, including Mike Sullivan, [120] Bill Sheridan, [121] and Butch Davis [122] In 2013, Dave Wannstedt was also added as special teams coach [123] In the first day of free agency, the club signed top prospects Vincent Jackson and Carl Nicks, as well as Eric Wright [124] The $140 million committed to the team during that 24-hour period is the largest investment the Glazer family has put into the team going back almost a decade.\n\n\nLovie Smith\nOn January 1, 2014, Lovie Smith was hired as the new head coach of the Buccaneers, replacing Greg Schiano [136] Smith had previously spent 5 seasons with the Buccaneers from 1996 to 2001 coaching the linebackers under Tony Dungy [136] During his first news conference with the Bucs, Smith talked about restoring the quality of the team from the late 1990s and early 2000s: \"There was a certain brand of football you expected from us,\" Smith said \"You know we would be relentless There was a brand of football that you got from us each week at Raymond James Stadium It was hard for opponents to come in and win We have gotten away from that a little bit, and it's time .. for us to become a relevant team again.\" [137]\n\n\nDirk Koetter\nOn January 15, 2016, Dirk Koetter was promoted from offensive coordinator to become the new head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers [154] [155]\n\n\nBruce Arians years (2019–2021)\nFollowing the termination of Dirk Koetter, the Buccaneers named Bruce Arians as the 12th head coach in franchise history on January 8, 2019 Arians had been retired from coaching for a year, having spent the 2018 season in the broadcast booth [173] Because Arians was still under contract with the Arizona Cardinals through the end of the 2019 season, Tampa Bay agreed to give the Cardinals a sixth-round pick in the 2019 NFL draft for the rights to Arians, as well as receiving Arizona's seventh-round pick in the same draft On the same day it was reported the Bucs would also bring Byron Leftwich, who had served under Arians in Arizona, as offensive coordinator [174] The next day the Buccaneers announced the hiring of former Jets head coach Todd Bowles as defensive coordinator [175]\n\n\nSuper Bowl LV champions (2020)\nThe Buccaneers made arguably the biggest acquisition of the 2020 offseason when they acquired veteran quarterback Tom Brady, widely considered the greatest to ever play the position [182] [183] [184] [185] [186] [187] The offensive engine of the New England Patriots' sports dynasty from 2001 to 2019, Brady announced that he would not be re-signing with the Patriots after 20 seasons [188] and joined the Buccaneers for 2020 [189]\n\n\nTodd Bowles years (2022–present)\nOn March 30, 2022, head coach Bruce Arians suddenly resigned, with defensive coordinator Todd Bowles being named the immediate replacement [203] [204]\n\n\nDefense\nThroughout their history, the Buccaneers have been known for their suffocating defense It started with the drafting of Hall of Fame defensive end Lee Roy Selmon with their first pick ever in 1976 Three Buccaneer players have been named the AP Defensive Player of the Year, and the team has led the league in total defense on three occasions, including the 2002 championship season The team's defense was instrumental in their 2020 playoff run which led to their second Super Bowl title All five of the Buccaneers Hall of Fame inductees are defensive players or coaches.\n\n\n1978–1982\nLed by Selmon, Linebackers Dewey Selmon, Richard Wood, Dave Lewis, and Mike Washington, Mark Cotney, and Cedric Brown in the secondary, the early years Buccaneers quickly earned an identity as a defensive team Their 3–4 defense peaked in 1979 when they led the league in total defense, points allowed, and first downs allowed Lee Roy Selmon was voted NFL Defensive Player of the Year, but they eventually fell 10 points short of the Super Bowl as the offense held them back in the NFC Championship game in a 9–0 loss to the Los Angeles Rams Although 1980 was a down year, the unit made pass defense adjustments and returned in 1981 to finish No 1 in Touchdowns allowed; giving up only 10 touchdowns all season [214]\n\n\n1997–2008: The Tampa 2\nThe team drafted franchise cornerstones John Lynch in 1993, and Warren Sapp and Derrick Brooks in 1995 to go along with All-Pro linebacker Hardy Nickerson That was followed by the hiring of innovative defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin in 1996 The new-look Buccaneers set the stage for one of the greatest defensive runs in NFL history From 1997 to 2008, the Buccaneers defense finished in the league's top ten every year but one, including eight top-5 finishes, and two top-ranked efforts Kiffin along with head coach Tony Dungy created the \"Tampa 2\" defense, a modified version of the established Cover 2 scheme.\n\n\n2002 defense\nThe 2002 Buccaneers defense is widely regarded as one of the greatest defenses in NFL history, rivaled only by the 1976 Steelers, 1985 Bears, 1986 Giants, 2000 Ravens and 2010's Seattle Seahawks [215] [216] In the regular season, Tampa Bay led the league in total defense (252.8 ypg), points allowed (196), first downs allowed (14.8 pg), passing (155.6 ypg), interceptions (31), interceptions returned for touchdowns (5), opponent passer rating (48.4), and shutouts (2) They also finished third in opponent rushing average (3.8 ypc), and sixth in sacks (43) [217] Derrick Brooks was awarded AP Defensive Player of the Year as the defense led the way to a 12–4 regular season [218] The team was even better in the postseason allowing only a combined 37 points in three games – all against top ten offenses In those three playoff games, they intercepted 9 passes – returning 4 for touchdowns – and collected 11 sacks.\n\n\n2019–present: Todd Bowles' 3–4 defense\nWhen Arians was hired by the Bucs, he appointed former New York Jets head coach Todd Bowles to be the team's defensive coordinator That same offseason, the team drafted linebacker Devin White with the fifth overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, after signing outside linebacker Shaquil Barrett to a one-year, $4 million contract, and defensive end Ndamukong Suh for one year, $10 million With these acquisitions, along with linebackers Lavonte David, Carl Nassib, Jason Pierre-Paul, nose tackles Vita Vea and Beau Allen and defensive end William Gholston, Bowles implemented the 3–4 defensive scheme, with a heavy emphasis on blitzing David and White were the teams' leaders, Barrett led the team, and the league, in sacks with 19.5, and the 2019 Buccaneers finished No 1 in the league in run defense The team's defense improved next season after Suh, Barrett, and Pierre-Paul were re-signed and Antoine Winfield Jr was drafted in the second round of the 2020 NFL Draft The Buccaneers defense was a massive part of the teams' turn-around in 2020, finishing 1st in run defense, 7th in pass defense and 8th in total defense The Buccaneers pass defense improved 29th to 7th, thanks in part to their young secondary, led by Carlton Davis, Sean Murphy-Bunting, Jordan Whitehead, Winfield Jr., Ross Cockrell, Herb Miller and Mike Edwards Nicknamed, the \"Grave Diggers\", they forced two interceptions, including a pick-six by Jamel Dean, four sacks and gave up no touchdowns against 2020 NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers in Week 6, forced three interceptions against future Hall of famer Drew Brees, and five sacks and another interception against Rodgers in the NFC Championship Game In Super Bowl LV, against the league's No 1 offense led by 2018 NFL MVP Patrick Mahomes, the Buccaneers held Kansas City to season lows in points and red zone attempts, with 9 points, all from field goals, 22 first downs, and 0–3 red zone attempts They forced two interceptions, three sacks, 29 pressures, and five quarterback hits, and a 49.9 passer rating during the game  In 19 total games in 2020, the Buccaneers recorded 18 interceptions, 58 sacks, 19 forced fumbles, and 12 fumble recoveries [222]\n\n\nFacilities\nSince 1998, the Buccaneers have played their home games at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Prior to that, they had played in Tampa Stadium since their establishment.\n\n\nLogos and uniforms\nSince their inception in 1976, the Buccaneers have gone through two distinct logo/uniform eras From 1976 to 1996, the team utilized orange, red, and white uniforms with a \"Bucco Bruce\" logo Since 1997, the team has utilized red and pewter uniforms, with a \"skull and swords\" logo.\n\n\nLogos\nSince their inception in 1976, the Buccaneers have gone through two distinct logo/uniform eras From 1976 to 1996, the team utilized orange, red, and white uniforms with a \"Bucco Bruce\" logo Since 1997, the team has utilized red and pewter uniforms, with a \"skull and swords\" logo.\n\n\n1976\nShortly after the franchise was awarded, in February 1975 the team name of \"Buccaneers\" was selected, along with proposed team colors of green, orange and white The name was said to be reminiscent of José Gaspar and the Buccaneers of the Caribbean Sea, and the color orange representing the Florida citrus industry Almost immediately, the nickname \"Bucs\" became popular, but the alternative \"Bay Bucs\" failed to gain traction [226]\n\n\n1977–1991\nAfter only one season, the original orange numerals (with red outline) for the white \"away\" jerseys were reversed For 1977 and beyond, the white jerseys were revised to have red numerals with an orange outline The color swap provided better visibility, especially for television coverage purposes [236] The striped socks were dropped.\n\n\n1992–1996\nIn 1992, the Bucco Bruce logo was given a minor facelift, as part of an overall uniform refresh It resulted in a crisper and larger version, and was used for five seasons [242] The team introduced orange trousers to be worn with the white jerseys The white jerseys now had an orange collar, and would no longer be paired with white pants Most regular season home games during this period (except primetime games and selected late season games) saw white jerseys with orange pants The white on white combination would be used during preseason only.\n\n\n1997–2013\nA ballot measure to fund the construction of a new stadium passed in September 1996 As a result, the franchise was guaranteed to stay in Tampa, and the plans to design a new uniform were resurrected and reenergized [250] The Buccaneers worked with the NFL to develop a more marketable and intimidating look in order to improve the team's image Starting with the 1997 season, the primary team colors were changed to red and pewter, with black and orange as accents The \"Bucco Bruce\" logo was replaced by a red wind-swept flag displaying a white pirate skull and crossed sabres which is a modified Jolly Roger (similar to the one commonly associated with Calico Jack) The flagpole was another larger sabre The \"Buccaneers\" team name was written in a new font, Totally Gothic, and was either red with shadows of pewter or red and white Orange pinstriping, and an orange football, was used to maintain a visual link to the former colors [251] [234] Chris Berman nicknamed them \"the pirates in pewter pants,\" a play on the Gilbert and Sullivan opera The Pirates of Penzance The nickname \"Pewter Pirates\" also became trendy The Buccaneers staged a ceremony at The Pier on April 7, 1997, in which Bucco Bruce walked the plank of the pirate ship Bounty docked in Tampa Bay But not before he was pardoned at the last minute by Governor Lawton Chiles [230] [252]\n\n\n2014–2019\nThe Buccaneers unveiled a slightly altered logo and helmet on February 20, 2014 [255] [256] On March 3, 2014, they unveiled the entire new uniform to be used starting in the 2014 season The jersey numbers featured a high-vis reflective outline, the helmet logo was revamped and enlarged, and the facemask had a chrome-effect coating The Bucs' original Creamsicle shade of orange was reintroduced as accent trim [257] [258] [259] The reaction to the newer uniforms was mixed [260] Of note, the jersey numbers were derisively compared to digital alarm clock numerals [261] Different color sock combinations were used with white and colored uniforms, almost always being pewter or red; however, there were two occasions in 2014 when orange socks were used for two different weeks.\n\n\n2020–present\n\nThe Buccaneers unveiled three new jersey designs on April 7, 2020 The new uniform designs evoke the club's 1997–2013 design, while incorporating modern design elements from the 2014 uniform refresh, including the enlarged flag-and-crossed-swords logo, as well as the modern ship design logo on the sleeves While the Buccaneers kept the familiar red and white jerseys with either white or pewter pants, they changed their \"Color Rush\" alternate uniform to an all-pewter combination [263] [264] [265]\n\nThrowback uniform\nFollowing their uniform change in 1997, the Buccaneers did not wear the old orange uniforms, even during popular league-sponsored \"throwback\" weekends The old uniforms were mostly eschewed by the club, and the sale of team merchandise in the old color scheme was embargoed for several years Fans' opinions of the old uniforms were equally negative However, after over a decade, there was a renewed interest in the old uniforms, as throwbacks and other alternate uniforms across the league were becoming increasingly popular In 2008, the team revealed that they would be wearing orange throwback uniforms for one game in the 2009 season [267] Their use was in conjunction with the creation of a Buccaneers Ring of Honor, celebrating the 30th anniversary of the 1979 division championship team.\n\n\nSeasons, facts and records\nRunning backs (RB)\n\n\nRecords\nRunning backs (RB)\n\n\nPlayers of

with the creation of the NFC South and was described as \"heated\" and \"physical\" due to two main reasons; the first being that both teams fought for dominating control over the NFC South throughout most of the 2000s [300] [301] [302] [303] [304] [305] The second reason being that players on both franchises suffered season ending injuries during their annual games Examples include Chris Simms, Dante Wesley, Clifton Smith, and Kavika Pittman [299] [306] As of the 2023 season, the Panthers lead the rivalry 25–22 [307]\n\n\nNew Orleans Saints\nThe Saints and Buccaneers have one noticeable

their rivalry would truly begin to take off, [308] when both teams improved their fortunes, though the Buccaneers got over the hump first with by winning Super Bowl XXXVII and the Saints winning their first Super Bowl 7 years later in Super Bowl XLIV The first meeting between these two franchises first occurred in 1977 when the Buccaneers beat the Saints and ended their 26-game straight losing streak [309] While it is not the most well known rivalry in the NFL, it's grown into one of the league's fiercest and most physical The rivalry reached new heights in the 2000s, which was when the

The team is a member of the National Football League (NFL) and competes in the NFC South division.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Buccaneers joined the NFL as members of the AFC West in 1976. The following year, they were moved to the NFC Central, while the other 1976 expansion team, the Seattle Seahawks, switched conferences with Tampa Bay and joined the AFC West. This realignment was dictated by the league as part of the 1976 expansion plan, so that both teams could play each other twice and every other NFL franchise once during their first two seasons.\n\n**Hugh Culverhouse era (1976–1994)**\n\nThe Buccaneers joined the NFL as members of the AFC West in 1976. The following year, they were moved to the NFC Central, while the other 1976 expansion team, the Seattle Seahawks, switched conferences with Tampa Bay and joined the AFC West. This realignment was dictated by the league as part of the 1976 expansion plan, so that both teams could play each other twice and every other NFL franchise once during their first two seasons.\n\nThe Buccaneers played every conference team once, plus the Seahawks, instead of a traditional schedule of playing each division opponent twice. Despite the profitability of the Buccaneers in the 1980s, Culverhouse's death in 1994 revealed a man close to bankruptcy despite having a low payroll for his team.\n\n**John McKay years (1976–1984)**\n\nThe Buccaneers joined the NFL as members of the AFC West in 1976. The following year, they were moved to the NFC Central, while the other 1976 expansion team, the Seattle Seahawks, switched conferences with Tampa Bay and joined the AFC West. This realignment was dictated by the league as part of the 1976 expansion plan, so that both teams could play each other twice and every other NFL franchise once during their first two seasons.\n\nThe Buccaneers played every conference team once, plus the Seahawks, instead of a traditional schedule of playing each division opponent twice. John McKay was the head coach of the Buccaneers from 1976 to 1984 and was known for his innovative coaching style and his ability to adapt to the needs of his team.\n\n**Glazer family era (1995–present)**\n\nDespite the profitability of the Buccaneers in the 1980s, Culverhouse's death in 1994 revealed a man close to bankruptcy despite having a low payroll for his team. His son, Miami attorney Hugh Culverhouse Jr, soon sued his father's associates (Stephen Story, Jack Donlan, and Fred Cone) who had built the trust account that was meant to manage the elder Culverhouse's business (which involved a $350 million estate) after having his wife sign a post-nuptial agreement.\n\nA settlement was soon reached that gave control of the trust to Culverhouse Jr, who sold the team for $192 million. The Buccaneers were eventually purchased by the Glazer family, who have owned the team since 1995.\n\n**Tony Dungy years (1996–2001)**\n\nThe Buccaneers made a serious commitment to fielding a winning team, and the team's performance dramatically improved under the leadership of Tony Dungy, who was hired as the head coach in 1996. The team jettisoned the old uniform designs in favor of a modern look.\n\n**Jon Gruden years (2002–2008)**\n\nDungy was fired by the Buccaneers after a 31-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in the Wildcard Round of 2001, and soon thereafter hired as the head coach of the Indianapolis Colts. The Buccaneers mounted a search for his replacement that would include numerous names and rejections.\n\nSeveral potential candidates were offered the job, including University of Florida head coach (and former Buccaneers quarterback) Steve Spurrier, former New York Giants head coach Bill Parcells, and Baltimore Ravens defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis. Spurrier jumped to the Redskins when he was offered the most lucrative salary package ever offered to an NFL head coach, and Parcells eventually passed on the Buccaneers' offer.\n\nThe Bucs' general manager, Rich McKay, threw his support behind Lewis, but the Glazer brothers were so displeased with the selection of yet another defensive-minded coach that they overruled McKay and took control of the candidate search themselves. They made it clear that their top choice was Jon Gruden, who was still under contract with the Oakland Raiders.\n\n**Super Bowl XXXVII champions (2002)**\n\nThe 2002 season was the Buccaneers' most successful to date, with the team winning the NFC South title with a 12-4 record and scoring more points in two playoff wins over the 49ers and Eagles than in Buccaneers playoff history combined.\n\nThe Buccaneers' defense was instrumental in their 2002 playoff run, which led to their second Super Bowl title. The team's defense was led by linebacker Derrick Brooks, who was named the NFL Defensive Player of the Year.\n\n**Raheem Morris (2009)**\n\nThe 2009 squad started out 0-7, behind Leftwich and later Josh Johnson. Following their bye week, the team elevated Freeman to starting quarterback, resulting in the team's first win of the season. The team finished 3-13, the worst record since 1991.\n\n**Greg Schiano (2012-2013)**\n\nAbout three weeks after firing Raheem Morris, the Buccaneers hired Greg Schiano from Rutgers as the new head coach. During his introductory conference, he stated \"There will be Buccaneer men, and there will be a Buccaneer Way.\" The phrase \"The Buccaneer Way\" became a slogan among fans and local media, describing the new regime and attitude.\n\nThe team filled out the coaching staff with new faces, including Mike Sullivan, Bill Sheridan, and Butch Davis. In 2013, Dave Wannstedt was also added as special teams coach. In the first day of free agency, the club signed top prospects Vincent Jackson and Carl Nicks, as well as Eric Wright.\n\n**Lovie Smith (2014-2015)**\n\nOn January 1, 2014, Lovie Smith was hired as the new head coach of the Buccaneers, replacing Greg Schiano. Smith had previously spent 5 seasons with the Buccaneers from 1996 to 2001 coaching the linebackers under Tony Dungy. During his first news conference with the Bucs, Smith talked about restoring the quality of the team from the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\n**Dirk Koetter (2016-2018)**\n\nOn January 15, 2016, Dirk Koetter was promoted from offensive coordinator to become the new head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

The team made a significant investment in free agency, signing quarterback Tom Brady and several other key players.\n\n**Super Bowl LV champions (2020)**\n\nThe Buccaneers made arguably the biggest acquisition of the 2020 offseason when they acquired veteran quarterback Tom Brady, widely considered the greatest to ever play the position. The team made a deep playoff run, ultimately winning Super Bowl LV with a 31-9 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\n**Todd Bowles (2022-present)**\n\nOn March 30, 2022, head coach Bruce Arians suddenly resigned, with defensive coordinator Todd Bowles being named the immediate replacement. Bowles was a key member of the Buccaneers' staff during their Super Bowl LV championship season and has been a strong candidate to succeed Arians as head coach.\n\n**Defense**\n\nThroughout their history, the Buccaneers have been known for their suffocating defense. The team has led the league in total defense three times, including the 2002 championship season. Five Buccaneers players have been named the AP Defensive Player of the Year, including Derrick Brooks and Warren Sapp.\n\n**Facilities**\n\nThe Buccaneers have played their home games at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa since 1998. Prior to that, they had played in Tampa Stadium since their establishment.\n\n**Logos and uniforms**\n\nThe Buccaneers have undergone two distinct logo/uniform eras since their inception in 1976. The team's current logo is a modified Jolly Roger, which was introduced in 1997.

The team has also developed a minor instate rivalry with the Miami Dolphins.\n\n**Radio and television**\n\nThe Buccaneers' current flagship radio stations are WXTB 97.9 FM and WDAE 620 AM. The team's play-by-play announcer has been Gene Deckerhoff since 1989, with Dave Moore joining him as analyst in 2007.\n\n**Awards and honors**\n\nThe Buccaneers have been recognized for their achievements on and off the field, including winning Super Bowl XXXVII and Super Bowl LV. The team has also been recognized for their community service, including being named the NFL's Salute to Service Team of the Year in 2019.\n\nThe Buccaneers have also been recognized for their

NFL Defensive Player of the Year, but they eventually fell 10 points short of the Super Bowl as the offense held them back in the NFC Championship game in a 9–0 loss to the Los Angeles Rams Although

Bowles' 3–4 defense\nWhen Arians was hired by the Bucs, he appointed former New York Jets head coach Todd Bowles to be the team's defensive coordinator That same offseason, the team drafted linebacker Devin White with the fifth overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, after signing outside linebacker Shaquil Barrett to a one-year, $4 million contract, and defensive end Ndamukong Suh for one year,

Buccaneers defense was a massive part of the teams' turn-around in 2020, finishing 1st in run defense, 7th in pass defense and 8th in total defense The Buccaneers pass defense improved 29th to 7th, thanks in part to their young secondary, led by Carlton Davis, Sean Murphy-Bunting, Jordan Whitehead, Winfield Jr., Ross Cockrell, Herb Miller and Mike Edwards Nicknamed, the \"Grave Diggers\", they forced two interceptions, including a pick-six by Jamel Dean, four sacks and gave up no touchdowns against 2020 NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers in Week 6, forced three interceptions against future Hall of famer

\"Bucs\" became popular, but the alternative \"Bay Bucs\" failed to gain traction [226]\n\n\n1977–1991\nAfter only one season, the original orange numerals (with red outline) for the white \"away\" jerseys were reversed For 1977 and beyond, the white jerseys were revised to have red numerals with an orange outline The color swap provided better visibility, especially for television coverage purposes [236] The striped socks were dropped.\n\n\n1992–1996\nIn 1992, the Bucco Bruce logo was given a minor facelift, as part of an overall uniform refresh It resulted in a crisper and larger version, and was used for five seasons [242] The team introduced orange trousers to be worn with the white jerseys The white jerseys now had an orange collar, and would no longer be paired with white pants Most regular season home games during this period (except primetime games and selected late season games) saw white jerseys with orange pants The white on white combination would be used during preseason only.\n\n\n1997–2013\nA ballot measure to fund the construction of a new stadium passed in September 1996 As a result, the franchise was guaranteed to stay in Tampa, and the plans to design a new uniform were resurrected and reenergized [250] The Buccaneers worked with the NFL to develop a more marketable and intimidating look in order to improve the team's image Starting with the 1997 season, the primary team colors were changed to red and pewter, with black and orange as accents The \"Bucco Bruce\" logo was replaced by a red wind-swept flag displaying a white pirate skull and crossed sabres which is a modified Jolly Roger (similar to the one commonly associated with Calico Jack) The flagpole was another larger sabre The \"Buccaneers\" team name was written in a new font, Totally Gothic, and was either red with shadows of pewter or red and white Orange pinstriping, and an orange football, was used to maintain a visual link to the former colors [251] [234] Chris Berman nicknamed them \"the pirates in pewter pants,\" a play on the Gilbert and Sullivan opera The Pirates of Penzance The nickname \"Pewter Pirates\" also became trendy The Buccaneers staged a ceremony at The Pier on April 7, 1997, in which Bucco Bruce walked the plank of the pirate ship Bounty docked in Tampa Bay But not before he was pardoned at the last minute by Governor Lawton Chiles [230] [252]\n\n\n2014–2019\nThe Buccaneers unveiled a slightly altered logo and helmet on February 20, 2014 [255] [256] On March 3, 2014, they unveiled the entire new uniform to be used starting in the 2014 season The jersey numbers featured a high-vis reflective outline, the helmet logo was revamped and enlarged, and the facemask had a chrome-effect coating The Bucs' original Creamsicle shade of orange was reintroduced as accent trim [257] [258] [259] The reaction to the newer uniforms was mixed [260] Of note, the jersey numbers were derisively compared to digital alarm clock numerals [261] Different color sock combinations were used with white and colored uniforms, almost always being pewter or red; however, there were two occasions in 2014 when orange socks were used for two different weeks.\n\n\n2020–present\n\nThe Buccaneers unveiled three new jersey designs on April 7, 2020 The new uniform designs evoke the club's 1997–2013 design, while incorporating modern design elements from the 2014 uniform refresh, including the enlarged flag-and-crossed-swords logo, as well as the modern ship design logo on the sleeves While the Buccaneers kept the familiar red and white jerseys with either white or pewter pants, they changed their \"Color Rush\" alternate uniform to an all-pewter combination [263] [264] [265]\n\nThrowback uniform\nFollowing their uniform change in 1997, the Buccaneers did not wear the old orange uniforms, even during popular league-sponsored \"throwback\" weekends The old uniforms were mostly eschewed by the club, and the sale of team merchandise in the old color scheme was embargoed for several years Fans' opinions of the old uniforms were equally negative However, after over a decade, there was a renewed interest in the old uniforms, as throwbacks and other alternate uniforms across the league were becoming increasingly popular In 2008, the team revealed that they would be wearing orange throwback uniforms for one game in the 2009 season [267] Their use was in conjunction with the creation of a Buccaneers Ring of Honor, celebrating the 30th anniversary of the 1979 division championship team.\n\n\nSeasons, facts and records\nRunning backs

became fiercer after the 2002 season, when the Buccaneers and Falcons were placed in the same division, leading to constant clashes for the divisional title [293] [294] [295] [296] [297] The Buccaneers lead the overall series, 31–30 The two teams have not met in the playoffs [298]\n\n\nDivisional\nThe Buccaneers and Falcons met for the first time in the 1977 season, one year after the

playoffs [298]\n\n\nCarolina Panthers\nThe Buccaneers and Panthers first meet in 1995, back when the later team joined the NFL as expansion franchise [299] However, the rivalry would take off during the 2000s with the creation of the NFC South and was described as \"heated\" and \"physical\" due to two main reasons; the first being that both teams fought for dominating control over the NFC South throughout most of the 2000s [300] [301] [302] [303] [304] [305] The second reason being that players on both franchises suffered season ending injuries during their annual games Examples include Chris Simms, Dante Wesley, Clifton Smith, and Kavika Pittman [299] [306] As of the 2023 season, the Panthers lead the rivalry 25–22 [307]\n\n\nNew Orleans Saints\nThe Saints and Buccaneers have one noticeable parallel throughout the two franchises history, they were both regarded as unsuccessful franchises until the 21st century, which was both teams were placed in the NFC South in 2002, as well as when their rivalry would truly begin to take off, [308] when both teams improved their fortunes, though the Buccaneers got over the hump first with by winning Super Bowl XXXVII and the Saints winning their first Super Bowl 7 years later in Super Bowl XLIV The first meeting between these two franchises first occurred in 1977 when the Buccaneers beat the Saints and ended their 26-game straight losing streak [309] While it is not the most well known rivalry in the NFL, it's grown into one of the league's fiercest and most physical The rivalry reached new heights in the 2000s, which was when the Buccaneers had a higher advantage over the Saints in the regular season, when both teams started posting winning seasons in that decade [310] [308] [311] [312] New Orleans Saints leads the rivalry 39–24 and the two franchises meet once in the playoffs in which the Buccaneers defeated the Saints 30 to 20 and eventually won Super Bowl LV [313] [314]\n\n\nConference\nFrom 1977 to 2001; the Buccaneers played in the former NFC Central division, culminating in two former divisional rivalries developing with the Detroit Lions [315] [316] and the Green Bay Packers.\n\n\nGreen Bay Packers\nThe Buccaneers and Packers were division rivals from 1977 to 2002 when both were in the NFC Central division The teams have played several notable games, including a Snow Bowl game in 1985, a

grown a fairly recent playoff rivalry with the Philadelphia Eagles beginning in the late 1970s, but reached new heights in competition during the new millennium as the two teams have met in the postseason four times since 2000 [323] [324] [325] The rivalry would return in the early 2020s when the Buccaneers beat the Eagles in the 2021 and 2023 NFC Wild Card games [326] As of the 2023 season, The Buccaneers lead the all-time series 12–11 The Eagles lead in regular season matchups 8–9, while the Buccaneers leads 4–2 in the postseason [327]\n\n\nLos Angeles Rams\nThe Buccaneers have also grown a recent rivalry with the Los Angeles Rams as the two teams have faced off numerous times in the postseason; [328] [329] first meeting in the 2022 NFC Divisional round, [330] and in the Conference Championship twice, both in 1979 and 2000 [331] [332] with the Rams winning all 3 matchups The two teams became the first in league history to win a Super Bowl in their home stadiums as Tampa won Super Bowl LV in 2021, and Los Angeles won Super Bowl LVI a year later [333] Both teams combine for four Super Bowl championships as they regularly fought for control of the conference in the early 2000s and 2020s respectively [334] As of the 2023 season, the Rams lead the all-time series 19–10 [335]\n\n\nInter Conference\nThe Buccaneers developed a minor instate rivalry with fellow Floridian team; the Miami Dolphins The two teams had their first meeting in Week 7 of the 1976 season, with the Dolphins winning 23–20 [336] The 1976 meeting was the only one where both teams were

in December 2019 discussed the \"unidentified black male\" with Greg At Gregory's suggestion, Rash shared Gregory's cellphone with English, because Rash wanted Gregory to be \"an expert witness to be on the phone with 911\" to help identify Arbery; (3) Rash never deputized Gregory or gave him any authority; (4) Rash later shared security camera videos of Arbery with the McMichaels 12 days before

Arbery's murder, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp announced he would introduce legislation that would significantly amend the state's citizen's arrest law Georgia's citizen's arrest law had been textually very broad in scope, dating back to the Civil War era The legal defense argued by the defendants accused of murdering Arbery was that they were only attempting to perform a lawful citizen's arrest Kemp criticized the law for being outdated and vague According to Kemp, the changes would close numerous loopholes under the existing law while still protecting the rights of law-abiding citizens [250] On March 4, 2021, the proposed changes were passed out of legislative committee in the Georgia House of Representatives by a unanimous vote The bill, House Bill 479, received widespread and bipartisan support [251] The bill to repeal the citizen's arrest law passed the legislature and was signed by Governor Kemp on May 10, 2021 [252]\n\n\nAhmaud Arbery Day\nOn February 2, 2022, the Georgia General Assembly designated February 23 as Ahmaud Arbery Day within the state henceforth The Georgia General Assembly further encouraged people to run 2.23 miles on this day every year to advocate for racial justice and equity [254]\n\n\nHonorary Ahmaud Arbery Street\nOn August 9, 2022, officials of the city of Brunswick designated that all intersections along a 2.7-mile stretch of Albany Street bear a sign in his memory [255]\n\n\nInitial reactions\nArbery's mother Wanda Cooper-Jones said her son was jogging when he was murdered and called for arrests to be made [256] The Arbery family retained Benjamin Crump, S Lee Merritt, and Chris Stewart as attorneys [85] Meritt described the McMichaels as \"vigilantes\" and \"a posse\" who \"performed a modern lynching in the middle of the day.\" [257] Arbery's family attorney charged that videos of earlier police encounters show a pattern of unfair treatment of Arbery based on his skin color [258]\n\n\nInvolved parties and their families\nArbery's mother Wanda Cooper-Jones said her son was jogging when he was murdered and called for arrests to be made [256] The Arbery family retained Benjamin Crump, S Lee Merritt, and Chris Stewart as attorneys [85] Meritt described the McMichaels as \"vigilantes\" and \"a posse\" who \"performed a modern lynching in the middle of the day.\" [257] Arbery's family attorney charged that videos of earlier police encounters show a pattern of unfair treatment of Arbery based on his skin color [258]\n\n\nCurrent and former elected officials\nGeorgia Governor Brian Kemp condemned the actions of the murderers, saying Arbery \"was the victim of a vigilantism that has no place in Georgia.\" [279] Kemp and Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr each called for community, state, and national \"healing and reconciliation.\" [279] Activist and former Minority Leader of the Georgia House of Representatives Stacey Abrams said, \"A jury believed the evidence of their eyes and saw the meanness in the killers' hearts May this verdict bring a small measure of peace.\" [279] U.S Senator Raphael Warnock from Georgia said the verdict \"upholds a sense of accountability, but not true justice.\" [278] [279] Warnock's colleague Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff said, \"A historic civil rights mobilization was necessary for the killers to face prosecution at all.. [demonstrating] profoundly the urgency of reforms to make equal justice real in America.\" [278]\nPresident Joe Biden said Arbery's murder was \"a devastating reminder of how far we have to go in the fight for racial justice in this country.\" [278] [277] Vice President Kamala Harris said, \"We honor (Arbery) best by continuing the fight for justice.\" [278] Congressional Black Caucus chair Joyce Beatty said, \"This story – although devastating – is not new; we've seen this play out repeatedly...Justice has been served However, there is still much work to be done.\" [279]\n\n\nCivil rights groups, commentators, and the public\nAfter the video was released, demonstrators gathered outside the Glynn County Courthouse to demand an arrest in the case, and called for the resignation of District Attorney Jackie Johnson The local Brunswick NAACP chapter also called for the resignation of the Glynn County police chief [268] The Southern Poverty Law Center called for a federal investigation into the incident, citing their belief Arbery's murder was racially motivated [269] [270]\n\n\nReactions to the verdict\nCivil rights leaders and politicians reacted overwhelmingly to the verdict with hopeful yet cautionary statements, and Arbery's family thanked those who showed support [277] [278]\n\n\nCivil rights leaders\nArbery family lawyer and civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump said, \"Today certainly indicates progress, but we are nowhere close to the finish line Keep marching Keep fighting for what is right And never stop running for Ahmaud.\" [277] Crump added, \"While today is not one for celebration, it is one for reflection.\" [278] Derrick Johnson, President and CEO of the NAACP, called the verdict \"long overdue.\" [278]\n\n\nFamily\nArbery's mother Wanda Cooper-Jones has said, \"It's been a long fight, it's been a hard fight...Thank you to those who marched, the ones who prayed, thank you.\" [277] Arbery's father Marcus Arbery commented, \"We conquered that lynch mob.\" [277]\n\n\nCurrent and former elected officials\nGeorgia Governor Brian Kemp condemned the actions of the murderers, saying Arbery \"was the victim of a vigilantism that has no place in Georgia.\" [279] Kemp and Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr each called for community, state, and national \"healing and reconciliation.\" [279] Activist and former Minority Leader of the Georgia House of Representatives Stacey Abrams said, \"A jury believed the evidence of their eyes and saw the meanness in the killers' hearts May this verdict bring a small measure of peace.\" [279] U.S Senator Raphael Warnock from Georgia said the verdict \"upholds a sense of accountability, but not true justice.\" [278] [279] Warnock's colleague Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff said, \"A historic civil rights mobilization was necessary for the killers to face prosecution at all..

regularly referenced [6] [31] [32] [33] He wrote papers and articles that appeared in various journals and magazines on retail, management and quaker subjects [34] [35] [36]\n\n\nSelected Bibliography\nMcClelland served on many national and local government advisory bodies, as well as those of independent institutions,  including:\n\n\nPublic service\nMcClelland served on many national and local government advisory bodies, as well as those of independent institutions,  including:\n\n\nVoluntary work\nMcClelland, along with his first wife Diana were active members of the Society of Friends, at both local and national level, with him serving as an Elder between 1958 and 1962 [1] [48] Prior to World War II, McClelland had argued in a school speaking competition entitled When we have won the war that Germany should not be punished with another Versailles style treatment [49] He would later go on Quaker and International Fellowship of Reconciliation organised delegation trips, first to the USSR in 1952 and then China in 1952 and 1955, followed by the US in 1957, afterwards having to overcome smears of being a communist sympathiser [1] [50] [51] In his eighties, McClelland promoted to the Newcastle Local Friends meeting a new project The Newcastle Conflict Resolution Network idea was adopted and receives funding from the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust [49]\n\n\nAwards and recognition\nMcClelland was made a Companion at the British Institute of Management, the most senior grade of membership which was awarded by invitation only [4] In 1985, McClelland was honoured by Durham University when he was given an Honorary Doctorate in Law [4] In the Queen's Birthday Honours for 1994, McClelland was given a CBE for his charitable services in Tyne & Wear [57] It was reported he had previously turned down an award while Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister [1] In 2003, he returned the CBE as part of his protest to the war in Iraq, but was given a receipt saying he could have it back when and if he wanted it, which he duly did in 2009 [56] [6]\n\n\nPersonal life\nMcClelland met his first wife, Diana Avery Close, while they were volunteering as an aid worker in

{"title": "Buenos_Aires", "content": "\nEtymology\nAragonese archives record that Catalan missionaries and Jesuits arriving in Cagliari (Sardinia) under the Crown of Aragon, after its capture from the Pisans in 1324, established their headquarters on top of a hill that overlooked the city [24] The hill was known to them as Bonaira (or Bonaria in Sardinian), as it was free of the foul smell prevalent in the old city (the castle area), which is adjacent to swampland During the siege of Cagliari, the Catalans built a sanctuary to the Virgin Mary on top of the hill In 1335, King Alfonso the Gentle donated the church to the Mercedarians, who built an abbey that stands to this day In the years after that, a story circulated, claiming that a statue of the Virgin Mary was retrieved from the sea after it miraculously calmed a storm in the Mediterranean Sea The statue was placed in the abbey Spanish sailors, especially Andalusians, venerated this image and frequently invoked the \"Fair Winds\" to aid them in their navigation and prevent shipwrecks A sanctuary to the Virgin of Buen Ayre would later be erected in Seville [24]\n\n\nHistory\n Kingdom of Spain - Habsburg, 1536–1700 \n Kingdom of Spain - Bourbon, 1700–1808 \n Kingdom of Spain - Bonaparte, 1808–1810 \n United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, 1810–1831 \n Argentine Confederation, 1831–1852 \n State of Buenos Aires, 1852–1861 \n Argentina, 1861–present\n\n\nViceregal times\nIn 1516, navigator and explorer Juan Díaz de Solís, navigating in the name of Spain, was the first European to reach the Río de la Plata His expedition was cut short when he was killed during an attack by the native Charrúa tribe in what is now Uruguay The city of Buenos Aires was first established as Ciudad de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre [3] (literally \"City of Our Lady Saint Mary of the Fair Winds\") after Our Lady of Bonaria (Patroness Saint of Sardinia) on 2 February 1536 by a Spanish expedition led by Pedro de Mendoza The settlement founded by Mendoza was located in what is today the San Telmo district of Buenos Aires, south of the city center.\n\n\nWar of Independence\nDuring the British invasions of the Río de la Plata, British forces attacked Buenos Aires twice In 1806 the British successfully invaded Buenos Aires, but an army from Montevideo led by Santiago de Liniers defeated them In the brief period of British rule, the viceroy Rafael Sobremonte managed to escape to Córdoba and designated this city as capital Buenos Aires became the capital again after its recapture by Argentine forces, but Sobremonte could not resume his duties as viceroy Santiago de Liniers, chosen as new viceroy, prepared the city against a possible new British attack and repelled a second invasion by Britain in 1807 The militarization generated in society changed the balance of power favorably for the criollos (in contrast to peninsulars), as well as the development of the Peninsular War in Spain.\n\n\n19th and 20th century\nDuring most of the 19th century, the political status of the city remained a sensitive subject It was already the capital of Buenos Aires Province, and between 1853 and 1860 it was the capital of the seceded State of Buenos Aires The issue was fought out more than once on the battlefield, until the matter was finally settled in 1880 when the city was federalized and became the seat of government, with its mayor appointed by the president The Casa Rosada became the seat of the president [29]\n\n\n21st century\nIn 1996, following the 1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution, the city held its first mayoral elections under the new statutes, with the mayor's title formally changed to \"Head of Government\" The winner was Fernando de la Rúa, who would later become President of Argentina from 1999 to 2001.\n\n\nGeography\nThe city of Buenos Aires lies in the pampa region, with the exception of some areas such as the Buenos Aires Ecological Reserve, the Boca Juniors (football club)'s \"sports city\", Jorge Newbery Airport, the Puerto Madero neighborhood and the main port itself; these were all built on reclaimed land along the coasts of the Rio de la Plata (the world's widest river) [44] [45] [46]\n\n\nParks\nBuenos Aires has over 250 parks and green spaces, the largest concentration of which are on the city's eastern side in the neighborhoods of Puerto Madero, Recoleta, Palermo, and Belgrano Some of the most important are:\n\n\nClimate\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, Buenos Aires has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) [47] [48] As a result of maritime influences from the adjoining Atlantic Ocean, [49] the climate is temperate with extreme temperatures being rare [50] Because the city is located in an area where the Pampero and Sudestada winds pass by, [51] the weather is variable due to these contrasting air masses [52]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nSince the adoption of the city's Constitution in 1996, Buenos Aires has counted with a democratically elected executive; Article 61 of the Constitution of the states that \"Suffrage is free, equal, secret, universal, compulsory and non-accumulative Resident aliens enjoy this same right, with its corresponding obligations, on equal terms with Argentine citizens registered in the district, under the terms established by law.\" [71] The executive power is vested on the Chief of Government (Spanish: Jefe de Gobierno), who is elected alongside a Deputy Chief of Government In analogous fashion to the Vice President of Argentina, the Deputy Chief of Government presides over the city's legislative body, the City Legislature.\n\n\nGovernment structure\nSince the adoption of the city's Constitution in 1996, Buenos Aires has counted with a democratically elected executive; Article 61 of the Constitution of the states that \"Suffrage is free, equal, secret, universal, compulsory and non-accumulative Resident aliens enjoy this same right, with its corresponding obligations, on equal terms with Argentine citizens registered in the district, under the terms established by law.\" [71] The executive power is vested on the Chief of Government (Spanish: Jefe de Gobierno), who is elected alongside a Deputy Chief of Government In analogous fashion to the Vice President of Argentina, the Deputy Chief of Government presides over the city's legislative body, the City Legislature.\n\n\nLaw enforcement\nThe Guardia Urbana de Buenos Aires (Buenos Aires Urban Guard) was a specialized civilian force of the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina, that used to deal with different urban conflicts with the objective of developing actions of prevention, dissuasion and mediation, promoting effective behaviors that guarantee the security and the integrity of public order and social coexistence The unit continuously assisted the personnel of the Argentine Federal Police, especially in emergency situations, events of massive concurrence, and protection of tourist establishments Urban Guard officials did not carry any weapons in the performing of their duties Their basic tools were a HT radio transmitter and a whistle As of March 2008 [update], the Guardia Urbana was removed.\n\n\nDemographics\nIn the census of 2010, there were 2,891,082 people residing in the city [77] The population of Greater Buenos Aires was 13,147,638 according to 2010 census data [78] The population density in Buenos Aires proper was 13,680 inhabitants per square kilometer (35,400 inhabitants/sq mi), but only about 2,400/km2 (6,200/sq mi) in the suburbs [79]\n\n\nCensus data\nIn the census of 2010, there were 2,891,082 people residing in the city [77] The population of Greater Buenos Aires was 13,147,638 according to 2010 census data [78] The population density in Buenos Aires proper was 13,680 inhabitants per square kilometer (35,400 inhabitants/sq mi), but only about 2,400/km2 (6,200/sq mi) in the suburbs [79]\n\n\nDistricts\nThe city is divided into barrios (neighborhoods) for administrative purposes, a division originally based on Catholic parroquias (parishes) [84] A common expression is that of the Cien barrios porteños (\"One hundred porteño neighborhoods\"), referring to a composition made popular in the 1940s by tango singer Alberto Castillo; however, Buenos Aires only consists of 48 official barrios There are several subdivisions of these districts, some with a long history and others that are the product of a real estate invention A notable example is Palermo – the city's largest district – which has been subdivided into various barrios, including Palermo Soho, Palermo Hollywood, Las Cañitas and Palermo viejo, among others A newer scheme has divided the city into 15 comunas (communes) [85]\n\n\nPopulation origin\nThe majority of porteños have European origins, mostly from the Andalusian, Galician, Asturian, and Basque regions of Spain, as well as the Italian regions of Calabria, Liguria, Piedmont, Lombardy, Sicily and Campania [86] [87] Unrestricted waves of European immigrants to Argentina starting in the mid-19th century significantly increased the country's population, even causing the number of porteños to triple between 1887 and 1915 from 500,000 to 1.5 million [88]\n\n\nUrban problems\nVillas miseria are a type of slum whose size ranges from small groups of precarious houses to large communities with thousands of residents [98] In rural areas, the houses in the villas miseria might be made of mud and wood Villas miseria are found around and inside the large cities of Buenos Aires, Rosario, Córdoba and Mendoza, among others.\n\n\nLanguage\nBuenos Aires' dialect of Spanish, which is known as Rioplatense Spanish, is distinguished by its use of voseo, yeísmo, and aspiration of s in various contexts It is heavily influenced by the dialects of Spanish spoken in Andalusia and Murcia and shares its features with that of other cities like Rosario and Montevideo, Uruguay In the early 20th century, Argentina absorbed millions of immigrants, many of them Italians, who spoke mostly in their local dialects (mainly Neapolitan, Sicilian and Genoese) Their adoption of Spanish was gradual, creating a pidgin of Italian dialects and Spanish that was called cocoliche Its usage declined around the 1950s A phonetic study conducted by the Laboratory for Sensory Investigations of CONICET and the University of Toronto showed that the prosody of porteño is closer to the Neapolitan language of Italy than to any other spoken language [101] Many Spanish immigrants were from Galicia, and Spaniards are still generically referred to in Argentina as gallegos (Galicians) Galician language, cuisine and culture had a major presence in the city for most of the 20th century In recent years, descendants of Galician immigrants have led a small boom in Celtic music (which also highlighted the Welsh traditions of Patagonia) Yiddish was commonly heard in Buenos Aires, especially in the Balvanera garment district and in Villa Crespo until the 1960s Most of the newer immigrants learn Spanish quickly and assimilate into city life.\n\n\nReligion\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, Buenos Aires was the second-largest Catholic city in the world after Paris [104] [105] Christianity is still the most prevalently practiced religion in Buenos Aires (~71.4%), [106] a 2019 CONICET survey on religious beliefs and attitudes found that the inhabitants of the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area (Área Metropolitana de Buenos Aires, AMBA) were 56.4% Catholic, 26.2% non-religious and 15% Evangelical; making it the region of the country with the highest proportion of irreligious people [106] A previous CONICET survey from 2008 had found that 69.1% were Catholic, 18% \"indifferent\", 9.1% Evangelical, 1.4% Jehovah's Witnesses or Mormons and 2.3% adherents to other religions [107] The comparison between both surveys reveals that the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area is the region in which the decline of Catholicism was most pronounced during the last decade [106]\n\n\nEducation\nPrimary education comprises grades 1–7 Most primary schools in the city still adhere to the traditional seven-year primary school, but kids can do grades 1–6 if their high school lasts 6 years, such as ORT Argentina Secondary education in Argentina is called Polimodal (having multiple modes) since it allows the student to choose their orientation Polimodal is usually 3 years of schooling, although some schools have a fourth year Before entering the first year of polimodal, students choose an orientation from the following five specializations Some high schools depend on the University of Buenos Aires, and these require an admission course when students are taking the last year of high school These high schools are ILSE, CNBA, Escuela Superior de Comercio Carlos Pellegrini and Escuela de Educación Técnica Profesional en Producción Agropecuaria y Agroalimentaria (School of Professional Technique Education in Agricultural and Agrifood Production) The last two do have a specific orientation In December 2006 the Chamber of Deputies of the Argentine Congress passed a new National Education Law restoring the old system of primary followed by secondary education, making secondary education obligatory and a right, and increasing the length of compulsory education to 13 years The government vowed to put the law in effect gradually, starting in 2007 [112]\n\n\nEconomy\nBuenos Aires is the financial, industrial, and commercial hub of Argentina The economy in the city proper alone, measured by gross geographic product (adjusted for purchasing power), totaled US$102.7 billion (US$34,200 per capita) in 2020 [118] and amounts to nearly a quarter of Argentina's as a whole [119] Metro Buenos Aires, according to one well-quoted study, constitutes the 13th largest economy among the world's cities in 2005 [120] The Buenos Aires Human Development Index (0.889 in 2019) is likewise high by international standards [121]\n\n\nTourism\nAccording to the World Travel & Tourism Council, [126] tourism has been growing in the Argentine capital since 2002 In a survey by the travel and tourism publication Travel + Leisure Magazine in 2008, visitors voted Buenos Aires the second most desirable city to visit after Florence, Italy [127] In 2008, an estimated 2.5 million visitors visited the city [128] Buenos Aires is an international hub of highly active and diverse nightlife with bars, dance bars and nightclubs staying open well past midnight [129] [130] [131]\n\n\nTransportation\nAccording to data released by Moovit in July 2017, the average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Buenos Aires, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 79 min 23% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 min, while 20 percent of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 8.9 km (5.5 mi), while 21% travel for over 12 km (7.5 mi) [136]\n\n\nRoads\nBuenos Aires is based on a rectangular grid pattern, save for natural barriers or the relatively rare developments explicitly designed otherwise (most notably, the Parque Chas neighborhood) The rectangular grid provides for 110-meter (361 ft)-long square blocks named manzanas Pedestrian zones in the central business district such as Florida Street are partially car-free and always bustling, access provided by bus and the Underground (subte) Line C Buenos Aires, for the most part, is a very walkable city and the majority of residents in Buenos Aires use public transport.\n\n\nAirports\nThe Ministro Pistarini International Airport, commonly known as Ezeiza Airport, is located in the suburb of Ezeiza, in Buenos Aires Province, approximately 22 km (14 mi) south of the city This airport handles most international air traffic to and from Argentina as well as some domestic flights.\n\n\nUrban rail\nThe Buenos Aires Underground (locally known as subte, from \"subterráneo\" meaning underground or subway), is a high-yield [clarification needed] system providing access to various parts of the city Opened in 1913, it is the oldest underground system in the Southern Hemisphere and oldest in the Spanish-speaking world The system has six underground lines and one overground line, named by letters (A to E, and H) and there are 107 stations, and 58.8 km (37 mi) of route, including the Premetro line [141] An expansion program is underway to extend existing lines into the outer neighborhoods and add a new north–south line Route length is expected to reach 89 km (55 mi) by 2011.\n\n\nCycling\nIn December 2010, the city government launched a bicycle sharing program with bicycles free for hire by users upon registration Located in mostly central areas, there are 31 rental stations throughout the city providing over 850 bicycles to be picked up and dropped off at any station within an hour [163] As of 2013 [update], the city has constructed 110 km (68.35 mi) of protected bicycle lanes and has plans to construct another 100 km (62.14 mi) [164] In 2015, the stations were automated and the service became 24 hours through use of a smart card or mobile phone application.\n\n\nBuses\nThere are over 150 city bus lines called Colectivos, each one managed by an individual company These compete with each other and attract exceptionally high use with virtually no public financial support [165] Their frequency makes them equal to the underground systems of other cities, but buses cover a far wider area than the underground system Colectivos in Buenos Aires do not have a fixed timetable, but run from four to several per hour, depending on the bus line and time of the day With inexpensive tickets and extensive routes, usually no further than four blocks from commuters' residences, the colectivo is the most popular mode of transport around the city [165]\n\n\nPort\nThe port of Buenos Aires is one of the busiest in South America, as navigable rivers by way of the Rio de la Plata connect the port to northeastern Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay As a result, it serves as the distribution hub for said vast area of the South American continent The Port of Buenos Aires handles over 11,000,000 metric tons (11,000,000 long tons; 12,000,000 short tons) annually, [168] and Dock Sud, just south of the city proper, handles another 17,000,000 metric tons (17,000,000 long tons; 19,000,000 short tons) [169] Tax collection related to the port has caused many political problems in the past, including a conflict in 2008 that led to protests and a strike in the agricultural sector after the government raised export tariffs [170]\n\n\nFerries\nBuenos Aires is also served by a ferry system operated by the company Buquebus that connects the port of Buenos Aires with the main cities of Uruguay, (Colonia del Sacramento, Montevideo and Punta del Este) More than 2.2 million people per year travel between Argentina and Uruguay with Buquebus One of these ships is a catamaran, which can reach a top speed of about 80 km/h (50 mph) [171]\n\n\nTaxis\nA fleet of 40,000 black-and-yellow taxis ply the streets at all hours Some taxi drivers may try to take advantage of tourists., [172] but radio-link companies provide reliable and safe service; many such companies provide incentives for frequent users Low-fare limo services, known as remises, are also popular [173] [174] though currently giving way to ridesharing companies like Uber or Cabify, whose legal status has been the cause of much dispute with the city government [175]\n\n\nCulture\nAs Buenos Aires is strongly influenced by European culture, the city is sometimes referred to as the \"Paris of South America\" [3] [176] With its scores of theaters and productions, the city has the busiest live theater industry in South America [177] In fact, every weekend, there are about 300 active theaters with plays, a number that places the city as 1st worldwide, more than either London, New York or Paris, cultural Meccas in themselves The number of cultural festivals with more than 10 sites and five years of existence also places the city as 2nd worldwide, after Edinburgh [178] The Centro Cultural Kirchner (Kirchner Cultural Center), located in Buenos Aires, is the largest cultural center of Latin America, [179] [180] and the third worldwide [181]\n\n\nArt\nBuenos Aires has a thriving arts culture, [184] with \"a huge inventory of museums, ranging from obscure to world-class.\" [185] The barrios of Palermo and Recoleta are the city's traditional bastions in the diffusion of art, although in recent years there has been a tendency of appearance of exhibition venues in other districts such as Puerto Madero or La Boca; renowned venues include MALBA, the National Museum of Fine Arts, Fundación Proa, Faena Arts Center, and the Usina del Arte [186] Other popular institutions are the Buenos Aires Museum of Modern Art, the Benito Quinquela Martín Museum, the Evita Museum, the Museo de Arte Hispanoamericano Isaac Fernández Blanco, the José Hernández Museum, and the Palais de Glace, among others [187] A traditional event that occurs once a year is La Noche de los Museos (\"Night of the Museums\"), when the city's museums, universities, and artistic spaces open their doors for free until early morning; it usually takes place in November [188] [189]\n\n\nLiterature\nBuenos Aires has long been considered an intellectual and literary capital of Latin America and the Spanish-speaking world [197] [198] Despite its short urban history, Buenos Aires has an abundant literary production; its mythical-literary network \"has grown at the same rate at which the streets of the city earned its shores to the pampas and buildings stretched its shadow on the curb.\" [199] During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, culture boomed along with the economy and the city emerged as a literary capital and the seat of South America's most powerful publishing industry, [200] and \"even if the economic path grew rocky, ordinary Argentines embraced and stuck to the habit of reading.\" [201] By the 1930s, Buenos Aires was the undisputed literary capital of the Spanish-speaking world, with Victoria Ocampo founding the highly influential Sur magazine—which dominated Spanish-language literature for thirty years— [202] and the arrival of prominent Spanish writers and editors who were escaping the civil war [201]\n\n\nMusic\nAccording to the Harvard Dictionary of Music, \"Argentina has one of the richest art music traditions and perhaps the most active contemporary musical life\" in South America [207] Buenos Aires boasts of several professional orchestras, including the Argentine National Symphony Orchestra, the Ensamble Musical de Buenos Aires and the Camerata Bariloche; as well as various conservatories that offer professional music education, like the Conservatorio Nacional Superior de Música [207] As a result of the growth and commercial prosperity of the city in the late 18th century, theater became a vital force in Argentine musical life, offering Italian and French operas and Spanish zarzuelas [207] Italian music was very influential during the 19th century and the early 20th century, in part because of immigration, but operas and salon music were also composed by Argentines, including Francisco Hargreaves and Juan Gutiérrez [207] A nationalist trend that drew from Argentine traditions, literature and folk music was an important force during the 19th century, including composers Alberto Williams, Julián Aguirre, Arturo Berutti and Felipe Boero [207] In the 1930s, composers such as Juan Carlos Paz and Alberto Ginastera \"began to espouse a cosmopolitan and modernist style, influenced by twelve-tone techniques and serialism\"; while avant-garde music thrived by the 1960s, with the Rockefeller Foundation financing the Centro Interamericano de Altos Estudios Musicales, which brought internationally famous composers to work and teach in Buenos Aires, also establishing an electronic music studio [207]\n\n\nCinema\nArgentine cinema history began in Buenos Aires with the first film exhibition on 18 July 1896 at the Teatro Odeón [211] [212] With his 1897 film, La bandera Argentina, Eugène Py became one of the first filmmakers of the country; the film features a waving Argentine flag located at Plaza de Mayo [212] In the early 20th century, the first movie theaters of the country opened in Buenos Aires, and newsreels appeared, most notably El Viaje de Campos Salles a Buenos Aires [212] The real industry emerged with the advent of sound films, the first one being Muñequitas porteñas (1931) [211] [212] The newly founded Argentina Sono Film released ¡Tango! in 1933, the first integral sound production in the country [212] During the 1930s and the 1940s (commonly referred as the \"Golden Age\" of Argentine cinema), many films revolved around the city of Buenos Aires and tango culture, reflected in titles such as La vida es un tango, El alma del bandoneón, Adiós Buenos Aires, El Cantor de Buenos Aires and Buenos Aires canta Argentine films were exported across Latin America, specially Libertad Lamarque's melodramas, and the comedies of Luis Sandrini and Niní Marshall The popularity of local cinema in the Spanish-speaking world played a key role in the massification of tango music Carlos Gardel, an iconic figure of tango and Buenos Aires, became an international star by starring in several films during that era.\n\n\nMedia\nBuenos Aires is home to five Argentine television networks: America, Television Pública Argentina, El Nueve, Telefe, and El Trece Four of them are located in Buenos Aires, and the studios of America is located in La Plata.\n\n\nFashion\nBuenos Aires' inhabitants have been historically characterized as \"fashion-conscious\" [216] [217] [218] National designers display their collections annually at the Buenos Aires Fashion Week (BAFWEEK) and related events [219] Inevitably being a season behind, it fails to receive much international attention [220] Nevertheless, the city remains an important regional fashion capital According to Global Language Monitor, as of 2017 [update] the city is the 20th leading fashion capital in the world, ranking second in Latin America after Rio de Janeiro [221] In 2005, Buenos Aires was appointed as the first UNESCO City of Design, [222] and received this title once again in 2007 [223] Since 2015, the Buenos Aires International Fashion Film Festival Buenos Aires (BAIFFF) takes place, sponsored by the city and Mercedes-Benz [224] The government of the city also organizes La Ciudad de Moda (\"The City of Fashion\"), an annual event that serves as a platform for emerging creators and attempts to boost the sector by providing management tools [225]\n\n\nArchitecture\nBuenos Aires architecture is characterized by its eclectic nature, with elements resembling Paris and Madrid There is a mix, due to immigration, of Colonial, Art Deco, Art Nouveau, Neo-Gothic, and French Bourbon styles [228] Italian and French influences increased after the declaration of independence at the beginning of the 19th century, although the academic style persisted until the first decades of the 20th century Attempts at renovation took place during the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, when European influences penetrated into the country, reflected by several buildings of Buenos Aires such as the Iglesia Santa Felicitas by Ernesto Bunge; the Palace of Justice, the National Congress, all of them by Vittorio Meano, and the Teatro Colón, by Francesco Tamburini and Vittorio Meano The simplicity of the Rioplatense baroque style is evident in Buenos Aires through the works of Italian architects such as André Blanqui and Antonio Masella, in the churches of San Ignacio, Nuestra Señora del Pilar, the Cathedral and the Cabildo.\n\n\nTheaters\nBuenos Aires has over 280 theaters, more than any other city in the world [232] Because of this, Buenos Aires is declared the \"World's Capital of Theater\" [233] They show everything from musicals to ballet, comedy to circuses [234] Some of them are:\n\n\nSports\nBuenos Aires has been a candidate city for the Summer Olympic Games on three occasions: for the 1956 Games, which were lost by a single vote to Melbourne; for the 1968 Summer Olympics, held in Mexico City; and in 2004, when the games were awarded to Athens However, Buenos Aires hosted the first Pan American Games (1951) [182] and was also host city to several World Championship events: the 1950 and 1990 Basketball World Championships, the 1982 and 2002 Men's Volleyball World Championships and, most

The city is situated on the Rio de la Plata, a major river in South America, and is known for its European-style architecture, cosmopolitan atmosphere, and world-class museums.\n\nEtymology\n----------\n\nThe name \"Buenos Aires\" is derived from the Spanish phrase \"Buen Ayre,\" which means \"Fair Winds.\" The city was founded by Spanish settlers in 1536, and the name was chosen to commemorate the calm and peaceful weather experienced by the early settlers.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\nThe history of Buenos Aires is marked by periods of Spanish colonial rule, independence, and immigration. The city was first established as a Spanish settlement in 1536, and it quickly grew into a major hub of trade and commerce. During the 17th and 18th centuries, Buenos Aires was a key center of the Spanish Empire, and it played an important role in the wars of independence against Spain.\n\nIn 1806, the British invaded Buenos Aires, but the city was recaptured by Spanish forces in 1807. The war of independence against Spain was finally won in 1816, and Buenos Aires became the capital of the newly independent Republic of Argentina.\n\nDuring the 19th century, Buenos Aires experienced rapid growth and development, driven by immigration from Europe, particularly from Italy and Spain. The city became a major cultural and economic center, and it was known for its vibrant arts scene, world-class museums, and cosmopolitan atmosphere.\n\nIn the 20th century, Buenos Aires continued to grow and develop, and it became a major hub of trade and commerce. The city was also a center of politics and culture, and it played an important role in the country's history.\n\nViceregal Times\n---------------\n\nIn 1516, navigator and explorer Juan Díaz de Solís, navigating in the name of Spain, was the first European to reach the Río de la Plata. His expedition was cut short when he was killed during an attack by the native Charrúa tribe in what is now Uruguay.\n\nThe city of Buenos Aires was first established as Ciudad de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre in 1536 by a Spanish expedition led by Pedro de Mendoza. The settlement founded by Mendoza was located in what is today the San Telmo district of Buenos Aires, south of the city center.\n\nWar of Independence\n-------------------\n\nDuring the British invasions of the Río de la Plata, British forces attacked Buenos Aires twice. In 1806 the British successfully invaded Buenos Aires, but an army from Montevideo led by Santiago de Liniers defeated them. In the brief period of British rule, the viceroy Rafael Sobremonte managed to escape to Córdoba and designated this city as capital.\n\nBuenos Aires became the capital again after its recapture by Argentine forces, but Sobremonte could not resume his duties as viceroy. Santiago de Liniers, chosen as new viceroy, prepared the city against a possible new British attack and repelled a second invasion by Britain in 1807.\n\n19th and 20th Century\n--------------------\n\nDuring most of the 19th century, the political status of the city remained a sensitive subject. It was already the capital of Buenos Aires Province, and between 1853 and 1860 it was the capital of the seceded State of Buenos Aires.\n\nThe issue was fought out more than once on the battlefield, until the matter was finally settled in 1880 when the city was federalized and became the seat of government, with its mayor appointed by the president.\n\n21st Century\n------------\n\nIn 1996, following the 1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution, the city held its first mayoral elections under the new statutes, with the mayor's title formally changed to \"Head of Government.\" The winner was Fernando de la Rúa, who would later become President of Argentina from 1999 to 2001.\n\nGeography\n----------\n\nThe city of Buenos Aires lies in the pampa region, with the exception of some areas such as the Buenos Aires Ecological Reserve, the Boca Juniors (football club)'s \"sports city,\" Jorge Newbery Airport, the Puerto Madero neighborhood and the main port itself.\n\nThese areas were all built on reclaimed land along the coasts of the Rio de la Plata, the world's widest river.\n\nParks\n-----\n\nBuenos Aires has over 250 parks and green spaces, the largest concentration of which are on the city's eastern side in the neighborhoods of Puerto Madero, Recoleta, Palermo, and Belgrano.\n\nSome of the most important parks in the city include:\n\n*   Parque Tres de Febrero\n*   Parque Centenario\n*   Parque Lezama\n*   Parque Patricios\n*   Parque Chacabuco\n\nClimate\n--------\n\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, Buenos Aires has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa).\n\nAs a result of maritime influences from the adjoining Atlantic Ocean, the climate is temperate with extreme temperatures being rare.\n\nBecause the city is located in an area where the Pampero and Sudestada winds pass by, the weather is variable due to these contrasting air masses.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n----------------------\n\nSince the adoption of the city's Constitution in 1996, Buenos Aires has counted with a democratically elected executive; Article 61 of the Constitution of the states that \"Suffrage is free, equal, secret, universal, compulsory and non-accumulative.\n\nResident aliens enjoy this same right, with its corresponding obligations, on equal terms with Argentine citizens registered in the district, under the terms established by law.\"\n\nThe executive power is vested on the Chief of Government (Spanish: Jefe de Gobierno), who is elected alongside a Deputy Chief of Government.\n\nLanguage\n---------\n\nBuenos Aires' dialect of Spanish, which is known as Rioplatense Spanish, is distinguished by its use of voseo, yeísmo, and aspiration of s in various contexts.\n\nIt is heavily influenced by the dialects of Spanish spoken in Andalusia and Murcia and shares its features with that of other cities like Rosario and Montevideo, Uruguay.\n\nUrban Problems\n--------------\n\nVillas miseria are a type of slum whose size ranges from small groups of precarious houses to large communities with thousands of residents.\n\nIn rural areas, the houses in the villas miseria might be made of mud and wood. Villas miseria are found around and inside the large cities of Buenos Aires, Rosario, Córdoba and Mendoza, among others.\n\nEducation\n---------\n\nPrimary education comprises grades 1–7.\n\nMost primary schools in the city still adhere to the traditional seven-year primary school, but kids can do grades 1–6 if their high school lasts 6 years, such as ORT Argentina.\n\nSecondary education in Argentina is called Polimodal (having multiple modes) since it allows the student to choose their orientation.\n\nEducation in Buenos Aires is free and compulsory for all children between the ages of 5 and 18.\n\nEconomy\n--------\n\nBuenos Aires is the financial, industrial, and commercial hub of Argentina.\n\nThe economy in the city proper alone, measured by gross geographic product (adjusted for purchasing power), totaled US$102.7 billion (US$34,200 per capita) in 2020 and amounts to nearly a quarter of Argentina's as a whole.\n\nTourism\n--------\n\nAccording to the World Travel & Tourism Council, tourism has been growing in the Argentine capital since 2002.\n\nIn a survey by the travel and tourism publication Travel + Leisure Magazine in 2008, visitors voted Buenos Aires the second most desirable city to visit after Florence, Italy.\n\nIn 2008, an estimated 2.5 million visitors visited the city.\n\nBuenos Aires is an international hub of highly active and diverse nightlife with bars, dance bars and nightclubs staying open well past midnight.\n\nTransportation\n-------------\n\nBuenos Aires has an extensive public transportation system, including buses, colectivos, and the underground.\n\nAccording to data released by Moovit in July 2017, the average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Buenos Aires, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 79 minutes.\n\n21% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day.\n\nThe average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 minutes, while 20 percent of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day.\n\nThe average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 8.9 kilometers (5.5 miles), while 21% travel for over 12 kilometers (7.5 miles).\n\nRoads\n-----\n\nBuenos Aires is based on a rectangular grid pattern, save for natural barriers or the relatively rare developments explicitly designed otherwise (most notably, the Parque Chas neighborhood).\n\nThe rectangular grid provides for 110-meter (361 ft)-long square blocks named manzanas.\n\nPedestrian zones in the central business district such as Florida Street are partially car-free and always bustling, access provided by bus and the Underground (subte) Line C.\n\nAirports\n--------\n\nThe Ministro Pistarini International Airport, commonly known as Ezeiza Airport, is located in the suburb of Ezeiza, in Buenos Aires Province, approximately 22 kilometers (14 miles) south of the city.\n\nThis airport handles most international air traffic to and from Argentina as well as some domestic flights.\n\nUrban Rail\n----------\n\nThe Buenos Aires Underground (locally known as subte, from \"subterráneo\" meaning underground or subway), is a high-yield system providing access to various parts of the city.\n\nOpened in 1913, it is the oldest underground system in the Southern Hemisphere and oldest in the Spanish-speaking world.\n\nThe system has six underground lines and one overground line, named by letters (A to E, and H) and there are 107 stations, and 58.8 kilometers (37 miles) of route, including the Premetro line.\n\nCycling\n--------\n\nIn December 2010, the city government launched a bicycle sharing program with bicycles free for hire by users upon registration.\n\nLocated in mostly central areas, there are 31 rental stations throughout the city providing over 850 bicycles to be picked up and dropped off at any station within an hour.\n\nAs of 2013, the city has constructed 110 kilometers (68.35 miles) of protected bicycle lanes and has plans to construct another 100 kilometers (62.14 miles).\n\nBuses\n-----\n\nThere are over 150 city bus lines called Colectivos, each one managed by an individual company.\n\nThese compete with each other and attract exceptionally high use with virtually no public financial support.\n\nTheir frequency makes them equal to the underground systems of other cities, but buses cover a far wider area than the underground system.\n\nColectivos in Buenos Aires do not have a fixed timetable, but run from four to several per hour, depending on the bus line and time of the day.\n\nWith inexpensive tickets and extensive routes, usually no further than four blocks from commuters' residences, the colectivo is the most popular mode of transport around the city.\n\nPort\n----\n\nThe port of Buenos Aires is one of the busiest in South America, as navigable rivers by way of the Rio de la Plata connect the port to northeastern Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay.\n\nAs a result, it serves as the distribution hub for said vast area of the South American continent.\n\nThe Port of Buenos Aires handles over 11,000,000 metric tons (11,000,000 long tons; 12,000,000 short tons) annually, and Dock Sud, just south of the city proper, handles another 17,000,000 metric tons (17,000,000 long tons; 19,000,000 short tons).\n\nFerries\n--------\n\nBuenos Aires is also served by a ferry system operated by the company Buquebus that connects the port of Buenos Aires with the main cities of Uruguay, (Colonia del Sacramento, Montevideo, and Punta del Este).\n\nMore than 2.2 million people per year travel between Argentina and Uruguay with Buquebus.\n\nOne of these ships is a catamaran, which can reach a top speed of about 80 kilometers per hour (50 miles per hour).\n\nTaxis\n-----\n\nA fleet of 40,000 black-and-yellow taxis ply the streets at all hours.\n\nSome taxi drivers may try to take advantage of tourists, but radio-link companies provide reliable and safe service; many such companies provide incentives for frequent users.\n\nLow-fare limo services, known as remises, are also popular, though currently giving way to ridesharing companies like Uber or Cabify, whose legal status has been the cause of much dispute with the city government.\n\nCulture\n--------\n\nBuenos Aires is sometimes referred to as the \"Paris of South America.\"\n\nThe city has the busiest live theater industry in South America.\n\nIn fact, every weekend, there are about 300 active theaters with plays, a number that places the city as 1st worldwide, more than either London, New York, or Paris, cultural Meccas in themselves.\n\nThe number of cultural festivals with more than 10 sites and five years of existence also places the city as 2nd worldwide, after Edinburgh.\n\nThe Centro Cultural Kirchner (Kirchner Cultural Center), located in Buenos Aires, is the largest cultural center of Latin America, and the third worldwide.\n\nArt\n----\n\nBuenos Aires has a thriving arts culture, with \"a huge inventory of museums, ranging from obscure to world-class.\"\n\nThe barrios of Palermo and Recoleta are the city's traditional bastions in the diffusion of art, although in recent years there has been a tendency of appearance of exhibition venues in other districts such as Puerto Madero or La Boca.\n\nRenowned venues include MALBA, the National Museum of Fine Arts, Fundación Proa, Faena Arts Center, and the Usina del Arte.\n\nOther popular institutions are the Buenos Aires Museum of Modern Art, the Benito Quinquela Martín Museum, the Evita Museum, the Museo de Arte Hispanoamericano Isaac Fernández Blanco, the José Hernández Museum, and the Palais de Glace, among others.\n\nA traditional event that occurs once a year is La Noche de los Museos (\"Night of the Museums\"), when the city's museums, universities, and artistic spaces open their doors for free until early morning; it usually takes place in November.\n\nLiterature\n------------\n\nBuenos Aires has long been considered an intellectual and literary capital of Latin America and the Spanish-speaking world.\n\nDespite its short urban history, Buenos Aires has an abundant literary production; its mythical-literary network \"has grown at the same rate at which the streets of the city earned its shores to the pampas and buildings stretched its shadow on the curb.\"\n\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, culture boomed along with the economy and the city emerged as a literary capital and the seat of South America's most powerful publishing industry.\n\nEven if the economic path grew rocky, ordinary Argentines embraced and stuck to the habit of reading.\n\nBy the 1930s, Buenos Aires was the undisputed literary capital of the Spanish-speaking world, with Victoria Ocampo founding the highly influential Sur magazine—which dominated Spanish-language literature for thirty years—and the arrival of prominent Spanish writers and editors who were escaping the civil war.\n\nMusic\n--------\n\nAccording to the Harvard Dictionary of Music, \"Argentina has one of the richest art music traditions and perhaps the most active contemporary musical life\" in South America.\n\nBuenos Aires boasts of several professional orchestras, including the Argentine National Symphony Orchestra, the Ensamble Musical de Buenos Aires, and the Camerata Bariloche; as well as various conservatories that offer professional music education, like the Conservatorio Nacional Superior de Música.\n\nAs a result of the growth and commercial prosperity of the city in the late 18th century, theater became a vital force in Argentine musical life, offering Italian and French operas and Spanish zarzuelas.\n\nItalian music was very influential during the 19th century and the early 20th century, in part because of immigration, but operas and salon music were also composed by Argentines, including Francisco Hargreaves and Juan Gutiérrez.\n\nA nationalist trend that drew from Argentine traditions, literature, and folk music was an important force during the 19th century, including composers Alberto Williams, Julián Aguirre, Arturo Berutti, and Felipe Boero.\n\nIn the 1930s, composers such as Juan Carlos Paz and Alberto Ginastera \"began to espouse a cosmopolitan and modernist style, influenced by twelve-tone techniques and serialism\"; while avant-garde music thrived by the 1960s, with the Rockefeller Foundation financing the Centro Interamericano de Altos Estudios Musicales, which brought internationally famous composers to work and teach in Buenos Aires, also establishing an electronic music studio.\n\nCinema\n--------\n\nArgentine cinema history began in Buenos Aires with the first film exhibition on 18 July 1896 at the Teatro Odeón.\n\nWith his 1897 film, La bandera Argentina, Eugène Py became one of the first filmmakers of the country; the film features a waving Argentine flag located at Plaza de Mayo.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the first movie theaters of the country opened in Buenos Aires, and newsreels appeared, most notably El Viaje de Campos Salles a Buenos Aires.\n\nThe real industry emerged with the advent of sound films, the first one being Muñequitas porteñas (1931).\n\nThe newly founded Argentina Sono Film released ¡Tango! in 1933, the first integral sound production in the country.\n\nDuring the 1930s and the 1940s (commonly referred as the \"Golden Age\" of Argentine cinema), many films revolved around the city of Buenos Aires and tango culture, reflected in titles such as La vida es un tango, El alma del bandoneón, Adiós Buenos Aires, El Cantor de Buenos Aires, and Buenos Aires canta.\n\nArgentine films were exported across Latin America, specially Libertad Lamarque's melodramas, and the comedies of Luis Sandrini and Niní Marshall.\n\nThe popularity of local cinema in the Spanish-speaking world played a key role in the massification of tango music.\n\nCarlos Gardel, an iconic figure of tango and Buenos Aires, became an international star by starring in several films during that era.\n\nFashion\n--------\n\nBuenos Aires' inhabitants have been historically characterized as \"fashion-conscious.\"\n\nNational designers display their collections annually at the Buenos Aires Fashion Week (BAFWEEK) and related events.\n\nInevitably being a season behind, it fails to receive much international attention.\n\nNevertheless, the city remains an important regional fashion capital.\n\nAccording to Global Language Monitor, as of 2017, the city is the 20th leading fashion capital in the world, ranking second in Latin America after Rio de Janeiro.\n\nIn 2005, Buenos Aires was appointed as the first UNESCO City of Design, and received this title once again in 2007.\n\nSince 2015, the Buenos Aires International Fashion Film Festival Buenos Aires (BAIFFF) takes place, sponsored by the city and Mercedes-Benz.\n\nThe government of the city also organizes La Ciudad de Moda (\"The City of Fashion\"), an annual event that serves as a platform for emerging creators and attempts to boost the sector by providing management tools.\n\nArchitecture\n------------\n\nBuenos Aires architecture is characterized by its eclectic nature, with elements resembling", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Buenos_Aires\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nAragonese archives record that Catalan missionaries and Jesuits arriving in Cagliari (Sardinia) under the Crown of Aragon, after its capture from the Pisans in 1324, established their headquarters on top of a hill that overlooked the city [24] The hill was known to them as Bonaira (or Bonaria in Sardinian), as it was free of the foul smell prevalent in the old city (the castle area), which is adjacent to swampland During the siege of Cagliari, the Catalans built a sanctuary to the Virgin Mary on top of the hill In 1335, King Alfonso the Gentle donated the church to the Mercedarians, who built an abbey that stands to this day In the years after that, a story circulated, claiming that a statue of the Virgin Mary was retrieved from the sea after it miraculously calmed a storm in the Mediterranean Sea The statue was placed in the abbey Spanish sailors, especially Andalusians, venerated this image and frequently invoked the \"Fair Winds\" to aid them in their navigation and prevent shipwrecks A sanctuary to the Virgin of Buen Ayre would later be erected in Seville [24]\n\n\nHistory\n Kingdom of Spain - Habsburg, 1536–1700 \n Kingdom of Spain - Bourbon, 1700–1808 \n Kingdom of Spain - Bonaparte, 1808–1810 \n United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, 1810–1831 \n Argentine Confederation, 1831–1852 \n State of Buenos Aires, 1852–1861 \n Argentina, 1861–present\n\n\nViceregal times\nIn 1516, navigator and explorer Juan Díaz de Solís, navigating in the name of Spain, was

established as Ciudad de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre [3] (literally \"City of Our Lady Saint Mary of the Fair Winds\") after Our Lady of Bonaria (Patroness Saint of Sardinia) on 2 February 1536 by a Spanish expedition led by Pedro de Mendoza The settlement founded by Mendoza was located in what is today the San Telmo district of Buenos Aires, south of the city center.\n\n\nWar of Independence\nDuring the British invasions of the Río de la Plata, British forces attacked Buenos Aires twice In 1806 the British successfully invaded Buenos Aires, but an army from Montevideo led by Santiago de Liniers defeated them In the brief period of British rule, the viceroy Rafael Sobremonte managed to escape to Córdoba and designated this city as capital Buenos Aires became the capital again after its recapture by Argentine forces, but Sobremonte could not resume his duties as viceroy Santiago de Liniers, chosen as new viceroy, prepared the city against a possible new British attack and repelled a second invasion by Britain in 1807 The militarization generated in society changed the balance of power favorably for the criollos (in contrast to peninsulars), as well as the development of the Peninsular War in Spain.\n\n\n19th and 20th century\nDuring most of the 19th century, the political status of the city remained a sensitive subject It was already the capital of Buenos Aires Province, and between 1853 and 1860 it was the capital of the seceded State of Buenos Aires The issue was fought out more than once on the battlefield, until the matter was finally

winner was Fernando de la Rúa, who would later become President of Argentina from 1999 to 2001.\n\n\nGeography\nThe city of Buenos Aires lies in the pampa region, with the exception of some areas such as the Buenos Aires Ecological Reserve, the Boca Juniors (football club)'s \"sports city\", Jorge Newbery Airport, the Puerto Madero neighborhood and the main port itself; these were all built on reclaimed land along the coasts of the Rio de la Plata (the world's widest river) [44] [45] [46]\n\n\nParks\nBuenos Aires has over 250 parks and green spaces, the largest concentration of which are on the city's eastern side in the neighborhoods of Puerto Madero, Recoleta, Palermo, and Belgrano Some of the most important are:\n\n\nClimate\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, Buenos Aires has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) [47] [48] As a result of maritime influences from the adjoining Atlantic Ocean, [49] the climate is temperate with extreme temperatures being rare [50] Because the city is located in an area where the Pampero and Sudestada winds pass by, [51] the weather is variable due to these contrasting air masses [52]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nSince the adoption of the city's Constitution in 1996, Buenos Aires has counted with a democratically elected executive; Article 61 of the Constitution of the states that \"Suffrage is free, equal, secret, universal, compulsory and non-accumulative Resident aliens enjoy this same right, with its corresponding obligations, on equal terms with Argentine citizens registered in the district, under the terms established by law.\" [71] The executive power is vested on the Chief of Government (Spanish: Jefe de Gobierno), who is elected alongside a Deputy Chief of Government In analogous fashion to the Vice President of Argentina, the Deputy Chief of Government presides over the city's legislative body, the City Legislature.\n\n\nGovernment structure\nSince the adoption of the city's Constitution in

power is vested on the Chief of Government (Spanish: Jefe de Gobierno), who is elected alongside a Deputy Chief of Government In analogous fashion to the Vice President of Argentina, the Deputy Chief of Government presides over the city's legislative body, the City Legislature.\n\n\nLaw enforcement\nThe Guardia Urbana de Buenos Aires (Buenos Aires Urban Guard) was a specialized civilian force of the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina, that used to deal with different urban conflicts with the objective of developing actions of prevention, dissuasion and mediation, promoting effective behaviors that guarantee the security and the integrity of public order and social coexistence The unit continuously assisted the personnel of the Argentine Federal Police, especially in emergency situations, events of massive concurrence, and protection of tourist establishments Urban Guard officials did not carry any weapons in the performing of their duties Their basic tools were a HT radio transmitter and a whistle As of March 2008 [update], the Guardia Urbana was removed.\n\n\nDemographics\nIn the census of 2010, there were 2,891,082 people residing in the city [77] The population of Greater Buenos Aires was 13,147,638 according to 2010 census data [78] The population density in Buenos Aires proper was 13,680 inhabitants per square kilometer (35,400 inhabitants/sq mi), but only about 2,400/km2 (6,200/sq mi) in the suburbs [79]\n\n\nCensus data\nIn the census of 2010, there were 2,891,082 people residing in the city [77] The population of Greater Buenos Aires was 13,147,638 according to 2010 census data [78] The population density in Buenos Aires proper was 13,680 inhabitants per square kilometer (35,400 inhabitants/sq mi), but only about 2,400/km2 (6,200/sq mi) in the suburbs [79]\n\n\nDistricts\nThe city is divided into barrios (neighborhoods) for administrative purposes, a division originally based on Catholic parroquias (parishes) [84] A common expression is that of the Cien barrios porteños (\"One hundred porteño neighborhoods\"), referring to a composition made popular in the 1940s by tango singer Alberto Castillo; however, Buenos Aires only consists of 48 official barrios There are several subdivisions of these districts, some with a long history and others that are the product of a real estate invention A notable example is Palermo – the city's largest district – which has been subdivided into various barrios, including Palermo Soho, Palermo Hollywood, Las Cañitas and Palermo viejo, among others A newer scheme has divided the city into 15 comunas (communes) [85]\n\n\nPopulation origin\nThe majority of porteños have European origins, mostly from the Andalusian, Galician, Asturian, and Basque regions of Spain, as well as the Italian regions of Calabria, Liguria, Piedmont, Lombardy, Sicily and Campania [86] [87] Unrestricted waves of European immigrants to Argentina starting in the mid-19th century significantly increased the country's population, even causing the number of porteños to triple between 1887 and 1915 from 500,000 to 1.5 million [88]\n\n\nUrban problems\nVillas miseria are a type of slum whose size ranges from small groups of precarious houses to large communities with thousands of residents [98] In rural areas, the houses in the villas miseria might be made of mud and wood Villas miseria are found around and inside the large cities of Buenos Aires, Rosario, Córdoba and Mendoza, among others.\n\n\nLanguage\nBuenos Aires' dialect of Spanish, which is known as Rioplatense Spanish, is distinguished by its use of voseo, yeísmo, and aspiration of s in various contexts It is heavily influenced by the dialects of Spanish spoken in Andalusia and Murcia and shares its features with that of other cities like Rosario and Montevideo, Uruguay In the early 20th century, Argentina absorbed millions of immigrants, many of them Italians, who spoke mostly in their local dialects (mainly Neapolitan, Sicilian and Genoese) Their adoption of Spanish was gradual, creating a pidgin of Italian dialects and Spanish that was called cocoliche Its usage declined around the 1950s A phonetic study conducted by the Laboratory for Sensory Investigations of CONICET and the University of Toronto showed that the prosody of porteño is closer to the Neapolitan language of Italy than to any other spoken language [101] Many Spanish immigrants were from Galicia, and Spaniards are still generically referred to in Argentina as gallegos (Galicians) Galician language, cuisine and culture had a major presence in the city for most of the 20th century In recent years, descendants of Galician immigrants have led a small boom in Celtic music (which also highlighted the Welsh traditions of Patagonia) Yiddish was commonly heard in Buenos Aires, especially in the Balvanera garment district and in Villa Crespo until the 1960s Most of the newer immigrants learn Spanish quickly and assimilate into city life.\n\n\nReligion\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, Buenos Aires was the second-largest Catholic city in the world after Paris [104] [105] Christianity is still the most prevalently practiced religion in Buenos Aires (~71.4%), [106] a 2019 CONICET survey on religious beliefs and attitudes found that the inhabitants of the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area (Área Metropolitana de Buenos Aires, AMBA) were 56.4% Catholic, 26.2% non-religious and 15% Evangelical; making it the region of the country with the highest proportion of irreligious people [106] A previous CONICET survey from 2008 had found that 69.1% were Catholic, 18% \"indifferent\", 9.1% Evangelical, 1.4% Jehovah's Witnesses or Mormons and 2.3% adherents to other religions [107] The comparison between both surveys reveals that the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area is the region in which the decline of Catholicism was most pronounced during the last decade [106]\n\n\nEducation\nPrimary education comprises grades 1–7 Most primary schools in the city still adhere to the traditional seven-year primary school, but kids can do grades 1–6 if their high school lasts 6 years, such as ORT Argentina Secondary education in Argentina is called Polimodal (having multiple modes) since it allows the student to choose their orientation Polimodal is usually 3 years of schooling, although some schools have a fourth year Before entering the first year of polimodal, students choose an orientation from the following five specializations Some high schools depend on the University of Buenos Aires, and these require an admission course when students are taking the last year of high school These high schools are ILSE, CNBA, Escuela Superior de Comercio Carlos Pellegrini and Escuela de Educación Técnica Profesional en Producción Agropecuaria y Agroalimentaria (School of Professional Technique Education in Agricultural and Agrifood Production) The last two do have a specific orientation In December 2006 the Chamber of Deputies of the Argentine Congress passed a new National Education Law restoring the old system of primary followed by secondary education, making secondary education obligatory and a right, and increasing the length of compulsory education to 13 years The government vowed to put the law in effect gradually, starting in 2007 [112]\n\n\nEconomy\nBuenos Aires is the financial, industrial, and commercial hub of Argentina The economy in the city proper alone, measured by gross geographic product (adjusted for purchasing power), totaled US$102.7 billion (US$34,200 per capita) in 2020 [118] and amounts to nearly a quarter of Argentina's as a whole [119] Metro Buenos Aires, according to one well-quoted study, constitutes the 13th largest economy among the world's cities in 2005 [120] The Buenos Aires Human Development Index (0.889 in 2019) is likewise high by international standards [121]\n\n\nTourism\nAccording to the World Travel & Tourism Council, [126] tourism has been growing in the Argentine capital since 2002 In a survey by the travel and tourism publication Travel + Leisure Magazine in 2008, visitors voted Buenos Aires the second most desirable city to visit after Florence, Italy [127] In 2008, an estimated 2.5 million visitors visited the city [128] Buenos Aires is an international hub of highly active and diverse nightlife with bars, dance bars and nightclubs staying open well past midnight [129] [130] [131]\n\n\nTransportation\nAccording to data released by Moovit in July 2017, the average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Buenos Aires, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 79 min 23% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 min, while 20 percent of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 8.9 km (5.5 mi), while 21% travel for over 12 km (7.5 mi) [136]\n\n\nRoads\nBuenos Aires is based on a rectangular grid pattern, save for natural barriers or the relatively rare developments explicitly designed otherwise (most notably, the Parque Chas neighborhood) The rectangular grid provides for 110-meter (361 ft)-long square blocks named manzanas Pedestrian zones in the central business district such as Florida Street are partially car-free and always bustling, access provided by bus and the Underground (subte) Line C Buenos Aires, for the most part, is a very walkable city and the majority of residents in Buenos Aires use public transport.\n\n\nAirports\nThe Ministro Pistarini International Airport, commonly known as Ezeiza Airport, is located in the suburb of Ezeiza, in Buenos Aires Province, approximately 22 km (14 mi) south of the city This airport handles most international air traffic to and from Argentina as well as some domestic flights.\n\n\nUrban rail\nThe Buenos Aires Underground (locally known as subte, from \"subterráneo\" meaning underground or subway), is a high-yield [clarification needed] system providing access to various parts of the city Opened in 1913, it is the oldest underground system in the Southern Hemisphere and oldest in the Spanish-speaking world The system has six underground lines and one overground line, named by letters (A to E, and H) and there are 107 stations, and 58.8 km (37 mi) of route, including the Premetro line [141] An expansion program is underway to extend existing lines into the outer neighborhoods and add a new north–south line Route length is expected to reach 89 km (55 mi) by 2011.\n\n\nCycling\nIn December 2010, the city government launched a bicycle sharing program with bicycles free for hire by users upon registration Located in mostly central areas, there are 31 rental stations throughout the city providing over 850 bicycles to be picked up and dropped off at any station within an hour [163] As of 2013 [update], the city has constructed 110 km (68.35 mi) of protected bicycle lanes and has plans to construct another 100 km (62.14 mi) [164] In 2015, the stations were automated and the service became 24 hours through use of a smart card or mobile phone application.\n\n\nBuses\nThere are over 150 city bus lines called Colectivos, each one managed by an individual company These compete with each other and attract exceptionally high use with virtually no public financial support [165] Their frequency makes them equal to the underground systems of other cities, but buses cover a far wider area than the underground system Colectivos in Buenos Aires do not have a fixed timetable, but run from four to several per hour, depending on the bus line and time of the day With inexpensive tickets and extensive routes, usually no further than four blocks from commuters' residences, the colectivo is the most popular mode of transport around the city [165]\n\n\nPort\nThe port of Buenos Aires is one of the busiest in South America, as navigable rivers by way of the Rio de la Plata connect the port to northeastern Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay As a result, it serves as the distribution hub for said vast area of the South American continent The Port of Buenos Aires handles over 11,000,000 metric tons (11,000,000 long tons; 12,000,000 short tons) annually, [168] and Dock Sud, just south of the city proper, handles another 17,000,000 metric tons (17,000,000 long tons; 19,000,000 short tons) [169] Tax collection related to the port has caused many political problems in the past, including a conflict in 2008 that led to protests and a strike in the agricultural sector after the government raised export tariffs [170]\n\n\nFerries\nBuenos Aires is also served by a ferry system operated by the company Buquebus that connects the port of Buenos Aires with the main cities of Uruguay, (Colonia del Sacramento, Montevideo and Punta del Este) More than 2.2 million people per year travel between Argentina and Uruguay with Buquebus One of these ships is a catamaran, which can reach a top speed of about 80 km/h (50 mph) [171]\n\n\nTaxis\nA fleet of 40,000 black-and-yellow taxis ply the streets at all hours Some taxi drivers may try to take advantage of tourists., [172] but radio-link companies provide reliable and safe service; many such companies provide incentives for frequent users Low-fare limo services, known as remises, are also popular [173] [174] though currently giving way to ridesharing companies like Uber or Cabify, whose legal status has been the cause of much dispute with the city government [175]\n\n\nCulture\nAs Buenos Aires is strongly influenced by European culture, the city is sometimes referred to as the \"Paris of South America\" [3] [176] With its scores of theaters and productions, the city has the busiest live theater industry in South America [177] In fact, every weekend, there are about 300 active theaters with plays, a number that places the city as 1st worldwide, more than either London, New York or Paris, cultural Meccas in themselves The number of cultural festivals with more than 10 sites and five years of existence also places the city as 2nd worldwide, after Edinburgh [178] The Centro Cultural Kirchner (Kirchner Cultural Center), located in Buenos Aires, is the largest cultural center of Latin America, [179] [180] and the third worldwide [181]\n\n\nArt\nBuenos Aires has a thriving arts culture, [184] with \"a huge inventory of museums, ranging from obscure to world-class.\" [185] The barrios of Palermo and Recoleta are the city's traditional bastions in the diffusion of art, although in recent years there has been a tendency of appearance of exhibition venues in other districts such as Puerto Madero or La Boca; renowned venues include MALBA, the National Museum of Fine Arts, Fundación Proa, Faena Arts Center, and the Usina del Arte [186] Other popular institutions are the Buenos Aires Museum of Modern Art, the Benito Quinquela Martín Museum, the Evita Museum, the Museo de Arte Hispanoamericano Isaac Fernández Blanco, the José Hernández Museum, and the Palais de Glace, among others [187] A traditional event that occurs once a year is La Noche de los Museos (\"Night of the Museums\"), when the city's museums, universities, and artistic spaces open their doors for free until early morning; it usually takes place in November [188] [189]\n\n\nLiterature\nBuenos Aires has long been considered an intellectual and literary capital of Latin America and the Spanish-speaking world [197] [198] Despite its short urban history, Buenos Aires has an abundant literary production; its mythical-literary network \"has grown at the same rate at which the streets of the city earned its shores to the pampas and buildings stretched its shadow on the curb.\" [199] During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, culture boomed along with the economy and the city emerged as a literary capital and the seat of South America's most powerful publishing industry, [200] and \"even if the economic path grew rocky, ordinary Argentines embraced and stuck to the habit of reading.\" [201] By the 1930s, Buenos Aires was the undisputed literary capital of the Spanish-speaking world, with Victoria Ocampo founding the highly influential Sur magazine—which dominated Spanish-language literature for thirty years— [202] and the arrival of prominent Spanish writers and editors who were escaping the civil war [201]\n\n\nMusic\nAccording to the Harvard Dictionary of Music, \"Argentina has one of the richest art music traditions and perhaps the most active contemporary musical life\" in South America [207] Buenos Aires boasts of several professional orchestras, including the Argentine National Symphony Orchestra, the Ensamble Musical de Buenos Aires and the Camerata Bariloche; as well as various conservatories that offer professional music education, like the Conservatorio Nacional Superior de Música [207] As a result of the growth and commercial prosperity of the city in the late 18th century, theater became a vital force in Argentine musical life, offering Italian and French operas and Spanish zarzuelas [207] Italian music was very influential during the 19th century and the early 20th century, in part because of immigration, but operas and salon music were also composed by Argentines, including Francisco Hargreaves and Juan Gutiérrez [207] A nationalist trend that drew from Argentine traditions, literature and folk music was an important force during the 19th century, including composers Alberto Williams, Julián Aguirre, Arturo Berutti and Felipe Boero [207] In the 1930s, composers such as Juan Carlos Paz and Alberto Ginastera \"began to espouse a cosmopolitan and modernist style, influenced by twelve-tone techniques and serialism\"; while avant-garde music thrived by the 1960s, with the Rockefeller Foundation financing the Centro Interamericano de Altos Estudios Musicales, which brought internationally famous composers to work and teach in Buenos Aires, also establishing an electronic music studio [207]\n\n\nCinema\nArgentine cinema history began in Buenos Aires with the first film exhibition on 18 July 1896 at the Teatro Odeón [211] [212] With his 1897 film, La bandera Argentina, Eugène Py became one of the first filmmakers of the country; the film features a waving Argentine flag located at Plaza de Mayo [212] In the early 20th century, the first movie theaters of the country opened in Buenos Aires, and newsreels appeared, most notably El Viaje de Campos Salles a Buenos Aires [212] The real industry emerged with the advent of sound films, the first one being Muñequitas porteñas (1931) [211] [212] The newly founded Argentina Sono Film released ¡Tango! in 1933, the first integral sound production in the country [212] During the 1930s and the 1940s (commonly referred as the \"Golden Age\" of Argentine cinema), many films revolved around the city of Buenos Aires and tango culture, reflected in titles such as La vida es un tango, El alma del bandoneón, Adiós Buenos Aires, El Cantor de Buenos Aires and Buenos Aires canta Argentine films were exported across Latin America, specially Libertad Lamarque's melodramas, and the comedies of Luis Sandrini and Niní Marshall The popularity of local cinema in the Spanish-speaking world played a key role in the massification of tango music Carlos Gardel, an iconic figure of tango and Buenos Aires, became an international star by starring in several films during that era.\n\n\nMedia\nBuenos Aires is home to five Argentine television networks: America, Television Pública Argentina, El Nueve, Telefe, and El Trece Four of them are located in Buenos Aires, and the studios of America is located in La Plata.\n\n\nFashion\nBuenos Aires' inhabitants have been historically characterized as \"fashion-conscious\" [216] [217] [218] National designers display their collections annually at the Buenos Aires Fashion Week (BAFWEEK) and related events [219] Inevitably being a season behind, it fails to receive much international attention [220] Nevertheless, the city remains an important regional fashion capital According to Global Language Monitor, as of 2017 [update] the city is the 20th leading fashion capital in the world, ranking second in Latin America after Rio de Janeiro [221] In 2005, Buenos Aires was appointed as the first UNESCO City of Design, [222] and received this title once again in 2007 [223] Since 2015, the Buenos Aires International Fashion Film Festival Buenos Aires (BAIFFF) takes place, sponsored by the city and Mercedes-Benz [224] The government of the city also organizes La Ciudad de Moda (\"The City of Fashion\"), an annual event that serves as a platform for emerging creators and attempts to boost the sector by providing management tools [225]\n\n\nArchitecture\nBuenos Aires architecture is characterized by its eclectic nature, with elements resembling Paris and Madrid There is a mix, due to immigration, of Colonial, Art Deco, Art Nouveau, Neo-Gothic, and French Bourbon styles [228] Italian and French influences increased after the declaration of independence at the beginning of the 19th century, although the academic style persisted until the first decades of the 20th century Attempts at renovation took place during the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, when European influences penetrated into the country, reflected by several buildings of Buenos Aires such as the Iglesia Santa Felicitas by Ernesto Bunge; the Palace of Justice, the National Congress, all of them by Vittorio Meano, and the Teatro Colón, by Francesco Tamburini and Vittorio Meano The simplicity of the Rioplatense baroque style is evident in Buenos Aires through the works of Italian architects such as André Blanqui and Antonio Masella, in the churches of San Ignacio, Nuestra Señora del Pilar, the Cathedral and the Cabildo.\n\n\nTheaters\nBuenos Aires has over 280 theaters, more than any other city in the world [232] Because of this, Buenos Aires is declared the \"World's Capital of Theater\" [233] They show everything from musicals to ballet, comedy to circuses [234] Some of them are:\n\n\nSports\nBuenos Aires has been a candidate city for the Summer Olympic Games on three occasions: for the 1956 Games, which were lost by a single vote to Melbourne; for the 1968 Summer Olympics, held in Mexico City; and in 2004, when the games were awarded to Athens However, Buenos Aires hosted the first Pan American Games (1951) [182] and was also host city to several World Championship events: the 1950 and 1990 Basketball World Championships, the 1982 and 2002 Men's Volleyball World Championships and, most remembered, the 1978 FIFA World Cup, won by Argentina on 25 June 1978, when it defeated the Netherlands at the Estadio Monumental 3–1 In September 2013, the city hosted the 125th IOC Session, Tokyo was elected the host city of the 2020 Summer Olympics and Thomas Bach was new IOC President Buenos Aires bid to host the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics [237] On 4 July 2013, the IOC elected Buenos Aires as the host city [22] Buenos Aires hosted the 2006 South American Games too.\n\n\nInternational relations\nBuenos Aires is twinned with the following cities: [241]\n\n\nTwin towns and sister cities\nBuenos Aires is twinned with the following cities: [241]\n\n\nUnion of Ibero-American Capital Cities\nBuenos Aires is part of the

difficult In February 2013, he and Bokenkamp invited Kiefer Sutherland, Bryan Cranston, Pierce Brosnan and Richard Gere to apply for the role of Raymond Reddington [44] In an interview to Variety, Bokenkamp told about his intentions to cast Sutherland for the role, though he also expressed doubt about the significance of the role to all these actors [44] At last, three days before filming began, they contacted James Spader to see if he would be interested in playing Reddington After a lengthy remote conversation, Bokenkamp and Eisendrath cast Spader, as they felt confident in his understanding of the character [13] Spader's vision was for the international criminal to be a bald or short-haired person wearing a hat The producers rejected his idea, however, Spader insisted on trying on a fedora while screening the pilot; later, the crew felt the hat enhanced Reddington's image and agreed to keep it [13] In an interview on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Spader admitted that he had gotten into the role of Reddington over the nine seasons; he also noted that to play his role plausibly at the beginning of season nine, he spent a considerable amount of time alone and not appearing on set [45] [46]\n\n\nMain characters\nJohn Eisendrath told Collider that the casting process was difficult In February 2013, he and Bokenkamp invited Kiefer Sutherland, Bryan Cranston,

actors in recurring roles For the pilot, Ilfenesh Hadera was cast alongside Harry Lennix, playing Jennifer Palmer, a federal agent and a friend of Elizabeth Alan Alda was cast in a major supporting role in September, as Alan Fitch, the Deputy Director of National Intelligence and one of Red's former allies [70] To bring the series closer to reality a former CIA agent, Bazzel Baz, was hired by the producers to teach CIA techniques on assaulting buildings to the crew Baz instead contacted old associates for the scenes, and went on to play a role in the show that was similar to his own experiences in the CIA [71] [72] Chin Han and Margarita Levieva were among the blacklisters besides Peter Stormare as Berlin [73] [74] Susan Blommaert and Teddy Coluca also began starring as Reddington's valuable team members [75] [76]\n\n\nFilming\nDespite being set in Washington, D.C., the series is filmed in New York The series' Task Force headquarters are located at Chelsea Piers which was mostly used while filming Law & Order Producer Richard Heus said they chose to film specific Washington, D.C locations for the series, including the Lincoln Memorial, the Washington Monument, and the National Mall, because they were \"iconic American locations.\" [131] All the sets, excluding the Task Force headquarters, are either shot in different locations of the state [b] or are filmed in special sound studios [136] The process of filming a single episode usually takes an average of nine days, while sometimes two episodes may be filmed simultaneously in order to save time

original plot and cast performance, especially by Spader At the time, it was usually compared with Hostages, which premiered alongside the series, and Homeland due to the mutual connection between the characters of Reddington and Nicholas Brody and the transfer of Diego Klattenhoff, comparing him to Homeland's Mike Faber David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle said about the pilot, \"You think you know this situation and how it will turn out, but there are surprising, yet entirely credible, twists throughout Monday's episode\" [181] Brian Lowry said about the second season, \"At times during its first season, 'The Blacklist' felt like two series in one: The very good one  starring James Spader as a ruthless criminal, and the more mundane procedural in which he had taken refuge Thanks to the show's success, though, NBC and the producers have little reason to tinker with that formula, other than having Spader's 'Red' Reddington assume an expanded role within the premiere, while tapping some fine new actors to join (temporarily, perhaps) the program's extended company\" [182] Canadian television critic John Doyle from The Globe and Mail wrote a glowing review on the third season, praising Spader's performance, the soundtrack and the plot He called the series \"outstanding and inventing\" and wrote, \"Network drama isn't dead as long as something like The Blacklist can be created and thrive\" [183]\n\n\nCritical response\nThe first seasons of The Blacklist received mostly positive reviews from television critics The pilot was lauded by the critics,

season, \"At times during its first season, 'The Blacklist' felt like two series in one: The very good one  starring James Spader as a ruthless criminal, and the more mundane procedural in which he had taken refuge Thanks to the show's success, though, NBC and the producers have little reason to tinker with that formula, other than having Spader's 'Red' Reddington assume an expanded role within the premiere, while tapping some fine new actors to join (temporarily, perhaps) the program's extended company\" [182] Canadian television critic John Doyle from The Globe and Mail wrote a glowing review on the third season, praising Spader's performance, the soundtrack and the plot He called the series \"outstanding and inventing\" and wrote, \"Network drama isn't dead as long as something

series that premiered on September 23, 2013, on NBC. The series was created by Jon Bokenkamp and stars James Spader as Raymond \"Red\" Reddington, a high-profile criminal who turns himself in and offers to cooperate with the FBI in exchange for immunity.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe series follows the story of Raymond Reddington, a high-profile criminal who turns himself in to the FBI after a 20-year absence. Reddington claims to have information about some of the world's most notorious criminals and offers to share this information with the FBI in exchange for immunity. The series focuses on the cat-and-mouse game between Reddington and the FBI, as well as the personal struggles and relationships of the characters.\n\nIn every episode, Reddington assists the task force in hunting down and capturing a global criminal. The rank and name or alias of the featured criminal is displayed at the close of the opening sequence. Otherwise, only the episode name is shown. The action takes place primarily in present-day Washington D.C., although other locations around the world are featured occasionally.\n\n**Seasons 1–8**\n\nThe series begins with Reddington surrendering himself to FBI Assistant Director Harold Cooper at the J Edgar Hoover Building in Washington D.C. Reddington declares he wishes to help the FBI track down and apprehend the criminals and terrorists he has spent the last 20 years associating with. These are individuals who are so dangerous and devious that the United States government is unaware of their very existence.\n\nThroughout the series, Reddington forms a close relationship with Elizabeth Keen, a rookie FBI agent who becomes his handler. The series also follows the personal struggles and relationships of the characters, including Cooper's task force and Reddington's mysterious past.\n\n**Seasons 9–10**\n\nFollowing Liz's death at the end of the eighth season, Cooper's task force has disbanded and Reddington has fled the country. After an absence of two years, however, Reddington returns to help his former bodyguard, Dembe Zuma, who has in the interim become an FBI Special Agent with the assistance of Cooper, when a modern pirate named the \"Skinner\" nearly kills him. Red promises to retire and move to Cuba with his girlfriend once the Skinner is neutralized. However, when Red begins to take over management of the remains of his empire, he breaks his promise and decides to stay in charge of what he can still control.\n\n**Cast and characters**\n\nThe idea for The Blacklist was to center a show that is about catching bad guys but with a bad guy at the center of it. This came about at around the same time that the real-world criminal Whitey Bulger was found. The idea was, \"Well, what would happen if a man like him turned himself in and said, 'I am here I have some rules that I want you to follow, but if you follow them I will give you the names of people that I have worked with, during the 20 years that I have been a fugitive.'\"\n\nThe main cast of the series includes James Spader as Raymond Reddington, Megan Boone as Elizabeth Keen, Diego Klattenhoff as Donald Ressler, and Ryan Eggold as Tom Keen. The supporting cast includes Harry Lennix as Harold Cooper, Amir Arison as Aram Mojtabai, and Mozhan Marnò as Samar Navabi.\n\n**Recurring actors**\n\nThe first season introduced several well-known actors in recurring roles. For the pilot, Ilfenesh Hadera was cast alongside Harry Lennix, playing Jennifer Palmer, a federal agent and a friend of Elizabeth. Alan Alda was cast in a major supporting role in September, as Alan Fitch, the Deputy Director of National Intelligence and one of Red's former allies. Chin Han and Margarita Levieva were among the blacklisters besides Peter Stormare as Berlin.\n\n**Filming**\n\nDespite being set in Washington D.C., the series is filmed in New York. The series' Task Force headquarters are located at Chelsea Piers, which was mostly used while filming Law & Order. The producers chose to film specific Washington D.C locations for the series, including the Lincoln Memorial, the Washington Monument, and the National Mall, because they were \"iconic American locations.\" All the sets, excluding the Task Force headquarters, are either shot in different locations of the state or are filmed in special sound studios. The process of filming a single episode usually takes an average of nine days, while sometimes two episodes may be filmed simultaneously in order to save time.\n\n**Broadcast**\n\nThe series has been broadcast in many countries around the world. In Asia and Oceania, the series is broadcast by AXN Asia. In Latin America and Brazil, the series was broadcast by AXN Latin America and AXN Brazil, respectively. In Spain and Portugal, the series was broadcast by AXN Portugal, with the tenth season premiering on February 28, 2023. In Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, the ninth season was due to premiere on August 2, 2022, on Sony AXN.\n\n**Ratings**\n\nThe series has received generally positive reviews from critics. The pilot was lauded by the critics, praising the original plot and cast performance, especially by Spader. The series has been compared to other crime dramas, such as Hostages and Homeland. The series has also been praised for its complex characters and plot twists.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nThe series has won several awards and nominations, including a People's Choice Award for Favorite New TV Drama and a Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series for James Spader.\n\n**Other media**\n\nThe series has also been adapted into a comic book series, written by Nicole Phillips and illustrated by Beni Lobel. The comic book series follows the story of the series and introduces new characters and plotlines.\n\n**Games**\n\nThe series has also been adapted into a mobile game, The Blacklist: Conspiracy, which was released on June 23, 2016, by Gameloft for Android, iOS, and Windows devices. The game follows the story of the series and allows players to interact with the characters and solve puzzles.\n\n**City Hunt**\n\nNBC announced during Super Bowl XLIX that The Blacklist would change its slot from Mondays to Thursdays after the airing of the second-season episode \"Luther Braxton\" and launched a city scavenger hunt event called Red Is on the Run to Thursdays (originally Red Across America).

Eisendrath told Collider that the casting process was difficult In February 2013, he and Bokenkamp invited Kiefer Sutherland, Bryan Cranston, Pierce Brosnan and Richard Gere to apply for the role of Raymond Reddington [44] In an interview to Variety, Bokenkamp told about his intentions to cast Sutherland for the role, though he also expressed doubt about the significance of the role to all these actors [44] At last, three days before filming began, they contacted James Spader to see if he would be interested in playing Reddington After a lengthy remote conversation, Bokenkamp and Eisendrath cast Spader, as they felt confident in his understanding of the character [13] Spader's vision was for the international criminal to be a bald or short-haired person wearing a hat The producers rejected his idea, however, Spader insisted on trying on a fedora while screening the pilot; later, the crew felt the hat enhanced Reddington's image and agreed to keep it [13] In an interview on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Spader admitted that he had gotten into the role of Reddington over the nine seasons; he also noted that to play his role plausibly at the beginning of season nine, he spent a considerable amount of time alone and not appearing on set [45] [46]\n\n\nMain characters\nJohn Eisendrath told Collider that the casting process was difficult In February 2013, he and Bokenkamp

He first appears in \"The Sandman\" #10, published in 1989. The Corinthian is a supernatural being tasked with serving as a \"black mirror\" to humanity, reflecting their deepest fears and darkest impulses.\n\n**Abilities**\n\nThe Corinthian possesses several abilities that make him a formidable and unsettling figure. He claims to have excellent eyesight, which allows him to see his surroundings with great clarity even in the darkness. In one instance, he is shown driving a car at night while wearing sunglasses, suggesting a level of visual acuity that is almost supernatural.\n\nOne of the Corinthian's most striking abilities is his capacity to consume the eyes of humans through his own socket/mouths. This allows him to view the memories and experiences of those whose eyes he has eaten. He can also see into the future, granting him a level of foresight that is both fascinating and terrifying.\n\nThe Corinthian can also embody himself in human beings, a process that involves the consumption of the victim's eyes and the replacement of their own with his teeth. As a result, the victim's hair turns white, and their eye sockets bleed profusely. The Corinthian can then impersonate his victims, taking on their features and characteristics.\n\n**Occurrences**\n\nThe Corinthian first appears in \"The Sandman\" #10, where he is shown to be AWOL from the dreamscape following Morpheus's escape from capture.

The series takes place in Venice, in the year 1920, and features a cast of characters that includes Charles Constantine, a World War I veteran who has repeatedly struggled with his inability to kill. The Corinthian's origins are tied to the spirit of Stefan Wasserman, a young German soldier who was murdered by Constantine's commanding officer.\n\n**The Dreaming**\n\nThe new Corinthian is back again in \"The Dreaming\" spinoff, returning to earth for the three-part \"Souvenirs\" storyline. He hunts down a transgender woman named Echo, who was previously a murderer who cut out the eyes of her victims, following the instructions of her boyfriend Gabriel who was one of the only surviving victims of the first Corinthian. As a result of this, the Corinthian is turned into a mortal and Echo (made a cisgender female in the Dreaming) is given his position. As a mortal, he develops compassion for humans and comes to understand fear, especially after the death of his lover Sila. He is eventually deemed fit to come back and serve as the Corinthian, with Daniel Hall finding another place for Echo.\n\n**Nightmare Country**\n\nThe second Corinthian continues his duties as humanity's black mirror and has developed several methods to keep his more volatile impulses in check, including keeping a record of the memories of his predecessor.

{"title": "George_Stinney", "content": "\nBackground\nIn 1944, George Stinney stood 5 feet 1 inch (154 cm), and weighed 90–95 pounds (40–43 kg) He lived in a small home with a chicken coop in his hometown of Alcolu, South Carolina, with his father, George Junius Stinney Sr (1902–1965), mother Aimé Brown Stinney (1907–1989), brother Charles Stinney, 12, and sisters Katherine Stinney, 10, and Aimé Stinney Ruffner, 7 Stinney's father worked at the town's sawmill, and the family resided in company housing Alcolu was a small, working-class mill town, where white and black neighborhoods were separated by railroad tracks The town was typical of small Southern towns of the time Given segregated schools and churches for white and black residents, there was limited interaction between them [6]\n\n\nInvestigation\nGeorge and his older brother John were arrested on suspicion of murdering the girls John was released by police, but George was held in custody He was not allowed to see his parents until after his trial and conviction [6] According to a handwritten statement, his arresting officer was H.S Newman, a Clarendon County deputy, who stated, \"I arrested a boy by the name of George Stinney He then made a confession and told me where to find a piece of iron, about 15 inches where he said he put it in a ditch about six feet from the bicycle.\" [6] [12]\n\n\nTrial\nThe entire proceeding against George Stinney, including jury selection, took place on April 24, 1944 Stinney's court-appointed counsel was Charles Plowden, a tax commissioner campaigning for election to local office Plowden did not challenge the three police officers who testified that Stinney confessed to the two murders, nor did he try to defend Stinney He also did not challenge the prosecution's presentation of two differing versions of Stinney's verbal confession In one version, Stinney was attacked by the girls after he tried to help one girl who had fallen in the ditch, and he killed them in self defense In the other version, he had followed the girls, first attacking Mary Emma and then Betty June [6] There is no written record of Stinney's confession apart from Deputy Newman's statement [7]\n\n\nExecution\nStinney was executed on Friday, June 16, 1944, at 7:30 a.m He was prepared for execution by electric chair, using a Bible as a booster seat because Stinney was too small for the chair [28] He was then restrained by his arms, legs, and body to the chair An officer asked George if he had any last words to say before the execution took place, but he only shook his head and said \"No, sir.\" The executioner pulled a strap from the chair and placed it over George's mouth, causing him to break into tears, and he then placed the face mask over his face, which did not fit him, as he continued sobbing [29] When the lethal electricity was applied, the mask covering slipped off, revealing tears streaming down Stinney's face [28] [30] This perception was later contested by Terri Evans, the niece of Mary Emma Thames' mother, Lula Mae Terri's uncle, Clyde Barnes, witnessed the execution Barnes told Evans' father what he saw during the execution, which was then relayed to her years later Her father stated that Barnes \"said it was just a rumor that the hood had slipped and they did not put a stack of books under him.\" [16] Stinney was buried in an unmarked grave at the Calvary Baptist Church Cemetery in Lee County, South Carolina [31]\n\n\nReopening of case and vacatur of conviction\nIn 2004, George Frierson, a local historian who grew up in Alcolu, started researching the case after reading a newspaper article about it His work gained the attention of South Carolina lawyers Steve McKenzie and Matt Burgess [6] In addition, Ray Brown, attorney James Moon, and others contributed countless hours of research and review of historical documents, and found witnesses and evidence to assist in exonerating Stinney Among those who aided the case were the Civil Rights and Restorative Justice Project (CRRJ) at the Northeastern University School of Law, which filed an amicus brief with the court in 2014 [32] Frierson and the pro bono lawyers first sought relief through the Pardon and Parole Board of South Carolina.\n\n\nReaction of Binnicker and Thames's relatives\nWhile Stinney's family and civil rights advocates celebrated the overturning of Stinney's conviction, relatives of both Betty Binnicker and Mary Thames expressed disappointment at the court's ruling They said that although they acknowledge Stinney's execution at the age of 14 is controversial, they never doubted his guilt Binnicker's niece claimed she and her family have extensively researched the case, and argues that \"people who  [just] read these articles in the newspaper don't know the truth.\" [38] She alleges that, in the early 1990s, a police officer who had arrested Stinney had contacted her and said, \"Don't you ever believe that boy didn't kill your aunt.\" [38] These family members contend that the claims of a deathbed confession from an individual confessing to the girls' murders have never been substantiated [38] Commenting on the public opinion regarding Stinney's case, she said that the case has always been \"one-sided\" and that Stinney has been incorrectly portrayed as a \"poor pitiful little black boy\" [39] At the same time, another niece of Binnicker, while remaining convinced of Stinney's guilt, agreed that Stinney did not receive a fair trial and that he should not have received the death penalty, adding that she felt bad for Stinney and his family and that she hoped they eventually would find peace A childhood acquaintance of Binnicker also stated, \"I'm sorry that they electrocuted him I wish they had just sent him to prison.\" [40]\n\n\nAlternate suspect\nSince Stinney's exoneration, George Washington Burke Jr (1917–1947) the son of a wealthy white businessman, George Burke Sr., has been the subject of speculation as a possible suspect for the murders George Burke Jr died two to three years after the murders of the two girls, in 1947, at age 29 Stinney's mother had worked for the Burke family for a brief period Stinney's sister recalled that her mother had once come home saying that Burke Sr had made advances to her, and their father had told their mother to no longer go back Stinney's sister claimed to have heard that the Burke boys had framed Stinney because \" [their] mother didn't want to give it up.\" Burke Sr conducted an initial search for the girls and was the owner of the territory behind Greenhill Baptist Church where the girls' bodies were found He was also the foreman of the grand jury that indicted Stinney, and has been accused of helping steer the blame off of his son and onto Stinney [41] Two elderly women in Alcolu recalled that Burke Jr was known as a womanizer and for committing theft and getting away with it [41] [42]\n\n\nLegacy\nGeorge Stinney's case has been frequently referred to in debate over the use of the death penalty in the United States, especially in arguments against the death penalty, due to common belief that Stinney was innocent and wrongfully executed [43]\n\n\nBooks and films about Stinney's case\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "George Stinney\n\nGeorge Stinney was a 14-year-old African American boy who was wrongly convicted and executed for the murder of two young white girls, Betty Binnicker and Mary Thames, in Alcolu, South Carolina, in 1944.

Ipswich, Queensland, and attended Woodcrest State College throughout her upbringing [14] [15] She has two older sisters named Sara and Ali [13] Besides tennis, Barty also played netball as a child,

I'd been coaching and holding a racket pretty much every day so I wasn't completely out of practice.\" [193] During her time off, she also pursued her hobbies such as fishing, and built a new house close to her family [13] She ultimately decided to return to the sport, commenting, \"After a break and trying other things, I missed tennis and decided that I wanted to come back.\" [16]\n\n\nCareer statistics\nITF awards\n\n\nGrand Slam performance timelines\nITF awards\n\n\nSingles\nITF awards\n\n\nDoubles\nITF awards\n\n\nGrand Slam tournament finals\nITF awards\n\n\nSingles: 3 (3 titles)\nITF awards\n\n\nDoubles: 6 (1 title, 5 runner-ups)\nITF awards\n\n\nYear-end championship finals\nITF awards\n\n\nSingles: 1 (1 title)\nITF awards\n\n\nOlympic medal matches\nITF awards\n\n\nMixed doubles: 1 (1 bronze medal)\nITF awards\n\n\nAwards\nITF awards\n\n\nNotes\n Chris Evert (1975/1985 – 260 w)\n Evonne Goolagong (1976 – 2 w)\n Martina Navratilova (1978/1987 – 331 w)\n Tracy Austin (1980 – 22 w)\n Steffi Graf (1987/1997 – 377 w)\n// Monica Seles (1991/1996 – 178 w)\n Arantxa Sánchez Vicario (1995 – 12 w)\n Martina Hingis (1997/2001 – 209 w)\n Lindsay Davenport (1998/2006 – 98 w)\n Jennifer Capriati (2001/2002 – 17 w)\n Venus Williams (2002 – 11 w)\n Serena Williams (2002/2017 – 319 w)\n Kim Clijsters (2003/2011 – 20 w)\n Justine Henin (2003/2008 – 117 w)\n Amélie Mauresmo (2004/2006 – 39 w)\n Maria Sharapova (2005/2012 – 21 w)\n Ana Ivanovic (2008 – 12 w)\n Jelena Janković (2008/2009 – 18 w)\n Dinara Safina (2009 – 26 w)\n Caroline Wozniacki (2010/2018 – 71 w)\n Victoria Azarenka (2012/2013 – 51 w)\n Angelique Kerber (2016/2017 – 34 w)\n Karolína Plíšková (2017 – 8 w)\n Garbiñe Muguruza (2017 – 4 w)\n Simona Halep (2017/2019 – 64 w)\n Naomi Osaka (2019 – 25 w)\n Ashleigh Barty (2019/2022 – 121 w)\n Iga Świątek (2022/2024 – 125 w)\n Aryna Sabalenka (2023/2024 – 9 w)\n\n\nReferences\n Chris Evert (1975/1985 – 260 w)\n Evonne Goolagong (1976 – 2 w)\n Martina Navratilova (1978/1987 – 331 w)\n Tracy Austin (1980 – 22 w)\n Steffi Graf (1987/1997 – 377 w)\n// Monica Seles (1991/1996 – 178 w)\n Arantxa Sánchez Vicario (1995 – 12 w)\n Martina Hingis (1997/2001 – 209 w)\n Lindsay Davenport (1998/2006 – 98 w)\n Jennifer Capriati (2001/2002 – 17 w)\n Venus Williams (2002 – 11 w)\n Serena Williams (2002/2017 – 319 w)\n Kim Clijsters (2003/2011 – 20 w)\n Justine Henin (2003/2008 – 117 w)\n Amélie Mauresmo (2004/2006 – 39 w)\n Maria Sharapova (2005/2012 – 21 w)\n Ana Ivanovic (2008 – 12 w)\n Jelena Janković (2008/2009 – 18 w)\n Dinara Safina (2009 – 26 w)\n Caroline Wozniacki (2010/2018 – 71 w)\n Victoria Azarenka (2012/2013 – 51 w)\n Angelique Kerber (2016/2017 – 34 w)\n Karolína Plíšková (2017 – 8 w)\n Garbiñe Muguruza (2017 – 4 w)\n Simona Halep (2017/2019 – 64 w)\n Naomi Osaka (2019 – 25 w)\n Ashleigh Barty (2019/2022 – 121 w)\n Iga Świątek (2022/2024 – 125 w)\n Aryna Sabalenka (2023/2024 – 9 w)\n\n\nExternal links\n Chris Evert (1975/1985 – 260 w)\n Evonne Goolagong (1976 – 2 w)\n Martina Navratilova (1978/1987 – 331 w)\n Tracy Austin (1980 – 22 w)\n Steffi Graf (1987/1997 – 377 w)\n// Monica Seles (1991/1996 – 178 w)\n Arantxa Sánchez Vicario (1995 – 12 w)\n Martina Hingis (1997/2001 – 209 w)\n Lindsay Davenport (1998/2006 – 98 w)\n Jennifer Capriati (2001/2002 – 17 w)\n Venus Williams (2002 – 11 w)\n Serena Williams (2002/2017 – 319 w)\n Kim Clijsters (2003/2011 – 20 w)\n Justine Henin (2003/2008 – 117 w)\n Amélie Mauresmo (2004/2006 – 39 w)\n Maria Sharapova (2005/2012 – 21 w)\n Ana Ivanovic (2008 – 12 w)\n Jelena Janković (2008/2009 – 18 w)\n Dinara Safina (2009 – 26 w)\n Caroline Wozniacki (2010/2018 – 71 w)\n Victoria Azarenka (2012/2013 – 51 w)\n Angelique Kerber (2016/2017 – 34 w)\n Karolína Plíšková (2017 – 8 w)\n Garbiñe Muguruza (2017 – 4 w)\n Simona Halep (2017/2019 – 64 w)\n Naomi Osaka (2019 – 25 w)\n Ashleigh Barty (2019/2022 – 121 w)\n Iga Świątek (2022/2024 – 125 w)\n Aryna Sabalenka (2023/2024 – 9 w)\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Ashleigh Barty\n\nAshleigh Jacinta Barty, known as \"Ash\", is an Australian professional tennis player. She was born on 24 April 1996 in Ipswich, Queensland, Australia. Barty is a former world No. 1 in singles and has won four Grand Slam titles, including the 2022 Wimbledon Championships.\n\nEarly life and background\nAshleigh Barty was born to Josie and Robert Barty in Ipswich, Queensland, Australia. Her father grew up in the rural North Queensland town of Bowen, where he became a Queensland and Australian representative in golf. He later worked for the State Library of Queensland. Barty's mother is the daughter of English immigrants and was a state representative for Queensland in golf in her younger years. She began working as a radiographer after retiring from golf. Through her great-grandmother, Barty is of the Indigenous Australian Ngaragu people, the Aboriginal people of southern New South Wales and northeastern Victoria. Barty grew up in Springfield, a suburb of Ipswich, Queensland, and attended Woodcrest State College throughout her upbringing. She has two older sisters named Sara and Ali. Besides tennis, Barty also played netball as a child, but decided to focus on tennis because she \"thought netball was a girls' game\" and because her sisters were better than her at that sport.\n\nJunior career\nBarty reached a career-high ITF world junior ranking of No 2, having excelled at both singles and doubles. She started playing low-level events on the ITF Junior Circuit in 2009 at the age of 13 and won her first title at the Grade-4 Australian International before turning 14. Barty continued to play only in tournaments below the higher tiers until the end of 2010, compiling a record of 24–2 in her five events that season while also capturing a Grade 2 title in Thailand. She played her first junior Grand Slam event in 2011 at the Australian Open, where she lost her opening match to third seed Lauren Davis. However, she bounced back from this defeat in the coming months by winning both the singles and doubles events at two high-level Grade 1 events, the Sarawak Chief Minister's Cup in Malaysia in March and the Belgian International Junior Championships in May.\n\nProfessional career\nBarty started her professional career in April 2010 just after turning 14 at an ITF Women's Circuit $25K event in her hometown of Ipswich. She lost her first match to Karolina Wlodarczak. Barty played in one more main draw that year in Mount Gambier, where she reached the semifinals in just her second professional tournament. Her first pro match win came against Ayu Fani Damayanti. In 2011, she entered three more $25K events in Australia, with her best results being two quarterfinals. Following her girls' singles title at Wimbledon, Tennis Australia awarded Barty a wildcard into qualifying at the US Open. In her first WTA Tour-level appearance, she was unable to qualify for the main draw, losing her opening round match to Julia Glushko. Barty closed out the year by competing in a playoff for one of the Australian wildcard berths into the main draw of the 2012 Australian Open. Despite being the youngest player in the competition, she won all five of her matches without dropping a set to earn the wildcard. She swept her round-robin group featuring world No 133 Casey Dellacqua before defeating No 239 Arina Rodionova and No 167 Olivia Rogowska in the knockout stage.\n\n2010–2012: Australian Open debut, top 200\nBarty started her professional career in April 2010 just after turning 14 at an ITF Women's Circuit $25K event in her hometown of Ipswich. She lost her first match to Karolina Wlodarczak. Barty played in one more main draw that year in Mount Gambier, where she reached the semifinals in just her second professional tournament. Her first pro match win came against Ayu Fani Damayanti. In 2011, she entered three more $25K events in Australia, with her best results being two quarterfinals.

She swept her round-robin group featuring world No 133 Casey Dellacqua before defeating No 239 Arina Rodionova and No 167 Olivia Rogowska in the knockout stage.\n\n2013–2014: Breakthrough in doubles\nIn 2013, Barty began playing primarily at the WTA Tour level. She only played in eight singles main draws in total after losing in qualifying at five tournaments. Although she stayed outside the top 100 in singles throughout the year, she established herself as one of the world's elite double players despite not turning 17 until the middle of the season.\n\nSingles: First WTA Tour, Grand Slam match wins\nBarty was awarded another wildcard into the 2013 Australian Open singles main draw, but lost her opening match. Towards the end of February, she won her first two WTA Tour-level matches at the Malaysian Open against Chanel Simmonds and Zarina Diyas before her run ended in the quarterfinals. Barty's only other two tour-level singles wins of 2013 came at Grand Slam tournaments. She was awarded main draw wildcards into the French Open and US Open, where she won her first round matches at both events.\n\nDoubles: Three major finals, first WTA title\nIn doubles, Barty partnered with Dellacqua in eight WTA Tour-level events during the 2013 season, including all four Grand Slam tournaments. The pair finished runner-up in three out of four such events, only failing to reach the final at the French Open, where they lost in the first round. At the age of 16, Barty's Australian Open finals appearance made her the youngest Grand Slam finalist since Tatiana Golovin won the mixed doubles title at the 2004 French Open at the same age. As a team, Barty and Dellacqua became the first Australian duo to reach an Australian Open women's doubles final since Evonne Goolagong and Helen Gourlay in 1977. This success also helped Barty advance nearly 100 spots in the world rankings to No 46. At Wimbledon and the US Open, Barty and Dellacqua defeated three of the top-ten seeds at both events. The closest they came to winning a major title was at the Australian Open and the US Open, where they were up a break with a set in hand in both finals.\n\nTennis hiatus, switch to cricket\nAfter the 2014 US Open, Barty announced she was \"taking a break from professional tennis.\" She later said that she took time off from tennis because \"it was too much too quickly for me as I've been travelling from quite a young age... I wanted to experience life as a normal teenaged girl and have some normal experiences.\" Barty was ranked outside of the top 200 in singles and was No 40 in doubles at the time.\n\n2016–2018: Tennis return, US Open doubles champion\nBarty announced her return to professional tennis in February after the end of the WBBL season. She initially only competed in doubles events on the ITF Circuit at the $25K-level. In her first two months, she played five tournaments and won three of them, including her first one back where she partnered with Jessica Moore and two in back-to-back weeks in Canberra.\n\nSingles: First WTA title, WTA Elite Trophy, world No. 15\nAt the start of the 2017 season, Barty picked up her first career wins at the Australian Open, reaching the third round. Barty's next tournament was the Malaysian Open, where she had won her first WTA singles match four years earlier. She entered the singles main draw as a qualifier and won both the singles and doubles events. This was her first career WTA singles title and helped her enter the top 100 for the first time. Barty continued to climb the rankings after a quarterfinal showing at the Internationaux de Strasbourg on clay, where she lost to compatriot Daria Gavrilova, and a runner-up at Birmingham on grass, her best result at a Premier tournament.\n\nDoubles: First Grand Slam and Premier Mandatory titles, world No. 5\nIn 2017, Barty reunited with Dellacqua as her regular doubles partner. The pair reached the quarterfinals or better at three out of four Grand Slam tournaments during the season. In particular, they made it to the finals at the French Open to become the first Australian women's doubles team to reach all four Grand Slam finals. They lost in the final to the top seeded team of Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Lucie Šafářová, who had also won the previous two majors. Barty and Dellacqua contested six finals on the year, winning half of them. They won the Birmingham Classic, where Barty also made it to the final in singles. This was their second career title at the event and also their first Premier title together.\n\n2019–2020: French Open champion, singles No. 1\nFor the second consecutive year, Barty began the season with a runner-up finish at the Sydney International, this time losing to Petra Kvitová. During the event, she defeated three top 15 players, including Simona Halep for her first career victory over a current world No 1 player. At her next tournament, Barty made her first Grand Slam quarterfinal at the Australian Open, defeating Maria Sharapova before again losing to Kvitová, becoming the first Australian to make the quarterfinals at the event since Jelena Dokic in 2009. After a fourth-round appearance at the Indian Wells Open, Barty won the Miami Open for her first Premier Mandatory title. She defeated three top-10 players in the event, including No 2 Kvitová in the quarterfinals and No 7 Karolína Plíšková in the final. With this result, she also made her top-10 debut.\n\nSingles: Wimbledon and Australian Open champion, 100 weeks at No. 1\nBarty began the season with a runner-up finish at the Sydney International, losing to Petra Kvitová. During the event, she defeated three top 15 players, including Simona Halep for her first career victory over a current world No 1 player. At her next tournament, Barty made her first Grand Slam quarterfinal at the Australian Open, defeating Maria Sharapova before again losing to Kvitová, becoming the first Australian to make the quarterfinals at the event since Jelena Dokic in 2009. After a fourth-round appearance at the Indian Wells Open, Barty won the Miami Open for her first Premier Mandatory title. She defeated three top-10 players in the event, including No 2 Kvitová in the quarterfinals and No 7 Karolína Plíšková in the final. With this result, she also made her top-10 debut.\n\nDoubles: Spare play, Olympic bronze\nIn 2021, Barty started to partner with Jennifer Brady. The pair only played a few tournaments together, withdrawing from the Australian Open and French Open due to injuries. However, they managed to win the title in Stuttgart. Barty also partnered with Storm Sanders in the women's doubles at the 2020 Olympics, where they reached the quarterfinals. In mixed doubles, Barty partnered John Peers, where they won bronze. This was the first Australian medal in an Olympic mixed doubles competition.\n\nRetirement\nOn 23 March 2022, Barty announced her retirement from tennis. She explained that she no longer had the physical drive or emotional want to challenge herself at the top level. Barty became the second player to retire while holding the No 1 ranking after Justine Henin. In her autobiography, Barty detailed that after winning Wimbledon, \"the one true dream that I wanted in tennis\", she started to lose her motivation to keep playing.\n\nNational representation\nBarty made her Fed Cup debut for Australia in 2013, playing in two away ties. In their February defeat to the top-seeded Czech Republic, she lost the dead rubber doubles match with Casey Dellacqua. Two months later against Switzerland, Barty won her only match against No 56 Stefanie Vögele to clinch the tie for Australia and keep them in the top-level World Group the following year.\n\nHopman Cup\nIn 2018, Barty partnered Nick Kyrgios in the Hopman Cup, where they won the title. They defeated Germany in the final, winning two rubbers in singles and one in mixed doubles.\n\nOlympic Games\nBarty represented Australia at the 2020 Summer Olympics in three events. In singles, she was seeded number 1 and lost to Sara Sorribes Tormo in round 1. In doubles, Barty partnered Storm Sanders, where they reached the quarterfinals. In mixed doubles, Barty partnered John Peers, where they won bronze.\n\nPlaying style\nBarty has an all-court game and a crafty style of play. Her favourite surface is grass, despite initially not liking that surface because she had limited experience playing on it while growing up. Barty also performs well on hard courts, where she won her first WTA singles title and reached her first Premier 5 level final.\n\nPersonal life\nBarty took a break from professional tennis from September 2014 until February 2016, and played semi-professional cricket during the second half of that hiatus. Although she gave no reasons at the time, she later said, \"I needed some time to refresh mentally more than anything. It became a bit of a slog for me and I wasn't enjoying my tennis as much as I would have liked to.\" Her family and coaches all supported her decision.\n\nCareer statistics\nITF awards\n\nGrand Slam

the \"raw and honest\" portrayal of drug use and other teenage problems in the Israeli series [31] In a press release, Orsi described the series as \"Kids meets Trainspotting\" with no parental supervision [32]\n\n\nProduction team\nEuphoria is a co-production of The Reasonable Bunch, A24, Little Lamb, DreamCrew, and HBO Entertainment [37] It has 16 executive producers, including Levinson, Leshem, Levin, Yardeni, Hadas Mozes Lichtenstein, Mirit Toovi, Yoram Mokadi, Gary Lennon, Zendaya, Canadian rapper Drake, Future the Prince, Ravi Nandan, and Kevin Turen [36] [38] [39] The pilot episode was directed by Augustine Frizzell [40]\n\n\nCasting\nIn June 2018, it was announced that the pilot would star Zendaya, Storm Reid, Maude Apatow, Astro, Eric Dane, Angus Cloud, Alexa Demie, Jacob Elordi, Barbie Ferreira, Nika King, Hunter Schafer, and Sydney Sweeney [70] In October, Algee Smith was cast to replace Astro as McKay, and Austin Abrams had also been cast [71] Astro reportedly quit the series after shooting the pilot as he was uncomfortable with the sexual content involving his character [72]\n\n\nFilming\nPrimary photography takes place in Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California Grant High School in Los Angeles stands in for the fictional East Highland High School [79] The exterior of the Bennett family house that appears in the pilot episode is located at 5611 Shenandoah Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90056, USA According to the California Film Commission, the first season of Euphoria received $8,378,000 in incentive tax credits The first season was filmed over a combined total of 104 days; the second season's production costs totaled $96,685,000 after a total of 176 filming days Subsequently, the second season received a $19,406,000 tax credit for employing over 15,000 people in California [80] Zendaya received $500,000 per episode in the first two seasons and will receive $1,000,000 per episode in the third season [81] [82] [83]\n\n\nVisual style\nThe visual style of Euphoria is heavily inspired by the work of Petra Collins.\nEuphoria employs hyper-stylized cinematography, set design, costume design, and editing, which presents an \"emotional realism\" that captures the inner perspectives of the series's adolescent characters [88] [89] [90] The first season was shot digitally using the Arri Alexa 65 camera [91] The two special episodes and second season were shot on Kodak 35mm film stock, primarily Ektachrome, which cinematographer Marcell Rév attributed to a desire to invoke \"some sort of memory of high school\" [92]\n\n\nUse of color and lighting\nThe series often utilizes saturated colors, notably of purple and blue, to communicate the emotional state of its characters Shades of green and yellow regularly symbolize distress, while purple and blue convey an elated, feverish atmosphere [90] In shooting both day and night exteriors, cinematographer Marcell Rév relied on an exaggerated orange-blue color scheme, translated in the use of backlights and tungsten lights, to create visuals that feel \"almost dreamlike\" LED lights and SkyPanels were used in several interior shoots to display bright and vivid colors of purple and blue [93] The second season of Euphoria was shot on film, specifically in Kodak's Ektachrome and Vision3 500T, which distorted how set lighting looked on camera [93] [94]\n\n\nCamera movement\n\"For camera movements, we really wanted it to have a certain energy that ties the different storylines together So, I would say the camera movement is the glue in the show, that glues it together\" said Rév on using an energized design element that stands out [88] Extensive whip pans and tracking shots were employed to portray intimacy, growth, and interrelationship In the fourth episode of first season \"Shook Ones Pt II\", a 2-minute tracking shot, achieved  through the use of a dolly, a technocrane, and four camera stitches, was \"to introduce a space where all  [the] characters were present, and somehow connect them in one shot\" [88] [93]\n\n\nCostume design\nThe costume design of Euphoria is arguably the series' most notable and influential hallmark [95] [96] The characters of the series are regularly shown in chic, flamboyant outfits that serve as \"plot devices and psychological profiles\" to represent their personalities and character arcs For example, in the first season, costume designer Heidi Bivens dressed Jules, a transgender woman, in a wardrobe consisting of bright pastels and tennis skirts, inspired by the character's interest in anime and fantasy, to embody \"the youthful optimism that comes with a fresh start\" and her journey to \"conquer\" femininity, but as the character explores her gender identity and becomes more disillusioned between the first and second seasons, she \"slips into a slightly muted, darker and more androgynous\" wardrobe [97]\n\n\nAnalysis\nThe visual aesthetics of Euphoria has been compared to the German expressionism movement of the early 20th century [98]\n\n\nMusic\nEuphoria's score was composed by English singer, songwriter, and record producer Labrinth [99] The song \"All for Us\", performed by Labrinth and Zendaya, is hinted at throughout season 1 before being performed as a large musical number at the end of the season finale [100] Labrinth makes an appearance in the series alongside Zendaya to perform their song \"I'm Tired\" [101]\n\n\nScores\nThe score album for the first season was released by Sony Masterworks through Milan Records on October 4, 2019, for digital download [106] The album was also released on vinyl on January 10, 2020 [107] The score has been described as \"the holy lilt of gospel, orchestral and electronic\" and was favorably reviewed by Variety [108]\n\n\nSoundtracks\nA soundtrack album featuring a selection of songs from the first season and specials was released by Interscope Records digitally on May 14, 2021, with vinyl copies released on September 3, 2021 [110]\n\n\nSeason 1 soundtrack\nA soundtrack album featuring a selection of songs from the first season and specials was released by Interscope Records digitally on May 14, 2021,

2022, and vinyl on July 29, 2022 [113] [114] [115] The album's release was preceded by seven singles, \"Watercolor Eyes\" by Lana Del Rey, \"How Long\" by Tove Lo, \"(Pick Me Up) Euphoria\" by James Blake featuring Labrinth, \"Sad4Whattt\" by EricDoa, \"Yeh I Fuckin' Did it\" by Labrinth, \"I'm Tired\" by Labrinth and Zendaya, and \"Elliot's Song\" by Dominic Fike and Zendaya [116] [117] [118] [119] [120]\n\n\nEpisode titles\nMany of the episode titles for season one are references to late-1990s and early-2000s song titles that correlate to the episode itself For instance, \"'03 Bonnie and Clyde\" is a reference to the 2002 Jay-Z and Beyoncé song of the same name The loyal relationship between Nate Jacobs and Maddy Perez in the episode mirrors that between Jay-Z and Beyoncé in the song [122] [9]\n\n\nRelease\nThe series premiered on June 16, 2019, on HBO In Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, it premiered on June 17, 2019, through HBO Asia [123] In Australia, it premiered on June

Leshem, Levin, Yardeni, Hadas Mozes Lichtenstein, Mirit Toovi, Yoram Mokadi, Gary Lennon, Zendaya, Canadian rapper Drake, Future the Prince, Ravi Nandan, and Kevin Turen [36] [38] [39] The pilot episode was directed by Augustine Frizzell [40]\n\n\nCasting\nIn June 2018, it was announced that the pilot would star Zendaya, Storm Reid, Maude Apatow, Astro, Eric Dane, Angus Cloud, Alexa Demie, Jacob Elordi, Barbie Ferreira, Nika King, Hunter Schafer, and Sydney Sweeney [70] In October, Algee Smith was cast to replace Astro as McKay, and Austin Abrams had also been cast [71] Astro reportedly quit the series after shooting the pilot as he was uncomfortable with the sexual content involving his character [72]\n\n\nFilming\nPrimary photography takes place in Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California Grant High School in Los Angeles stands in for the fictional East Highland High School [79] The exterior of the Bennett family house that appears in the pilot episode is located at 5611 Shenandoah Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90056, USA According to the California Film Commission, the first season of Euphoria received $8,378,000 in incentive tax credits The first season was filmed over a combined total of 104 days; the second season's production costs totaled $96,685,000 after a total of 176 filming days Subsequently, the second season received a $19,406,000 tax credit for employing

visual style of Euphoria is heavily inspired by the work of Petra Collins.\nEuphoria employs hyper-stylized cinematography, set design, costume design, and editing, which presents an \"emotional realism\" that captures the inner perspectives of the series's adolescent characters [88] [89] [90] The first season was shot digitally using the Arri Alexa 65 camera [91] The two special episodes and second season were shot on Kodak 35mm film stock, primarily Ektachrome, which cinematographer Marcell Rév attributed to a desire to invoke \"some sort of memory of high school\" [92]\n\n\nUse of color and lighting\nThe series often utilizes saturated colors, notably of purple and blue, to communicate the emotional state of its characters Shades of green and yellow regularly symbolize distress, while purple and blue convey an elated, feverish atmosphere [90] In shooting both day and night exteriors, cinematographer Marcell Rév relied on an exaggerated orange-blue color scheme, translated in the use of backlights and tungsten lights, to create visuals that feel \"almost dreamlike\" LED lights and SkyPanels were used in several interior shoots to display bright and vivid colors of purple and blue [93] The second season of Euphoria was shot on film, specifically in Kodak's Ektachrome and Vision3 500T, which distorted how set lighting looked on camera [93] [94]\n\n\nCamera movement\n\"For camera movements, we really wanted it to have a certain energy that ties the different storylines together So, I would say the camera movement is the glue in the show, that glues it together\" said Rév on using an energized design element that stands out [88] Extensive whip pans and tracking shots were employed to portray intimacy, growth, and interrelationship In the fourth episode of first season \"Shook Ones Pt II\", a 2-minute tracking shot, achieved  through the use of a dolly, a technocrane, and four camera stitches, was \"to introduce a space where all  [the] characters were present, and somehow connect them in one shot\" [88] [93]\n\n\nCostume design\nThe costume design of Euphoria is arguably the series' most notable and influential hallmark [95] [96] The characters of the series are regularly shown in chic, flamboyant outfits that serve as \"plot devices and psychological profiles\" to represent their personalities and character arcs For example, in the first season, costume designer Heidi Bivens dressed Jules, a transgender woman, in a wardrobe consisting of bright pastels and tennis skirts, inspired by the character's interest in anime and fantasy, to embody \"the youthful optimism that comes with a fresh start\" and her journey to \"conquer\" femininity, but as the character explores her gender identity and becomes more disillusioned between the first and second seasons, she \"slips into a slightly muted, darker and more androgynous\" wardrobe [97]\n\n\nAnalysis\nThe visual aesthetics of Euphoria has been compared to the German expressionism movement of the early 20th century [98]\n\n\nMusic\nEuphoria's score was composed by English singer, songwriter, and record producer Labrinth [99] The song \"All for Us\", performed by Labrinth and Zendaya, is hinted at throughout season 1 before being performed as a large musical number at the end of the season finale [100] Labrinth makes an appearance in the series alongside Zendaya to perform their song \"I'm Tired\" [101]\n\n\nScores\nThe score album for the first season was released by Sony Masterworks through Milan Records on October 4, 2019, for digital download [106] The album was also released on vinyl on January 10, 2020 [107] The score has been described as \"the holy lilt of gospel, orchestral and electronic\" and was favorably reviewed by Variety [108]\n\n\nSoundtracks\nA soundtrack album featuring a selection of songs from the first season and specials was released by Interscope Records digitally on May 14, 2021, with vinyl copies released on

[119] [120]\n\n\nEpisode titles\nMany of the episode titles for season one are references to late-1990s and early-2000s song titles that correlate to the episode itself For instance, \"'03 Bonnie and Clyde\" is a reference to the 2002 Jay-Z and Beyoncé song of the same name The loyal relationship between Nate Jacobs and Maddy Perez in the episode mirrors that between Jay-Z and Beyoncé in the song

he would take her on the road with him, during his \"gospel caravan\" tours for her to perform in various churches [30] He also helped her sign her first recording deal with J.V.B Records Franklin was featured on vocals and piano [31] In 1956, J.V.B released Franklin's first single, \"Never Grow Old\", backed with \"You Grow Closer\" \"Precious Lord (Part One)\" backed with \"Precious Lord (Part Two)\" followed in 1959 These four tracks, with the addition of \"There Is a Fountain Filled with Blood\", were released on side one of the 1956 album, Spirituals This was reissued by Battle Records in 1962, under the same title [32] In 1965, Checker Records released Songs of Faith, featuring the five tracks from the 1956 Spirituals album, with the addition of four previously unreleased recordings Aretha was only 14 when Songs of Faith was recorded [33]\n\n\n1952–1960: Beginnings\nJust after her mother's death, Franklin began singing solos at New Bethel Baptist Church, debuting with the hymn \"Jesus, Be a Fence Around Me\" [19] [29] When Franklin was 12, her father began managing her;

at that time, she owed the company money because record sales had not met expectations [54] Producer Jerry Wexler convinced her to move to Atlantic Records [55] [56] Wexler decided that he wanted to take advantage of her gospel background; his philosophy in general was to encourage a \"tenacious form of rhythm & blues that became increasingly identified as soul\" [41] The Atlantic days would lead to a series of hits for Aretha Franklin from 1967 to early 1972; her rapport with Wexler helped in the creation of the majority of her peak recordings with Atlantic The next seven years' achievements were less impressive However, according to Rolling Stone, \"they weren't as terrible as some claimed, they were pro forma and never reached for new heights\" [57]\n\n\n1980–2007: Arista years\nIn 1980, after leaving Atlantic Records, [81] Franklin signed with Clive Davis's Arista Records [82] \"Davis was beguiling and had the golden touch\", according to Rolling Stone \"If anybody could rejuvenate Franklin's puzzlingly stuck career, it was Davis.\" [41] Also in 1980, Franklin gave a command performance at London's Royal Albert Hall in front of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Franklin also had an acclaimed guest role as a soul food restaurant proprietor and wife of Matt \"Guitar\" Murphy in the 1980 comedy musical The Blues Brothers [83] [84] Franklin's first Arista album, Aretha (1980), featured the number-three R&B hit \"United Together\" and her Grammy-nominated cover of Redding's \"I Can't Turn You Loose\" The follow-up, 1981's Love All the Hurt Away, included her famed duet of the title track with George Benson, while the album also included her Grammy-winning cover of Sam & Dave's \"Hold On, I'm Comin'\" Franklin achieved a gold record—for the first time in seven years—with the 1982 album Jump to It The album's title track was her first top-40 single on the pop charts in six years [85] The following year, she released \"Get It Right\", produced by Luther Vandross [86]\n\n\n2007–2018: Final years\nIn 2008, Franklin issued the holiday album This Christmas, Aretha on DMI Records [100] On February 8, 2008, Franklin was honored as the MusiCares Person of the Year, and performed \"Never Gonna Break My Faith\", which had won her the Grammy for best Gospel performance [101] the year before Twelve years later, an unheard performance of \"Never Gonna Break My Faith\" was released in June 2020 to commemorate Juneteenth with a new video visualizing the American human rights movement This caused the song to enter the Billboard gospel charts at number one, giving Franklin the distinction of having had a number one record in every decade since the 1960s On November 18, 2008, she performed \"Respect\" and \"Chain of Fools\" at Dancing with the Stars.\n\n\nMusic style and image\n\nAccording to Richie Unterberger, Franklin was \"one of the giants of soul music, and indeed of American pop as a whole More than any other performer, she epitomized soul at its most gospel-charged\" [1] She had often been described as a great singer and musician due to \"vocal flexibility, interpretive intelligence, skillful piano-playing, her ear, her experience\" [118] Franklin's voice was described as being a \"powerful mezzo-soprano voice\" She was praised for her arrangements and interpretations of other artists' hit songs [119] According to David Remnick, what \"distinguishes her is not merely the breadth of her catalog or the cataract force of her vocal instrument;

Franklin was known as the \"Queen of Soul\" for her powerful and soulful voice, as well as her impact on the music industry. She was one of the most successful and influential musicians of all time, with a career spanning over five decades.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nAretha Franklin was born on March 25, 1942, in Memphis, Tennessee, to Barbara (née Siggers) and Clarence LaVaughn \"C L.\" Franklin. Her father was a Baptist minister and circuit preacher originally from Shelby, Mississippi, while her mother was an accomplished piano player and vocalist. Both Mr. and Mrs. Franklin had children from prior relationships, in addition to the four children they had together. When Aretha was two, the family relocated to Buffalo, New York. By the time Aretha turned five, C L Franklin had permanently relocated the family to Detroit, Michigan, where he took over the pastorship of the New Bethel Baptist Church.\n\n**Musical Career**\n\nJust after her mother's death, Franklin began singing solos at New Bethel Baptist Church, debuting with the hymn \"Jesus, Be a Fence Around Me.\" When Franklin was 12, her father began managing her; he would take her on the road with him, during his \"gospel caravan\" tours, for her to perform in various churches. He also helped her sign her first recording deal with J.V.B Records, where Franklin was featured on vocals and piano. In 1956, J.V.B released Franklin's first single, \"Never Grow Old,\" backed with \"You Grow Closer.\" \"Precious Lord (Part One)\" backed with \"Precious Lord (Part Two)\" followed in 1959. These four tracks, with the addition of \"There Is a Fountain Filled with Blood,\" were released on side one of the 1956 album, Spirituals. This was reissued by Battle Records in 1962, under the same title. In 1965, Checker Records released Songs of Faith, featuring the five tracks from the 1956 Spirituals album, with the addition of four previously unreleased recordings. Aretha was only 14 when Songs of Faith was recorded.\n\n**1952–1960: Beginnings**\n\nJust after her mother's death, Franklin began singing solos at New Bethel Baptist Church, debuting with the hymn \"Jesus, Be a Fence Around Me.\" When Franklin was 12, her father began managing her; he would take her on the road with him, during his \"gospel caravan\" tours, for her to perform in various churches. He also helped her sign her first recording deal with J.V.B Records, where Franklin was featured on vocals and piano. In 1956, J.V.B released Franklin's first single, \"Never Grow Old,\" backed with \"You Grow Closer.\" \"Precious Lord (Part One)\" backed with \"Precious Lord (Part Two)\" followed in 1959. These four tracks, with the addition of \"There Is a Fountain Filled with Blood,\" were released on side one of the 1956 album, Spirituals. This was reissued by Battle Records in 1962, under the same title. In 1965, Checker Records released Songs of Faith, featuring the five tracks from the 1956 Spirituals album, with the addition of four previously unreleased recordings. Aretha was only 14 when Songs of Faith was recorded.\n\n**1960–1966: Columbia Years**\n\nAfter turning 18, Franklin confided to her father that she aspired to follow Sam Cooke in recording pop music, and moved to New York. Serving as her manager, C L Franklin agreed to the move and helped to produce a two-song demo that soon was brought to the attention of Columbia Records, who agreed to sign her in 1960, as a \"five-percent artist.\" During this period, Franklin would be coached by choreographer Cholly Atkins to prepare for her pop performances. Before signing with Columbia, Sam Cooke tried to persuade Franklin's father to sign her with his label, RCA Victor, but she had already decided to go with Columbia. Berry Gordy had also asked Franklin and her elder sister Erma to sign with his Tamla label, but C L Franklin turned Gordy down, as he felt Tamla was not yet an established label. Franklin's first Columbia single, \"Today I Sing the Blues,\" was issued in September 1960 and later reached the top 10 of the Hot Rhythm & Blues Sellers chart.\n\n**1966–1979: Atlantic Years**\n\nIn November 1966, Franklin's Columbia recording contract expired; at that time, she owed the company money because record sales had not met expectations. Producer Jerry Wexler convinced her to move to Atlantic Records. Wexler decided that he wanted to take advantage of her gospel background; his philosophy in general was to encourage a \"tenacious form of rhythm & blues that became increasingly identified as soul.\" The Atlantic days would lead to a series of hits for Aretha Franklin from 1967 to early 1972; her rapport with Wexler helped in the creation of the majority of her peak recordings with Atlantic. The next seven years' achievements were less impressive; however, according to Rolling Stone, \"they weren't as terrible as some claimed, they were pro forma and never reached for new heights.\"\n\n**1980–2007: Arista Years**\n\nIn 1980, after leaving Atlantic Records, Franklin signed with Clive Davis's Arista Records. \"Davis was beguiling and had the golden touch,\" according to Rolling Stone. \"If anybody could rejuvenate Franklin's puzzlingly stuck career, it was Davis.\" Also in 1980, Franklin gave a command performance at London's Royal Albert Hall in front of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Franklin also had an acclaimed guest role as a soul food restaurant proprietor and wife of Matt \"Guitar\" Murphy in the 1980 comedy musical The Blues Brothers. Franklin's first Arista album, Aretha (1980), featured the number-three R&B hit \"United Together\" and her Grammy-nominated cover of Redding's \"I Can't Turn You Loose.\" The follow-up, 1981's Love All the Hurt Away, included her famed duet of the title track with George Benson, while the album also included her Grammy-winning cover of Sam & Dave's \"Hold On, I'm Comin'.\" Franklin achieved a gold record—for the first time in seven years—with the 1982 album Jump to It. The album's title track was her first top-40 single on the pop charts in six years. The following year, she released \"Get It Right,\" produced by Luther Vandross.\n\n**2007–2018: Final Years**\n\nIn 2008, Franklin issued the holiday album This Christmas, Aretha on DMI Records. On February 8, 2008, Franklin was honored as the MusiCares Person of the Year, and performed \"Never Gonna Break My Faith,\" which had won her the Grammy for best Gospel performance the year before. Twelve years later, an unheard performance of \"Never Gonna Break My Faith\" was released in June 2020 to commemorate Juneteenth with a new video visualizing the American human rights movement. This caused the song to enter the Billboard gospel charts at number one, giving Franklin the distinction of having had a number one record in every decade since the 1960s. On November 18, 2008, she performed \"Respect\" and \"Chain of Fools\" at Dancing with the Stars.\n\n**Music Style and Image**\n\nAccording to Richie Unterberger, Franklin was \"one of the giants of soul music, and indeed of American pop as a whole. More than any other performer, she epitomized soul at its most gospel-charged.\" She had often been described as a great singer and musician due to \"vocal flexibility, interpretive intelligence, skillful piano-playing, her ear, her experience.\" Franklin's voice was described as being a \"powerful mezzo-soprano voice.\" She was praised for her arrangements and interpretations of other artists' hit songs. According to David Remnick, what \"distinguishes her is not merely the breadth of her catalog or the cataract force of her vocal instrument; it's her musical intelligence, her way of singing behind the beat, of spraying a wash of notes over a single word or syllable, of constructing, moment by moment, the emotional power of a three-minute song. 'Respect' is as precise an artifact as a Ming vase.\" Describing Franklin's voice on her first album, Songs of Faith, released in 1956 when she was just 14, Jerry Wexler explained that it \"was not that of a child but rather of an ecstatic hierophant.\" Critic Randy Lewis assessed her skills as a pianist as \"magic\" and \"inspirational.\" Musicians and professionals alike, such as Elton John, Keith Richards, Carole King, and Clive Davis, were fans of her piano performances.\n\n**Activism**\n\nFrom her time growing up in the home of a prominent African-American preacher to the end of her life, Franklin was immersed and involved in the struggle for civil rights and women's rights. She provided money for civil rights groups, at times covering payroll, and performed at benefits and protests. When Angela Davis was jailed in 1970, Franklin told Jet: \"Angela Davis must go free... Black people will be free. I've been locked up (for disturbing the peace in Detroit) and I know you got to disturb the peace when you can't get no peace. Jail is hell to be in. I'm going to see her free if there is any justice in our courts, not because I believe in communism, but because she's a Black woman and she wants freedom for Black people.\" Her songs \"Respect\" and \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\" became anthems of these movements for social change. Franklin and several other American icons declined to take part in performing at President Donald Trump's 2017 inauguration as a mass act of musical protest. Franklin was also a strong supporter of Native American rights. She quietly and without fanfare supported Indigenous peoples' struggles worldwide, and numerous movements that supported Native American and First Nation cultural rights.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nFranklin moved to New York City from Detroit in the 1960s where she lived until relocating to Los Angeles in the mid-1970s. She eventually settled in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Encino, where she lived until 1982. She then returned to the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills to be close to her ailing father and siblings. Franklin maintained a residence there until her death. Following an incident in 1984, she cited a fear of flying that prevented her from traveling overseas; she performed only in North America afterwards. Franklin was Baptist.\n\n**Health**\n\nFranklin had weight issues for many years. In 1974, she lost 40 pounds (18 kg) on a very-low-calorie diet and maintained her new weight until the end of the decade. She again lost weight in the early 1990s, before gaining some back. A former chain smoker who struggled with alcoholism, she quit smoking in 1992. She admitted in 1994 that her smoking was \"messing with my voice,\" but after quitting smoking, she said later, in 2003, that her weight \"ballooned.\"\n\n**Death and Funeral**\n\nOn August 13, 2018, Franklin was reported to be gravely ill at her home in Riverfront Towers, Detroit. She was under hospice care and surrounded by friends and family. Stevie Wonder, Jesse Jackson, and former husband Glynn Turman visited her on her deathbed. Franklin died at her home on August 16, 2018, aged 76. She was initially thought to have died without a will. The cause of death was a malignant pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET), which is distinct from the most common form of pancreatic cancer. Numerous celebrities in the entertainment industry and politicians paid tribute to Franklin, including former U.S. President Barack Obama, who said she \"helped define the American experience.\" Civil rights activist and minister Al Sharpton called her a \"civil rights and humanitarian icon.\"\n\n**Legacy and Honors**\n\nFranklin received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1979, had her voice declared a Michigan \"natural resource\" in 1985, and became the first woman inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences awarded her a Grammy Legend Award in 1991, then the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994. Franklin was a Kennedy Center Honoree in 1994, recipient of the National Medal of Arts in 1999, recipient of the American Academy of Achievement's Golden Plate Award presented by Awards Council member Coretta Scott King, and was bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005 by then President George W. Bush. She was inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame in 2005, and the Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame in 2015. Franklin became the second woman inducted to the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. She was the 2008 MusiCares Person of the Year, performing at the Grammys days later. In 2019, she was awarded a Pulitzer Prize Special Citation \"for her indelible contribution to American music and culture for more than five decades.\" Franklin was the first individual woman to receive a Pulitzer Prize Special Citation. At the beginning of her career, Siouxsie Sioux named her as her favorite female singer.\n\n**Honorary Degrees**\n\nFranklin received honorary degrees from Harvard University and New York University in 2014, as well as honorary doctorates in music from Princeton University, 2012; Yale University, 2010; Brown University, 2009; the University of Pennsylvania, 2007; Berklee College of Music, 2006; the New England Conservatory of Music, 1997; and the University of Michigan, 1987. She was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters by Case Western Reserve University in 2011 and Wayne State University in 1990, and an honorary Doctor of Law degree by Bethune–Cookman University in 1975.\n\n**Tributes**\n\nAfter Franklin's death, fans added unofficial tributes to two New York City Subway stations: the Franklin Street station in Manhattan, served by the 1 train, and the Franklin Avenue station in Brooklyn, served by the C and S trains. Both stations were originally named after other people. Although the fan tributes were later taken down, the subway system's operator, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, placed permanent black-and-white stickers with the word \"Respect\" next to the \"Franklin\" name signs in each station.\n\n**Portrayals in Media**\n\nOn January 29, 2018, Gary Graff confirmed that Jennifer Hudson would play Franklin in an upcoming biopic. Franklin's biopic Respect was released in August 2021 in various countries. On February 10, 2019, it was announced that the subject of the third season of the American National Geographic anthology television series Genius would be Franklin, in the \"first-ever, definitive scripted miniseries on the life of the universally acclaimed Queen of Soul.\" The season, starring Cynthia Erivo as Franklin, was aired in March 2021. However, Franklin's family denounced the series, claiming to be uninvolved with the production process, despite the production team stating that the series had been endorsed by the Franklin estate.\n\n**Discography**\n\nStudio albums:\n\n* 1963: The Electrifying Aretha Franklin (Columbia Records)\n* 1965: The Tender, the Moving, the Swinging Aretha Franklin (Columbia Records)\n* 1967: I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (Atlantic Records)\n* 1967: Are You Ready (Atlantic Records)\n* 1968: Soul Sister (Atlantic Records)\n* 1968: Lady Soul (Atlantic Records)\n* 1969: Aretha Now (Atlantic Records)\n* 1969: Soul '69 (Atlantic Records)\n* 1970: This Girl's in Love with You (Atlantic Records)\n* 1971: Spirit in the Dark (Atlantic Records)\n* 1972: Young, Gifted and Black (Atlantic Records)\n* 1973: Amazing Grace (Atlantic Records)\n* 1974: Let Me in Your Life (Atlantic Records)\n* 1974: With Everything I Feel in Me (Atlantic Records)\n* 1975: You (Atlantic Records)\n* 1976: Sparkle (Atlantic Records)\n* 1977: Sweet Passion (Arista Records)\n* 1978: Almighty Fire (Arista Records)\n* 1979: La Diva (Arista Records)\n* 1980: Aretha (Arista Records)\n* 1981: Love All the Hurt Away (Arista Records)\n* 1982: Jump to It (Arista Records)\n* 1983: Get It Right (Arista Records)\n* 1985: Who's Zoomin' Who?

her rapport with Wexler helped in the creation of the majority of her peak recordings with Atlantic The next seven years' achievements were less impressive However, according to Rolling Stone, \"they weren't as terrible as some claimed, they were pro forma and never reached for new heights\" [57]\n\n\n1980–2007: Arista years\nIn 1980, after leaving Atlantic Records, [81] Franklin signed with Clive Davis's Arista Records [82] \"Davis was beguiling and had the golden touch\", according to Rolling Stone \"If anybody could rejuvenate Franklin's puzzlingly stuck career, it was Davis.\" [41] Also in 1980, Franklin gave a command performance at London's Royal Albert Hall in front of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Franklin also had an acclaimed guest role as a soul food restaurant proprietor and wife of Matt \"Guitar\" Murphy in the 1980 comedy musical The Blues Brothers [83] [84] Franklin's first Arista album, Aretha (1980), featured the number-three R&B hit \"United Together\" and her Grammy-nominated cover of Redding's \"I Can't Turn You Loose\" The follow-up, 1981's Love All the Hurt Away, included her famed duet of the title track with George Benson, while the album also included her Grammy-winning cover of Sam & Dave's \"Hold On, I'm Comin'\" Franklin achieved a gold record—for the first time in seven years—with the 1982 album Jump to It The album's title track was her first top-40 single on the pop charts in six years [85] The following year, she released \"Get It Right\", produced by Luther Vandross [86]\n\n\n2007–2018: Final years\nIn 2008, Franklin issued the holiday album This Christmas, Aretha on DMI Records [100] On February 8, 2008, Franklin was honored as the MusiCares Person of the Year, and performed \"Never Gonna Break My Faith\", which had won her the Grammy for best Gospel performance [101] the year before Twelve years later, an unheard performance of \"Never Gonna Break My Faith\" was released in June 2020 to commemorate Juneteenth with a new video visualizing the American human rights movement This caused the song to enter the Billboard gospel charts at number one, giving Franklin the distinction of having had a number one record in every decade since the 1960s On November 18, 2008, she performed \"Respect\" and \"Chain of Fools\" at Dancing with the Stars.\n\n\nMusic style and image\n\nAccording to Richie Unterberger, Franklin was \"one of the giants of soul music, and indeed of American pop as a whole More than any other performer, she epitomized soul at its most gospel-charged\" [1] She had often been described as a great singer and musician due to \"vocal flexibility, interpretive intelligence, skillful piano-playing, her ear, her experience\" [118] Franklin's voice was described as being a \"powerful mezzo-soprano voice\" She was praised for her arrangements and interpretations of other artists' hit songs [119] According to David Remnick, what \"distinguishes her is not merely the breadth of her catalog or the cataract force of her vocal instrument; it's her musical intelligence, her way of singing behind the beat, of spraying a wash of notes over a single word or syllable, of constructing, moment by moment, the emotional power of a three-minute song 'Respect' is as precise an artifact as a Ming vase.\" [109] Describing Franklin's voice on her first album, Songs of Faith, released in 1956 when she was just 14, Jerry Wexler explained that it \"was not that of a child but rather of an ecstatic hierophant\" [120] Critic Randy Lewis assessed her skills as a pianist as \"magic\" and \"inspirational\" Musicians and professionals alike such as Elton John, Keith Richards, Carole King, and Clive Davis were fans of her piano performances [121] In 2015, President Barack Obama wrote the following regarding Franklin:\n\nActivism\nFrom her time growing up in the home of a prominent African-American preacher to the end of her life, Franklin was immersed and involved in the struggle for civil rights and women's rights She provided money for civil rights groups, at times covering payroll, and performed at benefits and protests [123] When Angela Davis was jailed in 1970, Franklin told Jet: \"Angela Davis must go free .. Black people will be free I've been locked up (for disturbing the peace in Detroit) and I know you got to disturb the peace when you can't get no peace Jail is hell to be in I'm going to see her free if there is any justice in our courts, not because I believe in communism, but because she's a Black woman and she wants freedom for Black people.\" [123] Her songs \"Respect\" and \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\" became anthems of these movements for social change [124] [125] Franklin and several other American icons declined to take part in performing at President Donald Trump's 2017 inauguration as a mass act of musical protest [126] Franklin was also a strong supporter of Native American rights [127] She quietly and without fanfare supported Indigenous peoples' struggles worldwide, and numerous movements that supported Native American and First Nation cultural rights [127]\n\n\nPersonal life\nFranklin moved to New York City from Detroit in the 1960s where she lived until relocating to Los Angeles in the mid-1970s She eventually settled in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Encino, where she lived until 1982 She then returned to the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills to be close to her ailing father and siblings Franklin maintained a residence there until her death Following an incident in 1984, she cited a fear of flying that prevented her from traveling overseas; she performed only in North America afterwards [52] Franklin was Baptist [128]\n\n\nHealth\nFranklin had weight issues for many years In 1974, she lost 40 pounds (18 kg) on a very-low-calorie diet [156] and maintained her new weight until the end of the decade [157] She again lost weight in the early 1990s, before gaining some back [158] A former chain smoker who struggled with alcoholism, she quit smoking in 1992 [159] She admitted in 1994 that her smoking was \"messing with my voice\", [160] but after quitting smoking she said later, in 2003, that her weight \"ballooned\" [161]\n\n\nDeath and funeral\nOn August 13, 2018, Franklin was reported to be gravely ill at her home in Riverfront Towers, Detroit [173] [174] She was under hospice care and surrounded by friends and family Stevie Wonder, Jesse Jackson and former husband Glynn Turman visited her on her deathbed [175] Franklin died at her home on August 16, 2018, aged 76 [176] She was initially thought to have died without a will [177] [178] The cause of death was a malignant pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET), [179] [180] which is distinct from the most common form of pancreatic cancer [181] [182] Numerous celebrities in the entertainment industry and politicians paid tribute to Franklin, including former U.S President Barack Obama who said she \"helped define the American experience\" [183] Civil rights activist and minister Al Sharpton called her a \"civil rights and humanitarian icon\" [184]\n\n\nLegacy and honors\nFranklin received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1979, had her voice declared a Michigan \"natural resource\" in 1985, [198] and became the first woman inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 [199] The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences awarded her a Grammy Legend Award in 1991, then the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994 Franklin was a Kennedy Center Honoree in 1994, recipient of the National Medal of Arts in 1999, recipient of the American Academy of Achievement's Golden Plate Award presented by Awards Council member Coretta Scott King, [200] [201] [202] and was bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005 by then President George W Bush [25] She was inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame in 2005, [203] and the Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame in 2015 [204] Franklin became the second woman inducted to the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005 She was the 2008 MusiCares Person of the Year, performing at the Grammys days later In 2019 she was awarded a Pulitzer Prize Special Citation \" [f]or her indelible contribution to American music and culture for more than five decades\" [205] Franklin was the first individual woman to receive a Pulitzer Prize Special Citation [206] At the beginning of her career, Siouxsie Sioux named her as her favourite female singer [207]\n\n\nHonorary degrees\nFranklin received honorary degrees from Harvard University and New York University in 2014, [221] as well as honorary doctorates in music from Princeton University, 2012;

Jallianwala Bagh massacre, also known as the Amritsar massacre, was a tragic event that occurred on April 13, 1919, in Amritsar, Punjab, India. It was a brutal suppression of a peaceful gathering of Indian nationalists, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people and left many more injured.\n\n**Background**\n\nDuring World War I, British India contributed significantly to the British war effort by providing men and resources. Millions of Indian soldiers and laborers served in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, while both the Indian administration and the princes sent large supplies of food, money, and ammunition. Bengal and Punjab remained sources of anti-colonial activities, with revolutionary attacks in Bengal associated increasingly with disturbances in Punjab. The British Indian Army was also involved in several plots to overthrow British rule, which were planned between 1914 and 1917 by Indian nationalists in India, the United States, and Germany.\n\n**Defence of India Act**\n\nThe Defence of India Act was a law passed by the British government in 1915, which gave the government the power to detain and deport individuals suspected of being a threat to national security. This law was used to suppress anti-colonial activities and to restrict the movement of Indian nationalists.\n\n**The Rowlatt Act**\n\nThe Rowlatt Act was another law passed by the British government in 1919, which gave the government the power to detain and deport individuals suspected of being a threat to national security without trial. This law was widely opposed by Indian nationalists, who saw it as a further restriction on their civil liberties.\n\n**Before the Massacre**\n\nThe situation in Punjab was deteriorating rapidly in the weeks leading up to the massacre.

the film [16] [17] Burg and Koules said that Rock's treatment of Saw was comparable to what Eddie Murphy had done for buddy cop films in 48 Hrs., giving the Saw series a \"completely fresh perspective\" [5] Likewise, Bousman stated that in comparison to previous entries, Spiral included less violence and gore, expressing the conviction that the gore and violence were the gimmick for him back when he started working in the Saw films, but that both elements now serve the story, which focuses more on character, tension and fear [18] Stolberg also confirmed that the ninth installment

Jewish, some avenues were shut to you,\" and that \"hurt me and my brother a great deal.\" [118] Newman deflected the pain with humor, sometimes doing Yiddish voices \"for laughs.\" He was excluded from a high school fraternity because he was Jewish, and got into a \"bloody fight\" in the Navy because a sailor used an anti-Semitic slur [116] A family friend recounted that the \"stigma\" of being

[140] who was a liberal Republican, instead of the incumbent Democratic president, Jimmy Carter For Newman's support of Eugene McCarthy in 1968 (and effective use of television commercials in

Hotchner in 1982.\n\n**Early Life and Family**\n\nPaul Newman was born on January 26, 1925, in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. He was the second son of Theresa Garth and Arthur Sigmund Newman, Sr. Newman's father ran a sporting goods store, and the family later relocated to nearby Shaker Heights. Newman's early life was marked by a strong sense of identity, which would later influence his acting career. He attended Shaker Heights High School, where he was a member of the debate team and developed a passion for acting.\n\nNewman's family had a complex history, with his mother's family being of Slovak descent and his father's family being of Jewish descent.

He enrolled in the Navy V-12 pilot training program at Yale University but was dropped due to his colorblindness. Newman later recounted that his colorblindness was not the sole reason for his dismissal and that he had also struggled with the mathematical aspects of being a pilot. Boot camp followed, and Newman was trained as a radioman and rear gunner. He performed poorly as a gunner, and his friends from the service even lied to Navy trainers to help him pass.\n\nNewman's experience in the Navy had a profound impact on his life, particularly in regards to his sense of identity and his relationship with his heritage. He would later speak about the challenges he faced as a Jewish person in the Navy and how it influenced his acting career.\n\n**Education**\n\nAfter the war, Newman attended Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in drama and economics in 1949.

The film was a box-office smash, and Newman received his first Academy Award nomination.\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Newman became a household name, starring in iconic films such as \"The Hustler,\" \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\" and \"The Sting.\" He received numerous awards and nominations, including six Academy Award nominations and two wins. Newman's performances were characterized by his unique blend of charisma, wit, and vulnerability, which endeared him to audiences and critics alike.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nNewman was married twice, first to Jackie Witte from 1949 to 1958, with whom he had three children. His son, Scott, died of a drug overdose in 1978, and Newman established the Scott Newman Center for drug abuse prevention in his memory. Newman's second marriage was to Joanne Woodward, with whom he had two children and remained married until his death.\n\nNewman was a vocal supporter of various causes, including gay rights and same-sex marriage. He was also a longtime supporter of the Democratic Party and was placed 19th on Richard Nixon's enemies list in 1968 for his vocal opposition to the Vietnam War.\n\n**Illness and Death**\n\nNewman was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1998 and underwent treatment. He continued to act and direct until his death on September 26, 2008, at the age of 83.

helping to set up for Antonio's ceremony and is later heard informing Luisa that the donkeys got out again.\n\n\nProduction\nDuring a November 2016 publicity tour for Moana, Miranda revealed that early-stage work had begun on an animated project that John Lasseter, then the chief creative officer of Disney Animation, had presented to him and Howard [20] Howard and Bush subsequently revealed that after finishing Zootopia (2016), they knew they wanted their next project to be a musical [21]—which turned into a Latin-American musical after Miranda came on board [22] [23] Howard and Bush had already worked on buddy films \"where two characters go out into the world and learn about each other\" and wanted to try something \"completely different\" [23] The three men discussed their common experience of having large extended families, and decided to make a musical film about a large extended family with a dozen main characters [23] [24]\n\n\nDevelopment\nDuring a November 2016 publicity

The three men discussed their common experience of having large extended families, and decided to make a musical film about a large extended family with a dozen main characters [23] [24]\n\n\nWriting\nAs the film steadily became more complex, with an entire family to develop, multiple songs, and a rich cultural setting with a deep tradition of magical realism, Howard and Bush realized they needed a second screenwriter to help write the screenplay [23] They selected Charise Castro Smith for her strong background in magical realism and experience with handling \"real-world family dynamics\" [23] Bush described her as a \"godsend\", as she provided \"a foundation of heart, vulnerability and authenticity\" Castro Smith sought to create a distinct, imperfect, and completely human character in Mirabel, one that spoke to the lives of many Latinas while also being relatable to viewers globally [31]\n\n\nCasting\nDisney cast several actors with Colombian heritage, including Stephanie Beatriz, whose father is Colombian; John Leguizamo, who was born in Bogotá; and Wilmer Valderrama, who spent his childhood in Colombia, where his mother is from [33]\n\n\nDesign\nEncanto was the \"hardest film\" to date for heads of animation Renato dos Anjos and Kira Lehtomaki because they were asked to fully develop a dozen characters, as opposed to other animated films which primarily feature two or three characters out of a large cast [37] Accordingly, the characters required a degree of complexity that Disney Animation had previously never achieved [38] Journalist Edna Liliana Valencia Murillo was the Afro-Caribbean consultant and contributed greatly towards Félix, Dolores, and Antonio's designs [39] According to Howard, certain characters' Afro–Latin hairstyles were essential [40] Disney veterans Ian Gooding and Lorelay Bové were hired as production designers for the film Lorelay and her sister, costume design lead Neysa Bové, hoped to represent the film's various communities well Neysa requested Colombian consultants, which included an anthropologist and botanist [39]\n\n\nAnimation\nThe animators were challenged by the directors to make Mirabel distinctively different from all prior Disney heroines; she had to be both capable and imperfect, but not merely just clumsy [37] The Casita was inspired not only by traditional Colombian homes but films in which houses come alive, especially Beetlejuice (1988) [37]\n\n\nCinematography\nEncanto is the first Disney Animation film since Tangled (2010) to employ a tall frame, a decision made to \"get closer to the characters\" This layout was supplemented by romantic lighting [26]: 168  According to Howard, romantic (meaning heightened in spirit) is the film's key word in terms of the approach towards cinematography and lighting The latter was also inspired by magical realism, due to the genre's heavy influence on the writing and characters [40]\n\n\nSoundtrack\nIn June 2020, Miranda publicly revealed that he had begun to write the film's music, which would have eight original songs in both Spanish and English [48] After the film's premiere, he disclosed that he had been writing songs for the film from the very beginning [22] On September 8, 2021, Germaine Franco, co-composer of the songs for Coco (2017), began to score the film [49] [50]

internet users due to Luisa's physical appearance, especially her muscles; she was dubbed the \"Buff Lady\" [57] [58] The official trailer was released on September 29, 2021 [59] For its opening weekend at the box office, Disney spent $14 million on television advertisements to promote the film, generating 1.26 billion impressions Deadline Hollywood said the marketing failed to distinguish the film from other Disney properties, causing audience members to believe that it would be similar to Coco [60] /Film was critical of Disney's merchandising, most of which featured Mirabel and Isabela Many members of the Madrigal family could only be bought in more costly merchandise of the entire family Since Isabela is considered the perfect and beautiful sister, the website stated the merchandise reinforces the idea that beauty is the most effective marketing tactic for young girls [57]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe first look of the film was shown on December 10, 2020, during Disney's

musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios. The film is about the Madrigal family, who live in a magical house in Colombia. The story follows Mirabel, a young girl who is part of this family, as she discovers the secrets of her family's past and the true meaning of love and acceptance.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe story begins with the Madrigal family fleeing their home village in Colombia due to an armed conflict. During the journey, Pedro, the patriarch of the family, is killed, and Alma, the matriarch, discovers that the candle she carries has gained a magical power that repels the attackers and creates Casita, a sentient house. The family settles in a magical realm, where they live in harmony with nature.\n\nAs the years pass, the family's magical gifts begin to fade, and they struggle to maintain their connection to the house. Mirabel, who does not possess a magical gift, feels like an outcast and struggles to find her place within the family. When Bruno, the family's estranged uncle, returns to the family, Mirabel discovers that he has the ability to see into the future and understands the source of the family's problems.\n\n**Voice Cast**\n\nThe film features a talented voice cast, including Stephanie Beatriz as Mirabel, John Leguizamo as Bruno, and Wilmer Valderrama as Camilo. Other notable voice actors include Diane Guerrero as Isabela, Jessica Darrow as Luisa, and Rhenzy Feliz as Antonio.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe production of Encanto was a complex and challenging process. The film's directors, Jared Bush and Byron Howard, had to develop a dozen main characters, which was a task they had never undertaken before. The team also had to ensure that the characters' Afro-Latin hairstyles were accurate and authentic. The film's design team consulted with an anthropologist and a botanist to ensure that the film's depiction of Colombia was accurate and respectful.\n\n**Writing**\n\nCharise Castro Smith, a screenwriter with a background in magical realism, was brought in to help write the screenplay. Castro Smith sought to create a distinct and imperfect character in Mirabel, one that spoke to the lives of many Latinas while also being relatable to viewers globally.\n\n**Casting**\n\nDisney cast several actors with Colombian heritage, including Stephanie Beatriz, whose father is Colombian, and John Leguizamo, who was born in Bogotá. Wilmer Valderrama, who spent his childhood in Colombia, where his mother is from, also joined the cast.\n\n**Design**\n\nThe characters in Encanto required a degree of complexity that Disney Animation had previously never achieved. The team had to ensure that each character had their own unique personality and traits, while also fitting into the larger narrative. The film's design team consulted with an anthropologist and a botanist to ensure that the film's depiction of Colombia was accurate and respectful.\n\n**Animation**\n\nThe animators were challenged to make Mirabel distinctively different from all prior Disney heroines. She had to be both capable and imperfect, but not merely just clumsy. The Casita was inspired not only by traditional Colombian homes but also by films in which houses come alive, such as Beetlejuice.\n\n**Cinematography**\n\nEncanto is the first Disney Animation film since Tangled to employ a tall frame, a decision made to \"get closer to the characters.\" This layout was supplemented by romantic lighting, which added to the film's emotional depth.\n\n**Soundtrack**\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda wrote the film's music, which features eight original songs in both Spanish and English. The soundtrack was released in June 2020, and it quickly became a hit. Miranda has said that he was inspired by the film's magical realism and the way it celebrates the beauty of Colombia.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe first look of the film was shown on December 10, 2020, during Disney's Investor Day. The teaser trailer was released on July 8, 2021, and it quickly went viral. The official trailer was released on September 29, 2021, and it generated a lot of buzz.\n\n**Theatrical**\n\nDisney held the film's world premiere at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on November 3, 2021. The film was also shown at the Teatro Colón in Bogotá, Colombia, on November 23, 2021. Encanto was theatrically released in the United States on November 24, 2021.\n\n**Home Media**\n\nEncanto was released on Disney+ on December 24, 2021. The film was also released on DVD, Blu-ray, and Ultra HD Blu-ray on February 8, 2022. The bonus features include \"Let's Talk About Bruno,\" \"Our Casita,\" \"Journey to Colombia,\" \"Familia Lo Es Todo,\" \"A Journey Through Music,\" and a sing-along version of the movie.\n\n**Reception**\n\nEncanto grossed $96.1 million in the United States and Canada and $160.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $256.5 million. The film was 2021's highest-grossing animated film before it was surpassed by Sing 2. Encanto received nominations for Best Original Score and Best Original Song at the 94th Academy Awards and won Best Animated Feature. The film also won three awards at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\n**Impact and Response**\n\nThe Denver Post journalist John Wenzel wrote that Latino voices are having a moment in U.S. cinema, injecting a diverse set of cultures long ignored by TV, books, movies, video games, stage shows, and news media.

publicity tour for Moana, Miranda revealed that early-stage work had begun on an animated project that John Lasseter, then the chief creative officer of Disney Animation, had presented to him and Howard [20] Howard and Bush subsequently revealed that after finishing Zootopia (2016), they knew they wanted their next project to be a musical [21]—which turned into a Latin-American musical after Miranda came on board [22] [23] Howard and Bush had already worked on buddy films \"where two characters go out into the world and learn about each other\" and wanted to try something \"completely

family with a dozen main characters [23] [24]\n\n\nWriting\nAs the film steadily became more complex, with an entire family to develop, multiple songs, and a rich cultural setting with a deep tradition of magical realism, Howard and Bush realized they needed a second screenwriter to help write the screenplay [23] They selected Charise Castro Smith for her strong background in magical realism and experience with handling \"real-world family dynamics\" [23] Bush described her as a \"godsend\", as she provided \"a foundation of heart, vulnerability and authenticity\" Castro Smith sought to create a distinct, imperfect, and completely human character in Mirabel, one that spoke to the lives of many Latinas while also being relatable to viewers globally [31]\n\n\nCasting\nDisney cast several actors with Colombian heritage, including Stephanie Beatriz, whose father is Colombian; John Leguizamo, who was born in Bogotá; and Wilmer Valderrama, who spent his childhood in Colombia, where his mother is from [33]\n\n\nDesign\nEncanto was the \"hardest film\" to date for heads of animation Renato dos Anjos and Kira Lehtomaki because they were asked to fully develop a dozen characters, as opposed to other animated films which primarily feature two or three characters out of a large cast [37] Accordingly, the characters required a degree of complexity that Disney Animation had previously never achieved [38] Journalist Edna Liliana Valencia Murillo was the Afro-Caribbean consultant and contributed greatly towards Félix, Dolores, and Antonio's designs [39] According to Howard, certain characters' Afro–Latin hairstyles were essential [40] Disney veterans Ian Gooding and Lorelay Bové were hired as production designers for the film Lorelay and her sister, costume design lead Neysa Bové, hoped to represent the film's various communities well Neysa requested Colombian consultants, which included an anthropologist and botanist [39]\n\n\nAnimation\nThe animators were challenged by the directors to make Mirabel distinctively different from all prior Disney heroines; she had to be both capable and imperfect, but not merely just clumsy [37] The Casita was inspired not only by traditional Colombian homes but films in which houses come alive, especially Beetlejuice (1988) [37]\n\n\nCinematography\nEncanto is the first Disney Animation film since Tangled (2010) to employ a tall frame, a decision made to \"get closer to the characters\" This layout was supplemented by romantic lighting [26]: 168  According to Howard, romantic (meaning heightened in spirit) is the film's key word in terms of the approach towards cinematography and lighting The latter was also inspired by magical realism, due to the genre's heavy influence on the writing and characters [40]\n\n\nSoundtrack\nIn June 2020, Miranda publicly revealed that he had begun to write the film's music, which would have eight original songs in both Spanish and English [48] After the film's premiere, he disclosed that he had been writing songs for the film from the very beginning [22] On September 8, 2021, Germaine Franco, co-composer of the songs for Coco (2017), began

{"title": "1989_Tiananmen_Square_protests_and_massacre", "content": "\nNaming\nThe Chinese government has used numerous names for the event since 1989 [34] As the events unfolded, it was labeled a \"counter revolutionary rebellion\", which was later changed to simply \"riot\", followed by \"political turmoil\" and \"1989 storm\" [34]\n\n\nBackground\nThe Cultural Revolution ended with chairman Mao Zedong's death in 1976 and the arrest of the Gang of Four [38] [39] That movement, spearheaded by Mao, had caused severe damage to the country's initially diverse economic and social fabric [40] As a result, the country was now mired in poverty as economic production slowed or came to a halt [41] Political ideology was paramount in the lives of ordinary people as well as the inner workings of the party itself [42]\n\n\nBoluan Fanzheng and economic reforms\nThe Cultural Revolution ended with chairman Mao Zedong's death in 1976 and the arrest of the Gang of Four [38] [39] That movement, spearheaded by Mao, had caused severe damage to the country's initially diverse economic and social fabric [40] As a result, the country was now mired in poverty as economic production slowed or came to a halt [41] Political ideology was paramount in the lives of ordinary people as well as the inner workings of the party itself [42]\n\n\nChallenges to Reforms and Opening-up\nDeng's reforms aimed to decrease the state's role in the economy and gradually allow private production in agriculture and industry By 1981, roughly 73% of rural farms had been de-collectivized, and 80% of state-owned enterprises were permitted to retain their profits.\n\n\nSocial disenfranchisement and legitimacy crisis\nIn 1978, reformist leaders had envisioned that intellectuals would play a leading role in guiding the country through reforms, but this did not happen as planned [48] On one hand, the massive New Enlightenment movement led by intellectuals promoted a variety of liberal philosophies and values that challenged the socialist ideology, ranging from democracy, humanism, universal values such as freedom and human rights, to Total Westernization; [27] [49] as response, since the beginning of the reforms, Deng Xiaoping in 1979 proposed the \"Four Cardinal Principles\" to limit the political liberalization [50] On the other hand, despite the opening of new universities and increased enrollment, [51] the state-directed education system did not produce enough graduates to meet increased demand in the areas of agriculture, light industry, services, and foreign investment [52] The job market was especially limited for students specializing in social sciences and the humanities [51] Moreover, private companies no longer needed to accept students assigned to them by the state, and many high-paying jobs were offered based on nepotism and favoritism [53] Gaining a good state-assigned placement meant navigating a highly inefficient bureaucracy that gave power to officials who had little expertise in areas under their jurisdiction [47] Facing a dismal job market and limited chances of going abroad, intellectuals and students had a greater vested interest in political issues Small study groups, such as the \"Democracy Salon\" (Chinese: 民主沙龙; pinyin: Mínzhǔ Shālóng) and the \"Lawn Salon\" (草地沙龙; Cǎodì Shālóng), began appearing on Beijing university campuses [54] These organizations motivated the students to get involved politically [46]\n\n\n1986 student demonstrations\nIn mid-1986, astrophysics professor Fang Lizhi returned from a position at Princeton University and began a personal tour of universities in China, speaking about liberty, human rights, and the separation of powers Fang was part of a wide undercurrent within the elite intellectual community that thought China's poverty and underdevelopment, and the disaster of the Cultural Revolution, were a direct result of China's authoritarian political system and rigid command economy [57] The view that political reform was the only answer to China's ongoing problems gained widespread appeal among students, as Fang's recorded speeches became widely circulated throughout the country [58] In response, Deng Xiaoping warned that Fang was blindly worshipping Western lifestyles, capitalism, and multi-party systems while undermining China's socialist ideology, traditional values, and the party's leadership [58]\n\n\nPolitical reforms\nOn 18 August 1980, Deng Xiaoping gave a speech titled \"On the Reform of the Party and State Leadership System\" (\"党和国家领导制度改革\") at a full meeting of the CCP Politburo in Beijing, launching political reforms in China [62] [63] [64] He called for a systematic revision of China's constitution, criticizing bureaucracy, centralization of power, and patriarchy, while proposing term limits for the leading positions in China and advocating \"democratic centralism\" and \"collective leadership.\" [62] [63] [64] In December 1982, the fourth and current Constitution of China, known as the \"1982 Constitution\", was passed by the 5th National People's Congress [65] [66]\n\n\nFunding and support\nDuring the demonstrations, protesters received a significant amount of support from domestic and outside sources [77] The Chinese University in Hong Kong donated HK$10,000 by early May, [78]: 313  and groups such as the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China were founded in support of the protests Funding also came from the United States, Canada, Japan, Taiwan, Australia, and countries across Europe [79]\n\n\nBeginning of the 1989 protests\nWhen Hu Yaobang suddenly died of a heart attack on 15 April 1989, students reacted strongly, most of them believing that his death was related to his forced resignation [80] Hu's death provided the initial impetus for students to gather in large numbers [81] On university campuses, many posters appeared eulogizing Hu, calling for honoring Hu's legacy Within days, most posters were about broader political issues, such as corruption, democracy, and freedom of the press [82] Small, spontaneous gatherings to mourn Hu began on 15 April around the Monument to the People's Heroes at Tiananmen Square On the same day, many students at Peking University (PKU) and Tsinghua University erected shrines and joined the gathering in Tiananmen Square in a piecemeal fashion [clarification needed] Small, organized student gatherings also took place in Xi'an and Shanghai on 16 April On 17 April, students at the China University of Political Science and Law (CUPL) made a large wreath to commemorate Hu Yaobang Its wreath-laying ceremony was on 17 April, and a larger-than-expected crowd assembled [83] At 5 pm, 500 CUPL students reached the eastern gate of the Great Hall of the People, near Tiananmen Square, to mourn Hu The gathering featured speakers from various backgrounds who gave public orations commemorating Hu and discussed social problems However, it was soon deemed obstructive to the Great Hall's operation, so police tried to persuade the students to disperse.\n\n\nDeath of Hu Yaobang\nWhen Hu Yaobang suddenly died of a heart attack

speakers from various backgrounds who gave public orations commemorating Hu and discussed social problems However, it was soon deemed obstructive to the Great Hall's operation, so police tried to persuade the students to disperse.\n\n\nRioting on 22 April\nOn 22 April, near dusk, serious rioting broke out in Changsha and Xi'an In Xi'an, arson by rioters destroyed cars and houses, and looting occurred in shops near the city's Xihua Gate In Changsha, 38 stores were ransacked by looters Over 350 people were arrested in both cities for looting [94] In Wuhan, university students organized protests against the provincial government As the situation became more volatile nationally, Zhao Ziyang called numerous meetings of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) Zhao stressed three points: discourage students from further protests and ask them to go back to class, use all measures necessary to combat rioting, and open forms of dialogue with students at different levels of government [94] Premier Li Peng called upon Zhao to condemn protestors and recognize the need to take more serious action Zhao dismissed Li's views Despite calls for him to remain in Beijing, Zhao left for a scheduled state visit to North Korea on 23 April [95]\n\n\n26 April Editorial\nZhao's departure to North Korea left Li Peng as the acting executive authority in Beijing On 24 April, Li Peng and the PSC met with Beijing Party Secretary Li Ximing and mayor Chen Xitong to gauge the situation at the square The municipal officials wanted a quick resolution to the crisis and framed the protests as a conspiracy to overthrow China's political system and prominent party leaders, including Deng Xiaoping In Zhao's absence, the PSC agreed to take firm action against the protesters [95] On the morning of 25 April, President Yang Shangkun and Premier Li Peng met with Deng at the latter's residence Deng endorsed a hardline stance and said an appropriate warning must be disseminated via mass media to curb further demonstrations [96] The meeting firmly established the first official evaluation of the protests, and highlighted Deng's having \"final say\" on important issues Li Peng subsequently ordered Deng's views to be drafted as a communique and issued to all high-level Communist Party officials to mobilize the party apparatus against protesters.\n\n\n27 April demonstrations\nOrganized by the Union on 27 April, some 50,000–100,000 students from all Beijing universities marched through the streets of the capital to Tiananmen Square, breaking through lines set up by police, and receiving widespread public support along the way, particularly from factory workers [56] The student leaders, eager to show the patriotic nature of the movement, also toned down anti-Communist slogans, choosing to present a message of \"anti-corruption\" and \"anti-cronyism\", but \"pro-party\" [98] In a twist of irony, student factions who genuinely called for the overthrow of the Communist Party gained traction due to the 26 April editorial [98]\n\n\nEscalation of the protests\nThe government was divided on how to respond to the movement as early as mid-April After Zhao Ziyang's return from North Korea, tensions between the progressive camp and the conservative camp intensified Those who supported continued dialogue and a soft approach with students rallied behind Zhao Ziyang, while hardliner conservatives opposed the movement rallied behind Premier Li Peng Zhao and Li clashed at a PSC meeting on 1 May Li maintained that the need for stability overrode all else, while Zhao said that the party should show support for increased democracy and transparency Zhao pushed the case for further dialogue [101]\n\n\nPreparing for dialogue\nThe government was divided on how to respond to the movement as early as mid-April After Zhao Ziyang's return from North Korea, tensions between the progressive camp and the conservative camp intensified Those who supported continued dialogue and a soft approach with students rallied behind Zhao Ziyang, while hardliner conservatives opposed the movement rallied behind Premier Li Peng Zhao and Li clashed at a PSC meeting on 1 May Li maintained that the need for stability overrode all else, while Zhao said that the party should show support for increased democracy and transparency Zhao pushed the case for further dialogue [101]\n\n\nHunger strikes begin\nStudents began the hunger strike on 13 May, two days before the highly publicized state visit by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev Knowing that Gorbachev's welcoming ceremony was scheduled to be held on the square, student leaders wanted to use the hunger strike to force the government into meeting their demands Moreover, the hunger strike gained widespread sympathy from the population at large and earned the student movement the moral high ground that it sought [106] By the afternoon of 13 May, some 300,000 were gathered at the square [107]\n\n\nMikhail Gorbachev's visit\nPress restrictions were loosened significantly from early to mid-May State media began broadcasting footage sympathetic to protesters and the movement, including the hunger strikers On 14 May, intellectuals led by Dai Qing gained permission from Hu Qili to bypass government censorship and air the progressive views of the nation's intellectuals in the Guangming Daily The intellectuals then issued an urgent appeal for the students to leave the square in an attempt to deescalate the conflict [107] However, many students believed that the intellectuals were speaking for the government and refused to move That evening, formal negotiations took place between government representatives led by Yan Mingfu and student representatives led by Shen Tong and Xiang Xiaoji Yan affirmed the student movement's patriotic nature and pleaded for the students to withdraw from the square [110] While Yan's apparent sincerity for compromise satisfied some students, the meeting grew increasingly chaotic as competing student factions relayed uncoordinated and incoherent demands to the leadership Shortly after student leaders learned that the event had not been broadcast nationally, as initially promised by the government, the meeting fell apart [111] Yan then personally went to the square to appeal to the students, even offering himself to be held hostage [56] Yan also took the student's pleas to Li Peng the next day, asking Li to consider formally retracting the 26 April Editorial and rebranding the movement as \"patriotic and democratic\"; Li refused [112]\n\n\nGathering momentum\nThe hunger strikes galvanized support for the students and aroused sympathy across the country Around a million Beijing residents from all walks of life demonstrated in solidarity from 17 to 18 May These included PLA personnel, police officers, and lower party officials [9] Many grassroots Party and Youth League organizations, as well as government-sponsored labor unions, encouraged their membership to demonstrate [9] In addition, several of China's non-Communist parties sent a letter to Li Peng to support the students The Chinese Red Cross issued a special notice and sent in many personnel to provide medical services to the hunger strikers on the square After the departure of Mikhail Gorbachev, many foreign journalists remained in the Chinese capital to cover the protests, shining an international spotlight on the movement Western governments urged Beijing to exercise restraint [citation needed]\n\n\nSurveillance of protesters\nStudent leaders were put under close surveillance by the authorities; traffic cameras were used to perform surveillance on the square; and nearby restaurants, and wherever students gathered, were wiretapped [130] This surveillance led to the identification, capture, and punishment of protest participants [131] After the massacre, the government did thorough interrogations at work units, institutions, and schools to identify who had been at the protest [132]\n\n\nOutside Beijing\nOn 19 April, the editors of the World Economic Herald, a magazine close to reformists, decided to publish a commemorative section on Hu Inside was an article by Yan Jiaqi, which commented favorably on the Beijing student protests, and called for a reassessment of Hu's 1987 purge Sensing the conservative political trends in Beijing, Jiang Zemin demanded that the article be censored, and many newspapers were printed with a blank page [133] Jiang then suspended lead editor Qin Benli, his decisive action earning the trust of conservative party elders, who praised Jiang's loyalty.\n\n\nMilitary action\nThe Chinese government declared martial law on 20 May and mobilized at least 30 divisions from five of the country's seven military regions [137] At least 14 of the PLA's 24 army corps contributed troops [137] Guangzhou's civil aviation authorities suspended civil airline travel to prepare for transporting military units [138]\n\n\nMartial law\nThe Chinese government declared martial law on 20 May and mobilized at least 30 divisions from five of the country's seven military regions [137] At least 14 of the PLA's 24

report titled \"On the True Nature of the Turmoil\", which was circulated to every member of the Politburo [142] The report concludes that the demonstrators' leadership, referred to as a \"tiny minority\", had \"organized and plotted the turmoil\", and that they were using the square as a base to provoke conflict in order to create an international impact  [143] It also maintains that they had formed connections with criminal elements and used funding from foreign and domestic sources to improve their communications equipment and procure weapons  [144]\n\n\nLi Peng's Report\nOn 1 June,

same day, another report, issued by Ministry of State Security chief Jia Chunwang, was submitted to the party leadership, and likewise sent to every member of the Politburo, as well as to senior Party elders, including Deng Xiaoping, Li Xiannian and Chen Yun  [145]\n\n\n2–3 June\nIn conjunction with the plan to clear the square by force, the Politburo received word from army headquarters stating that troops were ready to help stabilize the capital and that they understood the necessity and legality of martial law to overcome the turmoil [151]\n\n\n3–4 June\nIn the evening on 3 June, the government issued an emergency announcement urging citizens to \"stay off the streets and away from Tiananmen Square\"  [167] Meanwhile, protesters made their own broadcasts across various university campuses in Beijing to call for students and citizens to arm themselves and assemble at intersections and the Square [167]\n\n\nChang'an Avenue\nOn June 3, at 8:00 p.m., the 38th Army, led by interim commander Zhang Meiyuan, began to advance from military office compounds in Shijingshan and Fentai District in western Beijing along the western extension of Chang'an Avenue toward the square to the east [168]  At 9:30 p.m, this army encountered a blockade set up by protesters at Gongzhufen in Haidian District, and made an attempt to break through [169] Troops armed with anti-riot gear clashed with the protesters, firing rubber bullets and tear gas, while the protesters threw rocks, bricks, and bottles at them [169] Other troops fired warning shots into the air, which was ineffective [169] At 10:10 pm, an army officer picked up a megaphone and urged the protesters to disperse [169]\n\n\nClearing the square\nAt the Square, soldiers and students initially attempted to show restraint, but that residents refused to follow student orders [183] Soldiers did not fight back at first after some citizens threw rocks at them [184]  [185]\n\n\nIn the city\nJust past 6 am on 4 June, as a convoy of students who had vacated the square were walking westward in the bicycle lane along Chang'an Avenue back to campus, three tanks pursued them from the square, firing tear gas [199] One tank was said to have driven through the crowd, killing 11 students and injuring scores of others [200]\n\n\n5 June and the Tank Man\nOn June 5, having secured the square, the military began to reassert control over thoroughfares through the city, especially Chang'an Avenue A column of tanks of the 1st Armored Division left the square and, heading east on Chang'an Avenue, came upon a lone protester standing in the middle of the avenue The brief standoff between the man and the tanks was captured by Western media atop the Beijing Hotel After returning to his position in front of the tanks, the man was pulled aside by a group of people [11] Charlie Cole, who was there for Newsweek, claimed that the men were Chinese government agents, [205] while Jan Wong, who was there for The Globe and Mail, thought that they were concerned bystanders [206]\n\n\nProtests outside Beijing\nAfter order was restored in Beijing on 4 June, protests of various sizes continued in some 80 other Chinese cities outside the international press's spotlight [214] In the British colony of Hong Kong, people again took to wearing black in solidarity with the demonstrators in Beijing There were also protests in other countries, where many adopted the wearing of black armbands as well [215]\n\n\nGovernment's pronouncements\nAt a news conference on 6 June, State Council spokesperson Yuan Mu announced that based on \"preliminary statistics\", \"nearly 300 people died .. includ [ing] soldiers\", 23 students, \"bad elements who deserve [d] this because of their crimes, and people who were killed by mistake.\" [223] He said the wounded included \"5,000  [police] officers and  [soldiers]\" and over \"2,000 civilians, including the handful of lawless ruffians and the onlooking masses who do understand the situation.\" [223] Military spokesperson Zhang Gong stated that no one was killed in Tiananmen Square and no one was run over by tanks in the square [224]\n\n\nDeath toll\nThe number of deaths and the extent of bloodshed in the square itself have been in dispute since the events The government actively suppressed discussion of casualty figures immediately after the events, and estimates rely heavily on eyewitness testimony, hospital records, and organized efforts by victims' relatives As a result, large discrepancies exist among various casualty estimates Initial estimates ranged from the official figure of a few hundred to several thousand [231]\n\n\nOfficial figures\nOfficial government announcements shortly after the event put the number who died at around 300 At the State Council press conference on 6 June, spokesman Yuan Mu said that \"preliminary tallies\" by the government showed that about 300 civilians and soldiers died, including 23 students from universities in Beijing, along with some people he described as \"ruffians\" [223] [232] Yuan also said some 5,000 soldiers and police were wounded, along with 2,000 civilians On 19 June, Beijing Party Secretary Li Ximing reported to the Politburo that the government's confirmed death toll was 241, including 218 civilians (of which 36 were students), 10 PLA soldiers, and 13 People's Armed Police, along with 7,000 wounded [233] [234] On 30 June, Mayor Chen Xitong said that the number of injured was around 6,000 [232] [223]\n\n\nOther estimates\nOn the morning of 4 June, many estimates of deaths were reported, including from government-affiliated sources Peking University leaflets circulated on campus suggested a death toll of between two and three thousand The Chinese Red Cross had given a figure of 2,600 deaths but later denied having given such a figure [16] [17] The Swiss Ambassador had estimated 2,700 [18] Nicholas D Kristof of The New York Times wrote on 21 June that \"it seems plausible that about a dozen soldiers and policemen were killed, along with 400 to 800 civilians.\" [19] United States ambassador James Lilley said that, based on visits to hospitals around Beijing, a minimum of several hundred had been killed [235] A declassified National Security Agency cable filed on the same day estimated 180–500 deaths up to the morning of 4 June [176] Beijing hospital records compiled shortly after the events recorded at least 478 dead and 920 wounded [236] Amnesty International's estimates put the number of deaths at between several hundred and close to 1,000, [16] [21] while a Western diplomat who compiled estimates put the number at 300 to 1,000 [19]\n\n\nIdentifying the dead\nThe Tiananmen Mothers, a victims' advocacy group co-founded by Ding Zilin and Zhang Xianling, whose children were killed by the government during the crackdown, have identified 202 victims as of August 2011 [update] In the face of government interference, the group has worked painstakingly to locate victims' families and collect information about the victims Their tally had grown from 155 in 1999 to 202 in 2011 The list includes four individuals who committed suicide on or after 4 June for reasons related to their involvement in the demonstrations [citation needed] [e]\n\n\nDeaths around and in Tiananmen Square itself\nGovernment officials have long asserted that no one died in the square in the early morning hours of 4 June, during the \"hold-out\" of students' last batch in the south part of the square Initially, foreign media reports of a \"massacre\" on the square were prevalent, though subsequently, journalists have acknowledged that most of the deaths occurred outside of the square in western Beijing Several people who were situated around the square that night, including former Beijing bureau chief of The Washington Post Jay Mathews [f] and CBS correspondent Richard Roth [g] reported that while they had heard sporadic gunfire, they could not find enough evidence to suggest that a massacre took place on the square.\n\n\nImmediate aftermath\nOn 13 June 1989, the Beijing Public Security Bureau released an order for the arrest of 21 students they identified as the protest leaders These 21 most-wanted student leaders were part of the Beijing Students Autonomous Federation, [249] which had been instrumental in the Tiananmen Square protests Though decades have passed, this most-wanted list has never been retracted by the Chinese government [250]\n\n\nArrests, punishments, and evacuations\nOn 13 June 1989, the Beijing Public Security Bureau released an order for the arrest of 21 students they identified as the protest leaders These 21 most-wanted student leaders were part of the Beijing Students Autonomous Federation, [249] which had been instrumental in the Tiananmen Square protests Though decades have passed, this most-wanted list has never been retracted by the Chinese government [250]\n\n\nLeadership changes\nThe party leadership expelled Zhao Ziyang from the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) Hu Qili, another PSC member who opposed martial law but abstained from voting, was also removed from the committee However, he was able to retain his party membership, and after \"changing his opinion\", he was reassigned as deputy minister in the Ministry for Machinery and Electronics Industry Another reform-minded Chinese leader, Wan Li, was also put under house arrest immediately after he stepped out of his plane at Beijing Capital Airport upon returning from a shortened trip abroad; the authorities declared his detention to be on health grounds When Wan Li was released from his house arrest after he finally \"changed his opinion\", he, like Qiao Shi, was transferred to a different position with equal rank but a mostly ceremonial role Several Chinese ambassadors abroad claimed political asylum [263]\n\n\nMedia coverage\nThe official narrative constructed by the Chinese Communist Party on 4 June Incident states that the use of force was necessary to control \"political turmoil\", [267] and this also ensures the stable society that is necessary for successful economic development [268] [269] [270] Chinese leaders—including Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, who were general secretaries of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party—consistently reiterated the official narrative of the Chinese Communist Party when being asked about the protests by foreign journalists [271]\n\n\nOfficial narrative\nThe official narrative

Party—consistently reiterated the official narrative of the Chinese Communist Party when being asked about the protests by foreign journalists [271]\n\n\nChinese media\nThe suppression of 4 June marked the end of a period of relative press freedom in China, and media workers—both foreign and domestic—faced heightened restrictions and punishment in the aftermath of the crackdown State media reports in the immediate aftermath were sympathetic to the students As a result, those responsible were all later removed from their posts Two news anchors, Du Xian and Xue Fei, who reported this event on 4 and 5 June, respectively in the daily Xinwen Lianbo broadcast on China Central Television, were fired because they openly emoted in sympathy with the protesters Wu Xiaoyong, the son of the former foreign minister Wu Xueqian, was removed from the English Program Department of Chinese Radio International, ostensibly for his sympathies towards protesters Editors and other staff at the People's Daily, including director Qian Liren and Editor-in-Chief Tan Wenrui, were also sacked because of reports in the paper that were sympathetic towards the protesters [273]\n\n\nForeign media\nWith the imposition of martial law, the Chinese government cut off Western broadcasters' satellite transmissions such as CNN and CBS Broadcasters tried to defy these orders by reporting via telephone Video footage was smuggled out of the country, although the only network that was able to record video during the night of 4 June was Televisión Española of Spain (TVE) [277] During the military action, some foreign journalists faced harassment from authorities CBS correspondent Richard Roth and his cameraman were taken into custody while filing a report from the square via mobile phone [278]\n\n\nReactions\nThe Chinese government's response was widely denounced by Western governments and media [284] According to Suisheng Zhao, Asian countries generally remained silent throughout the protests; [285] India's government under Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi responded to the massacre by ordering the state television to offer only the absolute minimum coverage of the incident so as not to jeopardize a thawing in relations with China and to empathize with the Chinese government [286] The Communist Party of India (Marxist) was the only political party in the world to pass a resolution supporting the crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protests, calling them \"an imperialist attempt to internally subvert socialism,  [which] was successfully thwarted by the CPC and the PLA.\" [287] [288] [289] [290]\n\n\nLonger-term impact\nAs the party departed from the orthodox communism it was founded upon, much of its attention was focused on the cultivation of nationalism as an alternative ideology [293] This policy largely succeeded in tying the party's legitimacy to China's \"national pride\", turning domestic public opinion back in its favor [294]\n\n\nPolitics\nAs the party departed from the orthodox communism it was founded upon, much of its attention was focused on the cultivation of nationalism as an alternative ideology [293] This policy largely succeeded in tying the party's legitimacy to China's \"national pride\", turning domestic public opinion back in its favor [294]\n\n\nEconomy\nAfter the Tiananmen Square protests, many business analysts downgraded their outlook for China's economic future [41] The violent response to the protests was one of the factors that led to a delay in China's acceptance in the World Trade Organization, which was not completed until twelve years later, in 2001 [41] Furthermore, bilateral aid to China decreased from $3.4 billion in 1988 to $700 million in 1990 [297] Loans to China were suspended by the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and foreign governments; [298] China's credit rating was lowered; [297] tourism revenue decreased from US$2.2 billion to US$1.8 billion; and foreign direct investment commitments were canceled However, there was a rise in government defense spending from 8.6% in 1986, to 15.5% in 1990, reversing a previous 10-year decline [299]\n\n\nHong Kong\nIn Hong Kong, the Tiananmen Square protests led to fears that China would renege on its commitments under one country, two systems, following the impending handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom in 1997 In response, Governor Chris Patten tried to expand the franchise for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, which led to friction with Beijing For many Hongkongers, Tiananmen served as the turning point when they lost trust in the Beijing government The event, coupled with general uncertainty about the status of Hong Kong after the transfer of sovereignty, led to a sizable exodus of Hong Kongers to Western countries such as Canada and Australia before 1997.\n\n\nChina's image internationally\nThe Chinese government drew widespread condemnation for its suppression of the protests In the immediate aftermath, China seemed to be becoming a pariah state, increasingly isolated internationally This was a significant setback for the leadership, who had courted international investment for much of the 1980s, as the country emerged from the chaos of the Cultural Revolution; however, Deng Xiaoping and the core leadership vowed to continue economic liberalization policies after 1989 [306] From there on, China would work domestically and internationally to reshape its national image from that of a repressive regime to that of a benign global economic and military partner [307]\n\n\nEuropean Union and the United States arms embargo\nThe European Union and United States embargo on armament sales to China, put in place due to the violent suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests, remains in place today China has been calling for a lift of the ban for years and has had a varying amount of support from European Union members Since 2004, China has portrayed the ban as \"outdated\" and damaging to China–European Union relations In early 2004, French President Jacques Chirac spearheaded a movement within the European Union to lift the ban, his efforts being supported by German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder However, the passing of the Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China, in March 2005, increased tensions between mainland China and Taiwan, damaging attempts to lift the ban; and several European Union Council members retracted their support for a lift of the ban Moreover, Schröder's successor Angela Merkel opposed lifting the ban Members of the United States Congress had also proposed restrictions on the transfer of military technology to the European Union if the latter lifted the ban The United Kingdom also opposed the embargo lifting when it took charge of the European Union presidency in July 2005.\n\n\nContemporary issues\nThe Chinese government continues to forbid discussions about the Tiananmen Square protests [314] [315] and has taken measures to block or censor related information, in an attempt to suppress the public's memory of the Tiananmen Square protests [316] Textbooks contain little, if any, information about the protests [317] After the protests, officials banned controversial films and books and shut down many newspapers Within a year, 12% of all newspapers, 8% of all publishing companies, 13% of all social science periodicals, and more than 150 films were either banned or shut down The government also announced that it had seized 32 million contraband books and 2.4 million video and audio cassettes [318] Access to media and Internet resources about the subject are either restricted or blocked by censors [319] Banned literature and films include Summer Palace, [320] Forbidden City, Collection of June Fourth Poems, [citation needed] The Critical Moment: Li Peng diaries and any writings of Zhao Ziyang or his aide Bao Tong, including Zhao's memoirs.\n\n\nCensorship in China\nThe

President Hu Jintao that sought to have the government reevaluate its position on the protests He was subsequently arrested and taken from his home [335]\n\n\nChinese leaders voicing regret\nBefore his death in 1998, Yang Shangkun told army doctor Jiang Yanyong that 4 June was the most serious mistake committed by the Communist Party in its history, a mistake that Yang himself could not correct, but one that certainly will eventually be corrected [337] Zhao Ziyang remained under house arrest until his death in 2005 Zhao's aide Bao Tong has repeatedly called on the government to reverse its verdict on the demonstrations Chen Xitong, the mayor of Beijing, who read the martial law order and was later disgraced by a political scandal, expressed regret in 2012, a year before his death, for

by the Chinese government that took place in Beijing, China, from April to June 1989. The protests were a series of demonstrations by students, intellectuals, and workers that were sparked by the death of Hu Yaobang, a reform-minded Chinese leader, and a sense of discontent with the government's handling of economic and social issues.\n\n**Naming**\n\nThe Chinese government has used numerous names for the event since 1989. As the events unfolded, it was labeled a \"counter revolutionary rebellion\", which was later changed to simply \"riot\", followed by \"political turmoil\" and \"1989 storm\".\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Cultural Revolution ended with chairman Mao Zedong's death in 1976 and the arrest of the Gang of Four. This movement, spearheaded by Mao, had caused severe damage to the country's initially diverse economic and social fabric. As a result, the country was now mired in poverty as economic production slowed or came to a halt. Political ideology was paramount in the lives of ordinary people as well as the inner workings of the party itself.\n\n**Boluan Fanzheng and economic reforms**\n\nThe Cultural Revolution ended with chairman Mao Zedong's death in 1976 and the arrest of the Gang of Four. This movement, spearheaded by Mao, had caused severe damage to the country's initially diverse economic and social fabric. As a result, the country was now mired in poverty as economic production slowed or came to a halt. Political ideology was paramount in the lives of ordinary people as well as the inner workings of the party itself.\n\n**Challenges to Reforms and Opening-up**\n\nDeng's reforms aimed to decrease the state's role in the economy and gradually allow private production in agriculture and industry. By 1981, roughly 73% of rural farms had been de-collectivized, and 80% of state-owned enterprises were permitted to retain their profits.\n\n**Social disenfranchisement and legitimacy crisis**\n\nIn 1978, reformist leaders had envisioned that intellectuals would play a leading role in guiding the country through reforms, but this did not happen as planned. On one hand, the massive New Enlightenment movement led by intellectuals promoted a variety of liberal philosophies and values that challenged the socialist ideology, ranging from democracy, humanism, universal values such as freedom and human rights, to Total Westernization. As response, since the beginning of the reforms, Deng Xiaoping in 1979 proposed the \"Four Cardinal Principles\" to limit the political liberalization.\n\n**1986 student demonstrations**\n\nIn mid-1986, astrophysics professor Fang Lizhi returned from a position at Princeton University and began a personal tour of universities in China, speaking about liberty, human rights, and the separation of powers. Fang was part of a wide undercurrent within the elite intellectual community that thought China's poverty and underdevelopment, and the disaster of the Cultural Revolution, were a direct result of China's authoritarian political system and rigid command economy.\n\n**Preparing for dialogue**\n\nThe government was divided on how to respond to the movement as early as mid-April. After Zhao Ziyang's return from North Korea, tensions between the progressive camp and the conservative camp intensified. Those who supported continued dialogue and a soft approach with students rallied behind Zhao Ziyang, while hardliner conservatives opposed the movement rallied behind Premier Li Peng.\n\n**Hunger strikes begin**\n\nStudents began the hunger strike on 13 May, two days before the highly publicized state visit by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Knowing that Gorbachev's welcoming ceremony was scheduled to be held on the square, student leaders wanted to use the hunger strike to force the government into meeting their demands.\n\n**Mikhail Gorbachev's visit**\n\nPress restrictions were loosened significantly from early to mid-May. State media began broadcasting footage sympathetic to protesters and the movement, including the hunger strikers. Intellectuals led by Dai Qing gained permission from Hu Qili to bypass government censorship and air the progressive views of the nation's intellectuals in the Guangming Daily.\n\n**Protests outside Beijing**\n\nAfter order was restored in Beijing on 4 June, protests of various sizes continued in some 80 other Chinese cities outside the international press's spotlight. In the British colony of Hong Kong, people again took to wearing black in solidarity with the demonstrators in Beijing.\n\n**Government's pronouncements**\n\nAt a news conference on 6 June, State Council spokesperson Yuan Mu announced that based on \"preliminary statistics\", \"nearly 300 people died .. includ [ing] soldiers\", 23 students, \"bad elements who deserve [d] this because of their crimes, and people who were killed by mistake.\" He said the wounded included \"5,000  [police] officers and  [soldiers]\" and over \"2,000 civilians, including the handful of lawless ruffians and the onlooking masses who do understand the situation.\"\n\n**Death toll**\n\nThe number of deaths and the extent of bloodshed in the square itself have been in dispute since the events. Official government announcements shortly after the event put the number who died at around 300. Beijing hospital records compiled shortly after the events recorded at least 478 dead and 920 wounded.\n\n**Arrests, punishments, and evacuation**\n\nOn 13 June 1989, the Beijing Public Security Bureau released an order for the arrest of 21 students they identified as the protest leaders. These 21 most-wanted student leaders were part of the Beijing Students Autonomous Federation, which had been instrumental in the Tiananmen Square protests.\n\n**Leadership changes**\n\nThe party leadership expelled Zhao Ziyang from the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) Hu Qili, another PSC member who opposed martial law but abstained from voting, was also removed from the committee. Another reform-minded Chinese leader, Wan Li, was also put under house arrest immediately after he stepped out of his plane at Beijing Capital Airport upon returning from a shortened trip abroad.\n\n**Media coverage**\n\nThe Chinese government drew widespread condemnation for its suppression of the protests. The official narrative constructed by the Chinese Communist Party on 4 June Incident states that the use of force was necessary to control \"political turmoil\", and this also ensures the stable society that is necessary for successful economic development.\n\n**Censorship in China**\n\nThe Chinese government continues to forbid discussions about the Tiananmen Square protests and has taken measures to block or censor related information, in an attempt to suppress the public's memory of the Tiananmen Square protests.\n\n**United Nations report**\n\nDuring its 41st session, from 3–21 November 2008, the UN Committee Against Torture expressed concern over the lack of investigations into the reports of people \"killed, arrested or disappeared on or following the 4 June 1989 Beijing suppression.\" It stated that the Chinese government had also failed to inform relatives of those individuals' fate, despite relatives' numerous requests.\n\n**Gallery**\n\nA few people may have been killed by random shooting on streets near the square, but all verified eyewitness accounts say that the students who remained in the square when troops arrived were allowed to leave peacefully.

roughly 73% of rural farms had been de-collectivized, and 80% of state-owned enterprises were permitted to retain their profits.\n\n\nSocial disenfranchisement and legitimacy crisis\nIn 1978, reformist leaders had envisioned that intellectuals would play a leading role in guiding the country through reforms, but this did not happen as planned [48] On one hand, the massive New Enlightenment movement led by intellectuals promoted a variety of liberal philosophies and values that challenged the socialist ideology, ranging from democracy, humanism, universal values such as freedom and human rights, to Total Westernization; [27] [49] as response, since the beginning of the reforms, Deng Xiaoping in 1979 proposed the \"Four Cardinal Principles\" to limit the political liberalization [50] On the other hand, despite the opening of new universities and increased enrollment, [51] the state-directed education system did not produce enough graduates to meet increased demand in the areas of agriculture, light industry, services, and foreign investment [52] The job market was especially limited for students specializing in social sciences and the humanities [51] Moreover, private companies no longer needed to accept students assigned to them by the state, and many high-paying jobs were offered based on nepotism and favoritism [53] Gaining a good state-assigned placement meant navigating a highly inefficient bureaucracy that gave power to officials who had little expertise in areas under their jurisdiction [47] Facing a dismal job market and limited chances of going abroad, intellectuals and students had a greater vested interest in political issues Small study groups, such as the \"Democracy Salon\" (Chinese: 民主沙龙; pinyin: Mínzhǔ Shālóng) and the \"Lawn Salon\" (草地沙龙; Cǎodì Shālóng), began appearing on Beijing university campuses [54] These organizations motivated the students to get involved politically [46]\n\n\n1986 student demonstrations\nIn mid-1986, astrophysics professor Fang Lizhi returned from a position at Princeton University and began a personal tour of universities in China, speaking about liberty, human rights, and the separation of powers Fang was part of a wide undercurrent within the elite intellectual community that thought China's poverty and underdevelopment, and the disaster of the Cultural Revolution, were a direct result of China's authoritarian political system and rigid command economy [57] The view that political reform was the only answer to China's ongoing problems gained widespread appeal among students, as Fang's recorded speeches became widely circulated throughout the country [58] In response, Deng Xiaoping warned that Fang was blindly worshipping Western lifestyles, capitalism, and multi-party systems while undermining China's socialist ideology, traditional values, and the party's leadership [58]\n\n\nPolitical reforms\nOn 18 August 1980, Deng Xiaoping gave a speech titled \"On the Reform of the Party and State Leadership System\" (\"党和国家领导制度改革\") at a full meeting of the CCP Politburo in Beijing, launching political reforms in China [62] [63] [64] He called for a systematic revision of China's constitution, criticizing bureaucracy, centralization of power, and patriarchy, while proposing term limits for the leading positions in China and advocating \"democratic centralism\" and \"collective leadership.\" [62] [63] [64] In December 1982, the fourth and current Constitution of China, known as the \"1982 Constitution\", was passed by the 5th National People's Congress [65] [66]\n\n\nFunding and support\nDuring the demonstrations, protesters received a significant amount of support from domestic and outside sources [77] The Chinese University in Hong Kong donated HK$10,000 by early May, [78]: 313  and groups such as the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China were founded in support of the protests Funding also came from the United States, Canada, Japan, Taiwan, Australia, and countries across Europe [79]\n\n\nBeginning of the 1989 protests\nWhen Hu Yaobang suddenly died of a heart attack on 15 April 1989, students reacted strongly, most of them believing that his death was related to his forced resignation [80] Hu's death provided the initial impetus for students to gather in large numbers [81] On university campuses, many posters appeared eulogizing Hu, calling for honoring Hu's legacy Within days, most posters were about broader political issues, such as corruption, democracy, and freedom of the press [82] Small, spontaneous gatherings to mourn Hu began on 15 April around the Monument to the People's Heroes at Tiananmen Square On the same day, many students at Peking University (PKU) and Tsinghua University erected shrines and joined the gathering in Tiananmen Square in a piecemeal fashion [clarification needed] Small, organized student gatherings also took place in Xi'an and Shanghai on 16 April On 17 April, students at the China University of Political Science and Law (CUPL) made a large wreath to commemorate Hu Yaobang Its wreath-laying ceremony was on 17 April, and a larger-than-expected crowd assembled [83] At 5 pm, 500 CUPL students reached the eastern gate of the Great Hall of the People, near Tiananmen Square, to mourn Hu The gathering featured speakers from various backgrounds who gave public orations commemorating Hu and discussed social problems However, it was soon deemed obstructive to the Great Hall's operation, so police tried to persuade the students to disperse.\n\n\nDeath of Hu Yaobang\nWhen Hu Yaobang suddenly died of a heart attack on 15 April 1989, students reacted strongly, most of them believing that his death was related to his

problems However, it was soon deemed obstructive to the Great Hall's operation, so police tried to persuade the students to disperse.\n\n\nRioting on 22 April\nOn 22 April, near dusk, serious rioting broke out in Changsha and Xi'an In Xi'an, arson by rioters destroyed cars and houses, and looting occurred in shops near the city's Xihua Gate In Changsha, 38 stores were ransacked by looters Over 350 people were arrested in both cities for looting [94] In Wuhan, university students organized protests against the provincial government As the situation became more volatile nationally, Zhao Ziyang called numerous meetings of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) Zhao stressed three points: discourage students from further protests and ask them to go back to class, use all measures necessary to combat rioting, and open forms of dialogue with students at different levels of government [94] Premier Li Peng called upon Zhao to condemn protestors and recognize the need to take more serious action Zhao dismissed Li's views Despite calls for him to remain in Beijing, Zhao left for a scheduled state visit to North Korea on 23 April [95]\n\n\n26 April Editorial\nZhao's departure to North Korea left Li Peng as the acting executive authority in Beijing On 24 April, Li Peng and the PSC met with Beijing Party Secretary Li Ximing and mayor Chen Xitong to gauge the situation at the square The municipal officials wanted a quick resolution to the crisis and framed the protests as a conspiracy to overthrow China's political system and prominent party leaders, including Deng Xiaoping In Zhao's absence, the PSC agreed to take firm action against the protesters [95] On the morning of 25 April, President Yang Shangkun and Premier Li Peng met with Deng at the latter's residence Deng endorsed a hardline stance and said an appropriate warning must be disseminated via mass media to curb further demonstrations [96] The meeting firmly established the first official evaluation of the protests, and highlighted Deng's having \"final say\" on important issues Li Peng subsequently ordered Deng's views to be drafted as a communique and issued to all high-level Communist Party officials to mobilize the party apparatus against protesters.\n\n\n27 April demonstrations\nOrganized by the Union on 27 April, some 50,000–100,000 students from all Beijing universities marched through the streets of the capital to Tiananmen Square, breaking through lines set up by police, and receiving widespread public support along the way, particularly from factory workers [56] The student leaders, eager to show the patriotic nature of the movement, also toned down anti-Communist slogans, choosing to present a message of \"anti-corruption\" and \"anti-cronyism\", but \"pro-party\" [98] In a twist of irony, student factions who genuinely called for the overthrow of the Communist Party gained traction due to the 26 April editorial [98]\n\n\nEscalation of the protests\nThe government was divided on how to respond to the movement as early as mid-April After Zhao Ziyang's return from North Korea, tensions between the progressive camp and the conservative camp intensified Those who supported continued dialogue and a soft approach with students rallied behind Zhao Ziyang, while hardliner conservatives opposed the movement rallied behind Premier Li Peng Zhao and Li clashed at a PSC meeting on 1 May Li maintained that the need for stability overrode all else, while Zhao said that the party should show support for increased democracy and transparency Zhao pushed the case for further dialogue [101]\n\n\nPreparing for dialogue\nThe government was divided on how to respond to the movement as early as mid-April After Zhao Ziyang's return from North Korea, tensions between the

state visit by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev Knowing that Gorbachev's welcoming ceremony was scheduled to be held on the square, student leaders wanted to use the hunger strike to force the government into meeting their demands Moreover, the hunger strike gained widespread sympathy from the population at large and earned the student movement the moral high ground that it sought [106] By the afternoon of 13 May, some 300,000 were gathered at the square [107]\n\n\nMikhail Gorbachev's visit\nPress restrictions were loosened significantly from early to mid-May State media began broadcasting footage sympathetic to protesters and the movement, including the hunger strikers On 14 May, intellectuals led by Dai Qing gained permission from Hu Qili to bypass government censorship and air the progressive views of the nation's intellectuals in the Guangming Daily The intellectuals then issued an urgent appeal for the students to leave the square in an attempt to deescalate the conflict [107] However, many students believed that the intellectuals were speaking for the government and refused to move That evening, formal negotiations took place between government representatives led by Yan Mingfu and student representatives led by Shen Tong and Xiang Xiaoji Yan affirmed the student movement's patriotic nature and pleaded for the students to withdraw from the square [110] While Yan's apparent sincerity for compromise satisfied some students, the meeting grew increasingly chaotic as competing student factions relayed uncoordinated and incoherent demands to the leadership Shortly after student leaders learned that the event had not been broadcast nationally, as initially promised by the government, the meeting fell apart [111] Yan then personally went to the square to appeal to the students, even offering himself to be held hostage [56] Yan also took the student's pleas to Li Peng the next day, asking Li to consider formally retracting the 26 April Editorial and rebranding the movement as \"patriotic and democratic\"; Li refused [112]\n\n\nGathering momentum\nThe hunger strikes galvanized support for the students and aroused sympathy across the country Around a million Beijing residents from all walks of life demonstrated in solidarity from 17 to 18 May These included PLA personnel, police officers, and lower party officials [9] Many grassroots Party and Youth League organizations, as well as government-sponsored labor unions, encouraged their membership to demonstrate [9] In addition, several of China's non-Communist parties sent a letter to Li Peng to support the students The Chinese Red Cross issued a special notice and sent in many personnel to provide medical services to the hunger strikers on the square After the departure of Mikhail Gorbachev, many foreign journalists remained in the Chinese capital to cover the protests, shining an international spotlight on the movement Western governments urged Beijing to exercise restraint [citation needed]\n\n\nSurveillance of protesters\nStudent leaders were put under close surveillance by the authorities; traffic cameras were used to perform surveillance on the square; and nearby restaurants, and wherever students gathered, were wiretapped [130] This surveillance led to the identification, capture, and punishment of protest participants [131] After the massacre, the government did thorough interrogations at work units, institutions, and schools to identify who had been at the protest [132]\n\n\nOutside Beijing\nOn 19 April, the editors of the World Economic Herald, a magazine close to reformists, decided to publish a commemorative section on Hu Inside was an article by Yan Jiaqi, which commented favorably on the Beijing student protests, and called for a reassessment of Hu's 1987 purge Sensing the conservative political trends in Beijing, Jiang Zemin demanded that the article be censored, and many newspapers were printed with a blank page [133] Jiang then suspended lead editor Qin Benli, his decisive action earning the trust of conservative party elders, who praised Jiang's loyalty.\n\n\nMilitary action\nThe Chinese government declared martial law on 20 May and mobilized at least 30 divisions from five of the country's seven military regions [137] At least 14 of the PLA's 24 army corps contributed troops [137] Guangzhou's civil aviation authorities suspended civil airline travel to prepare for transporting military units [138]\n\n\nMartial law\nThe Chinese government declared martial law on 20 May and mobilized at least 30

[142] The report concludes that the demonstrators' leadership, referred to as a \"tiny minority\", had \"organized and plotted the turmoil\", and that they were using the square as a base to provoke conflict in order to create an international impact  [143] It also maintains that they had formed connections with criminal elements and used funding from foreign and domestic sources to improve their communications equipment and procure weapons  [144]\n\n\nLi Peng's Report\nOn 1 June, Li Peng issued a report titled \"On the True Nature of the Turmoil\", which was circulated to every member of the

leadership, and likewise sent to every member of the Politburo, as well as to senior Party elders, including Deng Xiaoping, Li Xiannian and Chen Yun  [145]\n\n\n2–3 June\nIn conjunction with the plan to clear the square by force, the Politburo received word from army headquarters stating that troops were ready to help stabilize the capital and that they understood the necessity and legality of martial law to overcome the turmoil [151]\n\n\n3–4 June\nIn the evening on 3 June, the government issued an emergency announcement urging citizens to \"stay off the streets and away from Tiananmen Square\"  [167] Meanwhile, protesters made their own broadcasts across various university campuses in Beijing to call for students and citizens to arm themselves and assemble at intersections and the Square [167]\n\n\nChang'an Avenue\nOn June 3, at 8:00 p.m., the 38th Army, led by interim commander Zhang Meiyuan, began to advance from military office compounds in Shijingshan and Fentai District in western Beijing along the western extension of Chang'an Avenue toward the square to the east [168]  At 9:30 p.m, this army encountered a blockade set up by protesters at Gongzhufen in Haidian District, and made an attempt to break through [169] Troops armed with anti-riot gear clashed with the protesters, firing rubber bullets and tear gas, while the protesters threw rocks, bricks, and bottles at them [169] Other troops fired warning shots into the air, which was ineffective [169] At 10:10 pm, an army officer picked up a megaphone and urged the protesters to disperse [169]\n\n\nClearing the square\nAt the Square, soldiers and students initially attempted to show restraint, but that residents refused to follow student orders [183] Soldiers did not fight back at first after some citizens threw rocks at them [184]  [185]\n\n\nIn the city\nJust past 6 am on 4 June, as a convoy of students who had vacated the square were walking westward in the bicycle lane along Chang'an Avenue back to campus, three tanks pursued them from the square, firing tear gas [199] One tank was said to have driven through the crowd, killing 11 students and injuring scores of others [200]\n\n\n5 June and the Tank Man\nOn June 5, having secured the square, the military began to reassert control over thoroughfares through the city, especially Chang'an Avenue A column of tanks of the 1st Armored Division left the square and, heading east on Chang'an Avenue, came upon a lone protester standing in the middle of the avenue The brief standoff between the man and the tanks was captured by Western media atop the Beijing Hotel After returning to his position in front of the tanks, the man was pulled aside by a group of people [11] Charlie Cole, who was there for Newsweek, claimed that the men were Chinese government agents, [205] while Jan Wong, who was there for The Globe and Mail, thought that they were concerned bystanders [206]\n\n\nProtests outside Beijing\nAfter order was restored in Beijing on 4 June, protests of various sizes continued in some 80 other Chinese cities outside the international press's spotlight [214] In the British colony of Hong Kong, people again took to wearing black in solidarity with the demonstrators in Beijing There were also protests in other countries, where many adopted the wearing of black armbands as well [215]\n\n\nGovernment's pronouncements\nAt a news conference on 6 June, State Council spokesperson Yuan Mu announced that based on \"preliminary statistics\", \"nearly 300 people died .. includ [ing] soldiers\", 23 students, \"bad elements who deserve [d] this because of their crimes, and people who were killed by mistake.\" [223] He said the wounded included \"5,000  [police] officers and  [soldiers]\" and over \"2,000 civilians, including the handful of lawless ruffians and the onlooking masses who do understand the situation.\" [223] Military spokesperson Zhang Gong stated that no one was killed in Tiananmen Square and no one was run over by tanks in the square [224]\n\n\nDeath toll\nThe number of deaths and the extent of bloodshed in the square itself have been in dispute since the events The government actively suppressed discussion of casualty figures immediately after the events, and estimates rely heavily on eyewitness testimony, hospital records, and organized efforts by victims' relatives As a result, large discrepancies exist among various casualty estimates Initial estimates ranged from the official figure of a few hundred to several thousand [231]\n\n\nOfficial figures\nOfficial government announcements shortly after the event put the number who died at around 300 At the State Council press conference on 6 June, spokesman Yuan Mu said that \"preliminary tallies\" by the government showed that about 300 civilians and soldiers died, including 23 students from universities in Beijing, along with some people he described as \"ruffians\" [223] [232] Yuan also said some 5,000 soldiers and police were wounded, along with 2,000 civilians On 19 June, Beijing Party Secretary Li Ximing reported to the Politburo that the government's confirmed death toll was 241, including 218 civilians (of which 36 were students), 10 PLA soldiers, and 13 People's Armed Police, along with 7,000 wounded [233] [234] On 30 June, Mayor Chen Xitong said that the number of injured was around 6,000 [232] [223]\n\n\nOther estimates\nOn the morning of 4 June, many estimates of deaths were reported, including from government-affiliated sources Peking University leaflets circulated on campus suggested a death toll of between two and three thousand The Chinese Red Cross had given a figure of 2,600 deaths but later denied having given such a figure [16] [17] The Swiss Ambassador had estimated 2,700 [18] Nicholas D Kristof of The New York Times wrote on 21 June that \"it seems plausible that about a dozen soldiers and policemen were killed, along with 400 to 800 civilians.\" [19] United States ambassador James Lilley said that, based on visits to hospitals around Beijing, a minimum of several hundred had been killed [235] A declassified National Security Agency cable filed on the same day estimated 180–500 deaths up to the morning of 4 June [176] Beijing hospital records compiled shortly after the events recorded at least 478 dead and 920 wounded [236] Amnesty International's estimates put the number of deaths at between several hundred and close to 1,000, [16] [21] while a Western diplomat who compiled estimates put the number at 300 to 1,000 [19]\n\n\nIdentifying the dead\nThe Tiananmen Mothers, a victims' advocacy group co-founded by Ding Zilin and Zhang Xianling, whose children were killed by the government during the crackdown, have identified 202 victims as of August 2011 [update] In the face of government interference, the group has worked painstakingly to locate victims' families and collect information about the victims Their tally had grown from 155 in 1999 to 202 in 2011 The list includes four individuals who committed suicide on or after 4 June for reasons related to their involvement in the demonstrations [citation needed] [e]\n\n\nDeaths around and in Tiananmen Square itself\nGovernment officials have long asserted that no one died in the square in the early morning hours of 4 June, during the \"hold-out\" of students' last batch in the south part of the square Initially, foreign media reports of a \"massacre\" on the square were prevalent, though subsequently, journalists have acknowledged that most of the deaths occurred outside of the square in western Beijing Several people who were situated around the square that night, including former Beijing bureau chief of The Washington Post Jay Mathews [f] and CBS correspondent Richard Roth [g] reported that while they had heard sporadic gunfire, they could not find enough evidence to suggest that a massacre took place on the square.\n\n\nImmediate aftermath\nOn 13 June 1989, the Beijing Public Security Bureau released an order for the arrest of 21 students they identified as the protest leaders These 21 most-wanted student leaders were part of the Beijing Students Autonomous Federation, [249] which had been instrumental in the Tiananmen Square protests Though decades have passed, this most-wanted list has never been retracted by the Chinese government [250]\n\n\nArrests, punishments, and evacuations\nOn 13 June 1989, the Beijing Public Security Bureau released an order for the arrest of 21 students they identified as the protest leaders These 21 most-wanted student leaders were part of the Beijing Students Autonomous Federation, [249] which had been instrumental in the Tiananmen Square protests Though decades have passed, this most-wanted list has never been retracted by the Chinese government [250]\n\n\nLeadership changes\nThe party leadership expelled Zhao Ziyang from the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) Hu Qili, another PSC member who opposed martial law but abstained from voting, was also removed from the committee However, he was able to retain his party membership, and after \"changing his opinion\", he was reassigned as deputy minister in the Ministry for Machinery and Electronics Industry Another reform-minded Chinese leader, Wan Li, was also put under house arrest immediately after he stepped out of his plane at Beijing Capital Airport upon returning from a shortened trip abroad; the authorities declared his detention to be on health grounds When Wan Li was released from his house arrest after he finally \"changed his opinion\", he, like Qiao Shi, was transferred to a different position with equal rank but a mostly ceremonial role Several Chinese ambassadors abroad claimed political asylum [263]\n\n\nMedia coverage\nThe official narrative constructed by the Chinese Communist Party on 4 June Incident states that the use of force was necessary to control \"political turmoil\", [267] and this also ensures the stable society that is necessary for successful economic development [268] [269] [270] Chinese leaders—including Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, who were general secretaries of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party—consistently reiterated the official narrative of the Chinese Communist Party when being asked about the protests by foreign journalists [271]\n\n\nOfficial narrative\nThe official narrative constructed by the Chinese Communist Party on 4 June Incident states that the use of force was necessary to control \"political turmoil\", [267] and this also ensures the stable society that is necessary for successful economic development [268] [269] [270] Chinese leaders—including Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, who were general secretaries of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party—consistently reiterated the official narrative of the Chinese Communist Party when being asked about the protests by foreign journalists [271]\n\n\nChinese media\nThe suppression of 4 June marked the end of a period of relative press freedom in China, and media workers—both foreign and domestic—faced heightened restrictions and punishment in the aftermath of the crackdown State media reports in the immediate aftermath were sympathetic to the students As a result, those responsible were all later removed from their posts Two news anchors, Du Xian and Xue Fei, who reported this event on 4 and 5 June, respectively in the daily Xinwen Lianbo broadcast on China Central Television, were fired because they openly emoted in sympathy with the protesters Wu Xiaoyong, the son of the former foreign minister Wu Xueqian, was removed from the English Program Department of Chinese Radio International, ostensibly for his sympathies towards protesters Editors and other staff at the People's Daily, including director Qian Liren and Editor-in-Chief Tan Wenrui, were also sacked because of reports in the paper that were sympathetic towards the protesters [273]\n\n\nForeign media\nWith the imposition of martial law, the Chinese government cut off Western broadcasters' satellite transmissions such as CNN and CBS Broadcasters tried to defy these orders by reporting via telephone Video footage was smuggled out of the country, although the only network that was able to record video during the night of 4 June was Televisión Española of Spain (TVE) [277] During the military action, some foreign journalists faced harassment from authorities CBS correspondent Richard Roth and his cameraman were taken into custody while filing a report from the square via mobile phone [278]\n\n\nReactions\nThe Chinese government's response was widely denounced by Western governments and media [284] According to Suisheng Zhao, Asian countries generally remained silent throughout the protests; [285] India's government under Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi responded to the massacre by ordering the state television to offer only the absolute minimum coverage of the incident so as not to jeopardize a thawing in relations with China and to empathize with the Chinese government [286] The Communist Party of India (Marxist) was the only political party in the world to pass a resolution supporting the crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protests, calling them \"an imperialist attempt to internally subvert socialism,  [which] was successfully thwarted by the CPC and the PLA.\" [287] [288] [289] [290]\n\n\nLonger-term impact\nAs the party departed from the orthodox communism it was founded upon, much of its attention was focused on the cultivation of nationalism as an alternative ideology [293] This policy largely succeeded in tying the party's legitimacy to China's \"national pride\", turning domestic public opinion back in its favor [294]\n\n\nPolitics\nAs the party departed from the orthodox communism it was founded upon, much of its attention was focused on the cultivation of nationalism as an alternative ideology [293] This policy largely succeeded in tying the party's legitimacy to China's \"national pride\", turning domestic public opinion back in its favor [294]\n\n\nEconomy\nAfter the Tiananmen Square protests, many business analysts downgraded their outlook for China's economic future [41] The violent response to the protests was one of the factors that led to a delay in China's acceptance in the World Trade Organization, which was not completed until twelve years later, in 2001 [41] Furthermore, bilateral aid to China decreased from $3.4 billion in 1988 to $700 million in 1990 [297] Loans to China were suspended by the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and foreign governments; [298] China's credit rating was lowered; [297] tourism revenue decreased from US$2.2 billion to US$1.8 billion; and foreign direct investment commitments were canceled However, there was a rise in government defense spending from 8.6% in 1986, to 15.5% in 1990, reversing a previous 10-year decline [299]\n\n\nHong Kong\nIn Hong Kong, the Tiananmen Square protests led to fears that China would renege on its commitments under one country, two systems, following the impending handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom in 1997 In response, Governor Chris Patten tried to expand the franchise for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, which led to friction with Beijing For many Hongkongers, Tiananmen served as the turning point when they lost trust in the Beijing government The event, coupled with general uncertainty about the status of Hong Kong after the transfer of sovereignty, led to a sizable exodus of Hong Kongers to Western countries such as Canada and Australia before 1997.\n\n\nChina's image internationally\nThe Chinese government drew widespread condemnation for its suppression of the protests In the immediate aftermath, China seemed to be becoming a pariah state, increasingly isolated internationally This was a significant setback for the leadership, who had courted international investment for much of the 1980s, as the country emerged from the chaos of the Cultural Revolution; however, Deng Xiaoping and the core leadership vowed to continue economic liberalization policies after 1989 [306] From there on, China would work domestically and internationally to reshape its national image from that of a repressive regime to that of a benign global economic and military partner [307]\n\n\nEuropean Union and the United States arms embargo\nThe European Union and United States embargo on armament sales to China, put in place due to the violent suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests, remains in place today China has been calling for a lift of the ban for years and has had a varying amount of support from European Union members Since 2004, China has portrayed the ban as \"outdated\" and damaging to China–European Union relations In early 2004, French President Jacques Chirac spearheaded a movement within the European Union to lift the ban, his efforts being supported by German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder However, the passing of the Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China, in March 2005, increased tensions between mainland China and Taiwan, damaging attempts to lift the ban; and several European Union Council members retracted their support for a lift of the ban Moreover, Schröder's successor Angela Merkel opposed lifting the ban Members of the United States Congress had also proposed restrictions on the transfer of military technology to the European Union if the latter lifted the ban The United Kingdom also opposed the embargo lifting when it took charge of the European Union presidency in July 2005.\n\n\nContemporary issues\nThe Chinese government continues to forbid discussions about the Tiananmen Square protests [314] [315] and has taken measures to block or censor related information, in an attempt to suppress the public's memory of the Tiananmen Square protests [316] Textbooks contain little, if any, information about the protests [317] After the protests, officials banned controversial films and books and shut down many newspapers Within a year, 12% of all newspapers, 8% of all publishing companies, 13% of all social science periodicals, and more than 150 films were either banned or shut down The government also announced that it had seized 32 million contraband books and 2.4 million video and audio cassettes [318] Access to media and Internet resources about the subject are either restricted or blocked by censors [319] Banned literature and films include Summer Palace, [320] Forbidden City, Collection of June Fourth Poems, [citation needed] The Critical Moment: Li Peng diaries and any writings of Zhao Ziyang or his aide Bao Tong, including Zhao's memoirs.\n\n\nCensorship in China\nThe Chinese government continues to forbid discussions about the Tiananmen Square protests [314] [315] and has taken measures to block or censor related

involved in the military crackdown, published an open letter to President Hu Jintao that sought to have the government reevaluate its position on the protests He was subsequently arrested and taken from his home [335]\n\n\nChinese leaders voicing regret\nBefore his death in 1998, Yang Shangkun told army doctor Jiang Yanyong that 4 June was the most serious mistake committed by the Communist Party in its history, a mistake that Yang himself could not correct, but one that certainly will eventually be corrected [337] Zhao Ziyang remained under house arrest until his death in 2005 Zhao's aide Bao Tong has repeatedly called on the government to reverse its verdict on the demonstrations Chen Xitong, the mayor of Beijing, who read the martial law order and was later disgraced by a political scandal, expressed regret in 2012, a year before his death, for the death of innocent civilians [338] Premier Wen Jiabao reportedly suggested reversing the government's position on Tiananmen in party meetings before he departed from politics in 2013, only to be rebuffed by his colleagues [339]\n\n\nUnited Nations report\nDuring its 41st session, from 3–21 November 2008, the UN Committee Against Torture expressed concern over the lack of investigations into the reports of people \"killed, arrested or disappeared on or following the 4 June 1989 Beijing suppression.\" It stated that the Chinese government had also failed to inform relatives of those individuals' fate, despite relatives' numerous requests Meanwhile, those responsible for the use of excessive force had not \"faced any sanction, administrative or criminal.\" [340] The Committee recommended that the Chinese government should take all of those steps, plus \"offer apologies and reparation as appropriate and prosecute those found responsible for excessive use of force, torture and other ill-treatment.\" [340]\n\n\nGallery\nA few people may have been killed by random shooting on streets near the square, but all

He is the leader of the global criminal organization SPECTRE and is known for his sinister plans and clever disguises. Blofeld has been portrayed by several actors in film and television adaptations, and his character has become a cultural icon in popular fiction.\n\n**Character**\n\nAccording to the novel \"Thunderball\", Blofeld was born on 28 May 1908 in Gdynia, Poland, to a Polish father and a Greek mother, Maria Stavro Michelopoulos. He became a Polish national after World War I and studied at the University of Warsaw, graduating with a degree in Political History and Economics, and later from the Warsaw University of Technology with a degree in Engineering and Radionics. Blofeld was hired by the Polish Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs and appointed to a sensitive communication position, which he used for buying and selling stocks at the Warsaw Stock Exchange.\n\nBlofeld is described as a massive man, weighing roughly 20 stone (280 lbs, 127 kg), with black crew-cut hair, black eyes, heavy eyelashes, a thin mouth, and long pointed hands and feet. He has violet-scented breath from chewing flavored cachous (breath mints), a habit he adopts whenever he must deliver bad news. Blofeld is a meticulous planner of formidable intellect, seemingly without conscience but not necessarily insane, and is motivated solely by financial gain.\n\n**In Novels**\n\nBlofeld has three appearances in Ian Fleming's novels. He first appears in a minor role as the leader of SPECTRE in the 1961 novel \"Thunderball\". The plot that he formulates is carried out by his second-in-command, Emilio Largo. Blofeld is described as a massive man with a commanding presence, and his plans are often sinister and complex.\n\nIn the novel \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\", Blofeld appears as the main antagonist, and his character is further developed. He is shown to be a cunning and ruthless individual who will stop at nothing to achieve his goals.\n\n**In Films**\n\nBlofeld's depiction in film has influenced the portrayal of supervillains and Mafia bosses in popular fiction. Since his first appearance on the big screen in 1963, he has established some \"standards\" imitated for decades, such as mysterious identities, being portrayed stroking a pet, and the concept of spectacularly executing underlings who fail to defeat the main protagonist.\n\nIn the film series, Blofeld first appears in \"From Russia with Love\" (credited as \"Ernst Blofeld\", though the name is never heard), then in \"Thunderball\" (uncredited). In these two appearances, his name is never spoken, his face is not seen, and only his lower body is visible as he strokes his trademark white cat.\n\n**Rebooted Continuity**\n\nBy November 2013, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and the McClory estate had formally settled the issue with Danjaq and MGM and acquired the full copyright to the characters and concepts of Blofeld and SPECTRE. Blofeld consequently reappeared in \"Spectre\", played by Christoph Waltz, and with a new background. In this continuity, he was born Franz Oberhauser, the son of Hannes Oberhauser, a character from the original short story \"Octopussy\", and James Bond's (Daniel Craig) legal guardian after being orphaned at the age of 11. This makes him and Bond adoptive brothers.\n\n**Table of Film Appearances**\n\nBlofeld appears in the following films:\n\n* \"From Russia with Love\" (1963) - credited as \"Ernst Blofeld\", though the name is never heard\n* \"Thunderball\" (1965) - uncredited\n* \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" (1969) - played by Telly Savalas\n* \"Diamonds Are Forever\" (1971) - played by Charles Gray\n* \"For Your Eyes Only\" (1981) - played by Carl Rigg\n* \"Spectre\" (2015) - played by Christoph Waltz\n\n**Comic Books**\n\nIn the James Bond comic books by Dynamite Entertainment, Blofeld appears as the main antagonist in the \"Agent of SPECTRE\" arc, which ran between March and July 2021. As in the original Ian Fleming novels, he is the son of a Polish father and a Greek mother; his mother belonged to a family of Greek ship-owners, with Blofeld inheriting a private fleet from her, which he manages to build up into a global shipping empire. His base of operations is the (fictional) Greek island of Meraki. Behind his veneer of respectability as a shipping billionaire, Blofeld is the leader of the resuscitated SPECTRE global criminal organization, which had been thought dismantled since the end of the Cold War.\n\n**Video Games**\n\nBlofeld appears in the end of the 2004 video game \"GoldenEye: Rogue Agent\", with the likeness of Donald Pleasence, voiced by Gideon Emery. Despite the character being clearly him, as chief of an anonymous but powerful crime syndicate, he is not named because of the then-ongoing copyright controversy that also prevented the open usage of the character in the Moore era films.\n\n**Homages**\n\nSome of Blofeld's characteristics have become supervillain tropes in popular fiction and media, including the parodies Dr Claw (and his pet cat, M.A.D Cat) from the Inspector Gadget animated series (1983-1986), Team Rocket leader Giovanni and his Persian from the Pokémon television series, and Dr Evil (and his cat Mr Bigglesworth) from the Austin Powers film series (1997-2002). The 1999 \"The Powerpuff Girls\" episode \"Cat Man Do\" also features a supervillain with a cat, though it is the feline that turns out to be the criminal mastermind. In \"The Penguins of Madagascar\", the recurring villain Dr Blowhole is a parody and homage to Blofeld. The rendition for Lex Luthor in \"Superman: The Animated Series\", and to a certain extent, various entries of the DC Animated Universe, were derived in part from Telly Savalas' portrayal of Blofeld in \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\".

his mother belonged to a family of Greek ship-owners, with Blofeld inheriting a private fleet from her, which he manages to build up into a global shipping empire His base of operations is the (fictional) Greek island of Meraki [18] Behind his veneer of respectability as a shipping billionaire, Blofeld is the leader of the resuscitated SPECTRE global criminal organisation, which had been thought dismantled since the end of the Cold War.\n\n\nComic books\nIn the James Bond comic books by Dynamite Entertainment, Blofeld appears as the main antagonist in the Agent of SPECTRE arc, which ran between March and July 2021 As in the original Ian Fleming novels, he is the son of a Polish father and a Greek mother;

However, the event was widely criticized by attendees and was eventually canceled. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the event, including its background, script, event details, customer response, fundraising efforts, and impact on popular culture.\n\n**Background**\n\nWilly's Chocolate Experience was stated to take place over the weekend of 24-25 February 2024. Promotional material advertised \"stunning and intricately designed settings inspired by Roald Dahl's timeless tale\" and \"an array of delectable treats scattered throughout the experience.\" However, the event's website and promotional material used AI-generated images, which included several spelling errors and nonsensical words. Tickets cost up to £35 (approximately $45 USD) per person.\n\nAs the event was being promoted in early February, a Reddit user who saw Facebook adverts suspected it to be a scam and was surprised that people were apparently buying tickets based solely on AI-generated images. Despite these concerns, many people purchased tickets, and the event was eventually held at the Box Hub Warehouse event space in Whiteinch, an industrial area of Glasgow.\n\n**Script**\n\nThe script for the event, titled \"Wonkidoodles at McDuff's Chocolate Factory: A Script,\" described McDuff leading an audience through the Garden of Enchantment and the Twilight Tunnel. Once there, they were confronted by a character called \"The Unknown,\" described as \"an evil chocolate maker who lives in the walls\" who sought to steal the magical \"Anti-Graffiti Gobstopper\" from McDuff's Imagination Lab. The gobstopper was \"a sweet so powerful, it can make any room sparkle without lifting a finger.\"\n\nMcDuff defeats The Unknown by amplifying the power of the gobstopper and causing his enemy to be \"gently swept up by a robotic vacuum, humorously ending the confrontation.\" The script was described as being poorly written and lacking coherence, which may have contributed to the event's overall negative experience.\n\n**Event**\n\nThe event was held at the Box Hub Warehouse event space in Whiteinch, which was described as \"little more than an abandoned, empty warehouse.\" The venue's set dressings included a small bouncy castle, AI-generated backdrop images pinned to some of the walls, and props which were \"strewn about on bare concrete floors.\" The venue's windows were dirty, and its air conditioning systems were left exposed.\n\nAttendees described the venue as being poorly maintained and lacking any semblance of a cohesive experience. Despite these concerns, the event's organizers, including Paterson and Fogarty, chose to proceed with the work, stating that they had already signed their contracts and didn't want to disappoint the kids.\n\n**Customer Response**\n\nWilly's Chocolate Experience was widely criticized by those who attended it, with many demanding refunds. One customer, who had driven with his children for two hours to reach the event, described it as an \"absolute con.\" Other visitors who arrived after the event was closed and were not informed of its cancellation requested compensation for wasted rail fares.\n\nFollowing the event's cancellation, Coull offered to refund 850 people, a statement repeated by the event's Facebook page. However, some Facebook users stated that they had received their money back, while Paterson and Fogarty would later state that they had received half of the £500 due to them.\n\n**Fundraising**\n\nIn an interview with Wired magazine, Connell stated that he and the other actors were working with parents to provide a free show for the children who attended. This effort was seen as a positive step towards making amends for the event's poor experience.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nA picture of a dispirited Paterson playing a Wonkidoodle in the \"Jellybean Room\" (in reality, a table covered in chemistry equipment) became a popular depiction of the event. The image was compared to a picture of a \"meth lab\" and to Édouard Manet's 1882 painting A Bar at the Folies-Bergère, which depicts \"an alienated woman at work.\" The character of \"The Unknown\" was also featured in several memes, with some Twitter users expressing plans to dress up as the character for Halloween.\n\nThe event was spoofed on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in April 2024 in a skit called \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Part Two,\" featuring Freddie Highmore, who had played Charlie Bucket in the 2005 film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The skit was a humorous take on the event's poor experience and lack of cohesion.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Willy's_Chocolate_Experience\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nThe event was stated to take place over the weekend of 24–25 February 2024 [2] Promotional material advertised \"stunning and intricately designed settings inspired by Roald Dahl's timeless tale\" and \"an array of delectable treats scattered throughout the experience\" [9] Both the website and promotional material used AI-generated images, which included several spelling errors such as \"cartchy tuns\" and \"a pasadise of sweet teats\" and nonsensical words such as \"catgacating\" [10] [11] [12] Tickets cost up to £35 (US$45) per person [3] [5] While the event was being promoted in early February, a Reddit user who saw Facebook adverts suspected it to be a scam and was surprised that people were apparently buying tickets based solely on AI-generated images [12]\n\n\nScript\nThe script for the event is titled Wonkidoodles at McDuff's Chocolate Factory: A Script, and describes McDuff leading an audience through the Garden of Enchantment and the Twilight Tunnel [19] Once there, they are confronted by a character called The Unknown, described as \"an evil chocolate maker who lives in the walls\" who seeks to steal the magical \"Anti-Graffiti Gobstopper\" from McDuff's Imagination Lab The gobstopper is \"a sweet so powerful, it can make any room sparkle without lifting a finger\" [19] [20] McDuff defeats The Unknown by amplifying the power of the gobstopper and causing his enemy to be \"gently swept up by a robotic vacuum, humorously ending the confrontation\" [15] [19]\n\n\nEvent\nThe event was held at the Box Hub Warehouse event space in Whiteinch, an industrial area of Glasgow [2] [4] Customers described the venue as \"little more than an abandoned, empty warehouse\", [5] with set dressings including a small bouncy castle, AI-generated backdrop images pinned to some of the walls, [22] and props which were \"strewn about on bare concrete floors\" The venue's windows were dirty and its air conditioning systems were left exposed [23] Paterson has stated that by the time she saw the venue, she had already signed her contract and \"didn't want to disappoint the kids\", and thus chose to proceed with the work [12]\n\n\nCustomer response\nWilly's Chocolate Experience was widely criticised by those who attended it, with many demanding refunds [27] One customer, who had driven with his children for two hours to reach the event, described it as an \"absolute con\" [23] Other visitors who arrived after the event was closed and were not informed of its cancellation requested compensation for wasted rail fares [4] Following the event's cancellation, Coull offered to refund 850 people, [27] a statement repeated by the event's Facebook page, with some Facebook users stating that they had received their money back [13] Paterson and Fogarty would later state that they had received half of the £500 due to them [18]\n\n\nFundraising\nIn an interview with Wired magazine, Connell stated that he and the other actors were working with parents to provide a free show for the children who attended [15]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nA picture of a dispirited Paterson playing a Wonkidoodle in the \"Jellybean Room\" (in reality, a table covered in chemistry equipment) became a popular depiction of the event [1] [5] [15] The image became a meme and was compared to a picture of a \"meth lab\" [1] [15] and to Édouard Manet's 1882 painting A Bar at the Folies-Bergère, which depicts \"an alienated woman at work\" [32] The character of \"The Unknown\" was also featured in several memes Some Twitter users expressed plans to dress up as the character for Halloween [33] The event was spoofed on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in April 2024 in a skit called \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Part Two\", featuring Freddie Highmore, who had played Charlie Bucket in the 2005 film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory [34]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
