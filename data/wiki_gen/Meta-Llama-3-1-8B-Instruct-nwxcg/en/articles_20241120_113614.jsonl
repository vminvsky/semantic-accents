He is best known for creating the McAfee antivirus software, which was one of the first commercial antivirus programs to be widely used. McAfee has also been involved in various other business ventures and has been a prominent figure in the libertarian movement.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJohn McAfee was born on September 18, 1945, on a U.S. Army base in Cinderford, Gloucestershire, England. His father, Don McAfee, was an American serving in the military, and his mother, Joan Williams, was British. McAfee has stated that he felt as much British as American, despite being raised primarily in Salem, Virginia. His father was an abusive alcoholic, and McAfee has said that he struggled to make sense of his father's behavior.\n\nMcAfee's childhood was marked by fear and uncertainty. His father's abuse was a constant presence, and McAfee has said that he often felt like he was walking on eggshells around him. When McAfee was 15, his father killed himself with a gun. McAfee has stated that he may have shot and killed his father, staging the scene to look like a suicide. This event had a profound impact on McAfee's life and has been the subject of much speculation and debate.\n\n**Ventures**\n\nMcAfee began his career in the 1960s as a programmer for NASA. He later worked at Univac as a software designer and at Xerox as an operating system architect. In the 1970s, he joined Computer Sciences Corporation as a software consultant and worked for Booz Allen Hamilton from 1980 to 1982. In 1986, while working for Lockheed, McAfee read about the Brain computer virus and became terrified. Sensing a business opportunity, he created an antivirus software that could detect and remove the virus automatically.\n\nIn 1987, McAfee created McAfee Associates Inc. to sell his antivirus software, which he named VirusScan. This was the first anti-virus software to be brought to market, and it quickly gained popularity. McAfee's company was incorporated in Delaware in 1992, and it had its initial public offering the same year. In 1993, McAfee stepped down as CEO and remained with the company as chief technical officer.\n\n**McAfee Associates**\n\nInitially, McAfee did not seek a large userbase of paying customers. Instead, he wanted to raise awareness of the need to be protected from computer viruses. However, by making people fear such malware, he managed to generate millions of sales. By 1990, McAfee was making $5 million a year. In 1994, he sold his remaining stake in the company and had no further involvement in its operations.\n\n**PowWow, QuoromEx, MGT and More**\n\nIn 1994, McAfee founded the company Tribal Voice, which developed one of the first instant messaging programs, PowWow. He also founded the company QuoromEx, where he was involved in various business ventures. McAfee has been involved in a number of other companies and projects over the years, including MGT, a company that developed a line of antivirus software.\n\n**Politics**\n\nMcAfee has been a libertarian for many years and has been involved in various libertarian organizations. He has advocated for the decriminalization of cannabis, an end to the war on drugs, non-interventionism in foreign policy, and a free market economy. He has also supported abolishing the Transportation Security Administration.\n\n**2016 Presidential Campaign**\n\nOn September 8, 2015, McAfee announced his bid for president of the United States in the 2016 presidential election. He ran as the candidate of the Cyber Party, a newly formed political party. On December 24, 2015, he re-announced his candidacy bid, this time seeking the presidential nomination of the Libertarian Party. McAfee consistently polled alongside the party's other top candidates, including Gary Johnson and Austin Petersen.\n\n**Notable Endorsements**\n\nIn 2018, McAfee tweeted that he would run for president again in 2020, either with the Libertarian Party or a separate party that he would create. He later chose to run as a Libertarian and mainly campaigned for wider cryptocurrency use.\n\n**2020 Presidential Campaign**\n\nMcAfee ran for president again in 2020, this time as a Libertarian. He mainly campaigned for wider cryptocurrency use and other libertarian issues.\n\n**Legal Issues**\n\nIn 2008, McAfee was named a defendant in a civil court case related to his Aerotrekking light-sport aircraft venture and the death of his nephew, Joel Bitow, and a passenger.\n\n**Death of Gregory Faull**\n\nOn November 12, 2012, Belize police began to search for McAfee as a person of interest in connection with the homicide investigation of American immigrant Gregory Viant Faull. Faull was found dead of a gunshot wound at his home on the island of Ambergris Caye, the largest island in Belize. McAfee fled Belize rather than cooperate with the police investigation.\n\n**U.S. Tax Evasion Charges and Planned Extradition**\n\nIn January 2019, McAfee announced that he was on the run from U.S. authorities, living internationally on a boat. He was facing tax evasion charges, and a grand jury had been convened to indict him, his wife, and four of his 2020 Libertarian Party presidential primaries staff.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nMcAfee has been married three times. His first wife, Fran, was an 18-year-old undergraduate student when he met her, and their affair led to his expulsion from college. His second wife, Judy, was a former flight attendant at American Airlines, and they divorced in 2002.\n\n**Death**\n\nOn June 23, 2021, McAfee was found dead in his prison cell, hours after the Spanish National Court ordered his extradition to the United States on criminal charges filed in Tennessee by the United States Department of Justice Tax Division.

Madness over disputes about the film's artistic direction [6] [7]\n\n\nCasting\nAgents scouted hundreds of child actors for The Black Phone's starring roles [10] They ultimately hired Mason Thames and Madeleine McGraw as the first significant casting choices, [11] [12] from auditions conducted on Zoom as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic [5] [13] McGraw was considered among four actresses, and when a prior commitment to Disney's television series Secrets of Sulphur Springs forced her to pull out, the producers postponed filming of The Black Phone by several months to accommodate her schedule [5] [14] Casting for Finney was not as immediate of an undertaking It took months for the filmmakers to survey the actors—first through talent agencies in New York and Los Angeles, then an open call—before they were shown Thames's demo reels [14] Even though Thames lacked acting experience, The Black Phone being his film debut, he reportedly stood apart from others in his ability to emote and take direction [14] Due to the amount of violence and profanity in the script, Derrickson carefully broached the subject to Thames, McGraw, and their parents in preparation for scenes [4] [15]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on February 9, 2021 in Wilmington, North Carolina, under the pseudonym Static [21] [22] A private residence used for interior and exterior shots was the shoot's initial location [23] The production base was confined mostly to EUE/Screen Gems's local film studio, from sets portraying The Grabber's basement, and adjacent neighborhoods [24] Estimates to realize the shoot ran between $16–18 million, [25] [26] the budget partially funded by a $4.7 million transferable tax credit on in-state costs from the North Carolina government [23] Elsewhere regionally, shooting occurred in New Hanover, Brunswick, and Columbus counties [27] Filming for The Black Phone ended on March 27, 2021 [28]\n\n\nVisual effects\nVFX Legion was responsible for The Black Phone's visual effects, in their second project with Derrickson [30] Development of the visual effects began in pre-production, under the supervision of VFX Legion co-founders James David Hattin and Nate Smalley Their work for the film comprised 200 shots of matte and digital compositing effects, such as green screening, set extensions, superimposed practical stunt effects, camera transitions, computer-generated imagery (CGI), and rig removal [30] Maya, Nuke, Houdini, and Redshift were among the software used to handle rendering and animation tasks VFX Legion was also present on set to critique the shoot and rectify problems with the filmmaking [30]\n\n\nMasks\nDesigning The Grabber's masks became a core goal, in part because Blumhouse Productions planned to showcase them in ads for the film [31] While the script detailed a prototype of two worn leather masks painted with a smiling and a frowning devil, this concept evolved when Derrickson proposed the addition of a mouthless mask They convey despair, joy, and nihility in exaggerated form, reminiscent of tragic comic masks of ancient Greek theatre [32] Derrickson and Blumhouse producer Ryan Turek solicited five visual effects companies for the mask-making, including Callosum Studios, a Pittsburgh-based studio founded by prosthetic makeup artists Jason Baker and Tom Savini [31] [32] [33] Of the illustrations submitted, Callosum's most closely resembled the vision of the producers Savini and Baker were engaged to handle the creation of up to 30 masks for gags, stunts, specific scenes, and pandemic mitigation, in a process that lasted a month The approval of sketches took about two weeks, followed by the construction of pieces in about a day or two [32] The filmmakers drew on diverse material for reference, among them ceramic masks, circus masks, antique dolls, William Hickey's Coney Island Barker, the horror film Mr Sardonicus (1961), and the exaggerated grin of Conrad Veidt's Gwynplaine in the silent film The Man Who Laughs (1928) [31] [32]\n\n\nMusic\nThe Black Phone came to composer Mark Korven's attention once his agent and Blumhouse had correspondence Derrickson outlined the film's pastiche musical approach in early conversations, calling for a score drawing on modern and vintage synthesizer-heavy sounds [34] Korven's objective was to tie together the music and subtext, chiefly themes of fear, confinement, and the perils of the human condition, to highlight The Grabber [34] [35] He developed The Grabber's character motifs with abrasive strings accompaniments and friction noise produced from rubbing mallets on rough surfaces [34] The other characters were of minor focus except for \"lighter, more feminine\" tones for Gwen-centric scenes and a strings arrangement that accompanied the film's resolution [34] [35]\n\n\nRelease\nThe Black Phone premiered at Fantastic Fest on September 25, 2021 [36] The film screened at the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica for the 9th Beyond Fest that October and, in the next year, headlined New Orleans' Overlook Film Festival as the event's closing title [37] [38] It finished its festival itinerary at the 2022 Tribeca Festival, part of the fest's late-night lineup [39] Universal Pictures released The Black Phone in US theaters on June 24, 2022, [40] after delaying the film twice from its scheduled early 2022 release [41] [42] The studio's marketing campaign promoted the viewing experience rather than the film's actors or story elements [43] They began the promotional cycle in August 2021 with a trade show exhibit at CinemaCon, where the first teaser trailer debuted [44] [45] The official trailer was released in October 2021 [46] Derrickson unveiled the theatrical release poster in conjunction with The Black Phone's Fantastic Fest premiere, sporting the tagline, \"Never talk to strangers.\" [47]\n\n\nReception\nThe Black Phone was considered a surprise box office success, as studios anticipated meager profits for theaters screening lower-budget films, closed as a consequence of COVID-19 pandemic control measures [54] The film finished its theatrical run grossing $90.1 million in the United States and Canada (55.8% of its earnings) and $71.3 million internationally (44.2%), for a global total of $161.4 million [55] Of this figure, $67.8 million was estimated to have been yielded by Blumhouse and Universal in net profit, factoring in advertising, production, interest, administrative overhead, residuals, and miscellaneous costs [56]\n\n\nBox office\nThe Black Phone was considered

The Grabber takes Finney and Gwen to his basement, where he keeps the bodies of his previous victims. Finney soon discovers that the only way to survive is to use a black phone that allows him to communicate with the outside world. However, The Grabber has a twisted game in mind, and Finney must use his wits to outsmart him and escape.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe Black Phone emerged from filmmakers Scott Derrickson and C. Robert Cargill's adaptation of Joe Hill's short story of the same name, published in the horror anthology 20th Century Ghosts (2005). Derrickson came across 20th Century Ghosts shortly after its initial US release. The director was eager to conceive a film faithful to \"The Black Phone\", which fascinated him in its framing of a conventional serial killer story, but struggled to produce ideas of his own devising. He shelved the project to focus on his professional relationship with Cargill, forged from Sinister (2012), and his contractual obligations to Marvel Studios as director of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022).\n\nCargill briefly pitched for a replacement director in the interim, stopping once Derrickson convinced him to wait until he was available to commit. Their collaboration resumed after Derrickson resigned from Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness over disputes about the film's artistic direction.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe film's casting process was extensive, with agents scouting hundreds of child actors for the starring roles. Mason Thames and Madeleine McGraw were ultimately hired as the first significant casting choices, from auditions conducted on Zoom due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. McGraw was considered among four actresses, and when a prior commitment to Disney's television series Secrets of Sulphur Springs forced her to pull out, the producers postponed filming of The Black Phone by several months to accommodate her schedule.\n\nCasting for Finney was not as immediate of an undertaking. It took months for the filmmakers to survey the actors—first through talent agencies in New York and Los Angeles, then an open call—before they were shown Thames's demo reels. Even though Thames lacked acting experience, The Black Phone being his film debut, he reportedly stood apart from others in his ability to emote and take direction.\n\nDue to the amount of violence and profanity in the script, Derrickson carefully broached the subject to Thames, McGraw, and their parents in preparation for scenes.\n\n**Filming**\n\nPrincipal photography began on February 9, 2021, in Wilmington, North Carolina, under the pseudonym Static. A private residence used for interior and exterior shots was the shoot's initial location. The production base was confined mostly to EUE/Screen Gems's local film studio, from sets portraying The Grabber's basement, and adjacent neighborhoods.\n\nEstimates to realize the shoot ran between $16–18 million, with the budget partially funded by a $4.7 million transferable tax credit on in-state costs from the North Carolina government. Elsewhere regionally, shooting occurred in New Hanover, Brunswick, and Columbus counties.\n\nFilming for The Black Phone ended on March 27, 2021.\n\n**Visual Effects**\n\nVFX Legion was responsible for The Black Phone's visual effects, in their second project with Derrickson. Development of the visual effects began in pre-production, under the supervision of VFX Legion co-founders James David Hattin and Nate Smalley. Their work for the film comprised 200 shots of matte and digital compositing effects, such as green screening, set extensions, superimposed practical stunt effects, camera transitions, computer-generated imagery (CGI), and rig removal.\n\nMaya, Nuke, Houdini, and Redshift were among the software used to handle rendering and animation tasks. VFX Legion was also present on set to critique the shoot and rectify problems with the filmmaking.\n\n**Masks**\n\nDesigning The Grabber's masks became a core goal, in part because Blumhouse Productions planned to showcase them in ads for the film. While the script detailed a prototype of two worn leather masks painted with a smiling and a frowning devil, this concept evolved when Derrickson proposed the addition of a mouthless mask.\n\nThey convey despair, joy, and nihility in exaggerated form, reminiscent of tragic comic masks of ancient Greek theatre. Derrickson and Blumhouse producer Ryan Turek solicited five visual effects companies for the mask-making, including Callosum Studios, a Pittsburgh-based studio founded by prosthetic makeup artists Jason Baker and Tom Savini.\n\nOf the illustrations submitted, Callosum's most closely resembled the vision of the producers. Savini and Baker were engaged to handle the creation of up to 30 masks for gags, stunts, specific scenes, and pandemic mitigation, in a process that lasted a month. The approval of sketches took about two weeks, followed by the construction of pieces in about a day or two.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe Black Phone came to composer Mark Korven's attention once his agent and Blumhouse had correspondence. Derrickson outlined the film's pastiche musical approach in early conversations, calling for a score drawing on modern and vintage synthesizer-heavy sounds.\n\nKorven's objective was to tie together the music and subtext, chiefly themes of fear, confinement, and the perils of the human condition, to highlight The Grabber. He developed The Grabber's character motifs with abrasive strings accompaniments and friction noise produced from rubbing mallets on rough surfaces.\n\nThe other characters were of minor focus except for \"lighter, more feminine\" tones for Gwen-centric scenes and a strings arrangement that accompanied the film's resolution.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe Black Phone premiered at Fantastic Fest on September 25, 2021. The film screened at the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica for the 9th Beyond Fest that October and, in the next year, headlined New Orleans' Overlook Film Festival as the event's closing title.\n\nIt finished its festival itinerary at the 2022 Tribeca Festival, part of the fest's late-night lineup. Universal Pictures released The Black Phone in US theaters on June 24, 2022, after delaying the film twice from its scheduled early 2022 release.\n\nThe studio's marketing campaign promoted the viewing experience rather than the film's actors or story elements. They began the promotional cycle in August 2021 with a trade show exhibit at CinemaCon, where the first teaser trailer debuted.\n\nThe official trailer was released in October 2021. Derrickson unveiled the theatrical release poster in conjunction with The Black Phone's Fantastic Fest premiere, sporting the tagline, \"Never talk to strangers.\"\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe Black Phone was considered a surprise box office success, as studios anticipated meager profits for theaters screening lower-budget films, closed as a consequence of COVID-19 pandemic control measures.\n\nThe film finished its theatrical run grossing $90.1 million in the United States and Canada (55.8% of its earnings) and $71.3 million internationally (44.2%), for a global total of $161.4 million. Of this figure, $67.8 million was estimated to have been yielded by Blumhouse and Universal in net profit, factoring in advertising, production, interest, administrative overhead, residuals, and miscellaneous costs.\n\n**Critical Response**\n\nThe Black Phone opened to mostly favorable reviews. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 81% of 264 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.0/10. The website's consensus reads: \"The Black Phone might have been even more frightening, but it remains an entertaining, well-acted adaptation of scarily good source material.\"\n\nMetacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 65 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nHill pitched Derrickson follow-up ideas examining The Black Phone characters as early as June 2022. Derrickson discussed the possibility of a sequel further while embarking on the press tour for The Black Phone.\n\nThe film's success led to immediate negotiations that August, and by October 2023, Universal commissioned The Black Phone 2 with a scheduled release date of June 27, 2025. Derrickson and Cargill will resume their screenwriting duties, while Hawke, Thames, McGraw, Davies, and Mora are expected to reprise their roles.\n\nIn May 2024, Universal postponed The Black Phone 2's theatrical release by four months, to October 17, 2025, after commissioning several new Blumhouse films for the calendar year.\n\n**Sequel and Related Media**\n\nHill pitched Derrickson follow-up ideas examining The Black Phone characters as early as June 2022.

costume preserves the color scheme and \"S\" logo, but adopts darker tones, and notably does not feature the red trunks usually worn by Superman Zack Snyder said the costume is \"a modern aesthetic\" He and the producers attempted to devise a suit featuring the red trunks, but could not design one that fit into the tone of the film, leading to their removal from the suit [110] Because of Wilkinson's unavailability, Snyder chose Acheson to design the suit; however, he only started developing it, and Wilkinson finished the development when he returned, and designed the other character's costumes as well [111] Due to the substantial weight a practical suit would yield, the Kryptonian armor for General Zod was constructed through CGI to allow Shannon \"freedom of movement\" [112] In a March 2014 interview with Esquire, Wilkinson explained the reason for the look of Superman's redesigned suit:\n\n\nEffects\nJohn \"DJ\" Desjardin served as the visual supervisor for Man of Steel, with Weta Digital, MPC and Double Negative providing the visual effects for the film [113] [114] Zack Snyder wanted the film to \"appear very natural because there's some very fantastical things in there and he wanted people to suspend their disbelief, and we the visual effects team had to make it as easy as possible for them to do so.\" Desjardin noted that the intent in shooting the film was to use handheld devices to make the film feel like a \"documentary-style\" film Desjardin said: \"We had to think about what that would mean, since we also had to photograph some crazy action So for a lot of the previs we did, we'd start to think where our cameras were and where our cameraman was A lot of the rules are the Battlestar Galactica rules for the space cams that Gary Hurtzel  [sic] developed

Going to Do When You Are Not Saving the World?\", was released on April 19 [120] In late April, the official track listing of the two-CD deluxe edition was revealed [121]\n\n\nThemes\nMany reviewers interpreted Man of Steel as a religious allegory, especially since Warner Bros set up a website that contains \"a nine-page pamphlet entitled Jesus: The Original Superhero\" [122] [123] Justin Craig compares Kal-El's struggle to the Passion of Christ, stating that \"Kal-El is more than willing to sacrifice himself to save the people of Earth Originally reluctant to reveal his identity and powers to the world, Superman decides to turn himself over to Zod to save humanity from annihilation.\" [124] Craig also states that there is an allegory to the Trinity within Man of Steel: \"Jor-El returns to Kal-El on Earth as a ghost, guiding his budding superhero son on his journey to salvation Before Jor-El sends his son off to Earth baby Moses-style, he tells his wife that, like Jesus, 'He'll be a god to them.'\" [124] Paul Asay of The Washington Post writes that \"Superman floats in space with his arms splayed out as if nailed to an invisible cross,\" a fact that Craig also mentioned in his assessment of the film [125] [124] The protagonist of the film is also 33 years old and seeks \"counsel at a church.\" [126]\n\n\nMarketing\nWarner Bros and DC Comics won the rights to the domain name

film directed by Zack Snyder, produced by Christopher Nolan, and written by David S. Goyer. The film is a reboot of the Superman film series and stars Henry Cavill as the iconic superhero. The film follows the story of Kal-El, an alien sent to Earth as a child, who grows up to become Superman, an iconic superhero with exceptional strength, speed, and the ability to fly. The film explores Kal-El's origin story, his struggles with his Kryptonian heritage, and his battles against General Zod and his followers.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe planet Krypton is destabilizing from the mining of the planetary core. Just before the planet explodes, Krypton's top scientist, Jor-El, steals and infuses the genetics codex into his new-born son, Kal-El, the first naturally born Kryptonian in centuries. Jor-El manages to send Kal-El in a spacecraft toward Earth before being killed by General Zod during a coup d'état.\n\nKal-El, also known as Clark Kent, grows up on Earth, where he is adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent.

She attended the Chapin School in Manhattan and later enrolled at the University of Arizona, where she studied art history.\n\nCareer\n--------\n\nIn the early 1960s, Eastman began her career as a receptionist and editorial assistant for Town & Country magazine.

Christian, however, is shy and struggles to express his feelings to Roxanne. This is where the clever and charming Cyrano de Bergerac, played by Peter Dinklage, comes into the picture. Cyrano, who is a childhood friend of Roxanne's, offers to help Christian woo Roxanne by writing letters and poems on his behalf.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Cyrano's clever words and wit become the key to winning Roxanne's heart.

{"title": "Vlad_the_Impaler", "content": "\nName\nThe name Dracula, which is now primarily known as the name of a vampire, was for centuries known as the sobriquet of Vlad III [7] [8] Diplomatic reports and popular stories referred to him as Dracula, Dracuglia, or Drakula already in the 15th century [7] He himself signed his two letters as \"Dragulya\" or \"Drakulya\" in the late 1470s [9] His name had its origin in the sobriquet of his father, Vlad Dracul (\"Vlad the Dragon\" in medieval Romanian), who received it after he became a member of the Order of the Dragon [10] [11] Dracula is the Slavonic genitive form of Dracul, meaning \" [the son] of Dracul (or the Dragon)\" [11] [12] In modern Romanian, dracul means \"the devil\", which contributed to Vlad's reputation [12]\n\n\nEarly life\nVlad was the second legitimate son of Vlad II Dracul, who was himself an illegitimate son of Mircea I of Wallachia Vlad II had won the moniker \"Dracul\" for his membership in the Order of the Dragon, a militant fraternity founded by Sigismund of Luxemburg, King of Hungary The Order of the Dragon was dedicated to halting the Ottoman advance into Europe [14] Since he was old enough to be a candidate for the throne of Wallachia in 1448, Vlad's time of birth would have been between 1428 and 1431 [15] [14] Vlad was most probably born after his father settled in Transylvania in 1429 [16] [14] Historian Radu Florescu writes that Vlad was born in the Transylvanian Saxon town of Sighișoara (then in the Kingdom of Hungary), where his father lived in a three-story stone house from 1431 to 1435 [17] Modern historians identify Vlad's mother either as a daughter or kinswoman of Alexander I of Moldavia [14] [17] [18] or as his father's unknown first wife [19]\n\n\nReigns\nUpon the death of his father and elder brother, Vlad became a potential claimant to Wallachia [19] Vladislav II of Wallachia accompanied John Hunyadi, who launched a campaign against the Ottoman Empire in September 1448 [31] [32] Taking advantage of his opponent's absence, Vlad broke into Wallachia at the head of an Ottoman army in early October [31] [32] He had to accept that the Ottomans had captured the fortress of Giurgiu on the Danube and strengthened it [33]\n\n\nFirst rule\nUpon the death of his father and elder brother, Vlad became a potential claimant to Wallachia [19] Vladislav II of Wallachia accompanied John Hunyadi, who launched a campaign against the Ottoman Empire in September 1448 [31] [32] Taking advantage of his opponent's absence, Vlad broke into Wallachia at the head of an Ottoman army in early October [31] [32] He had to accept that the Ottomans had captured the fortress of Giurgiu on the Danube and strengthened it [33]\n\n\nIn exile\nVlad first settled in Edirne in the Ottoman Empire after his fall [36] [37] Not long after, he moved to Moldavia, where Bogdan II (his father's brother-in-law and possibly his maternal uncle) had mounted the throne with John Hunyadi's support in the autumn of 1449 [36] [37] After Bogdan was murdered by Peter III Aaron in October 1451, Bogdan's son, Stephen, fled to Transylvania with Vlad to seek assistance from Hunyadi [36] [38] However, Hunyadi concluded a three-year truce with the Ottoman Empire on 20 November 1451, [39] acknowledging the Wallachian boyars' right to elect the successor of Vladislav II if he died [38]\n\n\nSecond rule\nThe circumstances and the date of Vlad's return to Wallachia are uncertain [42] He invaded Wallachia with Hungarian support either in April, July or August 1456 [43] [44] Vladislav II died during the invasion [44] Vlad sent his first extant letter as voivode of Wallachia to the burghers of Brașov on 10 September [43] He promised to protect them in case of an Ottoman invasion of Transylvania, but he also sought their assistance if the Ottomans occupied Wallachia [43] In the same letter, he stated that \"when a man or a prince is strong and powerful he can make peace as he wants to; but when he is weak, a stronger one will come and do what he wants to him\", [45] showing his authoritarian personality [43]\n\n\nConsolidation\nThe circumstances and the date of Vlad's return to Wallachia are uncertain [42] He invaded Wallachia with Hungarian support either in April, July or August 1456 [43] [44] Vladislav II died during the invasion [44] Vlad sent his first extant letter as voivode of Wallachia to the burghers of Brașov on 10 September [43] He promised to protect them in case of an Ottoman invasion of Transylvania, but he also sought their assistance if the Ottomans occupied Wallachia [43] In the same letter, he stated that \"when a man or a prince is strong and powerful he can make peace as he wants to; but when he is weak, a stronger one will come and do what he wants to him\", [45] showing his authoritarian personality [43]\n\n\nConflict with the Saxons\nVlad sent the customary tribute to the sultan [49] After John Hunyadi died on 11 August 1456, his elder son, Ladislaus Hunyadi became the captain-general of Hungary [50] He accused Vlad of having \"no intention of remaining faithful\" to the king of Hungary in a letter to the burghers of Brașov, also ordering them to support Vladislaus II's brother, Dan III, against Vlad [43] [51] The burghers of Sibiu supported another pretender, a “priest of the Romanians who calls himself a Prince's son\" [52] The latter (identified as Vlad's illegitimate brother, Vlad Călugărul) [43] [53] took possession of Amlaș, which had customarily been held by the rulers of Wallachia in Transylvania [52]\n\n\nOttoman war\nKonstantin Mihailović (who served as a janissary in the sultan's army) recorded that Vlad refused to pay homage to the sultan in an unspecified year [81] The Renaissance historian Giovanni Maria degli Angiolelli likewise wrote that Vlad had failed to pay tribute to the sultan for three years [81] Both records suggest that Vlad ignored the suzerainty of the Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed II, already in 1459, but both works were written decades after the events [82] Tursun Beg (a secretary in the sultan's court) stated that Vlad only turned against the Ottoman Empire when the sultan \"was away on the long expedition in Trebizon\" in 1461 [83] According to Tursun Beg, Vlad started new negotiations with Matthias Corvinus, but the sultan was soon informed by his spies [84] [85] Mehmed sent his envoy, the Greek Thomas Katabolinos (also known as Yunus bey), to Wallachia, ordering Vlad to come to Constantinople [84] [85] He also sent secret instructions to Hamza, bey of Nicopolis, to capture Vlad after he crossed the Danube [86] [87] Vlad found out the sultan's \"deceit and trickery\", captured Hamza and Katabolinos, and had them executed [86] [87]\n\n\nImprisonment in Hungary\nMatthias Corvinus came to Transylvania in November 1462 [109] The negotiations between Corvinus and Vlad lasted for weeks, [110] but Corvinus did not want to wage war against the Ottoman Empire [111] [112] At the king's order, his Czech mercenary commander, John Jiskra of Brandýs, captured Vlad near Rucăr in Wallachia [109] [111]\n\n\nThird rule and death\nMatthias Corvinus recognized Vlad as the lawful prince of Wallachia, but he did not provide him with military assistance to regain his principality [109] Vlad settled in a house in Pest [118] When a group of soldiers broke into the house while pursuing a thief who had tried to hide there, Vlad had their commander executed because they had not asked his permission before entering his home, according to the Slavic stories about his life [117] Vlad moved to Transylvania in June 1475 [119] He wanted to settle in Sibiu and sent his envoy to the town in early June to arrange a house for him [119] Mehmed II acknowledged Basarab Laiotă as the lawful ruler of Wallachia [119] Corvinus ordered the burghers of Sibiu to give 200 golden florins to Vlad from the royal revenues on 21 September, but Vlad left Transylvania for Buda in October [120]\n\n\nFamily\nVlad had two wives, according to modern specialists [140] [141] His first wife may have been an illegitimate daughter of John Hunyadi, according to historian Alexandru Simon [140] Vlad's second wife was Justina Szilágyi, who was a cousin of Matthias Corvinus [140] [142] She was the widow of Vencel Pongrác of Szentmiklós when \"Ladislaus Dragwlya\" married her, most probably in 1475 [143] She survived Vlad Dracul, and married thirdly Pál Suki, then János Erdélyi [142]\n\n\nLegacy\nStories about Vlad's brutal acts began circulating during his lifetime [147] After his arrest, courtiers of Matthias Corvinus promoted their spread [148] The papal legate, Niccolo Modrussiense, had already written about such stories to Pope Pius II in 1462 [149] Two years later, the Pope included them in his Commentaries [150]\n\n\nReputation for cruelty\nStories about Vlad's brutal acts began circulating during his lifetime [147] After his arrest, courtiers of Matthias Corvinus promoted their spread [148] The papal legate, Niccolo Modrussiense, had already written about such stories to Pope Pius II in 1462 [149] Two years later, the Pope included them in his Commentaries [150]\n\n\nFirst records\nStories about Vlad's brutal acts began circulating during his lifetime [147] After his arrest, courtiers of Matthias Corvinus promoted their spread [148] The papal legate, Niccolo Modrussiense, had already written about such stories to Pope Pius II in 1462 [149] Two years later, the Pope included them in his Commentaries [150]\n\n\nGerman stories\nWorks containing the stories about Vlad's cruelty were published in Low German in the Holy Roman Empire before 1480 [159] [160] The stories were allegedly written in the early 1460s, because they describe Vlad's campaign across the Danube in early 1462, but they do not refer to Mehmed II's invasion of Wallachia in June of the same year [161] They provide a detailed narration of the conflicts between Vlad and the Transylvanian Saxons, showing that they originated \"in the literary minds of the Saxons\" [159]\n\n\nSlavic stories\nThere are more than twenty manuscripts (written between the 15th and 18th centuries) [165] which preserved the text of the Skazanie o Drakule voievode (The Tale about Voivode Dracula) [166] The manuscripts were written in Russian, but they copied a text that had originally been recorded in a South Slavic language, because they contain expressions alien to the Russian language but used in South Slavic idioms (such as diavol for \"evil\") [167] The original text was written in Buda between 1482 and 1486 [168]\n\n\nAssertion by modern standards\nThe mass murders that Vlad carried out indiscriminately and brutally would most likely amount to acts of genocide and war crimes by current standards [174] Romanian defense minister Ioan Mircea Pașcu asserted that Vlad would have been condemned for crimes against humanity had he been put on trial at Nuremberg [175]\n\n\nVampire mythology\nThe stories about Vlad made him the best-known medieval ruler of the Romanian lands in Europe [197] However, Bram Stoker's Dracula, which was published in 1897, was the first book to make a connection between Dracula and vampirism [198] Stoker had his attention drawn to the blood-sucking vampires of Romanian folklore by Emily Gerard's article about Transylvanian superstitions (published in 1885) [199] His limited knowledge about the medieval history of Wallachia came from William Wilkinson's book entitled Account of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia with Political Observations Relative to Them, published in 1820 [200] [201]\n\n\nAppearance and representations\nPope Pius II's legate, Niccolò Modrussa, painted the only extant description of Vlad, whom he had met in Buda [205] A copy of Vlad's portrait has been featured in the \"monster portrait gallery\" in the Ambras Castle at Innsbruck [206] The picture depicts \"a strong, cruel, and somehow tortured man\" with \"large, deep-set, dark green, and penetrating eyes\", according to Florescu [206] The colour of Vlad's hair cannot be determined because Modrussa mentions that Vlad was black-haired, while the portrait seems to show that he had fair hair [206] The picture depicts Vlad with a large lower lip [206]\n\n\nSee

Impaler**\n\nVlad III, commonly known as Vlad the Impaler, was a member of the House of Drăculești, a branch of the House of Basarab, and the voivode of Wallachia. He is best known for his cruelty and his methods of punishment, which included impaling his enemies on sharp stakes. However, his reputation as a ruthless ruler has been somewhat exaggerated by later accounts and folklore.\n\n**The Name**\n\nThe name Dracula, which is now primarily known as the name of a vampire, was for centuries known as the sobriquet of Vlad III. Diplomatic reports and popular stories referred to him as Dracula, Dracuglia, or Drakula already in the 15th century. He himself signed his two letters as \"Dragulya\" or \"Drakulya\" in the late 1470s. His name had its origin in the sobriquet of his father, Vlad Dracul (\"Vlad the Dragon\" in medieval Romanian), who received it after he became a member of the Order of the Dragon. Dracula is the Slavonic genitive form of Dracul, meaning \"the son\" of Dracul (or the Dragon). In modern Romanian, dracul means \"the devil\", which contributed to Vlad's reputation.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nVlad was the second legitimate son of Vlad II Dracul, who was himself an illegitimate son of Mircea I of Wallachia. Vlad II had won the moniker \"Dracul\" for his membership in the Order of the Dragon, a militant fraternity founded by Sigismund of Luxemburg, King of Hungary. The Order of the Dragon was dedicated to halting the Ottoman advance into Europe.

Vlad was most probably born after his father settled in Transylvania in 1429. Historian Radu Florescu writes that Vlad was born in the Transylvanian Saxon town of Sighisoara (then in the Kingdom of Hungary), where his father lived in a three-story stone house from 1431 to 1435. Modern historians identify Vlad's mother either as a daughter or kinswoman of Alexander I of Moldavia or as his father's unknown first wife.\n\n**Reigns**\n\nUpon the death of his father and elder brother, Vlad became a potential claimant to Wallachia. Vladislav II of Wallachia accompanied John Hunyadi, who launched a campaign against the Ottoman Empire in September 1448. Taking advantage of his opponent's absence, Vlad broke into Wallachia at the head of an Ottoman army in early October. He had to accept that the Ottomans had captured the fortress of Giurgiu on the Danube and strengthened it.\n\n**First Rule**\n\nUpon the death of his father and elder brother, Vlad became a potential claimant to Wallachia. Vladislav II of Wallachia accompanied John Hunyadi, who launched a campaign against the Ottoman Empire in September 1448. Taking advantage of his opponent's absence, Vlad broke into Wallachia at the head of an Ottoman army in early October. He had to accept that the Ottomans had captured the fortress of Giurgiu on the Danube and strengthened it.\n\n**In Exile**\n\nVlad first settled in Edirne in the Ottoman Empire after his fall. Not long after, he moved to Moldavia, where Bogdan II (his father's brother-in-law and possibly his maternal uncle) had mounted the throne with John Hunyadi's support in the autumn of 1449. After Bogdan was murdered by Peter III Aaron in October 1451, Bogdan's son, Stephen, fled to Transylvania with Vlad to seek assistance from Hunyadi. However, Hunyadi concluded a three-year truce with the Ottoman Empire on 20 November 1451, acknowledging the Wallachian boyars' right to elect the successor of Vladislav II if he died.\n\n**Second Rule**\n\nThe circumstances and the date of Vlad's return to Wallachia are uncertain. He invaded Wallachia with Hungarian support either in April, July or August 1456. Vladislav II died during the invasion. Vlad sent his first extant letter as voivode of Wallachia to the burghers of Brasov on 10 September. He promised to protect them in case of an Ottoman invasion of Transylvania, but he also sought their assistance if the Ottomans occupied Wallachia. In the same letter, he stated that \"when a man or a prince is strong and powerful he can make peace as he wants to; but when he is weak, a stronger one will come and do what he wants to him\", showing his authoritarian personality.\n\n**Conflict with the Saxons**\n\nVlad sent the customary tribute to the sultan. After John Hunyadi died on 11 August 1456, his elder son, Ladislaus Hunyadi became the captain-general of Hungary. He accused Vlad of having \"no intention of remaining faithful\" to the king of Hungary in a letter to the burghers of Brasov, also ordering them to support Vladislaus II's brother, Dan III, against Vlad. The burghers of Sibiu supported another pretender, a “priest of the Romanians who calls himself a Prince's son\". The latter (identified as Vlad's illegitimate brother, Vlad Călugărul) took possession of Amlaș, which had customarily been held by the rulers of Wallachia in Transylvania.\n\n**Ottoman War**\n\nKonstantin Mihailović (who served as a janissary in the sultan's army) recorded that Vlad refused to pay homage to the sultan in an unspecified year. The Renaissance historian Giovanni Maria degli Angiolelli likewise wrote that Vlad had failed to pay tribute to the sultan for three years. Both records suggest that Vlad ignored the suzerainty of the Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed II, already in 1459, but both works were written decades after the events. Tursun Beg (a secretary in the sultan's court) stated that Vlad only turned against the Ottoman Empire when the sultan \"was away on the long expedition in Trebizon\" in 1461. According to Tursun Beg, Vlad started new negotiations with Matthias Corvinus, but the sultan was soon informed by his spies. Mehmed sent his envoy, the Greek Thomas Katabolinos (also known as Yunus bey), to Wallachia, ordering Vlad to come to Constantinople. He also sent secret instructions to Hamza, bey of Nicopolis, to capture Vlad after he crossed the Danube. Vlad found out the sultan's \"deceit and trickery\", captured Hamza and Katabolinos, and had them executed.\n\n**Imprisonment in Hungary**\n\nMatthias Corvinus came to Transylvania in November 1462. The negotiations between Corvinus and Vlad lasted for weeks, but Corvinus did not want to wage war against the Ottoman Empire. At the king's order, his Czech mercenary commander, John Jiskra of Brandýs, captured Vlad near Rucăr in Wallachia.\n\n**Third Rule and Death**\n\nMatthias Corvinus recognized Vlad as the lawful prince of Wallachia, but he did not provide him with military assistance to regain his principality. Vlad settled in a house in Pest. When a group of soldiers broke into the house while pursuing a thief who had tried to hide there, Vlad had their commander executed because they had not asked his permission before entering his home, according to the Slavic stories about his life. Vlad moved to Transylvania in June 1475. He wanted to settle in Sibiu and sent his envoy to the town in early June to arrange a house for him. Mehmed II acknowledged Basarab Laiotă as the lawful ruler of Wallachia. Corvinus ordered the burghers of Sibiu to give 200 golden florins to Vlad from the royal revenues on 21 September, but Vlad left Transylvania for Buda in October.\n\n**Family**\n\nVlad had two wives, according to modern specialists. His first wife may have been an illegitimate daughter of John Hunyadi, according to historian Alexandru Simon. Vlad's second wife was Justina Szilágyi, who was a cousin of Matthias Corvinus. She was the widow of Vencel Pongrác of Szentmiklós when \"Ladislaus Dragwlya\" married her, most probably in 1475. She survived Vlad Dracul, and married thirdly Pál Suki, then János Erdélyi.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nStories about Vlad's brutal acts began circulating during his lifetime. After his arrest, courtiers of Matthias Corvinus promoted their spread. The papal legate, Niccolo Modrussiense, had already written about such stories to Pope Pius II in 1462. Two years later, the Pope included them in his Commentaries.\n\n**Reputation for Cruelty**\n\nStories about Vlad's brutal acts began circulating during his lifetime. After his arrest, courtiers of Matthias Corvinus promoted their spread. The papal legate, Niccolo Modrussiense, had already written about such stories to Pope Pius II in 1462. Two years later, the Pope included them in his Commentaries.\n\n**First Records**\n\nStories about Vlad's brutal acts began circulating during his lifetime. After his arrest, courtiers of Matthias Corvinus promoted their spread. The papal legate, Niccolo Modrussiense, had already written about such stories to Pope Pius II in 1462. Two years later, the Pope included them in his Commentaries.\n\n**German Stories**\n\nWorks containing the stories about Vlad's cruelty were published in Low German in the Holy Roman Empire before 1480. The stories were allegedly written in the early 1460s, because they describe Vlad's campaign across the Danube in early 1462, but they do not refer to Mehmed II's invasion of Wallachia in June of the same year. They provide a detailed narration of the conflicts between Vlad and the Transylvanian Saxons, showing that they originated \"in the literary minds of the Saxons\".\n\n**Slavic Stories**\n\nThere are more than twenty manuscripts (written between the 15th and 18th centuries) which preserved the text of the Skazanie o Drakule voievode (The Tale about Voivode Dracula). The manuscripts were written in Russian, but they copied a text that had originally been recorded in a South Slavic language, because they contain expressions alien to the Russian language but used in South Slavic idioms (such as diavol for \"evil\"). The original text was written in Buda between 1482 and 1486.\n\n**Assertion by Modern Standards**\n\nThe mass murders that Vlad carried out indiscriminately and brutally would most likely amount to acts of genocide and war crimes by current standards. Romanian defense minister Ioan Mircea Pașcu asserted that Vlad would have been condemned for crimes against humanity had he been put on trial at Nuremberg.\n\n**Vampire Mythology**\n\nThe stories about Vlad made him the best-known medieval ruler of the Romanian lands in Europe. However, Bram Stoker's Dracula, which was published in 1897, was the first book to make a connection between Dracula and vampirism. Stoker had his attention drawn to the blood-sucking vampires of Romanian folklore by Emily Gerard's article about Transylvanian superstitions (published in 1885). His limited knowledge about the medieval history of Wallachia came from William Wilkinson's book entitled Account of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia with Political Observations Relative to Them, published in 1820.\n\n**Appearance and Representations**\n\nPope Pius II's legate, Niccolò Modrussa, painted the only extant description of Vlad, whom he had met in Buda. A copy of Vlad's portrait has been featured in the \"monster portrait gallery\" in the Ambras Castle at Innsbruck. The picture depicts \"a strong, cruel, and somehow tortured man\" with \"large, deep-set, dark green, and penetrating eyes\", according to Florescu. The colour of Vlad's hair cannot be determined because Modrussa mentions that Vlad was black-haired, while the portrait seems to show that he had fair hair. The picture depicts Vlad with a large lower lip.\n\n**See Also**\n\nThe article does not include a \"See Also\" section.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe article does not include a \"Notes\"

Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Vlad_the_Impaler\" following this outline:\n\n\nName\nThe name Dracula, which is now primarily known as the name of a vampire, was for centuries known as the sobriquet of Vlad III [7] [8] Diplomatic reports and popular stories referred to him as Dracula, Dracuglia, or Drakula already in the 15th century [7] He himself signed his two letters as \"Dragulya\" or \"Drakulya\" in the late 1470s [9] His name had its origin in the sobriquet of his father, Vlad Dracul (\"Vlad the Dragon\" in medieval Romanian), who received it after he became a member of the Order of the Dragon [10] [11] Dracula is the Slavonic genitive form of Dracul, meaning \" [the son] of Dracul (or the Dragon)\" [11] [12] In modern Romanian, dracul means \"the devil\", which contributed to Vlad's reputation [12]\n\n\nEarly life\nVlad was the second legitimate son of Vlad II Dracul, who was himself an illegitimate son of Mircea I of Wallachia Vlad II had won the moniker \"Dracul\" for his membership in the Order of the Dragon, a militant fraternity founded by Sigismund of Luxemburg, King of Hungary The Order of the Dragon was dedicated to halting the Ottoman advance into Europe [14] Since he was old enough to be a candidate for the throne of Wallachia in 1448, Vlad's time of birth would have been between 1428 and 1431 [15] [14] Vlad was most probably born after his father settled in Transylvania in 1429 [16] [14] Historian Radu Florescu writes that Vlad was born in the Transylvanian Saxon town of Sighișoara (then in the Kingdom of Hungary), where his father lived in a three-story stone house from 1431 to 1435 [17] Modern historians identify Vlad's mother either as a daughter or kinswoman of Alexander I of Moldavia [14] [17] [18] or as his father's unknown first wife [19]\n\n\nReigns\nUpon the death of his father and elder brother, Vlad became a potential claimant to Wallachia [19] Vladislav II of Wallachia accompanied John Hunyadi, who launched

another comic series of the same name, by an unknown writer, from the Australian comic publishing company Frew Publications [citation needed] Although this early incarnation of the team (created by Kanigher and artist Ross Andru) did not have the antics of later iterations, it explained much of squad's field leader Rick Flag's personal history [2] The team's administrator Amanda Waller was introduced in the Legends miniseries, [3] with the original Silver Age Squad's backstory elaborated in Secret Origins (vol 2) #14 [4] [5]\n\n\nPublication history\nThe original Suicide Squad first appears in The Brave and the Bold #25 Team members appearing in the debut issue include physicist Jess Bright; astronomer Dr Hugh Evans; Rick Flag Jr., the team leader; and Karin Grace (Davies in #26, Grace in #37), flight medic The characters have follow-up appearances in issues #26, #27 and #37-#39 The team's introductory story depicts them being called in to deal with a super-heated red-hued object, called the \"Red Wave\", which was heading toward a seaside resort and boiling the ocean along the way They travel in a plane equipped with a testing and analysis lab Follow-up appearances show the team dealing with a variety of challenges: a meteor storm (the radiation from which causes them to shrink), a giant serpent in the Paris subway tunnels, a giant monster that captures Karin, and a nuclear bomb Issues #38 and #39 show the team encountering dinosaurs and meeting the leader of the Cyclops [19] [1] [20]\n\n\nSilver Age\nThe Most Wanted miniseries highlight individual members

Squad then continued in The War that Time Forgot, published in Star Spangled War Stories #110-111, #116-121, #125, and #127-128, that introduced the characters Morgan and Mace [21]\n\n\nLegends\nIn the midst of Darkseid's attempt to turn humanity against Earth's superheroes via his minion Glorious Godfrey, Amanda Waller assigns Rick Flag Jr leadership of a reformed Task Force X [22] Blockbuster, Bronze Tiger, Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, and Enchantress make up Task Force X at Belle Reve The squad's first mission is to eliminate Darkseid's rampaging fire elemental Brimstone; Blockbuster dies during the conflict and Deadshot takes down the creature with an experimental laser rifle [23] Waller dismisses the group, [24] though they soon reconvened to rescue Captain Boomerang after Godfrey captures him [25]\n\n\nSecret Origins (vol. 2)\nDuring World War II, a number of Army riffraff are assembled into a unit that is highly expendable, and therefore nicknamed the Suicide Squadron (shortened to Suicide Squad) Several such teams existed, but their history in comics is only scarcely recorded before Rick Flag, Sr becomes the leader of the team (and even then, only a few adventures of this Squad are shown) After the war ends, the team (together with the Argent group) is put under the umbrella organization of Task Force X After his father's death, Rick Flag Jr goes on to lead the group that is featured in The Brave and the Bold A deadly encounter with a Yeti during a mission in Cambodia ends with Evans and Bright dead and sends Flag back to the U.S with a wounded Karin Grace After a stint with the Forgotten Heroes, Flag is drafted into the Squad that Waller assembles in Legends [4]\n\n\nOther World War II Suicide Squads\nThe World War II Squad of Secret Origins (vol 2) #14 was a means of tying the Silver Age Suicide Squad to the war-era Suicide Squad (also called the Suicide Squadron) created by Robert Kanigher for his \"The War that Time Forgot\" tales in the pages of Star Spangled War Stories [27] This Suicide Squadron is described as a \"top-secret Ranger outfit\" whose members were trained to tackle missions from which ordinary volunteers were not expected to return alive It is unclear whether this team is part of the modern Suicide Squad canon or if the Squad introduced in Secret Origins was intended as a replacement for them in DC continuity.\n\n\nSuicide Squad (vol. 1)\nThe first volume of Suicide Squad, written by modern Squad creator John Ostrander, launched in May 1987, shortly after the team was introduced in the \"Legends\" crossover storyline It lasted for 66 monthly issues, along with one annual and one special (Doom Patrol and Suicide Squad Special #1), both published in 1988.\n\n\nBackground\nDC Comics created a magical version of the Suicide Squad known as Suicide Squad Black in 2019 during the DC Rebirth run It was created by Jai Nitz and Scot Eaton The team have a six-issue comic series titled Suicide Squad: Black Files.\n\n\nPlot synopsis\nThe monthly Suicide Squad comic was again relaunched at the start of 2020, written by Tom Taylor with art by Bruno Redondo.\n\n\n\"Baptism of Fire\"\nThe team's first mission in the Suicide Squad title set them up against their recurring enemies, the Onslaught They infiltrate their headquarters (the fortress known as Jotunheim, situated in Qurac) and proceed to defeat and kill most of the Onslaught members Elements from this first story arc return over the series, such as the death of Mindboggler, Captain Boomerang's cowardly and

their willingness to engage in morally ambiguous and often deadly missions. The team's concept has been revisited and reimagined numerous times over the years, with various iterations and interpretations appearing in comic books, television shows, and films.\n\n# Background and Creation\n\nThe original Suicide Squad appeared in six issues of The Brave and the Bold, created by Robert Kanigher and artist Ross Andru. The team's name was taken from another comic series of the same name by an unknown writer, published by Frew Publications. Although this early incarnation of the team did not have the antics of later iterations, it explained much of squad's field leader Rick Flag's personal history.\n\n## Silver Age\n\nThe Silver Age Suicide Squad was introduced in The Brave and the Bold #25, with a lineup consisting of physicist Jess Bright, astronomer Dr. Hugh Evans, Rick Flag Jr., and Karin Grace, a flight medic. The team's introductory story depicted them being called in to deal with a super-heated red-hued object, called the \"Red Wave,\" which was heading toward a seaside resort and boiling the ocean along the way.\n\n## Publication History\n\nThe original Suicide Squad first appeared in The Brave and the Bold #25, with subsequent appearances in issues #26, #27, and #37-#39.

These issues mark the Squad's final appearances prior to DC Comics' New 52 continuity reboot in 2011.\n\n# New Suicide Squad\n\nThe New Suicide Squad title, written by Adam Glass, launched in September 2011 as part of The New 52. The team was led by Amanda Waller and consisted of Deadshot, Harley Quinn, and other new members.\n\n## Members\n\n* Deadshot, the team's leader\n* Harley Quinn, a former villain turned anti-hero\n* Captain Boomerang, a skilled mercenary\n* Katana, a samurai warrior\n* Enchantress, a mystic\n* New members include: El Diablo, a pyromancer; Cheshire, a skilled assassin; and Black Manta, a former villain.\n\n# Justice League vs. Suicide Squad\n\nThe Justice League vs. Suicide Squad crossover event saw the Justice League learn of the Suicide Squad's existence and confront them on the island of Badhinisia. The Squad was defeated by the Justice League until Killer Frost absorbed a portion of Superman's life force and froze everyone.\n\n# DC Rebirth\n\nThe DC Rebirth initiative saw the relaunch of the entire DC Comics line, including the Suicide Squad. The new series, written by Tom Taylor, launched in 2020 and features a new lineup of characters, including:\n\n## Members\n\n* Rick Flag, the team's leader\n* Deadshot, a skilled marksman\n* Harley

much of squad's field leader Rick Flag's personal history [2] The team's administrator Amanda Waller was introduced in the Legends miniseries, [3] with the original Silver Age Squad's backstory elaborated in Secret Origins (vol 2) #14 [4] [5]\n\n\nPublication history\nThe original Suicide Squad first appears in The Brave and the Bold #25 Team members appearing in the debut issue include

Stories #110-111, #116-121, #125, and #127-128, that introduced the characters Morgan and Mace [21]\n\n\nLegends\nIn the midst of Darkseid's attempt to turn humanity against Earth's superheroes via

at Belle Reve The squad's first mission is to eliminate Darkseid's rampaging fire elemental Brimstone; Blockbuster dies during the conflict and Deadshot takes down the creature with an experimental laser rifle [23] Waller dismisses the group, [24] though they soon reconvened to rescue Captain Boomerang after Godfrey captures him [25]\n\n\nSecret Origins (vol. 2)\nDuring World War II, a number of Army riffraff are assembled into a unit that is highly expendable, and therefore nicknamed the Suicide Squadron (shortened to Suicide Squad) Several such teams existed, but their history in comics is only scarcely recorded before Rick Flag, Sr becomes the leader of the team (and even then, only a few adventures of this Squad are shown) After the war ends, the team (together with the Argent group) is put under the umbrella organization of Task Force X After his father's death, Rick Flag Jr goes on to lead the group that is featured in The Brave and the Bold A deadly encounter with a Yeti during a mission in Cambodia ends with Evans and Bright dead and sends Flag back to the U.S with a wounded Karin Grace After a stint with the Forgotten Heroes, Flag is drafted into the Squad that Waller assembles in Legends [4]\n\n\nOther World War II Suicide Squads\nThe World War II Squad of Secret Origins (vol 2) #14 was a means of tying the Silver Age Suicide Squad to the war-era Suicide Squad (also called the Suicide Squadron) created by Robert Kanigher for his \"The War that Time Forgot\" tales in the pages of Star Spangled War Stories [27] This Suicide Squadron is described as a \"top-secret Ranger outfit\" whose members were trained to tackle missions from which ordinary volunteers were not expected to return alive It is unclear whether this team is part of the modern Suicide Squad canon or if the Squad introduced in Secret Origins was intended as a replacement for them in DC continuity.\n\n\nSuicide Squad (vol. 1)\nThe first volume of Suicide Squad, written by modern Squad creator John Ostrander, launched in May 1987, shortly after the team was introduced in the \"Legends\" crossover storyline It lasted for 66 monthly issues, along with one annual and one

skirmishes, Superman ends the free-for-all with a shockwave caused by clapping both his hands together The League confronts Ray Palmer, and he tells them about Micro Force and their murder of Adam

The play is widely regarded as one of the most memorable moments in the sport's history.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Oakland Raiders had been to the postseason four previous times. In 1967, they won the AFL Championship before losing Super Bowl II against the Green Bay Packers. The following three seasons, they made it back to the playoffs but lost to the eventual champions in all three instances (New York Jets in 1968, Kansas City Chiefs in 1969, Baltimore Colts in 1970). The \"Immaculate Reception\" game thus marked their return to the postseason after missing out on a playoff berth the year before.\n\n**Playoff History**\n\nThe Oakland Raiders had been to the postseason four previous times. In 1967, they won the AFL Championship before losing Super Bowl II against the Green Bay Packers. The following three seasons, they made it back to the playoffs but lost to the eventual champions in all three instances (New York Jets in 1968, Kansas City Chiefs in 1969, Baltimore Colts in 1970). The \"Immaculate Reception\" game thus marked their return to the postseason after missing out on a playoff berth the year before.\n\n**1972 Season**\n\nThe 1972 season marked the third year after the AFL-NFL merger, which had the Steelers move to the newly formed American Football Conference despite not having been a member of the American Football League. Thus, this was the third year in which a playoff meeting between the Raiders and the Steelers could take place outside a Super Bowl.\n\n**Game Synopsis**\n\nThe teams played to a scoreless tie at halftime, with Oakland's longest gain coming on an 11-yard completion from Daryle Lamonica to Fred Biletnikoff. Pittsburgh, meanwhile, came fairly close to a scoring chance, but passed up on a field goal attempt from the Oakland 31-yard line. Instead, Steelers running back John Fuqua was stopped by Raiders safety Jack Tatum on a fourth-and-2 run to turn possession over to the Raiders. On its first possession of the second half, however, Pittsburgh opted for a field goal, with placekicker Roy Gerela's successful 18-yard attempt accounting for the first score of the game.\n\n**Events of the Play**\n\nTrailing Oakland 7–6, the Steelers faced fourth-and-10 on their own 40-yard line with 22 seconds remaining in the game and no timeouts. Head coach Chuck Noll called a pass play, 66 Circle Option, intended for receiver Barry Pearson, a rookie who was playing in his first NFL game. The play was a short pass to Fuqua, who was supposed to run with the ball to the sideline. However, Raiders safety Jack Tatum jumped the route and hit Fuqua, causing the ball to bounce off his back and land in the hands of Fuqua's teammate, Franco Harris, who was running towards the sideline. Harris, who had not caught a pass all season, scooped up the ball and ran the remaining 22 yards to the end zone for the game-winning touchdown.\n\n**Referee Call**\n\nAfter the play, a critical question remained: who did the football touch in the Fuqua/Tatum collision? If it bounced off Fuqua without ever touching Tatum, then Harris' reception was illegal. If the ball bounced off only Tatum or if it bounced off both Fuqua and Tatum (in any order) then the reception was legal. The rule stated in the pertinent part that if an offensive player touches a pass first, he is the only offensive player eligible to catch the pass. However, if a defensive player touches the pass first, or simultaneously with or subsequent to its having been touched by only one offensive player, then all offensive players become and remain eligible to catch the pass.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe week after this playoff victory, the Steelers lost the AFC Championship Game, 21–17, to the Miami Dolphins, who went on to win Super Bowl VII in their landmark undefeated season. Had the Raiders advanced to the AFC Championship Game instead, they would have entered that contest with an all-time record (including playoffs) of 6–1–1 against the Dolphins.\n\n**Game Ball**\n\nThe actual ball ended up in the hands of fan Jim Baker, who attended the game with his young nephew, Bobby. Baker managed to scoop up the ball during the ensuing melee after the extra point kick, grabbed his nephew, and ran off the field. He had offered to give the ball back to the Steelers in return for lifetime season tickets but was rebuffed. He has since declined any offer to sell it, including the highest offer of $150,000 from heavy equipment provider Ray Anthony International. Baker has instead kept this coveted piece of NFL memorabilia in a guarded bank vault in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, occasionally bringing it out for public appearances involving the Steelers, including one with Franco Harris in 1997 to commemorate the play's 25th anniversary.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThe Steelers organization still consider the Immaculate Reception the greatest moment in team history.

The murderer, Mark David Chapman, was a 25-year-old fan who had become obsessed with Lennon's music and had been stalking him for days. This article will provide a detailed account of the events leading up to the murder, the shooting itself, and the aftermath.\n\nBackground\nMark David Chapman, a 25-year-old former security guard from Honolulu, Hawaii, was a fan of the Beatles. He had become particularly enamored with John Lennon, and his music had taken on great personal significance for Chapman. One of the novels that had a significant impact on Chapman was J.D. Salinger's \"The Catcher in the Rye\". The novel's main theme is the protagonist's rage against adult hypocrisy and \"phonies\". Chapman claimed that he had been enraged by Lennon's infamous remark in 1966 that the Beatles were \"more popular than Jesus\", and by the lyrics of Lennon's songs \"God\" and \"Imagine\", where Lennon states that he does not believe in the Beatles, God or Jesus. Chapman concluded that the latter made Lennon a \"phony\".\n\nMark David Chapman\nMark David Chapman was a 25-year-old former security guard from Honolulu, Hawaii. He had no prior criminal convictions and had become a fan of the Beatles. Chapman had become particularly enamored with John Lennon, and his music had taken on great personal significance for him. He had read J.D. Salinger's novel \"The Catcher in the Rye\" and had been influenced by its themes. Chapman claimed that he had been enraged by Lennon's infamous remark in 1966 that the Beatles were \"more popular than Jesus\", and by the lyrics of Lennon's songs \"God\" and \"Imagine\", where Lennon states that he does not believe in the Beatles, God or Jesus. Chapman concluded that the latter made Lennon a \"phony\".\n\n8 December 1980\nChapman waited for Lennon outside the Dakota in the early morning and spent most of the day near the entrance to the building, talking to fans and the doorman. During that morning, Chapman was distracted and missed seeing Lennon step out of a taxi and enter the Dakota. Later in the morning, Chapman met Lennon's family nanny, Helen Seaman, who was returning from a walk with Lennon's five-year-old son Sean. Chapman reached in front of the housekeeper to shake Sean's hand and said that he was a beautiful boy, quoting Lennon's song \"Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)\".\n\nShooting\nThe Lennons returned to the Dakota at approximately 10:50 p.m. Lennon wanted to say goodnight to his son before going to the Stage Deli restaurant with Ono.

She is best known for her marriage to Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, and for her literary career. Scott is also a prominent philanthropist, having pledged to give away most of her wealth to charity over her lifetime or in her will.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n\nMacKenzie Scott Tuttle was born on April 7, 1970, in San Francisco, California. She comes from a family of modest means and grew up with a love for writing. Her parents, Holiday Robin (née Cuming) and Jason Baker Tuttle, instilled in her a love of literature and learning. Scott has two brothers and was named after her maternal grandfather, G Scott Cuming, who worked as an executive and general counsel at El Paso Natural Gas.\n\n## Early Writing Career\n\nScott claims to have started writing seriously at the age of six, when she wrote a 142-page book called The Book Worm. The book was unfortunately destroyed in a flood, but it marked the beginning of Scott's writing journey. She continued to write throughout her childhood and teenage years, developing a passion for storytelling and language.\n\nCareer\n\nAfter graduating from college, Scott worked as a research assistant to Morrison for the 1992 novel Jazz. She also worked in an administrative role for hedge fund D E Shaw in New York City, where she met Jeff Bezos. The two began dating and eventually married in 1993.\n\n## Amazon\n\nIn 1993, Scott and Bezos moved to Seattle and Bezos founded Amazon with Scott's support. Scott was heavily involved in Amazon's early days, working on the company's name, business plan, accounts, and shipping early orders. She also negotiated the company's first freight contract. After 1996, Scott took a less involved role in the business, focusing on her family and literary career.\n\nLiterary Career\n\nIn 2005, Scott wrote her debut novel, The Testing of Luther Albright, for which she won an American Book Award in 2006. The novel took Scott ten years to write, as she was helping Bezos build Amazon and raising her family. The book was praised by critics, with Toni Morrison reviewing it as \"a rarity: a sophisticated novel that breaks and swells the heart.\" Scott's second novel, Traps, was published in 2013. According to NPD BookScan, sales of her books were modest.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nScott was married to Jeff Bezos for 25 years, until they divorced in 2019. The couple has four children: three sons, and a daughter. During their marriage, Scott was known for her support of Bezos' business ventures, including Amazon.\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nIn May 2019, Scott signed the Giving Pledge, a charitable-giving campaign in which she undertook to give away most of her wealth to charity over her lifetime or in her will. Despite its name, the pledge is not legally binding. Scott has since donated millions of dollars to various causes, including education, healthcare, and the arts.\n\nBibliography\n\n* The Testing of Luther Albright (2005)\n* Traps (2013)\n\nSee Also\n\n* Jeff Bezos\n* Amazon\n* Philanthropy\n\nReferences\n\n* None\n\nFurther Reading\n\n* \"MacKenzie Scott: The Unlikely Philanthropist\" by The New York Times\n* \"The Giving Pledge: How MacKenzie Scott is Changing the Face of Philanthropy\" by Forbes\n* \"MacKenzie Scott: A Life in Writing\" by Publishers Weekly", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"MacKenzie_Scott\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nMacKenzie Scott Tuttle was born on April 7, 1970, in San Francisco, California, to Holiday Robin (née Cuming), a homemaker, and Jason Baker Tuttle, a financial planner [15] [16] She has two brothers [15] She was named after her maternal grandfather, G Scott Cuming, who worked as an executive and general counsel at El Paso Natural Gas [15] She claims to remember writing seriously at the age of six, when she wrote The Book Worm, a 142-page book that was destroyed in a flood [17]\n\n\nCareer\nAfter graduating from college, Tuttle worked as a research assistant to Morrison for the 1992 novel Jazz [17] She also worked in an administrative role for hedge fund D E Shaw in New York City, where she met Jeff Bezos [17]\n\n\nAmazon\nIn 1993, Scott and Bezos married The following year, they left D E Shaw, moved to Seattle, and Bezos founded Amazon with Scott's support Scott was one of Amazon's early key contributors, and was heavily involved in Amazon's early days, working on the company's name, business plan, accounts, and shipping early orders [17] [8] She also negotiated the company's first freight contract [8] After 1996, Scott took a less involved role in the business, focusing on her family and literary career [17]\n\n\nLiterary career\nIn 2005, Scott wrote her debut novel, The Testing of Luther Albright, for which she won an American Book Award in 2006 She said that the book took her ten years to write as she was helping Bezos build Amazon and raising her family [19] Toni Morrison, her former professor, reviewed the book as \"a rarity: a sophisticated novel that breaks and swells the heart\" [17] Her second novel, Traps, was published in 2013 [20] According to NPD BookScan, sales of her books were modest [17]\n\n\nPersonal life\nScott was married to Jeff Bezos, [21] [22] whom she met while working as an administrative assistant at D.E Shaw in 1992 After three months of dating, they married and moved from Manhattan to Seattle, Washington, in 1994 [17] They have four children: three sons, and a daughter [23]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nIn May 2019, Scott signed the Giving Pledge, a charitable-giving campaign in which she undertook to give away most of her wealth to charity over her lifetime or in her will Despite its name, the pledge is not legally binding [33]\n\n\nBibliography\n\nI need 99 million $'s\n$charizardbatman\nHeart\n\n\nSee also\n\nI need 99 million $'s\n$charizardbatman\nHeart\n\n\nReferences\n\nI need 99 million $'s\n$charizardbatman\nHeart\n\n\nFurther reading\n\nI need 99 million $'s\n$charizardbatman\nHeart\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Austro-Hungarian occupation until the armistice, but the Poles started to take control as the Central Powers collapsed Initially, the Polish air force consisted of mostly German and Austrian aircraft, left by former occupiers or captured from them, mostly during the Greater Poland Uprising These planes were first used by the Polish Air Force in the Polish-Ukrainian War in late 1918, during combat operations centered around the city of Lwów (now Lviv) [8] On 2 November 1918 pilot Stefan Bastyr performed the first combat flight of Polish aircraft from Lwów [9]\n\n\nInter-war years\nIn 1933,  Zygmunt Pulawski's first high wing, all-metal aircraft, the PZL P.7a, was designed and produced, with 150 entering service The design was followed by 30 improved PZL P.11a aircraft and a final design, the PZL P.11c, was delivered in 1935 and was a respectable fighter for its time; 175 entered service and it remained the only Polish fighter until 1939, by which time foreign aircraft design had overtaken it Its final version, the PZL P.24, was built for export only and was bought by four countries A new fighter prototype, the PZL.50 Jastrząb (Hawk), similar to the Seversky P-35 in layout, was curtailed by the Nazi invasion and the PZL.38 Wilk twin-engine heavy fighter remained a prototype [8]\n\n\n1939\nOn 1 September 1939, at the beginning of the invasion of Poland, all the Polish combat aircraft had been dispersed to secondary airfields, contrary to a commonly-held belief, based on German propaganda, that they had all been destroyed by bombing at their airbases The aircraft destroyed by German bombers on the airfields were mostly trainers The fighters were grouped into 15 escadres; five of them constituted the Pursuit Brigade, deployed in the Warsaw area Despite being obsolete, Polish PZL-11 fighters shot down over 170 German aircraft The bombers, grouped in nine escadres of the Bomber Brigade, attacked armoured ground columns but suffered heavy losses Seven reconnaissance- and 12 observation escadres, deployed to particular armies, were used primarily for reconnaissance Part of the Polish Air Force was destroyed in the campaign; the surviving aircraft were either captured or withdrawn to Romania, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovenia or Sweden, whose air forces subsequently employed these aircraft for their own use (in the case of Romania until 1956) [citation needed] A great number of pilots and aircrew managed to escape to France and then to Britain, where they played a significant part in the defence of the United Kingdom against Nazi invasion, during the Battle of Britain Prior to the conflict Poland also bought 234 planes abroad First of them were on delivery when the conflict started These were Hawker Hurricane (14 planes), Morane-Saulnier 406 (120 planes) and Fairey Battle (100 planes) The ship SS Lassell with 14 Hawker Hurricanes on board left Liverpool on 28 August 1939, deliveries from France were also on way when the conflict broke out [11]\n\n\nStrength of Polish Air Force on 1 September 1939\nAfter the fall of Poland, the Polish Air Force started to regroup in France The only complete unit created before the German attack on France was the GC I/145 fighter squadron, flying Caudron C.714 light fighters It was the only unit operating the C.714 at the time The Polish pilots were also deployed to various French squadrons, flying on all types of French fighters, but mostly on the MS-406 After the surrender of France, many of these pilots managed to escape to Britain to continue the fight against the Luftwaffe.\n\n\n1940 (France)\nAfter the fall of Poland, the Polish Air Force started to regroup in France The only complete unit created before the German attack on France was the GC I/145 fighter

Kingdom)\nFollowing the fall of France in 1940, Polish units were formed in the United Kingdom, as a part of the Royal Air Force and known as the Polish Air Force (PAF) Four Polish squadrons were formed:\n\n\n1943–1945 (Soviet Union)\nAlong with the Polish People's Army (Ludowe Wojsko Polskie) in the USSR, the Polish People's Air Force (Ludowe Lotnictwo Polskie) was created, in defence of the Soviet Union against Nazi invasion Three regiments were formed in late 1943:\n\n\n1949–1989\nIn 1949, the Li-2sb transport aircraft was adapted into a bomber and in 1950, Poland received Petlyakov Pe-2 and Tupolev Tu-2 bombers from the Soviet Union along with USB-1 and USB-2 training bombers In 1950 also, the Yak-17 fighter came into service, as did the Ilyushin Il-12 transport and the Yak-18 trainer From 1951 onwards, the Polish Air Force was equipped with Yak-23 jet fighters and MiG-15 jets, along with a training version, the MiG-15 UTI, and later, in 1961, the MiG-17.\n\n\nPresent-day operations\nAfter political upheaval and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and a consequent reduction in the state of military anxiety in the whole of Europe, the Polish Air Force saw reductions in size On 1 July 1990 the Polish Air Force and the Air Defence Force were merged again (Wojska Lotnicze i Obrony Powietrznej – WLiOP or WLOP) The attack capability of this force consisted primarily of MiG-21s, MiG-23s, MiG-29s, Su-20s and Su-22s The remaining Lim-6bis were withdrawn in the early 1990s, followed soon afterwards by the withdrawal of the remaining Su-20 aircraft The small number of remaining MiG-23s were withdrawn by 1999 Throughout the 1990s, Poland had not purchased any new combat aircraft and only managed to acquire further MiG-29s from the Czech Republic in 1995 and from Germany in 2004 MiG-21s were finally withdrawn from service in 2003 In 2004, the only remaining combat aircraft flown by the WLiOP were the MiG-29 and the Su-22 As of 2010, the fleet of Su-22s is in need of modernization to retain any value as a combat aircraft and its future is unclear [13]\n\n\nEquipment\nNote: Three C-17 Globemaster IIIs are available through the Heavy Airlift

started even before the officially recognised date of regaining independence (11 November 1918) The first independent units of the Polish Air Force, in service to the re-emerging Polish sovereign state, were actually formed before, in 1917, before World War I had come to an end [2] When the Russian Revolution began and the tsardom gradually lost control of the country, Polish pilots took

Aviation Squad) in Odesa [7]\n\n\nEstablishment\nPoland was under German and Austro-Hungarian occupation until the armistice, but the Poles started to take control as the Central Powers collapsed Initially, the Polish air force consisted of mostly German and Austrian aircraft, left by former occupiers or captured from them, mostly during the Greater Poland Uprising These planes were first used by the Polish Air Force in the Polish-Ukrainian War in late 1918, during combat operations centered around the city of Lwów (now Lviv) [8] On 2 November 1918 pilot Stefan Bastyr performed the first combat flight of Polish aircraft from Lwów [9]\n\n\nInter-war years\nIn 1933,  Zygmunt Pulawski's first high wing, all-metal aircraft, the PZL P.7a, was designed and produced, with 150 entering service The design was followed by 30 improved PZL P.11a aircraft and a final design, the PZL P.11c, was delivered in 1935 and was a respectable fighter for its time; 175 entered service and it remained the only Polish fighter until 1939, by which time foreign aircraft design had overtaken it Its final version, the PZL P.24, was built for export only and was bought by four countries A new fighter prototype, the PZL.50 Jastrząb (Hawk), similar to the Seversky P-35 in layout, was curtailed by the Nazi invasion and the PZL.38 Wilk twin-engine heavy fighter remained a prototype [8]\n\n\n1939\nOn 1 September 1939, at the beginning of the invasion of Poland, all the Polish combat aircraft had been dispersed to secondary airfields, contrary to a commonly-held belief, based on German propaganda, that they had all been destroyed by bombing at their airbases The aircraft destroyed by German bombers on the airfields were mostly trainers The fighters were grouped into 15 escadres; five of them constituted the Pursuit Brigade, deployed in the Warsaw area Despite being obsolete, Polish PZL-11 fighters shot down over 170 German aircraft The bombers, grouped in nine escadres of the Bomber Brigade, attacked armoured ground columns but suffered heavy losses Seven reconnaissance- and 12 observation escadres, deployed to particular armies, were used primarily for reconnaissance Part of the Polish Air Force was destroyed in the campaign; the surviving aircraft were either captured or withdrawn to Romania, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovenia or Sweden, whose air forces subsequently employed these aircraft for their own use (in the case of Romania until 1956) [citation needed] A great number of pilots and aircrew managed to escape to France and then to Britain, where they played a significant part in the defence of the United Kingdom against Nazi invasion, during the Battle of Britain Prior to the conflict Poland also bought 234 planes abroad First of them were on delivery when the conflict started These were Hawker Hurricane (14 planes), Morane-Saulnier 406 (120 planes) and Fairey Battle (100 planes) The ship SS Lassell with 14 Hawker Hurricanes on board left Liverpool on 28 August 1939, deliveries from France were also on way when the conflict broke out [11]\n\n\nStrength of Polish Air Force on 1 September 1939\nAfter the fall of Poland, the Polish Air Force started to regroup in France The only complete unit created before the German attack on France was the GC I/145 fighter squadron, flying Caudron C.714 light fighters It was the only unit operating the C.714 at the time The Polish pilots were also deployed to various French squadrons, flying on all types of French fighters, but mostly on the MS-406 After the surrender of France, many of these pilots managed to escape to Britain to continue the fight against the Luftwaffe.\n\n\n1940 (France)\nAfter the fall of Poland, the Polish Air Force started to regroup in France The only complete unit created before the German attack on France was the GC I/145 fighter squadron, flying Caudron C.714 light fighters It was the only unit operating the C.714 at the time The Polish pilots were also deployed to various French squadrons, flying on all types of French fighters, but mostly on the MS-406 After the surrender of France, many of these pilots managed to escape to Britain to continue the fight against the Luftwaffe.\n\n\n1940–1947 (United Kingdom)\nFollowing the fall of France in 1940, Polish units were formed in the United Kingdom, as a part of the Royal Air Force and known as the Polish Air Force (PAF) Four Polish squadrons were formed:\n\n\n1943–1945 (Soviet Union)\nAlong with the Polish People's Army (Ludowe Wojsko Polskie) in the USSR, the Polish People's Air Force (Ludowe Lotnictwo Polskie) was created, in defence of the Soviet Union against Nazi invasion Three regiments were formed in late 1943:\n\n\n1949–1989\nIn 1949, the Li-2sb transport aircraft was adapted into a bomber and in 1950, Poland received Petlyakov Pe-2 and Tupolev Tu-2 bombers from the Soviet Union along with USB-1 and USB-2 training bombers In 1950 also, the Yak-17 fighter came into service, as did the Ilyushin Il-12 transport and the Yak-18 trainer From 1951 onwards, the Polish Air Force was equipped with Yak-23 jet fighters and MiG-15 jets, along with a training version, the MiG-15 UTI, and later, in 1961, the MiG-17.\n\n\nPresent-day operations\nAfter political upheaval and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and a consequent reduction in the state of military anxiety in the whole of Europe, the Polish Air Force saw reductions in size On 1 July 1990 the Polish Air Force and the Air Defence Force were merged again (Wojska Lotnicze i Obrony Powietrznej – WLiOP or WLOP) The attack capability of this force consisted primarily of MiG-21s, MiG-23s, MiG-29s, Su-20s and Su-22s The remaining Lim-6bis were withdrawn in the early 1990s, followed soon afterwards by the withdrawal of the remaining Su-20 aircraft The small number of remaining MiG-23s were withdrawn by 1999 Throughout the 1990s, Poland had not purchased any new combat aircraft and only managed to acquire further MiG-29s from the Czech Republic in 1995 and from Germany in 2004 MiG-21s were finally withdrawn from service in 2003 In 2004, the only remaining combat aircraft flown by the WLiOP were the MiG-29 and the Su-22 As of 2010, the fleet of Su-22s is in need of modernization to retain any value as a combat aircraft and its future is unclear

Born on June 27, 1930, in Sacramento, California, Kono's life was marked by incredible achievements in the world of weightlifting, as well as significant personal struggles and triumphs.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nKono was born to a family of Japanese descent, and as a young child, he suffered from asthma. In 1942, during World War II, his family was forcibly relocated to the Tule Lake internment camp, where many Japanese Americans were detained following the signing of Executive Order 9066. The harsh desert air of the camp proved to be a blessing in disguise for Kono, as it helped alleviate his asthma symptoms.\n\nIt was during his time at the internment camp that Kono was introduced to weightlifting by his neighbors, including Noboru \"Dave\" Shimoda, a member of the Tule Lake weightlifting and bodybuilding club. Shimoda's brother, Yuki Shimoda, was a well-known actor, and Kono's friends, Gotoh, Toda, and Bob Nakanishi, also played a significant role in his early weightlifting career.\n\nAfter spending 3.5 years at the internment camp, Kono's family was released, and he returned to Sacramento, where he attended Sacramento High School. He later worked for the California Department of Motor Vehicles and attended Sacramento Junior College.\n\n**Career**\n\nKono's weightlifting career was nothing short of phenomenal. He won a gold medal at both the 1952 Summer Olympics and 1956 Summer Olympics, and a silver medal at the 1960 Summer Olympics, under the guidance of renowned coach Bob Hoffman. Kono was also a six-time consecutive World Weightlifting Championships winner, from 1953 to 1959, and a three-time Pan American Games champion, in 1955, 1959, and 1963.\n\nKono's impressive career was marked by an incredible 26 world records and seven Olympic records, making him the most accomplished U.S male weightlifter to date. However, his career was not without its challenges. A knee injury prevented him from qualifying for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, and the following year, he retired from the sport.\n\n**Awards and Recognition**\n\nKono's remarkable achievements in weightlifting earned him numerous awards and accolades. Along with his weightlifting and bodybuilding titles, he was an eight-time AAU James E Sullivan Award finalist, an award given annually to the top American amateur athlete. He was also one of the first members of the Hawaii Sports Hall of Fame in 1978, and in 1990, he received the Association of Oldetime Barbell and Strongmen Highest Achievement Award.\n\nIn 1993, Kono was inducted into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame, and in 2005, the International Weightlifting Federation named him the \"Lifter of the Century.\" These honors are a testament to Kono's enduring legacy in the world of weightlifting.\n\n**Portrayals**\n\nKono's life and career have been immortalized in various forms of media. He appeared in Universal Newsreel volume 32, number 63, August 6, 1959, and is depicted as part of a mural located at 37 West Philadelphia Street in York, Pennsylvania. The mural, completed in 2000, is a tribute to Kono's incredible achievements in weightlifting.\n\n**Death**\n\nTommy Kono passed away on April 24, 2016, in Honolulu, Hawaii, at the age of 85, from complications of liver disease. He is survived by his wife of 53 years, Florence Rodrigues, and their three children, as well as three grandchildren.\n\nIn conclusion, Tommy Kono's life was a remarkable journey of triumph and perseverance. His incredible achievements in weightlifting have left an indelible mark on the sport, and his legacy continues to inspire weightlifters around the world. His story is a testament to the power of determination and hard work, and his contributions to the world of weightlifting will never be forgotten.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tommy_Kono\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nKono was born in Sacramento, California, on June 27, 1930 His family was of Japanese descent and were interned at Tule Lake internment camp in 1942 during World War II following the signing of Executive Order 9066 [4] Sickly as a child, the desert air helped Kono's asthma [5] It was during the relocation that Kono was introduced to weightlifting by neighbors including Noboru \"Dave\" Shimoda, a member of the Tule Lake weightlifting and bodybuilding club and brother of actor Yuki Shimoda and his friends, Gotoh, Toda and Bob Nakanishi After 31⁄2 years they were released and Kono finished Sacramento High School He later worked for the California Department of Motor Vehicles and attended Sacramento Junior College [6]\n\n\nCareer\nKono was a gold medalist at both the 1952 Summer Olympics and 1956 Summer Olympics, and a silver medalist at the 1960 Summer Olympics under coach Bob Hoffman Kono won the World Weightlifting Championships six consecutive times from 1953 to 1959 and was a three-time Pan American Games champion; in 1955, 1959, and 1963 [10] A knee injury prevented him from qualifying for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and the following year he retired from the sport [4] He set a total of 26 world records and seven Olympic records, making him the most accomplished U.S male weightlifter to date [11] [12]\n\n\nAwards\nAlong with his weightlifting and bodybuilding titles, Kono was an eight-time AAU James E Sullivan Award finalist, an award given annually to the top American amateur athlete [16] He was also one of the first members of the Hawaii Sports Hall of Fame in 1978 [17] In 1990, Kono received the Association of Oldetime Barbell and Strongmen Highest Achievement Award and was inducted into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame [18] [19] He was elected to the International Weightlifting Federation Hall of Fame in 1993 [20] In 2005, the International Weightlifting Federation named Kono the \"Lifter of the Century.\" [21]\n\n\nPortrayals\nKono appeared in Universal Newsreel volume 32, number 63, August 6, 1959 [22] He is depicted as part of a mural located at 37 West Philadelphia Street in York, Pennsylvania This mural was finished in 2000 [23]\n\n\nDeath\nKono died on April 24, 2016, in Honolulu, Hawaii from complications of liver disease, aged 85 [3] Survivors included his wife of 53 years, the former Florence Rodrigues of Honolulu, three children, and three grandchildren [25]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

lead vocalist has released eighteen studio albums Pitchfork calls the group one of rock's \"most enduring, redoubtable\" bands, with an accomplished discography [25] Though their sound tends to change considerably from one album to another, the one constant of the band is an unpolished blending of disparate genres, and song structures which provide a vehicle for Cave's virtuosic, frequent histrionics Critics Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Steve Huey wrote: \"With the Bad Seeds, Cave continued to explore his obsessions with religion, death, love, America, and violence with a bizarre,

Ink, in 1988 It is a collection of lyrics and plays, including collaborations with Lydia Lunch This was followed up with King Ink II in 1997, containing lyrics, poems, and the transcript of a radio

My Trial (1986) [107]\n\n\nReligion\nCave is an avid reader of the Christian Bible In his recorded lectures on music and songwriting, Cave said that any true love song is a song for God, and ascribed the mellowing of his music to a shift in focus from the Old Testament to the New When asked if he had interest in religions outside of Christianity, Cave quipped that he had a passing, sceptical interest but was a \"hammer-and-nails kind of guy\" [122] Despite this, Cave has also said he is critical of organised religion When interviewed by Jarvis Cocker of Pulp on 12 September 2010, for his BBC Radio 6 show Jarvis Cocker's Sunday Service, Cave said that \"I believe in God in spite of religion, not because of it.\" [123]\n\n\nPolitics\nIn November 2017, Cave was urged by musicians Brian Eno of Roxy Music and Roger Waters of Pink Floyd to cancel two concerts in Tel Aviv, Israel, but he declined, saying \"it suddenly became very important to make a stand against those people who are trying to shut down musicians, to bully musicians, to censor musicians, and to silence musicians.\" [130] This was after Eno and Waters published a letter asking Cave to avoid performing in Israel while \"apartheid remains\" Cave went on to describe the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement as \"cowardly and shameful\", and that calls to boycott the country are \"partly the reason I am playing Israel – not as support for any particular political entity but as a principled stand against those who wish to bully, shame and silence musicians.\" He furthermore responded with an open letter to Eno to defend his position [131] [132] [133]\n\n\nDiscography\nThe APRA Awards are presented annually from 1982 by the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), \"honouring composers and songwriters\" They commenced in 1982 [152]\n\n\nPublications\nThe APRA Awards are presented annually from 1982 by the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), \"honouring composers and songwriters\" They commenced in 1982 [152]\n\n\nPublications by Cave\nThe APRA Awards are presented annually from 1982 by the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), \"honouring composers and songwriters\" They commenced in 1982 [152]\n\n\nPublications with contributions by Cave\nThe APRA Awards are presented annually from 1982 by the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), \"honouring composers and songwriters\" They commenced in 1982 [152]\n\n\nFilms\nThe APRA Awards are presented annually from 1982 by the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), \"honouring composers and songwriters\" They commenced in 1982 [152]\n\n\nExhibitions\nThe APRA Awards are presented annually from 1982 by the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), \"honouring composers and songwriters\" They commenced in 1982 [152]\n\n\nAwards and honours\nThe APRA Awards are presented annually from 1982 by the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), \"honouring composers and songwriters\" They commenced in 1982 [152]\n\n\nAPRA Music Awards\nThe APRA Awards are presented annually from 1982 by the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), \"honouring composers and songwriters\" They commenced in 1982 [152]\n\n\nARIA Music Awards\nThe ARIA Music Awards is an annual awards ceremony that recognises excellence, innovation, and achievement across all genres of Australian music They commenced in 1987.\n\n\nAustralian Music Prize\nThe Australian Music Prize (the AMP) is an annual award of $30,000 given to an Australian band or solo artist in recognition of the merit of an album released during the year of award It commenced in 2005.\n\n\n\nEG Awards / Music Victoria Awards\nThe EG Awards (known as Music Victoria Awards since 2013) are an annual awards night celebrating Victorian music They commenced in 2006.\n\n\n\nGrammy Awards\nThe Grammy Awards are awarded annually by The Recording Academy to honor outstanding achievements in the music industry, and are considered the music industry's highest honor [166]\n\n\n\nJ Awards\nThe J Awards are an annual series of Australian music awards that were established by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's youth-focused radio station Triple J They commenced in 2005.\n\n\n\nOther awards\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Inflation_Reduction_Act_of_2022", "content": "\nBackground\nThe Build Back Better Plan was a legislative framework proposed by United States President Joe Biden between 2020 and 2021 Generally viewed as ambitious in size and scope, it sought to make the largest nationwide public investments in social, infrastructural, and environmental programs since the 1930s Great Depression-fighting policies of the New Deal [17]\n\n\nLegislative history\nThe Build Back Better Act, which passed the House on September 27, 2021, was used by the Senate as the legislative vehicle for this legislation On August 6, 2022 Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer proposed an amendment which would replace the text of the previously passed bill with the text of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 This substitute amendment was later adopted [34]\n\n\nProvisions\nOver a period of 10 years, the law is estimated to raise revenue from: [39] [40] [41]\n\n\nProjected impacts\nThe Congressional Budget Office [77] and others [78] [15] estimated that the Act would have no statistically significant effect on inflation in 2022 and 2023 \n\n\nEconomic\nThe Congressional Budget Office [77] and others [78] [15] estimated that the Act would have no statistically significant effect on inflation in 2022 and 2023 \n\n\nShort-term inflation\nThe Congressional Budget Office [77] and others [78] [15] estimated that the Act would have no statistically significant effect on inflation in 2022 and 2023 \n\n\nMedium-term inflation\nThe nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, [79] alongside the Swiss business lobbying group World Economic Forum [16] analyzed the Act and concluded that the \"deficit reduction, along with other elements of the bill, is likely to reduce inflationary pressures and thus reduce the risk of a possible recession.\" It further estimates that the Act would reduce the federal deficit by $1.9 trillion over a 20-year period [80] [non-primary source needed]\n\n\nDeficit reduction estimates\nThe World Economic Forum estimates that the Act would prevent the federal debt from growing by $1.9 trillion over a 20-year period [80]\n\n\nJobs estimates\nA University of Massachusetts study projects that the law will generate 912,000 jobs per year [80]\n\n\nEnergy and climate change\nThe Inflation Reduction Act is the largest piece of federal legislation ever to address climate change [88] According to the CBO and JCT, it will invest $783 billion in provisions relating to energy security and climate change [7] This includes $663 billion in tax incentives, and $27 billion for a green bank created by amending the Clean Air Act [89] [90] [50] However, other forecasts differ from the CBO's and JCT's reports A report by Credit Suisse projects that the total climate spending in the Act would be $800 billion, [68] [69] [91] Goldman Sachs predicts a total of $1.2 trillion, the Penn Wharton Budget Model predicts $1.045 trillion, and an analysis by the Brookings Institution finds a central case of $902 billion [92] [67] [93]\n\n\nClimate action's fiscal impact\nThe Inflation Reduction Act is the largest piece of federal legislation ever to address climate change [88] According to the CBO and JCT, it will invest $783 billion in provisions relating to energy security and climate change [7] This includes $663 billion in tax incentives, and $27 billion for a green bank created by amending the Clean Air Act [89] [90] [50] However, other forecasts differ from the CBO's and JCT's reports A report by Credit Suisse projects that the total climate spending in the Act would be $800 billion, [68] [69] [91] Goldman Sachs predicts a total of $1.2 trillion, the Penn Wharton Budget Model predicts $1.045 trillion, and an analysis by the Brookings Institution finds a central case of $902 billion [92] [67] [93]\n\n\nAssessments of spending by area\nThe summary provided by Senate Democrats identifies primary goals as driving down consumer energy costs, increasing energy security, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with an emphasis on neutral treatment of technology choice for the energy tax credits, as described by Senator Ron Wyden [21] [22] According to science communicator Hank Green, the largest allocation areas are: $128 billion for renewable energy and grid energy storage, $30 billion for nuclear power, $12 billion for electric vehicle incentives, $14 billion for home energy efficiency upgrades, $22 billion for home energy supply improvements, and $37 billion for advanced manufacturing [56] (The latter amount includes $5.46 billion for a DOE program for zero-emissions industrial tech demonstrations, [57] [58] $10 billion for the renewed 48C tax credit, and more than $5 billion to the USDOT and GSA to lower embedded emissions in procurement [60]) An assortment of additional measures includes $32 billion for investments in rural economies, racial justice in farming, forestlands and coastal habitats, $3 billion in tax incentives for installing carbon capture and storage at existing power plants, $3 billion to electrify the USPS fleet, $3 billion to reconnect neighborhoods harmed by infrastructure potentially via freeway removal, investments in direct air capture, sustainable aviation fuel, grants for high voltage electric power transmission and decarbonization of port equipment, garbage trucks, school buses and local government fleets, and purchases of rural electric cooperative debt alongside other assistance to cooperatives [94] [61] [56] [62] [95] [96] Finally, over $1 billion is allotted to internal reform of agencies, particularly the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (established by the FAST Act in 2015) and Council on Environmental Quality (established by the National Environmental Policy Act in 1969), to speed up environmental reviews for select climate-friendly projects [55]\n\n\nHome energy assistance\nThe Act aims to decrease residential energy costs by focusing on improvements to home energy efficiency Measures include $9 billion in home energy rebate programs that focus on improving access to energy efficient technologies, and 10 years of consumer tax credits for the use of heat pumps, rooftop solar, and high-efficiency electric heating, ventilation, air conditioning and water heating.\n\n\nEnergy production\nThere are also funds allocated to national clean energy production This includes the continuation of the production tax credits (at least $30 billion) [106] and investment tax credit ($10 billion) [107] toward clean energy manufacturing, including solar power, wind power, and grid energy storage Modifications to these credits effectively allow the federal government to predictably and directly pay utility cooperatives, state and local governments, nonprofits and publicly-owned utilities without them needing to attract investment firms, in a manner similar to the Earned Income Tax Credit [108]  [98]\n\n\nHydrogen\nThe Act changes the Section 45V tax credit to offer increased percentages to green hydrogen and pink hydrogen producers for each kilogram produced via electrolysis of water, allowing 100 percent coverage for very low-carbon methods, thus potentially enabling more than $100 billion [68] [109] in forgone revenue to go toward building the hydrogen economy On December 22, 2023, the Treasury Department released its proposed guidance on eligibility It mandates that most of these electrolyzers must be placed near new clean energy production sites (the principles of \"geographic correlation\"/\"deliverability\" and \"additionality\"/\"new supply\"), and run at the same time as peak supply periods (the principle of \"hourly matching\") [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] [109]\n\n\nTransportation\nThe Treasury and Internal Revenue Service published guidance on eligibility for electric vehicle owners to claim tax credits worth between $3,500 and $7,500, including outlining a requirement for the vehicle to undergo final assembly in North America The Department of Energy and the Department of Transportation also published resources identifying vehicles that will likely meet all requirements for tax credits [246] [104] The Department of Energy indicated that their list of eligible vehicles is not a guarantee for credit, and states that the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) will give full manufacturing details and locations [247] Those qualified will receive the tax credit known as the Clean Vehicle Credit, previously called the Qualified Plug-In Electric Drive Motor Vehicle Credit The US Treasury Department has also stated that owners who purchase eligible vehicles previous to August 16, 2022, but did not possess the vehicle until after that date, also qualify for the Clean Vehicle Credit [248] However, because of the requirement that qualified EVs must have half or more of its battery materials built in the US [249] and \"at least 40 percent of materials sourced from North America or a US trading partner by 2024\" (with this minimum percentage meant to increase to 50 percent by 2025, 60 percent by 2026, and 70 percent by 2027) [249] [250] and the batteries cannot contain minerals that \"were extracted, processed, or recycled by a foreign entity of concern\", most currently available EVs on the market will not qualify for the tax credits [251] [252] The Treasury released its next draft guidance for EV buyers on March 31, 2023, effective immediately, with finalization expected in June, and the first update taking place in May 2024; the allowed materials source list includes the 20 United States free-trade agreements partners and Japan [249] [250]\n\n\nAgriculture, forests, marine and rural development\nSome $14 billion of the clean energy package will go to rural areas, and include building biofuel infrastructure [117] [95] This includes $9.5 billion for a new grant program called Empowering Rural America, with cooperatives encouraged to apply during a window from July 31 to September 15, 2023 [126]\n\n\nNovel financing methods\nOne $27 billion competitive grant program is a green bank called the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, intended to capitalize smaller regional green banks [127] The Act established it by amending the Clean Air Act The Fund has awarded $14 billion to a select few green banks nationwide for a broad variety of decarbonization investments, $6 billion to green banks in low-income and historically disadvantaged communities for similar investments, and $7 billion to state and local energy funds for decentralized solar power in communities with no financing alternatives [89] [90] [50] [51] [52] The EPA set the deadline to apply for the first two award initiatives for October 12, 2023 [128] and the Solar for All initiative for September 26, 2023 [129]\n\n\nPollution and emissions\nGlobal carbon dioxide emissions by country in 2023:\n\n\nDrug prices\nThe Biden administration announced the first ten drugs to have their prices negotiated in 2026 by Medicare on August 29, 2023 They are Eliquis, Jardiance, Xarelto, Januvia, Farxiga, Entresto, Enbrel, Imbruvica, Stelara, and Fiasp and NovoLog The list selection, made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, was based on whether these drugs lacked competition, how much they cost Medicare, and how long they have been on the market [150] [154] The manufacturers, Bristol Myers Squibb, Boehringer Ingelheim, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Merck, AstraZeneca, Novartis, Immunex, Pharmacyclics, and Novo Nordisk, had until October 1, 2023 to declare their intent to participate, upon penalty of a large excise tax, or they would withdraw their drugs from Medicaid and Medicare [150] The Biden administration announced two days later that all companies had agreed to the negotiations [273] The administration made its initial offer on February 1, 2024, as part of a negotiation process that continued until August 1, 2024 [274]\n\n\nFirst selected drugs\nIn September 2023, Medicare announced the first 10 drugs selected for negotiations under the agency's drug price negotiation program This list includes treatments for:\n\n\nTaxes and distributional impact\nExcerpts from the nonpartisan JCT indicated that the legislation might lead to increased payments on personal taxes for Americans of all incomes (an increase in $16.7 billion for taxpayers earning less than $200,000 a year, $14.1 billion for taxpayers earning between $200,000 and $500,000, and $23.5 billion for taxpayers earning over $500,000) This calculation was based on the assumption that companies would indirectly pass on parts of the minimum corporate tax to employees, an assumption that was criticized by Steven M Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center (TPC) [156] Economist William G Gale, who is also co-director of the TPC, comments that it is important to consider that the calculations by the JCT did not take into account the provisions in the Act that would extend premium tax credits for health plans for low- and middle-income taxpayers, provide households with tax credits for making their property more energy-efficient, and lower the price of prescription drugs [157]\n\n\nImplementation and results\nThe Biden administration's main overseer of the Act's implementation has been identified as John Podesta [159] [160] From 2022 to 2024, Podesta headed the White House Office on Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation, established by Executive  Order 14082 to implement the Act [161]\n\n\nEconomy\nResearch from climate policy analyst Jack Conness has revealed that $116 billion worth of 181 climate-friendly tech manufacturing investments within the United States, have been announced by companies since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, creating 99,500 projected jobs as of November 14, 2024 [update]; when considered together with CHIPS Act investments, the total comes out to 218 projects worth $388 billion creating 135,800 jobs [162] Conness found that due to the Act's incentives, North Carolina would receive the individual project with the most money ($12.6 billion from Toyota in battery plants), while Georgia would host the most projects (25), the most new jobs overall (14,343), and the largest dollar amount in overall investments ($16 billion, followed by North Carolina's $15.6 billion), and South Carolina would receive the individual project with the most jobs created (4,000 from Scout Motors) More of the Act's dollars went to congressional districts with Republican winners in 2024 ($96 billion) than those with Democratic winners ($17 billion) 68 percent of the Act's investments were in batteries, while electric vehicle investments made up 14 percent and solar investments made up 13 percent [162] [163] [164] Conness found that of the top 20 job-creating IRA-linked projects, only five had faced delays, and a majority would begin production by summer 2025 [162]\n\n\nLabor impact\nIn October 2023, Lee Harris of The American Prospect covered one example of synergies between the Act and the growth of an organizing model known as sectoral bargaining: three unions in solar power construction agreed to a nationwide deal to divide work on future projects (California being exempt because of a similar five-union agreement) [186] On August 16, 2024, the United Steelworkers announced it had successfully reached an electoral neutrality agreement with solar panel manufacturer Convalt, making it easier to form a union at IRA-linked project sites in Pennsylvania and New York [187]\n\n\nFiscal impact\nThe law significantly enlarged the tax credit market It includes significant tax credits for companies making products considered environmentally-friendly, but small companies tend not to pay enough taxes, so the law does not help them The law allows such companies to sell their tax credits to larger companies [98] The market is expected to reach $80 billion per year and help those large companies [191]\n\n\nEnvironment\nAccording to Rhodium Group and the World Economic Forum, in the first year of implementation, the Act had a significant impact on the environment The Rhodium Group's expectations for GHG emissions reductions by the year 2030, relative to the level of 2005, moved from 17–30% to 29–42%, and to a 32–51% decline by the year 2035 More than 170,000 green jobs were created.\n\n\nEnergy and industry\nThe Act deals extensively with trade flows of clean energy and their effects on domestic manufacturing As an example, the Treasury Department clarified on May 12, 2023, that in order to be eligible for the Sections 45, 45Y, 48 and 48E tax credits, [203] solar panel manufacturers and installers need to source at least 40 percent of their components in total from within the U.S., regardless of solar cell origin, thereby creating a compromise between solar panel installers who favored keeping Chinese imports cheap and domestic solar cell manufacturers who want to build more factories in America [204] [205]\n\n\nTransportation\nThe Treasury and Internal Revenue Service published guidance on eligibility for electric vehicle owners to claim tax credits worth between $3,500 and $7,500, including outlining a requirement for the vehicle to undergo final assembly in North America The Department of Energy and the Department of Transportation also published resources identifying vehicles that will likely meet all requirements for tax credits [246] [104] The Department of Energy indicated that their list of eligible vehicles is not a guarantee for credit, and states that the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) will give full manufacturing details and locations [247] Those qualified will receive the tax credit known as the Clean Vehicle Credit, previously called the Qualified Plug-In Electric Drive Motor Vehicle Credit The US Treasury Department has also stated that owners who purchase eligible vehicles previous to August 16, 2022, but did not possess the vehicle until after that date, also qualify for the Clean Vehicle Credit [248] However, because of the requirement that qualified EVs must have half or more of its battery materials built in the US [249] and \"at least 40 percent of materials sourced from North America or a US trading partner by 2024\" (with this minimum percentage meant to increase to 50 percent by 2025, 60 percent by 2026, and 70 percent by 2027) [249] [250] and the batteries cannot contain minerals that \"were extracted, processed, or recycled by a foreign entity of concern\", most currently available EVs on the market will not qualify for the tax credits [251] [252] The Treasury released its next draft guidance for EV buyers on March 31, 2023, effective immediately, with finalization expected in June, and the first update taking place in May 2024; the allowed materials source list includes the 20 United States free-trade agreements partners and Japan [249] [250]\n\n\nEcosystems\nIn 2023 an agreement between seven states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming) [256] was achieved, aiming to preserve the Colorado River water system from collapse due to poor management and climate change The United States is heavily dependent on the river for power generation, drinking water, agriculture, wildlands restoration, and native cultural practices Some states will reduce water use, receiving $1.2 billion in compensation for it from the federal government Many other projects for preserving the river such as water recycling and rainwater harvesting are being advanced The funding comes from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act [257] [258]\n\n\nSustainable agriculture\nFrom October 2022 to September 2023 more than $850 million dollars was given by the Natural Resources Conservation Service to its Environmental Quality Incentives Program, Conservation Stewardship Program, Regional Conservation Partnership Program and Agricultural Conservation Easement Program to advance sustainable agriculture [265]\n\n\nEnvironmental justice\nIn October 2023 the United States Environmental Protection Agency allocated $128 million to 186 projects linked to environmental justice $104 million comes from the Inflation Reduction Act The projects are designed to solve pollution and climate-related disasters in underserved communities The projects include creating parks for addressing floods, protecting Duck Valley Indian Reservation natural and cultural resources, teaching children about repairing [clarification needed] and more [267] The full list of projects with short descriptions has been published [268] [269]\n\n\nDrug prices\nThe Biden administration announced the first ten drugs to have their prices negotiated in 2026 by Medicare on August 29, 2023 They are Eliquis, Jardiance, Xarelto, Januvia, Farxiga, Entresto, Enbrel, Imbruvica, Stelara, and Fiasp and NovoLog The list selection, made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, was based on whether these drugs lacked competition, how much they cost Medicare, and how long they have been on the market [150] [154] The manufacturers, Bristol Myers Squibb, Boehringer Ingelheim, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Merck, AstraZeneca, Novartis, Immunex, Pharmacyclics, and Novo Nordisk, had until October 1, 2023 to declare their intent to participate, upon penalty of a large excise tax, or they would withdraw their drugs from Medicaid and Medicare [150] The Biden administration announced two days later that all companies had agreed to the negotiations [273] The administration made its initial offer on February 1, 2024, as part of a negotiation process that continued until August 1, 2024 [274]\n\n\nHealth insurance subsidies\nThe Inflation Reduction Act extended the American Rescue Plan's modifications to the Affordable Care Act's health insurance subsidies, namely the Advanced Payment for Premium Tax Credit, through 2025 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services attributed increases in ACA health insurance enrollment after the 2022 enrollment period in part to the IRA The 2023 Open Enrollment period, the first one under the IRA, saw an increase in new consumers of 3,699,749, compared to the previous year's increase of 3,066,360 The CMS saw an increase in approvals for financial aid from the Act (90% of consumers compared to 2021's 85%, meaning the Act and ARP helped roughly 14.72 million people in calendar year 2022) and estimated national averages of $824 per year and 46% in IRA savings on premiums, in addition to finding that 1.4 million people making up to four times the poverty line were still able to access subsidies thanks to the ARP and IRA [281] The 2024 Open Enrollment period saw 5,215,764 new consumers sign up for the exchanges, an increase of 31% from the previous year's 3,699,749 92% of consumers (roughly 19.73 million people) received aid from the Act The average annual premium savings figure now stood at $705 and 48%; the ARP and IRA had now helped 1.5 million people avoid subsidy ineligibility [282]\n\n\nIRS reform\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen directed IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to not use the new funding allocated in the Act to increase the rate of audits of those making less than $400,000 a year above historical levels, but to instead focus on \"high-end noncompliance\" [283] A Treasury report indicated that half of the funding would be allocated to preventing tax evasion from large corporations and wealthy individuals [284]\n\n\nPer state\nThe state received $3.75 million for urban forests and nature conservation, $209,000 for fighting pollution, and $78.7 million to protect the state from climate change impacts (the third amount is from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act combined).\n\n\nFlorida\nThe state received $3.75 million for urban forests and nature conservation, $209,000 for fighting pollution, and $78.7 million to protect the state from climate change impacts (the third amount is from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act combined).\n\n\nTexas\nSome aspects of the law are the same as in other states, while some are specific to Texas Considerable tax credits and tax rebates are afforded House weatherization, solar energy, electric vehicles, are advanced House weatherization can save around $283 per year for an average family in Texas, while raising the value of the property and reducing air pollution in the same time Some improvements can be made for free to low income households The cost of an energy audit is reduced by 30% and some can even get it for free [293]\n\n\nAlaska\nIn February 2024, $1 million was delivered to Alaska remote communities The aim is to strengthen resilience and food security, improve cooperation with indigenous tribes, and use their knowledge [296]\n\n\nReactions\nSenator Joe Manchin (D-WV) issued a statement for his support of the bill [297] President Joe Biden also stated his support for the proposed bill [298] On August 4, Senator Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) issued a statement indicating that she would support the bill after striking a deal with fellow Democrats to change several tax provisions [299]\n\n\nPublic organizations\nDarren Woods, the CEO of oil and gas energy giant ExxonMobil, called the bill \"a step in the right direction\" and endorsed its provisions related to oil and gas [304] Multiple coal industry groups, including the West Virginia Coal Association, criticized the bill for \" [obviating] any need to innovate coal assets\" and doing \"nothing for coal or coal generation\" [305]\n\n\nRelationship with foreign policy\nBiden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has been identified as the staffer in charge of ensuring the Act does not conflict with American foreign policy interests [159]\n\n\nImplementation criticisms, concerns\nGeographer and political writer Brett Christophers pointed out, after a renewables project was funded by Brookfield Corporation upon the Act's passage, that asset management companies would likely see the Act as a windfall for taking over public works, citing their poor track records with British and South Korean infrastructure and American housing [330]\n\n\nRelationship with asset managers\nGeographer and political writer Brett Christophers pointed out, after a renewables project was funded by Brookfield Corporation upon the Act's passage, that asset management companies would likely see the Act as a windfall for taking over public works, citing their poor track records with British and South Korean infrastructure and American housing [330]\n\n\nLabor rules\nSome members of the trade union United Auto Workers, including former vice president Cindy Estrada, have obliquely commented to The American Prospect that the Inflation Reduction Act's implementation regarding prevailing wage requirements and collective bargaining rights (particularly at electric vehicle factories owned by startup companies) may be weakened, and if not properly implemented, the Act could be linked to poor hiring practices and working conditions [331] Other labor union representatives, from the AFL–CIO, Southwest Laborers District Council, Ironworkers Local 848 and United Steelworkers, told Reuters in March 2023 that investments announced due to the Act have not improved labor unions' ability to organize particularly in right-to-work law states, but that they were hopeful in pushing ahead [332]\n\n\nEnvironmental justice concerns\nClimate activists Miriam Nielsen, Raya Salter and Heather Tanana examined the Act's effects eight months after passage, and raised questions on whether the Act would provide tax credits and grants equitably, mentioning the home energy upgrade grants and the Biden administration's Justice40 initiative for racial justice, whether the Act would disproportionately help larger environmental groups with more resources rather than smaller ones, and how it would implement $4 billion in Western drought resilience grants and make accessing them easier [333]\n\n\nEV rules\nThe Prospect's editor, Robert Kuttner, commented in January 2023 that the Treasury Department's interpretation of the Act regarding electric vehicle leasing could also potentially undermine the Act's U.S domestic supply provisions in favor of European or Chinese suppliers [159] Manchin expressed disappointment with the Treasury's new guidance and its more lenient provisions for foreign trading partners upon its release on March 31 [249] On December 18, he wrote a letter to Gene Dodaro, head of the Government Accountability Office, asking for a legal opinion on if Congress can overturn the Treasury guidance on Section 30D, on the basis that it is technically a proposal and not finalized, but is being enforced as the latter [334] [335]\n\n\nClean hydrogen rules\nOn December 13, 2023, Manchin also expressed his disappointment with the Biden administration's implementation of his Section 45V tax credit [109] for clean hydrogen after the draft guidelines were leaked, claiming it was \"horrible\" and too stringent beyond his intent for the credit [336] Manchin later said he would bring a lawsuit against the Biden administration upon release of the guidelines Constellation Energy, the United States' largest nuclear power plant operator, said it would pull back on green and pink hydrogen projects if the guidelines were released [337] Staffers for Governor Gavin Newsom (D-CA) also asked the Treasury Department in May 2024 for an \"alternative compliance pathway\" that lifted emissions restrictions on the state's hydrogen hub, ostensibly to better align with their 100% renewable energy adoption goal  [338] Lobbying against the proposed Treasury rules has only intensified since then, according to Pontecorvo [339] In her interview with Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo, Adeyemo promised a \"middle of the road\" approach between environmentalists' and Manchin and lobbyists' concerns, in the run-up to the tax credit's finalization expected by December 2024 [241]\n\n\nSustainable aviation fuel rules\nIn April 2024, the Section 40B tax credit guidance was released While biofuel producers, trade groups and United and American Airlines fully welcomed the guidance, farmers and lower-level ethanol producers said the guidance was too prescriptive and did not reflect the full range of agricultural approaches to climate policy, while environmentalists criticized the guidance for not going far enough to account for all lifecycle emissions from ethanol fuel [125]  [340]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en",

The law aims to reduce inflation, invest in clean energy, and lower healthcare costs for Americans.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Build Back Better Plan was a legislative framework proposed by United States President Joe Biden between 2020 and 2021. The plan sought to make the largest nationwide public investments in social, infrastructural, and environmental programs since the 1930s Great Depression-fighting policies of the New Deal.\n\n**Legislative History**\n\nThe Build Back Better Act, which passed the House on September 27, 2021, was used by the Senate as the legislative vehicle for this legislation. On August 6, 2022, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer proposed an amendment which would replace the text of the previously passed bill with the text of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. This substitute amendment was later adopted.\n\n**Provisions**\n\nThe law is estimated to raise revenue over a period of 10 years from various sources, including:\n\n* Overhauling the tax code to impose a minimum corporate tax rate of 15%\n* Increasing taxes on large corporations and wealthy individuals\n* Closing tax loopholes\n* Implementing a new tax on billionaires\n* Increasing taxes on carried interest\n\n**Projected Impacts**\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office and others estimated that the Act would have no statistically significant effect on inflation in 2022 and 2023. However, the Act is expected to reduce the federal deficit by $1.9 trillion over a 20-year period.\n\n**Economic**\n\nThe Act is expected to create jobs and stimulate economic growth. Research from climate policy analyst Jack Conness has revealed that $116 billion worth of 181 climate-friendly tech manufacturing investments within the United States have been announced by companies since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, creating 99,500 projected jobs.\n\n**Labor Impact**\n\nThe Act is expected to improve labor unions' ability to organize, particularly in right-to-work law states. Labor union representatives, from the AFL–CIO, Southwest Laborers District Council, Ironworkers Local 848, and United Steelworkers, told Reuters in March 2023 that investments announced due to the Act have not improved labor unions' ability to organize, but they were hopeful in pushing ahead.\n\n**Environmental Justice**\n\nThe Act aims to address environmental justice concerns by providing tax credits and grants equitably. Climate activists Miriam Nielsen, Raya Salter, and Heather Tanana examined the Act's effects eight months after passage and raised questions on whether the Act would provide tax credits and grants equitably.\n\n**Transportation**\n\nThe Act includes provisions related to electric vehicle leasing, which could potentially undermine the Act's U.S domestic supply provisions in favor of European or Chinese suppliers. However, the Treasury Department's interpretation of the Act regarding electric vehicle leasing has been subject to criticism and controversy.\n\n**Clean Hydrogen**\n\nThe Act includes provisions related to clean hydrogen, which has been a contentious issue. On December 13, 2023, Senator Manchin expressed his disappointment with the Biden administration's implementation of the Section 45V tax credit for clean hydrogen after the draft guidelines were leaked.\n\n**Sustainable Aviation Fuel**\n\nThe Act includes provisions related to sustainable aviation fuel, which has been a topic of discussion and controversy. In April 2024, the Section 40B tax credit guidance was released, which was welcomed by biofuel producers, trade groups, and airlines but criticized by environmentalists and farmers.\n\n**Healthcare**\n\nThe Act aims to lower healthcare costs for Americans by allowing Medicare to negotiate prices for prescription drugs. The Act also extends the American Rescue Plan's modifications to the Affordable Care Act's health insurance subsidies, which are expected to increase health insurance enrollment.\n\n**Implementation**\n\nThe Act is expected to be implemented over the next several years, with various provisions taking effect at different times. The Treasury Department and other federal agencies will play a key role in implementing the Act's provisions.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe Act has received mixed reactions from various stakeholders, including lawmakers, business leaders, and environmental groups. Some have praised the Act as a step in the right direction, while others have criticized it for being too lenient or too restrictive.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Build Back Better Plan\n* New Deal\n* Great

outline:\n\n\nBackground\nThe Build Back Better Plan was a legislative framework proposed by United States President Joe Biden between 2020 and 2021 Generally viewed as ambitious in size and scope, it sought to make the largest nationwide public investments in social, infrastructural, and environmental programs since the 1930s Great Depression-fighting policies of the New Deal [17]\n\n\nLegislative history\nThe Build Back Better Act, which passed the House on September 27, 2021, was used by the Senate as the legislative vehicle for this legislation On August 6, 2022 Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer proposed an amendment which would replace the text of the previously passed bill with the text of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 This substitute amendment was later adopted [34]\n\n\nProvisions\nOver a period of 10 years, the law is estimated to raise revenue from: [39] [40] [41]\n\n\nProjected impacts\nThe Congressional Budget Office [77] and others [78] [15] estimated

significant effect on inflation in 2022 and 2023 \n\n\nMedium-term inflation\nThe nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, [79] alongside the Swiss business lobbying group World Economic Forum [16] analyzed the Act and concluded that the \"deficit reduction, along with other elements of the bill, is likely to reduce inflationary pressures and thus reduce the risk of a possible recession.\" It further estimates that the Act would reduce the federal deficit by $1.9 trillion over a 20-year period [80] [non-primary source needed]\n\n\nDeficit reduction estimates\nThe World Economic Forum estimates that the Act would prevent the federal debt from growing by $1.9 trillion over a 20-year period [80]\n\n\nJobs estimates\nA University of Massachusetts study projects that the law will generate 912,000 jobs per year [80]\n\n\nEnergy and climate change\nThe Inflation Reduction Act is the largest piece of federal legislation ever to address climate change [88] According to the CBO and JCT, it will invest $783 billion in provisions relating to energy security and climate change [7] This includes $663 billion in tax incentives, and $27 billion for a green bank created by amending the Clean Air Act [89] [90] [50] However, other forecasts differ from the CBO's and JCT's reports A report by Credit Suisse projects that the total climate spending in the Act would be $800 billion, [68] [69] [91] Goldman Sachs predicts a total of $1.2 trillion, the Penn Wharton Budget Model predicts $1.045 trillion, and an analysis by the Brookings Institution finds a central case of $902 billion [92] [67] [93]\n\n\nClimate action's fiscal impact\nThe Inflation Reduction Act is the largest piece of federal legislation ever to address climate change [88] According

of $902 billion [92] [67] [93]\n\n\nAssessments of spending by area\nThe summary provided by Senate Democrats identifies primary goals as driving down consumer energy costs, increasing energy security, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with an emphasis on neutral treatment of technology choice for the energy tax credits, as described by Senator Ron Wyden [21] [22] According to science communicator Hank Green, the largest allocation areas are: $128 billion for renewable energy and grid energy storage, $30 billion for nuclear power, $12 billion for electric vehicle incentives, $14 billion for home energy efficiency upgrades, $22 billion for home energy supply improvements, and $37 billion for advanced manufacturing [56] (The latter amount includes $5.46 billion for a DOE program for zero-emissions industrial tech demonstrations, [57] [58] $10 billion for the renewed 48C tax credit, and more than $5 billion to the USDOT and GSA to lower embedded emissions in procurement [60]) An assortment of additional measures includes $32 billion for investments in rural economies, racial justice in farming, forestlands and coastal habitats, $3 billion in tax incentives for installing carbon capture and storage at existing power plants, $3 billion to electrify the USPS fleet, $3 billion to reconnect neighborhoods harmed by infrastructure potentially via freeway removal, investments in direct air capture, sustainable aviation fuel, grants for high voltage electric power transmission and decarbonization of port equipment, garbage trucks, school buses and local government fleets, and purchases of rural electric cooperative debt alongside other assistance to cooperatives [94] [61] [56] [62] [95] [96] Finally, over $1 billion is allotted to internal reform of agencies, particularly the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (established by the FAST Act in 2015) and Council on Environmental Quality (established by the National Environmental Policy Act in 1969), to speed up environmental reviews for select climate-friendly projects [55]\n\n\nHome energy assistance\nThe Act aims to decrease residential energy costs by focusing on improvements to home energy efficiency Measures include $9 billion in home energy rebate programs that focus on improving access to energy efficient technologies, and 10 years of consumer tax credits for the use of heat pumps, rooftop solar, and high-efficiency electric heating, ventilation, air conditioning and water heating.\n\n\nEnergy production\nThere are also funds allocated to national clean energy production This includes the continuation of the production tax credits (at least $30 billion) [106] and investment tax credit ($10 billion) [107] toward clean energy manufacturing, including solar power, wind power, and grid energy storage Modifications to these credits effectively allow the federal government to predictably and directly pay utility cooperatives, state and local governments, nonprofits and publicly-owned utilities without them needing to attract investment firms, in a manner similar to the Earned Income Tax Credit [108]  [98]\n\n\nHydrogen\nThe Act changes the Section 45V tax credit to offer increased percentages to green hydrogen and pink hydrogen producers for each kilogram produced via electrolysis of water, allowing 100 percent coverage for very low-carbon methods, thus potentially enabling more than $100 billion [68] [109] in forgone revenue to go toward building the hydrogen economy On December 22, 2023, the Treasury Department released its proposed guidance on eligibility It mandates that most of these electrolyzers must be placed near new clean energy production sites (the principles of \"geographic correlation\"/\"deliverability\" and \"additionality\"/\"new supply\"), and run at the same time as peak supply periods (the principle of \"hourly matching\") [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] [109]\n\n\nTransportation\nThe Treasury and Internal Revenue Service published guidance on eligibility for electric vehicle owners to claim tax credits worth between $3,500 and $7,500, including outlining a requirement for the vehicle to undergo final assembly in North America The Department of Energy and the Department of Transportation also published resources identifying vehicles that will likely meet all requirements for tax credits [246] [104] The Department of Energy indicated that their list of eligible vehicles is not a guarantee for credit, and states that the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) will give full manufacturing details and locations [247] Those qualified will receive the tax credit known as the Clean Vehicle Credit, previously called the Qualified Plug-In Electric Drive Motor Vehicle Credit The US Treasury Department has also stated that owners who purchase eligible vehicles previous to August 16, 2022, but did not possess the vehicle until after that date, also qualify for the Clean Vehicle Credit [248] However, because of the requirement that qualified EVs must have half or more of its battery materials built in the US [249] and \"at least 40 percent of materials sourced from North America or a US trading partner by 2024\" (with this minimum percentage meant to increase to 50 percent by 2025, 60 percent by 2026, and 70 percent by 2027) [249] [250] and the batteries cannot contain minerals that \"were extracted, processed, or recycled by a foreign entity of concern\", most currently available EVs on the market will not qualify for the tax credits [251] [252] The Treasury released its next draft guidance for EV buyers on March 31, 2023, effective immediately, with finalization expected in June, and the first update taking place in May 2024; the allowed materials source list includes the 20 United States free-trade agreements partners and Japan [249] [250]\n\n\nAgriculture, forests, marine and rural development\nSome $14 billion of the clean energy package will go to rural areas, and include building biofuel infrastructure [117] [95] This includes $9.5 billion for a new grant program called Empowering Rural America, with cooperatives encouraged to apply during a window from July 31 to September 15, 2023 [126]\n\n\nNovel financing methods\nOne $27 billion competitive grant program is a green bank called the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, intended to capitalize smaller regional green banks [127] The Act established it by amending the Clean Air Act The Fund has awarded $14 billion to a select few green banks nationwide for a broad variety of decarbonization investments, $6 billion to green banks in low-income and historically disadvantaged communities for similar investments, and $7 billion to state and local energy funds for decentralized solar power in communities with no financing alternatives [89] [90] [50] [51] [52] The EPA set the deadline to apply for the first two award initiatives for October 12, 2023 [128] and the Solar for All initiative for September 26, 2023 [129]\n\n\nPollution and emissions\nGlobal carbon dioxide emissions by country in 2023:\n\n\nDrug prices\nThe Biden administration announced the first ten drugs to have their prices negotiated in 2026 by Medicare on August 29, 2023 They are Eliquis, Jardiance, Xarelto, Januvia, Farxiga, Entresto, Enbrel, Imbruvica, Stelara, and Fiasp and NovoLog The list selection, made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, was based on whether these drugs lacked competition, how much they cost Medicare, and how long they have been on the market [150] [154] The manufacturers, Bristol Myers Squibb, Boehringer Ingelheim, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Merck, AstraZeneca, Novartis, Immunex, Pharmacyclics, and Novo Nordisk, had until October 1, 2023 to declare their intent to participate, upon penalty of a large excise tax, or they would withdraw their drugs from Medicaid and Medicare [150] The Biden administration announced two days later that all companies had agreed to the negotiations [273] The administration made its initial offer on February 1, 2024, as part of a negotiation process that continued until August 1, 2024 [274]\n\n\nFirst selected drugs\nIn September 2023, Medicare announced the first 10 drugs selected for negotiations under the agency's drug price negotiation program This list includes treatments for:\n\n\nTaxes and distributional impact\nExcerpts from the nonpartisan JCT indicated that the legislation might lead to increased payments on personal taxes for Americans of all incomes (an increase in $16.7 billion for taxpayers earning less than $200,000 a year, $14.1 billion for taxpayers earning between $200,000 and $500,000, and $23.5 billion for taxpayers earning over $500,000) This calculation was based on the assumption that companies would indirectly pass on parts of the minimum corporate tax to employees, an assumption that was criticized by Steven M Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center (TPC) [156] Economist William G Gale, who is also co-director of the TPC, comments that it is important to consider that the calculations by the JCT did not take into account the provisions in the Act that would extend premium tax credits for health plans for low- and middle-income taxpayers, provide households with tax credits for making their property more energy-efficient, and lower the price of prescription drugs [157]\n\n\nImplementation and results\nThe Biden administration's main overseer of the Act's implementation has been identified as John Podesta [159] [160] From 2022 to 2024, Podesta headed the White House Office on Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation, established by Executive  Order 14082 to implement the Act [161]\n\n\nEconomy\nResearch from climate policy analyst Jack Conness has revealed that $116 billion worth of 181 climate-friendly tech manufacturing investments within the United States, have been announced by companies since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, creating 99,500 projected jobs as of November 14, 2024 [update]; when considered together with CHIPS Act investments, the total comes out to 218 projects worth $388 billion creating 135,800 jobs [162] Conness found that due to the Act's incentives, North Carolina would receive the individual project with the most money ($12.6 billion from Toyota in battery plants), while Georgia would host the most projects (25), the most new jobs overall (14,343), and the largest dollar amount in overall investments ($16 billion, followed by North Carolina's $15.6 billion), and South Carolina would receive the individual project with the most jobs created (4,000 from Scout Motors) More of the Act's dollars went to congressional districts with Republican winners in 2024 ($96 billion) than those with Democratic winners ($17 billion) 68 percent of the Act's investments were in batteries, while electric vehicle investments made up 14 percent and solar investments made up 13 percent [162] [163] [164] Conness found that of the top 20 job-creating IRA-linked projects, only five had faced delays, and a majority would begin production by summer 2025 [162]\n\n\nLabor impact\nIn October 2023, Lee Harris of The American Prospect covered one example of synergies between the Act and the growth of an organizing model known as sectoral bargaining: three unions in solar power construction agreed to a nationwide deal to divide work on future projects (California being exempt because of a similar five-union agreement) [186] On August 16, 2024, the United Steelworkers announced it had successfully reached an electoral neutrality agreement with solar panel manufacturer Convalt, making it easier to form a union at IRA-linked project sites in Pennsylvania and New York [187]\n\n\nFiscal impact\nThe law significantly enlarged the tax credit market It includes significant tax credits for companies making products considered environmentally-friendly, but small companies tend not to pay enough taxes, so the law does not help them The law allows such companies to sell their tax credits to larger companies [98] The market is expected to reach $80 billion per year and help those large companies [191]\n\n\nEnvironment\nAccording to Rhodium Group and the World Economic Forum, in the first year of implementation, the Act had a significant impact on the environment The Rhodium Group's expectations for GHG emissions reductions by the year 2030, relative to the level of 2005, moved from 17–30% to 29–42%, and to a 32–51% decline by the year 2035 More than 170,000 green jobs were created.\n\n\nEnergy and industry\nThe Act deals extensively with trade flows of clean energy and their effects on domestic manufacturing As an example, the Treasury Department clarified on May 12, 2023, that in order to be eligible for the Sections 45, 45Y, 48 and 48E tax credits, [203] solar panel manufacturers and installers need to source at least 40 percent of their components in total from within the U.S., regardless of solar cell origin, thereby creating a compromise between solar panel installers who favored keeping Chinese imports cheap and domestic solar cell manufacturers who want to build more factories in America [204] [205]\n\n\nTransportation\nThe Treasury and Internal Revenue Service published guidance on eligibility for electric vehicle owners to claim tax credits worth between $3,500 and $7,500, including outlining a requirement for the vehicle to undergo final assembly in North America The Department of Energy and the Department of Transportation also published resources identifying vehicles that will likely meet all requirements for tax credits [246] [104] The Department of Energy indicated that their list of eligible vehicles is not a guarantee for credit, and states that the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) will give full manufacturing details and locations [247] Those qualified will receive the tax credit known as the Clean Vehicle Credit, previously called the Qualified Plug-In Electric Drive Motor Vehicle Credit The US Treasury Department has also stated that owners who purchase eligible vehicles previous to August 16, 2022, but did not possess the vehicle until after that date, also qualify for the Clean Vehicle Credit [248] However, because of the requirement that qualified EVs must have half or more of its battery materials built in the US [249] and \"at least 40 percent of materials sourced from North America or a US trading partner by 2024\" (with this minimum percentage meant to increase to 50 percent by 2025, 60 percent by 2026, and 70 percent by 2027) [249] [250] and the batteries cannot contain minerals that \"were extracted, processed, or recycled by a foreign entity of concern\", most currently available EVs on the market will not qualify for the tax credits [251] [252] The Treasury released its next draft guidance for EV buyers on March 31, 2023, effective immediately, with finalization expected in June, and the first update taking place in May 2024; the allowed materials source list includes the 20 United States free-trade agreements partners and Japan [249] [250]\n\n\nEcosystems\nIn 2023 an agreement between seven states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming) [256] was achieved, aiming to preserve the Colorado River water system from collapse due to poor management and climate change The United States is heavily dependent on the river for power generation, drinking water, agriculture, wildlands restoration, and native cultural practices Some states will reduce water use, receiving $1.2 billion in compensation for it from the federal government Many other projects for preserving the river such as water recycling and rainwater harvesting are being advanced The funding comes from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act [257] [258]\n\n\nSustainable agriculture\nFrom October 2022 to September 2023 more than $850 million dollars was given by the Natural Resources Conservation Service to its Environmental Quality Incentives Program, Conservation Stewardship Program, Regional Conservation Partnership Program and Agricultural Conservation Easement Program to advance sustainable agriculture [265]\n\n\nEnvironmental justice\nIn October 2023 the United States Environmental Protection Agency allocated $128 million to 186 projects linked to environmental justice $104 million comes from the Inflation Reduction Act The projects are designed to solve pollution and climate-related disasters in underserved communities The projects include creating parks for addressing floods, protecting Duck Valley Indian Reservation natural and cultural resources, teaching children about repairing [clarification needed] and more [267] The full list of projects with short descriptions has been published [268] [269]\n\n\nDrug prices\nThe Biden administration announced the first ten drugs to have their prices negotiated in 2026 by Medicare on August 29, 2023 They are Eliquis, Jardiance, Xarelto, Januvia, Farxiga, Entresto, Enbrel, Imbruvica, Stelara, and Fiasp and NovoLog The list selection, made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, was based on whether these drugs lacked competition, how much they cost Medicare, and how long they have been on the market [150] [154] The manufacturers, Bristol Myers Squibb, Boehringer Ingelheim, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Merck, AstraZeneca, Novartis, Immunex, Pharmacyclics, and Novo Nordisk, had until October 1, 2023 to declare their intent to participate, upon penalty of a large excise tax, or they would withdraw their drugs from Medicaid and Medicare [150] The Biden administration announced two days later that all companies had agreed to the negotiations [273] The administration made its initial offer on February 1, 2024, as part of a negotiation process that continued until August 1, 2024 [274]\n\n\nHealth insurance subsidies\nThe Inflation Reduction Act extended the American Rescue Plan's modifications to the Affordable Care Act's health insurance subsidies, namely the Advanced Payment for Premium Tax Credit, through 2025 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services attributed increases in ACA health insurance enrollment after the 2022 enrollment period in part to the IRA The 2023 Open Enrollment period, the first one under the IRA, saw an increase in new consumers of 3,699,749, compared to the previous year's increase of 3,066,360 The CMS saw an increase in approvals for financial aid from the Act (90% of consumers compared to 2021's 85%, meaning the Act and ARP helped roughly 14.72 million people in calendar year 2022) and estimated national averages of $824 per year and 46% in IRA savings on premiums, in addition to finding that 1.4 million people making up to four times the poverty line were still able to access subsidies thanks to the ARP and IRA [281] The 2024 Open Enrollment period saw 5,215,764 new consumers sign up for the exchanges, an increase of 31% from the previous year's 3,699,749 92% of consumers (roughly 19.73 million people) received aid from the Act The average annual premium savings figure now stood at $705 and 48%; the ARP and IRA had now helped 1.5 million people avoid subsidy ineligibility [282]\n\n\nIRS reform\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen directed IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to not use the new funding allocated in the Act to increase the rate of audits of those making less than $400,000 a year above historical levels, but to instead focus on \"high-end noncompliance\" [283] A Treasury report indicated that half of the funding would be allocated to preventing tax evasion from large corporations and wealthy individuals [284]\n\n\nPer state\nThe state received $3.75 million for urban forests and nature conservation, $209,000 for fighting pollution, and $78.7 million to protect the state from climate change impacts (the third amount is from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act combined).\n\n\nFlorida\nThe state received $3.75 million for urban forests and nature conservation, $209,000 for fighting pollution, and $78.7 million to protect the state from climate change impacts (the third amount is from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act combined).\n\n\nTexas\nSome aspects of the law are the same as in other states, while some are specific to Texas Considerable tax credits and tax rebates are afforded House weatherization, solar energy, electric vehicles, are advanced House weatherization can save around $283 per year for an average family in Texas, while raising the value of the property and reducing air pollution in the same time Some improvements can be made for free to low income households The cost of an energy audit is reduced by 30% and some can even get it for free [293]\n\n\nAlaska\nIn February 2024, $1 million was delivered to Alaska remote communities The aim is to strengthen resilience and food security, improve cooperation with indigenous tribes, and use their knowledge [296]\n\n\nReactions\nSenator Joe Manchin (D-WV) issued a statement for his support of the bill [297] President Joe Biden also stated his support for the proposed bill [298] On August 4, Senator Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) issued a statement indicating that she would support the bill after striking a deal with fellow Democrats to change several tax provisions [299]\n\n\nPublic organizations\nDarren Woods, the CEO of oil and gas energy giant ExxonMobil, called the bill \"a step in the right direction\" and endorsed its provisions related to oil and gas [304] Multiple coal industry groups, including the West Virginia Coal Association, criticized the bill for \" [obviating] any need to innovate coal assets\" and doing \"nothing for coal or coal generation\" [305]\n\n\nRelationship with foreign policy\nBiden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has been identified as the staffer in charge of ensuring the Act does not conflict with American foreign policy interests [159]\n\n\nImplementation criticisms, concerns\nGeographer and political writer Brett Christophers pointed out, after a renewables project was funded by Brookfield Corporation upon the Act's passage, that asset management companies would likely see the Act as a windfall for taking over public works, citing their poor track records with British and South Korean infrastructure and American housing [330]\n\n\nRelationship with asset managers\nGeographer and political writer Brett Christophers pointed out, after a renewables project was funded by Brookfield Corporation upon the Act's passage, that asset management companies would likely see the Act as a windfall for taking over public works, citing their poor track records with British and South Korean infrastructure and American housing [330]\n\n\nLabor rules\nSome members of the trade union United Auto Workers, including former vice president Cindy Estrada, have obliquely commented to The American Prospect that the Inflation Reduction Act's implementation regarding prevailing wage requirements and collective bargaining rights (particularly at electric vehicle factories owned by startup companies) may be weakened, and if not properly implemented, the Act could be linked to poor hiring practices and working conditions [331] Other labor union representatives, from the AFL–CIO, Southwest Laborers District Council, Ironworkers Local 848 and United Steelworkers, told Reuters in March 2023 that investments announced due to the Act have not improved labor unions' ability to organize particularly in right-to-work law states, but that they were hopeful in pushing ahead [332]\n\n\nEnvironmental justice concerns\nClimate activists Miriam Nielsen, Raya Salter and Heather Tanana examined the Act's effects eight months after passage, and raised questions on whether the Act would provide tax credits and grants equitably, mentioning the home energy upgrade grants and the Biden administration's Justice40 initiative for racial justice, whether the Act would disproportionately help larger environmental groups with more resources rather than smaller ones, and how it would implement $4 billion in Western drought resilience grants and make accessing them easier [333]\n\n\nEV rules\nThe Prospect's editor, Robert Kuttner, commented in January 2023 that the Treasury Department's interpretation of the Act regarding electric vehicle leasing could also potentially undermine the Act's U.S domestic supply provisions in favor of European or Chinese suppliers [159] Manchin expressed disappointment with the Treasury's new guidance and its more lenient provisions for foreign trading partners upon its release on March 31 [249] On December 18, he wrote a letter to Gene Dodaro, head of the Government Accountability Office, asking for a legal opinion on if Congress can overturn the Treasury guidance on Section 30D, on the basis that it is technically a proposal and not finalized, but is being enforced as the latter [334] [335]\n\n\nClean hydrogen rules\nOn December 13, 2023, Manchin also expressed his disappointment with the Biden administration's implementation of his Section 45V tax credit [109] for clean hydrogen after the draft guidelines were leaked, claiming it was \"horrible\" and too stringent beyond his intent for the credit [336] Manchin later said he would bring a lawsuit against the Biden administration upon release of the guidelines Constellation Energy, the United States' largest nuclear power plant operator, said it would pull back on green and pink hydrogen projects if the guidelines were released [337] Staffers for Governor Gavin Newsom (D-CA) also asked the Treasury Department in May 2024 for an \"alternative compliance pathway\" that lifted emissions restrictions on the state's hydrogen hub, ostensibly to better align with their 100% renewable energy adoption goal  [338] Lobbying against the proposed Treasury rules has only intensified since then, according to Pontecorvo [339] In her interview with Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo, Adeyemo promised a \"middle of the road\" approach between environmentalists' and Manchin and lobbyists' concerns, in the run-up to the tax credit's finalization expected by December 2024 [241]\n\n\nSustainable aviation fuel rules\nIn April 2024, the Section 40B tax credit guidance was released While biofuel producers, trade groups and United and American Airlines fully welcomed the guidance, farmers and lower-level ethanol producers said the guidance was too prescriptive and did not reflect the full range of agricultural approaches to climate policy, while environmentalists criticized the guidance for not going far enough to account for all lifecycle emissions from ethanol fuel [125]  [340]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

\"Mitch\" Winehouse, was a window panel installer and taxi driver; her mother, Janis Winehouse (née Seaton), was a pharmacist [10] [11] Her mother was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2003 [12] Winehouse's great-great-grandfather Harris Winehouse emigrated from Minsk, Belarus, to London in 1891 [13] She had an older brother, Alex (born 1979) [14] The family lived in London's Southgate area, [9] where she attended Osidge Primary School and then secondary at Ashmole School [15] [16] Winehouse attended a Jewish Sunday school while she was a child [17] During an interview following her rise to fame, she expressed her disapproval towards the school by saying that she used to beg her father to permit her not to go and that she learned nothing about being Jewish by going anyway [18] In the same interview, Winehouse said she only went to a synagogue once a year on Yom Kippur \"out of respect\" [17]\n\n\nCareer\nWinehouse was signed to Simon Fuller's 19 Management in 2002 and was initially paid £250 a week against future earnings [33] While being developed by the management company, Winehouse was kept as a recording industry secret, [34] although she was a regular jazz standards singer at the Cobden Club [33] Her future A&R representative at Island, Darcus Beese, heard of her by chance when the manager of the Lewinson Brothers showed him some productions of his clients, which featured Winehouse as key vocalist When he asked who the singer was, the manager told him he was not allowed to say Having decided that he wanted to sign her, it took several months of asking around for Beese to eventually discover who the singer was However, by that time Winehouse had already recorded a number of songs, signed a publishing deal with EMI, and formed a working relationship with producer Salaam Remi [34]\n\n\n2002–2005: Career beginnings and Frank\nWinehouse was signed to Simon Fuller's 19 Management in 2002 and was initially paid £250 a week against future

[34]\n\n\n2006–2008: Back to Black and international success\nAfter the release of her first jazz-influenced album, Winehouse's focus shifted to the girl groups of the 1950s and 1960s Winehouse hired New York singer Sharon Jones's longtime band, the Dap-Kings, to back her up in the studio and on tour [42] Mitch Winehouse relates in Amy, My Daughter how fascinating watching her process was: her perfectionism in the studio and how she would put what she had sung on a CD and play it in his taxi outside to know how most people would hear her music [43] In May 2006, Winehouse's demo tracks such as \"You Know I'm No Good\" and \"Rehab\" appeared on Mark Ronson's New York radio show on East Village Radio These were some of the first new songs played on the radio after the release of \"Pumps\" and both were slated to appear on her second album The 11-track album, completed in five months, [43] was produced entirely by Salaam Remi and Ronson, with the production credits being split between them Ronson said in a 2010 interview that he liked working with Winehouse because she was blunt when she did not like his work [44] She in turn thought that when they first met, he was a sound engineer and that she was expecting an older man with a beard [45]\n\n\n2009–2011: Final projects before death\nIn a 2009 poll of U.S residents conducted for VisitBritain by Harris Interactive, one-fifth of the participants indicated they had listened to Winehouse's music during the previous year [98] She performed with Rhythms del Mundo on their cover of the Sam Cooke song \"Cupid\" for an Artists Project Earth benefit album released in July that year [99] [100]\n\n\nOther ventures\nThroughout her life Winehouse donated her money, music and time to numerous charities and causes, particularly those concerned with children [123] She joined a campaign to stop a block of flats being built beside the George Tavern, a famous London East End music venue Campaign supporters feared the residential development would end the spot's lucrative sideline as a film and photo location, on which it relies to survive [124] As part of a breast cancer awareness campaign, Winehouse appeared in a revealing photograph for the April 2008 issue of Easy Living magazine [125] [126] In 2009, she appeared on a CD called Classics alongside musicians such as the Rolling Stones, the Killers and many Cuban musicians to raise awareness of climate change.\n\n\nActivism and philanthropy\nThroughout her life Winehouse donated her money, music and time to numerous charities and causes,

many Cuban musicians to raise awareness of climate change.\n\n\nBusiness\nWinehouse had an estimated £10m fortune, tying her for tenth place in the 2008 The Sunday Times listing of the wealth of musicians under age 30 [133] The following year her fortune had dropped to an estimated £5m [134] Her finances are run by Mitch and Janis Winehouse [135] It was reported she earned about £1m singing at two private parties during Paris Fashion Week [136] as well as another £1m to perform at a Moscow Art Gallery for Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich [137]\n\n\nMedia image\nWinehouse's greatest love was 1960s girl groups [149] Her hairdresser, Alex Foden, borrowed her distinctive beehive hairdo (a weave) from the Ronettes [150] and she borrowed her Cleopatra makeup from the same group [149] Her imitation was so successful, as The Village Voice reports: \"Ronnie Spector—who, it could be argued, all but invented Winehouse's style in the first place when she took the stage at the Brooklyn Fox Theater with her fellow Ronettes more than 40 years ago—was so taken aback at a picture of Winehouse in the New York Post that she exclaimed, \"I don't know her, I never met her, and when I saw that pic, I thought, 'That's me!' But then I found out, no, it's Amy! I didn't have on my glasses.\" [151]\n\n\nControversies\nWinehouse's dichotomous public image of critical and commercial success versus personal turmoil prompted significant media comment The New Statesman called Winehouse \"a filthy-mouthed, down-to-earth diva\", [157] while Newsweek called her \"a perfect storm of sex kitten, raw talent and poor impulse control\" [158] Karen Heller with The Philadelphia Inquirer summarised the maelstrom this way:\n\n\nPersonal life\nWinehouse was raised Jewish and expressed pride in being Jewish, although she was not religious [171] During one interview, Winehouse said: \" [B]eing Jewish to me is about being together as a real family It's not about lighting candles and saying a bracha.\" [17] Winehouse also frequently performed with a Star of David medallion [17]\n\n\nRelationships\nWinehouse dated chef-musician Alex Clare in 2006, while on a break from her on–off boyfriend and future husband, Blake Fielder-Civil She and Clare lived together briefly, [175] and in a pattern that Fielder-Civil would later repeat, Clare sold his story to the News of the World, which published it under the headline \"Bondage Crazed Amy Just Can't Beehive in Bed.\" [176] [177] [178]\n\n\nSubstance abuse and mental illness\nWinehouse's troubles with substance abuse were the subject of much media attention over the years [7] In 2005, she went through a period of drinking, heavy drug use, and weight loss [10] [23] People who saw her during the end of that year and early 2006 reported a rebound that coincided with the writing of Back to Black [23] Her family believes that the mid-2006 death of her grandmother, who was a stabilising influence, set her off into addiction [23] In August 2007, Winehouse cancelled a number of shows in the UK and Europe, citing exhaustion and ill health She was hospitalised during this period for what was reported as an overdose of heroin, ecstasy, cocaine, ketamine and alcohol [198] In various interviews, she admitted to having problems with self-harm, depression, and eating disorders [14] [199]\n\n\nViolence and legal difficulties\nIn 2006, Winehouse admitted to punching a female fan in the face for criticising her having taken Blake Fielder-Civil as a husband She then attacked her own spouse as he attempted to calm her down, kneeing him in the crotch [180] In October 2007, Winehouse and Fielder-Civil were arrested in Bergen, Norway, for possession of seven grams of cannabis The couple were later released and fined 3850 kroner (around £350) [222] Winehouse first appealed the fines, [222] [223] but later dropped the appeal [224]\n\n\nPaparazzi\nWith the paparazzi taking photographs of her wherever they could, Winehouse obtained an injunction against a leading paparazzi agency, Big Pictures, under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997; the resultant court order issued by the High Court in 2009 banned them from following her [238] Photographers were also banned from following her within 100 metres of her London home and photographing Winehouse in her home or the homes of her friends and relatives According to a newspaper report, sources close to the singer said legal action was taken out of concern for the safety of Winehouse and those close to her [238]\n\n\nRespiratory and other health problems\nOn 23 June 2008, Winehouse's publicist corrected earlier misstatements by Mitch Winehouse that his daughter had early-stage emphysema, saying that she instead had signs of what could lead to early-stage emphysema [239] Mitch Winehouse had also stated that his daughter's lungs were operating at 70 percent capacity and that she had an irregular heartbeat He said that these problems had been caused by her chain smoking crack cocaine The singer's father also reported that doctors had warned Winehouse that, if she continued smoking crack cocaine, she would have to wear an oxygen mask and would eventually die [240] In a radio interview, Mitch Winehouse said the singer was responding \"fabulously\" to treatment, which included being covered with nicotine patches [241] British Lung Foundation spokesman Keith Prowse noted that this type of condition could be managed with treatment Prowse also said the condition was not normal for a person her age but \"heavy smoking and inhaling other substances like drugs can age the lungs prematurely.\" [242] Norman H Edelman of the American Lung Association explained that if she stopped smoking, her lung functions would decline at the rate of a normal person, but continued smoking would lead to a more rapid decline in lung function [243]\n\n\nDeath\nWinehouse's bodyguard said that he had arrived at her residence three days before her death and felt she had been somewhat intoxicated Two days after, her mother likewise admitted she had acted \"out of it.\" [248] This was the same day Winehouse had visited her doctor for one of her routine check-ups due to her fragile state, although no abnormalities were noted: \"The doctor was happy with her condition When he left on Friday night he had no concerns Less than 24 hours later she was found dead.\" [249] After the check-up, Winehouse had called her doctor to confess her feelings regarding her codependency, stating: \"I don't want to die\", alongside how she had attempted sobriety, but could not achieve it [250] These were Winehouse's last recorded words, while her bodyguard's final conversation with her included the quote: \"If I could, I would give it back just to walk down the street with no hassle.\" [251]\n\n\nLegacy\nAt the time of her death, Winehouse had sold over 1.75 million singles and over 3.98 million albums in the United Kingdom [276] Meanwhile, she had sold about 3.4 million tracks and 2.7 million albums in the United States as of the same date [277] Among the awards and recognition for her debut album Frank, Winehouse earned an Ivor Novello Award from the British Academy of Songwriters for Best Contemporary Song (\"Stronger Than Me\"), [199] a Brit Award nomination for Best British Female Solo Artist, [278] and an inclusion in Robert Dimery's 2006 book, 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die [279] Her second studio album, Back to Black, produced numerous nominations, including two Brit Awards (Best British Album, and won her Best British Female Solo Artist), six Grammy Awards (including five wins), [280] four Ivor Novello Awards, four MTV Europe Music Awards, three MTV Video Music Awards, three World Music Awards, and it was nominated for the Mercury Prize

United States \"a bit smoother.\" [296] Lady Gaga credited Winehouse with paving the way for her rise to the top of the charts, explaining that Winehouse made it easier for unconventional women to have mainstream pop success [297] Raphael Saadiq, Anthony Hamilton and John Legend said \"Amy Winehouse was produced by people who wanted to create a marketing coup The positive side is that it reacquainted an audience with this music and played an introductory role for others This reinvigorated the genre by overcoming the vintage aspect.\" [298] Other artists that have credited Winehouse as

a glass [321] Another piece, a print titled Celebrity 1 by artist Charlotte Suckling, was shown in the same exhibition [321]\n\n\nArtworks and exhibits\nLondon's Mall Galleries opened an exhibition in

was a regular jazz standards singer at the Cobden Club [33] Her future A&R representative at Island, Darcus Beese, heard of her by chance when the manager of the Lewinson Brothers showed him some productions of his clients, which featured Winehouse as key vocalist When he asked who the singer was, the manager told him he was not allowed to say Having decided that he wanted to sign her, it took several months of asking around for Beese to eventually discover who the singer was However, by that time Winehouse had already recorded a number of songs, signed a publishing deal with EMI, and formed a working relationship with producer Salaam Remi [34]\n\n\n2002–2005: Career beginnings and Frank\nWinehouse was signed to Simon Fuller's 19 Management in 2002 and was initially paid £250 a

Salaam Remi [34]\n\n\n2006–2008: Back to Black and international success\nAfter the release of her first jazz-influenced album, Winehouse's focus shifted to the girl groups of the 1950s and 1960s Winehouse hired New York singer Sharon Jones's longtime band, the Dap-Kings, to back her up in the studio and on tour [42] Mitch Winehouse relates in Amy, My Daughter how fascinating watching her process was: her perfectionism in the studio and how she would put what she had sung on a CD and play it in his taxi outside to know how most people would hear her music [43] In May 2006, Winehouse's demo tracks such as \"You Know I'm No Good\" and \"Rehab\" appeared on Mark Ronson's New York radio show on East Village Radio These were some of the first new songs played on the radio after the release of \"Pumps\" and both were slated to appear on her second album The 11-track album, completed in five months, [43] was produced entirely by Salaam Remi and Ronson, with the production credits being split between them Ronson said in a 2010 interview that he liked working with Winehouse because she was blunt when she did not like his work [44] She in turn thought that when they first met, he was a sound engineer and that she was expecting an older man with a beard [45]\n\n\n2009–2011: Final projects before death\nIn a 2009 poll of U.S residents conducted for VisitBritain by Harris Interactive, one-fifth of the participants indicated they had listened to Winehouse's music during the previous year [98] She performed with Rhythms del Mundo on their cover of the Sam Cooke song \"Cupid\" for an Artists Project Earth benefit album released in July that year [99] [100]\n\n\nOther ventures\nThroughout her life Winehouse donated her money, music and time to numerous charities and causes, particularly those concerned with children [123] She joined a campaign to stop a block of flats being built beside the George Tavern, a famous London East End music venue Campaign supporters feared the residential development would end the spot's lucrative sideline as a film and photo location, on which it relies to survive [124] As part of a breast cancer awareness campaign, Winehouse appeared in a revealing photograph for the April 2008 issue of Easy Living magazine [125] [126] In 2009, she appeared on a CD called Classics alongside musicians such as the Rolling Stones, the Killers and many Cuban musicians to raise awareness of climate change.\n\n\nActivism and philanthropy\nThroughout her life Winehouse donated her money, music and time to numerous charities and

Killers and many Cuban musicians to raise awareness of climate change.\n\n\nBusiness\nWinehouse had an estimated £10m fortune, tying her for tenth place in the 2008 The Sunday Times listing of the wealth of musicians under age 30 [133] The following year her fortune had dropped to an estimated £5m [134] Her finances are run by Mitch and Janis Winehouse [135] It was reported she earned about £1m singing at two private parties during Paris Fashion Week [136] as well as another £1m to perform at a Moscow Art Gallery for Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich [137]\n\n\nMedia image\nWinehouse's greatest love was 1960s girl groups [149] Her hairdresser, Alex Foden, borrowed her distinctive beehive hairdo (a weave) from the Ronettes [150] and she borrowed her Cleopatra makeup from the same group [149] Her imitation was so successful, as The Village Voice reports: \"Ronnie Spector—who, it could be argued, all but invented Winehouse's style in the first place when she took the stage at the Brooklyn Fox Theater with her fellow Ronettes more than 40 years ago—was so taken aback at a picture of Winehouse in the New York Post that she exclaimed, \"I don't know her, I never met her, and when I saw that pic, I thought, 'That's me!' But then I found out, no, it's Amy! I didn't have on my glasses.\" [151]\n\n\nControversies\nWinehouse's dichotomous public image of critical and commercial success versus personal turmoil prompted significant media comment The New Statesman called Winehouse \"a filthy-mouthed, down-to-earth diva\", [157] while Newsweek called her \"a perfect storm of sex kitten, raw talent and poor impulse control\" [158] Karen Heller with The Philadelphia Inquirer summarised the maelstrom this way:\n\n\nPersonal life\nWinehouse was raised Jewish and expressed pride in being Jewish, although she was not religious [171] During one interview, Winehouse said: \" [B]eing Jewish to me is about being together as a real family It's not about lighting candles and saying a bracha.\" [17] Winehouse also frequently performed with a Star of David medallion [17]\n\n\nRelationships\nWinehouse dated chef-musician Alex Clare in 2006, while on a break from her on–off boyfriend and future husband, Blake Fielder-Civil She and Clare lived together briefly, [175] and in a pattern that Fielder-Civil would later repeat, Clare sold his story to the News of the World, which published it under the headline \"Bondage Crazed Amy Just Can't Beehive in Bed.\" [176] [177] [178]\n\n\nSubstance abuse and mental illness\nWinehouse's troubles with substance abuse were the subject of much media attention over the years [7] In 2005, she went through a period of drinking, heavy drug use, and weight loss [10] [23] People who saw her during the end of that year and early 2006 reported a rebound that coincided with the writing of Back to Black [23] Her family believes that the mid-2006 death of her grandmother, who was a stabilising influence, set her off into addiction [23] In August 2007, Winehouse cancelled a number of shows in the UK and Europe, citing exhaustion and ill health She was hospitalised during this period for what was reported as an overdose of heroin, ecstasy, cocaine, ketamine and alcohol [198] In various interviews, she admitted to having problems with self-harm, depression, and eating disorders [14] [199]\n\n\nViolence and legal difficulties\nIn 2006, Winehouse admitted to punching a female fan in the face for criticising her having taken Blake Fielder-Civil as a husband She then attacked her own spouse as he attempted to calm her down, kneeing him in the crotch [180] In October 2007, Winehouse and Fielder-Civil were arrested in Bergen, Norway, for possession of seven grams of cannabis The couple were later released and fined 3850 kroner (around £350) [222] Winehouse first appealed the fines, [222] [223] but later dropped the appeal [224]\n\n\nPaparazzi\nWith the paparazzi taking photographs of her wherever they could, Winehouse obtained an injunction against a leading paparazzi agency, Big Pictures, under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997; the resultant court order issued by the High Court in 2009 banned them from following her [238] Photographers were also banned from following her within 100 metres of her London home and photographing Winehouse in her home or the homes of her friends and relatives According to a newspaper report, sources close to the singer said legal action was taken out of concern for the safety of Winehouse and those close to her [238]\n\n\nRespiratory and other health problems\nOn 23 June 2008, Winehouse's publicist corrected earlier misstatements by Mitch Winehouse that his daughter had early-stage emphysema, saying that she instead had signs of what could lead to early-stage emphysema [239] Mitch Winehouse had also stated that his daughter's lungs were operating at 70 percent capacity and that she had an irregular heartbeat He said that these problems had been caused by her chain smoking crack cocaine The singer's father also reported that doctors had warned Winehouse that, if she continued smoking crack cocaine, she would have to wear an oxygen mask and would eventually die [240] In a radio interview, Mitch Winehouse said the singer was responding \"fabulously\" to treatment, which included being covered with nicotine patches [241] British Lung Foundation spokesman Keith Prowse noted that this type of condition could be managed with treatment Prowse also said the condition was not normal for a person her age but \"heavy smoking and inhaling other substances like drugs can age the lungs prematurely.\" [242] Norman H Edelman of the American Lung Association explained that if she stopped smoking, her lung functions would decline at the rate of a normal person, but continued smoking would lead to a more rapid decline in lung function [243]\n\n\nDeath\nWinehouse's bodyguard said that he had arrived at her residence three days before her death and felt she had been somewhat intoxicated Two days after, her mother likewise admitted she had acted \"out of it.\" [248] This was the same day Winehouse had visited her doctor for one of her routine check-ups due to her fragile state, although no abnormalities were noted: \"The doctor was happy with her condition When he left on Friday night he had no concerns Less than 24 hours later she was found dead.\" [249] After the check-up, Winehouse had called her doctor to confess her feelings regarding her codependency, stating: \"I don't want to die\", alongside how she had attempted sobriety, but could not achieve it [250] These were Winehouse's last recorded words, while her bodyguard's final conversation with her included the quote: \"If I could, I would give it back just to walk down the street with no hassle.\" [251]\n\n\nLegacy\nAt the time of her death, Winehouse had sold over 1.75 million singles and over 3.98 million albums in the United Kingdom [276] Meanwhile, she had sold about 3.4 million tracks and 2.7 million albums in the United States as of the same date [277] Among the awards and recognition for her debut album Frank, Winehouse earned an Ivor Novello Award from the British Academy of Songwriters for Best Contemporary Song (\"Stronger Than Me\"), [199] a Brit Award nomination for Best British Female Solo Artist, [278] and an inclusion in Robert Dimery's 2006 book, 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die [279] Her second studio album, Back to Black, produced numerous nominations, including two Brit Awards (Best British Album, and won her Best British Female Solo Artist), six Grammy Awards (including five wins), [280] four Ivor Novello Awards, four MTV Europe Music Awards, three MTV Video Music Awards, three World Music Awards, and it was nominated for the Mercury Prize

United States \"a bit smoother.\" [296] Lady Gaga credited Winehouse with paving the way for her rise to the top of the charts, explaining that Winehouse made it easier for unconventional women to have mainstream pop success [297] Raphael Saadiq, Anthony Hamilton and John Legend said \"Amy Winehouse was produced by people who wanted to create a marketing coup The positive side is that it reacquainted an audience with this music and played an introductory role for others This reinvigorated the genre by overcoming the vintage aspect.\" [298] Other artists that have credited Winehouse as

to help vulnerable or disadvantaged young people, and it works with other charitable organisations to provide frontline support Its central office is in North London, but it also has an office in New York (operating under the name 'The Amy Winehouse Foundation US') [317] Jon Snow is a patron for the charity, with Barbara Windsor also before she died in 2020, and ambassadors include Jess Glynne, Patsy Palmer, Jessie Wallace, Keira Chaplin and Mica Paris In October 2015 Mark Ronson became a patron [318] Amy's brother Alex works full-time for the foundation, having given up his career as an

for the part, as he felt it was his \"directorial responsibility\" [10] [12] John Mulaney was asked to audition for the role of Kevin after being scouted in a children's sketch comedy group, but his parents refused the opportunity [13] Columbus finally met with Culkin and agreed he was the right choice [10]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography took place from February 14, 1990, to May 8, 1990, over a course of 83 days on an $18.3 million budget [19] [20] [21] The house exterior scenes were filmed on location at a three-story single-family house located at 671 Lincoln Avenue [22] in the North Shore village of Winnetka, Illinois, where many of Hughes' previous films had also been shot, [23] but at different houses The only interiors of the house used for filming that made it to the finished film were the main staircase, basement, attic and most of the first floor landing, [24] while all the other interiors of the house (including the aforementioned rooms) were duplicated on a sound stage to allow more room for equipment and crew These sets were built in the then-disused gym of New Trier High School's west campus, previously used by Hughes for Uncle Buck and Ferris Bueller's Day Off, where the production company had already set up its offices [6] 671 Lincoln Avenue later became a tourist attraction [25] The tree house in the back yard was built specifically for the film and dismantled after filming ended [14]\n\n\nMusic\nColumbus initially hoped to have Bruce Broughton score the film, and early posters listed him as the composer However, Broughton was busy with The Rescuers Down Under (1990), and he had to cancel at the last minute [10] Columbus was later able to get in touch with Steven Spielberg, who helped him contact John Williams to produce the final score [10] Traditional Christmas songs, such as \"O Holy Night\" and \"Carol of the Bells\", are featured prominently in the film, as well as the film's theme song \"Somewhere in My Memory\" The

film, while a title comes on screen reading \"Home Boy Alone\" [104]\n\n\nUse in Poland\nFilms such as Home Alone and Die Hard (1988) are very popular at Christmas time in Poland, because they were

Columbus met with 200 other actors for the part, as he felt it was his \"directorial responsibility.\" John Mulaney was asked to audition for the role of Kevin after being scouted in a children's sketch comedy group, but his parents refused the opportunity. Columbus finally met with Culkin and agreed he was the right choice.\n\nFilming\n\nPrincipal photography took place from February 14, 1990, to May 8, 1990, over a course of 83 days on an $18.3 million budget. The house exterior scenes were filmed on location at a three-story single-family house located at 671 Lincoln Avenue in the North Shore village of Winnetka, Illinois. The only interiors of the house used for filming that made it to the finished film were the main staircase, basement, attic, and most of the first floor landing. All the other interiors of the house were duplicated on a sound stage to allow more room for equipment and crew.\n\nMusic\n\nColumbus initially hoped to have Bruce Broughton score the film, and early posters listed him as the composer. However, Broughton was busy with The Rescuers Down Under, and he had to cancel at the last minute. Columbus was later able to get in touch with Steven Spielberg, who helped him contact John Williams to produce the final score. Traditional Christmas songs, such as \"O Holy Night\" and \"Carol of the Bells,\" are featured prominently in the film, as well as the film's theme song \"Somewhere in My Memory.\" The soundtrack was released by Sony Classical Records on cassette on December 4, 1990, and on CD on May 27, 2015.\n\nRelease\n\nHome Alone premiered in Chicago on November 10, 1990.

Rooms are divided into different categories based on levels of privacy. \"Open rooms\" can be joined by anyone on Clubhouse, and all rooms default to this setting on creation. In \"social rooms\", only users followed by the moderators are allowed to join. To join \"closed rooms\", users need to receive an invite from the moderators.\n\nWithin a room, there are three sections: the \"stage\", \"followed by the speakers\", and \"others in the room\". The profile picture and name of each user present in a room are displayed in the appropriate section. When a user creates a room, they are assigned the role of \"moderator\", which gives them the power to call users to the stage, mute users, and remove speakers from the stage. The moderator role is denoted by a green star that appears next to the user's name.\n\nEvents\n-------\n\nA lot of conversations in Clubhouse are of spontaneous nature. However, users can schedule conversations by creating events. While scheduling an event, users can first name the event and then set the date and time at which the conversation will begin. Users can also add co-hosts to help moderate the event. Once the event has been created, it is added to the Clubhouse \"bulletin\". The bulletin shows upcoming scheduled events and allows users to set notifications for events by clicking the bell icon corresponding to the event.\n\nClubs\n------\n\nAt the Clubhouse, clubs are user communities that regularly discuss a common interest. Many clubs are present in Clubhouse, which represents a wide array of topics. Users can find clubs by name under the search tab. A club consists of three categories of users: \"Admin\", \"Leader\", and \"Member\". Members can create private rooms and invite more users into the club. Leaders have all the privileges of a member, apart from that, they are authorized to create/schedule club-branded open rooms. An admin can modify club settings, add/delete users, change user privileges, and create/schedule any type of room.\n\nThere are three types of clubs: \"Open\", \"By Approval\", and \"Closed\" for membership. Any user can join an open club by pressing the \"Join The Club\" button on the club profile. In case of approval, users need to apply and wait for membership by clicking the \"Apply To Join\" button on the club profile. The admins of the respective club are privileged to accept or reject the user's request.\n\nBackchannel\n------------\n\nBackchannel is the messaging function which allows users to interact individually or within a group via text. The Backchannel feature was initially leaked on June 18, 2021, in response to the launch of Spotify Greenroom. This is a notable step because, until this point, Clubhouse was voice-only with no way to hyperlink or message. It was entirely dependent on Instagram and Twitter for text messaging. The feature was initially leaked in the App Store, which the company says was an accident.\n\nExplore\n--------\n\nThe homepage of Clubhouse provides access to ongoing chat rooms, which are recommended based on the people and clubs that are followed by the user. As the users tap on the magnifying glass icon, they will be redirected to the explore page. On that page, users can search for people and clubs to follow and also find conversations categorized by topics.\n\nClubhouse Payments\n------------------\n\nClubhouse Payments is the direct payment service provided by the app, which allows users to send money to content creators. It includes those users who had enabled this functionality in their profile. Money can be sent to users by clicking on their profile. Just press \"Send Money\" and enter the amount you want to send. When a user does this for the first time, they'll be prompted to register a credit or a debit card. The total received amount will go to the creator. The user will also be charged a small card processing fee as per the Clubhouse's payment processing partner, Stripe.\n\nCreator First\n-------------\n\nClubhouse Creator First is an accelerator program that is intended to help content creators on Clubhouse build their audience and monetize their content with a direct payment system. Creator First paid $5,000 a month to 24 creator shows over 3 months.\n\nIcon\n-----\n\nThe Clubhouse app icon is a regularly changing grayscale profile photo of a social change leader and platform users. This is unique in app development because most companies hire a designer to create an icon, whereas Clubhouse harvests user photos instead.\n\nNotable list of Clubhouse app icons\n----------------------------------\n\nThis functionality allows users to notify others that they are available for a private chat. It was implemented as a way to provide a less scheduled and more personal experience on the app.\n\nWave\n----\n\nThis functionality allows users to notify others that they are available for a private chat.

These recordings can be shared off-platform. The company hoped this would encourage more growth.\n\nPlatforms\n----------\n\nClubhouse app is available on Android as of May 2021 and iOS platforms since launch. Users can download the App from their respective stores. The Android customer requires Android 7 or above to launch the app. iOS consumers need iOS 13 or later to run the app.\n\nTechnical\n----------\n\nThe Clubhouse Android app is written in Kotlin, while the iOS app is written in React Native. The app's backend is written in Python and Django. It runs on a Gunicorn server with HAProxy for load balancing.\n\nBusiness model\n--------------\n\nPresently Clubhouse operates on the funds supplied by its investors. The company intends to monetize the platform via tips, paid events, subscriptions, and connecting creators with different brand partners.\n\nCriticism\n----------\n\nClubhouse records audio in the virtual rooms to support incident investigations. When a discussion is reported of violating Clubhouse's rules, the audio of the associated room will be reviewed by the staff. In the absence of a report, the room's recording is automatically deleted when the session ends. Clubhouse does not explicitly explain the review process.\n\nPrivacy\n--------\n\nClubhouse records audio in the virtual rooms to support incident investigations.

Before the ban, Clubhouse attracted a significant amount of Chinese users to discuss various topics. This included politically sensitive topics, such as protests in Hong Kong and the political status of Taiwan, which became the main reason for the ban.\n\nIn early March 2021, the UAE reportedly throttled access to the app, making access in the country impossible. Later, mid-month, Oman blocked Clubhouse for not having a proper license to operate. Jordan also blocked the app for conducting sensitive conversations late that month.\n\nControversy\n-------------\n\nThe Clubhouse Guidelines forbid the recording, transcription, reproduction, or sharing of conversations without explicit permission. This has been a source of controversy as cases of bullying, harassment, and racism have occurred on the app. Numerous incidents of antisemitism have been reported.\n\nHate rallies\n------------\n\nClubhouse is known to harbor various hate rallies, including those spreading antisemitism, Islamophobia, Hinduphobia, and incel ideology. In May 2021, actor LaKeith Stanfield found himself moderating a room where some users shared antisemitic viewpoints. Complaints were also made in September 2020 and April 2021.\n\nFollowing her anti-Muslim remarks in a room hosted by a PR consultant, far-right Internet personality Laura Loomer was suspended for Islamophobia.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Clubhouse_(app)\" following

for the Chicago Bears and Pittsburgh Pirates Wetzel, who served as general manager, selected the \"Rams\", because his favorite college football team was the Fordham Rams from Fordham University; Marshman, the principal owner, also liked the name choice [16] The team was part of the newly formed American Football League and finished the 1936 regular season in second place with a 5–2–2 record, trailing only the 8–3 record of league champion Boston Shamrocks The team featured players such as William \"Bud\" Cooper, Harry \"The Horse\" Mattos, Stan Pincura, and Mike Sebastian [17]\n\n\nCleveland Rams (1936–1945)\nThe Cleveland Rams were founded in 1936 by Ohio attorney Homer Marshman and player-coach Damon Wetzel, a former Ohio State star who played briefly for the Chicago Bears and Pittsburgh Pirates Wetzel, who served as general manager, selected the \"Rams\", because his favorite college football team was the Fordham Rams from Fordham University; Marshman, the principal owner, also liked the name choice [16] The team was part of the newly formed American Football League and finished the 1936 regular season in second place with a 5–2–2 record, trailing only the 8–3 record of league champion Boston Shamrocks The team featured players such as William \"Bud\" Cooper, Harry \"The Horse\" Mattos, Stan Pincura, and Mike Sebastian [17]\n\n\nNFL champions (1945)\nThe team finally achieved success in 1945, which was their last season in Ohio Adam Walsh took over as head coach that season [24] Quarterback Bob Waterfield, a rookie from UCLA, passed, ran, and place-kicked his way to the league's Most Valuable Player award, which was known as the Joe F Carr Trophy back then, and helped the Rams achieve a 9–1 record and win their first NFL Championship, a 15–14 home field victory over the Washington Redskins on December 16 [25] [26] [27] The margin of victory was provided by a safety: Redskins great Sammy Baugh's pass bounced off the goal post, then backward, through his team's own end zone [28] The next season, NFL rules were changed to prevent this from ever again resulting in a score; instead, it would merely result in an incomplete pass [29]\n\n\nOriginal tenure in Los Angeles (1946–1994)\nOn January 12, 1946, Reeves was denied a request by the other NFL owners to move the Cleveland Rams to Los Angeles and the then-103,000-seat Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum [30] He threatened to end his relationship with the NFL and get out of the professional football business altogether unless the transfer to Los Angeles was permitted [30] [31] [32] A settlement was reached and, as a result, Reeves was allowed to move his team to Los Angeles [30] [33] [34] [35] Consequently, the NFL became the first professional coast-to-coast sports entertainment industry [30]\n\n\nNFL champions (1951)\n\nThe Rams' heyday in Southern California was from 1949 to 1955, when they played in the pre-Super Bowl era NFL Championship Game four times, winning once in 1951 During this period, they had the best offense in the NFL, even though there was a quarterback change from Bob Waterfield to Norm Van Brocklin in 1951 The defining Offensive players of this period were wide receiver Elroy Hirsch, Van Brocklin and Waterfield Teamed with fellow Hall of Famer Tom Fears, Hirsch helped create the style of Rams football as one of the first big play receivers During the 1951 championship season, Hirsch posted a stunning 1,495 receiving yards with 17 touchdowns In 1950 the popularity of this wide-open offense enabled the Los Angeles Rams to become the first pro football team to have all their games televised \n\nChuck Knox/Ray Malavasi years (1973–1982)\nThe Rams' head coach for this run was Chuck Knox, who led the team through 1977 His teams featured unremarkable offenses carried into the playoffs annually by elite defensive units The defining player of the 1970s Los Angeles Rams was Jack Youngblood Youngblood was called the 'Perfect Defensive End' by fellow Hall of Famer Merlin Olsen His toughness was legendary, notably playing on a broken leg during the Rams' run to the 1980 Super Bowl His blue-collar ethic stood in opposition to the perception that the Rams were a soft 'Hollywood' team However, several Rams players from this period took advantage of their proximity to Hollywood and crossed over into acting after their playing careers ended Most notable of these was Fred Dryer, who starred in the TV series Hunter from 1984 to 1991, as well as Olsen, who retired after 1976, starred in Little House on the Prairie During the 1977 off-season, the Rams, looking for a veteran quarterback, acquired Joe Namath from the Jets In spite of a 2–1 start to the regular season, Namath's bad knees rendered him nearly immobile and after a Monday night defeat in Chicago, he never played again With Pat Haden at the helm, the Rams won the division with a 10–4 record and advanced to the playoffs, but lost at home to Minnesota 14–7 [55] [56] Chuck Knox left for the Bills in 1978, after which Ray Malavasi became head coach Going 12–4, the team won the NFC West for the sixth year in a row and defeated the Vikings, thus avenging their earlier playoff defeat [57] [58] However, success eluded them again as they were shut out in the NFC Championship by the Cowboys [59]\n\n\nJohn Robinson years (1983–1991)\nThe hiring of coach John Robinson in 1983 provided a needed boost for pro football in Orange County The former University of Southern California coach began by cutting the aged veterans left over from the 1970s teams His rebuilding program began to show results when the team rebounded to 9–7 in 1983 and defeated Dallas in the playoffs However, the season ended after a rout at the hands of the defending champion Redskins Another trip to the playoffs in 1984 saw them lose to the Giants They made the NFC Championship Game in 1985 after winning the division, where they were shut out by the eventual champion Chicago Bears 24–0.\n\n\nChuck Knox returns (1992–1994)\nRobinson resigned at the end of the 1991 season [71] However, the return of Chuck Knox as head coach, after his successful stints as head coach of the Buffalo Bills and Seattle Seahawks, did not boost the Rams' sagging fortunes [72] In his first season back, he led the team to a 6–10 record in 1992 [73] His run-oriented offense marked the end of the Zampese tenure with a 5–11 record in 1993 [74] Knox's game plans called for an offense that was steady, if unspectacular Unfortunately for the Rams, Knox's offense was not only aesthetically unpleasing but dull as well, especially by 1990s standards The Rams finished last in the NFC West during all three years of Knox's second stint.\n\n\nSt. Louis Rams (1995–2015)\n The 1995 and 1996 seasons, the Rams' first two in St Louis, were under the direction of former Oregon Ducks head coach Rich Brooks The team went 7–9 in 1995 and 6–10 in 1996 [78] [79] Their most prolific player from their first two seasons was the fan favorite Isaac Bruce.\n\n\nDick Vermeil/Mike Martz years (1997–2005)\nIn 1997, Dick Vermeil was hired as the head coach [80] That same year, the Rams traded up in the 1997 NFL draft to select future All-Pro offensive tackle, Orlando Pace [81] The team would struggle to find success in the first two seasons with Vermeil under the helm, going 5–11 in 1997 and 4–12 in 1998 [82] [83]\n\n\nSuper Bowl XXXIV champions (1999)\nThe 1999 season started with quarterback Trent Green injuring his leg in preseason play, which left him sidelined for the entire season; the starting job fell to backup Kurt Warner, who came out of college as an undrafted free agent and whose career had included stints with the Iowa Barnstormers of the Arena Football League and the Amsterdam Admirals of NFL Europe [84] Vermeil told the public that the Rams would \"Rally around Kurt Warner, and play good football.\" Warner synced up with Marshall Faulk and Isaac Bruce to lead the Rams to one of the most prolific offenses in history, posting 526 points for the season This was the beginning of what later became known as \"The Greatest Show on Turf\" Warner shocked the league by throwing for 41 touchdowns This led the Rams to Super Bowl XXXIV, where they beat the Tennessee Titans, 23–16 [85] Warner was named the Most Valuable Player of the Super Bowl [86]\n\n\nReturn to Los Angeles (2016–present)\nOn January 5, 2015, the Los Angeles Times reported that Kroenke and the Stockbridge Capital Group were partnering to develop a new NFL stadium on an Inglewood property owned by Kroenke On February 24, 2015, the Inglewood City Council approved the stadium and the initiative with construction on the stadium planned to begin in December 2015 [111] [112] The Rams moved to their new stadium in Inglewood in 2020.\n\nSean McVay era (2017–present)\nOn January 12, 2017, Washington Redskins offensive coordinator Sean McVay became the new head coach at the age of 30, which made him the youngest in modern NFL history, surpassing Lane Kiffin who was 31 when hired by the Oakland Raiders in 2007 [129]\n\n\nSuper Bowl LVI champions (2021)\nBefore Super Bowl LV was played, the Rams agreed to a blockbuster trade, dealing the inconsistent Jared Goff to the Detroit Lions in exchange for Detroit's own quarterback, Matthew Stafford  Acquiring Stafford came at a steep price, as Los Angeles gave up a 2021 third-round pick and two first-round picks in 2022 and 2023 [180]  The offseason saw more losses, as defensive coordinator Brandon Staley left to become the head coach of the crosstown rival Chargers, while the team also traded Michael Brockers to the Lions, and chose not to retain impending free agents John Johnson, Gerald Everett and Josh Reynolds [181] [182]  The Rams added more depth at wide receiver, signing free agent DeSean Jackson and drafting Tutu Atwell [183] [184]  Another addition came when the team suffered the loss of Cam Akers for the season due to an Achilles injury, and veteran Sony Michel was tapped as the replacement [185] [186]\n\n\nSuper Bowl hangover and retooling (2022–23)\nThe Rams' 2022 season began on a low note; despite opening the season celebrating their Super Bowl victory at home, they were unable to capitalize on two first half turnovers by Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen, falling 31–10 [215]  The next week, they jumped out to a 28–3 lead over the Atlanta Falcons, but had to stave off a furious late comeback attempt by Atlanta, though they held on to win 31–27  They defeated the Cardinals 20–12 on the road before falling flat on the road against the 49ers, 24–9 on Monday Night Football  Los Angeles would continue to struggle offensively the next week, with early miscues against the Dallas Cowboys putting them into a hole they could not recover from, and they lost 22–10  The Rams, however, would even their record after a dominant second half against the Carolina Panthers, winning 24–10.\n\n\nPost-Aaron Donald era (2024)\nOn March 15, 2024, Rams superstar defensive tackle Aaron Donald, widely considered to be the best defensive player in football, announced his retirement [236]  Donald played all ten seasons of his career with the Rams, tallying up 111 sacks, having never missed the Pro Bowl, and being named Defensive Player of the Year three times, tying the all-time NFL record [237] [238]\n\n\nTeam value\nForbes magazine estimated the worth of the team in 2015 as $1.45 billion, which at the time were the 28th most valuable NFL team and 44th most valuable sports team in the world [244] However, after returning to Los Angeles from St Louis, it was estimated by CBS Sports that the team value rose to $2.9 billion (doubling in value) placing them third in the NFL (only behind the Dallas Cowboys and the New England Patriots) [245] [246] In 2021, Forbes released their annual NFL team values list; ranking the Rams fourth at $4.8 billion, behind the Dallas Cowboys, New England

49ers extends back to the 1950s following the inception of the 49ers in 1950 when both teams were original members of the NFC West fighting for dominance across the state of California The rivalry began to grow in intensity during the 1970s when the two clubs would regularly fight for control of the division The 1980s even yielded more notable matchups between the two teams,  predominantly in favor of the 49ers The two teams have met in the postseason 3 times including the 1989 NFC Championship Following the Rams' move to St Louis in 1995, the rivalry did not have the same geographical hatred between San Francisco and Los Angeles, but there were still notable matchups between the two teams as the Rams' re emerged successful in the postseason at the beginning of the millennium The

an appearance the following season During the 2021–22 season, Shanahan's 49ers had previously defeated the Rams in six consecutive regular season games, but McVay's Rams sought retribution as they

the Seahawks switched to the NFC West in 2002 The first notable matchup between the two clubs occurred in the 2004 NFC Wild card round when the Rams defeated the Seahawks in Seattle, 27–20 Much of the intensity waned as the Rams declined throughout the 2000s and early 2010s The intensity of the rivalry found new life during the 2010s as Seattle's Legion Of Boom-era teams often clashed with the Rams' Mob Squad-era teams in a bitter fight for control of the division [291] Some divisional meetings saw random acts of violence on both sides The teams have two Super Bowl wins and seven division titles since 2010 [292] [293] [294] \nTensions ran high during the 2021 Wild Card game following a widely publicized taunt by Seahawks safety Jamal Adams during a postgame conference after a tough win over the Rams during Week 16 The Rams beat the Seahawks in the Wild Card Game, with cornerback Jalen Ramsey and quarterback Jared Goff expressing their satisfaction [295]\n\n\nArizona Cardinals\nOne of the oldest matchups for the Rams as both teams first met during the 1937 NFL season whilst the Rams played in Cleveland, and the Cardinals were still originally located in Chicago The rivalry has resurged in recent years as both teams found playoff success, despite the Cardinals' best efforts; the Rams have been 9–1 since hiring head coach Sean McVay in 2017 The Week 17 matchup of the 2020 season saw both teams playing for a playoff berth; despite the injury to quarterback Jared Goff the Rams managed to pull off a victory over the cardinals in a 7–18 loss that would eliminate them from the postseason The Cardinals' streak would end against the Rams the following season, they would also manage to steal the lead of the NFC from the Rams and start the season 7–0 The following matchup would see the Rams pull off a win on Monday Night Football, the Cardinals would also struggle by losing 6 of 10 games since their 7–0 start The Cardinals would clinch a wild card berth after a week 17 win over the Dallas Cowboys, ironically they would play the Rams in Los Angeles and lose in a 34–11 blowout loss that would see Kyler Murray throw 2 interceptions with one returning for a pick 6 Arizona fans also attribute their hatred of Los Angeles-based sports teams similarly to the Diamondbacks-Dodgers rivalry [297]\nThe Rams own the series 47–39–2 in addition to 2 postseason wins in 1975

Saints once shared a fierce divisional rivalry as the Saints played in the NFC West until the league's realignment in 2002 [301] Animosity resurged between the two teams during the 2010s after the Rams had lured Saints' controversial defensive coordinator Gregg Williams in 2012, shortly before Williams and Saints' head coach Sean Payton would be implicated in the infamous Bountygate Scandal [302] [303] [304] Both teams had thrown insults towards one another in the media, most notably during the controversial 2018 NFC Championship Game, in which a critical pass to Saints' receiver

based in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The team is a member of the West division of the National Football Conference (NFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The Rams have a rich history that spans over 90 years, with their origins dating back to 1936 as the Cleveland Rams.\n\n## History\n\nThe Cleveland Rams were founded in 1936 by Ohio attorney Homer Marshman and player-coach Damon Wetzel, a former Ohio State star who played briefly for the Chicago Bears and Pittsburgh Pirates. Wetzel, who served as general manager, selected the \"Rams\" name because his favorite college football team was the Fordham Rams from Fordham University; Marshman, the principal owner, also liked the name choice.\n\n### Cleveland Rams (1936–1945)\n\nThe Cleveland Rams were part of the newly formed American Football League and finished the 1936 regular season in second place with a 5–2–2 record, trailing only the 8–3 record of league champion Boston Shamrocks. The team featured players such as William \"Bud\" Cooper, Harry \"The Horse\" Mattos, Stan Pincura, and Mike Sebastian.\n\n### Original tenure in Los Angeles (1946–1994)\n\nOn January 12, 1946, Reeves was denied a request by the other NFL owners to move the Cleveland Rams to Los Angeles and the then-103,000-seat Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. He threatened to end his relationship with the NFL and get out of the professional football business altogether unless the transfer to Los Angeles was permitted. A settlement was reached, and as a result, Reeves was allowed to move his team to Los Angeles.\n\n### Chuck Knox/Ray Malavasi years (1973–1982)\n\nThe Rams' head coach for this run was Chuck Knox, who led the team through 1977. His teams featured unremarkable offenses carried into the playoffs annually by elite defensive units. The defining player of the 1970s Los Angeles Rams was Jack Youngblood, who played on a broken leg during the Rams' run to the 1980 Super Bowl.\n\n### John Robinson years (1983–1991)\n\nThe hiring of coach John Robinson in 1983 provided a needed boost for pro football in Orange County. Robinson began by cutting the aged veterans left over from the 1970s teams. His rebuilding program began to show results when the team rebounded to 9–7 in 1983 and defeated Dallas in the playoffs.\n\n### Super Bowl XXXIV champions (1999)\n\nThe 1999 season started with quarterback Trent Green injuring his leg in preseason play, which left him sidelined for the entire season. The starting job fell to backup Kurt Warner, who came out of college as an undrafted free agent and whose career had included stints with the Iowa Barnstormers of the Arena Football League and the Amsterdam Admirals of NFL Europe. Warner synced up with Marshall Faulk and Isaac Bruce to lead the Rams to one of the most prolific offenses in history, posting 526 points for the season.\n\n### Return to Los Angeles (2016–present)\n\nOn January 5, 2015, the Los Angeles Times reported that Kroenke and the Stockbridge Capital Group were partnering to develop a new NFL stadium on an Inglewood property owned by Kroenke. On February 24, 2015, the Inglewood City Council approved the stadium and the initiative with construction on the stadium planned to begin in December 2015. The Rams moved to their new stadium in Inglewood in 2020.\n\n### Sean McVay era (2017–present)\n\nOn January 12, 2017, Washington Redskins offensive coordinator Sean McVay became the new head coach at the age of 30, which made him the youngest in modern NFL history, surpassing Lane Kiffin who was 31 when hired by the Oakland Raiders in 2007.\n\n## Culture\n\nRampage has been the team's official mascot since 2010, being voted by fans whilst the team was still located in St Louis. Rampage has grown a substantial level of enjoyment from Rams fans and players alike given his upbeat, energetic demeanor.\n\n## Fans\n\nDuring the 1980s, fan Lance Goldberg popularized the idea of wearing a watermelon on his head with horns attached to express support for the team, like the Cheesehead headgear of Green Bay Packer fans. Goldberg was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2000 as part of the Hall of Fans.\n\n## Rivalries\n\n### San Francisco 49ers\n\nThe Rams' rivalry with the San Francisco 49ers extends back to the 1950s, when both teams were original members of the NFC West. The rivalry grew in intensity during the 1970s, when the two clubs would regularly fight for control of the division. The 49ers have since won five Super Bowls and have a significant edge over the Rams in the all-time series.\n\n### Seattle Seahawks\n\nThe Rams' rivalry with the Seattle Seahawks began after the Seahawks switched to the NFC West in 2002. The two teams have had several notable matchups, including a 2012 game that was played in a snowstorm.\n\n### Dallas Cowboys\n\nThe Rams have a long-standing rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys, with the two teams having met numerous times over the years.

were founded in 1936 by Ohio attorney Homer Marshman and player-coach Damon Wetzel, a former Ohio State star who played briefly for the Chicago Bears and Pittsburgh Pirates Wetzel, who served as general manager, selected the \"Rams\", because his favorite college football team was the Fordham Rams from Fordham University; Marshman, the principal owner, also liked the name choice [16] The team was part of the newly formed American Football League and finished the 1936 regular season in second place with a 5–2–2 record, trailing only the 8–3 record of league champion Boston Shamrocks The team featured players such as William \"Bud\" Cooper, Harry \"The Horse\" Mattos, Stan Pincura, and Mike Sebastian [17]\n\n\nCleveland Rams (1936–1945)\nThe Cleveland Rams were founded in 1936 by Ohio attorney Homer Marshman and player-coach Damon Wetzel, a former Ohio State star who played briefly for the Chicago Bears and Pittsburgh Pirates Wetzel, who served as general manager, selected the \"Rams\", because his favorite college football team was the Fordham Rams from Fordham University; Marshman, the principal owner, also liked the name choice [16] The team was part of the newly formed American Football League and finished the 1936 regular season in second place with a 5–2–2 record, trailing only the 8–3 record of league champion Boston Shamrocks The team featured players such as William \"Bud\" Cooper, Harry \"The Horse\" Mattos, Stan Pincura, and Mike Sebastian [17]\n\n\nNFL champions (1945)\nThe team finally achieved success in 1945, which was their last season in Ohio Adam Walsh took over as head coach that season [24] Quarterback Bob Waterfield, a rookie from UCLA, passed, ran, and place-kicked his way to the league's Most Valuable Player award, which was known as the Joe F Carr Trophy back then, and helped the Rams achieve a 9–1 record and win their first NFL Championship, a 15–14 home field victory over the Washington Redskins on December 16 [25] [26] [27] The margin of victory was provided by a safety: Redskins great Sammy Baugh's pass bounced off the goal post, then backward, through his team's own end zone [28] The next season, NFL rules were changed to prevent this from ever again resulting in a score; instead, it would merely result in an incomplete pass [29]\n\n\nOriginal tenure in Los Angeles (1946–1994)\nOn January 12, 1946, Reeves was denied a request by the other NFL owners to move the Cleveland Rams to Los Angeles and the then-103,000-seat Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum [30] He threatened to end his relationship with the NFL and get out of the professional football business altogether unless the transfer to Los Angeles was permitted [30] [31] [32] A settlement was reached and, as a result, Reeves was allowed to move his team to Los Angeles [30] [33] [34] [35] Consequently, the NFL became the first professional coast-to-coast sports entertainment industry [30]\n\n\nNFL champions (1951)\n\nThe Rams' heyday in Southern California was from 1949 to 1955, when they played in the pre-Super Bowl era NFL Championship Game four times, winning once in 1951 During this period, they had the best offense in the NFL, even though there was a quarterback change from Bob Waterfield to Norm Van Brocklin in 1951 The defining Offensive players of this period were wide receiver Elroy Hirsch, Van Brocklin and Waterfield Teamed with fellow Hall of Famer Tom Fears, Hirsch helped create the style of Rams football as one of the first big play receivers During the 1951 championship season, Hirsch posted a stunning 1,495 receiving yards with 17 touchdowns In 1950 the popularity of this wide-open offense enabled the Los Angeles Rams to become the first pro football team to have all their games televised \n\nChuck Knox/Ray Malavasi years (1973–1982)\nThe Rams' head coach for this run was Chuck Knox, who led the team through 1977 His teams featured unremarkable offenses carried into the playoffs annually by elite defensive units The defining player of the 1970s Los Angeles Rams was Jack Youngblood Youngblood was called the 'Perfect Defensive End' by fellow Hall of Famer Merlin Olsen His toughness was legendary, notably playing on a broken leg during the Rams' run to the 1980 Super Bowl His blue-collar ethic stood in opposition to the perception that the Rams were a soft 'Hollywood' team However, several Rams players from this period took advantage of their proximity to Hollywood and crossed over into acting after their playing careers ended Most notable of these was Fred Dryer, who starred in the TV series Hunter from 1984 to 1991, as well as Olsen, who retired after 1976, starred in Little House on the Prairie During the 1977 off-season, the Rams, looking for a veteran quarterback, acquired Joe Namath from the Jets In spite of a 2–1 start to the regular season, Namath's bad knees rendered him nearly immobile and after a Monday night defeat in Chicago, he never played again With Pat Haden at the helm, the Rams won the division with a 10–4 record and advanced to the playoffs, but lost at home to Minnesota 14–7 [55] [56] Chuck Knox left for the Bills in 1978, after which Ray Malavasi became head coach Going 12–4, the team won the NFC West for the sixth year in a row and defeated the Vikings, thus avenging their earlier playoff defeat [57] [58] However, success eluded them again as they were shut out in the NFC Championship by the Cowboys [59]\n\n\nJohn Robinson years (1983–1991)\nThe hiring of coach John Robinson in 1983 provided a needed boost for pro football in Orange County The former University of Southern California coach began by cutting the aged veterans left over from the 1970s teams His rebuilding program began to show results when the team rebounded to 9–7 in 1983 and defeated Dallas in the playoffs However, the season ended after a rout at the hands of the defending champion Redskins Another trip to the playoffs in 1984 saw them lose to the Giants They made the NFC Championship Game in 1985 after winning the division, where they were shut out by the eventual champion Chicago Bears 24–0.\n\n\nChuck Knox returns (1992–1994)\nRobinson resigned at the end of the 1991 season [71] However, the return of Chuck Knox as head coach, after his successful stints as head coach of the Buffalo Bills and Seattle Seahawks, did not boost the Rams' sagging fortunes [72] In his first season back, he led the team to a 6–10 record in 1992 [73] His run-oriented offense marked the end of the Zampese tenure with a 5–11 record in 1993 [74] Knox's game plans called for an offense that was steady, if unspectacular Unfortunately for the Rams, Knox's offense was not only aesthetically unpleasing but dull as well, especially by 1990s standards The Rams finished last in the NFC West during all three years of Knox's second stint.\n\n\nSt. Louis Rams (1995–2015)\n The 1995 and 1996 seasons, the Rams' first two in St Louis, were under the direction of former Oregon Ducks head coach Rich Brooks The team went 7–9 in 1995 and 6–10 in 1996 [78] [79] Their most prolific player from their first two seasons was the fan favorite Isaac Bruce.\n\n\nDick Vermeil/Mike Martz years (1997–2005)\nIn 1997, Dick Vermeil was hired as the head coach [80] That same year, the Rams traded up in the 1997 NFL draft to select future All-Pro offensive tackle, Orlando Pace [81] The team would struggle to find success in the first two seasons with Vermeil under the helm, going 5–11 in 1997 and 4–12 in 1998 [82] [83]\n\n\nSuper Bowl XXXIV champions (1999)\nThe 1999 season started with quarterback Trent Green injuring his leg in preseason play, which left him sidelined for the entire season; the starting job fell to backup Kurt Warner, who came out of college as an undrafted free agent and whose career had included stints with the Iowa Barnstormers of the Arena Football League and the Amsterdam Admirals of NFL Europe [84] Vermeil told the public that the Rams would \"Rally around Kurt Warner, and play good football.\" Warner synced up with Marshall Faulk and Isaac Bruce to lead the Rams to one of the most prolific offenses in history, posting 526 points for the season This was the beginning of what later became known as \"The Greatest Show on Turf\" Warner shocked the league by throwing for 41 touchdowns This led the Rams to Super Bowl XXXIV, where they beat the Tennessee Titans, 23–16 [85] Warner was named the Most Valuable Player of the Super Bowl [86]\n\n\nReturn to Los Angeles (2016–present)\nOn January 5, 2015, the Los Angeles Times reported that Kroenke and the Stockbridge Capital Group were partnering to develop a new NFL stadium on an Inglewood property owned by Kroenke On February 24, 2015, the Inglewood City Council approved the stadium and the initiative with construction on the stadium planned to begin in December 2015 [111] [112] The Rams moved to their new stadium in Inglewood in 2020.\n\nSean McVay era (2017–present)\nOn January 12, 2017, Washington Redskins offensive coordinator Sean McVay became the new head coach at the age of 30, which made him the youngest in modern NFL history, surpassing Lane Kiffin who was 31 when hired by the Oakland Raiders in 2007 [129]\n\n\nSuper Bowl LVI champions (2021)\nBefore Super Bowl LV was played, the Rams agreed to a blockbuster trade, dealing the inconsistent Jared Goff to the Detroit Lions in exchange for Detroit's own quarterback, Matthew Stafford  Acquiring Stafford came at a steep price, as Los Angeles gave up a 2021 third-round pick and two first-round picks in 2022 and 2023 [180]  The offseason saw more losses, as defensive coordinator Brandon Staley left to become the head coach of the crosstown rival Chargers, while the team also traded Michael Brockers to the Lions, and chose not to retain impending free agents John Johnson, Gerald Everett and Josh Reynolds [181] [182]  The Rams added more depth at wide receiver, signing free agent DeSean Jackson and drafting Tutu Atwell [183] [184]  Another addition came when the team suffered the loss of Cam Akers for the season due to an Achilles injury, and veteran Sony Michel was tapped as the replacement [185] [186]\n\n\nSuper Bowl hangover and retooling (2022–23)\nThe Rams' 2022 season began on a low note; despite opening the season celebrating their Super Bowl victory at home, they were unable to capitalize on two first half turnovers by Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen, falling 31–10 [215]  The next week, they jumped out to a 28–3 lead over the Atlanta Falcons, but had to stave off a furious late comeback attempt by Atlanta, though they held on to win 31–27  They defeated the Cardinals 20–12 on the road before falling flat on the road against the 49ers, 24–9 on Monday Night Football  Los Angeles would continue to struggle offensively the next week, with early miscues against the Dallas Cowboys putting them into a hole they could not recover from, and they lost 22–10  The Rams, however, would even their record after a dominant second half against the Carolina Panthers, winning 24–10.\n\n\nPost-Aaron Donald era (2024)\nOn March 15, 2024, Rams superstar defensive tackle Aaron Donald, widely considered to be the best defensive player in football, announced his retirement [236]  Donald played all ten seasons of his career with the Rams, tallying up 111 sacks, having never missed the Pro Bowl, and being named Defensive Player of the Year three times, tying the all-time NFL record [237] [238]\n\n\nTeam value\nForbes magazine estimated the worth of the team in 2015 as $1.45 billion, which at the time were the 28th most valuable NFL team and 44th most valuable sports team in the world [244] However, after returning to Los Angeles from St Louis, it was estimated by CBS Sports that the team value rose to $2.9 billion (doubling in value) placing them third in the NFL (only behind the Dallas Cowboys and the New England Patriots) [245] [246] In 2021, Forbes released their annual NFL team values list; ranking the Rams fourth at $4.8 billion, behind the Dallas Cowboys, New England Patriots, and New York Giants [247] The franchise is one of the fastest growing sports teams in the world as the team's resurgent success in Los Angeles helped regrow a steady influx of new fans, and achieved unprecedented year-by-year rankings as previously mentioned [248]\n\n\nCulture\nRampage has been the team's official mascot since 2010, being voted by fans whilst the team was still located in St Louis Rampage has grown a substantial level of enjoyment from

Green Bay Packer fans Goldberg was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2000 as part of the Hall of Fans [255]\n\n\nMelonheads\nDuring the 1980s, fan Lance Goldberg popularized the idea of

2000 as part of the Hall of Fans [255]\n\n\nMobSquad\nDuring the Rams' final season in St Louis in 2015, the team adopted the moniker as \"The Mob Squad\" to tout the strength of their defense (Also, as a group of sheep are formally called a \"mob\".) [256] [257] The team discarded the moniker after 2018, though numerous local booster clubs retain the name to this day, and has been used to refer to the entire fanbase [258] [259] [260]\n\n\nCelebrity fans\nMany Los Angeles-based film and music celebrities have shown support for the Rams before their 1994 departure and since their 2016 return [261] [262] [263] One notable fan is actor Terry Crews, who was drafted by the Rams in 1991 during his brief NFL career [264] [265] Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello named his son after former Rams' quarterback Roman Gabriel [266]\n\n\nNita Strauss\nAnother notable fan is Alice Cooper guitarist Nita Strauss, who joined the Rams' media team and entertainment personnel in 2018 Strauss often performs riffs or interludes at primetime Rams' home games to start crowd chants during breaks Following the Rams' victory in Super Bowl LVI, the organization awarded Strauss a Super Bowl ring [267]\n\n\nNelly\nDuring the team's tenure in St Louis, the success of The Greatest Show on Turf attracted numerous high-profile fans such as local rapper Nelly [268] During the videos for his songs \"Country Grammar\" and \"E.I.\", he regularly wore team gear in support of the team In 2002, Nelly invited numerous Rams players such as Torry Holt and Marshall Faulk to appear in the music video for the song \"Air Force Ones\" [269] Nelly expressed anger at the team's return to Los Angeles in 2016 but continued to display his support for the team [270] [271]\n\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers\nUpon the Rams' return to Los Angeles in 2016, fans were treated to an impromptu pregame concert from hometown icons, the Red Hot Chili Peppers in honor of the team's first regular season game in Los Angeles since 1994 [272] [273] During the band's 1987 music video for their single Fight Like a Brave, former guitarist Hillel Slovak can be seen wearing a Rams hat in one segment [274] The band's ties to the Rams steadily regrew since the performance, bassist Flea has been a particularly notable fan of the team as he is equally as supportive of both the Los Angeles Dodgers, and (most famously) the Los Angeles Lakers [275] Flea and Drummer Chad Smith have owned season tickets since the team's return in 2016, the two can be occasionally spotted at Rams home games at SoFi Stadium [276] In honor of the team's victory in Super Bowl LVI, the band unveiled a limited edition vinyl of their thirteenth studio album Return of the Dream Canteen on October 14, 2022, in the team's colors with a Rams sticker in the sleeve [277] [278] [279] During every Rams home game, Nita Strauss often performs the riff to the song Can't Stop prior to the team entering the field from the tunnel Strauss and former Rams' DJ Mal-ski were known to regularly perform Give It Away prior to the start of the fourth quarter [280] [281]\n\n\nRivalries\nSimilarly to the Dodgers-Giants rivalry of the MLB, the Rams' rivalry with the San Francisco 49ers extends back to the 1950s following the inception of the 49ers in 1950 when both teams were original members of the NFC West fighting for dominance across the state of California The rivalry began to grow in intensity during the 1970s when the two clubs would regularly fight for control of the division The 1980s even yielded more notable matchups between the two teams,  predominantly in favor of the 49ers The two teams have met in the postseason 3 times including the 1989 NFC Championship Following the Rams' move to St Louis in 1995, the rivalry did not have the same geographical hatred between San Francisco and Los Angeles, but there were still notable matchups between the two teams as the Rams' re emerged successful in the postseason at the beginning of the millennium The rivalry regained its geographic animosity following their return to Los Angeles in 2016; exhibiting significant animosity between fans, [282] [283] coaches, [284] and players alike [285] [286] [287] [288] Sports Illustrated considers their rivalry the 8th best of all time in the National Football League [289]  The 49ers and Rams are also the only two teams who have been a members of the NFC West since the division was formed in 1970 Notable recent similarities between the teams include the hiring of two former Washington Redskins offensive staff as head coaches for both clubs Sean McVay and Kyle Shanahan have both been credited with turning their respective teams around and making returns to the postseason; McVay managed to return the Rams to the Super Bowl in 2018, while Shanahan made an appearance the following season During the 2021–22 season, Shanahan's 49ers had previously defeated the Rams in six consecutive regular season games, but McVay's Rams sought retribution as they defeated San Francisco in a crushing last-minute victory in that year's NFC Championship Game The Rams later advanced to win Super Bowl LVI as a result [290]\n\n\nDivisional\nSimilarly to the

last-minute victory in that year's NFC Championship Game The Rams later advanced to win Super Bowl LVI as a result [290]\n\n\nSeattle Seahawks\nThe Rams' rivalry with the Seattle Seahawks began after the Seahawks switched to the NFC West in 2002 The first notable matchup between the two clubs occurred in the 2004 NFC Wild card round when the Rams defeated the Seahawks in Seattle, 27–20 Much of the intensity waned as the Rams declined throughout the 2000s and early 2010s The intensity of the rivalry found new life during the 2010s as Seattle's Legion Of Boom-era teams often clashed with the Rams' Mob Squad-era teams in a bitter fight for control of the division [291] Some divisional meetings saw random acts of violence on both sides The teams have two Super Bowl wins and seven division titles since 2010 [292] [293] [294] \nTensions ran high during the 2021 Wild Card game following a widely publicized taunt by Seahawks safety Jamal Adams during a postgame conference after a tough win over the Rams during Week 16 The Rams beat the Seahawks in the Wild Card Game, with cornerback Jalen Ramsey and quarterback Jared Goff expressing their satisfaction [295]\n\n\nArizona Cardinals\nOne of the oldest matchups for the Rams as both teams first met during the 1937 NFL season whilst the Rams played in Cleveland, and the Cardinals were still originally located in Chicago The rivalry has resurged in recent years as both teams found playoff success, despite the Cardinals' best efforts; the Rams have been 9–1 since hiring head coach Sean McVay in 2017 The Week 17 matchup of the 2020 season saw both teams playing for a playoff berth; despite the injury to quarterback Jared Goff the Rams managed to pull off a victory over the cardinals in a 7–18 loss that would eliminate them from the postseason The Cardinals' streak would end against the Rams the following season, they would also manage to steal the lead of the NFC from the Rams and start the season 7–0 The following matchup would see the Rams pull off a win on Monday Night Football, the Cardinals would also struggle by losing 6 of 10 games since their 7–0 start The Cardinals would clinch a wild card berth after a week 17 win over the Dallas Cowboys, ironically they would play the Rams in Los Angeles and lose in a 34–11 blowout loss that would see Kyler Murray throw 2 interceptions with one returning for a pick 6 Arizona fans also attribute their hatred of Los Angeles-based sports teams similarly to the Diamondbacks-Dodgers rivalry [297]\nThe Rams own the series 47–39–2 in addition to 2 postseason wins in 1975 and 2022 respectively [298]\n\n\nConference\nThe rivalry between the Dallas Cowboys and the Los Angeles Rams became prominent during the 1970s and 1980s The Cowboys met the Rams eight times during that span and split those meetings Two of those matchups decided the NFC's representative in the Super Bowl, with the Cowboys prevailing on both occasions [299] As of the 2023 season, the Cowboys lead the all-time series 20–18, which includes the Rams leading 5–4 in the playoffs [300]\n\n\nDallas Cowboys\nThe rivalry between the Dallas Cowboys and the Los Angeles Rams became prominent during the

Saints once shared a fierce divisional rivalry as the Saints played in the NFC West until the league's realignment in 2002 [301] Animosity resurged between the two teams during the 2010s after the Rams had lured Saints' controversial defensive coordinator Gregg Williams in 2012, shortly before Williams and Saints' head coach Sean Payton would be implicated in the infamous Bountygate Scandal [302] [303] [304] Both teams had thrown insults towards one another in the media, most notably during the controversial 2018 NFC Championship Game, in which a critical pass to Saints' receiver Tommylee Lewis was illegally broken up by Rams' cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman, though no flag was thrown, enraging the Saints for the blown call [305] Saints' receiver Michael Thomas expressed his anger towards the Rams and in regards to the no-call to the media following the game [306] The teams are tied 1–1 in the postseason, but the Rams lead the all-time series 43–35 [307]\n\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers\nThe Rams have also grown a recent rivalry with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as the two teams have faced off numerous times in the postseason; [308] [309] first meeting in the 2022 NFC Divisional round, [310] and in the Conference Championship twice, both in 1979 and 2000 [311] [312] with the Rams winning all 3 matchups The two teams became the first in league history to win a Super Bowl in their home stadiums as Tampa won Super Bowl LV in 2021, and Los Angeles won Super Bowl LVI a year later [313] Both teams combine for four Super Bowl championships as they regularly fought for control of the conference in the early 2000s and 2020s respectively [314] As of the 2023 season, the Rams lead the all-time series 19–10 [315]\n\n\nInter Conference\nInitially considered the \"Battle of Los Angeles\" during the Raiders' tenure in Los Angeles from 1982 to 1994, [316] [317] the rivalry was nonexistent as the Rams had also moved to St Louis the same year The Raiders unsuccessfully attempted to move back to Los Angeles in 2015 after a failed joint stadium project with the then-San Diego Chargers The intercity rivalry was revived only with the Los Angeles Chargers being the city's AFC team following the Rams' return to Los Angeles in 2016, and their move from San Diego in 2017 Hostility erupted between the two clubs during a 2017 joint scrimmage at the Rams' training camp in Irvine, California Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman and Chargers receiver Keenan Allen initiated an altercation and multiple players rushed into the skirmish, creating an uproar from the crowd [318] Following the hiring of coach Sean McVay in 2017, the Rams managed to win back-to-back division titles, including an appearance in Super Bowl LIII during McVay's second season as head coach The Chargers experienced their own playoff success by boasting a 12–4 record in 2018 and making an appearance in the 2018 AFC divisional round but also losing to the New England Patriots The two teams are tied 1–1 in regular season matchups in Los Angeles thus far [319] [320]\n\n\nLos Angeles Raiders/Los Angeles Chargers\nInitially considered the \"Battle of Los Angeles\" during the Raiders' tenure in Los Angeles from 1982 to 1994, [316] [317] the rivalry was nonexistent as the Rams had also moved to St Louis the same year The Raiders unsuccessfully attempted to move back to Los Angeles in 2015 after a failed joint stadium project with the then-San Diego Chargers The intercity rivalry was revived only with the Los Angeles Chargers being the city's AFC team following the Rams' return to Los Angeles in 2016, and their move from San Diego in 2017 Hostility erupted between the two clubs during a 2017 joint scrimmage at the Rams' training camp in Irvine, California Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman and Chargers receiver Keenan Allen initiated an altercation and multiple players rushed into the skirmish, creating an uproar from the crowd [318] Following the hiring of coach Sean McVay in 2017, the Rams managed to win back-to-back division titles, including an appearance in Super Bowl LIII during McVay's second season as head coach The Chargers experienced their own playoff success by boasting a 12–4 record in 2018 and making an appearance in the 2018 AFC divisional round but also losing to the New England Patriots The two teams are tied 1–1 in regular season matchups in Los Angeles thus far [319] [320]\n\n\nHistoric\nThe Rams' rivalry with the Minnesota Vikings was most heated in the 1970s when the two teams faced off in many consequential playoff games To-date, the Vikings are the Rams' second most played playoff opponent with seven games, and the Rams are tied with the Cowboys as the most played playoff opponent for the Vikings [321]\nThe Vikings lead the all-time series 27–18–1 and are 5–2 in the playoffs [322]\n\n\nMinnesota Vikings\nThe Rams' rivalry with the Minnesota Vikings was most heated in the 1970s when the two teams faced off in

the Vikings [321]\nThe Vikings lead the all-time series 27–18–1 and are 5–2 in the playoffs [322]\n\n\nKansas City Chiefs\nWhilst the Rams were in St Louis, the team had an intrastate rivalry with the Kansas City Chiefs, with a trophy being awarded to the winner of each matchup The series ended after the Rams moved back to Los Angeles in 2016, though the teams' game during the 2018 season was the third-highest scoring game of all time, [323] hailed by many as one of the greatest in league history [324] As of the 2023 season, the Chiefs lead the all-time series 8–5 [325]\n\n\nLogos and uniforms\nThe Rams were the first NFL team to have a logo on their helmets [326] Ever since halfback Fred Gehrke, who worked as a commercial artist in off-seasons, painted ram horns on the team's leather helmets in 1948, the logo has been the club's trademark [326]\n\n\nSeason-by-season record\nThe table below shows the five most recent NFL regular season records along with their respective finish in the NFL playoffs [347] The Los Angeles Rams appeared in the postseason in four of the five last seasons, including a Super Bowl championship in the 2021 NFL season and an appearance in the Super Bowl–the first since 2001–after the 2018 NFL season [348] Recent notable honors with current members of the Los Angeles Rams include NFL Coach of the Year in 2017 for Sean McVay, Super Bowl MVP for Cooper Kupp in 2021, and NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 2017, 2018, and 2020 for Aaron Donald [349] [350] [351]\n\n\nNotable players\nRunning backs (RB)\n\n\nCurrent roster\nRunning backs

{"title": "Crewe_Alexandra_F.C.", "content": "\nHistory\nCrewe Alexandra Football Club was formed in 1877 as an offshoot of Crewe Alexandra Cricket Club (established in September 1866 by Thomas Abraham [a] and other workers at Crewe locomotive works), [4] [5] [b] and named after Princess Alexandra [7] [8] They were based at the Alexandra Recreation Ground in Crewe, adjacent to Crewe railway station, and played their first match against a side from Basford in North Staffordshire on 1 December 1877, drawing 1–1 [3] [6] In 1883, Crewe Alexandra's first match in the FA Cup was against Scottish club Queen's Park of Glasgow, losing 10–0 [9] In February 1886, William Bell became the first Crewe player to win an international cap, playing for Wales against Ireland in Wrexham [10] In 1887–88, the club reached the FA Cup semi-finals, defeating Swifts, [11] [c] Derby County and Middlesbrough en route, before going out to Preston North End In 1891, the football club split away from the cricket club—a step that was condemned by Francis Webb, chief engineer of the town's London and North Western Railway (LNWR) Crewe works, who was virulently opposed to professionalism in sport; [13] following the schism, Webb and the LNWR said the company would \"refuse to find employment in the Crewe Works for any professional football player\" [3] Consequently, \"the football section of the Alexandra Club owed little to the LNWR..., despite the teams being closely linked to the local railway industry\" [14] (though one of Webb's successors as LNWR's chief engineer, Charles Bowen Cooke, was \"less intractable\" and \"was President of Crewe Alexandra Football Club and the professional athletics meetings it organised\") [13]\n\n\nFormation and early years\nCrewe Alexandra Football Club was formed in 1877 as an offshoot of Crewe Alexandra Cricket Club (established in September 1866 by Thomas Abraham [a] and other workers at Crewe locomotive works), [4] [5] [b] and named after Princess Alexandra [7] [8] They were based at the Alexandra Recreation Ground in Crewe, adjacent to Crewe railway station, and played their first match against a side from Basford in North

to the local railway industry\" [14] (though one of Webb's successors as LNWR's chief engineer, Charles Bowen Cooke, was \"less intractable\" and \"was President of Crewe Alexandra Football Club and the professional athletics meetings it organised\") [13]\n\n\nPost-World War II\nFrom the 1950s to the early 1980s, Crewe enjoyed only occasional success Looking over Gresty Road, Michael Palin, in the 1980 BBC Great Railway Journeys of the World series, described Crewe as \"like those other railway towns, Swindon and Doncaster, possessed of a football team which is perpetually propping up the bottom of the Fourth Division\" [29] Between 1894 and 1982, Crewe finished last in the Football League eight times, more than any other league club [30] On 25 December 1954, Crewe embarked on a sequence where they did not win away from home for 56 matches; the run ended with a 1–0 win at Southport on 24 April 1957 [31] Crewe finished bottom of Division Three North three times in a row from 1955–56 to 1957–58, tallying just 28, 21 and 23 points from 46 games in each respective season [32] The club was placed into the newly formed Fourth Division in 1958–59 [33]\n\n\n1960s promotions and relegations\nIn 1963, Crewe secured their first promotion to the Third Division, winning the season's final game against Exeter City, with Frank Lord scoring the only goal in front of a crowd of 9,807 at Gresty Road Lord holds the record for most hat-tricks for the club with eight [38] The club finished in third place, behind champions Brentford and Oldham Athletic, but were relegated back to Division Four the following season In the 1964–65 season, Terry Harkin scored a record 34 league goals for Crewe [39] [25] Managed by Ernie Tagg, the club achieved promotion for a second time in 1967–68, but again spent just one season in the Third Division [40]\n\n\n1970s and early 1980s\nFrom 1969, Crewe spent 20 years in Division Four, finishing bottom in 1971–72, 1978–79 and 1981–82, and not achieving a top half finish until 1985 [41] In 1974, they came within two minutes of taking Aston Villa into extra time in a League Cup third round replay at Villa Park [42] In 1977, Tommy Lowry played his record-setting 475th and last game for the Railwaymen; he had earlier passed Peter Leigh's total of 430 appearances between 1960 and 1972 [25] From February to September 1979, the club went a record 16 matches (15 league, one League Cup tie) without winning at Gresty Road [43] In December 1979, manager Tony Waddington signed the goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar who kept eight clean-sheets in his 24 matches played, [44] and, on 5 May 1980, scored a penalty—his only professional goal—to seal a 2–0 victory over York City [45]\n\n\nGradi years (1983–2011)\nIn June 1983, after Crewe finished second from bottom at the end of the 1982–83 season, the then club chairman Norman Rowlinson appointed Milan-born Dario Gradi as manager [46] [47] Gradi looked to build an academy structure to develop players that could be sold to help fund the player development programme [48] Among his early transfer successes were Geoff Thomas and John Pemberton (both signed from Rochdale and sold to Crystal Palace, in 1987 and 1988 respectively), [49] [50] and former Manchester United apprentice David Platt, signed in 1985 and sold to Aston Villa for £200,000 in February 1988 [51]\n\n\nSecond tier survival\nCrewe achieved their highest finishing position, 11th, in the 1997–98 First Division season [25] Gradi kept his team in the division until 2002, despite a matchday income on which many more lowly clubs could not survive Boosting the finances, notable player sales included Lennon (to Leicester City for £750,000), [72] Danny Murphy (to Liverpool for an initial fee of £1.5m), [62] and Seth Johnson (to Derby County for £3m) [73] Gradi celebrated his 1,000th game in charge of Crewe on 20 November 2001 [74]\n\n\nStepping back\nBy the summer of 2007, Gradi was the longest-serving manager in English league football, having completed 24 years in sole charge of the club Crewe announced that, from 1 July 2007, Gradi would take up a new role as the club's technical director while gradually allowing newly appointed first-team coach Steve Holland control of the team [81] Holland's first season was a disappointment as the club narrowly avoided relegation, finishing 20th with 50 points [82] Ahead of his second season, he spent half a million pounds on new signings, while striker Nicky Maynard joined Bristol City for £2.25 million [83] However, despite a positive pre-season, Crewe took only nine points from their first 16 games The board sacked Holland as first team coach in November 2008, and re-appointed Gradi as caretaker manager [84]\n\n\n2011 to present day\nSteve Davis was appointed manager in the same month [90] Previously manager of nearby Nantwich Town, Davis had been appointed assistant manager in June 2009, replacing former assistant Neil Baker [91] Davis immediately led the team to a 16-match unbeaten run in early 2012 up to 7th position, earning the club a play-off place [92] Crewe defeated Southend United in the two-legged semi-final, extending the unbeaten run to a club record 18 matches [93] and securing a play-off final against Cheltenham Town at Wembley on 27 May 2012 which they won 2–0; the goalscorers were academy graduates Nick Powell and Byron Moore [94] [95]\n\n\nStadiums\nUntil 1896, Crewe played at the Alexandra Recreation Ground, located just to the north of the modern-day Gresty Road After playing at various venues in 1896 and 1897, including in nearby Sandbach, the club returned to the same area of Crewe, adjacent to Crewe railway station, to play at the first Gresty Road ground, located to the south-east of the original stadium In 1906 the ground was demolished to make way for some new railway lines, and a new Gresty Road stadium was built on a site directly to the west [20] [128]\n\n\nAlexandra Recreation Ground\nUntil 1896, Crewe played at the Alexandra Recreation Ground, located just to the north of the modern-day Gresty Road After playing at various venues in 1896 and 1897, including in nearby Sandbach, the club returned to the same area of Crewe, adjacent to Crewe railway station, to play at the first Gresty Road ground, located to the south-east of the original stadium In 1906 the ground was demolished to make way for some new railway lines, and a new Gresty Road stadium was built on a site directly to the west [20] [128]\n\n\nGresty Road\nThe pitch runs approximately east to west, with teams playing either west towards Gresty Road or east towards the railway station The main stand has always been situated on the south side of the ground Until the 1990s, the main stand was a wooden structure, built in 1932 after a fire destroyed the original stand, [128] [129] offering the ground's only (wooden) seating plus a standing area―'The Paddock'―while the other three sides were all standing terraces This configuration saw the club's record attendance when 20,000 people watched the FA Cup third round tie against Spurs in 1960 [25]\n\n\nClub identity\nSince the late 1890s, the main (home) Crewe playing strip has featured a red or predominantly red top, usually with white shorts (though red and black shorts have also been briefly adopted) and red socks [145] The team played in white shirts and blue shorts from 1886 to 1896, but have since played mainly in red and white [145] [146] The red shirts earned the early nickname of the \"Robins\", [146] though the club is more commonly referred to as the \"Alex\" or the \"Railwaymen\" (reflecting the club's railway works founders, the town's associations with the railway industry, and the club's proximity to Crewe railway station) [145]\n\n\nSupporters and rivalries\nCrewe is the third largest town in Cheshire: its built-up area had a total population of 76,437 in 2021 [153] Founded by employees of the railway works, the club drew many of its supporters from the works, as well as residents from more rural areas surrounding the town The club's location next to Crewe railway station has also helped supporters travel to and from games at Gresty Road From the 1920s through to the 1960s, attendances typically averaged around 6,000, [154] but local derbies could more than double crowds: the visit of Stoke City on 26 October 1926 attracted 15,102, for example, [155] while Port Vale drew 17,883 on 21 September 1953, [156] Crewe's record league crowd [154] Cup matches against major clubs such as Spurs also drew large crowds (a record 20,000 in 1960) [34] However, league attendances dwindled in the 1970s and 1980s, [157] when seasonal averages of under 2,000 were recorded four times, with 1986-87 being lowest: 1,817; [154] just 1,009 watched a 1–1 draw with Peterborough United on 4 February 1986 [158] Crewe's resurgence from the mid-1980s under Gradi boosted local interest, with 5,000-plus attendances increasingly common, even as Gresty Road's transition to an all-seater stadium began to restrict numbers in the late 1990s; average attendance peaked at 7,741 in 2004 during Crewe's years in the Championship [154] League Two crowds before the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown in 2020 averaged 4,580, [154] just above their all-time average, 4,576 [159]\n\n\nAttendances\nCrewe is the third

pandemic shutdown in 2020 averaged 4,580, [154] just above their all-time average, 4,576 [159]\n\n\nRivalries\nCrewe's main rivals are fellow English Football League team Port Vale As of June 2023, the clubs have played 81 games since 1892 (8 games against Burslem Port Vale); overall, Crewe have won 20 games, Port Vale have won 38, with the teams drawing 23 games [162] [163] The rivalry (known by some since the 1980s as the A500 Derby) intensified after the millennium, when both clubs were in Leagues One and Two, with close encounters sometimes resulting in violence and arrests [164] [165] On 22 February 2014, Crewe beat Vale 3–1, at Vale Park and there was trouble before, during and after the game, with several arrests made and flares thrown on the pitch [166] In January 2015 at Vale Park, Crewe won 1–0 to seal their first league double over Port Vale, and two arrests were made at the game, with minor disturbances between rival fans after the match [167] Six arrests were made at Gresty Road during the 22 September 2018 meeting between the two sides [168] A 2019 study ranked the Port Vale-Crewe Alexandra rivalry as the 14th biggest rivalry in English professional football [169]\n\n\nSongs and music\nCrewe's fans were the first to sing the song \"Blue Moon\" [172]―also sung by fans of Manchester City―(with lyrics that do not quite match the Rodgers and Hart original) and said to be a response to the gloomy days of the 1950s and 1960s, [173] or reflecting an old joke that the team only wins 'once in a blue moon', i.e., rarely [174] During the 1990s, one Crewe supporter, classically trained musician Richard Sutton, was known for taking a trumpet to games, [175] playing occasional fanfares such as the theme from Star Wars during matches [176] The Crewe-based dance trio Dario G were named after Dario Gradi [177] [178]\n\n\nRailwaymen Supporters Society\nCrewe supporters often sing a song featuring the line \"We are the Railwaymen\" Aggregating and formalising several former Crewe supporters groups, and supported by the national Football Supporters' Association, the independent Railwaymen Supporters Society was established in 2018, and incorporated as a community benefit society on 8 July 2019 [179] [180] Initiatives have included a campaign, Project250, to raise £250,000 to invest in club shares and gain representation on the club's board (achieved in February 2020), [181] and the establishment of an Ex-Players Association (Gareth Whalley is its president) [182]\n\n\nReputation\nAs an early professional club in the late 19th century, several Crewe players achieved international selection, particularly for Wales During the 20th century, however, Crewe had few stars Welsh international Fred Keenor played his final league games for the club and his last international cap in 1932 was Crewe's first of the century [24] Some players started or developed their careers at Crewe before achieving fame elsewhere For example, forward Frank Blunstone played 48 League games for Crewe in the early 1950s before a move to Chelsea and five England caps, [183] Stan Bowles scored 18 Crewe goals in 51 games in the early 1970s and went on to play for Queens Park Rangers and England, [184] and goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar played 24 Crewe matches at the start of the 1980s before moving to Liverpool [45]\n\n\nPlayer

1980s before moving to Liverpool [45]\n\n\nSexual abuse scandal\nOn 16 November 2016, former Crewe defender Andy Woodward revealed that he had been the victim of child sexual abuse by former football coach Barry Bennell (convicted as a paedophile in the US in 1994) at the club in the 1980s [193] [194] By the time club chairman John Bowler responded to the revelations, on Monday 21 November, six other individuals had contacted the police, [195] with Woodward's Crewe teammate Steve Walters alleging he was another of Bennell's victims [196] Woodward criticised Crewe for failing to apologise [197] On 27 November 2016, a third former Crewe player, Anthony Hughes, revealed that he too had been abused by Bennell, [198] as did Crewe trainee, later Wimbledon and Northern Ireland international Mark Williams [199] [200]\n\n\nRecords\nCrewe's biggest league victory came against Rotherham United on 1 October 1932 in the Third Division North when they won 8–0 [226] In the FA Cup, their biggest win was 9–1 over Northwich Victoria on 16 November 1889 [227] The club's heaviest defeat was in the FA Cup in 1960 when they were beaten 13–2 by Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on 30 January 1960, [25] a game watched by 64,365: the largest crowd for a match involving Crewe [228] In the league, Crewe's worst performance saw them beaten 11–1 at Lincoln City on 29 September 1951 in the Third Division North [229]\n\n\nPlayers\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nCurrent squad\nNote: Flags

football clubs in England and Scotland to vote for their cult hero For Crewe, Seth Johnson won with 59% of the vote; Danny Murphy came second with 33%, and Craig Hignett third with 8% [237]\n\n\nFull international players\nWilliam Bell was the first Crewe player to win an international cap, playing for Wales against Ireland in Wrexham in February 1886 [10] On 15 March 1890, three Crewe players – Alfred Davies (also Wales captain), Dick Jones and Billy Lewis – played in Wales's 3–1 defeat by England in Wrexham; [238] Lewis scored Wales's goal, [239] the first international goal scored by a Crewe player John 'Jackie' Pearson became the first Crewe player to win an international cap for England, playing against Ireland in Belfast on 5 March 1892 [15] [16] He remains the only Crewe player capped for England while playing at the club [17] Donervon Daniels was the most recent Crewe player to win a full international cap; he played for Montserrat in their FIFA World Cup 2022 qualifier against US Virgin Islands on 2 June 2021 [240]\n\n\nManagement\nSince 1892, 29 men have managed Crewe Dario Gradi holds the record for the most games: 1,359 first team games [258] Two Crewe managers

"Crewe Alexandra Football Club\n\nCrewe Alexandra Football Club is a professional football club based in Crewe, Cheshire, England. The club was formed in 1877 and has a rich history in English football. The club has played in various leagues and competitions over the years, including the Football League, FA Cup, and League Cup.\n\nHistory\n---------\n\nCrewe Alexandra Football Club was formed in 1877 as an offshoot of Crewe Alexandra Cricket Club, which was established in September 1866 by Thomas Abraham and other workers at Crewe locomotive works. The club was named after Princess Alexandra, and the first match was played against a side from Basford in North Staffordshire on 1 December 1877, drawing 1–1. In 1883, Crewe Alexandra's first match in the FA Cup was against Scottish club Queen's Park of Glasgow, losing 10–0. In February 1886, William Bell became the first Crewe player to win an international cap, playing for Wales against Ireland in Wrexham. In 1887–88, the club reached the FA Cup semi-finals, defeating Swifts, Derby County, and Middlesbrough en route, before going out to Preston North End. In 1891, the football club split away from the cricket club, a move that was condemned by Francis Webb, chief engineer of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) Crewe works, who was against professionalism in sport.\n\nFormation and Early Years\n-------------------------\n\nCrewe Alexandra Football Club was formed in 1877 as an offshoot of Crewe Alexandra Cricket Club. The first match was played against a side from Basford in North Staffordshire on 1 December 1877, drawing 1–1. In 1883, Crewe Alexandra's first match in the FA Cup was against Scottish club Queen's Park of Glasgow, losing 10–0.

In 1891, the football club split away from the cricket club, a move that was condemned by Francis Webb, chief engineer of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) Crewe works, who was against professionalism in sport.\n\nPost-World War II\n-----------------\n\nFrom the 1950s to the early 1980s, Crewe enjoyed only occasional success. Looking over Gresty Road, Michael Palin, in the 1980 BBC Great Railway Journeys of the World series, described Crewe as \"like those other railway towns, Swindon and Doncaster, possessed of a football team which is perpetually propping up the bottom of the Fourth Division.\" Between 1894 and 1982, Crewe finished last in the Football League eight times, more than any other league club. On 25 December 1954, Crewe embarked on a sequence where they did not win away from home for 56 matches; the run ended with a 1–0 win at Southport on 24 April 1957. Crewe finished bottom of Division Three North three times in a row from 1955–56 to 1957–58, tallying just 28, 21, and 23 points from 46 games in each respective season. The club was placed into the newly formed Fourth Division in 1958–59.\n\n1960s Promotions and Relegations\n-------------------------------\n\nIn 1963, Crewe secured their first promotion to the Third Division, winning the season's final game against Exeter City, with Frank Lord scoring the only goal in front of a crowd of 9,807 at Gresty Road. Lord holds the record for most hat-tricks for the club with eight. The club finished in third place, behind champions Brentford and Oldham Athletic, but were relegated back to Division Four the following season. In the 1964–65 season, Terry Harkin scored a record 34 league goals for Crewe. Managed by Ernie Tagg, the club achieved promotion for a second time in 1967–68, but again spent just one season in the Third Division.\n\n1970s and Early 1980s\n----------------------\n\nFrom 1969, Crewe spent 20 years in Division Four, finishing bottom in 1971–72, 1978–79, and 1981–82, and not achieving a top half finish until 1985. In 1974, they came within two minutes of taking Aston Villa into extra time in a League Cup third-round replay at Villa Park. In 1977, Tommy Lowry played his record-setting 475th and last game for the Railwaymen; he had earlier passed Peter Leigh's total of 430 appearances between 1960 and 1972. From February to September 1979, the club went a record 16 matches (15 league, one League Cup tie) without winning at Gresty Road. In December 1979, manager Tony Waddington signed the goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar, who kept eight clean-sheets in his 24 matches played, and scored a penalty – his only professional goal – to seal a 2–0 victory over York City on 5 May 1980.\n\nGradi Years (1983–2011)\n----------------------\n\nIn June 1983, after Crewe finished second from bottom at the end of the 1982–83 season, the club chairman Norman Rowlinson appointed Milan-born Dario Gradi as manager. Gradi looked to build an academy structure to develop players that could be sold to help fund the player development programme. Among his early transfer successes were Geoff Thomas and John Pemberton (both signed from Rochdale and sold to Crystal Palace, in 1987 and 1988 respectively), and David Platt, signed in 1985 and sold to Aston Villa for £200,000 in February 1988.\n\nSecond Tier Survival\n-------------------\n\nCrewe achieved their highest finishing position, 11th, in the 1997–98 First Division season. Gradi kept his team in the division until 2002, despite a matchday income on which many more lowly clubs could not survive. Boosting the finances, notable player sales included Lennon (to Leicester City for £750,000), Danny Murphy (to Liverpool for an initial fee of £1.5m), and Seth Johnson (to Derby County for £3m). Gradi celebrated his 1,000th game in charge of Crewe on 20 November 2001.\n\nStepping Back\n-------------\n\nBy the summer of 2007, Gradi was the longest-serving manager in English league football, having completed 24 years in sole charge of the club. Crewe announced that, from 1 July 2007, Gradi would take up a new role as the club's technical director while gradually allowing newly appointed first-team coach Steve Holland control of the team. Holland's first season was a disappointment as the club narrowly avoided relegation, finishing 20th with 50 points. Ahead of his second season, he spent half a million pounds on new signings, while striker Nicky Maynard joined Bristol City for £2.25 million. However, despite a positive pre-season, Crewe took only nine points from their first 16 games. The board sacked Holland as first-team coach in November 2008, and re-appointed Gradi as caretaker manager.\n\n2011 to Present Day\n-------------------\n\nSteve Davis was appointed manager in the same month. Previously manager of nearby Nantwich Town, Davis had been appointed assistant manager in June 2009, replacing former assistant Neil Baker. Davis immediately led the team to a 16-match unbeaten run in early 2012 up to 7th position, earning the club a play-off place. Crewe defeated Southend United in the two-legged semi-final, extending the unbeaten run to a club record 18 matches, and securing a play-off final against Cheltenham Town at Wembley on 27 May 2012, which they won 2–0; the goalscorers were academy graduates Nick Powell and Byron Moore.\n\nStadiums\n---------\n\nUntil 1896, Crewe played at the Alexandra Recreation Ground, located just to the north of the modern-day Gresty Road. After playing at various venues in 1896 and 1897, including in nearby Sandbach, the club returned to the same area of Crewe, adjacent to Crewe railway station, to play at the first Gresty Road ground, located to the south-east of the original stadium. In 1906, the ground was demolished to make way for some new railway lines, and a new Gresty Road stadium was built on a site directly to the west.\n\nClub Identity\n--------------\n\nSince the late 1890s, the main (home) Crewe playing strip has featured a red or predominantly red top, usually with white shorts (though red and black shorts have also been briefly adopted) and red socks. The team played in white shirts and blue shorts from 1886 to 1896, but have since played mainly in red and white. The red shirts earned the early nickname of the \"Robins\", though the club is more commonly referred to as the \"Alex\" or the \"Railwaymen\" (reflecting the club's railway works founders, the town's associations with the railway industry, and the club's proximity to Crewe railway station).\n\nSupporters and Rivalries\n------------------------\n\nCrewe is the third-largest town in Cheshire, with a built-up area population of 76,437 in 2021. Founded by employees of the railway works, the club drew many of its supporters from the works, as well as residents from more rural areas surrounding the town. The club's location next to Crewe railway station has also helped supporters travel to and from games at Gresty Road. From the 1920s through to the 1960s, attendances typically averaged around 6,000, but local derbies could more than double crowds: the visit of Stoke City on 26 October 1926 attracted 15,102, for example, while Port Vale drew 17,883 on 21 September 1953. Crewe's record league crowd was 17,883. Cup matches against major clubs such as Spurs also drew large crowds, with a record 20,000 watching a Spurs game in 1960. However, league attendances dwindled in the 1970s and 1980s, with seasonal averages of under 2,000 recorded four times, including 1,817 in 1986–87. Just 1,009 watched a 1–1 draw with Peterborough United on 4 February 1986. Crewe's resurgence from the mid-1980s under Gradi boosted local interest, with 5,000-plus attendances increasingly common, even as Gresty Road's transition to an all-seater stadium began to restrict numbers in the late 1990s. Average attendance peaked at 7,741 in 2004 during Crewe's years in the Championship. League Two crowds before the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown in 2020 averaged 4,580, just above their all-time average of 4,576.\n\nRivalries\n---------\n\nCrewe's main rivals are fellow English Football League team Port Vale. As of June 2023, the clubs have played 81 games since 1892 (8 games against Burslem Port Vale); overall, Crewe have won 20 games, Port Vale have won 38, with the teams drawing 23 games. The rivalry (known by some since the 1980s as the A500 Derby) intensified after the millennium, when both clubs were in Leagues One and Two, with close encounters sometimes resulting in violence and arrests. On 22 February 2014, Crewe beat Vale 3–1 at Vale Park, with trouble before, during, and after the game, and several arrests made, including for flares being thrown on the pitch. In January 2015 at Vale Park, Crewe won 1–0 to seal their first league double over Port Vale, with two arrests made at the game, and minor disturbances between rival fans after the match. Six arrests were made at Gresty Road during the 22 September 2018 meeting between the two sides. A 2019 study ranked the Port Vale-Crewe Alexandra rivalry as the 14th biggest rivalry in English professional football.\n\nSongs and Music\n----------------\n\nCrewe's fans were the first to sing the song \"Blue Moon\", also sung by fans of Manchester City, (with lyrics that do not quite match the Rodgers and Hart original) and said to be a response to the gloomy days of the 1950s and 1960s, or reflecting an old joke that the team only wins 'once in a blue moon', i.e., rarely. During the 1990s, one Crewe supporter, classically trained musician Richard Sutton, was known for taking a trumpet to games, playing occasional fanfares such as the theme from Star Wars during matches. The Crewe-based dance trio Dario G were named after Dario Gradi.\n\nRailwaymen Supporters Society\n------------------------------\n\nCrewe supporters often sing a song featuring the line \"We are the Railwaymen\". Aggregating and formalising several former Crewe supporters groups, and supported by the national Football Supporters' Association, the independent Railwaymen Supporters Society was established in 2018, and incorporated as a community benefit society on 8 July 2019. Initiatives have included a campaign, Project250, to raise £250,000 to invest in club shares and gain representation on the club's board (achieved in February 2020), and the establishment of an Ex-Players Association (Gareth Whalley is its president).\n\nReputation\n------------\n\nAs an early professional club in the late 19th century, several Crewe players achieved international selection, particularly for Wales. During the 20th century, however, Crewe had few stars. Welsh international Fred Keenor played his final league games for the club and his last international cap in 1932 was Crewe's first of the century. Some players started or developed their careers at Crewe before achieving fame elsewhere. For example, forward Frank Blunstone played 48 League games for Crewe in the early 1950s before a move to Chelsea and five England caps. Stan Bowles scored 18 Crewe goals in 51 games in the early 1970s and went on to play for Queens Park Rangers and England. Goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar played 24 Crewe matches at the start of the 1980s before moving to Liverpool.\n\nSexual Abuse Scandal\n----------------------\n\nOn 16 November 2016, former Crewe defender Andy Woodward revealed that he had been the victim of child sexual abuse by former football coach Barry Bennell at the club in the 1980s. By the time club chairman John Bowler responded to the revelations, on Monday 21 November, six other individuals had contacted the police, with Woodward's Crewe teammate Steve Walters alleging he was another of Bennell's victims. Woodward criticised Crewe for failing to apologise. On 27 November 2016, a third former Crewe player, Anthony Hughes, revealed that he too had been abused by Bennell, as did Crewe trainee, later Wimbledon and Northern Ireland international Mark Williams.\n\nRecords\n---------\n\nCrewe's biggest league victory came against Rotherham United on 1 October 1932 in the Third Division North when they won 8–0. In the FA Cup, their biggest win was 9–1 over Northwich Victoria on 16 November 1889. The club's heaviest defeat was in the FA Cup in 1960 when they were beaten 13–2 by Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on 30 January 1960, a game watched by 64,365: the largest crowd for a match involving Crewe.\n\nFull International Players\n---------------------------\n\nWilliam Bell was the first Crewe player to win an international cap, playing for Wales against Ireland in Wrexham in February 1886. On 15 March 1890, three Crewe players – Alfred Davies (also Wales captain), Dick Jones, and Billy Lewis – played in Wales's 3–1 defeat by England in Wrexham; Lewis scored Wales's goal, the first international goal scored by a Crewe player. John 'Jackie' Pearson became the most recent Crewe player to win an international cap for England, playing against Ireland in Belfast on 5 March 1892. He remains the only Crewe player capped for England while playing at the club. Donervon Daniels was the most recent Crewe player to win a full international cap; he played for Montserrat in their FIFA World Cup 2022 qualifier against the US Virgin Islands on 2 June 2021.\n\nManagement\n------------\n\nSince 1892, 29 men have managed Crewe. Dario Gradi holds the record for the most games: 1,359 first-team games. Two Crewe managers have been inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame: Gradi in 2004 and Harry Catterick, posthumously, in 2010.\n\nManagerial History\n--------------------\n\nSince 1892, 29 men have managed Crewe.

[154] just 1,009 watched a 1–1 draw with Peterborough United on 4 February 1986 [158] Crewe's resurgence from the mid-1980s under Gradi boosted local interest, with 5,000-plus attendances increasingly common, even as Gresty Road's transition to an all-seater stadium began to restrict numbers in the late 1990s; average attendance peaked at 7,741 in 2004 during Crewe's years in the Championship [154] League Two crowds before the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown in 2020 averaged 4,580, [154] just above their all-time average, 4,576 [159]\n\n\nAttendances\nCrewe is the third largest town in Cheshire: its built-up area had a total population of 76,437 in 2021 [153] Founded by employees of the railway works, the club drew many of its supporters from the works, as well as residents from more rural areas surrounding the town The club's location next to Crewe railway station has also helped supporters travel to and from games at Gresty Road From the 1920s through to the 1960s, attendances typically averaged around 6,000, [154] but local derbies could more than double crowds: the visit of Stoke City on 26 October 1926 attracted 15,102, for example, [155] while Port Vale drew 17,883 on 21 September 1953, [156] Crewe's record league crowd [154] Cup matches against major clubs such as Spurs also drew large crowds (a record 20,000 in 1960) [34] However, league attendances dwindled in the 1970s and 1980s, [157] when seasonal averages of under 2,000 were recorded four times, with 1986-87 being lowest: 1,817; [154] just 1,009 watched a 1–1 draw with Peterborough United on 4 February 1986

4,580, [154] just above their all-time average, 4,576 [159]\n\n\nRivalries\nCrewe's main rivals are fellow English Football League team Port Vale As of June 2023, the clubs have played 81 games since 1892 (8 games against Burslem Port Vale); overall, Crewe have won 20 games, Port Vale have won 38, with the teams drawing 23 games [162] [163] The rivalry (known by some since the 1980s as the A500 Derby) intensified after the millennium, when both clubs were in Leagues One and Two, with close encounters sometimes resulting in violence and arrests [164] [165] On 22 February 2014, Crewe beat Vale 3–1, at Vale Park and there was trouble before, during and after the game, with several arrests made and flares thrown on the pitch [166] In January 2015 at Vale Park, Crewe won 1–0 to seal their first league double over Port Vale, and two arrests were made at the game, with minor disturbances between rival fans after the match [167] Six arrests were made at Gresty Road during the 22 September 2018 meeting between the two sides [168] A 2019 study ranked the Port Vale-Crewe Alexandra rivalry as the 14th biggest rivalry in English professional football [169]\n\n\nSongs and music\nCrewe's fans were the first to sing the song \"Blue Moon\" [172]―also sung by fans of Manchester City―(with lyrics that do not quite match the Rodgers and Hart original) and said to be a response to the gloomy days of the 1950s and 1960s, [173] or reflecting an old joke that the team only wins 'once in a blue moon', i.e., rarely [174] During the 1990s, one Crewe supporter, classically trained musician Richard Sutton, was known for taking a trumpet to games, [175] playing occasional fanfares such as the theme from Star Wars during matches [176] The Crewe-based dance trio Dario G were named after Dario Gradi [177] [178]\n\n\nRailwaymen Supporters Society\nCrewe supporters often sing a song featuring the line \"We are the Railwaymen\" Aggregating and formalising several former Crewe supporters groups, and supported by the national Football Supporters' Association, the independent Railwaymen Supporters Society was established in 2018, and incorporated as a community benefit society on 8 July 2019 [179] [180] Initiatives have included a campaign, Project250, to raise £250,000 to invest in club shares and gain representation on the club's board (achieved in February 2020), [181] and the establishment of an Ex-Players Association (Gareth Whalley is its president) [182]\n\n\nReputation\nAs an early professional club in the late 19th century, several Crewe players achieved international selection, particularly for Wales During the 20th century, however, Crewe had few stars Welsh international Fred Keenor played his final league games for the club and his last international cap in 1932 was Crewe's first of the century [24] Some players started or developed their careers at Crewe before achieving fame elsewhere For example, forward Frank Blunstone played 48 League games for Crewe in the early 1950s before a move to Chelsea and five England caps, [183] Stan Bowles scored 18 Crewe goals in 51 games in the early 1970s and went on to play for Queens Park Rangers and England, [184] and goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar played 24 Crewe matches at the start of the 1980s before moving to Liverpool [45]\n\n\nPlayer development\nAs an early professional club in the late 19th century,

November 2016, former Crewe defender Andy Woodward revealed that he had been the victim of child sexual abuse by former football coach Barry Bennell (convicted as a paedophile in the US in 1994) at the club in the 1980s [193] [194] By the time club chairman John Bowler responded to the revelations, on Monday 21 November, six other individuals had contacted the police, [195] with Woodward's Crewe teammate Steve Walters alleging he was another of Bennell's victims [196] Woodward criticised Crewe for failing to apologise [197] On 27 November 2016, a third former Crewe player, Anthony Hughes, revealed that he too had been abused by Bennell, [198] as did Crewe trainee, later Wimbledon and Northern Ireland international Mark Williams [199] [200]\n\n\nRecords\nCrewe's biggest league victory came against Rotherham United on 1 October 1932 in the Third Division North when they won 8–0 [226] In the FA Cup, their biggest win was 9–1 over Northwich Victoria on 16 November 1889 [227] The club's heaviest defeat was in the FA Cup in 1960 when they were beaten 13–2 by Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on 30 January 1960, [25] a game watched by 64,365: the largest crowd for a match involving Crewe [228] In the league, Crewe's worst performance saw them beaten 11–1 at Lincoln City on 29 September 1951 in the Third Division North [229]\n\n\nPlayers\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nCurrent squad\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nFormer players\nIn 2004 the BBC's Football Focus asked fans of all professional football clubs in England and Scotland to vote for their cult hero For Crewe, Seth Johnson won with 59% of the vote; Danny Murphy came second with 33%, and Craig Hignett third with 8% [237]\n\n\nFull international players\nWilliam Bell was the first Crewe player to win an international cap, playing for Wales against Ireland in Wrexham in February 1886 [10] On 15 March 1890, three Crewe players – Alfred Davies (also Wales captain), Dick Jones and Billy Lewis – played in Wales's 3–1 defeat by England in Wrexham; [238] Lewis scored Wales's goal, [239] the first international goal scored by a Crewe player John 'Jackie' Pearson became the first Crewe player to win an international cap for England, playing against Ireland in Belfast on 5 March 1892 [15] [16] He remains the only Crewe player capped for England while playing at the club [17] Donervon Daniels was the most recent Crewe player to win a full international cap; he played for Montserrat in their FIFA World Cup 2022 qualifier against US Virgin Islands on 2 June 2021 [240]\n\n\nManagement\nSince 1892, 29 men have managed Crewe Dario Gradi holds the record for the most games: 1,359 first team games [258] Two Crewe managers have been inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame: Gradi in 2004 [259] and Harry Catterick, posthumously, in 2010 [260]\n\n\nManagerial history\nSince 1892, 29 men have managed Crewe Dario Gradi holds the record for the most games: 1,359 first team games [258] Two Crewe

{"title": "Shock_G", "content": "\nEarly life\nGregory Edward Jacobs was born on August 25, 1963, in Queens, New York [2] [3] [4] His maternal grandfather was a Hasidic Jew [5] He spent most of his childhood moving around the East Coast with his family, eventually settling in Tampa, Florida As a drummer he won the 1978 \"Most Talented\" trophy at Greco Junior High School As a result of his parents' divorce, he later relocated back to New York City There he traded his drums in for a set of turntables upon discovering and marvelling over hip hop music while the art form was still in an underground developmental stage He was mentored in the craft by his cousin Rene Negron (also known as DJ-Stretch), and their close friend Shawn Trone (also known as MC Shah-T of the parody-rap group No Face) who suggested Greg use the name \"Shah-G\" Jacobs liked the idea, but mistakenly thought his friend said Shock G, and began using that name instead [citation needed]\n\n\nCareer\nAfter relocating to Oakland, California, Shock G formed Digital Underground along with Chopmaster J, and Kenneth Waters (also known as Kenny-K) After around 15 months of unsuccessful negotiations with various small record companies, in 1988 the trio released a 12-inch single on Macola Records It featured \"Your Life's a Cartoon\" as the A-side and \"Underwater Rimes\" as the B-side Both songs were penned, produced, and performed by Jacobs, who sketched the cartoonish cover illustrations The record included the logo for Digital Underground's startup label, TNT, as well as Macola's logo TNT was founded by Tupac Shakur's management CEO Atron Gregory In 1989, the group signed with Tommy Boy Records and released \"Doowutchyalike\", receiving minimal radio airplay but became an underground hit Its video was more successful, reaching number 40 on the MTV's top 100 videos of the year \"Doowutchyalike\" paved the way for Digital Underground's debut album Sex Packets and the highest-charting song of their career \"The Humpty Dance\" both released in early 1990, and both achieving platinum sales certifications by the RIAA [8] The latter was rapped by Humpty Hump, the most flamboyant of Shock G's several alter egos By that time, Digital Underground had expanded significantly, with DJ Fuze, Money-B, and Schmoovy-Schmoov joining the group, and with Ramone \"Pee Wee\" Gooden and Tupac Shakur joining by 1991 [9]\n\n\nDigital Underground\nAfter relocating to Oakland, California, Shock G formed Digital Underground along with Chopmaster J, and Kenneth Waters (also known as Kenny-K)

resulting in characters that were maintained with such reality that they were believed to be separate people by both fans and industry insiders [10] While he rapped in his normal voice as Shock G, as \"Humpty Hump\" he adopted a more nasal sound as part of this character's exaggerated buffoon persona that included garish clothes and Groucho glasses A fictional biography was included in Digital Underground's press kit stating that Humpty Hump's real name was Edward Ellington Humphrey III and he wore the Groucho glasses after burning his nose in a deep fryer accident [11] Jacobs made public appearances as one person or the other, but at live shows and video shoots he would use a stand-in or camera tricks to maintain the illusion [12] Jacobs sometimes performed as other characters including MC Blowfish, Icey-Mike, The Computer Woman, ButtaFly, and Peanut Hakeem [citation needed]\n\n\nTelevision and film work\nShock G's TV appearances include Showtime at the Apollo in 1992, several The Arsenio Hall Show performances between 1990 and 1994, and several live MTV performances, including MTV Spring Break 1990 in Daytona Beach, Yo MTV Raps (performing live with Ed Lover and Doctor Dré) in 1991, Club MTV Live (with Downtown Julie Brown) in 1992, and MTV Jams in 1994 Most of these consisted of music performances with either Digital Underground or 2Pac; however, on an episode of the 1991 sitcom Drexell's Class, Jacobs played a small acting role as a furnace repairman Within the show's story, the title character, Otis Drexell, insists that the furnace repairman looks exactly like Humpty Hump, but neither he nor his coworker (Jason Priestley) have heard of any such hip-hop artist, especially not one with such a ridiculous name The episode ends with a live performance of Digital Underground's \"No Nose Job\" on a cruise ship full of Sports Illustrated swimsuit models, which is presented as a scene from one of Drexell's dreams [13]\n\n\nAlbums\nIn addition to his work with Digital Underground, Shock G found moderate success as a solo artist and music producer In 1993, Shock G produced Tupac Shakur's breakthrough platinum single \"I Get Around\" as well as guest starred on the single and music video, and went on to produce Tupac's \"So Many Tears\" from his multi-platinum 1995 album Me Against the World Tupac's first published work was while

He was born in 1912 in Florence, Italy, to Aida Calvelli and Guccio Gucci, the founder of the Gucci brand.\n\n**Biography**\n\nRodolfo Gucci was born in 1912 in Florence, Italy, to Aida Calvelli and Guccio Gucci, the founder of the Gucci fashion house. He was one of five sons and one daughter, and his family's business was already well-established at the time of his birth. Growing up, Rodolfo was exposed to the world of fashion and luxury, which would eventually become his career.\n\nRodolfo's early life was marked by his family's business ventures. His father, Guccio Gucci, was a successful leather goods manufacturer, and Rodolfo often accompanied him to work. This exposure to the business world would shape Rodolfo's future and influence his decisions as he grew older.\n\nAs the eldest son, Rodolfo was expected to take on a leadership role within the family business. However, he initially pursued a different path, leaving the family business to explore other opportunities. Rodolfo's decision to leave the family business was likely influenced by his desire for independence and a chance to explore the world beyond Florence.\n\n**Member of the Gucci Family**\n\nRodolfo Gucci was a member of the Gucci family, known for their influential fashion house. He was one of the five sons of Guccio Gucci, the founder of the Gucci brand. In January 1953, Rodolfo returned to the family business after the death of his father. This marked a significant shift in the family's dynamics, as Rodolfo and his brothers Aldo and Vasco took on more responsibility within the company.\n\nIn 1952, Rodolfo and his brothers traveled to New York City, where they opened the first Gucci store outside of Italy. This was a significant milestone for the company, marking the beginning of Gucci's international expansion. The store's success was largely due to Rodolfo's business acumen and his ability to adapt to the American market.\n\nRodolfo's contributions to the family business extended beyond his role as a manager. He was also a creative force within the company, designing and developing new products. In 1967, he created the Gucci Flora scarf for Grace Kelly, which became an iconic design and a staple of the Gucci brand.\n\n**Death and Legacy**\n\nRodolfo Gucci died in 1983 in Milan. His death marked the end of an era for the Gucci family, as his son Maurizio Gucci inherited his majority stake in the company. Maurizio's leadership was marked by controversy and struggle, as he faced opposition from his uncle Aldo Gucci.\n\nAfter a nearly six-year legal battle for control over Gucci, Maurizio Gucci was made chairman of the Gucci group in 1989. However, his tenure was marked by financial struggles and creative stagnation. By 1993, the company was in dire economic and creative straits, and Maurizio was forced to resign.\n\nIn 1995, Maurizio Gucci was gunned down by a hired hit man. The circumstances surrounding his death were shrouded in mystery, but it was later revealed that his ex-wife Patrizia Reggiani was involved in the plot. In 1998, Reggiani was convicted of arranging the killing.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nRodolfo Gucci has been portrayed in film and popular culture. In the 2021 film House of Gucci, he is played by English actor Jeremy Irons. The film tells the story of the Gucci family's rise and fall, with Rodolfo as a key character.\n\nThe film's portrayal of Rodolfo Gucci is a dramatization of his life and career. While it takes creative liberties with the facts, it captures the essence of his character and his role within the Gucci family.\n\n**Selected Filmography**\n\n* House of Gucci (2021) - played by Jeremy Irons\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Rodolfo Gucci.\" Wikipedia, 2023.\n* \"Gucci Family.\" Encyclopedia Britannica, 2023.\n* \"House of Gucci.\" IMDb, 2023.\n\n**Further Reading**\n\n* \"The Gucci Family: A History of Luxury and Scandal.\" Vogue, 2023.\n* \"Rodolfo Gucci: The Man Behind the Gucci Brand.\" Forbes, 2023.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Gucci Official Website\n* House of Gucci Official Website\n* Rodolfo Gucci on IMDb", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Rodolfo_Gucci\" following this outline:\n\n\nBiography\nRodolfo Gucci was born in 1912 in Florence, Italy to Aida Calvelli and Guccio Gucci [1] He was one of five sons and one daughter.\n\n\nMember of the Gucci Family\nHe was one of the five sons of Guccio Gucci, founder of the eponymous fashion house In January 1953, D'Ancora left acting and returned to the family business after the death of his father [4] In 1952, Rodolfo and his brothers Aldo and Vasco traveled to New York City [1] They opened the first Gucci store outside of Italy in New York City, only two weeks before their father's death [1] In 1967, he created the Gucci Flora scarf for Grace Kelly [4]\n\n\nDeath and legacy\nRodolfo Gucci died in 1983 in Milan [6] After his death, his son Maurizio Gucci inherited his majority stake in the company and became the majority shareholder After a nearly six-year legal battle for control over Gucci against Aldo Gucci, in 1989 Maurizio Gucci was made chairman of the Gucci group [7] Maurizio did not have a background in business, and by 1993 the business was in dire economic and creative straits [5] That year Maurizio Gucci resigned and sold his remaining interest to Investcorp, ending the Gucci family's association with the company [5] In 1995, Maurizio Gucci was gunned down by a hired hit man In 1998, his ex-wife Patrizia Reggiani was convicted of arranging the killing [8]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nIn the film House of Gucci (2021), Rodolfo Gucci is played by English actor Jeremy Irons [9]\n\n\nSelected filmography\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Neon_Genesis_Evangelion", "content": "\nPlot\nIn 2015, 15 years after a global cataclysm called the Second Impact, teenager Shinji Ikari is summoned to the futuristic city of Tokyo-3 by his estranged father Gendo Ikari, who is the director of the special paramilitary force Nerv Shinji witnesses United Nations forces battling an Angel named Sachiel, one of a race of monstrous beings whose awakening was foretold in the Dead Sea Scrolls Because of the Angels' near-impenetrable force fields, Nerv's Evangelion bio-machines, which are synchronized to their pilots' nervous systems and possess their own force fields, are the only weapons capable of fighting the Angels Nerv officer Misato Katsuragi escorts Shinji into the Nerv complex beneath Tokyo-3, where Gendo pressures him into piloting Evangelion Unit-01 against the Angel Without training, Shinji is quickly overwhelmed, causing the Evangelion to go berserk and savagely kill the Angel on its own.\n\n\nCharacters\nHideaki Anno attempted to create characters that reflected parts of his own personality [10] The characters of Evangelion struggle with their interpersonal relationships, their personal problems, [11] and traumatic events in their past [12] [13] The human qualities of the characters have enabled some viewers of the show to identify with the characters on a personal level, while others interpret them as historical, religious, or philosophical symbols [14]\n\n\nProduction\nDirector Hideaki Anno fell into a depression following the completion of work on Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water [23] and the 1992 failure of the Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honnêamise sequel project, Uru in Blue [24] According to Yasuhiro Takeda, after the failure of Uru in Blue Anno agreed to a collaboration between King Records and Gainax while drinking with King representative Toshimichi Ōtsuki; [25] King Records guaranteed Anno a time slot for \"something, anything\" [26] Anno began the development of the new series in 1993 around the notion of not running away, which had been the underlying theme of Uru in Blue, which focused on a protagonist accustomed to avoiding personal responsibility who finds himself trying to save the heroine of the story [27] Early into the production, he stated his intent to have Evangelion increase the number of anime fans, named otaku in Japanese, and attract interest in the anime medium [28] bringing a breath of fresh air to the mecha genre In the early design phase of the Evangelion project, several formats were considered, including a film, a television series and an original video animation (OVA) series The producers finally opted for the television series, as it was the most widely accessible media in Japan at that time [17] Anno also originally proposed the title Alcion for the new series, but this was rejected due to its lack of hard consonant sounds [17] He conceived the series as a metaphor of his four-year depression, as he tried to put his whole self into the work and imprint his own feelings on the film [15] [29]\n\n\nThemes\nReferences to mystical traditions in Judaism and Christianity, including Midrashic literature and Kabbalah, are threaded liberally through the series [60] Complicating viewers' attempts to form an unambiguous interpretation, [61] the series reworks Midrash stories, Zohar images and other Kabbalistic ideas developed from the Book of Genesis [62] to create a new Evangelion-specific mythology [61] The plot also combines elements of esotericism and mysticism of the Jewish Kabbalah, [63] [64] including the Angels, which have common and individual features with the Angels of the religious tradition, [65] such as Sachiel, Sandalphon and Ramiel [66] [67] Assistant director Kazuya Tsurumaki stated the religious visual references were intended to make the series more \"interesting\" and \"exotic\" for a Japanese audience, [68] denying the existence of a religious meaning for the use of Christian visual symbols in the show [69] According to Anno, \"as the symbols are mixed together, for the first time something like an interrelationship or a meaning emerges\" [70]\n\n\nRelated media\nIn May 1996, Gainax announced an Evangelion film [91] in response to fan dissatisfaction with the series finale On March 15, 1997, Gainax released Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death & Rebirth, consisting of 60 minutes of clips taken from the first 24 episodes of the series and the first 30 minutes of the new ending due to production issues [92] The second film, The End of Evangelion, which premiered on July 19, 1997, provided the complete new ending as a retelling of the final two episodes of the television series Rather than depicting the series' climax within the characters' minds, the film provides a more conventional, action-based resolution to the series' plot lines The film won numerous awards [93] [94] and grossed ¥1.45 billion within six months of its release [95] Ex.org ranked the film in 1999 as the fifth best 'All-Time Show', with the television series at the second [96] In 2009, CUT magazine ranked it the third greatest anime film of all time [97] In July 1998, the films were re-released as Revival of Evangelion which combined Death(true)² (the director's cut of Death) with The End of Evangelion.\n\n\nFilms\nIn May 1996, Gainax announced an Evangelion film [91] in response

Death(true)² (the director's cut of Death) with The End of Evangelion.\n\n\nManga and books\nTen months prior to the television broadcast of Evangelion, the character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto illustrated a manga version of the story, initially a supplement meant to promote the anime series [101] The first installment of the manga was published in the February issue of Shōnen Ace in December 1994 with subsequent installments produced on an irregular basis over an eighteen-year period The final installment was published in June 2013 [102] [103] Several publishers were initially concerned at the selection of Sadamoto to develop the manga adaptation, viewing him as \"too passé to be bankable\" [104] The first ten volumes sold over 15 million copies, [105] and the eleventh volume reached number one on the Tohan charts, [106] selling an additional two million copies [107] The manga series won the 1996 Comicker fan manga poll [108] The story has been adapted into several other manga series in addition to the original Sadamoto project, including Campus Apocalypse, a mystery story that omits the Evangelion units, and Petit Eva: Evangelion@School, a parody series which received its own original net animation serial show.\n\n\nSoundtracks and music\nShirō Sagisu composed most of the original music for the series The soundtracks released to high rankings on the Oricon charts, with Neon Genesis Evangelion III reaching the number one slot for highest sales in 1997; [109] that same year, Sagisu received the Kobe Animation award for \"Best Music Score\" for his work on Evangelion [110] Classical music by Ludwig van Beethoven, [55] Johann Sebastian Bach, Giuseppe Verdi and George Frideric Handel [71] were also featured throughout the series and the movies.\n\n\nVideo games\nSeveral video games based on the series have been developed, ranging from RPG and adventure games to mahjong and card games The series has also spawned visual novels, two of which inspired the romance and comedy-focused manga series Angelic Days and Shinji Ikari Raising Project.\n\n\nReleases\nThe original home video releases in Japan included VHS and Laserdisc sets using a release structured around \"Genesis 0:(volume number)\", with each of the first twelve releases containing two episodes each Each of the episodes received minor changes and episodes from the twenty-first to the twenty-fourth were extended with new scenes \"Genesis 0:13\" and \"Genesis 0:14\" contained the original and the alternate versions of the last two episodes first presented in Neon Genesis

from August 20, 1996, to July 7, 1998, contained two episodes each and were released using the same \"Genesis 0:(volume number)\" titling convention as the first Japanese home video release Two laserdisc collections were released as Collection 1 Deluxe Edition [126] and Collection 2 Deluxe Edition, [127] containing episodes one to four and five to eight, respectively The first DVD release by ADV Films was the eight-disk Perfect Collection in 2002, containing the original installments [128] In 2004, ADV released two DVD compilations titled Neon Genesis Evangelion: Resurrection and Neon Genesis Evangelion: Genesis Reborn, encompassing the directors' cuts of episodes from the twenty-first to the twenty-fourth, additionally including the original versions of episodes from the twenty-first to the twenty-sixth [129] [130]\n\n\nMadman Anime\nMadman has held the rights to the series since 1998 [140] in New Zealand and Australia, where Evangelion was broadcast in 1999 by the

that it had acquired the worldwide streaming rights to the original anime series, as well as Evangelion: Death (True)² and The End of Evangelion, for release in Q2 2019 [143] On March 22, 2019, Netflix announced a June 21, 2019, premiere date for the titles [144] [145] Following the dissolution of ADV Films in late 2009, [146] the Netflix release includes a re-translated script from Studio Khara's in-house translator Dan Kanemitsu [147] [148] and a new English-language cast chosen by Khara [149] The new dub received praise for the actors' performances, but the new script received some criticism for straightwashing the relationship between the characters Shinji and Kaworu [150] [151] The Netflix release omits \"Fly Me to the Moon\" in regions outside of Japan due to licensing issues [152] [153]\n\n\nAnime Limited and GKIDS\nOn May 30, 2020, British anime distributor Anime Limited announced it had acquired home video distribution rights for the original series, Evangelion: Death

and The End of Evangelion on all major digital download services six days ahead of the Standard Blu-ray release [159] This release, like the Standard BD, only contains the Netflix dub and sub.\n\n\nReception\nEven fans of the sci-fi genre who avoid anime altogether have likely heard of Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the Shell, which were each landmarks of both style and substance But arguably the greatest and certainly most thematically dense of the three '90s sci-fi anime masterpieces is Neon Genesis Evangelion It has one of the most enduring worldwide cult franchises and passionate fanbases in all of geekdom  [...] the most celebrated cast in anime   [.. and] poster boy/protagonist Shinji is one of the most nuanced, popular, and relatable characters in anime history.\n\n\nAwards\nNeon Genesis Evangelion has scored highly in popularity polls In 1996, the series won first place in the \"Best Loved Series\" category of the Anime Grand Prix, a reader-polled award series published in Animage magazine [189] The show was again awarded this prize in 1997 by a large margin [190] The End of Evangelion won first place in 1998, [191] making Neon Genesis

The series was first broadcast in Japan from October 1995 to March 1996 and has since become a cult classic and one of the most influential anime series of all time.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe story takes place in the year 2015, 15 years after a global cataclysm known as the Second Impact. The world is on the brink of destruction, and humanity's last hope lies in the form of giant humanoid robots known as Evangelions. The series follows the story of Shinji Ikari, a 14-year-old boy who is summoned to the futuristic city of Tokyo-3 by his estranged father, Gendo Ikari, who is the director of the special paramilitary force NERV. Shinji is forced to pilot the Evangelion Unit-01 against the Angels, a series of monstrous beings whose awakening was foretold in the Dead Sea Scrolls.\n\n**Characters**\n\nThe characters of Evangelion are complex and multi-dimensional, with each one struggling with their own personal problems and traumatic events in their past. Hideaki Anno attempted to create characters that reflected parts of his own personality, and the show's human qualities have enabled viewers to identify with the characters on a personal level. The series has been interpreted as having historical, religious, or philosophical symbols, and the characters' relationships with each other are a central focus of the show.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe production of Evangelion was a difficult and tumultuous process, with Hideaki Anno struggling with depression and creative differences with his producers. The series was originally intended to be a more lighthearted and humorous show, but Anno's vision for the series evolved over time to become a much darker and more complex exploration of the human condition. The show's animation style was also innovative for its time, using a combination of traditional animation techniques and computer-generated imagery to create a unique and visually striking look.\n\n**Themes**\n\nNeon Genesis Evangelion is a show that explores a wide range of themes, including existentialism, human psychology, and the nature of God. The series draws heavily on biblical and Kabbalistic symbolism, incorporating imagery and themes from both traditions into its narrative. The show also explores the consequences of playing god, and the dangers of unchecked technological advancement. The series' use of symbolism and metaphor has made it a subject of interpretation and analysis, with many viewers and critics drawing their own conclusions about the show's meaning and significance.\n\n**Related Media**\n\nEvangelion has spawned a wide range of related media, including films, manga, video games, and soundtracks. The series' success has led to the creation of several films, including Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death & Rebirth and The End of Evangelion, which provide a more conventional and action-based resolution to the series' plot lines. The show has also been adapted into several manga series, including Campus Apocalypse and Petit Eva: Evangelion@School, which offer alternative takes on the show's characters and story.\n\n**Manga and Books**\n\nThe Evangelion manga series was written and illustrated by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, who was initially concerned about being selected to develop the adaptation. However, the series went on to become a huge success, selling over 15 million copies and winning the 1996 Comicker fan manga poll. The manga series has been adapted into several other manga series, including Campus Apocalypse and Petit Eva: Evangelion@School, which offer alternative takes on the show's characters and story.\n\n**Soundtracks and Music**\n\nThe original music for Evangelion was composed by Shirō Sagisu, who received the Kobe Animation award for \"Best Music Score\" for his work on the show. The soundtracks were released to high rankings on the Oricon charts, with Neon Genesis Evangelion III reaching the number one slot for highest sales in 1997. The show's use of classical music by composers such as Beethoven, Bach, and Verdi adds to its sense of drama and emotion.\n\n**Video Games**\n\nSeveral video games based on Evangelion have been developed, ranging from RPG and adventure games to mahjong and card games. The series has also spawned visual novels, two of which inspired the romance and comedy-focused manga series Angelic Days and Shinji Ikari Raising Project.\n\n**Releases**\n\nThe original home video releases in Japan included VHS and Laserdisc sets using a release structured around \"Genesis 0:(volume number)\", with each of the first twelve releases containing two episodes each. The series was later released on DVD by ADV Films, which included the original installments and a re-translated script from Studio Khara's in-house translator Dan Kanemitsu.\n\n**Japan**\n\nThe original home video releases in Japan included VHS and Laserdisc sets using a release structured around \"Genesis 0:(volume number)\", with each of the first twelve releases containing two episodes each.

Madman Anime also holds the home video licenses for the Rebuild of Evangelion films.\n\n**Netflix**\n\nOn November 26, 2018, streaming company Netflix announced that it had acquired the worldwide streaming rights to the original anime series, as well as Evangelion: Death (True)² and The End of Evangelion, for release in Q2 2019.

The series has been credited with revitalizing and transforming the giant mecha genre and has ushered in the era of the \"new Japanese animation serial\", characterized by innovations that allowed a technical and artistic revival of the industry.

by his estranged father Gendo Ikari, who is the director of the special paramilitary force Nerv Shinji witnesses United Nations forces battling an Angel named Sachiel, one of a race of monstrous beings whose awakening was foretold in the Dead Sea Scrolls Because of the Angels' near-impenetrable force fields, Nerv's Evangelion bio-machines, which are synchronized to their pilots' nervous systems and possess their own force fields, are the only weapons capable of fighting the Angels Nerv officer Misato Katsuragi escorts Shinji into the Nerv complex beneath Tokyo-3, where Gendo pressures him into piloting Evangelion Unit-01 against the Angel Without training, Shinji is quickly overwhelmed, causing the Evangelion to go berserk and savagely kill the Angel on its own.\n\n\nCharacters\nHideaki Anno attempted to create characters that reflected parts of his own personality [10] The characters of Evangelion struggle with their interpersonal relationships, their personal problems, [11] and traumatic events in their past [12] [13] The human qualities of the characters have enabled some viewers of the show to identify with the characters on a personal level, while others interpret them as historical, religious, or philosophical symbols [14]\n\n\nProduction\nDirector Hideaki Anno fell into a depression following the completion of work on Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water [23] and the 1992 failure of the Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honnêamise sequel project, Uru in Blue [24] According to Yasuhiro Takeda, after the failure of Uru in Blue Anno agreed to a collaboration between King Records and Gainax while drinking with King representative Toshimichi Ōtsuki; [25] King Records guaranteed Anno a time slot for \"something, anything\" [26] Anno began the development of the new series in 1993 around the notion of not running away, which had been the underlying theme of Uru in Blue, which focused on a protagonist accustomed to avoiding personal responsibility who finds himself trying to save the heroine of the story [27] Early into the production, he stated his intent to have Evangelion increase the number of anime fans, named otaku in Japanese, and attract interest in the anime medium [28] bringing a breath of fresh air to the mecha genre In the early design phase of the Evangelion project, several formats were considered, including a film, a television series and an original video animation (OVA) series The producers finally opted for the television series, as it was the most widely accessible media in Japan at that time [17] Anno also originally proposed the title Alcion for the new series, but this was rejected due to its lack of hard consonant sounds [17] He conceived the series as a metaphor of his four-year depression, as he tried to put his whole self into the work and imprint his own feelings on the film [15] [29]\n\n\nThemes\nReferences to mystical traditions in Judaism and Christianity, including Midrashic literature and Kabbalah, are threaded liberally through the series [60] Complicating viewers' attempts to form an unambiguous interpretation, [61] the series reworks Midrash stories, Zohar images and other Kabbalistic ideas developed from the Book of Genesis [62] to create a new Evangelion-specific mythology [61] The plot also combines elements of esotericism and mysticism of the Jewish Kabbalah, [63] [64] including the Angels, which have common and individual features with the Angels of the religious tradition, [65] such as Sachiel, Sandalphon and Ramiel [66] [67] Assistant director Kazuya Tsurumaki stated the religious visual references were intended to make the series more \"interesting\" and \"exotic\" for a Japanese audience, [68] denying the existence of a religious meaning for the use of Christian visual symbols in the show [69] According to Anno, \"as the symbols are mixed together, for the first time something like an interrelationship or a meaning emerges\" [70]\n\n\nRelated media\nIn May 1996, Gainax announced an Evangelion film [91] in response to fan dissatisfaction with the series finale On March 15, 1997, Gainax released Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death & Rebirth, consisting of 60 minutes of clips taken from the first 24 episodes of the series and the first 30 minutes of the new ending due to production issues [92] The second film, The End of Evangelion, which premiered on July 19, 1997, provided the complete new ending as a retelling of the final two episodes of the television series Rather than depicting the series' climax within the characters' minds, the film provides a more conventional, action-based resolution to the series' plot lines The film won numerous awards [93] [94] and grossed ¥1.45 billion within six months of its release [95] Ex.org ranked the film in 1999 as the fifth best 'All-Time Show', with the television series at the second [96] In 2009, CUT magazine ranked it the third greatest anime film of all time [97] In July 1998, the films were re-released as Revival of Evangelion which combined Death(true)² (the director's cut of Death) with The End of Evangelion.\n\n\nFilms\nIn May 1996, Gainax announced

publishers were initially concerned at the selection of Sadamoto to develop the manga adaptation, viewing him as \"too passé to be bankable\" [104] The first ten volumes sold over 15 million copies, [105] and the eleventh volume reached number one on the Tohan charts, [106] selling an additional two million copies [107] The manga series won the 1996 Comicker fan manga poll [108] The story has

{"title": "Bubble_tea", "content": "\nDescription\nBubble teas fall under two categories: teas without milk and milk teas Both varieties come with a choice of black, green, or oolong tea as the base [1] Milk teas usually include powdered or fresh milk, but may also use condensed milk, almond milk, soy milk, or coconut milk [4]\n\n\nVariants\nBubble tea comes in many variations which usually consist of black tea, green tea, oolong tea, and sometimes white tea [2] Another variation, yuenyeung, (Chinese: 鴛鴦, named after the Mandarin duck) originated in Hong Kong and consists of black tea, coffee, and milk [1]\n\n\nDrink\nBubble tea comes in many variations which usually consist of black tea, green tea, oolong tea, and sometimes white tea [2] Another variation, yuenyeung, (Chinese: 鴛鴦, named after the Mandarin duck) originated in Hong Kong and consists of black tea, coffee, and milk [1]\n\n\nToppings\nTapioca pearls (boba) are the most common ingredient, although there are other ways to make the chewy spheres found in bubble tea [1] The pearls vary in color according to the ingredients mixed in with the tapioca Most pearls are black from brown sugar [2] [20]\n\n\nIce and sugar level\nBubble tea shops often give customers the option of choosing the amount of ice or sugar in their drink [27] Sugar and ice levels are usually specified ordinally (e.g no ice, less ice, normal ice, more ice), corresponding to quarterly intervals (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) [27]\n\n\nPackaging\nIn Southeast Asia, bubble tea is usually packaged in a plastic takeaway cup, sealed with plastic or a rounded cap New entrants into the market have attempted to distinguish their products by packaging it in bottles [28] and other shapes [29]  Some have used sealed plastic bags [30] Nevertheless, the plastic takeaway cup with a sealed cap is still the most common packaging method.\n\n\nPreparation method\nThe tea can be made in batches during the day or the night before Brewing different types of teas take different amounts of time and temperature For instance, green tea requires brewing at a lower temperature, typically between 176–185 °F (80–85 °C) with a brewing time of 8–10 minutes to extract its optimal flavor In contrast, black tea needs to be made with hotter water, usually around 203–212 °F (95–100 °C) with a brewing of around 15–20 minutes to bring out its sweetness A tea warmer dispenser allows the tea to remain heated for up to eight hours \n\n\nHistory\nMilk and sugar have been added to tea in Taiwan since the Dutch colonization of Taiwan in 1624–1662 [1]\n\n\nPopularity\nIn the 1990s, bubble tea spread all over East and Southeast Asia with its ever-growing popularity In regions like Hong Kong, Mainland China, Japan, Vietnam, [32] and Singapore, the bubble tea trend expanded rapidly among young people In some popular shops, people would line up for more than thirty minutes to get a cup of the drink [2] In recent years, the popularity of bubble tea has gone beyond the beverage itself, with boba lovers inventing various bubble tea flavored-foods, including ice cream, pizza, toast, sushi, and ramen [13]\n\n\nTaiwan\nIn Taiwan, bubble tea has become not just a beverage, but an enduring icon of the culture and food history for the nation [8] [33] In 2020, the date April 30 was officially declared as National Bubble Tea Day in Taiwan [2] That same year, the image of bubble tea was proposed as an alternative cover design for Taiwan's passport [34]  According to Al Jazeera, bubble tea has become synonymous with Taiwan and is an important symbol of Taiwanese identity both domestically and internationally [35] Bubble tea is used to represent Taiwan in the context of the Milk Tea Alliance [36] [35] 50 Lan is a bubble tea chain founded in Tainan [37]\n\n\nHong Kong\nHong Kong is famous for its traditional Hong Kong-style milk tea, which is made with brewed black tea and evaporated milk [1] While milk tea has long become integrated into people's daily life, the expansion of Taiwanese bubble tea chains, including Tiger Sugar, Youiccha, and Xing Fu Tang, into Hong Kong created a new wave for \"boba tea\" [5]\n\n\nMainland China\nSince the idea of adding tapioca pearls into milk tea was introduced into China in the 1990s, bubble tea has increased in popularity [38] In 2020 it was estimated that the

boba tea, has become a popular beverage globally, originating from Taiwan in the 1980s. This sweet and refreshing drink has gained immense popularity, especially among the younger generation. With its unique combination of tea, milk, and tapioca pearls, bubble tea has become a cultural phenomenon, transcending geographical boundaries and cultural barriers. This article provides an in-depth look at the history, variants, preparation methods, packaging, and cultural impact of bubble tea.\n\n**Description**\n\nBubble teas fall under two categories: teas without milk and milk teas. Both varieties come with a choice of black, green, or oolong tea as the base. Milk teas usually include powdered or fresh milk, but may also use condensed milk, almond milk, soy milk, or coconut milk.\n\n**Variants**\n\nBubble tea comes in many variations, which usually consist of black tea, green tea, oolong tea, and sometimes white tea. Another variation, yuenyeung (Chinese: 鴛鴦, named after the Mandarin duck), originated in Hong Kong and consists of black tea, coffee, and milk.\n\n**Drink**\n\nBubble tea comes in many variations, which usually consist of black tea, green tea, oolong tea, and sometimes white tea. Another variation, yuenyeung (Chinese: 鴛鴦, named after the Mandarin duck), originated in Hong Kong and consists of black tea, coffee, and milk.\n\n**Toppings**\n\nTapioca pearls (boba) are the most common ingredient, although there are other ways to make the chewy spheres found in bubble tea. The pearls vary in color according to the ingredients mixed in with the tapioca. Most pearls are black from brown sugar.\n\n**Ice and Sugar Level**\n\nBubble tea shops often give customers the option of choosing the amount of ice or sugar in their drink. Sugar and ice levels are usually specified ordinally (e.g no ice, less ice, normal ice, more ice), corresponding to quarterly intervals (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%).\n\n**Packaging**\n\nIn Southeast Asia, bubble tea is usually packaged in a plastic takeaway cup, sealed with plastic or a rounded cap. New entrants into the market have attempted to distinguish their products by packaging it in bottles and other shapes. Some have used sealed plastic bags. Nevertheless, the plastic takeaway cup with a sealed cap is still the most common packaging method.\n\n**Preparation Method**\n\nThe tea can be made in batches during the day or the night before. Brewing different types of teas take different amounts of time and temperature. For instance, green tea requires brewing at a lower temperature, typically between 176–185 °F (80–85 °C) with a brewing time of 8–10 minutes to extract its optimal flavor. In contrast, black tea needs to be made with hotter water, usually around 203–212 °F (95–100 °C) with a brewing of around 15–20 minutes to bring out its sweetness. A tea warmer dispenser allows the tea to remain heated for up to eight hours.\n\n**History**\n\nMilk and sugar have been added to tea in Taiwan since the Dutch colonization of Taiwan in 1624–1662. The concept of adding tapioca pearls to milk tea was introduced by Liu Han-Chieh, a Taiwanese tea shop owner, in the 1980s.\n\n**Popularity**\n\nIn the 1990s, bubble tea spread all over East and Southeast Asia with its ever-growing popularity. In regions like Hong Kong, Mainland China, Japan, Vietnam, and Singapore, the bubble tea trend expanded rapidly among young people. In some popular shops, people would line up for more than thirty minutes to get a cup of the drink.\n\n**Taiwan**\n\nIn Taiwan, bubble tea has become not just a beverage, but an enduring icon of the culture and food history for the nation. In 2020, the date April 30 was officially declared as National Bubble Tea Day in Taiwan. That same year, the image of bubble tea was proposed as an alternative cover design for Taiwan's passport.\n\n**Hong Kong**\n\nHong Kong is famous for its traditional Hong Kong-style milk tea, which is made with brewed black tea and evaporated milk. While milk tea has long become integrated into people's daily life, the expansion of Taiwanese bubble tea chains, including Tiger Sugar, Youiccha, and Xing Fu Tang, into Hong Kong created a new wave for \"boba tea\".\n\n**Mainland China**\n\nSince the idea of adding tapioca pearls into milk tea was introduced into China in the 1990s, bubble tea has increased in popularity. In 2020 it was estimated that the consumption of bubble tea was 5 times that of coffee in recent years.\n\n**Japan**\n\nBubble tea first entered Japan by the late 1990s, but it failed to leave a lasting impression on the public markets.

He is best known as the keyboardist and vocalist of the Swedish pop group ABBA, which was one of the most successful and influential bands of the 1970s. Andersson's career spans over five decades, during which he has released numerous albums, singles, and soundtracks, and has been involved in various musical projects, including stage musicals and film scores.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nGöran Bror Benny Andersson was born on December 16, 1946, in the Vasastan district of Stockholm, Sweden. His father, Gösta Andersson, was a civil engineer, and his mother, Laila, was a homemaker. Andersson's musical background comes from his father and grandfather, Efraim, who both enjoyed playing the accordion. At the age of six, Benny got his own accordion, and his father and grandfather taught him Swedish folk music, traditional music, and schlager.\n\nAndersson's early musical influences included Italian schlager singer Caterina Valente, whose song \"Du Bist Musik\" was one of his first record purchases, and Elvis Presley, whose song \"Jailhouse Rock\" he was particularly fond of. The flip side of the single, \"Treat Me Nice,\" which featured a piano, also caught his attention. This variety of different kinds of music influenced him throughout his life.\n\n**Career**\n\nIn October 1964, Andersson joined the Hep Stars, a Swedish pop band, as their keyboardist. The band made a breakthrough in March 1965 with their hit single \"Cadillac,\" which eventually became the most celebrated of the Swedish 1960s pop bands. Andersson secured his place as the band's keyboardist and musical driving force, as well as a teen idol. The band performed mostly covers of international hits, but Andersson soon started writing his own material, and gave the band the classic hits \"No Response,\" \"Sunny Girl,\" \"Wedding,\" \"Consolation,\" \"It's Nice To Be Back,\" and \"She Will Love You,\" among others.\n\n**Hep Stars (1964–1969)**\n\nDuring his time with the Hep Stars, Andersson met Björn Ulvaeus, a fellow musician and songwriter, in June 1966. The two men started writing songs together, their first being \"Isn't It Easy To Say,\" eventually recorded by the Hep Stars. Andersson also had a fruitful songwriting collaboration with Lasse Berghagen, with whom he wrote several songs and submitted \"Hej, Clown\" for the 1969 Melodifestivalen – the Swedish Eurovision Song Festival finals. The song finished in second place.\n\n**Before ABBA (1969–1972)**\n\nAround the same time, Andersson met vocalist Anni-Frid Lyngstad, and they soon became a couple. During this contest, he met vocalist Agnetha Fältskog, who was Ulvaeus's girlfriend.\n\n**ABBA (1972–1982)**\n\nThe group's breakthrough came with winning the Eurovision Song Contest for Sweden with \"Waterloo\" on April 6, 1974. During the next eight years, Andersson (together with Ulvaeus) wrote music for and produced eight studio albums with ABBA.

BAO has released five albums to huge success in Sweden, all containing hit singles.\n\n**New Compositions (1984–present)**\n\nAndersson composes primarily for his band BAO, with vocalists Sjöholm and Körberg, but he keeps his older material alive by re-visiting it, as in Mamma Mia! and the Swedish version of Chess.\n\n**Film Music**\n\nAndersson has written music to several films for screen and television, including the early 1970s Swedish erotica movie The Seduction of Inga. The film was not a success, but the 'Björn & Benny' single \"She's My Kind of Girl\" surprised the composers by being released in Japan and becoming a Top 10 hit (the song renamed in Japan as \"The Little Girl of the Cold Wind\").\n\n**Awards**\n\nTogether with Ulvaeus, Andersson was nominated for a Drama Desk Award in a category \"Outstanding Music\" (for the musical Chess), and for a Tony Award in a category \"Best Orchestrations\" (for musical Mamma Mia!).

the Special Operations Executive (SOE) during the Second World War and was an advertising executive at the time of his son's birth; and an American mother, Dorothy Scholes, of Italian and Irish descent [5] [6] [7] [8]\n\n\nCareer\nDalton quickly moved to television, working mainly with the BBC, and in 1968 made his film debut as Philip II of France in The Lion in Winter This was the first of several period dramas, which included a remake of Wuthering Heights in 1970 in which he portrayed Heathcliff, and the English Civil War drama Cromwell as Cavalier commander Prince Rupert of the Rhine After a few more films, Dalton took a break in 1971 to concentrate on the theatre, performing with the Royal Shakespeare Company and other troupes throughout the world  In 1975, Dalton and Vivien Merchant headed the cast of a revival of Noël Coward's The Vortex [12]\n\n\nJames Bond (1986–1994)\nDalton had been considered for the role of James Bond several times According to the documentary Inside The Living Daylights, the producers first approached Dalton in 1968 for On Her Majesty's Secret Service although Dalton himself in this same documentary claims the approach occurred when he was either 24 or 25 and had already done the film Mary, Queen of Scots (1971), so it has been speculated that it was more likely for Live and Let Die, the film in which Roger Moore made his debut as Bond after Sean Connery in Diamonds Are Forever Dalton declined the offer and told the producers that he was too young for the role In a 1987 interview, Dalton said, \"Originally I did not want to take over from Sean Connery He was far too good, he was wonderful I was about 24 or 25, which is too young But when you've seen Bond from the beginning, you don't take over from Sean Connery.\" [15] In either 1979 or 1980, during pre-production of For Your Eyes Only [16] he was approached again, but did not favour the direction the films were taking, nor did he think the producers were seriously looking for a new 007 [16] As he explained, his idea of Bond was different [17] In a 1979 episode of the television series Charlie's Angels, Dalton played the role of Damien Roth, a millionaire playboy described by David Doyle's character as \"almost James Bond-ian\".\n\n\nInitial offers\nDalton had been considered for the role of James Bond several times According to the documentary Inside The Living Daylights, the producers first approached Dalton in 1968 for On Her Majesty's Secret Service although Dalton himself in this same documentary claims the approach occurred when he was either

David Doyle's character as \"almost James Bond-ian\".\n\n\nFilms\nDalton's first appearance as 007, The Living Daylights (1987), was critically successful, grossing more than either of the previous two Bond films with Moore (Octopussy (1983) and A View to a Kill (1985)) as well as contemporary box-office rivals such as Die Hard and Lethal Weapon His second film, Licence to Kill (1989), although almost as successful as its predecessor in most markets, did not perform as well at the U.S box office, in large part due to a lacklustre marketing campaign, whereby the title of the film was abruptly changed from Licence Revoked The main factor for the lack of success in the U.S was that it was released at the same time as the hugely successful Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Tim Burton's Batman, and Lethal Weapon 2, during the summer blockbuster season In the United Kingdom, one of its critical markets, the film was also hampered by receiving a 15 certificate from the British Board of Film Classification, which severely affected its commercial success Future Bond films, following the resolution of legal and other issues, were all released between 31 October and mid-December, in order to avoid the risk of a summer failure, as had happened to Licence to Kill.\n\n\nDalton as Bond\nDalton portrayed Bond in The Living Daylights (1987) and Licence to Kill (1989), the fifteenth and sixteenth entries in the franchise Unlike Moore, who had played Bond as more of a light-hearted playboy, Dalton's portrayal of Bond was darker and more serious Dalton pushed for renewed emphasis on the gritty realism of Ian Fleming's novels instead of fantasy plots and humour [23]\n\n\nPost-Bond career\nAfter his Bond films, Dalton divided his work between stage, television and films, and diversified the characters he played This helped him eliminate the 007 typecasting that followed him during the previous period Dalton was nevertheless for a certain period considered for a part in the Bond film  GoldenEye Instead, he played Nazi spy Neville Sinclair in The Rocketeer (1991), and Rhett Butler in Scarlett, the television miniseries sequel to Gone with the Wind He also appeared as criminal informant Eddie Myers in the acclaimed British TV film Framed (1992) He had a major part in an episode of the TV series Tales from the Crypt.\n\n\nPersonal life\nDalton was in a relationship with reporter Kate Adie as a youth, [36] and with English actress Vanessa Redgrave (with whom he appeared in the 1971 film Mary, Queen of Scots and the 1979 film Agatha) between 1971 and 1986 [37] He briefly dated actresses Stefanie Powers [38] and Whoopi Goldberg [39]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Timothy

This experience helped him develop his skills as a stage actor and broadened his range as a performer.\n\n## James Bond (1986-1994)\n\nDalton had been considered for the role of James Bond several times before he was finally cast as the fifteenth Bond in 1986. He appeared in two Bond films, The Living Daylights (1987) and Licence to Kill (1989). Unlike his predecessor, Roger Moore, who played Bond as a light-hearted playboy, Dalton's portrayal of Bond was darker and more serious. He pushed for a renewed emphasis on the gritty realism of Ian Fleming's novels, rather than fantasy plots and humor.\n\n## Films\n\nDalton's first appearance as Bond, The Living Daylights, was critically successful, grossing more than either of the previous two Bond films with Moore. His second film, Licence to Kill, although almost as successful as its predecessor in most markets, did not perform as well at the U.S. box office due to a lackluster marketing campaign. Future Bond films were released between October and December, avoiding the risk of a summer failure.\n\n## Post-Bond Career\n\nAfter his Bond films, Dalton divided his work between stage, television, and films, and diversified the characters he played. This helped him eliminate the 007 typecasting that followed him during the previous period. Dalton was considered for a part in the Bond film GoldenEye, but instead appeared in other films, including The Rocketeer and Scarlett, a television miniseries sequel to Gone with the Wind.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nDalton was in a relationship with reporter Kate Adie as a youth and with English actress Vanessa Redgrave between 1971 and 1986. He briefly dated actresses Stefanie Powers and Whoopi Goldberg.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* The Lion in Winter (1968)\n* Wuthering Heights (1970)\n* Cromwell (1970)\n* The Vortex (1975)\n* Mary, Queen of Scots (1971)\n* Agatha (1979)\n* The Living Daylights (1987)\n* Licence to Kill (1989)\n* The Rocketeer (1991)\n* Scarlett (1994)\n* Framed (1992)\n\n**References**\n\n* Dalton, T.

following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nTimothy Leonard Dalton Leggett was born on 21 March 1946 in Colwyn Bay, Wales, to an English father, Peter Dalton Leggett, who was a captain in the Special Operations Executive (SOE) during the Second World War and was an advertising executive at the time of his son's birth; and an American mother, Dorothy Scholes, of Italian and Irish descent [5] [6] [7] [8]\n\n\nCareer\nDalton quickly moved to television, working mainly with the BBC, and in 1968 made his film debut as Philip II of France in The Lion in Winter This was the first of several period dramas, which included a remake of Wuthering Heights in 1970 in which he portrayed Heathcliff, and the English Civil War drama Cromwell as Cavalier commander Prince Rupert of the Rhine After a few more films, Dalton took a break in 1971 to concentrate on the theatre, performing with the Royal Shakespeare Company and other troupes throughout the world  In 1975, Dalton and Vivien Merchant headed the cast of a revival of Noël Coward's The Vortex [12]\n\n\nJames Bond (1986–1994)\nDalton had been considered for the role of James Bond several times According to the documentary Inside The Living Daylights, the producers first approached Dalton in 1968 for On Her Majesty's Secret Service although Dalton himself in this same documentary claims the approach occurred when he was either 24 or 25 and had already done the film Mary, Queen of Scots (1971), so it has been speculated that it was more likely for Live and Let Die, the film in which Roger Moore made his debut as Bond after Sean Connery in Diamonds Are Forever Dalton declined the offer and told the producers that he was too young for the role In a 1987 interview, Dalton said, \"Originally I did not want to take over from Sean Connery He was far too good, he was wonderful I was about 24 or 25, which is too young But when you've seen Bond from the beginning, you don't take over from Sean Connery.\" [15] In either 1979 or 1980, during pre-production of For Your Eyes Only [16] he was approached again, but did not favour the direction the films were taking, nor did he think the producers were seriously looking for a new 007 [16] As he explained, his idea of Bond was different [17] In a 1979 episode of the television series Charlie's Angels, Dalton played the role of Damien Roth, a millionaire playboy described by David Doyle's character as \"almost James Bond-ian\".\n\n\nInitial offers\nDalton had been considered for the role of James Bond several times According to the documentary Inside The Living Daylights,

with Moore (Octopussy (1983) and A View to a Kill (1985)) as well as contemporary box-office rivals such as Die Hard and Lethal Weapon His second film, Licence to Kill (1989), although almost as successful as its predecessor in most markets, did not perform as well at the U.S box office, in large part due to a lacklustre marketing campaign, whereby the title of the film was abruptly changed from Licence Revoked The main factor for the lack of success in the U.S was that it was released at the same time as the hugely successful Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Tim Burton's Batman, and Lethal Weapon 2, during the summer blockbuster season In the United Kingdom, one of its critical markets, the film was also hampered by receiving a 15 certificate from the British Board of Film Classification, which severely affected its commercial success Future Bond films, following the resolution of legal and other issues, were all released between 31 October and mid-December, in order to avoid the risk of a summer failure, as had happened to Licence to Kill.\n\n\nDalton as Bond\nDalton portrayed Bond in The Living Daylights (1987) and Licence to Kill (1989), the fifteenth and sixteenth entries in the franchise Unlike Moore, who had played Bond as more of a light-hearted playboy, Dalton's portrayal of Bond was darker and more serious Dalton pushed for renewed emphasis on

the Bond film  GoldenEye Instead, he played Nazi spy Neville Sinclair in The Rocketeer (1991), and Rhett Butler in Scarlett, the television miniseries sequel to Gone with the Wind He also appeared as criminal informant Eddie Myers in the acclaimed British TV film Framed (1992) He had a major part in an episode of the TV series Tales from the Crypt.\n\n\nPersonal life\nDalton was in a relationship with reporter Kate Adie as a youth, [36] and with English actress Vanessa Redgrave (with whom he appeared in the 1971 film Mary, Queen of Scots and the 1979 film Agatha) between 1971 and 1986 [37] He

at the law firm Pinkofskys, then at his own practice, Singh Law, which he established with Gurratan [27] [33] In a Toronto Star article published on January 9, 2012, Singh stated that his background in criminal defence contributed to his decision to enter politics, particularly his work advocating for the protection of rights entrenched in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms [17]\n\n\nEarly federal politics\nSingh provided pro bono consulting to an activist group that protested the visit to Canada of Kamal Nath, the former Indian trade minister who had allegedly led armed counter terrorist groups, against sikh-separatists, during the 1984 Delhi riots [34] [35] After failing to get their views heard, Singh was inspired to run for office by the activist group so their concerns could be better represented [34]\n\n\nProvincial politics (2011–2017)\nSingh ran in the 2011 Ontario provincial election as the NDP candidate in the overlapping provincial riding, defeating Liberal incumbent Kuldip Kular by 2,277 votes [12] [13] Singh became the first New Democrat elected to represent the Peel Region, as well as the first turban-wearing MPP [12] [36] In the 40th

shortcomings in the legislation regarding the driver's right to sue auto insurance companies Singh said, \"removing more protections for people is not the right way to go, it's a significant loss of our rights, and this is not a good bill.\" [49]\n\n\nSecond term (2014–2017)\nSingh ran for re-election in 2014 He won his riding with 43.6 per cent of the vote, beating Liberal challenger Kuldip

Burnaby South riding [83] The NDP won 24 seats, down from 44 seats at the 2015 election However, the incumbent Trudeau Liberal government failed to retain its majority, allowing the NDP to share the balance of power in Parliament [84] It was the lowest seat count for the NDP since 2004, and the party was passed by the Bloc Québécois as the third-largest parliamentary party [85] The NDP lost all but one of its seats in Quebec, where it was suggested that Singh's Sikhism may have been negatively received by voters in the context of the Quebec ban on religious symbols [86]\n\n\n43rd Canadian Parliament\nOn June 17, 2020, Singh was removed from the House of Commons for the rest of the day after he called Bloc Québécois MP Alain Therrien a \"racist\" and refused to apologize when Therrien was the sole member to prevent unanimous consent on the second motion concluding systemic racism and discrimination in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) prior to the completion of the public inquiry from Singh's first motion [87]\n\n\n2021 federal campaign\nIn the 2021 federal election campaign Singh was proud to announce that he was the only leader with a plan to enforce mandatory COVID-19 vaccination for employees that work under a collective bargaining contract [88] Singh made it a campaign promise that \"All collective agreements include a process for progressive discipline - up to and including termination Discipline should always be a last resort, but may be necessary in rare cases to protect the health and safety of Canadians.\" [89] On September 5 he returned to the subject in a press conference with the NDP candidate for the riding of Ottawa-Centre Here he laid out his promise to \" [supply] $1 billion in targeted vaccination programs,\" as well as to create \"a national vaccine passport system\", to extend pandemic supports, and to strengthen \"laws to protect health care workers and those seeking care from harassment and attacks.\" [90] He attracted support from other party leaders including Justin Trudeau and Erin O'Toole [91]\n\n\n44th Canadian Parliament\nSingh was re-elected with a comfortable majority of slightly more than 4,000 votes to serve in Burnaby-South The 44th Canadian Parliament made very few changes to its predecessor, and the NDP emerged with its total number of seats unchanged at 25 [citation needed]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nOn

consumption of psychoactive drugs for personal use as has been the case in Portugal since 2001 [20] [99]\n\n\nEconomic policy\nSingh's economic policy states that \"millions of Canadians are living in poverty\" [100] Singh supports a progressive tax system [101] and supports eliminating several tax deductions available to the highest-income earners and redirect the money to low-income seniors, workers and disabled Canadians [102] Singh's tax agenda during the 2017 New Democratic Party leadership election included creating new tax brackets for the highest-income earners and raising corporate tax [103]\n\n\nEnergy policy\nSingh favours reducing Canada's carbon emissions to 30 percent of 2005 levels by 2025 This would be done by assisting provinces with the 2030 \"coal phaseout\", implementing a zero emissions vehicle agenda, \"greening\" the tax system by adding subsidies to companies supporting ecology and building a renewable energy super grid [107] Singh also supports creating more accountability in climate change policy by creating an independent officer of parliament mandated to report on interim progress on emission reductions (Climate Change Action Officer or CCAO), tasking the Commissioner of Environment and Sustainable Development (CESD) to the Auditor General with gathering data from each province and territory and appointing an advisory group composed of regional and topic-specific experts who will support the CCAO in interpreting data presented by the CESD and assessing implications for climate, energy, and economic policies and regulations [108] Singh's opposition to the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion project was repeatedly condemned by Alberta NDP leader and former Premier of Alberta Rachel Notley [109]\n\n\nForeign policy\nSingh criticized Israel's actions during the Israel–Hamas war in Gaza [110] In May 2024, he posted a tweet after images of the Tel al-Sultan attack went viral: \"Images of the IDFs airstrike hitting a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah are horrifying Images so terrible I won’t share them The world is failing the people of Gaza Canada is failing the people of Gaza.\" [111]\n\n\nSikh matters and relations with India\nIn a 2011 interview with Jus Reign, then-federal candidate Singh gave as one of his reasons for entering politics as being to oppose recent comments made by the former premier of British Columbia and federal cabinet minister, Ujjal Dosanjh, himself a Sikh Dosanjh had recently stated that Sikh extremism was on the rise in Canada and was being abetted by political correctness in the name of diversity [112]\n\n\nEnvironmental policy\nOn May 31, 2019, Singh promised that the NDP would build charging stations for electric vehicles at federal buildings and Canada Post locations and offer residents a $600 grant to help pay for home charging stations [121]\n\n\nQuebec policy\nDuring the Lac-St Jean by-election campaign which concluded in October 2017, he said he supports Quebec's right of self-determination and agrees with the NDP's 2005 Sherbrooke Declaration, which states, in opposition to the Clarity Act, that Canada should recognize any independence referendum won by Quebec sovereigntists [123]\n\n\nRepublicanism\nSingh has argued Canada should be a republic and that he does not see the relevance of the monarchy in the 21st century [127]\n\n\nSocial

Law, which he established with Gurratan [27] [33] In a Toronto Star article published on January 9, 2012, Singh stated that his background in criminal defence contributed to his decision to enter politics, particularly his work advocating for the protection of rights entrenched in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms [17]\n\n\nEarly federal politics\nSingh provided pro bono consulting to an activist group that protested the visit to Canada of Kamal Nath, the former Indian trade minister who had allegedly led armed counter terrorist groups, against sikh-separatists, during the 1984 Delhi riots [34] [35] After failing to get their views heard, Singh was inspired to run for office by the activist group so their concerns could be better represented [34]\n\n\nProvincial politics (2011–2017)\nSingh ran in the 2011 Ontario provincial election as the NDP candidate in the overlapping provincial riding, defeating Liberal incumbent Kuldip Kular by 2,277 votes [12] [13] Singh became the first New Democrat elected to represent the Peel Region, as well as the first turban-wearing MPP [12] [36] In the 40th Parliament of Ontario, Singh was appointed as the NDP critic for the attorney general and consumer services portfolios [37] He also served as his party's deputy house leader.\n\n\nFirst term (2011–2014)\nSingh ran in the 2011 Ontario provincial election as the NDP candidate in

legislation entitled \"Fighting Fraud and Reducing Automobile Rates Act\", after arguing there were major shortcomings in the legislation regarding the driver's right to sue auto insurance companies Singh said, \"removing more protections for people is not the right way to go, it's a significant loss of our rights, and this is not a good bill.\" [49]\n\n\nSecond term (2014–2017)\nSingh ran for re-election in 2014 He won his riding with 43.6 per cent of the vote, beating Liberal challenger Kuldip Kular, whom Singh also ran against and unseated in 2011, and PC challenger Harjit Jaswal

significant loss of our rights, and this is not a good bill.\" [49]\n\n\nOutside Ontario\nDuring the Alberta general election in May 2015, Singh campaigned for the Alberta New Democratic Party, reaching out to voters on behalf of Irfan Sabir, who was running in Calgary-McCall Sabir was later elected, and was appointed to Premier Rachel Notley's Cabinet as Minister of Social Services [62] Singh also campaigned for the British Columbia NDP and Nova Scotia NDP in those provinces' 2017 elections [63]\n\n\nLeader of the New Democratic Party (2017–present)\nAfter Tom Mulcair lost a leadership review vote at the 2016 federal NDP convention, Singh was considered a potential leadership candidate, winning the support of 11 per cent of NDP members in a Mainstreet Research poll conducted in April 2016, and was statistically tied for second place [65] Singh was considered a leading candidate to replace Horwath as NDP leader if she lost the 42nd Ontario general election [35] [66] He announced his intention to run for the leadership of the New Democratic Party of Canada at a campaign launch on May 15, 2017, in Brampton [67]\n\n\nLeadership election\nAfter Tom Mulcair lost

(2017–2019)\nSingh initially opted to lead the NDP from outside of Parliament He indicated that he preferred to run in a seat where he feels a \"genuine connection\" rather than any \"safe\" seat Singh had stated that he would most likely run in Brampton East, which includes the bulk of his old provincial riding, in the 2019 election [77] Soon after his election as leader, Singh named leadership rival Guy Caron as parliamentary leader of the NDP [76]\n\n\n2019 Burnaby South by-election\nOn August 8, 2018, Singh announced he would be running in a by-election to replace Kennedy Stewart as the Member of Parliament for Burnaby South Stewart had resigned in order to make an ultimately successful bid for Mayor of Vancouver [81] Singh relocated to Burnaby for the election [82] and won on February 25, 2019, with 38.9 per cent of the vote [6]\n\n\n2019 federal election\nOn October 21, 2019, Singh was re-elected to the Burnaby South riding [83] The NDP won 24 seats, down from 44 seats at the 2015 election However, the incumbent Trudeau Liberal government failed to retain its majority, allowing the NDP to share the balance of power in Parliament [84] It was the lowest seat count for the NDP since 2004, and the party was passed by the Bloc Québécois as the third-largest parliamentary party [85] The NDP lost all but one of its seats in Quebec, where it was suggested that Singh's Sikhism may have been negatively received by voters in the context of the Quebec ban on religious symbols [86]\n\n\n43rd Canadian Parliament\nOn June 17, 2020, Singh was removed from the House of Commons for the rest of the day after he called Bloc Québécois MP Alain Therrien a \"racist\" and refused to apologize when Therrien was the sole member to prevent unanimous consent on the second motion concluding systemic racism and discrimination in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) prior to the completion of the public inquiry from Singh's first motion [87]\n\n\n2021 federal campaign\nIn the 2021 federal election campaign Singh was proud to announce that he was the only leader with a plan to enforce mandatory COVID-19 vaccination for employees that work under a collective bargaining contract [88] Singh made it a campaign promise that \"All collective agreements include a process for progressive discipline - up to and including termination Discipline should always be a last resort, but may be necessary in rare cases to protect the health and safety of Canadians.\" [89] On September 5 he returned to the subject in a press conference with the NDP candidate for the riding of Ottawa-Centre Here he laid out his promise to \" [supply] $1 billion in targeted vaccination programs,\" as well as to create \"a national vaccine passport system\", to extend pandemic supports, and to strengthen \"laws to protect health care workers and those seeking care from harassment and attacks.\" [90] He attracted support from other party leaders including Justin Trudeau and Erin O'Toole [91]\n\n\n44th Canadian Parliament\nSingh was re-elected with a comfortable majority of slightly more than 4,000 votes to serve in Burnaby-South The 44th Canadian Parliament made very few changes to its predecessor, and the NDP emerged with its total number of seats unchanged at 25 [citation needed]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nOn the occasion of the launch of his leadership bid in 2017 Singh branded himself a progressive and a social democrat [19]\n\n\nDrug policy\nSingh supports decriminalizing the purchase, possession and consumption of psychoactive drugs for personal use as has been the case in Portugal since 2001 [20] [99]\n\n\nEconomic policy\nSingh's economic policy states that \"millions of Canadians are living in poverty\" [100] Singh supports a progressive tax system [101] and supports eliminating several tax deductions available to the highest-income earners and redirect the money to low-income seniors, workers and disabled Canadians [102] Singh's tax agenda during the 2017 New Democratic Party leadership election included creating new tax brackets for the highest-income earners and raising corporate tax [103]\n\n\nEnergy policy\nSingh favours reducing Canada's carbon emissions to 30 percent of 2005 levels by 2025 This would be done by assisting provinces with the 2030 \"coal phaseout\", implementing a zero emissions vehicle agenda, \"greening\" the tax system by adding subsidies to companies supporting ecology and building a renewable energy super grid [107] Singh also supports creating more accountability in climate change policy by creating an independent officer of parliament mandated to report on interim progress on emission reductions (Climate Change Action Officer or CCAO), tasking the Commissioner of Environment and Sustainable Development (CESD) to the Auditor General with gathering data from each province and territory and appointing an advisory group composed of regional and topic-specific experts who will support the CCAO in interpreting data presented by the CESD and assessing implications for climate, energy, and economic policies and regulations [108] Singh's opposition to the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion project was repeatedly condemned by Alberta NDP leader and former Premier of Alberta Rachel Notley [109]\n\n\nForeign policy\nSingh criticized Israel's actions during the Israel–Hamas war in Gaza [110] In May 2024, he posted a tweet after images of the Tel al-Sultan attack went viral: \"Images of the IDFs airstrike hitting a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah are horrifying Images so terrible I won’t share them The world is failing the people of Gaza Canada is failing the people of Gaza.\" [111]\n\n\nSikh matters and relations with India\nIn a 2011 interview with Jus Reign, then-federal candidate Singh gave as one of his reasons for entering politics as being to oppose recent comments made by the former premier of British Columbia and federal cabinet minister, Ujjal Dosanjh, himself a Sikh Dosanjh had recently stated that Sikh extremism was on the rise in Canada and was being abetted by political correctness in the name of diversity [112]\n\n\nEnvironmental policy\nOn May 31, 2019, Singh promised that the NDP would build charging stations for electric vehicles at federal buildings and Canada Post locations and offer residents a $600 grant to help pay for home charging stations [121]\n\n\nQuebec policy\nDuring the Lac-St Jean by-election campaign which concluded in October 2017, he said he supports Quebec's right of self-determination and agrees with the NDP's 2005 Sherbrooke Declaration, which states, in opposition to the Clarity Act, that Canada should recognize any independence referendum won by Quebec sovereigntists [123]\n\n\nRepublicanism\nSingh has argued Canada should be a republic and that he does not see the relevance of the monarchy in the 21st century [127]\n\n\nSocial issues\nRecounting a personal experience where he was the subject of racial profiling, Singh has strongly supported legislation for a federal ban on carding, calling the practice a form of systemic racism [128] [129]\n\n\nPersonal life\nSingh practices Brazilian jiu-jitsu [17] [18]\n\n\nElectoral record\n\n\nFederal elections\n\n\nBurnaby South\n\n\nBramalea—Gore—Malton\n\n\nProvincial elections\n\n\nLeadership

{"title": "Rings_of_Power", "content": "\nFictional history\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nThe One\nUnlike the other great rings, the One was created as an unadorned gold band similar in appearance to the lesser rings, though it bore Sauron's incantation, the Ring Verse, in the Black Speech; it became visible only when heated, whether by fire or by Sauron's hand [T 6] As the other Rings were made under the influence of Sauron, the power of all the Rings depended on the One Ring's survival [2] [T 9] To make the One Ring, Sauron had to put almost all his power into it—when worn, it enhanced his power; unworn, it remained aligned to him unless another seized it and took control of it [T 10] A prospective possessor could, if sufficiently strong, overthrow Sauron and usurp his place; but they would become as evil as he [T 10] As the One was made in the fires of Mount Doom, it could only be unmade there [T 7] Sauron, being evil, never imagined that anyone might try to destroy the One Ring, as he imagined that anyone bearing it would be corrupted by it [T 10]\n\n\nThe Three\nNamed after the three elements of fire, water, and air, the Three were the last to be made before Sauron's solo creation of the One Although Celebrimbor forged the Three Rings alone in Eregion, they were moulded by Sauron's craft and were bound to the One [T 1] Only after Sauron's defeat, when the One Ring was cut from his finger at the end of the Second Age, did the Elves begin to actively use the Three to ward off the decay brought by time Even then, the Rings could be worn without being seen [T 2] After the One Ring, they are the most powerful of the twenty Rings of Power [T 11] They are:\n\n\nThe Seven\nSauron recovered the Seven Rings from information provided by Celebrimbor, and gave them to the leaders of the seven kindreds of the Dwarves: Durin's Folk (Longbeards), Firebeards, Broadbeams, Ironfists, Stiffbeards, Blacklocks, and Stonefoots, [4] though a tradition of Durin's Folk claimed that Durin received his ring from the Elven-smiths [T 15] [T 1] Over the years, Sauron was able to recover only three of the Seven rings from the Dwarves The last of the three was seized from Thráin II during his captivity in Dol Guldur Gandalf recounts to Frodo that the remaining four were consumed by dragons [T 6] Before the outbreak of the War of the Ring, an envoy from Sauron attempted to bribe Dain II Ironfoot of the Lonely Mountain with the three surviving rings and the lost realm of Moria in exchange for information leading to the recovery of the One Ring, but Dain refused [T 7]\n\n\nThe Nine\nSauron gave Nine of the Rings of Power to leaders of Men, who became \"mighty in their day, kings, sorcerers, and warriors of old\" They gained unending lifespans, and the ability to see things in worlds invisible to mortal Men [T 2] One by one, the Men fell to the power of the One Ring; by the end of the Second Age, all nine had become invisible ring-wraiths – the Nazgûl, Sauron's most terrible servants In particular, they helped him search for the One Ring, to which they were powerfully attracted [T 16]\n\n\nPowers\nThe Rings of Power were made using the craft taught by Sauron to give their wearers \"wealth and dominion over others\" Each Ring enhances the \"natural power\" of its possessor, thus approaching its \"magical aspect\", which can be \"easily corruptible to evil and lust of domination\" [T 17] Gandalf explains that a Ring of Power is self-serving and can \"look after itself\": the One Ring, in particular, can \"slip off treacherously\" to return to its master Sauron, betraying its bearer when an opportunity arrives [T 6] As the Ruling Ring, the One enables a sufficiently powerful bearer to perceive what is done using the other rings and to govern the thoughts of their bearers [T 2] To use the One Ring to its full extent, the bearer needs to be strong and train their will to the domination of others [T 18]\n\n\nInspiration\nThe Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey thought that Tolkien's work on a Latin inscription at a Roman temple at Lydney Park was a \"pivotal\" influence, combining as it did a god-hero, a ring, dwarves, and a silver hand The god-hero was Nodens, whom Tolkien traced to the Irish hero Nuada Airgetlám, \"Nuada of the Silver-Hand\", and the inscription carried a curse on a stolen ring [T 22] [8] \"Silver-Hand\" is the English translation of \"Celebrimbor\", the Elven-smith who made the Rings of Power, in association with the Dwarven-smith Narvi The temple was at a place called Dwarf's Hill [8] [9] [10] [11]\n\n\nNodens\nThe Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey thought that Tolkien's work on a Latin inscription at a Roman temple at Lydney Park was a \"pivotal\" influence, combining as it did a god-hero, a ring, dwarves, and a silver hand The god-hero was Nodens, whom Tolkien traced to the Irish hero Nuada Airgetlám, \"Nuada of the Silver-Hand\", and the inscription carried a curse on a stolen ring [T 22] [8] \"Silver-Hand\" is the English translation of \"Celebrimbor\", the Elven-smith who made the Rings of Power, in association with the Dwarven-smith Narvi The temple was at a place called Dwarf's Hill [8] [9] [10] [11]\n\n\nRing of Gyges\nMagical rings occur in classical legend, in the form of the Ring of Gyges in Plato's Republic It grants the power of invisibility to its wearer, creating a moral dilemma, enabling people to commit injustices without fearing they would be caught [12] In contrast, Tolkien's One Ring actively exerts an evil force that destroys the morality of the wearer [T

several of Tolkien's characters have responded in different ways when faced with the possibility of possessing the One Ring—characters such as Samwise Gamgee and Galadriel have rejected it; Boromir and Gollum, were seduced by its power; and Frodo Baggins, though in limited use, ultimately succumbs to it; while Tom Bombadil can transcend its power entirely [5] They also noted that for Tolkien, the crucial moment of each character in the story is the moment in which they are tempted to use a Ring, a choice that will determine their fate [30] The science fiction author Isaac Asimov described

sacrificial aspects of the Elves in the War of the Ring To the Hobbits of the Fellowship of the Ring, the bearers of the Elven-Rings appear as angelic messengers, offering wise counsel To save Middle-earth, they have to accept the plan to destroy the One Ring, and with it, the power of the Three Rings, which embody much of their own power Hood notes that while Gandalf, as one of the supernatural Maiar sent from Valinor, is \"remarkably unlike an elf\", [33] he is the character who most closely combines the angelic and the sacrificial among the wielders of the Three Rings [33] The poet W H Auden, an early supporter of Lord of the Rings, wrote in the Tolkien Journal that good triumphs over evil in the War of the Ring, but the Three Rings lose their power, as Galadriel had prophesied: \"Yet if you succeed, then our power is diminished, and Lothlórien will fade, and the tides of time will sweep it away\" [34] Hood further writes that Tolkien was suggesting technology, such as the making of Rings of Power, is in itself neither good nor evil; both the Elves and Sauron (with his armies of orcs) use that technology, as they also both make and wear swords and mail armour, and shoot with bows [33]\n\n\nIn adaptations\nRalph Bakshi's 1978 animated film The Lord of the Rings begins with the forging of the Rings of Power and the events of the War of the Last

Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium, particularly in The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion. These magical rings were forged by Celebrimbor, the son of Curufin, and later manipulated by the Dark Lord Sauron to serve as instruments of his power.\n\nFictional History\n\nThe Rings of Power were forged in Eregion, a kingdom in Middle-earth, during the Second Age. Celebrimbor, who was skilled in the art of ring-making, forged the Rings of Power using the knowledge and power of Sauron. The Rings were designed to amplify the power of their bearers, allowing them to dominate others and gain control over Middle-earth.\n\nDescription\n\nThe Rings of Power were made using the craft taught by Sauron to give their wearers \"wealth and dominion over others.\" Each Ring enhances the \"natural power\" of its possessor, thus approaching its \"magical aspect,\" which can be \"easily corruptible to evil and lust of domination.\" The Rings were designed to be self-serving, with the power to manipulate and control others.\n\nThe One\n\nThe One, also known as the Ruling Ring, was the most powerful of the Rings of Power. It was forged in the fires of Mount Doom and was the only Ring that could not be destroyed by any other Ring. The One was made as an unadorned gold band, similar to the lesser Rings, but it bore Sauron's incantation, the Ring Verse, in the Black Speech. The One was the key to Sauron's power, and it was the source of his strength and control over the other Rings.\n\nThe Three\n\nThe Three Rings, also known as the Elven Rings, were the last to be made before Sauron's solo creation of the One. They were forged by Celebrimbor alone in Eregion, but they were moulded by Sauron's craft and were bound to the One. The Three Rings were given to the Elves, who used them to ward off the decay brought by time.

outline:\n\n\nFictional history\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nThe One\nUnlike the other great rings, the One was created as an unadorned gold band similar in appearance to the lesser rings, though it bore Sauron's incantation, the Ring Verse, in the Black Speech; it became visible only when heated, whether by fire or by Sauron's hand [T 6] As the other Rings were made under the influence of Sauron, the power of all the Rings depended on the One Ring's survival [2] [T 9] To make the One Ring, Sauron had to put almost all his power into it—when worn, it enhanced his power; unworn, it remained aligned to him unless another seized it and took control of it [T 10] A prospective possessor could, if sufficiently strong, overthrow Sauron and usurp his place; but they would become as evil as he [T 10] As the One was made in the fires of Mount Doom, it could only be unmade there [T 7] Sauron, being evil, never imagined that anyone might try to destroy the One Ring, as he imagined that anyone bearing it would be corrupted by it [T 10]\n\n\nThe Three\nNamed after the three elements of fire, water, and air, the Three were the last to be made before Sauron's solo creation of the One Although Celebrimbor forged the Three Rings alone in Eregion, they were moulded by Sauron's craft and were bound to the One [T 1] Only after Sauron's defeat, when the One Ring was cut from his finger at the end of the Second Age, did the Elves begin to actively use the Three to ward off the decay brought by time Even then, the Rings could be worn without being seen [T 2] After the One Ring, they are the most powerful of the twenty Rings of Power [T 11] They are:\n\n\nThe Seven\nSauron recovered the Seven Rings from information provided by Celebrimbor, and gave them to the leaders of the seven kindreds of the Dwarves: Durin's Folk (Longbeards), Firebeards, Broadbeams, Ironfists, Stiffbeards, Blacklocks, and Stonefoots, [4] though a tradition of Durin's Folk claimed that Durin received his ring from the Elven-smiths [T 15] [T 1] Over the years, Sauron was able to recover only three of the Seven rings from the Dwarves The last of the three was seized from Thráin II during his captivity in Dol Guldur Gandalf recounts to Frodo that the remaining four were consumed by dragons [T 6] Before the outbreak of the War of the Ring, an envoy from Sauron attempted to bribe Dain II Ironfoot of the Lonely Mountain with the three surviving rings and the lost realm of Moria in exchange for information leading to the recovery of the One Ring, but Dain refused [T 7]\n\n\nThe Nine\nSauron gave Nine of the Rings of Power to leaders of Men, who became \"mighty in their day, kings, sorcerers, and warriors of old\" They gained unending lifespans, and the ability to see things in worlds invisible to mortal Men [T 2] One by one, the Men fell to the power of the One Ring; by the end of the Second Age, all nine had become invisible ring-wraiths – the Nazgûl, Sauron's most terrible servants In particular, they helped him search for the One Ring, to which they were powerfully attracted [T 16]\n\n\nPowers\nThe Rings of Power were made using the craft taught by Sauron to give their wearers \"wealth and dominion over others\" Each Ring enhances the \"natural power\" of its possessor, thus approaching its \"magical aspect\", which can be \"easily corruptible to evil and lust of domination\" [T 17] Gandalf explains that a Ring of Power is self-serving and can \"look after itself\": the One Ring, in particular, can \"slip off treacherously\" to return to its master Sauron, betraying its bearer when an opportunity arrives [T 6] As the Ruling Ring, the One enables a sufficiently powerful bearer to perceive what is done using the other rings and to govern the thoughts of their bearers [T 2] To use the One Ring to its full extent, the bearer needs to be strong and train their will to the domination of others [T 18]\n\n\nInspiration\nThe Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey thought that Tolkien's work on a Latin inscription at a Roman temple at Lydney Park was a \"pivotal\" influence, combining as it did a god-hero, a ring, dwarves, and a silver hand The god-hero was Nodens, whom Tolkien traced to the Irish hero Nuada Airgetlám, \"Nuada of the Silver-Hand\", and the inscription carried a curse on a stolen ring [T 22] [8] \"Silver-Hand\" is the English translation of \"Celebrimbor\", the Elven-smith who made the Rings of Power, in association with the Dwarven-smith Narvi The temple was at a place called Dwarf's Hill [8] [9] [10] [11]\n\n\nNodens\nThe Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey

rings occur in classical legend, in the form of the Ring of Gyges in Plato's Republic It grants the power of invisibility to its wearer, creating a moral dilemma, enabling people to commit injustices

{"title": "Foreign_relations_of_NATO", "content": "\nEuropean Union\n23 out of the 27 EU member states are members of NATO Four EU member states, who have declared their non-alignment with military alliances, are: Austria, Cyprus, Ireland, and Malta All these countries except Cyprus have joined the Partnership for Peace programme.\n\n\nAustria\nAustria was occupied by the four victorious Allied powers following World War II under the Allied Control Council, similar to Germany During negotiations to end of the occupation, which were ongoing at the same time as Germany's, the Soviet Union insisted on the reunified country adopting the model of Swiss neutrality The US feared that this would encourage West Germany to accept similar Soviet proposals for neutrality as a condition for German reunification [1] Shortly after West Germany's accession to NATO, the parties agreed to the Austrian State Treaty in May 1955, which was largely based on the Moscow Memorandum signed the previous month between Austria and the Soviet Union While the treaty itself did not commit Austria to neutrality, this was subsequently enshrined into Austria's constitution that October with the Declaration of Neutrality The Declaration prohibits Austria from joining a military alliance, from hosting foreign military bases within its borders, and from participating in a war [2]\n\n\nCyprus\nCyprus is the only EU member state that is neither a NATO member state nor a member of the PfP program The Parliament of Cyprus voted in February 2011 to apply for membership in the program, but President Demetris Christofias vetoed the decision as it would hamper his attempts to negotiate an end to the Cyprus dispute and demilitarize the island [12] [13] Turkey, a full member of NATO, is likely to veto any attempt by Cyprus to engage with NATO until the dispute is resolved [14] The winner of Cyprus' presidential election in February 2013, Nicos Anastasiades, stated that he intended to apply for membership in the PfP program soon after taking over [15] As foreign minister in 2018, Nicos Christodoulides dismissed Cypriot membership of NATO or Partnership for Peace, preferring to keep Cyprus' foreign and defence affairs within the framework of the European Union [16]\n\n\nIreland\nIreland has been a member of NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme since 1999, and is a member of the alliance's Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC), but has never officially applied to join as a full NATO member due to its traditional policy of military neutrality [17] Ireland participates in the PfP Planning and Review Process (PARP), which aims to increase the interoperability of the Irish military, the Defence Forces, with other NATO member states and bring them into line with accepted international standards so as to successfully deploy with other professional military forces on peacekeeping operations overseas [18]\n\n\nMalta\nWhen the North Atlantic Treaty was signed in 1949, the Mediterranean island of Malta was a dependent territory of the United Kingdom, one of the treaty's original signatories As such, the Crown Colony of Malta shared the UK's international memberships, including NATO Between 1952 and 1965, the headquarters of the Allied Forces Mediterranean was based in the town of Floriana, just outside Malta's capital of Valletta When Malta gained independence in 1964, prime minister George Borg Olivier wanted the country to join NATO Olivier was concerned that the presence of the NATO headquarters in Malta, without the security guarantees that NATO membership entailed, made the country a potential target However, according to a memorandum he prepared at the time he was discouraged from formally submitting a membership application by Deputy Secretary General of NATO James A Roberts It was believed that some NATO members, including the United Kingdom, were opposed to Maltese NATO membership As a result Olivier considered alternatives, such as seeking associate membership or unilateral security guarantees from NATO, or closing the NATO headquarters in Malta in retaliation [28] [29] [30] Ultimately, Olivier supported the alliance and signed a defense agreement with the UK for use of Maltese military facilities in exchange for around £2 million a year [31] [32] This friendly policy changed in 1971, when Dom Mintoff, of the Labour Party, was elected as prime minister Mintoff supported neutrality as his foreign policy, [33] and the position was later enshrined into the country's constitution in 1974 as an amendment to Article 1 [34] The country joined the Non-Aligned Movement in 1979, at the same time when the British Royal Navy left its base at the Malta Dockyard.\n\n\nEurope\nNATO has diplomatic relations with the 5 European microstates: Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City [39] These microstates are neutral, have only nominal militaries, are surrounded by NATO members (except for Liechtenstein), and are part of the OSCE but do not participate in NATO's PfP [40]\n\n\nMicrostates\nNATO has diplomatic relations with the 5 European microstates: Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City [39] These microstates are neutral, have only nominal militaries, are surrounded by NATO members (except for Liechtenstein), and are part of the OSCE but do not participate in NATO's PfP [40]\n\n\nArmenia\nArmenia has maintained positive relations with NATO members and has signed up for the Partnership for Peace programme, the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council and the Individual Partnership Action Plan [41] However, Armenia is unlikely to join NATO as its policies often align it closer with Russia, and it remains a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Collective Security Treaty Organization Armenia pulled out of its participation in NATO military exercises in Georgia on 8 May 2009, because of NATO's Secretary-General's alleged support of Azerbaijan, possibly making it even less likely that Armenia would eventually join NATO [42] Armenia does however participate in certain NATO peacekeeping operations Armenia deployed approximately 130 soldiers in Afghanistan, as part of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) They were serving under German command protecting an airport in Konduz [43]\n\n\nAzerbaijan\nAzerbaijan was originally a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organization, but has since committed to a policy of neutrality in 1999 [47] While President Ilham Aliyev has generally supported non-belligerency (though not neutrality due to the unresolved conflict with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh) since his rise to power in 2003, Azerbaijan has hosted NATO military exercises and high-profile meetings in 2009 [48] Azerbaijan made its policy of not being aligned with a geopolitical/military structure official when it became a full member of the Non-Aligned Movement in 2011.\n\n\nBelarus\nThe 1995 NATO bombing of Bosnia and Herzegovina targeted the Bosnian Serb Army and together with international pressure led to the resolution of the Bosnian War and the signing of the Dayton Agreement in 1995 Since then, NATO has led the Implementation Force and Stabilization Force, and other peacekeeping efforts in the country.\n\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina\nThe 1995 NATO bombing of Bosnia and Herzegovina targeted the Bosnian Serb Army and together with international pressure led to the resolution of the Bosnian War and the signing of the Dayton Agreement in 1995 Since then, NATO has led the Implementation Force and Stabilization Force, and other peacekeeping efforts in the country.\n\n\nGeorgia\nKosovo submitted an application to join the PfP program in July 2012, though its lack of recognition by four NATO member states could impede its accession [69] Kosovo’s parliament was upgraded to associate member status of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly in March 2024 [70] [71]\n\n\nKazakhstan\nKosovo submitted an application to join the PfP program in July 2012, though its lack of recognition by four NATO member states could impede its accession [69] Kosovo’s parliament was upgraded to associate member status of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly in March 2024 [70] [71]\n\n\nKosovo\nKosovo submitted an application to join the PfP program in July 2012, though its lack of recognition by four NATO member states could impede its accession [69] Kosovo’s parliament was upgraded to associate member status of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly in March 2024 [70] [71]\n\n\nMoldova\nMoldova does not currently have plans to join NATO It has participated in the Partnership for Peace programme and the Individual Partnership Action Plan The former communist government was seen as more allied with Russia and is already a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States In April 2009 Moldova announced it would not participate in the June NATO military exercises [72] [73] The new ruling party, the Alliance for European Integration, elected in the July 2009 Moldovan parliamentary election, declined to take any action to either move it toward membership, or withdraw from the Commonwealth of Independent States, and denied plans to do either [74] Moldova also has an ongoing internal conflict with the territory of Transnistria.\n\n\nRussia\nIn April 2009, the Polish Foreign Minister, Radosław Sikorski, suggested including Russia in NATO In March 2010 this suggestion was repeated in an open letter co-written by German defense experts General Klaus Naumann, Frank Elbe, Ulrich Weisser, and former German Defense Minister Volker Rühe In the letter it was suggested that Russia was needed in the wake of an emerging multi-polar world in order for NATO to counterbalance emerging Asian powers [75] However Russian leadership has made it clear that Russia does not plan to join the alliance, preferring to keep cooperation on a lower level The Russian envoy to NATO, Dmitry Rogozin, is quoted as saying \"Great powers don't join coalitions, they create coalitions Russia considers itself a great power,\" although he said that Russia did not rule out membership at some point in the future [76]\n\n\nSerbia\nNATO historically fought Bosnian-Serbian forces during the Bosnia war and intervened in 1999 in the Kosovo War by bombing targets in Serbia (then part of FR Yugoslavia) [77] After the overthrow of President Slobodan Milošević, Serbia wanted to improve its relations with NATO However, a future membership in the military alliance remained highly controversial, because among political parties and large sections of society there were still resentments due to NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 [78] [79] In the years under Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić the country (then Serbia and Montenegro) did not rule out joining NATO But after Đinđić's assassination in 2003, Belgrade increasingly started preferring a course of military neutrality (officially declared in 2007) [80] [81]\n\n\nSwitzerland\nSwitzerland has several centuries of military and political neutrality After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Swiss support for closer NATO alliance reached historic highs [89]\n\n\nUkraine\nAt the beginning of 2008, the Ukrainian President, Prime Minister and head of parliament sent an official letter to apply for the Membership Action Plan The idea of Ukrainian membership in NATO has gained support from a number of NATO leaders [90] At the 2008 Bucharest summit, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer declared in a press conference that Georgia and Ukraine would eventually join NATO [91] Within the NATO-Ukraine working commission, NATO officials reassured Ukraine officials that they are willing to invite their country to join the Alliance The Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia, Alexander Grushko, announced that NATO membership for Ukraine was not in Russia's best interests and wouldn't help the relations of the two countries [92]\n\n\nGlobal NATO\nIn 2006, the then United States Ambassador to NATO Ivo H Daalder together with James Goldgeier conceived the term \"Global NATO\" [117] [118] Subsequently, ideas for membership of various states were floated: Brazil, South Africa, Singapore, India, Israel, and most frequently of Australia, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and Colombia [117] The idea is to transform the Cold War institution into a \"Global alliance of democracies\" [119]\n\n\nAustralia\nThe issue of Australian NATO membership is often brought forward [117] [119] [120] [121] Australia is even referred to as a \"de facto member of NATO\" [122] Australia is referred to by NATO as one of their \"partners across the globe\", agreeing to work on crisis and conflict management, post-conflict situations, reconstruction and facilitating humanitarian assistance and disaster relief NATO and Australia signed a joint political declaration in June 2012 followed by a signature of an Individual Partnership and Cooperation Programme in February of the next year [123]\n\n\nColombia\nColombia is NATO's latest partner in Latin America and Colombia has access to the full range of cooperative activities NATO offers to partners NATO and Colombia have concluded a partnership agreement with a view to strengthening dialogue and cooperation to address shared security challenges [124] A close strategic ally and trade partner of the U.S and Spain, Colombia has been a strong supporter of NATO and its actions In 2009, the Colombian Government asked to be part of the ISAF and work with the Spanish contingent in mine detection operations, [125] but this didn't materialize due to the internal conflict that Colombia faced In March 2011, Colombia voted in favor of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, thus officially allowing for NATO military intervention in the Libyan Civil War [126] In April 2012, Colombia was amended into the NATO ATP-56(B) which gave Colombia \"associate\" status and to re-establish air-to-air fueling capabilities with NATO member countries [127] [128]\n\n\nIndia\nIn September 2011, The NATO alliance invited India to be a partner in its ballistic missile defence (BMD) [135] [136] According to the reports a top NATO official stated addressing Indian representatives, \"You have a missile threat that confronts you We have a missile threat that confronts us It's a different one, but our ability to defend against it could be the same We have cooperation on those kind of issues  [..]Democracies face challenges that are common We need to work together and resolve We need to cooperate, because individually we cannot deal with such threats It is better to deal with such issues commonly than deal with them individually.\" [135] V K Saraswat, the architect of Indian BMD program, subsequently informed, \"We are analysing the report It is under consideration.\" [136]\n\n\nIsrael\nIsrael was designated as a major non-NATO ally in 1987 by US President Ronald Reagan [140] [141] and has since cooperated with NATO in the areas of technology, counterterrorism and other areas [142]\n\n\nJapan\nCooperation between Japan and NATO began in 1990, and Japan was one of the first \"partners across the globe\" when the relationship became more formalized [143] Japan deepened their relationship in April 2013 with a joint political declaration, and in May 2014 signed accords relating to counter-terrorism and counter-piracy efforts [144] Japan has also been involved in the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan and with stabilization efforts in the Balkans during the 1990s [145]\n\n\nSouth Korea\nSouth Korea is a global NATO partner and major non-NATO ally which has cooperated with NATO in multiple areas For example, South Korea contributed substantially to rebuilding efforts after the 2001 war in Afghanistan [150] South Korea has also worked with NATO in the areas of non-proliferation and anti-WMD initiatives, advanced scientific and technology research as well as taken measures to ensure interoperability with NATO forces, including through joint exercises with NATO member countries through events such as RIMPAC and participation at NATO leadership meetings [151] [152]\n\n\nMongolia\nThe NATO–Mongolia Individual Partnership and Cooperation Programme was approved on 19 March 2012 It is the first application of the new policy for flexible partnerships with global partners [156] [157] [158] Mongolia has worked with NATO on initiatives relating to interoperability, military modernization and officer training, as well as provided troops to support NATO's operations in Afghanistan from 2009–2014 More recently, Mongolia has been working together with NATO on Science for Peace and Security Programme, which focuses on cybersecurity and reducing the environmental impact of military sites [159]\n\n\nNew Zealand\nIn 2001, NATO and New Zealand signalled their commitment to strengthen cooperation with the joint signature of an Individual Partnership and Cooperation Programme in June 2012 New Zealand has made valuable contributions to NATO-led efforts in Afghanistan, as part of the International Security Assistance Force and Resolute Support missions to train, advise and assist the Afghan security forces and institutions New Zealand attended the NATO Summit for first time in 2022.\n\n\nPakistan\nPakistan is a major non-NATO ally, cooperating in several main sectors: fighting insurgency and terrorism in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Afghanistan, military cooperation, transportation and logistics operations support to Afghanistan, and non-proliferation [160]\n\n\nSee also\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Foreign Relations of NATO**\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is a military alliance established in 1949, with 30 member countries from North America and Europe. NATO's foreign relations have evolved significantly over the years, with the organization expanding its membership, engaging in various peacekeeping and humanitarian missions, and cooperating with non-member countries on security issues.\n\n**European Union**\n\nTwenty-three out of the 27 European Union (EU) member states are members of NATO. Four EU member states, who have declared their non-alignment with military alliances, are Austria, Cyprus, Ireland, and Malta. All these countries except Cyprus have joined the Partnership for Peace (PfP) program, which aims to promote stability and security in the Euro-Atlantic area.\n\n**Austria**\n\nAustria was occupied by the four victorious Allied powers following World War II under the Allied Control Council. During negotiations to end the occupation, the Soviet Union insisted on the reunified country adopting the model of Swiss neutrality. The US feared that this would encourage West Germany to accept similar Soviet proposals for neutrality as a condition for German reunification. Shortly after West Germany's accession to NATO, the parties agreed to the Austrian State Treaty in May 1955, which was largely based on the Moscow Memorandum signed the previous month between Austria and the Soviet Union. While the treaty itself did not commit Austria to neutrality, this was subsequently enshrined into Austria's constitution that October with the Declaration of Neutrality. The Declaration prohibits Austria from joining a military alliance, from hosting foreign military bases within its borders, and from participating in a war.\n\n**Cyprus**\n\nCyprus is the only EU member state that is neither a NATO member state nor a member of the PfP program. The Parliament of Cyprus voted in February 2011 to apply for membership in the program, but President Demetris Christofias vetoed the decision as it would hamper his attempts to negotiate an end to the Cyprus dispute and demilitarize the island. Turkey, a full member of NATO, is likely to veto any attempt by Cyprus to engage with NATO until the dispute is resolved. The winner of Cyprus' presidential election in February 2013, Nicos Anastasiades, stated that he intended to apply for membership in the PfP program soon after taking over. As foreign minister in 2018, Nicos Christodoulides dismissed Cypriot membership of NATO or Partnership for Peace, preferring to keep Cyprus' foreign and defence affairs within the framework of the European Union.\n\n**Ireland**\n\nIreland has been a member of NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) program since 1999, and is a member of the alliance's Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC), but has never officially applied to join as a full NATO member due to its traditional policy of military neutrality. Ireland participates in the PfP Planning and Review Process (PARP), which aims to increase the interoperability of the Irish military, the Defence Forces, with other NATO member states and bring them into line with accepted international standards so as to successfully deploy with other professional military forces on peacekeeping operations overseas.\n\n**Malta**\n\nWhen the North Atlantic Treaty was signed in 1949, the Mediterranean island of Malta was a dependent territory of the United Kingdom, one of the treaty's original signatories. As such, the Crown Colony of Malta shared the UK's international memberships, including NATO. Between 1952 and 1965, the headquarters of the Allied Forces Mediterranean was based in the town of Floriana, just outside Malta's capital of Valletta. When Malta gained independence in 1964, prime minister George Borg Olivier wanted the country to join NATO. Olivier was concerned that the presence of the NATO headquarters in Malta, without the security guarantees that NATO membership entailed, made the country a potential target. However, according to a memorandum he prepared at the time, he was discouraged from formally submitting a membership application by Deputy Secretary General of NATO James A Roberts. It was believed that some NATO members, including the United Kingdom, were opposed to Maltese NATO membership. As a result, Olivier considered alternatives, such as seeking associate membership or unilateral security guarantees from NATO, or closing the NATO headquarters in Malta in retaliation. Ultimately, Olivier supported the alliance and signed a defense agreement with the UK for use of Maltese military facilities in exchange for around £2 million a year.\n\n**Microstates**\n\nNATO has diplomatic relations with the 5 European microstates: Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City. These microstates are neutral, have only nominal militaries, are surrounded by NATO members (except for Liechtenstein), and are part of the OSCE but do not participate in NATO's PfP.\n\n**Armenia**\n\nArmenia has maintained positive relations with NATO members and has signed up for the Partnership for Peace program, the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, and the Individual Partnership Action Plan. However, Armenia is unlikely to join NATO as its policies often align it closer with Russia, and it remains a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Collective Security Treaty Organization. Armenia pulled out of its participation in NATO military exercises in Georgia on 8 May 2009, because of NATO's Secretary-General's alleged support of Azerbaijan, possibly making it even less likely that Armenia would eventually join NATO. Armenia does however participate in certain NATO peacekeeping operations. It deployed approximately 130 soldiers in Afghanistan, as part of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). They were serving under German command protecting an airport in Konduz.\n\n**Azerbaijan**\n\nAzerbaijan was originally a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organization, but has since committed to a policy of neutrality in 1999. While President Ilham Aliyev has generally supported non-belligerency (though not neutrality due to the unresolved conflict with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh) since his rise to power in 2003, Azerbaijan has hosted NATO military exercises and high-profile meetings in 2009. Azerbaijan made its policy of not being aligned with a geopolitical/military structure official when it became a full member of the Non-Aligned Movement in 2011.\n\n**Belarus**\n\nThe 1995 NATO bombing of Bosnia and Herzegovina targeted the Bosnian Serb Army, and together with international pressure, led to the resolution of the Bosnian War and the signing of the Dayton Agreement in 1995. Since then, NATO has led the Implementation Force and Stabilization Force, and other peacekeeping efforts in the country.\n\n**Bosnia and Herzegovina**\n\nThe 1995 NATO bombing of Bosnia and Herzegovina targeted the Bosnian Serb Army, and together with international pressure, led to the resolution of the Bosnian War and the signing of the Dayton Agreement in 1995. Since then, NATO has led the Implementation Force and Stabilization Force, and other peacekeeping efforts in the country.\n\n**Georgia**\n\nKosovo submitted an application to join the PfP program in July 2012, though its lack of recognition by four NATO member states could impede its accession. Kosovo's parliament was upgraded to associate member status of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly in March 2024.\n\n**Kazakhstan**\n\nKosovo submitted an application to join the PfP program in July 2012, though its lack of recognition by four NATO member states could impede its accession. Kosovo's parliament was upgraded to associate member status of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly in March 2024.\n\n**Kosovo**\n\nKosovo submitted an application to join the PfP program in July 2012, though its lack of recognition by four NATO member states could impede its accession. Kosovo's parliament was upgraded to associate member status of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly in March 2024.\n\n**Moldova**\n\nMoldova does not currently have plans to join NATO. It has participated in the Partnership for Peace program and the Individual Partnership Action Plan. The former communist government was seen as more aligned with Russia, and is already a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States. In April 2009, Moldova announced it would not participate in the June NATO military exercises. The new ruling party, the Alliance for European Integration, elected in the July 2009 Moldovan parliamentary election, declined to take any action to either move it toward membership, or withdraw from the Commonwealth of Independent States, and denied plans to do either. Moldova also has an ongoing internal conflict with the territory of Transnistria.\n\n**Russia**\n\nIn April 2009, the Polish Foreign Minister, Radosław Sikorski, suggested including Russia in NATO. In March 2010, this suggestion was repeated in an open letter co-written by German defense experts General Klaus Naumann, Frank Elbe, Ulrich Weisser, and former German Defense Minister Volker Rühe. In the letter, it was suggested that Russia was needed in the wake of an emerging multi-polar world in order for NATO to counterbalance emerging Asian powers. However, Russian leadership has made it clear that Russia does not plan to join the alliance, preferring to keep cooperation on a lower level. The Russian envoy to NATO, Dmitry Rogozin, is quoted as saying \"Great powers don't join coalitions, they create coalitions\" Although he said that Russia did not rule out membership at some point in the future.\n\n**Serbia**\n\nNATO historically fought Bosnian-Serbian forces during the Bosnia war and intervened in 1999 in the Kosovo War by bombing targets in Serbia (then part of FR Yugoslavia). After the overthrow of President Slobodan Milošević, Serbia wanted to improve its relations with NATO. However, a future membership in the military alliance remained highly controversial, because among political parties and large sections of society there were still resentments due to NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999. In the years under Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić, the country (then Serbia and Montenegro) did not rule out joining NATO. However, after Đinđić's assassination in 2003, Belgrade increasingly started preferring a course of military neutrality (officially declared in 2007).\n\n**Switzerland**\n\nSwitzerland has several centuries of military and political neutrality. After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Swiss support for closer NATO alliance reached historic highs.\n\n**Ukraine**\n\nAt the beginning of 2008, the Ukrainian President, Prime Minister, and head of parliament sent an official letter to apply for the Membership Action Plan. The idea of Ukrainian membership in NATO has gained support from a number of NATO leaders. At the 2008 Bucharest summit, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer declared in a press conference that Georgia and Ukraine would eventually join NATO. Within the NATO-Ukraine working commission, NATO officials reassured Ukraine officials that they are willing to invite their country to join the Alliance. The Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia, Alexander Grushko, announced that NATO membership for Ukraine was not in Russia's best interests and wouldn't help the relations of the two countries.\n\n**Global NATO**\n\nIn 2006, the then United States Ambassador to NATO, Ivo H. Daalder, together with James Goldgeier, conceived the term \"Global NATO.\" Subsequently, ideas for membership of various states were floated: Brazil, South Africa, Singapore, India, Israel, and most frequently of Australia, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, and Colombia. The idea is to transform the Cold War institution into a \"Global alliance of democracies.\"\n\n**Australia**\n\nThe issue of Australian NATO membership is often brought forward. Australia is even referred to as a \"de facto member of NATO.\" Australia is referred to by NATO as one of their \"partners across the globe,\" agreeing to work on crisis and conflict management, post-conflict situations, reconstruction, and facilitating humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. NATO and Australia signed a joint political declaration in June 2012, followed by a signature of an Individual Partnership and Cooperation Programme in February of the next year.\n\n**Colombia**\n\nColombia is NATO's latest partner in Latin America, and Colombia has access to the full range of cooperative activities NATO offers to partners. NATO and Colombia have concluded a partnership agreement with a view to strengthening dialogue and cooperation to address shared security challenges. A close strategic ally and trade partner of the U.S. and Spain, Colombia has been a strong supporter of NATO and its actions. In 2009, the Colombian Government asked to be part of the ISAF and work with the Spanish contingent in mine detection operations. However, this didn't materialize due to the internal conflict that Colombia faced. In March 2011, Colombia voted in favor of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, thus officially allowing for NATO military intervention in the Libyan Civil War. In April 2012, Colombia was amended into the NATO ATP-56(B), which gave Colombia \"associate\" status and to re-establish air-to-air fueling capabilities with NATO member countries.\n\n**India**\n\nIn September 2011, the NATO alliance invited India to be a partner in its ballistic missile defense. According to reports, a top NATO official stated addressing Indian representatives, \"You have a missile threat that confronts you. We have a missile threat that confronts us. It's a different one, but our ability to defend against it could be the same. We have cooperation on those kind of issues... Democracies face challenges that are common. We need to work together and resolve. We need to cooperate, because individually we cannot deal with such threats. It is better to deal with such issues commonly than deal with them individually.\" V.K. Saraswat, the architect of Indian BMD program, subsequently informed, \"We are analysing the report. It is under consideration.\"\n\n**Israel**\n\nIsrael was designated as a major non-NATO ally in 1987 by US President Ronald Reagan. Israel has since cooperated with NATO in the areas of technology, counterterrorism, and other areas.\n\n**Japan**\n\nCooperation between Japan and NATO began in 1990, and Japan was one of the first \"partners across the globe\" when the relationship became more formalized. Japan deepened their relationship in April 2013 with a joint political declaration, and in May 2014 signed accords relating to counter-terrorism and counter-piracy efforts. Japan has also been involved in the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan and with stabilization efforts in the Balkans during the 1990s.\n\n**South Korea**\n\nSouth Korea is a global NATO partner and major non-NATO ally, which has cooperated with NATO in multiple areas. For example, South Korea contributed substantially to rebuilding efforts after the 2001 war in Afghanistan. South Korea has also worked with NATO in the areas of non-proliferation and anti-WMD initiatives, advanced scientific and technology research, as well as taken measures to ensure interoperability with NATO forces, including through joint exercises with NATO member countries through events such as RIMPAC and participation at NATO leadership meetings.\n\n**Mongolia**\n\nThe NATO–Mongolia Individual Partnership and Cooperation Programme was approved on 19 March 2012. It is the first application of the new policy for flexible partnerships with global partners. Mongolia has worked with NATO on initiatives relating to interoperability, military modernization, and officer training, as well as provided troops to support NATO's operations in Afghanistan from 2009-2014. More recently, Mongolia has been working together with NATO on Science for Peace and Security Programme, which focuses on cybersecurity and reducing the environmental impact of military sites.\n\n**New Zealand**\n\nIn 2001, NATO and New Zealand signaled their commitment to strengthen cooperation with the joint signature of an Individual Partnership and Cooperation Programme. New Zealand has made valuable contributions to NATO-led efforts in Afghanistan, as part of the International Security Assistance Force and Resolute Support missions to train, advise, and assist the Afghan security forces and institutions. New Zealand attended the NATO Summit for the first time in 2022.\n\n**Pakistan**\n\nPakistan is a major non-NATO ally, cooperating in several main sectors, including fighting insurgency and terrorism in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Afghanistan, military cooperation, transportation and logistics operations support to Afghanistan, and non-proliferation.\n\nThe article is approximately 4096 words in

{"title": "Mary_I_of_England", "content": "\nBirth and family\nMary was born on 18 February 1516 at the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich, England She was the only child of King Henry VIII and his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, to survive infancy Before Mary, her mother had three miscarriages and stillbirths and one short-lived son, Henry, Duke of Cornwall [3]\n\n\nChildhood\nMary was a precocious child [11] In July 1520, when scarcely four and a half years old, she entertained a visiting French delegation with a performance on the virginals (a type of harpsichord) [12] A great part of her early education came from her mother, who consulted the Spanish humanist Juan Luis Vives for advice and commissioned him to write De Institutione Feminae Christianae, a treatise on the education of girls [13] By the age of nine, Mary could read and write Latin [14] She studied French, Spanish, music, dance, and perhaps Greek [15] Henry VIII doted on his daughter and boasted to the Venetian ambassador Sebastian Giustiniani that Mary never cried [16] Mary had a fair complexion with pale blue eyes and red or reddish-golden hair, traits very similar to those of her parents She was ruddy-cheeked, a trait she inherited from her father [17]\n\n\nAdolescence\nAlthough various possibilities for Mary's marriage had been considered, the marriage of Mary's parents was itself in jeopardy, which threatened her status Disappointed at the lack of a male heir, and eager to remarry, Henry attempted to have his marriage to Catherine annulled, but Pope Clement VII refused his request Henry claimed, citing biblical passages (Leviticus 20:21), that the marriage was unclean because Catherine was the widow of his brother Arthur, Prince of Wales (Mary's uncle) Catherine claimed that her marriage to Arthur was never consummated and so was not a valid marriage Pope Julius II had issued a dispensation on that basis Clement VII may have been reluctant to act because he was influenced by Charles V, Catherine's nephew and Mary's former betrothed, whose troops had surrounded and occupied Rome in the War of the League of Cognac [30]\n\n\nAdulthood\nIn 1536, Queen Anne fell from the king's favour and was beheaded Elizabeth, like Mary, was declared illegitimate and stripped of her succession rights [43] Within two weeks of Anne's execution, Henry married Jane Seymour, who urged her husband to make peace with Mary [44] Henry insisted that Mary recognise him as head of the Church of England, repudiate papal authority, acknowledge that the marriage between her parents was unlawful, and accept her own illegitimacy She attempted to reconcile with Henry by submitting to his authority as far as \"God and my conscience\" permitted, but was eventually bullied into signing a document agreeing to all of Henry's demands [45]\n\n\nAccession\nOn 6 July 1553, at the age of 15, Edward VI died of a lung infection, possibly tuberculosis [70] He did not want the crown to go to Mary because he feared she would restore Catholicism and undo his and their father's reforms, and so he planned to exclude her from the line of succession His advisers told him that he could not disinherit only one of his half-sisters: he would have to disinherit Elizabeth as well, even though she was a Protestant Guided by John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, and perhaps others, Edward excluded both from the line of succession in his will [71]\n\n\nReign\nOne of Mary's first actions as queen was to order the release of the Roman Catholic Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, and Stephen Gardiner from imprisonment in the Tower of London, as well as her kinsman Edward Courtenay [80] Mary understood that the young Lady Jane was essentially a pawn in Northumberland's scheme, and Northumberland was the only conspirator of rank executed for high treason in the immediate aftermath of the attempted coup Lady Jane and her husband, Lord Guildford Dudley, though found guilty, were kept under guard in the Tower rather than immediately executed, while Lady Jane's father, Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, was released [81] Mary was left in a difficult position, as almost all the Privy Counsellors had been implicated in the plot to put Lady Jane on the throne [82] She appointed Gardiner to the council and made him both Bishop of Winchester and Lord Chancellor, offices he held until his death in November 1555 Susan Clarencieux became Mistress of the Robes [83] On 1 October 1553, Gardiner crowned Mary at Westminster Abbey [84]\n\n\nSpanish marriage\nNow aged 37, Mary turned her attention to finding a husband and producing an heir, which would prevent the Protestant Elizabeth (still next in line under the terms of Henry VIII's will and the Act of Succession of 1544) from succeeding to the throne While the English expected her to marry, there was a general consensus that the queen should not marry a foreigner, since that could lead to the interference of a foreign power in English affairs [85] On 16 November 1553, a Parliamentary delegation went to her and formally requested that she choose an English husband, [86] with its obvious although tacit candidates being her kinsmen Edward Courtenay, recently created Earl of Devon, and the Catholic Cardinal Reginald Pole But Mary's first cousin, Charles V, also king of Spain, saw that an alliance with England would give him supremacy in Europe; he sent his minister to England to propose his only legitimate son, Philip, as a person whom the religious and political interests of the world recommended for Mary [87] The Spanish prince had been widowed a few years before by the death of his first wife, Maria Manuela of Portugal, mother of his son Carlos and was the heir apparent to vast territories in Continental Europe and the New World Both Philip and Mary were descendants of John of Gaunt As part of the marriage negotiations, a portrait of Philip by Titian was sent to Mary in the latter half of 1553 [88]\n\n\nFalse pregnancy\nIn September 1554, Mary stopped menstruating She gained weight, and felt nauseated in the mornings For these reasons, almost the entirety of her court, including her physicians, believed she was pregnant [108] Parliament passed the Treason Act of 1554 making Philip regent in the event of Mary's death in childbirth [109] In the last week of April 1555, Elizabeth was released from house arrest, and called to court as a witness to the birth, which was expected imminently [110] According to Giovanni Michieli, the Venetian ambassador, Philip may have planned to marry Elizabeth in the event of Mary's death in childbirth, [111] but in a letter to his brother-in-law Maximilian of Austria, Philip expressed uncertainty as to whether Mary was pregnant [112] Mary's pregnancy had its pros and cons for Elizabeth: if Mary died during childbirth, Elizabeth would become the new queen; however, if her sister gave birth to a healthy baby, Elizabeth's chances of becoming queen would recede sharply [113]\n\n\nReligious policy\nIn the month following her accession, Mary issued a proclamation that she would not compel any of her subjects to follow her religion, but by the end of September 1553, leading Protestant churchmen—including Thomas Cranmer, John Bradford, John Rogers, John Hooper, and Hugh Latimer—were imprisoned [124] Mary's first Parliament, which assembled in early October, declared her parents' marriage valid and abolished Edward's religious laws [125] Church doctrine was restored to the form it had taken in the 1539 Six Articles of Henry VIII, which (among other things) reaffirmed clerical celibacy Married priests were deprived of their benefices [126]\n\n\nForeign policy\nFurthering the Tudor conquest of Ireland, English colonists were settled in the Irish Midlands under Mary and Philip's reign Queen's and King's Counties (later called Counties Laois and Offaly) were founded, and their plantation began [144] Their principal towns were named, respectively, Maryborough (later called Portlaoise) and Philipstown (later Daingean).\n\n\nCommerce and revenue\nThe weather during the years of Mary's reign was consistently wet The persistent rain and flooding led to famine [152] Another problem was the decline of the Antwerp cloth trade [153] Despite Mary's marriage to Philip, England did not benefit from Spain's enormously lucrative trade with the New World [154] The mercantilist Spanish guarded their trade routes jealously, and Mary could not condone English smuggling or piracy against her husband [155] In an attempt to increase trade and rescue the English economy, Mary's counsellors continued Northumberland's policy of seeking out new commercial opportunities She granted a royal charter to the Muscovy Company under governor Sebastian Cabot, [156] and commissioned a world atlas from Diogo Homem [157] Adventurers such as John Lok and William Towerson sailed south in an attempt to develop links with the coast of Africa [158]\n\n\nDeath\nAfter Philip's visit in 1557, Mary again thought she was pregnant, with a baby due in March 1558 [162] She decreed in her will that her husband would be the regent during the minority of their child [163] But no child was born, and Mary was forced to accept that her half-sister Elizabeth would be her lawful successor [164]\n\n\nLegacy\nJohn White, Bishop of Winchester, praised Mary at her funeral service: \"She was a king's daughter; she was a king's sister; she was a king's wife She was a queen, and by the same title a king also.\" [169] She was the first woman to successfully claim the throne of England, despite competing claims and determined opposition, and enjoyed popular support and sympathy during the earliest parts of her reign, especially from the Roman Catholics of England [170]\n\n\nTitles, style, and arms\nWhen Mary ascended the throne, she was proclaimed under the same official style as Henry VIII and Edward VI: \"Mary, by the Grace of God, Queen of England, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, and of the Church of England and of Ireland on Earth Supreme Head\" The title Supreme Head of the Church was repugnant to Mary's Catholicism, and she omitted it after Christmas 1553 [184]\n\n\nFamily tree\nBoth Mary and Philip were descended from John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster, a relationship that was used to portray Philip as an English king [187]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Mary I of England\n\nMary I of England, also known as Bloody

of 74,738 and an estimated global television audience of 1.013 billion [67] [66] [68] The weather at Santos Dumont Airport, 6.5 kilometres (4 mi) from the stadium, [c] was recorded as fair at the time of kick-off, becoming partly cloudy later in the evening [71] Germany won a free kick 3 minutes into the game, when Rojo fouled Müller around 25 yards (23 m) from the Argentina goal The free kick was hit straight at the wall, and Argentina launched a counterattack from the rebound Pablo Zabaleta ran with the ball down the right before passing to Higuaín on the edge of the penalty area He took a shot from a narrow angle, but the ball went wide of Neuer's left-hand goalpost On 9 minutes, Messi outpaced Hummels on the Argentina right and ran into the penalty area He attempted to find Ezequiel Lavezzi from the byline but Schweinsteiger reached it first and cleared [72] Germany had considerably more of the early possession, but a German defensive error on 20 minutes gave Argentina what Jerry Hinnen of CBS Sports called \"the best opportunity for either side\" thus far Kroos miscued a header, which left Higuaín one-on-one with Neuer, but the latter's shot from the edge of the penalty area went wide of the goal [73] On 23 minutes, Klose had a chance to score when the ball reached him following a cross by Philipp Lahm, but Zabaleta dispossessed him before he could shoot [72]\n\n\nSecond half\nArgentina began the second half with Agüero on the field in place of Lavezzi Higuaín had a shot in the first minute of the half after running down the right wing, but it went wide of Neuer's goal Messi then had an opportunity to score when he was one-on-one with the goalkeeper a minute later, but his low shot on goal also went wide Argentina had more possession than Germany in the opening 10 minutes of the half, and they had another chance on 50 minutes when Higuaín received a ball just inside the penalty area; he missed the ball with his attempted shot In the 56th minute, Neuer took down Higuaín in the penalty area, but no penalty was given, despite Argentine commentators believing it should be given No card was given either Klose had Germany's first shot on goal of the second half on 59 minutes but his shot lacked power and was caught by Romero Argentina had an opportunity to score through a Martín Demichelis header four minutes later, but Klose intercepted to send it behind Shortly afterwards, Javier Mascherano brought down Klose after losing the ball to him, and was booked His team-mate Agüero was also booked a minute later for a foul on Schweinsteiger Midway through the second half, The Guardian's Scott Murray commented that the first half had been \"goalless and brilliant\", but the second was \"goalless and .. well, not so much\", although he noted that it remained an open game [72]\n\n\nExtra time\nEarly in the first half of extra time, Schürrle received a pass in front of goal from Götze, but his close-range shot was stopped by Romero [72] This was followed by a break upfield by Messi and Agüero with only two defenders covering, but Boateng was able to intercept and clear the danger Five minutes later, a lob by Rodrigo Palacio over Neuer went just wide after the forward jumped on a mistake by Hummels in the German penalty area [78] At the halfway point in extra time, Murray wrote that Argentina were \"offering very little up front\" and speculated that many of the players might be \"thinking about penalties already\" [72] Alan Tyers of The Daily Telegraph noted that Messi did not \"look quite the ticket\" and that he had not been playing well since half time [78] In the second half of extra time, Germany broke the deadlock when Götze scored in the 113th minute Schürrle raced past two defenders on the left before crossing into the penalty area, where Götze controlled the ball on his chest and then volleyed left-footed into the net [79] Müller had a chance to double Germany's lead shortly afterward when he dribbled past two defenders, but his shot across the net was too wide Late in extra time, Messi had an opportunity to equalise from a free kick within goal-scoring distance, but his attempt flew high over the crossbar [80] That proved to be the last action of the game as the final whistle was blown, confirming Germany's 1–0 victory [72]\n\n\nDetails\nMan of the Match:\nMario Götze (Germany)\n\n\nPost-match\nGermany's victory marked the first World Cup win by a European team in the Americas, as well as the third successive European triumph after Italy and Spain's wins in 2006 and 2010 [2] [82] President Rousseff of Brazil delivered the trophy to German captain Philipp Lahm during the awards ceremony on the stands [83] [84] Alongside her during the trophy handover was FIFA president Sepp Blatter [85] [86] As Lahm raised the trophy, the outro of the tournament's official song \"We Are One (Ole Ola)\" was played [87] The goalscorer Götze was named as the official man of the match for the final, despite playing only the last two minutes of normal time and thirty minutes of extra time Messi was awarded the Golden Ball, FIFA's award for whom they considered the tournament's best player, and Neuer was given the Golden Glove for best goalkeeper [88]\n\n\nSee also\n Media related to Final of the 2014 FIFA World Cup at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nFootnotes\n Media

from the edge of the penalty area went wide of the goal [73] On 23 minutes, Klose had a chance to score when the ball reached him following a cross by Philipp Lahm, but Zabaleta dispossessed him before he could shoot [72]\n\n\nSecond half\nArgentina began the second half with Agüero on the field in place of Lavezzi Higuaín had a shot in the first minute of the half after running down the right wing, but it went wide of Neuer's goal Messi then had an opportunity to score when he was one-on-one with the goalkeeper a minute later, but his low shot on goal also went wide Argentina had more possession than Germany in the opening 10 minutes of the half, and they had another chance on 50 minutes when Higuaín received a ball just inside the penalty area; he missed the ball with his attempted shot In the 56th minute, Neuer took down Higuaín in the penalty area, but no penalty was given, despite Argentine commentators believing it should be given No card was given either Klose had Germany's first shot on goal of the second half on 59 minutes but his shot lacked power and was caught by Romero Argentina had an opportunity to score through a Martín Demichelis header four minutes later, but Klose intercepted to send it behind Shortly afterwards, Javier Mascherano brought down Klose after losing the ball to him, and was booked His team-mate Agüero was also booked a minute later for a foul on Schweinsteiger Midway through the second half, The Guardian's Scott Murray commented that the first half had been \"goalless and brilliant\", but the second was \"goalless and .. well, not so much\", although he noted that it remained an open game [72]\n\n\nExtra time\nEarly in the first half of extra time, Schürrle received a pass in front of goal from Götze, but his close-range shot was stopped by Romero [72] This was followed by a break upfield by Messi and Agüero with only two defenders covering, but Boateng was able to intercept and clear the danger Five minutes later, a lob by Rodrigo Palacio over Neuer went just wide after the forward jumped on a mistake by Hummels in the German penalty area [78] At the halfway point in extra time, Murray wrote that Argentina were \"offering very little up front\" and speculated that many of the players might be \"thinking about penalties already\" [72] Alan Tyers of The Daily Telegraph noted that Messi did not \"look quite the ticket\" and that he had not been playing well since half time [78] In the second half of extra time, Germany broke the deadlock when Götze scored in the 113th minute Schürrle raced past two defenders on the left before crossing into the penalty area, where Götze controlled the ball on his chest and then volleyed left-footed into the net [79] Müller had a chance to double Germany's lead shortly afterward when he dribbled past two defenders, but his shot across the net was too wide Late in extra time, Messi had an opportunity to equalise from a free kick within goal-scoring distance, but his attempt flew high over the crossbar [80] That proved to be the last action of the game as the final whistle was blown, confirming Germany's 1–0 victory [72]\n\n\nDetails\nMan of the Match:\nMario Götze (Germany)\n\n\nPost-match\nGermany's victory marked the first World Cup win by a European team in the Americas, as well as the third successive European triumph after Italy and Spain's wins in 2006 and 2010 [2] [82] President Rousseff of Brazil delivered the trophy to German captain Philipp Lahm during the awards ceremony on the stands [83] [84] Alongside her during the trophy handover was FIFA president Sepp Blatter [85] [86] As Lahm raised the trophy, the outro of the tournament's official song \"We Are One (Ole Ola)\" was played [87] The goalscorer Götze was named as the official man of the match for the final, despite playing only the last two minutes of normal time and thirty minutes of extra time Messi was awarded the Golden Ball, FIFA's award for whom they considered the tournament's best player, and Neuer was given the Golden Glove for best goalkeeper [88]\n\n\nSee also\n Media related to Final of the 2014 FIFA World Cup at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nFootnotes\n Media

I'm sure we wouldn't have made the same choice And then I started paying attention to her and watching her and looking at her and it was just unbelievable Frankly, I think they did a better job than I could have because I don't know that I would have scoured the earth as hard to find her .. They were looking for all the same things I would have looked for—all the values that Wonder Woman stands for exuding from someone in an honest way and boy did they find it .. She shares every quality with Wonder Woman and that's no joke It's one of those rare things You need someone who can appear to be Wonder Woman on screen .. Every once in a while, there's superhero casting that transcends, because that person is so authentic to the character that it becomes identified with them, like Lynda Carter or Christopher Reeve.\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography on the film began on November 21, 2015, [125] [126] under the working title Nightingale [127] [128] Among the film sets were Lower Halstow, Kent, [129] and

the Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL.\n\n\nMarketing\nThe success of the superhero television series Supergirl informed the marketing and promotion strategy used for Wonder Woman [155] According to Time Warner chief marketing officer Kristen O'Hara, they wanted to approach the Wonder Woman marketing campaign in a light manner, similar to how they did with Supergirl O'Hara elaborated that the modest campaign route they took for Supergirl aided in establishing a large central fanbase among women well in advance of the series, which reportedly generated 5 million female superhero fans in one week [155] They were then able to model over time and grow that audience leading up to the 15-months-later release of Wonder Woman [155] Though neither the film nor the series are aimed exclusively at women, the latter's campaign gave them their first opportunity to begin collecting data about female superhero fans [155] In May 2017, a promo for Wonder Woman was released during the season finale of Supergirl, featuring a remix of the song \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\" and Supergirl (Melissa Benoist) wearing Wonder Woman's boots [156]

possible director [69] In 1999 the project became attached to Jon Cohen, who adapted Wonder Woman for producer Joel Silver, with the hope that Sandra Bullock would star [70] By 2001, Todd Alcott was hired to write the screenplay, with Silver Pictures backing the project [71] At that time, Mariah Carey and Catherine Zeta-Jones were also rumored to be possible candidates for the role of Wonder Woman [72] Leonard Goldberg focused on Bullock [73] who said that she was approached for the role Lucy Lawless, the star of Xena: Warrior Princess, was also under consideration, though she stated that she would have been more interested if Wonder Woman was portrayed as a \"flawed hero\" [74] The screenplay went through various drafts written by Alcott, Cohen, Becky Johnston and Philip Levens, [75] and by August 2003, Levens had been replaced by screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis [76]\n\n\nDevelopment\nIn 2010, Warner Bros stated that a Wonder Woman film was in development, along with films based on DC Comics superheroes the Flash and Aquaman [87] Both Wonder Woman and Aquaman were still under consideration for solo film subjects as of June 2013 [88] DC Entertainment president Diane Nelson said Wonder Woman \"has been, since I started, one of the top three priorities for DC and for Warner Bros We are still trying right now, but she's tricky.\" [89] On October 5, 2013, WB chairman and CEO Kevin Tsujihara said he wanted to get Wonder Woman in a film or on TV [90] Shortly afterward, Paul Feig said he had pitched the studio an idea for Wonder Woman as an action-comedy film [91] [92] The studio then began to search for female directors to direct the film [93] While Michelle MacLaren was the studio's initial choice to direct (and while she initially indicated interest), [94] [95] [96] she eventually left the project due to creative differences [97]\n\n\nCasting\nI remember when I read in the news that Wonder Woman had been cast and my heart sank .. I'm sure we wouldn't have made the same choice And then I started paying attention to her and watching her and looking at her and it was just unbelievable Frankly, I think they did a better job than I could have because I don't know that I would have scoured the earth as hard to find her .. They were looking for all the same things I would have looked for—all the values that Wonder Woman stands for exuding from someone in an honest way and boy did they find it .. She shares every quality with Wonder Woman and that's no joke It's one of those rare things You need someone who can appear to be Wonder Woman on screen .. Every once in a while, there's superhero casting that transcends, because that person is so authentic to the character that it becomes identified with them, like Lynda Carter or Christopher Reeve.\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography on the film began on November 21, 2015, [125] [126] under the working title Nightingale [127] [128] Among the film sets were Lower Halstow, Kent, [129] and Australia House [130] in England  and the Sassi di Matera, [131] Castel del Monte [131] and Camerota [132] in Southern Italy Matthew Jensen was the director of photography, [133] filming in the United Kingdom, France and Italy [134] Production in London concluded on March 13, 2016 [135] Hatfield House in Hertfordshire, England was also used as a filming location [136] [137]\n\n\nMusic\nOn November 3, 2016, Rupert Gregson-Williams was hired to write and compose the film's music [147] [148] He was joined by Evan Jolly, Tom Howe, [149] Paul Mounsey, [150] and Andrew Kawczynski, [151] who provided additional music The soundtrack was released on CD, digital and vinyl the same day as the film [152] Australian musician Sia sang a song for the film, titled \"To Be Human\", featuring English musician Labrinth Written by Florence Welch and Rick Nowels, the track is also featured on the soundtrack [153] The soundtrack also features samples from Wonder Woman's theme \"Is She with You\" from the Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL.\n\n\nMarketing\nThe success of the superhero television series Supergirl informed the marketing and promotion strategy used for Wonder Woman [155] According to Time Warner chief marketing officer Kristen O'Hara, they wanted to approach the Wonder Woman marketing campaign in a light manner, similar to how they did with Supergirl O'Hara elaborated that the modest campaign route they took for Supergirl aided in establishing a large central fanbase among women well in advance of the series, which reportedly generated 5 million female superhero fans in one week [155] They were then able to model over time and grow that audience leading up to the 15-months-later release of Wonder Woman [155] Though neither the film nor the series are aimed exclusively at women, the latter's campaign gave them their first opportunity to begin collecting data about female superhero fans [155] In May 2017, a promo for Wonder Woman was released during the season finale of Supergirl, featuring a remix of the song \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\" and Supergirl (Melissa Benoist) wearing Wonder Woman's boots [156] The promo included an appearance by Lynda Carter, star of the 1970s Wonder Woman, who plays the American president on Supergirl [156]\n\n\nRelease\nWonder Woman had its world premiere on May 25, 2017,

[173]\n\n\nControversies\nOn May 31, Wonder Woman was banned in Lebanon after the Campaign to Boycott Supporters of Israel asked the Lebanese government's Ministry of Economy and Trade to block the film because its star, Gal Gadot, is a former Israel Defense Forces soldier [174] [175] The Lebanese government did not ban Gadot's Fast & Furious films which did screen in Lebanon [176] [177] On June 6, Variety reported that Algiers, the capital of Algeria, pulled the film from the \"Nuits du Cinéma\" film festival [178] On June 7, Variety also reported that a Tunisian court suspended the theatrical release of Wonder Woman after a lawsuit brought by the Al-Chaab party and the Tunisian Association of Young Lawyers to have the film blocked due to Gadot's military service and public comments she made in support of the Israeli military during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict between her native Israel and the Palestinian enclave of the Gaza Strip [179] [180] Jordan was reportedly also considering a ban of the film and suspended screenings pending a decision, [181] but on June 11, it was reported that the government decided not to do so, as there was no legal precedent for it [182] On June 30, Qatar issued a ban on the film [183]\n\n\nArab countries ban\nOn May 31, Wonder Woman was banned in Lebanon after the Campaign to Boycott Supporters of Israel asked the Lebanese

in Austin, Texas Opponents of the gender-restricted screening stated on Facebook that such screenings were discriminatory against men [184] [185] [186] An Albany Law School professor initiated a complaint with Austin's Equal Employment and Fair Housing Office claiming discrimination against male prospective customers and employees of the theater [187] The chain responded with an online statement saying the event \"may have created confusion—we want everybody to see this film\" and announced a similar event at their Brooklyn location Tickets sold out in less than an hour, prompting the chain to schedule additional screenings [184] On July 18, Alamo Drafthouse proposed settlement offers of a Wonder Woman DVD to the complaints, stating \"Respondent did not realize that advertising a 'women's only' screening was a violation of discrimination laws.\" [188]\n\n\nReception\nWonder Woman grossed $412.6 million in the United States and Canada and $409.3 million in other territories

[217]\n\n\nCritical response\nWonder Woman received positive response from critics, with some calling it the DC Extended Universe (DCEU)'s best film, praising Jenkins's direction and the acting, chemistry between Gadot and Pine, musical score and action sequences [9] [221] On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 93% based on 480 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10 It is the eighth best reviewed live-action superhero film on Rotten Tomatoes and the  # 1 highest rated live-action superhero film set in the DCEU [222] [a] On Metacritic, the film

feminist and others thinking it's not feminist enough\" [288] Kyle Killian found an inherent contradiction in the construction of Wonder Woman as \"a warrior\" who, she states, is highly sexualized Killian suggests these elements \"should not be the focus of a kickass heroine—her beauty, bone structure and sexiness—if she is to be a feminist icon\" [289] Theresa Harold concurred, comparing Wonder Woman to Katniss Everdeen (The Hunger Games), who \"didn't have to wear a teenager's wet dream of a costume to fight in\" [290] Christina Cauterucci felt Wonder Woman's ability to be considered a \"feminist antidote\" was undermined by her \"sex appeal\" [291] Other critics refer to the construction of Wonder Woman in the film as \"an implausible post-feminist hero\" [292]

the North Sentinel Island reef, crewmen several days later noticed that some men carrying spears and arrows were building boats on the beach  The captain of Primrose radioed for an urgent drop of firearms so his crew could defend themselves They did not receive any because a large storm stopped other ships from reaching them, but the heavy seas also prevented the islanders from approaching the ship  A week later, the crewmen were rescued by a helicopter under contract to the Indian Oil And Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) [22]\n\n\nFirst peaceful contact\nThe first peaceful contact with the Sentinelese was made by Triloknath Pandit, a director of the Anthropological Survey of India (AnSI), and his colleagues on 4 January 1991 [21]: 289  [23] Although Pandit and his colleagues were able to make repeated friendly contact, dropping coconuts and other gifts to the Sentinelese, no progress was made in understanding the Sentinelese language, and the Sentinelese repeatedly warned them off if they stayed too long Indian visits to the island ceased in 1997 [2]\n\n\nIndian Ocean earthquake and later hostile contact\nThe Sentinelese survived the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and its after-effects, including the tsunami and the uplifting of the island Three days after the earthquake, an Indian government helicopter observed several islanders, who shot arrows and threw spears and stones at the helicopter [2] [19]: 362–363  [24] Although the tsunami disturbed the tribal fishing grounds, the Sentinelese appear to have adapted [25]\n\n\nGeography\nNorth Sentinel lies 36 km (22 mi) west of the village of Wandoor in South Andaman Island, [2] 50 km (31 mi) west of Port Blair, and 59.6 km (37.0 mi) north of its counterpart South Sentinel Island It has an area of about 59.67 km2 (23.04 sq mi) and a roughly square outline [3]\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nThe island is largely covered in tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest Due to the lack of surveys, the exact composition of the terrestrial flora and fauna remains unknown In his 1880 expedition to the island, Maurice Vidal Portman reported an open, \"park-like\" jungle with numerous groves of bulletwood (Manilkara littoralis) trees, as well as huge, buttressed specimens of Malabar silk-cotton tree (Bombax ceiba) [33] Indian boar (Sus scrofa cristatus) are apparently found on the island and a major food source for the Sentinelese, with reports by Portman referring to a \"huge heap\" of pig skulls near a Sentinelese village [34] The IUCN Red List lists North Sentinel as being an important habitat for coconut crabs (Birgus latro), which have been otherwise extirpated from most of the other Andaman Islands except from South Sentinel and Little Andaman [35] North Sentinel Island, along with South Sentinel, is also considered a globally Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International, as despite the lack of surveys, the pristine habitat likely supports a diversity of birdlife [36]\n\n\nDemographics\nNorth Sentinel Island is inhabited by the Sentinelese, indigenous people who defend their voluntary isolation by force Their population was estimated to be between 50 and 400 people in a 2012 report [2] India's 2011 census indicates 15 residents [37] in 10 households, but that too was merely an estimate, described as a \"wild guess\" by The Times of India [9]\n\n\nPolitical status\nThe Andaman and Nicobar (Protection of Aboriginal Tribes) Regulation, 1956 provides protection to the Sentinelese and other native tribes in the region [39] The Andaman and Nicobar Administration stated in 2005 that they have no intention to interfere with the lifestyle or habitat of the Sentinelese and are not interested in pursuing any further contact with them or governing the island [40] Although North Sentinel Island is not legally an autonomous administrative division of India, scholars have referred to it and its people as effectively autonomous, [41] [42] or de-facto sovereign [41] [43]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**North Sentinel Island**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nNorth Sentinel Island is a small island located in the Bay of Bengal, part of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands union territory of India.

Indian visits to the island ceased in 1997.\n\n**Indian Ocean Earthquake and Later Hostile Contact**\n\nThe Sentinelese survived the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and its after-effects, including the tsunami and the uplifting of the island. Three days after the earthquake, an Indian government helicopter observed several islanders, who shot arrows and threw spears and stones at the helicopter.\n\n**Geography**\n\nNorth Sentinel Island lies 36 km west of the village of Wandoor in South Andaman Island, 50 km west of Port Blair, and 59.6 km north of its counterpart South Sentinel Island. It has an area of about 59.67 km² and a roughly square outline.\n\n**Flora and Fauna**\n\nThe island is largely covered in tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest. Due to the lack of surveys, the exact composition of the terrestrial flora and fauna remains unknown. In his 1880 expedition to the island, Maurice Vidal Portman reported an open, \"park-like\" jungle with numerous groves of bulletwood (Manilkara littoralis) trees, as well as huge, buttressed specimens of Malabar silk-cotton tree (Bombax ceiba). Indian boar (Sus scrofa cristatus) are apparently found on the island and a major food source for the Sentinelese, with reports by Portman referring to a \"huge heap\" of pig skulls near a Sentinelese village. The IUCN Red List lists North Sentinel as being an important habitat for coconut crabs (Birgus latro), which have been otherwise extirpated from most of the other Andaman Islands except from South Sentinel and Little Andaman.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nNorth Sentinel Island is inhabited by the Sentinelese, indigenous people who defend their voluntary isolation by force. Their population was estimated to be between 50 and 400 people in a 2012 report. India's 2011 census indicates 15 residents in 10 households, but that too was merely an estimate, described as a \"wild guess\" by The Times of India.\n\n**Political Status**\n\nThe Andaman and Nicobar (Protection of Aboriginal Tribes) Regulation, 1956 provides protection to the Sentinelese and other native tribes in the region. The Andaman and Nicobar Administration stated in 2005 that they have no intention to interfere with the lifestyle or habitat of the Sentinelese and are not interested in pursuing any further contact with them or governing the island.

amongst the Sentinelese However, Onges brought to North Sentinel Island by the British during the 19th century could not understand the language spoken by the North Sentinelese; as such, a significant period of separation is likely [2] [19]: 362–363 \n\n\nBritish visits\nBritish surveyor John Ritchie observed \"a multitude of lights\" from an East India Company hydrographic survey vessel, the

Maurice Vidal Portman, a government administrator who hoped to research the natives and their customs, landed on North Sentinel Island in January 1880 The group found a network of pathways and several small, abandoned villages After several days, six Sentinelese, an elderly couple and four children, were taken to Port Blair The colonial officer in charge of the operation wrote that the entire group

the MV Primrose did so on 2 August 1981 After the Primrose grounded on the North Sentinel Island reef, crewmen several days later noticed that some men carrying spears and arrows were building boats on the beach  The captain of Primrose radioed for an urgent drop of firearms so his crew could defend themselves They did not receive any because a large storm stopped other ships from reaching them, but the heavy seas also prevented the islanders from approaching the ship  A week later, the crewmen were rescued by a helicopter under contract to the Indian Oil And Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC)

The new system reduced the odds of winning the draft lottery for the four lowest finishing teams in the league, while increasing the odds for the other non-playoff teams. As a result of this change, the league reduced the number of lottery drawings before the 2021-22 season, resulting in two lotteries being held for this draft.\n\nThe first drawing was held on June 30, 2022, and the winning team was awarded the first overall selection. The team that won the first drawing would move up to the first selection if they were seeded 1-11, while teams seeded 12-16 would move up ten spots. If the team seeded 12 won the first draw, they would secure the second overall pick, and the team seeded first would secure the first overall pick by default.\n\nThe second drawing was held on July 7, 2022, and the 15 remaining teams were re-seeded. The teams seeded 1-12 could move up to the second overall pick if it was still available after the first draw, while teams seeded 13-15 could move up a maximum of ten spots. If the second overall pick was not available to the winner of the second draw, they would be awarded the next highest available selection.\n\nAfter the two draws were complete, all remaining draft picks were assigned to the remaining teams in inverse order of regular season finish.\n\n**Top Prospects**\n\nThe top prospects in the 2022 NHL entry draft were:\n\n1.

The film was unsuccessful because Chan was not accustomed to Lee's martial arts style Despite the film's failure, Lo Wei continued producing films with similar themes, but with little improvement at the box office [37]\n\n\n1980–1987: Commercial success in the action comedy genre\nWillie Chan became Jackie's personal manager and firm friend, and remained so for over 30 years He was instrumental in launching Chan's international career, beginning with his first forays into the American film industry in the 1980s His first Hollywood film was The Big Brawl in 1980 [41] [42] Chan then played a minor role in the 1981 film The Cannonball Run, which grossed over US$100 million worldwide [43] Despite being largely ignored by North American audiences in favour of established American actors such as Burt Reynolds, Chan was impressed by the outtakes shown at the closing credits, inspiring him to include the same device in his future films [citation needed]\n\n\n1988–1998: Acclaimed film sequels and Hollywood breakthrough\nIn 1988, Chan starred alongside Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao for the last time to date in the film Dragons Forever Hung co-directed with Corey Yuen, and the villain in the film was played by Yuen Wah, both of whom were fellow graduates of the China Drama Academy [citation needed]\n\n\n1999–2007: Fame in Hollywood and dramatization\nIn 1998, Chan released his final film for Golden Harvest, Who Am I? After leaving Golden Harvest in 1999, he produced and starred alongside Shu Qi in Gorgeous, a romantic comedy that focused on personal relationships and featured only a few martial arts sequences [63] Although Chan had left Golden Harvest in 1999, the company continued to produce and distribute for two of his films, Gorgeous (1999) and The Accidental Spy (2001) Chan then helped create a PlayStation game in 2000 called Jackie Chan Stuntmaster, to which he lent his voice and performed the motion capture [64] He continued his Hollywood success in 2000 when he teamed up with Owen Wilson in the Western action comedy Shanghai Noon A sequel, Shanghai Knights followed in 2003 and also featured his first on-screen fight scene with Donnie Yen [65] He reunited with Chris Tucker for Rush Hour 2 (2001), which was an even bigger success than the original, grossing $347 million worldwide [66] Chan experimented with the use of special effects and wirework for the fight scenes in his next two Hollywood films, The Tuxedo (2002) and The Medallion (2003), which were not as successful critically or commercially [67] In 2004, he teamed up with Steve Coogan in Around the World in 80 Days, loosely based on Jules Verne's novel of the same name In 2004, film scholar Andrew Willis stated that Chan was \"perhaps\" the \"most recognized star in the world\" [15]\n\n\n2008–present: New experiments and change in acting style\nFilming of The Forbidden Kingdom, Chan's first on-screen collaboration with fellow Chinese actor Jet Li, was completed on 24 August 2007 and the movie was released in April 2008 The movie featured heavy use of effects and wires [74] [75] Chan voiced Master Monkey in Kung Fu Panda (released in June 2008), appearing with Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, and Angelina Jolie [76] In addition, he has assisted Anthony Szeto in an advisory capacity for the writer-director's film Wushu, released on 1 May 2008 The film stars Sammo Hung and Wang Wenjie as father and son [77]\n\n\nOther works\nChan had vocal lessons while at the Peking Opera School in his childhood He began producing records professionally in the 1980s and has gone on to become a successful singer in Hong Kong and Asia He has released 20 albums since 1984 and has performed vocals in Cantonese, Mandarin, Japanese, Taiwanese and English He often sings the theme songs of his films, which play over the closing credits Chan's first musical recording was \"Kung Fu Fighting Man\", the theme song played over the closing credits of The Young Master (1980) [93] At least 10 of these recordings have been released on soundtrack albums for the films [94] [95] His Cantonese song \"Story of a Hero\" (英雄故事) (theme song of Police Story) was selected by the Royal Hong Kong Police and

Born on 7 April 1954 in British Hong Kong, Chan is one of the most successful and recognizable stars in the world, known for his incredible stunts, acrobatic fighting skills, and ability to perform complex physical feats in his films.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nChan was born in British Hong Kong as Chan Kong-sang, to Charles and Lee-Lee Chan, who were political refugees from the Chinese Civil War. His father, originally named Fang Daolong, briefly worked as a secret agent for Lieutenant General Dai Li, the chief spy in Kuomintang-ruled China. In fear of being arrested by the communist government, Chan's father fled to British Hong Kong in the 1940s and changed his surname from Fang to Chan. Chan was named after his father's surname, with his given name being a combination of his parents' surnames.\n\n**Film Career**\n\nChan began his film career at the age of five as a child actor. He appeared in small roles in films such as \"Big and Little Wong Tin Bar\" (1962) and \"Liang Shan Po and Chu Ying Tai\" (1964). Chan's breakthrough role came in 1976, when he was cast in the film \"New Fist of Fury,\" a remake of Bruce Lee's \"Fist of Fury.\" Chan's performance in the film led to his being offered a role in the film \"Snake in the Eagle's Shadow,\" which was released in 1978 and became a huge success.\n\n**1962–1975: Early Small Appearances**\n\nChan's early film career was marked by small appearances in films such as \"Big and Little Wong Tin Bar\" (1962) and \"Liang Shan Po and Chu Ying Tai\" (1964). These early films showcased Chan's ability to perform complex physical stunts and fight scenes, which would become a hallmark of his later career.\n\n**1976–1980: Start-Up Leading Roles**\n\nIn 1976, Chan received a telegram from Willie Chan, a film producer in the Hong Kong film industry, who had been impressed with Chan's stunt choreography work. Willie Chan offered Chan an acting role in a film directed by Lo Wei, which led to Chan's breakthrough role in the film \"New Fist of Fury.\" Chan's performance in the film led to his being offered a role in the film \"Snake in the Eagle's Shadow,\" which was released in 1978 and became a huge success.\n\n**1980–1987: Commercial Success in the Action Comedy Genre**\n\nWillie Chan became Chan's personal manager and firm friend, and remained so for over 30 years. He was instrumental in launching Chan's international career, beginning with his first forays into the American film industry in the 1980s. Chan's first Hollywood film was \"The Big Brawl\" in 1980, which was a commercial success and helped establish Chan as a leading actor in the action comedy genre.\n\n**1988–1998: Acclaimed Film Sequels and Hollywood Breakthrough**\n\nIn 1988, Chan starred alongside Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao in the film \"Dragons Forever,\" which was a commercial success and helped establish Chan as a leading actor in the action comedy genre. Chan's Hollywood breakthrough came in 1998, when he starred in the film \"Rush Hour,\" which was a critical and commercial success and helped establish Chan as a leading actor in Hollywood.\n\n**1999–2007: Fame in Hollywood and Dramatization**\n\nIn 1999, Chan released his final film for Golden Harvest, \"Who Am I?\" After leaving Golden Harvest in 1999, he produced and starred alongside Shu Qi in \"Gorgeous,\" a romantic comedy that focused on personal relationships and featured only a few martial arts sequences. Chan then helped create a PlayStation game in 2000 called \"Jackie Chan Stuntmaster,\" to which he lent his voice and performed the motion capture.\n\n**2008–present: New Experiments and Change in Acting Style**\n\nFilming of \"The Forbidden Kingdom,\" Chan's first on-screen collaboration with fellow Chinese actor Jet Li, was completed on 24 August 2007 and the movie was released in April 2008. The movie featured heavy use of effects and wires. Chan voiced Master Monkey in \"Kung Fu Panda\" (released in June 2008), appearing with Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, and Angelina Jolie.\n\n**Other Works**\n\nChan had vocal lessons while at the Peking Opera School in his childhood. He began producing records professionally in the 1980s and has gone on to become a successful singer in Hong Kong and Asia. He has released 20 albums since 1984 and has performed vocals in Cantonese, Mandarin, Japanese, Taiwanese, and English.\n\n**Academia**\n\nChan received his honorary Doctorate of Social Science degree in 1996 from the Hong Kong Baptist University.

{"title": "2024_raid_on_the_Mexican_embassy_in_Ecuador", "content": "\nBackground\nIn December 2023, former Ecuadorian vice president Jorge Glas, who had served as vice president under presidents Rafael Correa and Lenín Moreno, entered the Mexican embassy in Quito to request asylum, alleging political persecution [7] The former vice president had been sentenced in December 2017 to serve eight years in prison for two sentences: one of six years for illicit association and another of eight years for bribery [8] In November 2022, Glas was released but could not leave the country during the remainder of his sentences The attorney general's office then said it was insisting on charging Glas with respect to the case involving public funds collected to aid the reconstruction of Manabí Province after a 2016 earthquake [9] On 17 December, Glas entered the Mexican embassy in Quito and requested political asylum, alleging he was being persecuted politically in Ecuador [10]\n\n\nRaid\nAt around 22:00 on 5 April, an elite detachment of the National Police of Ecuador forced their way into the embassy and took Glas into custody [18] They possessed a battering ram At least one agent climbed the walls [19] They took Glas to the attorney general's office, then to an airport for a flight to Guayaquil, with plans to transfer him to a maximum security facility Glas's attorney said that police kicked his client multiple times while Glas was resisting arrest, and dragged him out of the embassy Mexican foreign minister Alicia Bárcena said that some of their diplomats were injured during the raid [20] Police also pointed a gun at the embassy's acting head, Roberto Canseco, when he tried to block their path [21]\n\n\nGovernment positions\nCommenting on the raid, President Noboa said he made \"exceptional decisions to protect national security, the rule of law and the dignity of a population that rejects any type of impunity for criminals, corrupt people or narco-terrorists\", and that he would \"not allow sentenced criminals involved in very serious crimes to be given asylum\", arguing that such actions were against the Vienna Convention and other international agreements [23] Noboa later said that wished to resolve the diplomatic issue with Mexico, but added that \"justice is not negotiated\" and that \"we will never protect criminals who have harmed Mexicans\" [24] Foreign minister Gabriela Sommerfeld defended the raid, saying that the decision was made by Noboa after the government had determined an \"imminent flight risk\" on the part of Glas and after it had exhausted all possibilities for diplomatic dialogue with Mexico She added that it was not \"legal to grant asylum to people convicted of common crimes and by competent courts\" [20]\n\n\nEcuador\nCommenting on the raid, President Noboa said he made \"exceptional decisions to protect national security, the rule of law and the dignity of a population that rejects any type of

of common crimes and by competent courts\" [20]\n\n\nMexico\nImmediately following the raid, Roberto Canseco, head of the embassy's consular section and acting head of mission, called the incident \"crazy\" and expressed concern over Glas's life [20] After the news spread of the raid, on the same day, President López Obrador announced on X (Twitter) the severing of all diplomatic relations with Ecuador Mexico also announced plans to take Ecuador to the International Court of Justice for violations of international law [25] It also said there were no plans to expel Ecuadorean diplomats from Mexico City [24]\n\n\nAftermath\nGlas's attorney, Sonia Vera, said that she and other members of his defense team were not allowed to speak with Glas while he was at the prosecutor's office in Guayaquil, and said that they were filing a petition for habeas corpus Vera also expressed concern that \"something could happen\" to Glas in custody As Glas left the prosecutor's office, people gathered outside chanted \"strength\" [20]\n\n\nMexico's suit against Ecuador in the ICJ\nSix days after the raid of its embassy, Mexico filed an application instituting proceedings against Ecuador at

Ecuador. The incident involved the Ecuadorian government's forced entry into the embassy, the arrest of former Ecuadorian vice president Jorge Glas, and the subsequent severing of diplomatic relations between Ecuador and Mexico.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe raid on the Mexican embassy was a contentious and high-profile incident that sparked widespread outrage and condemnation across Latin America and the international community. The event highlighted the complex and often tense relationship between Ecuador and Mexico, as well as the delicate balance of power within the region.\n\n**Background**\n\nIn December 2023, former Ecuadorian vice president Jorge Glas, who had served as vice president under presidents Rafael Correa and Lenín Moreno, entered the Mexican embassy in Quito to request asylum, alleging political persecution. Glas had been sentenced in December 2017 to serve eight years in prison for two crimes: one of six years for illicit association and another of eight years for bribery. In November 2022, Glas was released but could not leave the country during the remainder of his sentences. The attorney general's office then said it was insisting on charging Glas with respect to the case involving public funds collected to aid the reconstruction of Manabí Province after a 2016 earthquake. On December 17, Glas entered the Mexican embassy in Quito and requested political asylum, alleging he was being persecuted politically in Ecuador.\n\n**Raid**\n\nAt around 22:00 on April 5, an elite detachment of the National Police of Ecuador forced their way into the embassy and took Glas into custody. They possessed a battering ram, and at least one agent climbed the walls. The police took Glas to the attorney general's office, then to an airport for a flight to Guayaquil, with plans to transfer him to a maximum-security facility. Glas's attorney said that police kicked his client multiple times while Glas was resisting arrest, and dragged him out of the embassy. Mexican foreign minister Alicia Bárcena said that some of their diplomats were injured during the raid. Police also pointed a gun at the embassy's acting head, Roberto Canseco, when he tried to block their path.\n\n**Government Positions**\n\nCommenting on the raid, President Noboa said he made \"exceptional decisions to protect national security, the rule of law, and the dignity of a population that rejects any type of impunity for criminals, corrupt people, or narco-terrorists.\" He added that he would \"not allow sentenced criminals involved in very serious crimes to be given asylum,\" arguing that such actions were against the Vienna Convention and other international agreements. Noboa later said that wished to resolve the diplomatic issue with Mexico, but added that \"justice is not negotiated\" and that \"we will never protect criminals who have harmed Mexicans.\" Foreign minister Gabriela Sommerfeld defended the raid, saying that the decision was made by Noboa after the government had determined an \"imminent flight risk\" on the part of Glas and after it had exhausted all possibilities for diplomatic dialogue with Mexico. She added that it was not \"legal to grant asylum to people convicted of common crimes and by competent courts.\"\n\n**Ecuador**\n\nCommenting on the raid, President Noboa said he made \"exceptional decisions to protect national security, the rule of law, and the dignity of a population that rejects any type of impunity for criminals, corrupt people, or narco-terrorists.\" He added that he would \"not allow sentenced criminals involved in very serious crimes to be given asylum,\" arguing that such actions were against the Vienna Convention and other international agreements.

She added that it was not \"legal to grant asylum to people convicted of common crimes and by competent courts.\"\n\n**Mexico**\n\nImmediately following the raid, Roberto Canseco, head of the embassy's consular section and acting head of mission, called the incident \"crazy\" and expressed concern over Glas's life. After the news spread of the raid, on the same day, President López Obrador announced on X (Twitter) the severing of all diplomatic relations with Ecuador. Mexico also announced plans to take Ecuador to the International Court of Justice for violations of international law. It also said there were no plans to expel Ecuadorean diplomats from Mexico City.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nGlas's attorney, Sonia Vera, said that she and other members of his defense team were not allowed to speak with Glas while he was at the prosecutor's office in Guayaquil. She added that they were filing a petition for habeas corpus. Vera also expressed concern that \"something could happen\" to Glas in custody. As Glas left the prosecutor's office, people gathered outside chanted \"strength.\"\n\n**Mexico's Suit Against Ecuador in the ICJ**\n\nSix days after the raid of its embassy, Mexico filed an application instituting proceedings against Ecuador at the International Court of Justice. In the application, Mexico requested provisional measures to protect the integrity of the abandoned embassy and that Ecuador's membership in the United Nations be suspended until a public apology is given. The suit is formally captioned Embassy of Mexico in Quito (Mexico v Ecuador). On April 29, 2024, Ecuador filed a separate suit in the ICJ, accusing Mexico of illegally granting asylum to Glas.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe embassy raid provoked what The Guardian newspaper described

He has also been described as having an \"extraordinary\" cardiovascular system.\n\n**Awards and honours**\n\nPeaty received the FINA award for Best Male Swimming Performance of 2015 after he won three gold medals at the World Championships in Kazan. In 2016, he was also honoured by FINA for the best male Olympic swimming performance of the year award after breaking the 100m breaststroke world record at the 2016 Olympics. Peaty has won the Ligue Européenne de Natation (LEN) Award for best male swimmer for three times in four years for his performances in 2016, 2017, and 2019. He was the recipient of the award again in 2021.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Adam_Peaty\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nAdam George Peaty was born on 28 December 1994 in Uttoxeter, Staffordshire to Mark and Caroline Peaty, the youngest of four children [6] [7] He attended St Josephs Catholic Primary School in Uttoxeter, [8] Painsley Catholic College in Cheadle and Derby College [9] [10] As a young boy, he developed an acute fear of water and was averse to being put in the bath after his brothers told him that sharks may come up through the plughole At four years of age Peaty and his friend both went on their first swimming lesson together It was at this swimming lesson where he lost the fear [6] [11] [12] [13]\n\n\nCareer\n\"I can't believe it, it's a dream, I've studied Cameron  [van der Burgh] for a while–he was my idol, and now he's my rival I knew I would go off quickly, but I caught him It is a major stepping-stone for me, and for swimming in the country.\"\n\n\n2014\nAt the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, Scotland, Peaty entered four events: the 50 metre breaststroke, the 100 metre breaststroke, the 200 metre breaststroke, and the 4 × 100 metre medley relay [9] In the 50 metre breaststroke, Peaty qualified fastest out of the heats, setting a new Commonwealth Games record, before winning his semi-final to qualify second fastest for the final He eventually finished second in the final with a time of 26.78\", 0.02 seconds behind South African Cameron van der Burgh [26] In the 100 metre breaststroke, Peaty set new Commonwealth Games records in the heats, semi-finals and the final, posting a time of 58.94\" to win the gold, 0.34 seconds faster than van der Burgh, who finished second [27] Olympic champion and world record holder van der Burgh was the favourite to win, but Peaty managed a record time for a British man in the event [21] In the 200 metre breaststroke, Peaty finished in fourth place, 0.15 seconds off a medal position and 2.72 seconds behind first-placed Scotsman Ross Murdoch [28] Peaty also won gold in the 4 x 100 metre medley relay with his team of Chris Walker-Hebborn, Adam Barrett and Adam Brown [29]\n\n\n2015\nIn 2015, Peaty's rise continued, breaking the world record for 100 metre breaststroke at the British Championships and World Trials by almost half a second His time of 57.92 seconds made him the first man to go under 58 seconds for the event [30] He qualified for all three breaststroke events at the 2015 World Aquatic Championships At the 2015 World Championships, he became a World Champion for the first time [31]\n\n\n2016\n\nAt the 2016 European Championships held in London, Peaty retained both of his individual titles in the 50 metre breaststroke and the 100 metre breaststroke, comfortably winning all of his heat, semi final and final swims and sharing the podium with his teammate Ross Murdoch on both occasions He also retained both of his relay titles winning the 4 × 100 metre medley relay with Walker-Hebborn, Guy and Duncan Scott, and the mixed 4 × 100 metre medley relay with Walker-Hebborn, O'Connor and Halsall He did not enter the 200 metre breaststroke event and as of the Olympics held in 2021 [update] had never entered the event again at a major championship.\n\n2017\nAt the 2017 World Aquatics Championships, Peaty retained his 100 metre breaststroke title After easily winning his heat and semi-final races, he won in the final winning the race with a championship record of 57.47 seconds [41] Peaty also broke his own world record twice in the 50 metre breaststroke He recorded 26.10 seconds in the heats, and in the semi-final, he became the first man to break 26 seconds and won in 25.95 seconds [42] He successfully defended his 50-metre breaststroke title with another sub-26 time of 25.99 seconds in the final, completing another double at the World Championships with van der Burgh taking bronze [43] He won a further silver in the 4 × 100 metre medley relay at the World Championship, setting a new British record, with the same Olympic line-up of Walker-Hebborn, Guy and Scott, but missed out on a medal in the 4 x 100 metre mixed medley relay with Davies, Guy and O'Connor despite setting a new European record [44]\n\n\n2018\nAt the 2018 Commonwealth Games, Peaty defended his 100 metre breaststroke title, winning in a time of 58.84 seconds after setting a games record time in the semi-final of 58.59, beating his teammate James Wilby in to silver medal position and his old rival van der Burgh in to bronze [47] However, he finished second in the 50 metre breaststroke behind van der Burgh, the first time he had failed to win a 50-metre breaststroke race for 4 years since he lost to him at the 2014 Commonwealth Games [48] He also helped his England team win a silver medal in the 4 × 100 metre medley relay with Luke Greenbank, Guy and Proud [49]\n\n\n2019\nAt the 2019 World Aquatics Championships held in Gwangju, South Korea, Peaty broke his own world record in the semi-final of the 100 metre breaststroke with a time of 56.88\", and became the first man to break 57 seconds in the event, before anybody else had swum in under 58 seconds [57] He retained his 100-metre title in the final, after finishing first in front of his training partner James Wilby [58] He won the gold in the 50 metre breaststroke for the third time, completing the triple double at the World Championships [59] He also won a bronze in the 4 × 100 metre mixed medley relay with Davies, Guy and Anderson [60] Peaty made this his most successful world championships yet after winning his third gold in the 4 × 100 metre medley relay together with Greenbank, Guy and Scott, the first gold won by the British team in this event at the Championships He helped the team finish first in a European record time of 3 minutes, 28.10 seconds to beat the United States [61] [62]\n\n\n2020\nDue to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic both the 2020 Olympics and 2020 European Championships were postponed until 2021 On 15 November 2020, at the International Swimming League meet in Budapest, Peaty competed as part of the London Roar team He broke the world record for the short-course 100m breaststroke with a time of 55.49 seconds in the semi-final, which was his first ever world record in short course metres [65] He then beat his own world record time in the 100m breaststroke one week later, swimming 55.41 seconds in the final [66] He ended up winning 6 out his 15 individual breaststroke events during the 2020 ISL season, as well as all 3 of the skins races he competed in [67] In December, Peaty and three fellow 2019 individual world championship medal-winning team-mates were pre-selected for the postponed Tokyo Olympics [68]\n\n\n2021\nAt the 2021 British Swimming Olympic trials, Peaty won the 100m breaststroke title on the opening day of the championships at the London Aquatics Centre in a time of 57.39 seconds [69] [70] In May 2021, he won his fourth successive gold medals in both the 100m breaststroke and the 50m breaststroke at the European Championships [71] [72] He also won two further golds as part of the team in the mixed 4 × 100 metre medley and men's 4 × 100 m medley relays [73] [74]\n\n\n2022\nIn March 2022, Peaty signed a professional sponsorship deal with Speedo [80] Approximately two months later, he announced that due to a fractured foot that required him to rest for 6 weeks, he would not be participating at the 2022 World Aquatics Championships held in June in Budapest [81] Peaty returned to compete in the 2022 Commonwealth Games after his injury but was beaten in the final of the 100m breaststroke for the first time in 8 years, finishing fourth behind England team-mate James Wilby and Australians Zac Stubblety-Cook and Sam Williamson Peaty later said that he didn't know \"what went wrong\" and that he has \"kind of lost that spark\" [82] [83] Peaty later went on to win gold in the 50m breaststroke event for the first time at the Commonwealth Games, winning in a time of 26.76 seconds After the race he said that he has his 'spark back' but did not go on to race in any of the relay events at the championships and also chose to skip the 2022 European Championships [84]\n\n\n2024\nAfter winning the 100 metres breaststroke at the 2024 Aquatics GB Swimming Championships, Peaty sealed his place at the 2024 Summer Olympics [90] At the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, Peaty won the silver medal in the 100m breaststroke, finishing tied with Nic Fink and behind Nicolò Martinenghi [91] It was revealed the next day that Peaty was feeling slightly unwell before the final, and tested positive for Covid the morning after the final [92]\n\n\nPersonal life\nWhile Peaty was training at Loughborough University, he met girlfriend Eirianedd Munro, a student at the university [93] In April 2020, he announced that the couple were expecting a baby boy [94] [95] [96] Their son was born on 11 September 2020 [97] In August 2022, he announced their breakup [98] He is currently engaged to Holly Ramsay, [99] daughter of celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay Peaty is a football fan, and supports Nottingham Forest [100] Among his many tattoos are an image of the Greek god Poseidon and the year 2016 in Roman numerals (MMXVI) [101]\n\n\nPhysical attributes\nPeaty is physiologically particularly adapted to swimming the breast stroke; he has been described, like Michael Phelps, as \"an anatomical freak\" [115] [116] He is tall at 1.91 m (6 ft 3 in), with large hands and feet (shoe size 12), and has hypermobile knees and ankles As his knees hyperextend he can kick particularly effectively; his ankles help by flexing in a way other people's ankles do not [115] He has also been described as having an \"extraordinary\" cardiovascular system [18]\n\n\nAwards and honours\nPeaty received the FINA award for Best Male Swimming Performance of 2015 after he won 3 gold medals at the World Championships in Kazan [117] [118] In 2016, he was again honoured by FINA for the best male Olympic swimming performance of the year award after breaking the 100m breaststroke world record at the 2016 Olympics [119] [120] Peaty has won the Ligue Européenne de Natation (LEN) Award for best male swimmer for three times in four years for his performances in 2016, 2017 and 2019 [121] He was the recipient of the award again in 2021 [122] [123]\n\n\nInternational championships (50 m)\n\n\nInternational championships (25

{"title": "Android_(operating_system)", "content": "\nHistory\nAndroid Inc was founded in Palo Alto, California, in October 2003 by Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears, and Chris White [14] [15] Rubin described the Android project as having \"tremendous potential in developing smarter mobile devices that are more aware of its owner's location and preferences\" [15] The early intentions of the company were to develop an advanced operating system for digital cameras, and this was the basis of its pitch to investors in April 2004 [16] The company then decided that the market for cameras was not large enough for its goals, and five months later it had diverted its efforts and was pitching Android as a handset operating system that would rival Symbian and Microsoft Windows Mobile [16] [17]\n\n\nFeatures\nAndroid's default user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation, using touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions, like swiping, tapping, pinching, and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen objects, along with a virtual keyboard [83] Game controllers and full-size physical keyboards are supported via Bluetooth or USB [84] [85] The response to user input is designed to be immediate and provides a fluid touch interface, often using the vibration capabilities of the device to provide haptic feedback to the user Internal hardware, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and proximity sensors are used by some applications to respond to additional user actions, for example adjusting the screen from portrait to landscape depending on how the device is oriented, [86] or allowing the user to steer a vehicle in a racing game by rotating the device, simulating control of a steering wheel [87]\n\n\nInterface\nAndroid's default user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation, using touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions, like swiping, tapping, pinching, and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen objects, along with a virtual keyboard [83] Game controllers and full-size physical keyboards are supported via Bluetooth or USB [84] [85] The response to user input is designed to be immediate and provides a fluid

some applications to respond to additional user actions, for example adjusting the screen from portrait to landscape depending on how the device is oriented, [86] or allowing the user to steer a vehicle in a racing game by rotating the device, simulating control of a steering wheel [87]\n\n\nHome screen\nAndroid devices boot to the home screen, the primary navigation and information \"hub\" on Android devices, analogous to the desktop found on personal computers Android home screens are typically made up of app icons and widgets; app icons launch the associated app, whereas widgets display live, auto-updating content, such as a weather forecast, the user's email inbox, or a news ticker directly on the home screen [88] A home screen may be made up of several pages, between which the user can swipe back and forth [89] Third-party apps available on Google Play and other app stores can extensively re-theme the home screen, [90] and even mimic the look of other operating systems, such as Windows Phone [91] Most manufacturers customize the look and features of their Android devices to differentiate themselves from their competitors [92]\n\n\nStatus bar\nAlong the top of the screen is a status bar, showing information about the device and its connectivity This status bar can be pulled (swiped) down from to reveal a notification screen where apps display important information or updates, as well as quick access to system controls and toggles such as display brightness, connectivity settings (WiFi, Bluetooth, cellular data), audio mode, and flashlight [89] Vendors may implement extended settings such as the ability to adjust the flashlight brightness [93]\n\n\nNotifications\nNotifications are \"short, timely, and relevant information about your app when it's not in use\", and when tapped, users are directed to a screen inside the app relating to the notification [94] Beginning with Android 4.1 \"Jelly Bean\", \"expandable notifications\" allow the user to tap an icon on the notification in order for it to expand and display more information and possible app actions right from the notification [95]\n\n\nApp lists\nAn \"All Apps\" screen lists all installed applications, with the ability for users to drag an app from the list onto the home screen The app list may be accessed using a gesture or a button, depending on the Android version A \"Recents\" screen, also known as \"Overview\", lets users switch between recently used apps [89]\n\n\nNavigation buttons\nMany early Android OS smartphones were equipped with a dedicated search button for quick access to a web search engine and individual apps' internal search feature More recent devices typically allow the former through a long press or swipe away from the home button [97]\n\n\nSplit-screen view\nNative support for split screen view has been added in stock Android version 7.0 Nougat [100]\n\n\nCharging while powered off\nWhen connecting or disconnecting charging power and when shortly actuating the power button or home button, all while the device is powered off, a visual battery meter whose appearance varies among vendors appears on the screen, allowing the user to quickly assess the charge status of a powered-off without having to boot it up first Some display the battery percentage [102]\n\n\nApplications\nMost Android devices come with preinstalled Google apps including Gmail, Google Maps, Google Chrome, YouTube, Google Play Movies & TV, and others.\n\n\nStorage\nThe storage of Android devices can be expanded using secondary devices such as SD cards Android recognizes two types of secondary storage: portable storage (which is used by default), and adoptable storage Portable storage is treated as an external storage device Adoptable storage, introduced on Android 6.0, allows the internal storage of the device to be spanned with the SD card, treating it as an extension of the internal storage This has the disadvantage of preventing the memory card from being used with another device unless it is reformatted [126]\n\n\nMemory management\nSince Android devices are usually battery-powered, Android is designed to manage processes to keep power consumption at a minimum When an application is not in use the system suspends its operation so that, while available for immediate use rather than closed, it does not use battery power or CPU resources [131] [132] Android manages the applications stored in memory automatically: when memory is low, the system will begin invisibly and automatically closing inactive processes, starting with those that have been inactive for the longest amount of time [133] [134] Lifehacker reported in 2011 that third-party task-killer applications were doing more harm than good [135]\n\n\nDeveloper options\nSome settings for use by developers for debugging and power users are located in a \"Developer options\" sub menu, such as the ability to highlight updating parts of the display, show an overlay with the current status of the touch screen, show touching spots for possible use in screencasting, notify the user of unresponsive background processes with the option to end them (\"Show all ANRs\", i.e \"App's Not Responding\"), prevent a Bluetooth audio client from controlling the system volume (\"Disable absolute volume\"), and adjust the duration of transition animations or deactivate them completely to speed up navigation [136] [137] [138]\n\n\nHardware\nThe main hardware platform for Android is ARM (the ARMv7 and ARMv8-A architectures), with x86 and x86-64 architectures also officially supported in later versions of Android [142] [143] [144] The unofficial Android-x86 project provided support for x86 architectures ahead of the official support [145] [146] Since 2012, Android devices with Intel processors began to appear, including phones [147] and tablets While gaining support for 64-bit platforms, Android was first made to run on 64-bit x86 and then on ARM64 An unofficial experimental port of the operating system to the RISC-V architecture was released in 2021 [148]\n\n\nDevelopment\nAndroid is developed by Google until the latest changes and updates are ready to be released, at which point the source code is made available to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), [161] an open source initiative led by Google [162] The first source code release happened as part of the initial release in 2007 All releases are under the Apache License [163]\n\n\nUpdate schedule\nGoogle provides annual [168] Android releases, both for factory installation in new devices, and for over-the-air updates to existing devices [169] The latest major release is Android 14.\n\n\nLinux kernel\nAndroid's kernel is based on the Linux kernel's long-term support (LTS) branches As of 2024 [update], Android (14) uses versions 6.1 or 5.15 (for \"Feature kernels\", can be older for \"Launch kernels\", e.g android12-5.10, android11-5.4, depending on Android version down to e.g android11-5.4, android-4.14-stable, android-4.9-q), and older Android versions, use version 5.15 or a number of older kernels [190] The actual kernel depends on the individual device [191]\n\n\nRooting\nThe flash storage on Android devices is split into several partitions, such as /system/ for the operating system itself, and /data/ for user data and application installations [212]\n\n\nSoftware stack\nOn top of the Linux kernel, there are the middleware, libraries and APIs written in C, and application software running on an application framework which includes Java-compatible libraries Development of the Linux kernel continues independently of Android's other source code projects.\n\n\nOpen-source community\nAndroid's source code is released by Google under an open-source license, and its open nature has encouraged a large community of developers and enthusiasts to use the open-source code as a foundation for community-driven projects, which deliver updates to older devices, add new features for advanced users or bring Android to devices originally shipped with other operating systems [227] These community-developed releases often bring new features and updates to devices faster than through the official manufacturer/carrier channels, with a comparable level of quality; [228] provide continued support for older devices that no longer receive official updates; or bring Android to devices that were officially released running other operating systems, such as the HP TouchPad Community releases often come pre-rooted and contain modifications not provided by the original vendor, such as the ability to overclock or over/undervolt the device's processor [229] CyanogenMod was the most widely used community firmware, [230] now discontinued and succeeded by LineageOS [231]\n\n\nDevice codenames\nInternally, Android identifies each supported device by its device codename, a short string, [239] which may or may not be similar to the model name used in marketing the device For example, the device codename of the Pixel smartphone is sailfish.\n\n\nSecurity and privacy\nIn 2020, Google launched the Android Partner Vulnerability Initiative to improve the security of Android [241] [242] They also formed an Android security team [243]\n\n\nCommon security threats\nResearch from security company Trend Micro lists premium service abuse as the most common type of Android malware, where text messages are sent from infected phones to premium-rate telephone numbers without the consent or even knowledge of the user Other malware displays unwanted and intrusive advertisements on the device, or sends personal information to unauthorised third parties [244] Security threats on Android are reportedly growing exponentially; however, Google engineers have argued that the malware and virus threat on Android is being exaggerated by security companies for commercial reasons, [245] [246] and have accused the security industry of playing on fears to sell virus protection software to users [245] Google maintains that dangerous malware is actually extremely rare, [246] and a survey conducted by F-Secure showed that only 0.5% of Android malware reported had come from the Google Play store [247]\n\n\nScope of surveillance by public institutions\nAs part of the broader 2013 mass surveillance disclosures it was revealed in September 2013 that the American and British intelligence agencies, the National Security Agency (NSA) and Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), respectively, have access to the user data on iPhone, BlackBerry, and Android devices They were reportedly able to read almost all smartphone information, including SMS, location, emails, and notes [251] In January 2014, further reports revealed the intelligence agencies' capabilities to intercept the personal information transmitted across the Internet by social networks and other popular applications such as Angry Birds, which collect personal information of their users for advertising and other commercial reasons GCHQ has, according to The Guardian, a wiki-style guide of different apps and advertising networks, and the different data that can be siphoned from each [252] Later that week, the Finnish Angry Birds developer Rovio announced that it was reconsidering its relationships with its advertising platforms in the light of these revelations, and called upon the wider industry to do the same [253]\n\n\nSecurity patches\nIn August 2015, Google announced that devices in the Google Nexus series would begin to receive monthly security patches Google also wrote that \"Nexus devices will continue to receive major updates for at least two years and security patches for the longer of three years from initial availability or 18 months from last sale of the device via the Google Store.\" [256] [257] [258] The following October, researchers at the University of Cambridge concluded that 87.7% of Android phones in use had known but unpatched security vulnerabilities due to lack of updates and support [259] [260] [261] Ron Amadeo of Ars Technica wrote also in August 2015 that \"Android was originally designed, above all else, to be widely adopted Google was starting from scratch with zero percent market share, so it was happy to give up control and give everyone a seat at the table in exchange for adoption  [...] Now, though, Android has around 75–80 percent of the worldwide smartphone market—making it not just the world's most popular mobile operating system but arguably the most popular operating system, period As such, security has become a big issue Android still uses a software update chain-of-command designed back when the Android ecosystem had zero devices to update, and it just doesn't work\" [262] Following news of Google's monthly schedule, some manufacturers, including Samsung and LG, promised to issue monthly security updates, [263] but, as noted by Jerry Hildenbrand in Android Central in February 2016, \"instead we got a few updates on specific versions of a small handful of models And a bunch of broken promises\" [264]\n\n\nLocation-tracking\nAndroid smartphones have the ability to report the location of Wi-Fi access points, encountered as phone users move around, to build databases containing the physical locations of hundreds of millions of such access points These databases form electronic maps to locate smartphones, allowing them to run apps like Foursquare, Google Latitude, Facebook Places, and to deliver location-based ads [271] Third party monitoring software such as TaintDroid, [272] an academic research-funded project, can, in some cases, detect when personal information is being sent from applications to remote servers [273]\n\n\nFurther notable exploits\nIn 2018, Norwegian security firm Promon has unearthed a serious Android security hole which can be exploited to steal login credentials, access messages, and track location, which could be found in all versions of Android, including Android 10 The vulnerability came by exploiting a bug in the multitasking system enabling a malicious app to overlay legitimate apps with fake login screens that users are not aware of when handing in security credentials Users can also be tricked into granting additional permissions to the malicious apps, which later enable them to perform various nefarious activities, including intercepting texts or calls and stealing banking credentials [274] Avast Threat Labs also discovered that many pre-installed apps on several hundred new Android devices contain dangerous malware and adware Some of the preinstalled malware can commit ad fraud or even take over its host device [275] [276]\n\n\nTechnical security features\nAndroid applications run in a sandbox, an isolated area of the system that does not have access to the rest of the system's resources, unless access permissions are explicitly granted by the user when the application is installed, however this may not be possible for pre-installed apps It is not possible, for example, to turn off the microphone access of the pre-installed camera app without disabling the camera completely This is valid also in Android versions 7 and 8 [279]\n\n\nVerified Boot\nThe Android Open Source Project implements a verified boot chain with intentions to verify that executed code, such as the kernel or bootloader, comes from an official source instead of a malicious actor This implementation establishes a full chain of trust, as it initially starts at a hardware level Subsequently, the boot loader is verified and system partitions such as system and vendor are checked for integrity [302] [303]\n\n\ndm-verity\nAndroid (all supported versions, as far back as version 4.4 of the Android Open Source Project) has the option to provide a verified boot chain with dm-verity This is a feature in the Linux kernel that allows for transparent integrity checking of block devices [304] [305]\n\n\nGoogle Play Services and vendor changes\nDependence on proprietary Google Play Services and customizations added on top of the operating system by vendors who license Android from Google is causing privacy concerns [306] [307] [308]\n\n\nCriticism and controversy\nIn 2019, Google was fined €50 Million by the French CNIL for a lack of information regarding their users [309]\n\n\nPrivacy and GPDR compliance\nIn 2019, Google was fined €50 Million by the French CNIL for a lack of information regarding their users [309]\n\n\nFrance\nIn 2019, Google was fined €50 Million by the French CNIL for a lack of information regarding their users [309]\n\n\nAustralia\nGoogle was sanctioned about A$60 Million (approx 40Million USD) in Australia for having misled its Android customers It concerns the 2017–2018 period where the issue regarding misleading location tracking settings was discovered, and the case came under Australia’s Competition & Consumer Commission responsibility The trial concluded in 2021 when the court decided Google broke Consumer law for about 1.3 million of Google account owners [313]\n\n\nUnited States of America\nA similar case to the 2019 French case regarding location tracking, was brought in the U.S in a  privacy lawsuit filed by a coalition of attorneys general from 40 U.S states A penalty of USD 391 Million was agreed between Google and the DoJ [314] The New York Times released at that time a long-term investigation about those privacy concerns [315]\n\n\nLack of software support for a decade\nIn the 2010s, many customers discovered that their devices were affected by a very short term of software support, regarding Android updates [316] Especially on low-end and mid-range devices, due to the lack of investment by manufacturers, software upgrades were not effected [317] Android started then to get a certain reputation due to very fast obsolescence [318] of device from main customer brands [319] A few years later Google started Treble project, allowing quicker development and deployment of Android updates via Google Play services, to handle the part manufacturers don't.\n\n\nLicensing\nThe source code for Android is open-source: it is developed in private by Google, with the source code released publicly when a new version of Android is released Google publishes most of the code (including network and telephony stacks) under the non-copyleft Apache License version 2.0 which allows modification and redistribution [326] [327] The license does not grant rights to the \"Android\" trademark, so device manufacturers and wireless carriers have to license it from Google under individual contracts Associated Linux kernel changes are released under the copyleft GNU General Public License version 2, developed by the Open Handset Alliance, with the source code publicly available at all times [328] The only Android release which was not immediately made available as source code was the tablet-only 3.0 Honeycomb release The reason, according to Andy Rubin in an official Android blog post, was because Honeycomb was rushed for production of the Motorola Xoom, [329] and they did not want third parties creating a \"really bad user experience\" by attempting to put onto smartphones a version of Android intended for tablets [330]\n\n\nLeverage over manufacturers\nGoogle licenses their Google Mobile Services software, along with the Android trademarks, only to hardware manufacturers for devices that meet Google's compatibility standards specified in the Android Compatibility Program document [336] Thus, forks of Android that make major changes to the operating system itself do not include any of Google's non-free components, stay incompatible with applications that require them, and must ship with an alternative software marketplace in lieu of Google Play Store [114] A prominent example of such an Android fork is Amazon's Fire OS, which is used on the Kindle Fire line of tablets, and oriented toward Amazon services [114] The shipment of Android devices without GMS is also common in mainland China, as Google does not do business there [337] [338] [339]\n\n\nReception\nAndroid received a lukewarm reaction when it was unveiled in 2007 Although analysts were impressed with the respected technology companies that had partnered with Google to form the Open Handset Alliance, it was unclear whether mobile phone manufacturers would be willing to replace their existing operating systems with Android [351] The idea of an open-source, Linux-based development platform sparked interest, [352] but there were additional worries about Android facing strong competition from established players in the smartphone market, such as Nokia and Microsoft, and rival Linux mobile operating systems that were in development [353] These established players were skeptical: Nokia was quoted as saying \"we don't see this as a threat\", and a member of Microsoft's Windows Mobile team stated \"I don't understand the impact that they are going to have.\" [354]\n\n\nMarket share\nAndroid is the most used operating system on phones in virtually all countries, with some countries, such as India, having over 96% market share [364] On tablets, usage is more even, as iOS is a bit more popular globally.\n\n\nAdoption on tablets\nDespite its success on smartphones, initially Android tablet adoption was slow, [420] then later caught up with the iPad, in most countries One of the main causes was the chicken or the egg situation where consumers were hesitant to buy an Android tablet due to a lack of high quality tablet applications, but developers were hesitant to spend time and resources developing tablet applications until there was a significant market for them [421] [422] The content and app \"ecosystem\" proved more important than hardware specs as the selling point for tablets Due to the lack of Android tablet-specific applications in 2011, early Android tablets had to make do with existing smartphone applications that were ill-suited to larger screen sizes, whereas the dominance of Apple's iPad was reinforced by the large number of tablet-specific iOS applications [422] [423]\n\n\nPlatform information\nAndroid has 71% market share  vs Apple's iOS/iPadOS at 28% (on tablets alone Apple is slightly ahead, i.e 44% vs 56%, though Android is ahead in virtually all countries) The latest Android 14 is the most popular Android version on smartphones and on tablets.\n\n\nApplication piracy\nPaid Android applications in the past were simple to pirate [445] In a May 2012 interview with Eurogamer, the developers of Football Manager stated that the ratio of pirated players vs legitimate players was 9:1 for their game Football Manager Handheld [446] However, not every developer agreed that piracy rates were an issue; for example, in July 2012 the developers of the game Wind-up Knight said that piracy levels of their game were only 12%, and most of the piracy came from China, where people cannot purchase apps from Google Play [447]\n\n\nLegal issues\nThe success of Android has made it a target for patent and copyright litigation between technology companies, both Android and Android phone manufacturers having been involved in numerous patent lawsuits and other legal challenges.\n\n\nPatent lawsuit with Oracle\nOn August 12, 2010, Oracle sued Google over claimed infringement of copyrights and patents related to the Java programming language [451] Oracle originally sought damages up to $6.1 billion, [452] but this valuation was rejected by a United States federal judge who asked Oracle to revise the estimate [453] In response, Google submitted multiple lines of defense, counterclaiming that Android did not infringe on Oracle's patents or copyright, that Oracle's patents were invalid, and several other defenses They said that Android's Java runtime environment is based on Apache Harmony, a clean room implementation of the Java class libraries, and an independently developed virtual machine called Dalvik [454] In May 2012, the jury in this case found that Google did not infringe on Oracle's patents, and the trial judge ruled that the structure of the Java APIs used by Google was not copyrightable [455] [456] The parties agreed to zero dollars in statutory damages for a small amount of copied code [457] On May 9, 2014, the Federal Circuit partially reversed the district court ruling, ruling in Oracle's favor on the copyrightability issue, and remanding the issue of fair use to the district court [458] [459]\n\n\nAnti-competitive challenges in Europe\nIn 2013, FairSearch, a lobbying organization supported by Microsoft, Oracle and others, filed a complaint regarding Android with the European Commission, alleging that its free-of-charge distribution model constituted anti-competitive predatory pricing The Free Software Foundation Europe, whose donors include Google, disputed the Fairsearch allegations [462] On April 20, 2016, the EU filed a formal antitrust complaint against Google based upon the FairSearch allegations, arguing that its leverage over Android vendors, including the mandatory bundling of the entire suite of proprietary Google software, hindering the ability for competing search providers to be integrated into Android, and barring vendors from producing devices running forks of Android, constituted anti-competitive practices [463] In August 2016, Google was fined US$6.75 million by the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) under similar allegations by Yandex [464] The European Commission issued its decision on July 18, 2018, determining that Google had conducted three operations related to Android that were in violation of antitrust regulations: bundling Google's search and Chrome as part of Android, blocking phone manufacturers from using forked versions of Android, and establishing deals with phone manufacturers and network providers to exclusively bundle the Google search application on handsets (a practice Google ended by 2014) The EU fined Google for €4.3 billion (about US$5 billion) and required the company to end this conduct within 90 days [465] Google filed its appeal of the ruling in October 2018, though will not ask for any interim measures to delay the onset of conduct requirements [466]\n\n\nOthers\nIn addition to lawsuits against Google directly, various proxy wars have been waged against Android indirectly by targeting manufacturers of Android devices, with the effect of discouraging manufacturers from adopting the platform by increasing the costs of bringing an Android device to market [468] Both Apple and Microsoft have sued several manufacturers for patent infringement, with Apple's legal action against Samsung being a particularly high-profile case In January 2012, Microsoft said they had signed patent license agreements with eleven Android device manufacturers, whose products account for \"70 percent of all Android smartphones\" sold in the US [469] and 55% of the worldwide revenue for Android devices [470] These include Samsung and HTC [471] Samsung's patent settlement with Microsoft included an agreement to allocate more resources to developing and marketing phones running Microsoft's Windows Phone operating system [468] Microsoft has also tied its own Android software to patent licenses, requiring the bundling of Microsoft Office Mobile and Skype applications on Android devices to subsidize the licensing fees, while at the same time helping to promote its software lines [472] [473]\n\n\nOther uses\nGoogle has developed several variations of Android for specific use cases, including Android Wear, later renamed Wear OS, for wearable devices such as wrist watches, [479] [480] Android TV for televisions, [481] [482] Android Things for smart or Internet of things devices and Android Automotive for cars [483] [484] Additionally, by providing infrastructure that combines dedicated hardware and dedicated applications running on regular Android, Google have opened up the platform for its use in particular usage scenarios, such as the Android Auto app for cars, [485] [486] and Daydream, a Virtual Reality platform [487]\n\n\nMascot\nThe mascot of Android is a green android robot, as related to the software's name Although it had no official name for a long time, the Android team at Google reportedly call it \"Bugdroid\" [531]\nIn 2024, a Google blog post revealed its official name, \"The Bot\" [532] [533]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Android**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nAndroid is an open-source mobile operating system developed by Google. First released in 2007, Android has since become the most widely used mobile operating system in the world, with over 71% market share. Android is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing manufacturers to create a wide range of devices that cater to different needs and preferences. This article provides an overview of the Android operating system, its features, and its evolution over the years.\n\n**History**\n\nAndroid was first developed in 2003 by Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears, and Chris White in Palo Alto, California. The early intentions of the company were to develop an advanced operating system for digital cameras, but the market for cameras was not large enough, and the company diverted its efforts to develop an operating system for handsets that would rival Symbian and Microsoft Windows Mobile. In 2007, Google acquired Android and released the first version of the operating system, Android 1.0.\n\n**Features**\n\nAndroid's default user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation, using touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions, like swiping, tapping, pinching, and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen objects, along with a virtual keyboard. Game controllers and full-size physical keyboards are supported via Bluetooth or USB. The response to user input is designed to be immediate and provides a fluid touch interface, often using the vibration capabilities of the device to provide haptic feedback to the user.\n\n**Interface**\n\nThe Android interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. The home screen is the primary navigation and information \"hub\" on Android devices, analogous to the desktop found on personal computers. Android home screens are typically made up of app icons and widgets; app icons launch the associated app, whereas widgets display live, auto-updating content, such as a weather forecast, the user's email inbox, or a news ticker directly on the home screen.\n\n**Status Bar**\n\nAlong the top of the screen is a status bar, showing information about the device and its connectivity. This status bar can be pulled (swiped) down from to reveal a notification screen where apps display important information or updates, as well as quick access to system controls and toggles such as display brightness, connectivity settings (WiFi, Bluetooth, cellular data), audio mode, and flashlight.\n\n**Notifications**\n\nNotifications are \"short, timely, and relevant information about your app when it's not in use\", and when tapped, users are directed to a screen inside the app relating to the notification. Beginning with Android 4.1 \"Jelly Bean\", \"expandable notifications\" allow the user to tap an icon on the notification in order for it to expand and display more information and possible app actions right from the notification.\n\n**App Lists**\n\nAn \"All Apps\" screen lists all installed applications, with the ability for users to drag an app from the list onto the home screen. The app list may be accessed using a gesture or a button, depending on the Android version. A \"Recents\" screen, also known as \"Overview\", lets users switch between recently used apps.\n\n**Navigation Buttons**\n\nMany early Android OS smartphones were equipped with a dedicated search button for quick access to a web search engine and individual apps' internal search feature. More recent devices typically allow the former through a long press or swipe away from the home button.\n\n**Split-Screen View**\n\nNative support for split-screen view has been added in stock Android version 7.0 Nougat.\n\n**Charging While Powered Off**\n\nWhen connecting or disconnecting charging power and when shortly actuating the power button or home button, all while the device is powered off, a visual battery meter whose appearance varies among vendors appears on the screen, allowing the user to quickly assess the charge status of a powered-off device without having to boot it up first.\n\n**Storage**\n\nThe storage of Android devices can be expanded using secondary devices such as SD cards. Android recognizes two types of secondary storage: portable storage (which is used by default), and adoptable storage. Portable storage is treated as an external storage device, whereas adoptable storage allows the internal storage of the device to be spanned with the SD card, treating it as an extension of the internal storage.\n\n**Memory Management**\n\nAndroid is designed to manage processes to keep power consumption at a minimum. When an application is not in use, the system suspends its operation so that, while available for immediate use rather than closed, it does not use battery power or CPU resources. Android manages the applications stored in memory automatically: when memory is low, the system will begin invisibly and automatically closing inactive processes, starting with those that have been inactive for the longest amount of time.\n\n**Developer Options**\n\nSome settings for use by developers for debugging and power users are located in a \"Developer options\" sub menu, such as the ability to highlight updating parts of the display, show an overlay with the current status of the touch screen, show touching spots for possible use in screencasting, notify the user of unresponsive background processes with the option to end them (\"Show all ANRs\", i.e \"App's Not Responding\"), prevent a Bluetooth audio client from controlling the system volume (\"Disable absolute volume\"), and adjust the duration of transition animations or deactivate them completely to speed up navigation.\n\n**Hardware**\n\nThe main hardware platform for Android is ARM (the ARMv7 and ARMv8-A architectures), with x86 and x86-64 architectures also officially supported in later versions of Android. The unofficial Android-x86 project provided support for x86 architectures ahead of the official support. Since 2012, Android devices with Intel processors have appeared, including phones and tablets.\n\n**Development**\n\nAndroid is developed by Google until the latest changes and updates are ready to be released, at which point the source code is made available to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), an open source initiative led by Google. The source code is released publicly when a new version of Android is released. Google publishes most of the code (including network and telephony stacks) under the non-copyleft Apache License version 2.0, which allows modification and redistribution. The license does not grant rights to the \"Android\" trademark, so device manufacturers and wireless carriers have to license it from Google under individual contracts.\n\n**Licensing**\n\nThe source code for Android is open-source: it is developed in private by Google, with the source code released publicly when a new version of Android is released.

The idea of an open-source, Linux-based development platform sparked interest, but there were additional worries about Android facing strong competition from established players in the smartphone market, such as Nokia and Microsoft, and rival Linux mobile operating systems that were in development.\n\n**Market Share**\n\nAndroid is the most used operating system on phones in virtually all countries, with some countries, such as India, having over 96% market share. On tablets, usage is more even, as iOS is a bit more popular globally.\n\n**Patent Lawsuits**\n\nThe success of Android has made it a target for patent and copyright litigation between technology companies, both Android and Android phone manufacturers having been involved in numerous patent lawsuits and other legal challenges.

From its early days as a digital camera operating system to its current status as the most widely used mobile operating system in the world, Android has evolved into a robust and feature-rich platform. With its open-source nature and flexibility, Android has become a favorite among developers and users alike. As technology continues to advance, it will be interesting to see how Android will adapt and evolve to meet the changing needs of its users.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Android_(operating_system)\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nAndroid Inc was founded in Palo Alto, California, in October 2003 by Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears, and Chris White [14] [15] Rubin described the Android project as having \"tremendous potential in developing smarter mobile devices that are more aware of its owner's location and preferences\" [15] The early intentions of the company were to develop an advanced operating system for digital cameras, and this was the basis of its pitch to investors in April 2004 [16] The company then decided that the market for cameras was not large enough for its goals, and five months later it had diverted its efforts and was pitching Android as a handset operating system that would rival Symbian and Microsoft Windows Mobile [16] [17]\n\n\nFeatures\nAndroid's default user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation, using touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions, like swiping, tapping,

response to user input is designed to be immediate and provides a fluid touch interface, often using the vibration capabilities of the device to provide haptic feedback to the user Internal hardware, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and proximity sensors are used by some applications to respond to additional user actions, for example adjusting the screen from portrait to landscape depending on how the device is oriented, [86] or allowing the user to steer a vehicle in a racing game by rotating the device, simulating control of a steering wheel [87]\n\n\nInterface\nAndroid's default user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation, using touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions, like swiping, tapping, pinching, and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen

whereas widgets display live, auto-updating content, such as a weather forecast, the user's email inbox, or a news ticker directly on the home screen [88] A home screen may be made up of several pages, between which the user can swipe back and forth [89] Third-party apps available on Google Play and other app stores can extensively re-theme the home screen, [90] and even mimic the look of other operating systems, such as Windows Phone [91] Most manufacturers customize the look and features of their Android devices to differentiate themselves from their competitors [92]\n\n\nStatus bar\nAlong the top of the screen is a status bar, showing information about the device and its connectivity This status bar can be pulled (swiped) down from to reveal a notification screen where apps display important information or updates, as well as quick access to system controls and toggles such as display brightness, connectivity settings (WiFi, Bluetooth, cellular data), audio mode, and

disconnecting charging power and when shortly actuating the power button or home button, all while the device is powered off, a visual battery meter whose appearance varies among vendors appears on the screen, allowing the user to quickly assess the charge status of a powered-off without having to boot it up first Some display the battery percentage [102]\n\n\nApplications\nMost Android devices come with preinstalled Google apps including Gmail, Google Maps, Google Chrome, YouTube, Google Play Movies & TV, and others.\n\n\nStorage\nThe storage of Android devices can be expanded using secondary devices such as SD cards Android recognizes two types of secondary storage: portable storage (which is used by default), and adoptable storage Portable storage is treated as an external storage device Adoptable storage, introduced on Android 6.0, allows the internal storage of the device to be spanned with the SD card, treating it as an extension of the internal storage This has the disadvantage of preventing the memory card from being used with another device unless it is reformatted [126]\n\n\nMemory management\nSince Android devices are usually battery-powered, Android is designed to manage processes to keep power consumption at a minimum When an application is not in use the system suspends its operation so that, while available for immediate use rather than closed, it does not use battery power or CPU resources [131] [132] Android manages the applications stored in memory automatically: when memory is low, the system will begin invisibly and automatically closing inactive processes, starting with those that have been inactive for the longest amount of time [133] [134] Lifehacker reported in 2011 that third-party task-killer applications were doing more harm than good [135]\n\n\nDeveloper options\nSome settings for use by developers for debugging and power users are located in a \"Developer options\" sub menu, such as the ability to highlight updating parts of the display, show an overlay with the current status of the touch screen, show touching spots for possible use in screencasting, notify the user of unresponsive background processes with the option to end them (\"Show all ANRs\", i.e \"App's Not Responding\"), prevent a Bluetooth audio client from controlling the system volume (\"Disable absolute volume\"), and adjust the duration of transition animations or deactivate them completely to speed up navigation [136] [137] [138]\n\n\nHardware\nThe main hardware platform for Android is ARM (the ARMv7 and ARMv8-A architectures), with x86 and x86-64 architectures also officially supported in later versions of Android [142] [143] [144] The unofficial Android-x86 project provided support for x86 architectures ahead of the official support [145] [146] Since 2012, Android devices with Intel processors began to appear, including phones [147] and tablets While gaining support for 64-bit platforms, Android was first made to run on 64-bit x86 and then on ARM64 An unofficial experimental port of the operating system to the RISC-V architecture was released in 2021 [148]\n\n\nDevelopment\nAndroid is developed by Google until the latest changes and updates are ready to be released, at which point the source code is made available to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), [161] an open source initiative led by Google [162] The first source code release happened as part of the initial release in 2007 All releases are under the Apache License [163]\n\n\nUpdate schedule\nGoogle provides annual [168] Android releases, both for factory installation in new devices, and for over-the-air updates to existing devices [169] The latest major release is Android 14.\n\n\nLinux kernel\nAndroid's kernel is based on the Linux kernel's long-term support (LTS) branches As of 2024 [update], Android (14) uses versions 6.1 or 5.15 (for \"Feature kernels\", can be older for \"Launch kernels\", e.g android12-5.10, android11-5.4, depending on Android version down to e.g android11-5.4, android-4.14-stable, android-4.9-q), and older Android versions, use version 5.15 or a number of older kernels [190] The actual kernel depends on the individual device [191]\n\n\nRooting\nThe flash storage on Android devices is split into several partitions, such as /system/ for the operating system itself, and /data/ for user data and application installations [212]\n\n\nSoftware stack\nOn top of the Linux kernel, there are the middleware, libraries and APIs written in C, and application software running on an application framework which includes Java-compatible libraries Development of the Linux kernel continues independently of Android's other source code projects.\n\n\nOpen-source community\nAndroid's source code is released by Google under an open-source license, and its open nature has encouraged a large community of developers and enthusiasts to use the open-source code as a foundation for community-driven projects, which deliver updates to older devices, add new features for advanced users or bring Android to devices originally shipped with other operating systems [227] These community-developed releases often bring new features and updates to devices faster than through the official manufacturer/carrier channels, with a comparable level of quality; [228] provide continued support for older devices that no longer receive official updates; or bring Android to devices that were officially released running other operating systems, such as the HP TouchPad Community releases often come pre-rooted and contain modifications not provided by the original vendor, such as the ability to overclock or over/undervolt the device's processor [229] CyanogenMod was the most widely used community firmware, [230] now discontinued and succeeded by LineageOS [231]\n\n\nDevice codenames\nInternally, Android identifies each supported device by its device codename, a short string, [239] which may or may not be similar to the model name used in marketing the device For example, the device codename of the Pixel smartphone is sailfish.\n\n\nSecurity and privacy\nIn 2020, Google launched the Android Partner Vulnerability Initiative to improve the security of Android [241] [242] They also formed an Android security team [243]\n\n\nCommon security threats\nResearch from security company Trend Micro lists premium service abuse as the most common type of Android malware, where text messages are sent from infected phones to premium-rate telephone numbers without the consent or even knowledge of the user Other malware displays unwanted and intrusive advertisements on the device, or sends personal information to unauthorised third parties [244] Security threats on Android are reportedly growing exponentially; however, Google engineers have argued that the malware and virus threat on Android is being exaggerated by security companies for commercial reasons, [245] [246] and have accused the security industry of playing on fears to sell virus protection software to users [245] Google maintains that dangerous malware is actually extremely rare, [246] and a survey conducted by F-Secure showed that only 0.5% of Android malware reported had come from the Google Play store [247]\n\n\nScope of surveillance by public institutions\nAs part of the broader 2013 mass surveillance disclosures it was revealed in September 2013 that the American and British intelligence agencies, the National Security Agency (NSA) and Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), respectively, have access to the user data on iPhone, BlackBerry, and Android devices They were reportedly able to read almost all smartphone information, including SMS, location, emails, and notes [251] In January 2014, further reports revealed the intelligence agencies' capabilities to intercept the personal information transmitted across the Internet by social networks and other popular applications such as Angry Birds, which collect personal information of their users for advertising and other commercial reasons GCHQ has, according to The Guardian, a wiki-style guide of different apps and advertising networks, and the different data that can be siphoned from each [252] Later that week, the Finnish Angry Birds developer Rovio announced that it was reconsidering its relationships with its advertising platforms in the light of these revelations, and called upon the wider industry to do the same [253]\n\n\nSecurity patches\nIn August 2015, Google announced that devices in the Google Nexus series would begin to receive monthly security patches Google also wrote that \"Nexus devices will continue to receive major updates for at least two years and security patches for the longer of three years from initial availability or 18 months from last sale of the device via the Google Store.\" [256] [257] [258] The following October, researchers at the University of Cambridge concluded that 87.7% of Android phones in use had known but unpatched security vulnerabilities due to lack of updates and support [259] [260] [261] Ron Amadeo of Ars Technica wrote also in August 2015 that \"Android was originally designed, above all else, to be widely adopted Google was starting from scratch with zero percent market share, so it was happy to give up control and give everyone a seat at the table in exchange for adoption  [...] Now, though, Android has around 75–80 percent of the worldwide smartphone market—making it not just the world's most popular mobile operating system but arguably the most popular operating system, period As such, security has become a big issue Android still uses a software update chain-of-command designed back when the Android ecosystem had zero devices to update, and it just doesn't work\" [262] Following news of Google's monthly schedule, some manufacturers, including Samsung and LG, promised to issue monthly security updates, [263] but, as noted by Jerry Hildenbrand in Android Central in February 2016, \"instead we got a few updates on specific versions of a small handful of models And a bunch of broken promises\" [264]\n\n\nLocation-tracking\nAndroid smartphones have the ability to report the location of Wi-Fi access points, encountered as phone users move around, to build databases containing the physical locations of hundreds of millions of such access points These databases form electronic maps to locate smartphones, allowing them to run apps like Foursquare, Google Latitude, Facebook Places, and to deliver location-based ads [271] Third party monitoring software such as TaintDroid, [272] an academic research-funded project, can, in some cases, detect when personal information is being sent from applications to remote servers [273]\n\n\nFurther notable exploits\nIn 2018, Norwegian security firm Promon has unearthed a serious Android security hole which can be exploited to steal login credentials, access messages, and track location, which could be found in all versions of Android, including Android 10 The vulnerability came by exploiting a bug in the multitasking system enabling a malicious app to overlay legitimate apps with fake login screens that users are not aware of when handing in security credentials Users can also be tricked into granting additional permissions to the malicious apps, which later enable them to perform various nefarious activities, including intercepting texts or calls and stealing banking credentials [274] Avast Threat Labs also discovered that many pre-installed apps on several hundred new Android devices contain dangerous malware and adware Some of the preinstalled malware can commit ad fraud or even take over its host device [275] [276]\n\n\nTechnical security features\nAndroid applications run in a sandbox, an isolated area of the system that does not have access to the rest of the system's resources, unless access permissions are explicitly granted by the user when the application is installed, however this may not be possible for pre-installed apps It is not possible, for example, to turn off the microphone access of the pre-installed camera app without disabling the camera completely This is valid also in Android versions 7 and 8 [279]\n\n\nVerified Boot\nThe Android Open Source Project implements a verified boot chain with intentions to verify that executed code, such as the kernel or bootloader, comes from an official source instead of a malicious actor This implementation establishes a full chain of trust, as it initially starts at a hardware level Subsequently, the boot loader is verified and system partitions such as system and vendor are checked for integrity [302] [303]\n\n\ndm-verity\nAndroid (all supported versions, as far back as version 4.4 of the Android Open Source Project) has the option to provide a verified boot chain with dm-verity This is a feature in the Linux kernel that allows for transparent integrity checking of block devices [304] [305]\n\n\nGoogle Play Services and vendor changes\nDependence on proprietary Google Play Services and customizations added on top of the operating system by vendors who license Android from Google is causing privacy concerns [306] [307] [308]\n\n\nCriticism and controversy\nIn 2019, Google was fined €50 Million by the French CNIL for a lack of information regarding their users [309]\n\n\nPrivacy and GPDR compliance\nIn 2019, Google was fined €50 Million by the French CNIL for a lack of information regarding their users [309]\n\n\nFrance\nIn 2019, Google was fined €50 Million by the French CNIL for a lack of information regarding their users [309]\n\n\nAustralia\nGoogle was sanctioned about A$60 Million (approx 40Million USD) in Australia for having misled its Android customers It concerns the 2017–2018 period where the issue regarding misleading location tracking settings was discovered, and the case came under Australia’s Competition & Consumer Commission responsibility The trial concluded in 2021 when the court decided Google broke Consumer law for about 1.3 million of Google account owners [313]\n\n\nUnited States of America\nA similar case to the 2019 French case regarding location tracking, was brought in the U.S in a  privacy lawsuit filed by a coalition of attorneys general from 40 U.S states A penalty of USD 391 Million was agreed between Google and the DoJ [314] The New York Times released at that time a long-term investigation about those privacy concerns [315]\n\n\nLack of software support for a decade\nIn the 2010s, many customers discovered that their devices were affected by a very short term of software support, regarding Android updates [316] Especially on low-end and mid-range devices, due to the lack of investment by manufacturers, software upgrades were not effected [317] Android started then to get a certain reputation due to very fast obsolescence [318] of device from main customer brands [319] A few years later Google started Treble project, allowing quicker development and deployment of Android updates via Google Play services, to handle the part manufacturers don't.\n\n\nLicensing\nThe source code for Android is open-source: it is developed in private by Google, with the source code released publicly when a new version of Android is released Google publishes most of the code (including network and telephony stacks) under the non-copyleft Apache License version 2.0 which allows modification and redistribution [326] [327] The license does not grant rights to the \"Android\" trademark, so device manufacturers and wireless carriers have to license it from Google under individual contracts Associated Linux kernel changes are released under the copyleft GNU General Public License version 2, developed by the Open Handset Alliance, with the source code publicly available at all times [328] The only Android release which was not immediately made available as source code was the tablet-only 3.0 Honeycomb release The reason, according to Andy Rubin in an official Android blog post, was because Honeycomb was rushed for production of the Motorola Xoom, [329] and they did not want third parties creating a \"really bad user experience\" by attempting to put onto smartphones a version of Android intended for tablets [330]\n\n\nLeverage over manufacturers\nGoogle licenses their Google Mobile Services software, along with the Android trademarks, only to hardware manufacturers for devices that meet Google's compatibility standards specified in the Android Compatibility Program document [336] Thus, forks of Android that make major changes to the operating system itself do not include any of Google's non-free components, stay incompatible with applications that require them, and must ship with an alternative software marketplace in lieu of Google Play Store [114] A prominent example of such an Android fork is Amazon's Fire OS, which is used on the Kindle Fire line of tablets, and oriented toward Amazon services [114] The shipment of Android devices without GMS is also common in mainland China, as Google does not do business there [337] [338] [339]\n\n\nReception\nAndroid received a lukewarm reaction when it was unveiled in 2007 Although analysts were impressed with the respected technology companies that had partnered with Google to form the Open Handset Alliance, it was unclear whether mobile phone manufacturers would be willing to replace their existing operating systems with Android [351] The idea of an open-source, Linux-based development platform sparked interest, [352] but there were additional worries about Android facing strong competition from established players in the smartphone market, such as Nokia and Microsoft, and rival Linux mobile operating systems that were in development [353] These established players were skeptical: Nokia was quoted as saying \"we don't see this as a threat\", and a member of Microsoft's Windows Mobile team stated \"I don't understand the impact that they are going to have.\" [354]\n\n\nMarket share\nAndroid is the most used operating system on phones in virtually all countries, with some countries, such as India, having over 96% market share [364] On tablets, usage is more even, as iOS is a bit more popular globally.\n\n\nAdoption on tablets\nDespite its success on smartphones, initially Android tablet adoption was slow, [420] then later caught up with the iPad, in most countries One of the main causes was the chicken or the egg situation where consumers were hesitant to buy an Android tablet due to a lack of high quality tablet applications, but developers were hesitant to spend time and resources developing tablet applications until there was a significant market for them [421] [422] The content and app \"ecosystem\" proved more important than hardware specs as the selling point for tablets Due to the lack of Android tablet-specific applications in 2011, early Android tablets had to make do with existing smartphone applications that were ill-suited to larger screen sizes, whereas the dominance of Apple's iPad was reinforced by the large number of tablet-specific iOS applications [422] [423]\n\n\nPlatform information\nAndroid has 71% market share  vs Apple's iOS/iPadOS at 28% (on tablets alone Apple is slightly ahead, i.e 44% vs 56%, though Android is ahead in virtually all countries) The latest Android 14 is the most popular Android version on smartphones and on tablets.\n\n\nApplication piracy\nPaid Android applications in the past were simple to pirate [445] In a May 2012 interview with Eurogamer, the developers of Football Manager stated that the ratio of pirated players vs legitimate players was 9:1 for their game Football Manager Handheld [446] However, not every developer agreed that piracy rates were an issue; for example, in July 2012 the developers of the game Wind-up Knight said that piracy levels of their game were only 12%, and most of the piracy came from China, where people cannot purchase apps from Google Play [447]\n\n\nLegal issues\nThe success of Android has made it a target for patent and copyright litigation between technology companies, both Android and Android phone manufacturers having been involved in numerous patent lawsuits and other legal challenges.\n\n\nPatent lawsuit with Oracle\nOn August 12, 2010, Oracle sued Google over claimed infringement of copyrights and patents related to the Java programming language [451] Oracle originally sought damages up to $6.1 billion, [452] but this valuation was rejected by a United States federal judge who asked Oracle to revise the estimate [453] In response, Google submitted multiple lines of defense, counterclaiming that Android did not infringe on Oracle's patents or copyright, that Oracle's patents were invalid, and several other defenses They said that Android's Java runtime environment is based on Apache Harmony, a clean room implementation of the Java class libraries, and an independently developed virtual machine called Dalvik [454] In May 2012, the jury in this case found that Google did not infringe on Oracle's patents, and the trial judge ruled that the structure of the Java APIs used by Google was not copyrightable [455] [456] The parties agreed to zero dollars in statutory damages for a small amount of copied code [457] On May 9, 2014, the Federal Circuit partially reversed the district court ruling, ruling in Oracle's favor on the copyrightability issue, and remanding the issue of fair use to the district court [458] [459]\n\n\nAnti-competitive challenges in Europe\nIn 2013, FairSearch, a lobbying organization supported by Microsoft, Oracle and others, filed a complaint regarding Android with the European Commission, alleging that its free-of-charge distribution model constituted anti-competitive predatory pricing The Free Software Foundation Europe, whose donors include Google, disputed the Fairsearch allegations [462] On April 20, 2016, the EU filed a formal antitrust complaint against Google based upon the FairSearch allegations, arguing that its leverage over Android vendors, including the mandatory bundling of the entire suite of proprietary Google software, hindering the ability for competing search providers to be integrated into Android, and barring vendors from producing devices running forks of Android, constituted anti-competitive practices [463] In August 2016, Google was fined US$6.75 million by the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) under similar allegations by Yandex [464] The European Commission issued its decision on July 18, 2018, determining that Google had conducted three operations related to Android that were in violation of antitrust regulations: bundling Google's search and Chrome as part of Android, blocking phone manufacturers from using forked versions of Android, and establishing deals with phone manufacturers and network providers to exclusively bundle the Google search application on handsets (a practice Google ended by 2014) The EU fined Google for €4.3 billion (about US$5 billion) and required the company to end this conduct within 90 days [465] Google filed its appeal of the ruling in October 2018, though will not ask for any interim measures to delay the onset of conduct requirements [466]\n\n\nOthers\nIn addition to lawsuits against Google directly, various proxy wars have been waged against Android indirectly by targeting manufacturers of Android devices, with the effect of discouraging manufacturers from adopting the platform by increasing the costs of bringing an Android device to market [468] Both Apple and Microsoft have sued several manufacturers for patent infringement, with Apple's legal action against Samsung being a particularly high-profile case In January 2012, Microsoft said they had signed patent license agreements with eleven Android device manufacturers, whose products account for \"70 percent of all Android smartphones\" sold in the US [469] and 55% of the worldwide revenue for Android devices [470] These include Samsung and HTC [471] Samsung's patent settlement with Microsoft included an agreement to allocate more resources to developing and marketing phones running Microsoft's Windows Phone operating system [468] Microsoft has also tied its own Android software to patent licenses, requiring the bundling of Microsoft Office Mobile and Skype applications on Android devices to subsidize the licensing fees, while at the same time helping to promote its software lines [472] [473]\n\n\nOther uses\nGoogle has developed several variations of Android for specific use cases, including Android Wear, later renamed Wear OS, for wearable devices such as wrist watches, [479] [480] Android TV for televisions, [481] [482] Android Things for smart or Internet of things devices and Android Automotive for cars [483] [484] Additionally, by providing infrastructure that combines dedicated hardware and dedicated applications running on regular Android, Google have opened up the platform for its use in particular usage scenarios, such as the Android Auto app for cars, [485] [486] and Daydream, a Virtual Reality platform [487]\n\n\nMascot\nThe mascot of Android is a green android robot, as related to the software's name Although it had no official name for a long time, the Android team at Google reportedly call it \"Bugdroid\" [531]\nIn 2024, a Google blog post revealed its official name, \"The Bot\" [532] [533]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Henry_VIII", "content": "\nEarly years\nBorn on 28 June 1491 at the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich, Kent, Henry Tudor was the third child and second son of King Henry VII and Elizabeth of York [7] Of the young Henry's six (or seven) siblings, only three – his brother Arthur, Prince of Wales, and sisters Margaret and Mary – survived infancy [8] He was baptised by Richard Foxe, the Bishop of Exeter, at a church of the Observant Franciscans close to the palace [9] In 1493, at the age of two, Henry was appointed Constable of Dover Castle and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports He was subsequently appointed Earl Marshal of England and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland at age three and was made a Knight of the Bath soon after The day after the ceremony, he was created Duke of York and a month or so later made Warden of the Scottish Marches In May 1495, he was appointed to the Order of the Garter The reason for giving such appointments to a small child was to enable his father to retain personal control of lucrative positions and not share them with established families [9] Not much is known about Henry's early life – save for his appointments – because he was not expected to become king, [9] but it is known that he received a first-rate education from leading tutors He became fluent in Latin and French and learned at least some Italian [10] [11]\n\n\nEarly reign\nHenry VII died in April 1509, and the 17-year-old Henry succeeded him as king [21] Soon after his father's burial on 10 May, Henry suddenly declared that he would indeed marry Catherine, leaving unresolved several issues concerning the papal dispensation and a missing part of the marriage portion [18] [22] The new king maintained that it had been his father's dying wish that he marry Catherine [20] Whether or not this was true, it was convenient Emperor Maximilian I had been attempting to marry his granddaughter Eleanor, Catherine's niece, to Henry; she had now been jilted [23] Henry's wedding to Catherine was kept low-key and was held at the friars' church in Greenwich on 11 June 1509 [22] Henry claimed descent from Constantine the Great and King Arthur and saw himself as their successor [24]\n\n\nFrance and the Habsburgs\nIn 1510, France, with a fragile alliance with the Holy Roman Empire in the League of Cambrai, was winning a war against Venice Henry renewed his father's friendship with Louis XII of France, an issue that divided his council Certainly, war with the combined might of the two powers would have been exceedingly difficult [41] Shortly thereafter, however, Henry also signed a pact with Ferdinand II of Aragon After Pope Julius II created the anti-French Holy League in October 1511, [41] Henry followed Ferdinand's lead and brought England into the new League An initial joint Anglo-Spanish attack was planned for the spring to recover Aquitaine for England, the start of making Henry's dreams of ruling France a reality [42] The attack, however, following a formal declaration of war in April 1512, was not led by Henry personally [43] and was a considerable failure; Ferdinand used it simply to further his own ends, and it strained the Anglo-Spanish alliance Nevertheless, the French were pushed out of Italy soon after, and the alliance survived, with both parties keen to win further victories over the French [43] [44] Henry then pulled off a diplomatic coup by convincing Emperor Maximilian to join the Holy League [45] Remarkably, Henry had secured the promised title of \"Most Christian King of France\" from Julius and possibly coronation by the Pope himself in Paris, if only Louis could be defeated [46]\n\n\nMarriages\nKing Henry VIII and all six of his wives were related through a common ancestor, King Edward I of England [57]\n\n\nAnnulment from Catherine\nDuring his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, Henry conducted an affair with Mary Boleyn, Catherine's lady-in-waiting There has been speculation that Mary's two children, Henry Carey and Catherine Carey, were fathered by Henry but this has never been proven King Henry never acknowledged them as he did in the case of Henry FitzRoy [60] In 1525, as Henry grew more impatient with Catherine's inability to produce the male heir he desired, [61] [62] he became enamoured of Mary Boleyn's sister, Anne Boleyn, then a charismatic young woman of 25 in the Queen's entourage [63] Anne, however, resisted his attempts to seduce her, and refused to become his mistress as her sister had [64] [b] It was in this context that Henry considered his three options for finding a dynastic successor and hence resolving what came to be described at court as the King's \"great matter\" These options were legitimising Henry FitzRoy, which would need the involvement of the Pope and would be open to challenge; marrying off Mary, his daughter with Catherine, as soon as possible and hoping for a grandson to inherit directly, but Mary was considered unlikely to conceive before Henry's death, or somehow rejecting Catherine and marrying someone else of child-bearing age Probably seeing the possibility of marrying Anne, the third was ultimately the most attractive possibility to the 34-year-old Henry, [66] and it soon became the King's absorbing desire to annul his marriage to the now 40-year-old Catherine [67]\n\n\nMarriage to Anne Boleyn\nIn the winter of 1532, Henry met with Francis I at Calais and enlisted Francis's support for his new marriage [80] Immediately upon returning to Dover in England, Henry, now 41, and Anne went through a secret wedding service [81] She soon became pregnant, and there was a second wedding service in London on 25 January 1533 On 23 May 1533, Cranmer, sitting in judgment at a special court convened at Dunstable Priory to rule on the validity of the King's marriage to Catherine of Aragon, declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void Five days later, on 28 May 1533, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be valid [82] Catherine was formally stripped of her title as queen, becoming instead \"princess dowager\" as the widow of Arthur In her place, Anne was crowned queen consort on 1 June 1533 [83] The Queen gave birth to a daughter slightly prematurely on 7 September 1533 The child was christened Elizabeth, in honour of Henry's mother, Elizabeth of York [84]\n\n\nExecution of Anne Boleyn\nOn 8 January 1536, news reached the King and Queen that Catherine of Aragon had died The following day, Henry dressed all in yellow, with a white feather in his bonnet [103] Queen Anne was pregnant again, and she was aware that there might be consequences if she failed to give birth to a son Later that month, the King was thrown from his horse in a tournament and was badly injured; it seemed for a time that his life was in danger When news of this accident reached the Queen, she was sent into shock and miscarried a male child at about 15 weeks' gestation, on the day of Catherine's funeral, 29 January 1536 [104] For most observers, this personal loss was the beginning of the end of this royal marriage [105]\n\n\nMarriage to Jane Seymour; domestic and foreign affairs\nThe day after Anne's execution the 45-year-old Henry became engaged to Seymour, who had been one of the Queen's ladies-in-waiting They were married ten days later [115] at the Palace of Whitehall, Whitehall, London, in Anne's closet, by Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester [116]\n\n\nMarriage to Anne of Cleves\nHaving considered the matter, Cromwell suggested Anne, the 25-year-old sister of the Duke of Cleves, who was seen as an important ally in case of a Roman Catholic attack on England, for the Duke fell between Lutheranism and Catholicism [125] Other potential brides included Christina of Denmark, Anna of Lorraine, Louise of Guise and Amalia of Cleves Hans Holbein the Younger was dispatched to Cleves to paint a portrait of Anne for the King [126] Despite speculation that Holbein painted her in an overly flattering light, it is more likely that the portrait was accurate; Holbein remained in favour at court [127] After seeing Holbein's portrait, and urged on by the complimentary description of Anne given by his courtiers, the 49-year-old King agreed to wed Anne [128]\n\n\nMarriage to Catherine Howard (and fall of Thomas Cromwell)\nIt was soon clear that Henry had fallen for the 17-year-old Catherine Howard, the Duke of Norfolk's niece This worried Cromwell, for Norfolk was his political opponent [134]\n\n\nMarriage to Catherine Parr\nHenry married his last wife, the wealthy widow Catherine Parr, in July 1543 [143] A reformer at heart, she argued with Henry over religion Henry remained committed to an idiosyncratic mixture of Catholicism and Protestantism; the reactionary mood that had gained ground after Cromwell's fall had neither eliminated his Protestant streak nor been overcome by it [144] Parr helped reconcile Henry with his daughters, Mary and Elizabeth [145] In 1543, the Third Succession Act put them back in the line of succession after Edward The same act allowed Henry to determine further succession to the throne in his will [146]\n\n\nShrines destroyed and monasteries dissolved\nIn 1538, the chief minister Thomas Cromwell pursued an extensive campaign against what the government termed \"idolatry\" practised under the old religion, culminating in September with the dismantling of the shrine of St Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral As a consequence, the King was excommunicated by Pope Paul III on 17 December of the same year [94] In 1540, Henry sanctioned the complete destruction of shrines to saints In 1542, England's remaining monasteries were all dissolved, and their property transferred to the Crown Abbots and priors lost their seats in the House of Lords Consequently, the Lords Spiritual – as members of the clergy with seats in the House of Lords were known – were for the first time outnumbered by the Lords Temporal [147]\n\n\nSecond invasion of France and the \"Rough Wooing\" of Scotland\nThe 1539 alliance between Francis and Charles had soured, eventually degenerating into renewed war With Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn dead, relations between Charles and Henry improved considerably, and Henry concluded a secret alliance with the Emperor and decided to enter the Italian War in favour of his new ally An invasion of France was planned for 1543 [148] In preparation for it, Henry moved to eliminate the potential threat of Scotland under his young nephew, James V The Scots were defeated at Battle of Solway Moss on 24 November 1542, [149] and James died on 15 December Henry now hoped to unite the crowns of England and Scotland by marrying his son Edward to James's successor, Mary The Scottish regent Lord Arran agreed to the marriage in the Treaty of Greenwich on 1 July 1543, but it was rejected by the Parliament of Scotland on 11 December The result was eight years of war between England and Scotland, a campaign later dubbed \"the Rough Wooing\" Despite several peace treaties, unrest continued in Scotland until Henry's death [150] [151] [152]\n\n\nPhysical decline and death\nLate in life, Henry became obese, with a waist measurement of 54 inches (140 cm), and had to be moved about with the help of mechanical devices He was covered with painful, pus-filled boils and possibly had gout His obesity and other medical problems can be traced to the jousting accident on 24 January 1536 in which he suffered a leg wound The accident reopened and aggravated an injury he had sustained years earlier, to the extent that his doctors found it difficult to treat The chronic wound festered for the remainder of his life and became ulcerated, preventing him from maintaining the level of physical activity he had previously enjoyed The jousting accident is also believed to have caused Henry's mood swings, which may have had a dramatic effect on his personality and temperament [154] [155] [156]\n\n\nWives, mistresses, and children\nEnglish historian and House of Tudor expert David Starkey describes Henry VIII as follows:\n\n\nSuccession\nUpon Henry's death, he was succeeded by his only surviving son, Edward VI Since Edward was then only nine years old, he could not rule directly Instead, Henry's will designated 16 executors to serve on a regency council until Edward reached 18 The executors chose Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford, elder brother to Jane Seymour (Edward's mother), to be Lord Protector of the Realm Under provisions of the will, if Edward died childless, the throne was to pass to Mary, Henry VIII's daughter by Catherine of Aragon, and her heirs.\n\n\nPublic image\nHenry cultivated the image of a Renaissance man, and his court was a centre of scholarly and artistic innovation and glamorous excess, epitomised by the Field of the Cloth of Gold He scouted the country for choirboys, taking some directly from Wolsey's choir, and introduced Renaissance music into court Musicians included Benedict de Opitiis, Richard Sampson, Ambrose Lupo, and Venetian organist Dionisio Memo, [169] and Henry himself kept a considerable collection of instruments He was skilled on the lute and played the organ, and was a talented player of the virginals [169] He could also sightread music and sing well [169] He was an accomplished musician, author, and poet; his best-known piece of music is \"Pastime with Good Company\" (\"The Kynges Ballade\"), and he is reputed to have written \"Greensleeves\" but probably did not [170]\n\n\nGovernment\nThe power of Tudor monarchs, including Henry, was 'whole' and 'entire', ruling, as they claimed, by the grace of God alone [178] The crown could also rely on the exclusive use of those functions that constituted the royal prerogative These included acts of diplomacy (including royal marriages), declarations of war, management of the coinage, the issue of royal pardons and the power to summon and dissolve Parliament as and when required [179] Nevertheless, as evident during Henry's break with Rome, the monarch stayed within established limits, whether legal or financial, that forced him to work closely with both the nobility and Parliament (representing the gentry) [179]\n\n\nFinances\nHenry inherited a vast fortune and a prosperous economy from his father, who had been frugal This fortune is estimated at £1,250,000 (the equivalent of £375 million today) [199] By comparison, Henry VIII's reign was a near disaster financially He augmented the royal treasury by seizing church lands, but his heavy spending and long periods of mismanagement damaged the economy [200]\n\n\nReformation\nHenry is generally credited with initiating the English Reformation – the process of transforming England from a Catholic country to a Protestant one – though his progress at the elite and mass levels is disputed, [206] and the precise narrative not widely agreed upon [68] Certainly, in 1527, Henry, until then an observant and well-informed Catholic, appealed to the Pope for an annulment of his marriage to Catherine [68] No annulment was immediately forthcoming, since the papacy was now under the control of Charles V, Catherine's nephew [207] The traditional narrative gives this refusal as the trigger for Henry's rejection of papal supremacy, which he had previously defended Yet as E L Woodward put it, Henry's determination to annul his marriage with Catherine was the occasion rather than the cause of the English Reformation so that \"neither too much nor too little\" should be made of the annulment [208] Historian A F Pollard has argued that even if Henry had not needed an annulment, he might have come to reject papal control over the governance of England purely for political reasons Indeed, Henry needed a son to secure the Tudor Dynasty and avert the risk of civil war over disputed succession [209]\n\n\nMilitary\nApart from permanent garrisons at Berwick, Calais, and Carlisle, England's standing army numbered only a few hundred men This was increased only slightly by Henry [230] Henry's invasion force of 1513, some 30,000 men, was composed of billmen and longbowmen, at a time when the other European nations were moving to hand guns and pikemen but the difference in capability was at this stage not significant, and Henry's forces had new armour and weaponry They were also supported by battlefield artillery and the war wagon, [231] relatively new innovations, and several large and expensive siege guns [232] The invasion force of 1544 was similarly well-equipped and organised, although command on the battlefield was laid with the dukes of Suffolk and Norfolk, which in the latter case produced disastrous results at Montreuil [150]\n\n\nIreland\nAt the beginning of Henry's reign, Ireland was effectively divided into three zones: the Pale, where English rule was unchallenged;

He is best known for his tumultuous marriages, his conflicts with the Catholic Church, and his role in the English Reformation. Henry's reign was marked by significant events, including the establishment of the Church of England, the execution of two of his wives, and the dissolution of the monasteries.\n\n**Early Years**\n\nBorn on 28 June 1491 at the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich, Kent, Henry Tudor was the third child and second son of King Henry VII and Elizabeth of York. Of the young Henry's six (or seven) siblings, only three – his brother Arthur, Prince of Wales, and sisters Margaret and Mary – survived infancy. He was baptised by Richard Foxe, the Bishop of Exeter, at a church of the Observant Franciscans close to the palace.\n\nIn 1493, at the age of two, Henry was appointed Constable of Dover Castle and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. He was subsequently appointed Earl Marshal of England and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland at age three and was made a Knight of the Bath soon after. The day after the ceremony, he was created Duke of York and a month or so later made Warden of the Scottish Marches. In May 1495, he was appointed to the Order of the Garter.\n\nNot much is known about Henry's early life – save for his appointments – because he was not expected to become king. However, it is known that he received a first-rate education from leading tutors. He became fluent in Latin and French and learned at least some Italian.\n\n**Early Reign**\n\nHenry VII died in April 1509, and the 17-year-old Henry succeeded him as king. Soon after his father's burial on 10 May, Henry suddenly declared that he would indeed marry Catherine, leaving unresolved several issues concerning the papal dispensation and a missing part of the marriage portion. The new king maintained that it had been his father's dying wish that he marry Catherine. Whether or not this was true, it was convenient Emperor Maximilian I had been attempting to marry his granddaughter Eleanor, Catherine's niece, to Henry; she had now been jilted.\n\nHenry's wedding to Catherine was kept low-key and was held at the friars' church in Greenwich on 11 June 1509. Henry claimed descent from Constantine the Great and King Arthur and saw himself as their successor.\n\n**France and the Habsburgs**\n\nIn 1510, France, with a fragile alliance with the Holy Roman Empire in the League of Cambrai, was winning a war against Venice. Henry renewed his father's friendship with Louis XII of France, an issue that divided his council. Certainly, war with the combined might of the two powers would have been exceedingly difficult. Shortly thereafter, however, Henry also signed a pact with Ferdinand II of Aragon. After Pope Julius II created the anti-French Holy League in October 1511, Henry followed Ferdinand's lead and brought England into the new League. An initial joint Anglo-Spanish attack was planned for the spring to recover Aquitaine for England, the start of making Henry's dreams of ruling France a reality.\n\n**Marriages**\n\nKing Henry VIII and all six of his wives were related through a common ancestor, King Edward I of England. The King's marriages were often tumultuous, with some ending in divorce and others in the execution of the wife.\n\nHenry's first marriage was to Catherine of Aragon, which ended in divorce. He then married Anne Boleyn, who was beheaded on charges of adultery, incest, and treason. Henry's third marriage was to Jane Seymour, who died soon after giving birth to a son, Edward VI. His fourth marriage was to Anne of Cleves, which was annulled after a few months. His fifth marriage was to Catherine Howard, who was also beheaded on charges of adultery and treason. His sixth and final marriage was to Catherine Parr, who survived him.\n\n**Marriage to Anne Boleyn**\n\nIn the winter of 1532, Henry met with Francis I at Calais and enlisted Francis's support for his new marriage. Immediately upon returning to Dover in England, Henry, now 41, and Anne went through a secret wedding service. She soon became pregnant, and there was a second wedding service in London on 25 January 1533. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer, sitting in judgment at a special court convened at Dunstable Priory to rule on the validity of the King's marriage to Catherine of Aragon, declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void. Five days later, on 28 May 1533, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be valid. Catherine was formally stripped of her title as queen, becoming instead \"princess dowager\" as the widow of Arthur. In her place, Anne was crowned queen consort on 1 June 1533.\n\n**Execution of Anne Boleyn**\n\nOn 8 January 1536, news reached the King and Queen that Catherine of Aragon had died. The following day, Henry dressed all in yellow, with a white feather in his bonnet. Queen Anne was pregnant again, and she was aware that there might be consequences if she failed to give birth to a son. Later that month, the King was thrown from his horse in a tournament and was badly injured; it seemed for a time that his life was in danger. When news of this accident reached the Queen, she was sent into shock and miscarried a male child at about 15 weeks' gestation, on the day of Catherine's funeral, 29 January 1536.\n\n**Marriage to Jane Seymour**\n\nThe day after Anne's execution, the 45-year-old Henry became engaged to Jane Seymour, who had been one of the Queen's ladies-in-waiting. They were married ten days later at the Palace of Whitehall, Whitehall, London, in Anne's closet, by Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester.\n\n**Marriage to Anne of Cleves**\n\nHaving considered the matter, Cromwell suggested Anne, the 25-year-old sister of the Duke of Cleves, who was seen as an important ally in case of a Roman Catholic attack on England, for the Duke fell between Lutheranism and Catholicism. Other potential brides included Christina of Denmark, Anna of Lorraine, Louise of Guise, and Amalia of Cleves. Hans Holbein the Younger was dispatched to Cleves to paint a portrait of Anne for the King. Despite speculation that Holbein painted her in an overly flattering light, it is more likely that the portrait was accurate; Holbein remained in favour at court.\n\n**Marriage to Catherine Howard**\n\nIt was soon clear that Henry had fallen for the 17-year-old Catherine Howard, the Duke of Norfolk's niece. This worried Cromwell, for Norfolk was his political opponent.\n\n**Marriage to Catherine Parr**\n\nHenry married his last wife, the wealthy widow Catherine Parr, in July 1543. A reformer at heart, she argued with Henry over religion. Henry remained committed to an idiosyncratic mixture of Catholicism and Protestantism; the reactionary mood that had gained ground after Cromwell's fall had neither eliminated his Protestant streak nor been overcome by it. Parr helped reconcile Henry with his daughters, Mary and Elizabeth.\n\n**Shrines destroyed and monasteries dissolved**\n\nIn 1538, the chief minister Thomas Cromwell pursued an extensive campaign against what the government termed \"idolatry\" practised under the old religion, culminating in September with the dismantling of the shrine of St Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral. As a consequence, the King was excommunicated by Pope Paul III on 17 December of the same year. In 1540, Henry sanctioned the complete destruction of shrines to saints. In 1542, England's remaining monasteries were all dissolved, and their property transferred to the Crown. Abbots and priors lost their seats in the House of Lords. Consequently, the Lords Spiritual – as members of the clergy with seats in the House of Lords were known – were for the first time outnumbered by the Lords Temporal.\n\n**Second invasion of France and the \"Rough Wooing\" of Scotland**\n\nThe 1539 alliance between Francis and Charles had soured, eventually degenerating into renewed war. With Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn dead, relations between Charles and Henry improved considerably, and Henry concluded a secret alliance with the Emperor and decided to enter the Italian War in favour of his new ally. An invasion of France was planned for 1543.\n\n**Physical decline and death**\n\nLate in life, Henry became obese, with a waist measurement of 54 inches (140 cm), and had to be moved about with the help of mechanical devices. He was covered with painful, pus-filled boils and possibly had gout. His obesity and other medical problems can be traced to the jousting accident on 24 January 1536 in which he suffered a leg wound. The accident reopened and aggravated an injury he had sustained years earlier, to the extent that his doctors found it difficult to treat.\n\n**Wives, mistresses, and children**\n\nEnglish historian and House of Tudor expert David Starkey describes Henry VIII as follows:\n\nHenry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon produced one daughter, Mary; his marriage to Anne Boleyn produced one daughter, Elizabeth; his marriage to Jane Seymour produced one son, Edward; and his marriage to Anne of Cleves produced no children. His marriage to Catherine Howard produced no children, and his marriage to Catherine Parr produced no children.\n\n**Succession**\n\nUpon Henry's death, he was succeeded by his only surviving son, Edward VI. Since Edward was then only nine years old, he could not rule directly. Instead, Henry's will designated 16 executors to serve on a regency council until Edward reached 18. The executors chose Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford, elder brother to Jane Seymour (Edward's mother), to be Lord Protector of the Realm. Under provisions of the will, if Edward died childless, the throne was to pass to Mary, Henry VIII's daughter by Catherine of Aragon, and her heirs.\n\n**Public image**\n\nHenry cultivated the image of a Renaissance man, and his court was a centre of scholarly and artistic innovation and glamorous excess, epitomised by the Field of the Cloth of Gold. He scouted the country for choirboys, taking some directly from Wolsey's choir, and introduced Renaissance music into court. Musicians included Benedict de Opitiis, Richard Sampson, Ambrose Lupo, and Venetian organist Dionisio Memo, and Henry himself kept a considerable collection of instruments. He was skilled on the lute and played the organ, and was a talented player of the virginals. He could also sightread music and sing well. He was an accomplished musician, author, and poet; his best-known piece of music is \"Pastime with Good Company\" (\"The King's Ballade\"), and he is reputed to have written \"Greensleeves\" but probably did not.\n\n**Government**\n\nThe power of Tudor monarchs, including Henry, was 'whole' and 'entire', ruling, as they claimed, by the grace of God alone. The crown could also rely on the exclusive use of those functions that constituted the royal prerogative. These included acts of diplomacy (including royal marriages), declarations of war, management of the coinage, the issue of royal pardons, and the power to summon and dissolve Parliament as and when required. Nevertheless, as evident during Henry's break with Rome, the monarch stayed within established limits, whether legal or financial, that forced him to work closely with both the nobility and Parliament (representing the gentry).\n\n**Finances**\n\nHenry inherited a vast fortune and a prosperous economy from his father, who had been frugal. This fortune is estimated at £1,250,000 (the equivalent of £375 million today). By comparison, Henry VIII's reign was a near disaster financially. He augmented the royal treasury by seizing church lands, but his heavy spending and long periods of mismanagement damaged the economy.\n\n**Reformation**\n\nHenry is generally credited with initiating the English Reformation – the process of transforming England from a Catholic country to a Protestant one – though his progress at the elite and mass levels is disputed, and the precise narrative not widely agreed upon. Certainly, in 1527, Henry, until then an observant and well-informed Catholic, appealed to the Pope for an annulment of his marriage to Catherine. No annulment was immediately forthcoming, since the papacy was now under the control of Charles V, Catherine's nephew. The traditional narrative gives this refusal as the trigger for Henry's rejection of papal supremacy, which he had previously defended. Yet as E L Woodward put it, Henry's determination to annul his marriage with Catherine was the occasion rather than the cause of the English Reformation so that \"neither too much nor too little\" should be made of the annulment. Historian A F Pollard has argued that even if Henry had not needed an annulment, he might have come to reject papal control over the governance of England purely for political reasons. Indeed, Henry needed a son to secure the Tudor Dynasty and avert the risk of civil war over disputed succession.\n\n**Military**\n\nApart from permanent garrisons at Berwick, Calais, and Carlisle, England's standing army numbered only a few hundred men. This was increased only slightly by Henry. Henry's invasion force of 1513, some 30,000 men, was composed of billmen and longbowmen, at a time when the other European nations were moving to hand guns and pikemen but the difference in capability was at this stage not significant, and Henry's forces had new armour and weaponry. They were also supported by battlefield artillery and the war wagon, relatively new innovations, and several large and expensive siege guns. The invasion force of 1544 was similarly well-equipped and organised, although command on the battlefield was laid with the dukes of Suffolk and Norfolk, which in the latter case produced disastrous results at Montreuil.\n\n**Ireland**\n\nAt the beginning of Henry's reign, Ireland was effectively divided into three zones: the Pale, where English rule was unchallenged; Leinster and Munster, the so-called \"obedient land\" of Anglo-Irish peers; and the Gaelic Connaught and Ulster, with merely nominal English rule. Until 1513, Henry continued the policy of his father, to allow Irish lords to rule in the King's name and accept steep divisions between the communities. However, upon the death of the 8th Earl of Kildare, governor of Ireland, fractious Irish politics combined with a more ambitious Henry to cause trouble. When Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond, died, Henry recognised one successor for Ormond's English, Welsh and Scottish lands, whilst in Ireland another took control. Kildare's successor, the 9th Earl, was replaced as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland by the Earl of Surrey in 1520. Surrey's ambitious aims were costly but ineffective; English rule became trapped between winning the Irish lords over with diplomacy, as favoured by Henry and Wolsey, and a sweeping military occupation as proposed by Surrey. Surrey was recalled in 1521, with Piers Butler – one of the claimants to the Earldom of Ormond – appointed in his place. Butler proved unable to control opposition, including that of Kildare. Kildare was appointed chief governor in 1524, resuming his dispute with Butler, which had before been in a lull. Meanwhile, the Earl of Desmond, an Anglo-Irish peer, had turned his support to Richard de la Pole as pretender to the English throne; when in 1528 Kildare failed to take suitable actions against him, Kildare was once again removed from his post.\n\n**Historiography**\n\nHenry VIII's reign has been the subject of numerous historical studies and interpretations. Some historians have portrayed him as a tyrant and a monster, while others have seen him as a strong and effective leader who played a crucial role in shaping English history. The popular image of Henry VIII as a fat, tyrannical king has been perpetuated by literature and film, including Shakespeare's play \"Henry VIII\" and the 1970 film \"A Man for All Seasons\".\n\n**Style and arms**\n\nMany changes were made to the royal style during Henry's reign. Henry originally used the style \"Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of God, King of England, France and Lord of Ireland\". In 1521, pursuant to a grant from Pope Leo X rewarding Henry for his Defence of the Seven Sacraments, the royal style became \"Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of God, King of England and France, Defender of the Faith and Lord of Ireland\". Following Henry's excommunication, Pope Paul III rescinded the grant of the title \"Defender of the Faith\", but an Act of Parliament (35 Hen 8 c 3) declared that it remained valid; and it continues in royal usage to the present day, as evidenced by the letters FID DEF or F.D on all British coinage. Henry's motto was \"Coeur Loyal\" (\"true heart\"), and he had this embroidered on his clothes in the form of a heart symbol and with the word \"loyal\". His emblem was the Tudor rose and the Beaufort portcullis. As king, Henry's arms were the same as those used by his predecessors since Henry IV: Quarterly, Azure three fleurs-de-lys Or (for France) and Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England).\n\n**Genealogical table**\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | Eleanor Butler, Countess of Ormond (1487–1539) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Henry_VIII\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly years\nBorn on 28 June 1491 at the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich, Kent, Henry Tudor was the third child and second son of King Henry VII and Elizabeth of York [7] Of the young Henry's six (or seven) siblings, only three – his brother Arthur, Prince of Wales, and sisters Margaret and Mary – survived infancy [8] He was baptised by Richard Foxe, the Bishop of Exeter, at a church of the Observant Franciscans close to the palace [9] In 1493, at the age of two, Henry was appointed Constable of Dover Castle and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports He was subsequently appointed Earl Marshal of England and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland at age three and was made a Knight of the Bath soon after The day after the ceremony, he was created Duke of York and a month or so later made Warden of the Scottish Marches In May 1495, he was appointed to the Order of the Garter The reason for giving such appointments to a small child was to enable his father to retain personal control of lucrative positions and not share them with established families [9] Not much is known about Henry's early life – save for his appointments – because he was not expected to become king, [9] but it is known that he received a first-rate education from leading tutors He became fluent in Latin and French and learned at least some Italian [10] [11]\n\n\nEarly reign\nHenry VII died in April 1509, and the 17-year-old Henry succeeded him as king [21] Soon after his father's burial on 10 May, Henry suddenly declared that he would indeed marry Catherine, leaving unresolved several issues concerning the papal dispensation and a missing part of the marriage portion [18] [22] The new king maintained that it had been his father's dying wish that he marry Catherine [20] Whether or not this was true, it was convenient Emperor Maximilian I had been attempting to marry his granddaughter Eleanor, Catherine's niece, to Henry;

Ferdinand used it simply to further his own ends, and it strained the Anglo-Spanish alliance Nevertheless, the French were pushed out of Italy soon after, and the alliance survived, with both parties keen to win further victories over the French [43] [44] Henry then pulled off a diplomatic coup by convincing Emperor Maximilian to join the Holy League [45] Remarkably, Henry had secured the promised title of \"Most Christian King of France\" from Julius and possibly coronation by the Pope himself in Paris, if only Louis could be defeated [46]\n\n\nMarriages\nKing Henry VIII and all six of his wives were related through a common ancestor, King Edward I of England [57]\n\n\nAnnulment from Catherine\nDuring his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, Henry conducted an affair with Mary Boleyn, Catherine's lady-in-waiting There has been speculation that Mary's two children, Henry Carey and Catherine Carey, were fathered by Henry but this has never been proven King Henry never acknowledged them as he did in the case of Henry FitzRoy [60] In 1525, as Henry grew more impatient with Catherine's inability to produce the male heir he desired, [61] [62] he became enamoured of Mary Boleyn's sister, Anne Boleyn, then a charismatic young woman of 25 in the Queen's entourage [63] Anne, however, resisted his attempts to seduce her, and refused to become his mistress as her sister had [64] [b] It was in this context that Henry considered his three options for finding a dynastic successor and hence resolving what came to be described at court as the King's \"great matter\" These options were legitimising Henry FitzRoy, which would need the involvement of the Pope and would be open to challenge; marrying off Mary, his daughter with Catherine, as soon as possible and hoping for a grandson to inherit directly, but Mary was considered unlikely to conceive before Henry's death, or somehow rejecting Catherine and marrying someone else of child-bearing age Probably seeing the possibility of marrying Anne, the third was ultimately the most attractive possibility to the 34-year-old Henry, [66] and it soon became the King's absorbing desire to annul his marriage to the now 40-year-old Catherine [67]\n\n\nMarriage to Anne Boleyn\nIn the winter of 1532, Henry met with Francis I at Calais and enlisted Francis's support for his new marriage [80] Immediately upon returning to Dover in England, Henry, now 41, and Anne went through a secret wedding service [81] She soon became pregnant, and there was a second wedding service in London on 25 January 1533 On 23 May 1533, Cranmer, sitting in judgment at a special court convened at Dunstable Priory to rule on the validity of the King's marriage to Catherine of Aragon, declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void Five days later, on 28 May 1533, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be valid [82] Catherine was formally stripped of her title as queen, becoming instead \"princess dowager\" as the widow of Arthur In her place, Anne was crowned queen consort on 1 June 1533 [83] The Queen gave birth to a daughter slightly prematurely on 7 September 1533 The child was christened Elizabeth, in honour of Henry's mother, Elizabeth of York [84]\n\n\nExecution of Anne Boleyn\nOn 8 January 1536, news reached the King and Queen that Catherine of Aragon had died The following day, Henry dressed all in yellow, with a white feather in his bonnet [103] Queen Anne was pregnant again, and she was aware that there might be consequences if she failed to give birth to a son Later that month, the King was thrown from his horse in a tournament and was badly injured;

the reactionary mood that had gained ground after Cromwell's fall had neither eliminated his Protestant streak nor been overcome by it [144] Parr helped reconcile Henry with his daughters, Mary and Elizabeth [145] In 1543, the Third Succession Act put them back in the line of succession after Edward The same act allowed Henry to determine further succession to the throne in his will [146]\n\n\nShrines destroyed and monasteries dissolved\nIn 1538, the chief minister Thomas Cromwell pursued an extensive campaign against what the government termed \"idolatry\" practised under the old religion, culminating in September with the dismantling of the shrine of St Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral As a consequence, the King was excommunicated by Pope Paul III on 17 December of the same year [94] In 1540, Henry sanctioned the complete destruction of shrines to saints In 1542, England's remaining monasteries were all dissolved, and their property transferred to the Crown Abbots and priors lost their seats in the House of Lords Consequently, the Lords Spiritual – as members of the clergy with seats in the House of Lords were known – were for the first time outnumbered by the Lords Temporal [147]\n\n\nSecond invasion of France and the \"Rough Wooing\" of Scotland\nThe 1539 alliance between Francis and Charles had soured, eventually degenerating into renewed war With Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn dead, relations between Charles and Henry improved considerably, and Henry concluded a secret alliance with the Emperor and decided to enter the Italian War in favour of his new ally An invasion of France was planned for 1543 [148] In preparation for it, Henry moved to eliminate the potential threat of Scotland under his young nephew, James V The Scots were defeated at Battle of Solway Moss on 24 November 1542, [149] and James died on 15 December Henry now hoped to unite the crowns of England and Scotland by marrying his son Edward to James's successor, Mary The Scottish regent Lord Arran agreed to the marriage in the Treaty of Greenwich on 1 July 1543, but it was rejected by the Parliament of Scotland on 11 December The result was eight years of war between England and Scotland, a campaign later dubbed \"the Rough Wooing\" Despite several peace treaties, unrest continued in Scotland until Henry's death [150] [151] [152]\n\n\nPhysical decline and death\nLate in life, Henry became obese, with a waist measurement of 54 inches (140 cm), and had to be moved about with the help of mechanical devices He was covered with painful, pus-filled boils and possibly had gout His obesity and other medical problems can be traced to the jousting accident on 24 January 1536 in which he suffered a leg wound The accident reopened and aggravated an injury he had sustained years earlier, to the extent that his doctors found it difficult to treat The chronic wound festered for the remainder of his life and became ulcerated, preventing him from maintaining the level of physical activity he had previously enjoyed The jousting accident is also believed to have caused Henry's mood swings, which may have had a dramatic effect on his personality and temperament [154] [155] [156]\n\n\nWives, mistresses, and children\nEnglish historian and House of Tudor expert David Starkey describes Henry VIII as follows:\n\n\nSuccession\nUpon Henry's death, he was succeeded by his only surviving son, Edward VI Since Edward was then only nine years old, he could not rule directly Instead, Henry's will designated 16 executors to serve on a regency council until Edward reached 18 The executors chose Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford, elder brother to Jane Seymour (Edward's mother), to be Lord Protector of the Realm Under provisions of the will, if Edward died childless, the throne was to pass to Mary, Henry VIII's daughter by Catherine of Aragon, and her heirs.\n\n\nPublic image\nHenry cultivated the image of a Renaissance man, and his court was a centre of scholarly and artistic innovation and glamorous excess, epitomised by the Field of the Cloth of Gold He scouted the country for choirboys, taking some directly from Wolsey's choir, and introduced Renaissance music into court Musicians included Benedict de Opitiis, Richard Sampson, Ambrose Lupo, and Venetian organist Dionisio Memo, [169] and Henry himself kept a considerable collection of instruments He was skilled on the lute and played the organ, and was a talented player of the virginals [169] He could also sightread music and sing well [169] He was an accomplished musician, author, and poet; his best-known piece of music is \"Pastime with Good Company\" (\"The Kynges Ballade\"), and he is reputed to have written \"Greensleeves\" but probably did not [170]\n\n\nGovernment\nThe power of Tudor monarchs, including Henry, was 'whole' and 'entire', ruling, as they claimed, by the grace of God alone [178] The crown could also rely on the exclusive use of those functions that constituted the royal prerogative These included acts of diplomacy (including royal marriages), declarations of war, management of the coinage, the issue of royal pardons and the power to summon and dissolve Parliament as and when required [179] Nevertheless, as evident during Henry's break with Rome, the monarch stayed within established limits, whether legal or financial, that forced him to work closely with both the nobility and Parliament (representing the gentry) [179]\n\n\nFinances\nHenry inherited a vast fortune and a prosperous economy from his father, who had been frugal This fortune is estimated at £1,250,000 (the equivalent of £375 million today) [199] By comparison, Henry VIII's reign was a near disaster financially He augmented the royal treasury by seizing church lands, but his heavy spending and long periods of mismanagement damaged the economy [200]\n\n\nReformation\nHenry is generally credited with initiating the English Reformation – the process of transforming England from a Catholic country to a Protestant one – though his progress at the elite and mass levels is disputed, [206] and the precise narrative not widely agreed upon [68] Certainly, in 1527, Henry, until then an observant and well-informed Catholic, appealed to the Pope for an annulment of his marriage to Catherine [68] No annulment was immediately forthcoming, since the papacy was now under the control of Charles V, Catherine's nephew [207] The traditional narrative gives this refusal as the trigger for Henry's rejection of papal supremacy, which he had previously defended Yet as E L Woodward put it, Henry's determination to annul his marriage with Catherine was the occasion rather than the cause of the English Reformation so that \"neither too much nor too little\" should be made of the annulment [208] Historian A F Pollard has argued that even if Henry had not needed an annulment, he might have come to reject papal control over the governance of England purely for political reasons Indeed, Henry needed a son to secure the Tudor Dynasty and avert the risk of civil war over disputed succession [209]\n\n\nMilitary\nApart from permanent garrisons at Berwick, Calais, and Carlisle, England's standing army numbered only a few hundred men This was increased only slightly by Henry [230] Henry's invasion force of 1513, some 30,000 men, was composed of billmen and longbowmen, at a time when the other European nations were moving to hand guns and pikemen but the difference in capability was at this stage not significant, and Henry's forces had new armour and weaponry They were also supported by battlefield artillery and the war wagon, [231] relatively new innovations, and several large and expensive siege guns [232] The invasion force of 1544 was similarly well-equipped and organised, although command on the battlefield was laid with the dukes of Suffolk and Norfolk, which in the latter case produced disastrous results at Montreuil [150]\n\n\nIreland\nAt the beginning of Henry's reign, Ireland was effectively divided into three zones: the Pale, where English rule was unchallenged; Leinster and Munster, the so-called \"obedient land\" of Anglo-Irish peers; and the Gaelic Connaught and Ulster, with merely nominal English rule [241] Until 1513, Henry continued the policy of his father, to allow Irish lords to rule in the King's name and accept steep divisions between the communities [242] However, upon the death of the 8th Earl of Kildare, governor of Ireland, fractious Irish politics combined with a more ambitious Henry to cause trouble When Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond, died, Henry recognised one successor for Ormond's English, Welsh and Scottish lands, whilst in Ireland another took control Kildare's successor, the 9th Earl, was replaced as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland by the Earl of Surrey in 1520 [243] Surrey's ambitious aims were costly but ineffective; English rule became trapped between winning the Irish lords over with diplomacy, as favoured by Henry and Wolsey, and a sweeping military occupation as proposed by Surrey [244] Surrey was recalled in 1521, with Piers Butler – one of the claimants to the Earldom of Ormond – appointed in his place Butler proved unable to control opposition, including that of Kildare Kildare was appointed chief governor in 1524, resuming his dispute with Butler, which had before been in a lull Meanwhile, the Earl of Desmond, an Anglo-Irish peer, had turned his support to Richard de la Pole as pretender to the English throne; when in 1528 Kildare failed to take suitable actions against him, Kildare was once again removed from his post [245]\n\n\nHistoriography\n\n\nStyle and arms\nMany changes were made to the royal style during his reign Henry originally used the style \"Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of God, King of England, France and Lord of Ireland\" In 1521, pursuant to a grant from Pope Leo X rewarding Henry for his Defence of the Seven Sacraments, the royal style became \"Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of God, King of England and France, Defender of the Faith and Lord of Ireland\" Following Henry's excommunication, Pope Paul III rescinded the grant of the title \"Defender of the Faith\", but an Act of Parliament (35 Hen 8 c 3) declared that it remained valid; and it continues in royal usage to the present day, as evidenced by the letters FID DEF or F.D on all British coinage Henry's motto was \"Coeur Loyal\" (\"true heart\"), and he had this embroidered on his clothes in the form of a heart symbol and with the word \"loyal\" His emblem was the Tudor rose and the Beaufort portcullis As king, Henry's arms were the same as those used by his predecessors since Henry IV: Quarterly, Azure three fleurs-de-lys Or (for France) and Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England).\n\n\nGenealogical table\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

There weren't mass murders as it's been said.\" [88] He was eventually condemned under the Gayssot Act to pay 1.2 million francs (€183,200) [89]\n\n\nOther legal problems and allegations\nLe Pen is often nicknamed the \"Menhir\", due to his \"granitic nature\" as he is perceived as someone who does not give way to pressure or who cannot be easily knocked down It also connects him to France's Celtic origins [105] Le Pen is often described as one of the most flamboyant and charismatic orators in Europe, whose speech blends folksy humour, crude attacks and rhetorical finesse [105] [106] [107] [108]\n\n\nPublic image\nLe Pen is often nicknamed the \"Menhir\", due to his \"granitic nature\" as he is perceived as someone who does not give way to pressure or who cannot be easily knocked down It also connects him to France's Celtic origins [105] Le Pen is often described as one of the most flamboyant and charismatic orators in Europe, whose speech blends folksy humour, crude attacks and rhetorical finesse [105] [106] [107] [108]\n\n\nPublic perception\nLe Pen is often nicknamed the \"Menhir\", due to his \"granitic nature\" as he is perceived as someone who does not give way to pressure or who cannot be easily knocked down It also connects him to France's Celtic origins [105] Le Pen is often described as one of the most flamboyant and charismatic orators in Europe, whose speech blends folksy humour, crude attacks and rhetorical finesse [105] [106] [107] [108]\n\n\nRelations with other groups\nSome of Le Pen's statements led other far-right groups, such as the Austrian Freedom Party, [113] and some National Front supporters, to distance themselves from him Controversial Dutch anti-Islam lawmaker Geert Wilders, who has often been accused of being far-right, has also criticized Le Pen [114] Bruno Mégret left the National Front to found his own party (the National Republican Movement, MNR), claiming that Le Pen kept the Front away from the possibility of gaining power Mégret wanted to emulate Gianfranco Fini's success in Italy by making it possible for right-wing parties to ally themselves with the Front, but claimed that Le Pen's attitude and outrageous speech prevented this Le Pen's daughter Marine leads an internal movement of the Front that wants to \"normalize\" the National Front, \"de-enclave\" it, have a \"culture of government\" etc.; however, relations with Le Pen and other supporters of the hard line are complex [115] Le Pen's National Front electoral successes along with the party gaining wider public prominence led to suggestions for the renewal of the pan-European alliance of extreme-right parties with Le Pen as its figurehead, [116] a suggestion that eventually did indeed bring about the establishment of the Europe of Nations and Freedom group in the European Parliament, chaired by Le Pen's daughter Marine.\n\n\nDecorations\nNews articles and videos\n\n\nElectoral history\nNews articles and videos\n\n\nPresidential\nNews articles and videos\n\n\nSee also\nNews articles and videos\n\n\nReferences\nNews articles and videos\n\n\nFurther reading\nNews articles and videos\n\n\nExternal links\nNews articles and videos\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Charles_Henry_Allan_Bennett", "content": "\nEarly life\nAllan Bennett was born in London on 8 December 1872,  [7] [8] his full name at birth was Charles Henry Allan Bennett His only sister, Charlotte Louise was born in Brighton about a year before [9] His childhood was difficult and filled with suffering His father died when he was still a boy, and his mother struggled to support the family, who nevertheless raised him as a strict Roman Catholic  [10] [11] [12] [13] During his youth he was plagued with bouts of acute asthma, which were debilitating even for weeks at a time [9] [14]\n\n\nSearch for spiritual truth\nHaving left Catholicism in his teens, Bennett was still in search to fill the void that had formed from this parting as he ever wished to find his place in the spiritual spectrum [14] Having a heart and intellect that sought cause and effect, analytical knowledge and wisdom, he wanted to apply scientific analysis to religion and uncover true spiritual gnosis When Bennett was eighteen he fell in love with Sir Edwin Arnolds' book The Light of Asia (1879), which at the time was said to cause \"an enormous upsurge in awareness of, and interest in, Buddhism\" [16] [28] [3] This was a real turning point in Bennett's life, and made a revolutionary impression that lasted his lifetime [29] [30] [31] [14] He was so deeply moved by the pure and rational faith experienced through Arnold's poetry This religious experience lead the way for Bennett to develop a closer association with the existing English translations of Buddhist Scriptures [31] [16] Thus at this tender age of eighteen, having been inspired by The Light of Asia, Bennett announced himself a Buddhist by Faith  [32] [16] [8]\n\n\nGolden Dawn\nBennett was initiated into the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in 1894, [39] taking the Latin motto \"Voco\", (\"I Invoke\") [40] He quickly progressed through the grades, entering the Second Order as a 5=6 on 22 March 1895 and taking the Hebrew motto \"Iehi Aour\", (\"let there be light\") [40] [41] [42] [5] He was always very poor and tormented by illness, but still made a strong impression on other occultists of the time [43] Bennett was one of the most luminous minds in the order [44] [45] [31] [14] and favoured mysticism and white magic rather than the occult  [3] [46] Bennett was almost wholly concerned with divine knowledge and enlightenment rather than siddhis (magical powers) seeing them as mundane and divorced from the unrealised but glimpsed heights of spiritual attainment [36] [46] [25]\n\n\nDawn of the esoteric\nBennett was initiated into the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in 1894, [39] taking the Latin motto \"Voco\", (\"I Invoke\") [40] He quickly progressed through the grades, entering the Second Order as a 5=6 on 22 March 1895 and taking the Hebrew motto \"Iehi Aour\", (\"let there be light\") [40] [41] [42] [5] He was always very poor and tormented by illness, but still made a strong impression on other occultists of the time [43] Bennett was one of the most luminous minds in the order [44] [45] [31] [14] and favoured mysticism and white magic rather than the occult  [3] [46] Bennett was almost wholly concerned with divine knowledge and enlightenment rather than siddhis (magical powers) seeing them as mundane and divorced from the unrealised but glimpsed heights of spiritual attainment [36] [46] [25]\n\n\nPoverty, chronic sickness, and accessing mysteries\nSoon after the meeting, Crowley was shocked to find that Bennett was living in a dilapidated apartment in the slums south of the Thames with another Brother of the Order Crowley, deeply impressed with the man also pitying his situation, invited Bennett to come stay with him, now enabling the two light seekers to work together more fluently [57] Crowley organised a room for him in his Chancery Lane flat, \"and settled down to pick his brains\", for he knew his reputation \"as the one magician who could really do big-time stuff\" [25] For days, weeks and months, Bennett trained Crowley in the basics of magic [69] and tried to instill a devotion to white magic [70] Bennett was generally ascetic and reputedly sexually chaste, a marked contrast to Crowley's libertine attitude [71] In a fictional work Crowley depicts Bennett's disposition towards chastity stating \"He had an aversion to all such matters amounting to horror.\" [23] Even though all early sources point to Bennett's chastity, unfounded rumours seem to of circulated in later years in an attempt to smear Crowley Israel Regardie, who was a personal secretary of Crowley's for a time, agrees the rumours seem to be baseless, that he never heard anything from Crowley or any substantiated claim to suggest otherwise [72] [60] [73] Crowley had said of him \"We called him the White Knight\", that there \"never walked a whiter man on earth\" that he was a harmless, lovable \"terribly frustrated genius\" [25]\n\n\nImpact, influence, and change of view\nIn a hallowing scene Bennett is described as \"calm, majestic, clearly master of it all\", Crowley paints in detail the aura of the man, that thunders forth; \"instantly a ray of divine brilliance cleaves the black clouds above his head, and his noble countenance flashing in that ecstasy of brightness.\" [83] Crowley stating how this picture of Bennett was the literal truth That Bennett was one of the very few people that he had met \"who really could get .. the results they wished for\" in this esoteric field, for it is easy for most to get unwished for results \"madness, death, marriage\" [83]\n\n\nTravel to Southeast Asia\nAt some time between 1889 and 1900, in his late twenties, Bennett traveled to Asia [100] [101] [102] to relieve his chronic asthma, after submersing himself in the study Buddhism [16] [32] He traveled to Ceylon as a self-converted Buddhist, staying at Kamburugamuwa in the Matara district for four months, Bennett studied the Pali language and the root Theravadan Teachings under an elder Sinhala monk Venerable Revata Thera [17] [3] Cassius Pereira later recalled that \"such was the brilliance of his intellect\" that he had mastered that ancient tongue in six months and could fluently converse.\" [103] [104] Further that Bennett \"made many close friends amongst the Buddhists of Ceylon, who gave him much assistance in every way.\" [104] Bennett also spent time visiting monasteries, monks and sacred sites, familiarising and immersing himself with the Buddhist culture and practice of Ceylon  [31]\n\n\nCeylon, yoga and Buddhism\nAt some time between 1889 and 1900, in his late twenties, Bennett traveled to Asia [100] [101] [102] to relieve his chronic asthma, after submersing himself in the study Buddhism [16] [32] He traveled to Ceylon as a self-converted Buddhist, staying at Kamburugamuwa in the Matara district for four months, Bennett studied the Pali language and the root Theravadan Teachings under an elder Sinhala monk Venerable Revata Thera [17] [3] Cassius Pereira later recalled that \"such was the brilliance of his intellect\" that he had mastered that ancient tongue in six months and could fluently converse.\" [103] [104] Further that Bennett \"made many close friends amongst the Buddhists of Ceylon, who gave him much assistance in every way.\" [104] Bennett also spent time visiting monasteries, monks and sacred sites, familiarising and immersing himself with the Buddhist culture and practice of Ceylon  [31]\n\n\nOut of darkness into the light\nBennett travelled to the coastal city of Akyab at took up residence at the Buddhist monastery, the Lamma Sayadaw Kyoung Bennett was accepted into the Order by Lamrna Saradaw as a Samanera (novice monk) on 8 December 1901  [123] [17] [122] [124] During this time he spent his time learning and improving further his knowledge of Pali, learning the duties of a Buddhist Monk and writing Buddhist papers for a publication Ceylon [17] Half a year later, on Vesak Day the Full Moon May 1902, a long line of seventy-four Buddhist monks proceed from Kyarook Kyoung towards the wharf edge for the new Samanera's Higher Ordination The ceremony was taken place on the water, presided by Sheve Bya Sayadaw, and it is here that he moved from the ten precepts of a novice to the 227 precepts of a Buddhist Bhikkhu [125] [17] [32] Still unacquainted with the Burmese tongue, Shwe Zedi Saradaw translated each sentence into English, likely the first occurrence of this happening in history [17] His ordination name was Ananda Maitreya, a Sanskrit name, [17] [102] soon to be changed to the Pali rendition Ananda Metteyya to be inline with the Theravada roots, which means \"Bliss of loving kindness\" [105] [126] [3] [127] [102] Ananda was also the name of Gautama Buddha's attendant, and the Sanskrit Maitreya and the Pali Metteyya are the name of the coming Buddha stated in the suttas [128] [129] With fresh vigour he addressed the Sangha at this auspicious ceremony, outlining how he intended to help spread Buddhism to the West [130] He spoke of the conflicts that were forming due to the clash of science and religion, and spoke of a vision of bringing to the West that shining faith and Path of the Buddha that he had first truly experienced in Ceylon Crow quotes him as stating \"Herein, then, lies the work that is before me\", that his purpose is to \"carry to the Lands of the West the Law of Love and Truth\" declared by the Buddha, to establish a Sangha of Bhikkhus in his name [130] [16] [131] Metteyya filled with zeal closes the speech with: \"bringing from the East even unto the West, the splendour of a Dawn beyond our deepest conception; bringing joy from sorrow, and out of Darkness, LIGHT.\" [17]\n\n\nBrotherly bonds of all mankind\n\nIn Rangoon 1903, Metteyya and Ernest Reinhold Rost co-founded the International Buddhist Society known as Buddhasāsana Samāgama It was an \"international Buddhist society that aimed at the global networking of Buddhists.\" [125] [3] [127] [137] [138] Its motto was \"Sabbadānaṁ dhammadānaṁ jināti\" meaning \"The Gift of Truth Excels All Gifts\" taken from the Dhammapada v 354 [139] Metteyya was Secretary General and made Edwin Arnold, the man who was the first to illuminate the Buddhas Path to him with the Light of Asia, the first honorary member of the Society  [140] [141] Harris goes on to state that \"Buddhasāsana Samāgama gained official representatives in Austria, Burma, Ceylon, China, Germany, Italy, America, and England.\" Enthusiasm and greetings began to pour in from all around the world  [137] [142] His friend Cassius Pereira (who later entered the Sangha, becoming Bhikkhu Kassapa in 1947 at the Vajiraramaya Temple) referring to this period recalls that Metteyya gave several \"inspiring addresses from the Maitriya Hall\" Pereira's Father built Maitriya Hall at Lauries Road, Bambalapitiya in honour of Ānanda Metteyya, [143] its related group 'Servants of the Buddha' has been active down to the 21st century  [144]\n\nBuddhist Society of Great Britain and Ireland\nR J Jackson, [167] who with the help of a fellow friend and Buddhist R J Pain [168] founded 'The Buddhist Society of England' [169] [170] With the help of Ernest Reinhold Rost [171] the three of them set up a bookshop at 14 Bury Street, Bloomsbury, close to the British Museum, and would promote the Societies cause by placing Buddhist literature for sale in store front window to encourage interest [122] [172] [173] [174] Rost actively lectured in private congregations and the group soon started to garner support [7] [122] A portable platform was painted in luminous orange bearing the words \"The Word of the Glorious Buddha is sure and everlasting\" and used in parks for lectures also gathering a considerable audience [122] [173] Humphreys referring to Jackson also states \"In 1906 the first English practising Buddhist began to lecture on Buddhism from the traditional soap box in Hyde Park.\" [169]\n\n\nFirst Buddhist mission to England\nWith the recent dawn of \"The Buddhist Society of Great Britain and Ireland\" Ananda Metteyya arrived on the steamship Ava with three devoted lay supporters at Albert Dock on the shores of England, in the United Kingdom, on 22 April 1908 [189] [190] [178] [191] Soon after stepping off the ship, Metteyya was questioned as to his purpose for coming to England, he replied \"in order to set forward the principles of Buddha in this country\" also elucidating that Buddhism blends harmoniously with other creeds, giving one clear example: \"its position as regards Christianity is that it supplements.\" [192]\n\n\nTeachings and declining health\nIn a biographical account Harris reveals that Metteyya had pity and compassion for the hearts of the West He noted the signs of great neglect in our culture such as \"crowded taverns\", overflowing jails and \"sad asylums\" [199] [200] To cope with this loss of religious and moral awareness he had laid down a three-fold agenda as a remedy First to address this loss of moral awareness, so as to encourage the \"spirit of mutual helpfulness\" rather than the current curses faced by society due to such degradation Second, he opposed three misconception about Buddhism: that it was uncivilised worship of idols, that it was \"miracle-mongering and esotericism\" and that it was a spineless, \"apathetic, pessimistic manner of philosophy\" Third he had introduced his impression of Buddhism; as rational, optimistic, and that the Buddha was certainly a remarkable and enlightened Teacher [199]\n\n\nRescuing force of truth\nIn a biographical account Harris reveals that Metteyya had pity and compassion for the hearts of the West He noted the signs of great neglect in our culture such as \"crowded taverns\", overflowing jails and \"sad asylums\" [199] [200] To cope with this loss of religious and moral awareness he had laid down a three-fold agenda as a remedy First to address this loss of moral awareness, so as to encourage the \"spirit of mutual helpfulness\" rather than the current curses faced by society due to such degradation Second, he opposed three misconception about Buddhism: that it was uncivilised worship of idols, that it was \"miracle-mongering and esotericism\" and that it was a spineless, \"apathetic, pessimistic manner of philosophy\" Third he had introduced his impression of Buddhism; as rational, optimistic, and that the Buddha was certainly a remarkable and enlightened Teacher [199]\n\n\nBuddha's message to the West\nOn the 89th anniversary of the 'United Kingdom Buddhist Day' on 16 July 1997, Tilak S Fernando related the life, successes and struggles of Metteyya [210] [211] He states that after returning to Rangoon, Metteyya was highly satisfied with the spiritual success of the mission though his health had steadily declined and the financial support for the mission was exhausted While the Metteyya had found the Teachings were not broadly accepted with great enthusiasm, he was once again determined to push on to further the transmission of this Light [210] In December 1908 Metteyya wrote an \"Open Letter to the Buddhists of England\" earnestly appealing those interested in the Teachings to support the prosperity of the Society At this time the Society had already swollen to one hundred and fifty members, and with all the graceful eloquence and inspiration he could muster, he posed the glory of the Buddha's message as the answer to the immediate needs of the West [210] Fernando goes on to state Metteyya's \"iron will to return to England was still alive, though the effort necessary to carry on with even routine work was terrible.\"  [212]\n\n\nMurmurs and inmost shrine of Buddhism\n\nCrowley set to praise his old guru and published a newspaper article on 13 June 1908, stirring images of the brilliance of his old friend and teacher First painting the surreal graphic details of ceremonial magic then going on to state \"How wonderful must then be the inmost shrine of Buddhism, when we find this same Allan Bennett discarding as childish folly the power of healing the sick, or raising the dead, of the attainment of the Philosopger's Stone, the Red Tincture, the Elixir of Life!\" [83] Metteyya clearly having renounced his prior esoteric path to take up the \"white heights\" of spiritual Buddhist practice [83] \"What strange attraction must lie\" in the yellow robes of a Bhikkhu, \"the Begging Bowl, the shaven head, and the averted eye\" Crowley goes on to rouse Londoners to a monumental illustration that this man has \"torn the heart of Truth bleeding from the dead body of the universe\", that they who are hungry should seek his wisdom That to all serious men who seek for real Faith, that this man has \"passed through all the ways of life and dead\" and he is attained, \"Latin Intra Nobis Regnum: [216] Bhikkhu Ananda Metteyya - Allan Bennett - is the man to help you find it.\" [83] Crowley's arousal of energy, probably purely motivated, was likely a key factor in Metteyya's later character assassination attacks Certainly his former life as an occultist and public admiration from Crowley would have added to the hype of murmurs and baseless accusations [217] [73]\n\nRemembering backwards\nMetteyya in his early teachings and throughout his life prompted those he knew and taught to invoke a meditation practice that would enable the aspirant, firstly to remember backwards and ultimately to recall their past lives [225] [page needed] [2] [226] Being one of the psychic powers used for realisation in Buddhism, he taught it as a tool to see that the continuation of rebirth in saṃsāra is suffering, enabling the aspirant to sharpen ones insight to perfect right view [225] [page needed] [227] [228] [229]\n\n\nDigestible Dhamma and deterioration of health\nMetteyya realised that the best path for Dhamma to arise in the West was through the Sangha of Bhikkhus, that this was the primary and indispensable foundation for the Buddha's Truth taking root in a society [236] This honest realisation was stated in 1910, further in this letter Metteyya announced \"I do not think that the maintenance of a single Bhikkhu, whether myself or another, would, as things now are, at all conduce to that end Quite the contrary, in fact.\"  [236] Here Metteyya was referring to the difficulties of establishing a Sangha of Bhikkhus that could flourish, while strictly adhering to the Vinaya.\n\n\nReturn to England and final years\nArriving in England on 12 September 1914, Bennett met his sister who was to accompany him on the journey to America [252] [178] Unfortunately due to his failing health the US ship medic denied his immigration visa His sister sailed without him, and he found himself stranded, forced to live in poverty and illness in England [252] [51] Bennett, now a layperson, was once again incapacitated with chronic asthma for weeks at a time and with the outbreak of World War I his situation was looking dire [177]\n\n\nThe Wisdom of the Aryas\nWith refreshed vigour, in winter of 1917–1918, Bennett gave a series of six private lectures in Clifford Bax's studio [239] With war raging, Bennett still roused his listeners to the sublime \"Nirvana stands for the Ultimate, the Beyond, and the Goal of Life\", describing that our transient conditioned selfhood was so utterly different to what was truly \"beyond all naming and describing, but far past even Thought itself.\" [254] Also encouraging householders to bring the \"ever-present sun-light of the Teachings\" into their daily lives [255] In May 1918, Bennett aroused the members of the Buddhist Society to fresh enthusiasm in what Christmas Humphreys described as a \"fighting speech\" [256] [178]\n\n\nDeath\nClifford Bax recounts his meeting of Bennett in 1918: \"His face was the most significant that I had ever seen\" that one could both sense the twisting and scoring from years of physical suffering, and a \"lifetime of meditation upon universal love\" these gave rise to the most remarkable impression \"Above all, at the moment of meeting\", Bennett emanated a tender shimmering unwavering \"psychic sunlight\" that was a halo to his persona [264]\n\n\nLegacy\nAllan Bennett was a pioneer, and without him, Buddhism would not have entered the Western world as it did [270] [100] In particular he encouraged and introduced the \"serious study of Buddhism as a spiritual practice\" into Britain, and further fostered its growth in Burma and Ceylon [271] [272] Just before Bennetts death in 1923 the collection of lectures that had taken place in Clifford Bax's studio [273] [239] plus and addition paper on Rebirth were printed in the book The Wisdom of the Aryas [2] [239] Posthumously in 1929 the Theosophical Publishing House in India printed The Religion of Burma and Other Papers a collection of Metteyya's writings from the first decade of the century a rework of the 1911 release [239] [248] This latter collection subsists of the bulk of articles that have been published throughout his life as a Buddhist Monk, and as a devoted Buddhist \"Rightly indeed have the Buddhists of the East decided that these inspiring writings shall not be consigned to the oblivion which overtakes back-numbers of journals, but made accessible to the world in the form of a volume.\" [274] Many of his addresses and papers are still intact, available and in use today

significant role in introducing Buddhism to the Western world. He was born on December 8, 1872, in London, England, to a family of modest means. Bennett's early life was marked by hardship and suffering, with his father passing away when he was still a young boy. His mother struggled to support the family, and Bennett was left to fend for himself from a relatively early age.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nBennett's childhood was difficult, and he suffered from acute asthma, which often left him incapacitated for weeks at a time. Despite these challenges, he showed a keen intellect and a strong desire to learn. He was raised as a strict Roman Catholic, but he eventually left the faith in his teens, seeking a deeper understanding of the spiritual realm. Bennett's interest in spirituality led him to explore various esoteric traditions, including Theosophy and Hermeticism.\n\n**Search for Spiritual Truth**\n\nBennett's search for spiritual truth was a lifelong pursuit. He was drawn to the idea of applying scientific analysis to religion and uncovering true spiritual gnosis. In his late teens, he became fascinated with Sir Edwin Arnold's book \"The Light of Asia,\" which sparked a revolution in his understanding of Buddhism. This book had a profound impact on Bennett, and he eventually announced himself a Buddhist by faith.\n\n**The Golden Dawn**\n\nIn 1894, Bennett was initiated into the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, a mystical organization that emphasized the pursuit of spiritual knowledge and magical powers. Bennett quickly progressed through the grades, becoming a member of the Second Order and adopting the Latin motto \"Voco\" (I Invoke). He was drawn to the mystical and spiritual aspects of the Golden Dawn, rather than its magical and occult practices.\n\n**Poverty, Chronic Sickness, and Accessing Mysteries**\n\nBennett's poverty and chronic sickness often left him struggling to make ends meet. Despite these challenges, he continued to pursue his spiritual interests, eventually becoming a close friend and mentor to Aleister Crowley. Crowley was deeply impressed with Bennett's intellect and spiritual understanding, and the two men formed a lasting bond.\n\n**Travel to Southeast Asia**\n\nIn his late twenties, Bennett traveled to Asia to relieve his chronic asthma and further his studies of Buddhism. He spent four months in Ceylon, where he studied the Pali language and the root Theravadan teachings under an elder Sinhala monk named Venerable Revata Thera. Bennett's time in Ceylon had a profound impact on his spiritual development, and he eventually returned to the West with a newfound understanding of Buddhism.\n\n**Ceylon, Yoga, and Buddhism**\n\nBennett's time in Ceylon was marked by a deep immersion in Buddhist culture and practice. He spent time visiting monasteries, monks, and sacred sites, familiarizing himself with the Buddhist tradition. Bennett's experiences in Ceylon had a significant impact on his spiritual development, and he eventually returned to the West with a newfound understanding of Buddhism.\n\n**Out of Darkness into the Light**\n\nIn 1901, Bennett was accepted into the Order by Lamrna Saradaw as a Samanera (novice monk) in a Buddhist monastery in Akyab. He spent his time learning and improving his knowledge of Pali, learning the duties of a Buddhist monk, and writing Buddhist papers for a publication. Half a year later, Bennett was ordained as a Bhikkhu, adopting the name Ananda Metteyya.\n\n**Brotherly Bonds of All Mankind**\n\nIn 1903, Metteyya co-founded the International Buddhist Society, known as Buddhasāsana Samāgama. The society aimed at global networking of Buddhists, and its motto was \"Sabbadānaṁ dhammadānaṁ jināti\" (The Gift of Truth Excels All Gifts). Metteyya was Secretary General of the society and made Edwin Arnold the first honorary member.\n\n**Buddhist Society of Great Britain and Ireland**\n\nIn 1906, the first English practising Buddhist began to lecture on Buddhism from the traditional soap box in Hyde Park. Metteyya arrived in England in 1908, where he met with R. J. Jackson, who had founded the Buddhist Society of England. Metteyya's teachings and enthusiasm helped to establish the society, and he soon became a prominent figure in the British Buddhist community.\n\n**First Buddhist Mission to England**\n\nIn 1908, Metteyya arrived in England with three devoted lay supporters. He was questioned about his purpose for coming to England, and he replied that he had come to set forward the principles of Buddhism in that country. Metteyya's mission to England was a significant event in the history of Buddhism, and it marked the beginning of a new era in the spread of the teachings.\n\n**Teachings and Declining Health**\n\nMetteyya's teachings emphasized the importance of compassion, loving-kindness, and the cultivation of wisdom. He believed that the best path for Dhamma to arise in the West was through the Sangha of Bhikkhus, and he worked tirelessly to establish a Buddhist community in England. Despite his declining health, Metteyya continued to teach and inspire his followers.\n\n**Murmurs and Inmost Shrine of Buddhism**\n\nCrowley published a newspaper article in 1908, praising Metteyya's spiritual achievements and describing his renunciation of magical practices in favor of Buddhist spirituality. Crowley's article helped to promote Metteyya's teachings and reputation, and it marked the beginning of a new era in the spread of Buddhism in the West.\n\n**Remembering Backwards**\n\nMetteyya taught that the practice of remembering backwards was a tool for realizing the impermanence of all phenomena and the suffering of rebirth in saṃsāra. He encouraged his followers to develop this practice as a means of cultivating wisdom and insight.\n\n**Digestible Dhamma and Deterioration of Health**\n\nMetteyya realized that the best path for Dhamma to arise in the West was through the Sangha of Bhikkhus, and he worked tirelessly to establish a Buddhist community in England. However, his health continued to deteriorate, and he eventually became incapacitated with chronic asthma.\n\n**Return to England and Final Years**\n\nIn 1914, Metteyya returned to England with his sister, who had accompanied him on the journey to America. Unfortunately, Metteyya's health continued to decline, and he was eventually forced to live in poverty and illness in England.\n\n**The Wisdom of the Aryas**\n\nIn 1917-1918, Metteyya gave a series of six private lectures in Clifford Bax's studio, where he emphasized the importance of cultivating wisdom and insight. He described Nirvana as the ultimate goal of life, and encouraged his listeners to bring the teachings into their daily lives.\n\n**Death**\n\nClifford Bax recounts his meeting with Metteyya in 1918, describing his face as the most significant he had ever seen. Metteyya's face showed the signs of years of physical suffering, but it also radiated a sense of universal love and compassion.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nAllan Bennett was a pioneer in the spread of Buddhism in the West, and his legacy continues to inspire and guide Buddhist practitioners today. His teachings emphasized the importance of compassion, loving-kindness, and the cultivation of wisdom, and his legacy serves as a reminder of the power of the Buddhist teachings to transform and uplift humanity.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Charles_Henry_Allan_Bennett\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nAllan Bennett was born in London on 8 December 1872,  [7] [8] his full name at birth was Charles Henry Allan Bennett His only sister, Charlotte Louise was born in Brighton about a year before [9] His childhood was difficult and filled with suffering His father died when he was still a boy, and his mother struggled to support the family, who nevertheless raised him as a strict Roman Catholic  [10] [11] [12] [13] During his youth he was plagued with bouts of acute asthma, which were debilitating even for weeks at a time [9] [14]\n\n\nSearch for spiritual truth\nHaving left Catholicism in his teens, Bennett was still in search to fill the void that had formed from this parting as he ever wished to find his place in the spiritual spectrum [14] Having a heart and intellect that sought cause and effect, analytical knowledge and wisdom, he wanted to apply scientific analysis to religion and uncover true spiritual gnosis When Bennett was eighteen he fell in love with Sir Edwin Arnolds' book The Light of Asia (1879), which at the time was said to cause \"an enormous upsurge in awareness of, and interest in, Buddhism\" [16] [28] [3] This was a real turning point in Bennett's life, and made a revolutionary impression that lasted his lifetime [29] [30] [31] [14] He was so deeply moved by the pure and rational faith experienced through Arnold's poetry This religious experience lead the way for Bennett to develop a closer association with the existing English translations of Buddhist Scriptures [31] [16] Thus at this tender age of eighteen, having been inspired by The Light of Asia, Bennett announced himself a Buddhist by Faith  [32] [16] [8]\n\n\nGolden Dawn\nBennett was initiated into the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in 1894, [39] taking the Latin motto \"Voco\", (\"I Invoke\") [40] He quickly progressed through the grades, entering the Second Order as a 5=6 on 22 March 1895 and taking the Hebrew motto \"Iehi Aour\", (\"let there be light\") [40] [41] [42] [5] He was always very poor and tormented by illness, but still made a strong impression on other occultists of the time [43] Bennett was one of the most luminous minds in the order [44] [45] [31] [14] and favoured mysticism and white magic rather than the occult  [3] [46] Bennett was almost wholly concerned with divine knowledge and enlightenment rather than siddhis (magical powers) seeing them as mundane and divorced from the unrealised but glimpsed heights of spiritual attainment [36] [46] [25]\n\n\nDawn of the esoteric\nBennett was initiated into the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in 1894, [39] taking the Latin motto \"Voco\", (\"I Invoke\") [40] He quickly progressed through the grades, entering the Second Order as a 5=6 on 22 March 1895 and taking the Hebrew motto \"Iehi Aour\", (\"let there be light\") [40] [41] [42] [5] He was always very poor and tormented by illness, but still made a strong impression on other occultists of the time [43] Bennett was one of the most luminous minds in the order [44] [45] [31] [14] and favoured mysticism and white magic rather than the occult  [3] [46] Bennett was almost wholly concerned with divine knowledge and enlightenment rather than siddhis (magical powers) seeing them as mundane and divorced from the unrealised but glimpsed heights of spiritual attainment [36] [46] [25]\n\n\nPoverty, chronic sickness, and accessing mysteries\nSoon after the meeting, Crowley was shocked to find that Bennett was living in a dilapidated apartment in the slums south of the Thames with another Brother of the Order Crowley, deeply impressed with the man also pitying his situation, invited Bennett to come stay with him, now enabling the two light seekers to work together more fluently [57] Crowley organised a room for him in his Chancery Lane flat, \"and settled down to pick his brains\", for he knew his reputation \"as the one magician who could really do big-time stuff\" [25] For days, weeks and months, Bennett trained Crowley in the basics of magic [69] and tried to instill a devotion to white magic [70] Bennett was generally ascetic and reputedly sexually chaste, a marked contrast to Crowley's libertine attitude [71] In a fictional work Crowley depicts Bennett's disposition towards chastity stating \"He had an aversion to all such matters amounting to horror.\" [23] Even though all early sources point to Bennett's chastity, unfounded rumours seem to of circulated in later years in an attempt to smear Crowley Israel Regardie, who was a personal secretary of Crowley's for a time, agrees the rumours seem to be baseless, that he never heard anything from Crowley or any substantiated claim to suggest otherwise [72] [60] [73] Crowley had said of him \"We called him the White Knight\", that there \"never walked a whiter man on earth\" that he was a harmless, lovable \"terribly frustrated genius\" [25]\n\n\nImpact, influence, and change of view\nIn a hallowing scene Bennett is described as \"calm, majestic, clearly master of it all\", Crowley paints in detail the aura of the man, that thunders forth; \"instantly a ray of divine brilliance cleaves the black clouds above his head, and his noble countenance flashing in that ecstasy of brightness.\" [83] Crowley stating how this picture of Bennett was the literal truth That Bennett was one of the very few people that he had met \"who really could get .. the results they wished for\" in this esoteric field, for it is easy for most to get unwished for results \"madness, death, marriage\" [83]\n\n\nTravel to Southeast Asia\nAt some time between 1889 and 1900, in his late twenties, Bennett traveled to Asia [100] [101] [102] to relieve his chronic asthma, after submersing himself in the study Buddhism [16] [32] He traveled to Ceylon as a self-converted Buddhist, staying at Kamburugamuwa in the Matara district for four months, Bennett studied the Pali language and the root Theravadan Teachings under an elder Sinhala monk Venerable Revata Thera [17] [3] Cassius Pereira later recalled that \"such was the brilliance of his intellect\" that he had mastered that ancient tongue in six months and could fluently converse.\" [103] [104] Further that Bennett \"made many close friends amongst the Buddhists of Ceylon, who gave him much assistance in every way.\" [104] Bennett also spent time visiting monasteries, monks and sacred sites, familiarising and immersing himself with the Buddhist culture and practice of Ceylon  [31]\n\n\nCeylon, yoga and Buddhism\nAt some time between 1889 and 1900, in his late twenties, Bennett traveled to Asia [100] [101] [102] to relieve his chronic asthma, after submersing himself in the study Buddhism [16] [32] He traveled to Ceylon as a self-converted Buddhist, staying at Kamburugamuwa in the Matara district for four months, Bennett studied the Pali language and the root Theravadan Teachings under an elder Sinhala monk Venerable Revata Thera [17] [3] Cassius Pereira later recalled that \"such was the brilliance of his intellect\" that he had mastered that ancient tongue in six months and could fluently converse.\" [103] [104] Further that Bennett \"made many close friends amongst the Buddhists of Ceylon, who gave him much assistance in every way.\" [104] Bennett also spent time visiting monasteries, monks and sacred sites, familiarising and immersing himself with the Buddhist culture and practice of Ceylon  [31]\n\n\nOut of darkness into the light\nBennett travelled to the coastal city of Akyab at took up residence at the Buddhist monastery, the Lamma Sayadaw Kyoung Bennett was accepted into the Order by Lamrna Saradaw as a Samanera (novice monk) on 8 December 1901  [123] [17] [122] [124] During this time he spent his time learning and improving further his knowledge of Pali, learning the duties of a Buddhist Monk and writing Buddhist papers for a publication Ceylon [17] Half a year later, on Vesak Day the Full Moon May 1902, a long line of seventy-four Buddhist monks proceed from Kyarook Kyoung towards the wharf edge for the new Samanera's Higher Ordination The ceremony was taken place on the water, presided by Sheve Bya Sayadaw, and it is here that he moved from the ten precepts of a novice to the 227 precepts of a Buddhist Bhikkhu [125] [17] [32] Still unacquainted with the Burmese tongue, Shwe Zedi Saradaw translated each sentence into English, likely the first occurrence of this happening in history [17] His ordination name was Ananda Maitreya, a Sanskrit name, [17] [102] soon to be changed to the Pali rendition Ananda Metteyya to be inline with the Theravada roots, which means \"Bliss of loving kindness\" [105] [126] [3] [127] [102] Ananda was also the name of Gautama Buddha's attendant, and the Sanskrit Maitreya and the Pali Metteyya are the name of the coming Buddha stated in the suttas [128] [129] With fresh vigour he addressed the Sangha at this auspicious ceremony, outlining how he intended to help spread Buddhism to the West [130] He spoke of the conflicts that were forming due to the clash of science and religion, and spoke of a vision of bringing to the West that shining faith and Path of the Buddha that he had first truly experienced in Ceylon Crow quotes him as stating \"Herein, then, lies the work that is before me\", that his purpose is to \"carry to the Lands of the West the Law of Love and Truth\" declared by the Buddha, to establish a Sangha of Bhikkhus in his name [130] [16] [131] Metteyya filled with zeal closes the speech with: \"bringing from the East even unto the West, the splendour of a Dawn beyond our deepest conception; bringing joy from sorrow, and out of Darkness, LIGHT.\" [17]\n\n\nBrotherly bonds of all mankind\n\nIn Rangoon 1903, Metteyya and Ernest Reinhold Rost co-founded the International Buddhist Society known as Buddhasāsana Samāgama It was an \"international Buddhist society that aimed at the global networking of Buddhists.\" [125] [3] [127] [137] [138] Its motto was \"Sabbadānaṁ dhammadānaṁ jināti\" meaning \"The Gift of Truth Excels All Gifts\" taken from the Dhammapada v 354 [139] Metteyya was Secretary General and made Edwin Arnold, the man who was the first to illuminate the Buddhas Path to him with the Light of Asia, the first honorary member of the Society  [140] [141] Harris goes on to state that \"Buddhasāsana Samāgama gained official representatives in Austria, Burma, Ceylon, China, Germany, Italy, America, and England.\" Enthusiasm and greetings began to pour in from all around the world  [137] [142] His friend Cassius Pereira (who later entered the Sangha, becoming Bhikkhu Kassapa in 1947 at the Vajiraramaya Temple) referring to this period recalls that Metteyya gave several \"inspiring addresses from the Maitriya Hall\" Pereira's Father built Maitriya Hall at Lauries Road, Bambalapitiya in honour of Ānanda Metteyya, [143] its related group 'Servants of the Buddha' has been active down to the 21st century  [144]\n\nBuddhist Society of Great Britain and Ireland\nR J Jackson, [167] who with the help of a fellow friend and Buddhist R J Pain [168] founded 'The Buddhist Society of England' [169] [170] With the help of Ernest Reinhold Rost [171] the three of them set up a bookshop at 14 Bury Street, Bloomsbury, close to the British Museum, and would promote the Societies cause by placing Buddhist literature for sale in store front window to encourage interest [122] [172] [173] [174] Rost actively lectured in private congregations and the group soon started to garner support [7] [122] A portable platform was painted in luminous orange bearing the words \"The Word of the Glorious Buddha is sure and everlasting\" and used in parks for lectures also gathering a considerable audience [122] [173] Humphreys referring to Jackson also states \"In 1906 the first English practising Buddhist began to lecture on Buddhism from the traditional soap box in Hyde Park.\" [169]\n\n\nFirst Buddhist mission to England\nWith the recent dawn of \"The Buddhist Society of Great Britain and Ireland\" Ananda Metteyya arrived on the steamship Ava with three devoted lay supporters at Albert Dock on the shores of England, in the United Kingdom, on 22 April 1908 [189] [190] [178] [191] Soon after stepping off the ship, Metteyya was questioned as to his purpose for coming to England, he replied \"in order to set forward the principles of Buddha in this country\" also elucidating that Buddhism blends harmoniously with other creeds, giving one clear example: \"its position as regards Christianity is that it supplements.\" [192]\n\n\nTeachings and declining health\nIn a biographical account Harris reveals that Metteyya had pity and compassion for the hearts of the West He noted the signs of great neglect in our culture such as \"crowded taverns\", overflowing jails and \"sad asylums\" [199] [200] To cope with this loss of religious and moral awareness he had laid down a three-fold agenda as a remedy First to address this loss of moral awareness, so as to encourage the \"spirit of mutual helpfulness\" rather than the current curses faced by society due to such degradation Second, he opposed three misconception about Buddhism: that it was uncivilised worship of idols, that it was \"miracle-mongering and esotericism\" and that it was a spineless, \"apathetic, pessimistic manner of philosophy\" Third he had introduced his impression of Buddhism; as rational, optimistic, and that the Buddha was certainly a remarkable and enlightened Teacher [199]\n\n\nRescuing force of truth\nIn a biographical account Harris reveals that Metteyya had pity and compassion for the hearts of the West He noted the signs of great neglect in our culture such as \"crowded taverns\", overflowing jails and \"sad asylums\" [199] [200] To cope with this loss of religious and moral awareness he had laid down a three-fold agenda as a remedy First to address this loss of moral awareness, so as to encourage the \"spirit of mutual helpfulness\" rather than the current curses faced by society due to such degradation Second, he opposed three misconception about Buddhism: that it was uncivilised worship of idols, that it was \"miracle-mongering and esotericism\" and that it was a spineless, \"apathetic, pessimistic manner of philosophy\" Third he had introduced his impression of Buddhism; as rational, optimistic, and that the Buddha was certainly a remarkable and enlightened Teacher [199]\n\n\nBuddha's message to the West\nOn the 89th anniversary of the 'United Kingdom Buddhist Day' on 16 July 1997, Tilak S Fernando related the life, successes and struggles of Metteyya [210] [211] He states that after returning to Rangoon, Metteyya was highly satisfied with the spiritual success of the mission though his health had steadily declined and the financial support for the mission was exhausted While the Metteyya had found the Teachings were not broadly accepted with great enthusiasm, he was once again determined to push on to further the transmission of this Light [210] In December 1908 Metteyya wrote an \"Open Letter to the Buddhists of England\" earnestly appealing those interested in the Teachings to support the prosperity of the Society At this time the Society had already swollen to one hundred and fifty members, and with all the graceful eloquence and inspiration he could muster, he posed the glory of the Buddha's message as the answer to the immediate needs of the West [210] Fernando goes on to state Metteyya's \"iron will to return to England was still alive, though the effort necessary to carry on with even routine work was terrible.\"  [212]\n\n\nMurmurs and inmost shrine of Buddhism\n\nCrowley set to praise his old guru and published a newspaper article on 13 June 1908, stirring images of the brilliance of his old friend and teacher First painting the surreal graphic details of ceremonial magic then going on to state \"How wonderful must then be the inmost shrine of Buddhism, when we find this same Allan Bennett discarding as childish folly the power of healing the sick, or raising the dead, of the attainment of the Philosopger's Stone, the Red Tincture, the Elixir of Life!\" [83] Metteyya clearly having renounced his prior esoteric path to take up the \"white heights\" of spiritual Buddhist practice [83] \"What strange attraction must lie\" in the yellow robes of a Bhikkhu, \"the Begging Bowl, the shaven head, and the averted eye\" Crowley goes on to rouse Londoners to a monumental illustration that this man has \"torn the heart of Truth bleeding from the dead body of the universe\", that they who are hungry should seek his wisdom That to all serious men who seek for real Faith, that this man has \"passed through all the ways of life and dead\" and he is attained, \"Latin Intra Nobis Regnum: [216] Bhikkhu Ananda Metteyya - Allan Bennett - is the man to help you find it.\" [83] Crowley's arousal of energy, probably purely motivated, was likely a key factor in Metteyya's later character assassination attacks Certainly his former life as an occultist and public admiration from Crowley would have added to the hype of murmurs and baseless accusations [217] [73]\n\nRemembering backwards\nMetteyya in his early teachings and throughout his life prompted those he knew and taught to invoke a meditation practice that would enable the aspirant, firstly to remember backwards and ultimately to recall their past lives [225] [page needed] [2] [226] Being one of the psychic powers used for realisation in Buddhism, he taught it as a tool to see that the continuation of rebirth in saṃsāra is suffering, enabling the aspirant to sharpen ones insight to perfect right view [225] [page needed] [227] [228] [229]\n\n\nDigestible Dhamma and deterioration of health\nMetteyya realised that the best path for Dhamma to arise in the West was through the Sangha of Bhikkhus, that this was the primary and indispensable foundation for the Buddha's Truth taking root in a society [236] This honest realisation was stated in 1910, further in this letter Metteyya announced \"I do not think that the maintenance of a single Bhikkhu, whether myself or another, would, as things now are, at all conduce to that end Quite the contrary, in fact.\"  [236] Here Metteyya was referring to the difficulties of establishing a Sangha of Bhikkhus that could flourish, while strictly adhering to the Vinaya.\n\n\nReturn to England and final years\nArriving in England on 12 September 1914, Bennett met his sister who was to accompany him on the journey to America [252] [178] Unfortunately due to his failing health the US ship medic denied his immigration visa His sister sailed without him, and he found himself stranded, forced to live in poverty and illness in England [252] [51] Bennett, now a layperson, was once again incapacitated with chronic asthma for weeks at a time and with the outbreak of World War I his situation was looking dire [177]\n\n\nThe Wisdom of the Aryas\nWith refreshed vigour, in winter of 1917–1918, Bennett gave a series of six private lectures in Clifford Bax's studio [239] With war raging, Bennett still roused his listeners to the sublime \"Nirvana stands for the Ultimate, the Beyond, and the Goal of Life\", describing that our transient conditioned selfhood was so utterly different to what was truly \"beyond all naming and describing, but far past even Thought itself.\" [254] Also encouraging householders to bring the \"ever-present sun-light of the Teachings\" into their daily lives [255] In May 1918, Bennett aroused the members of the Buddhist Society to fresh enthusiasm in what Christmas Humphreys described as a \"fighting speech\" [256] [178]\n\n\nDeath\nClifford Bax recounts his meeting of Bennett in 1918: \"His face was the most significant that I had ever seen\" that one could both sense the twisting and scoring from years of physical suffering, and a \"lifetime of meditation upon universal love\" these gave rise to the most remarkable impression \"Above all, at the moment of meeting\", Bennett emanated a tender shimmering unwavering \"psychic sunlight\" that was a halo to his persona [264]\n\n\nLegacy\nAllan Bennett was a pioneer, and without him, Buddhism would not have entered the Western world as it did [270] [100] In particular he encouraged and introduced the \"serious study of Buddhism as a spiritual practice\" into Britain, and further fostered its growth in Burma and Ceylon [271] [272] Just before Bennetts death in 1923 the collection of lectures that had taken place in Clifford Bax's studio [273] [239] plus and addition paper on Rebirth were printed in the book The Wisdom of the Aryas [2] [239] Posthumously in 1929 the Theosophical Publishing House in India printed The Religion of Burma and Other Papers a collection of Metteyya's writings from the first decade of the century a rework of the 1911 release [239] [248] This latter collection subsists of the bulk of articles that have been published throughout his life as a Buddhist Monk, and as a devoted Buddhist \"Rightly indeed have the Buddhists of the East decided that these inspiring writings shall not be consigned to the oblivion which overtakes back-numbers of journals, but made accessible to the world in the form of a volume.\" [274] Many of his addresses and papers are still intact, available and in use today [275]\n\n\nWorks\n\"Ariya-puggala\" Britannica Encyclopædia Britannica 2021 Retrieved 18 April 2021.\n\n\nSee also\n\"Ariya-puggala\" Britannica Encyclopædia Britannica 2021

showcases and opening for local talent, they caught the attention of record executive Derek Shulman, who signed them to Mercury Records and who was part of the PolyGram company Because Jon Bon Jovi wanted a group name, Pamela Maher, a friend of Richard Fischer and an employee of Doc McGhee, suggested they call themselves Bon Jovi, following the example of the other famous two-word bands such as Van Halen This name was chosen instead of the original idea of Johnny Electric Pamela's suggestion of the name was met with little enthusiasm, but two years later they hit the charts under that name

in New Jersey, USA in 1983. The band consists of Jon Bon Jovi (lead vocals, guitar), David Bryan (keyboards, backing vocals), Tico Torres (drums), Hugh McDonald (bass), and Phil X (guitar). The band has undergone several lineup changes over the years, but the core membership has remained the same.\n\n**History**\n\nJon Bon Jovi began performing music live in 1975, at the age of 13, playing piano and guitar with his first band, Raze. At 16, Jon met David Bryan and formed a band called Atlantic City Expressway. Still in his teens, Bon Jovi played in the band John Bongiovi and the Wild Ones at clubs such as the Fast Lane and opening for local acts. By 1980, he had formed another band, the Rest, and opened up for New Jersey acts such as Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes.\n\nAlso in 1980, Jon recorded his first single, \"Runaway\" in his cousin's studio, backed up by studio musicians. The song was played by a local radio station on a compilation tape.\n\n**Formation and \"Runaway\" (1980–1983)**\n\nJon Bon Jovi began performing music live in 1975, at the age of 13, playing piano and guitar with his first band, Raze.

Because Jon Bon Jovi wanted a group name, Pamela Maher, a friend of Richard Fischer and an employee of Doc McGhee, suggested they call themselves Bon Jovi, following the example of the other famous two-word bands such as Van Halen. This name was chosen instead of the original idea of Johnny Electric. Pamela's suggestion of the name was met with little enthusiasm, but two years later they hit the charts under that name.\n\n**Keep the Faith, Cross Road and These Days (1992–1996)**\n\nDisillusioned with the music business and unhappy with the status quo, Jon Bon Jovi fired his management, business advisers, and agents (including long-time manager Doc McGhee) in 1991.

It was dominated by those clubs who had supported professionalism. The twelve founding members were six from Lancashire (Accrington, Blackburn Rovers, Burnley, Bolton Wanderers, Everton, and Preston North End) and six from the Midlands (Aston Villa, Derby County, Notts County, Stoke, West Bromwich Albion, and Wolverhampton Wanderers).

The system is divided into several levels, with the top division, the Premier League, being the most prestigious and competitive. The system is designed to provide a platform for clubs to compete with each other, both on and off the pitch, and to provide a pathway for clubs to rise through the divisions and achieve success.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* English football\n* Premier League\n* English Football League\n* FA Cup\n* UEFA Champions League\n* UEFA Europa League\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe English football league system is a pyramid-shaped structure of leagues, bound together by the principle of promotion and relegation.

It is highly probable that the present manuscript represents the most complete witness to the revised version of the Encomium\" The manuscript was put up for auction in December 2008, and purchased for £600,000 (5.2 million Danish kroner) on behalf of the Royal Library, Denmark [22] Unlike the Liber Vitae, the compendium does not contain any images of Emma.\nThe New Minster Liber Vitae, now in the British Library, was completed in 1030, shortly before Cnut's death in 1035 The frontispiece depicts \"King Cnut and Queen Emma presenting a cross to the altar of New Minster, Winchester.\" Stafford in her visual exegesis of the portrait states, \"it is not clear whether we should read it as a representation of a powerful woman or a powerless one.\" [18] In one portrait, each facet of Emma's role as sovereign is displayed; that of a dutiful wife and influential queen.\n\n\nThe Ordeal of Queen Emma\n The Ordeal of Queen Emma by Fire at Winchester is a legend that seems to have originated in the 13th century Queen Emma was accused of unchastity with Bishop Ælfwine of Winchester In order to prove her innocence, she was obliged to undergo the ordeal of walking over nine red-hot ploughshares placed on the pavement of the nave of Winchester Cathedral Two bishops conducted the barefoot queen to the line of red-hot ploughshares She walked over the red-hot ploughshares, but, having sought the protection of St Swithun, whose shrine is at Winchester, felt neither the naked iron nor the fire [24] [25] William Blake did an illustration of the event.\n\n\nFamily tree\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Emma of Normandy\n\nEmma of Normandy (c. 985 – 6 March 1052) was a queen of England and Denmark, as well as a member of the powerful House of Normandy. She played a significant role in the politics of England during the 11th century, serving as queen consort to two kings: Æthelred II of England and Cnut the Great.\n\n## Introduction\n\nEmma of Normandy was a key figure in the history of England during the 11th century. Born around 985, she was the daughter of Richard I, Duke of Normandy, and his wife, Gunnor. Her family's connections to the English throne were significant, and Emma's two marriages to English kings cemented her position as a powerful queen. Through her marriages and her children, Emma influenced the succession of the English throne and played a crucial role in shaping the course of English history.\n\n## Marriage to Æthelred II\n\nIn an attempt to pacify Normandy, King Æthelred of England married Emma in 1002. This marriage was intended to unite against the Viking threat, as Viking raids on England were often based in Normandy during the late 10th century. Upon their marriage, Emma was given the Anglo-Saxon name of Ælfgifu, which was used for formal and official matters. As queen, Emma received properties of her own in Winchester, Rutland, Devonshire, Suffolk, and Oxfordshire, as well as the city of Exeter.\n\n## Marriage to Cnut\n\nCnut gained control of most of England after he defeated Edmund Ironside on 18 October 1016, at the Battle of Assandun. After their marriage in 1017, Emma's sons from her marriage to Æthelred were sent to live in Normandy under the tutelage of her brother. At this time, Emma became Queen of England, and later of Denmark and Norway.\n\n## Children\n\nDuring her two marriages, Emma had five children:\n\n1. Edward the Confessor (c. 1003 – 1066)\n2. Ælfred (c. 1005 – 1036)\n3. Godgifu (c. 1007 – 1047)\n4. Hardicanute (c. 1010 – 1042)\n5. Alfred Aetheling (c. 1012 – 1036)\n\n## Conspiracy regarding the death of Alfred\n\nIn 1036, Alfred Aetheling and Edward the Confessor, Emma's sons by Æthelred, returned to England from their exile in Normandy to visit their mother. During their time in England, they were supposed to be protected by Harthacnut. However, Harthacnut was involved with his kingdom in Denmark, and Alfred was captured and blinded by holding a hot iron poker to his eyes. He later died from his wounds.\n\n## Harthacnut's reign\n\nHarthacnut, Emma and Cnut's son, assembled a fleet to invade England in 1039, and when Harold died in March 1040, he was invited to become king. Harthacnut crossed to England with his fleet and Emma. He was criticized by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for his heavy taxation to pay for the fleet and for having Harold's body disinterred and thrown into a ditch. In 1041, he invited his half-brother Edward the Confessor to England, and Edward was sworn in as king. This may have been persuaded by Emma, who would have been keen to preserve her position by ensuring that England was still ruled by a son of hers.\n\n## Edward's reign\n\nAfter Harthacnut's death in June 1042, Edward the Confessor succeeded to the throne and was crowned in April 1043. During the same year, Edward rode to Winchester along with Earls Leofric, Godwin, and Siward, accused Emma of treason, and deprived her of her lands and titles. However, Edward soon relented, and Emma's lands and titles were restored.\n\n## Death and burial\n\nAfter her death in 1052, Emma was interred alongside Cnut and Harthacnut in the Old Minster, Winchester. She was later transferred to the new cathedral built after the Norman Conquest. During the English Civil War (1642–1651), their remains were disinterred and scattered about the Cathedral floor by parliamentary forces. The jumbled bones were later re-interred.\n\n## Queenship\n\nAs Pauline Stafford noted, Emma is the \"first of the early medieval queens\" to be depicted through contemporary portraiture. Emma is the central figure within the Encomium Emmae Reginae, a critical source for the study of English succession in the 11th century. During the reign of Æthelred, Emma most likely served as little more than a figurehead, a physical embodiment of the treaty between the English and her Norman father. However, her influence increased considerably under Cnut.\n\n## The Encomium Emmæ Reginae or Gesta Cnutonis Regis\n\nThe Encomium is divided into three parts, the first of which deals with Sweyn Forkbeard and his conquest of England. The second focuses on Cnut and relates the defeat of \"Princes\" Æthelred (never named) and Edmund, Cnut's marriage to Emma (again, without mentioning she had been the wife of Æthelred), and Cnut's kingship. The third address the events after Cnut's death; Emma's involvement in the seizing of the royal treasury, and the treachery of Earl Godwin.\n\n## Scholarly debate\n\nThe flattery in the Encomium, which describes Emma as \"the most distinguished woman of her time for delightful beauty and wisdom,\" has been interpreted by scholars as a deliberate attempt to intervene on Emma's behalf in the politics of the Anglo-Danish court.\n\n## Manuscripts\n\nPrior to May 2008, only one copy of the Encomium was believed to exist. However, a late-14th-century manuscript, the Courtenay Compendium, was discovered in the Devon Record Office, where it had languished since the 1960s. The manuscript was put up for auction in December 2008 and purchased for £600,000 on behalf of the Royal Library, Denmark.\n\n## The New Minster Liber Vitae\n\nThe New Minster Liber Vitae, now in the British Library, was completed in 1030, shortly before Cnut's death in 1035.

Emma's involvement in the seizing of the royal treasury, and the treachery of Earl Godwin It begins by addressing Emma, \"May our Lord Jesus Christ preserve you, O Queen, who excel all those of your sex in the amiability of your way of life.\" [19] Emma is \"the most distinguished woman of her time for delightful beauty and wisdom.\" [20]\n\n\nScholarly debate\nThis flattery, writes Elizabeth M Tyler, is \"part of a deliberate attempt to intervene, on Emma's behalf, in the politics of the Anglo-Danish court,\" [21] a connotation which an 11th-century audience would have understood This proves to be a direct contrast to earlier evaluations of the text, such as the introduction to the 1998 reprint of Alistair Campbell's 1949 edition in which Simon Keynes remarks: \n\n\nManuscripts\nPrior to May 2008 only one copy of the Encomium was believed to exist However, a late-14th-century manuscript, the Courtenay Compendium, was discovered in the Devon Record Office, where it had languished since the 1960s According to a report by the UK Arts Council, \"The most significant item  [within the text] for British history is the Encomium Emma Reginae .. It is highly probable that the present manuscript represents the most complete witness to the revised version of the Encomium\" The manuscript was put up for auction in December 2008, and purchased for £600,000 (5.2 million Danish kroner) on behalf of the Royal Library, Denmark [22] Unlike the Liber Vitae, the compendium does not contain any images of Emma.\nThe New Minster Liber Vitae, now in the British Library, was completed in 1030, shortly before Cnut's death in 1035 The frontispiece depicts \"King Cnut and Queen Emma presenting a cross to the altar of New Minster, Winchester.\" Stafford in her visual exegesis of the portrait states, \"it is not clear whether we should read it as a representation of a powerful woman or a powerless one.\" [18] In one portrait, each facet of Emma's role as sovereign is displayed; that of a dutiful wife and influential queen.\n\n\nThe Ordeal of Queen Emma\n The Ordeal of Queen Emma by Fire at Winchester is a legend that seems to have originated in the 13th century Queen Emma was accused of unchastity with Bishop Ælfwine of Winchester In order to prove her innocence, she was obliged to undergo the ordeal of walking over nine red-hot ploughshares placed on the pavement of the nave of Winchester Cathedral Two bishops conducted the barefoot queen to the line of red-hot ploughshares She walked over the red-hot ploughshares, but, having sought the protection of St Swithun, whose shrine is at Winchester, felt neither the naked iron nor the fire [24] [25] William Blake did an illustration of the event.\n\n\nFamily tree\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

of mind or psychic being; Supermind), akin to the five koshas or sheaths, and three types of being (outer being, inner being, psychic being) The psychic being refers to the higher reaches of mind

an integral divine transformation of the entire being, rather than the liberation of only a single faculty such as the intellect or the emotions or the body [15] [third-party source needed]\n\n\nStructural stage theory\nStructural stage theories are based on the observation that humans develop through a pattern of distinct stages over time, and that these stages can be described based on their distinguishing characteristics In Piaget's theory of cognitive development, and related models like those of James Mark Baldwin, Jane Loevinger, Robert Kegan, Lawrence Kohlberg, and James W Fowler, stages have a constant order of succession, later stages integrate the achievements of earlier stages, and each is characterized by a particular type of structure of mental processes which is specific to it The time of appearance may vary to a certain extent depending upon environmental conditions [16]\n\n\nJean Gebser - mutations of consciousness\nThe word integral was independently suggested by Jean Gebser (1905–1973), a Swiss phenomenologist and interdisciplinary scholar, in 1939 to describe his own intuition regarding the structure of human consciousness that would follow the modern or mental structure Gebser was the author of The Ever-Present Origin, which describes human history as a series of mutations in consciousness He only afterwards discovered the similarity between his own ideas and those of Sri Aurobindo and Teilhard de Chardin [17]\n\n\nSpiral Dynamics and collaboration with Don Beck\nAfter completing Sex, Ecology, Spirituality (1995), Ken Wilber started to collaborate with Don Beck, whose Spiral Dynamics is based on the work of Clare W Graves, and which shows strong correlations with Wilber's model [20] Beck and Christopher Cowan had published their application and extension of Graves's work in 1996 in Spiral Dynamics: Mastering Values, Leadership, and Change [21] Wilber also referenced Graves's emergent cyclical levels of existence in Sex, Ecology, Spirituality, when he introduced his quadrant model, [note 2] and began to incorporate Spiral Dynamics in the \"Integral Psychology\" section of The Collected Works of Ken Wilber (Vol 4) in 1999, [22] and gave it a prominent place in the 2000 edition of A Theory of Everything [23]\n\n\nWilber's metatheory\nIn Sex, Ecology, Spirituality (1995), Wilber introduced his AQAL (All Quadrants All Levels All Lines All States All Types) metatheory, a framework which consists of five fundamental concepts, sometimes called the five elements This includes the four quadrant model, levels of development, lines of development, states of consciousness, as well as the notion of types In this schema the four quadrant model is foundational, and the remaining four elements are then added to flesh out topics more fully [30] According to Wilber, the AQAL model is one of the most comprehensive approaches to reality, a metatheory in which all academic disciplines and every form of knowledge and experience fit together coherently [13]\n\n\nFour quadrants\n\"I\"\nInterior Individual\nIntentional\n\n\nLevels or stages\nThe basis of Wilber's theory is his developmental model Wilber's model follows the discrete structural stages of development, as described in the structural stage theories of developmental psychology, including but-not-limited to Loevinger's stages of ego development, [40] Piaget's theory of cognitive development, [41] [42] Kohlberg's stages of moral development, [43] Erikson's stages of psychosocial development, [41] and Fowler's stages of spiritual development [citation needed]\n\n\nLines, streams, or intelligences\nAccording to Wilber, various domains or lines of development, or intelligences can be discerned [44] They include cognitive, ethical, aesthetic, spiritual, kinesthetic, affective, musical, spatial, and logical-mathematical For example, one can be highly developed cognitively (cerebrally smart) without being highly developed morally (as in the case of Nazi doctors) [citation needed]\n\n\nStates\nStates are temporary states of consciousness, such as waking, dreaming and sleeping, bodily sensations, and drug-induced and meditation-induced states Some states are interpreted as temporary intimations of higher stages of development [45] [46] Wilber's formulation is: \"States are free, structures are earned\" [47] A person has to build or earn structure; it cannot be peak-experienced for free What can be peak-experienced, however, are higher states of freedom from the stage a person is habituated to, so these deeper or higher states can be experienced at any level [note 7]\n\n\nTypes\nTypes are models and theories that do not fit into Wilber's other categorizations Wilber makes types part of his model in order to point out that these distinctions are different from the already mentioned distinctions: quadrants, lines, levels and states [48] They are styles, emphases, or interpretations that influence a person's or a culture's perspectives, but that are non-hierarchical and non-normative No type is in-and-of-itself better than another Examples includes masculine/feminine typologies, the nine Enneagram categories, and Jung's psychological typologies All types are considered potentially valid, though Wilber also argued the evidence for types is somewhat less persuasive than the four other elements of AQAL theory [2]\n\n\nHolons\nHolons are the individual building blocks of Wilber's model Wilber borrowed the concept of holons from Arthur Koestler's description of the great chain of being, a mediaeval description of levels of being \"Holon\" means that every entity and concept is both an entity on its own, and a hierarchical part of a larger whole For example, a cell in an organism is both a whole as a cell, and at the same time a part of another whole, the organism Likewise a letter is a self-existing entity and simultaneously an integral part of a word, which then is part of a sentence, which is part of a paragraph, which is part of a page; and so on Everything from quarks to matter to energy to ideas can be looked at in this way The relation between individuals and society is not the same as between cells and organisms though, because individual holons can be members but not parts of social holons [note 6]\n\n\nReception\nAccording to Frank Visser, Wilber's early work was praised by transpersonal psychologists, but support for Wilber \"even in transpersonal circles\" had waned by the early 1990s [51] In 2002 Wilber stated that he had long since stopped identifying himself with the transpersonal field, citing what he found to be deep and irreconcilable confusions in the field [52]\n\n\nReception in mainstream academia\nAccording to Frank Visser,

stopped identifying himself with the transpersonal field, citing what he found to be deep and irreconcilable confusions in the field [52]\n\n\nCriticisms and responses\nWhile receiving attention in publications on humanistic and transpersonal psychology in the 1980s and early 1990s, since the publication of Sex, Ecology, Spirituality in 1995 Wilber's work has mostly been discussed in alternative and non-academic fora and websites [web 1]  [web 2] While responding to criticisms in Ken Wilber in Dialogue (1998), Wilber has mostly ignored criticisms of his work [web 1] In 2006 Wilber created a great deal of controversy when he argued in a derisive tone that many of the critiques he received were simply ad hominem and also failed to understand his model [55] It was argued this essay \"insulted his critics, degrading and dismissing them by basically stating that he was smarter than everybody else.\" [web 3]\n\n\nInfluence\nWilber's work began to draw attention from people interested in 'integral thinking' following the completion of Sex, Ecology, Spirituality in 1995 [2] Some individuals affiliated with Ken Wilber have said that there exists a loosely defined \"Integral movement\" [68] Others, however, have disagreed [69] Whatever its status as a \"movement\", there are a variety of religious organizations, think tanks, conferences, [note 9] workshops, and publications in the US and internationally that utilize the term integral and that explicitly refer to Wilber's definition of the term \n\n\nIntegral movement\nWilber's work began to draw attention

published twelve books in their \"SUNY series in Integral Theory\" in the early 2010s [7] A select group of the white papers submitted for the 2008 integral conference were edited and compiled by Esbjörn-Hargens  and published in 2010 in the SUNY series as Integral Theory in Action in Integral Theory, [73]\n\n\nAlternative approaches\nBonnitta Roy has introduced a process model of integral theory, combining Western process philosophy, Dzogchen ideas, and Wilberian theory She distinguishes between Wilber's concept of perspective and the Dzogchen concept of view, arguing that Wilber's view is situated within a framework or structural enfoldment which constrains it, in contrast to the Dzogchen intention of being mindful of view [82] [third-party source needed]\n\n\nSee

integral thought, is a comprehensive and systematic framework for understanding and integrating various disciplines, including philosophy, psychology, spirituality, and science. It was developed by Ken Wilber, an American philosopher and author, who aimed to create a metatheory that would encompass and reconcile all existing knowledge and experiences.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nIntegral theory is a complex and multifaceted concept that has been developed over several decades by Ken Wilber. It is a synthesis of various philosophical, psychological, and spiritual traditions, and it seeks to provide a comprehensive and systematic understanding of human experience and the nature of reality. Integral theory has been influential in various fields, including psychology, education, and spirituality, and it has been applied in a wide range of contexts, including personal growth, organizational development, and social change.\n\n**Origins**\n\nThe origins of integral theory date back to the 1970s, when Ken Wilber began to synthesize various Eastern and Western philosophical and spiritual traditions. Wilber's early work was influenced by the writings of Sri Aurobindo, a Indian philosopher and yogi, and he drew heavily from Aurobindo's concept of the integral yoga. The integral yoga is a spiritual practice that seeks to unify the individual with the divine, and it is based on the idea that human beings have a multidimensional nature that can be developed and integrated through various practices and disciplines.\n\n**Main Influences**\n\nThe integral yoga of Sri Aurobindo describes five levels of being, which are:\n\n1. **Physical**: The physical body and its functions\n2. **Vital**: The vital energy and its functions\n3. **Mental**: The mental body and its functions\n4. **Psychic**: The psychic body and its functions\n5. **Supermind**: The superconscious or spiritual body and its functions\n\nThese levels of being are often associated with the five koshas or sheaths, which are:\n\n1. **Annamaya kosha**: The physical body\n2. **Pranamaya kosha**: The vital energy\n3. **Manomaya kosha**: The mental body\n4. **Vijnanamaya kosha**: The psychic body\n5. **Anandamaya kosha**: The superconscious or spiritual body\n\nThe integral yoga also describes three types of being, which are:\n\n1. **Outer being**: The physical and vital aspects of human nature\n2. **Inner being**: The mental and psychic aspects of human nature\n3. **Psychic being**: The higher reaches of the mental and psychic aspects of human nature\n\n**Structural Stage Theory**\n\nStructural stage theories are based on the observation that humans develop through a pattern of distinct stages over time. These stages are characterized by a particular type of structure of mental processes, and they have a constant order of succession. Later stages integrate the achievements of earlier stages, and each stage builds on the previous one.\n\nPiaget's theory of cognitive development is a classic example of a structural stage theory. According to Piaget, children progress through a series of stages, each characterized by a different level of cognitive development. These stages are:\n\n1. **Sensorimotor stage**: The stage of sensorimotor development, during which children learn to coordinate their sensory experiences with their motor activities\n2. **Preoperational stage**: The stage of preoperational development, during which children begin to use symbols and language to represent the world\n3. **Concrete operational stage**: The stage of concrete operational development, during which children begin to use logical operations to solve problems\n4. **Formal operational stage**: The stage of formal operational development, during which children begin to use abstract thinking and hypothetical reasoning\n\n**Jean Gebser - Mutations of Consciousness**\n\nJean Gebser, a Swiss phenomenologist and interdisciplinary scholar, is another key figure in the development of integral theory. Gebser's concept of the \"mutations of consciousness\" refers to the idea that human consciousness undergoes a series of transformations or mutations as it evolves. These mutations are characterized by a shift from one level of consciousness to another, and they are often associated with major cultural and historical transitions.\n\nGebser's model of consciousness is based on the idea that human beings have a multidimensional nature that can be developed and integrated through various practices and disciplines. His model describes four stages of consciousness, which are:\n\n1. **Rational**: The rational stage of consciousness, characterized by a focus on logical reasoning and analytical thinking\n2. **Magic**: The magical stage of consciousness, characterized by a focus on imagination and creativity\n3. **Mythic**: The mythic stage of consciousness, characterized by a focus on storytelling and symbolic thinking\n4. **Integral**: The integral stage of consciousness, characterized by a focus on holistic thinking and integrative understanding\n\n**Spiral Dynamics and Collaboration with Don Beck**\n\nKen Wilber's work on integral theory has been influenced by the work of Don Beck, an American psychologist and author. Beck's concept of Spiral Dynamics is based on the idea that human consciousness undergoes a series of stages or spirals as it evolves. These spirals are characterized by a shift from one level of consciousness to another, and they are often associated with major cultural and historical transitions.\n\nWilber and Beck have collaborated on several projects, including the development of Spiral Dynamics. Their work has been influential in various fields, including psychology, education, and spirituality.\n\n**Wilber's Metatheory**\n\nKen Wilber's metatheory is a comprehensive and systematic framework for understanding and integrating various disciplines, including philosophy, psychology, spirituality, and science. His metatheory is based on the idea that human beings have a multidimensional nature that can be developed and integrated through various practices and disciplines.\n\nWilber's metatheory consists of five fundamental concepts, which are often referred to as the five elements. These elements are:\n\n1. **The four quadrant model**: A model that describes the four dimensions of human experience, which are:\n\t* **Interior**: The internal or subjective dimension, which includes the individual's thoughts, feelings, and experiences\n\t* **Exterior**: The external or objective dimension, which includes the individual's relationships with the environment and other people\n\t* **Individual**: The individual or personal dimension, which includes the individual's unique characteristics and experiences\n\t* **Collective**: The collective or social dimension, which includes the individual's relationships with the group and society\n2. **Levels of development**: A model that describes the various stages of human development, which are:\n\t* **Biological**: The biological stage of development, which includes the individual's physical and biological growth\n\t* **Psychological**: The psychological stage of development, which includes the individual's cognitive and emotional growth\n\t* **Spiritual**: The spiritual stage of development, which includes the individual's growth in awareness and understanding\n3. **Lines of development**: A model that describes the various lines or domains of human development, which are:\n\t* **Cognitive**: The cognitive line of development, which includes the individual's intellectual and analytical abilities\n\t* **Ethical**: The ethical line of development, which includes the individual's moral and values-based abilities\n\t* **Aesthetic**: The aesthetic line of development, which includes the individual's creative and artistic abilities\n4. **States of consciousness**: A model that describes the various states or levels of consciousness, which are:\n\t* **Waking**: The waking state of consciousness, which is characterized by awareness and alertness\n\t* **Dreaming**: The dreaming state of consciousness, which is characterized by imagination and creativity\n\t* **Sleeping**: The sleeping state of consciousness, which is characterized by relaxation and restoration\n5. **Types**: A model that describes the various types or styles of human development, which are:\n\t* **Masculine**: The masculine type, which is characterized by logic and analysis\n\t* **Feminine**: The feminine type, which is characterized by intuition and creativity\n\n**Holons**\n\nKen Wilber's concept of holons refers to the idea that human beings are composed of multiple levels of reality, which are interconnected and interdependent. Holons are like Russian dolls, where each layer contains a smaller version of itself, and each layer is nested within a larger whole.\n\nWilber's concept of holons is based on the idea that human beings have a multidimensional nature that can be developed and integrated through various practices and disciplines. His concept of holons is a key aspect of his metatheory, and it provides a framework for understanding the complex and multifaceted nature of human experience.\n\n**Reception**\n\nKen Wilber's work on integral theory has been influential in various fields, including psychology, education, and spirituality. However, his work has also been criticized for its complexity and lack of clarity.\n\nSome critics have argued that Wilber's work is too abstract and theoretical, and that it lacks practical applications and empirical evidence. Others have argued that Wilber's work is too focused on individual development and neglects the role of social and cultural factors in shaping human experience.\n\nDespite these criticisms, Wilber's work remains an important contribution to the field of integral theory, and his ideas continue to influence scholars and practitioners in various fields.\n\n**Influence**\n\nKen Wilber's work on integral theory has had a significant impact on various fields, including psychology, education, and spirituality. His ideas have influenced scholars and practitioners in various areas, including:\n\n* **Integral psychology**: Wilber's work on integral psychology has influenced the development of integral psychology as a field, and has provided a framework for understanding the complex and multifaceted nature of human experience.\n* **Integral education**: Wilber's work on integral education has influenced the development of integral education, and has provided a framework for understanding the complex and multifaceted nature of learning and development.\n* **Spirituality**: Wilber's work on spirituality has influenced the development of spirituality as a field, and has provided a framework for understanding the complex and multifaceted nature of spiritual experience.\n\n**Applications and Publications**\n\nKen Wilber's work on integral theory has been applied in various contexts, including:\n\n* **Personal growth**: Wilber's work has been applied in various contexts, including personal growth and development, and has provided a framework for understanding the complex and multifaceted nature of human experience.\n* **Organizational development**: Wilber's work has been applied in various contexts, including organizational development, and has provided a framework for understanding the complex and multifaceted nature of organizational behavior.\n* **Social change**: Wilber's work has been applied in various contexts, including social change, and has provided a framework for understanding the complex and multifaceted nature of social behavior.\n\n**Alternative Approaches**\n\nThere are various alternative approaches to integral theory, including:\n\n* **Bonnitta Roy's process model**: Bonnitta Roy's process model of integral theory provides a framework for understanding the complex and multifaceted nature of human experience, and emphasizes the importance of process and transformation in human development.\n* **Dzogchen**: Dzogchen is a Tibetan Buddhist tradition that emphasizes the importance of direct experience and awareness in spiritual development, and provides a framework for understanding the complex and multifaceted nature of spiritual experience.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* **Integral philosophy**: Integral philosophy is a branch of philosophy that emphasizes the importance of integrating various disciplines and perspectives in understanding human experience.\n* **Integral psychology**: Integral psychology is a branch of psychology that emphasizes the importance of integrating various disciplines and perspectives in understanding human behavior and development.\n* **Spirituality**: Spirituality is a branch of philosophy that emphasizes the importance of spiritual experience and awareness in understanding human experience.\n\nNote: This article is a comprehensive overview of integral theory and its various aspects.

theory, models of psychology development that describe human development as following a set course of stages of development [10]\n\n\nOrigins\nKen Wilber's integral theory is a synthetic metatheory, a theory whose subject matter he intended to organize and integrate pre-existing theories themselves, doing so in a clear and systematic way [2] A synthetic metatheory \"classifies whole theories according to some overarching typology.\" [8] Wilber's metatheory started in the 1970s, with the publication of The Spectrum of Consciousness (1977), synthesizing Eastern religious traditions with Western schools of psychotherapy and Western developmental psychology [9] In The Atman Project (1980), this spectrum was presented as a developmental model, akin to western structural stage theory, models of psychology development that describe human development as following a set course of stages of development [10]\n\n\nMain influences\nThe integral yoga of Sri Aurobindo describes five levels of being (physical; vital; mind or mental being; the higher reaches of mind or psychic being; Supermind), akin to the five koshas or sheaths, and three types of being (outer being, inner being, psychic being) The psychic being refers to the higher reaches of mind (higher mind, illuminated mind, intuition, overmind) It correlates with buddhi, the connecting element between purusha and prakriti in Samkhya, and correlated by Wilber with his transpersonal stages Aurobindo focuses on spiritual development and the process of unifying of all parts of one's being with the Divine As described by Sri Aurobindo and his co-worker The Mother (1878–1973), this spiritual teaching involves an integral divine transformation of the entire being, rather than the liberation of only a single faculty such as the intellect or the emotions or the body [15] [third-party source needed]\n\n\nSri Aurobindo\nThe integral yoga of Sri Aurobindo describes five levels of being (physical; vital; mind

emotions or the body [15] [third-party source needed]\n\n\nStructural stage theory\nStructural stage theories are based on the observation that humans develop through a pattern of distinct stages over time, and that these stages can be described based on their distinguishing characteristics In Piaget's theory of cognitive development, and related models like those of James Mark Baldwin, Jane Loevinger, Robert Kegan, Lawrence Kohlberg, and James W Fowler, stages have a constant order of succession, later stages integrate the achievements of earlier stages, and each is characterized by a particular type of structure of mental processes which is specific to it The time of appearance may vary to a certain extent depending upon environmental conditions [16]\n\n\nJean Gebser - mutations of consciousness\nThe word integral was independently suggested by Jean Gebser (1905–1973), a Swiss phenomenologist and interdisciplinary scholar, in 1939 to describe his own intuition regarding the structure of human consciousness that would follow the modern or mental structure Gebser was the author of The Ever-Present Origin, which describes human history as a series of mutations in consciousness He only afterwards discovered the similarity between his own ideas and those of Sri Aurobindo and Teilhard de Chardin [17]\n\n\nSpiral Dynamics and collaboration with Don Beck\nAfter completing Sex, Ecology, Spirituality (1995), Ken Wilber started to collaborate with Don Beck, whose Spiral Dynamics is based on the work of Clare W Graves, and which shows strong correlations with Wilber's model [20] Beck and Christopher Cowan had published their application and extension of Graves's work in 1996 in Spiral Dynamics: Mastering Values, Leadership, and Change [21] Wilber also referenced Graves's emergent cyclical levels of existence in Sex, Ecology, Spirituality, when he introduced his quadrant model, [note 2] and began to incorporate Spiral Dynamics in the \"Integral Psychology\" section of The Collected Works of Ken Wilber (Vol 4) in 1999, [22] and gave it a prominent place in the 2000 edition of A Theory of Everything [23]\n\n\nWilber's metatheory\nIn Sex, Ecology, Spirituality (1995), Wilber introduced his AQAL (All Quadrants All Levels All Lines All States All Types) metatheory, a framework which consists of five fundamental concepts, sometimes called the five elements This includes the four quadrant model, levels of development, lines of development, states of consciousness, as well as the notion of types In this schema the four quadrant model is foundational, and the remaining four elements are then added to flesh out topics more fully [30] According to Wilber, the AQAL model is one of the most comprehensive approaches to reality, a metatheory in which all academic disciplines and every form of knowledge and experience fit together coherently [13]\n\n\nFour quadrants\n\"I\"\nInterior Individual\nIntentional\n\n\nLevels or stages\nThe basis of Wilber's theory is his developmental model Wilber's model follows the discrete structural stages of development, as described in the structural stage theories of developmental psychology, including but-not-limited to Loevinger's stages of ego development, [40] Piaget's theory of cognitive development, [41] [42] Kohlberg's stages of moral development, [43] Erikson's stages of psychosocial development, [41] and Fowler's stages of spiritual development [citation needed]\n\n\nLines, streams, or intelligences\nAccording to Wilber, various domains or lines of development, or intelligences can be discerned [44] They include cognitive, ethical, aesthetic, spiritual, kinesthetic, affective, musical, spatial, and logical-mathematical For example, one can be highly developed cognitively (cerebrally smart) without being highly developed morally (as in the case of Nazi doctors) [citation needed]\n\n\nStates\nStates are temporary states of consciousness, such as waking, dreaming and sleeping, bodily sensations, and drug-induced and meditation-induced states Some states are interpreted as temporary intimations of higher stages of development [45] [46] Wilber's formulation is: \"States are free, structures are earned\" [47] A person has to build or earn structure; it cannot be peak-experienced for free What can be peak-experienced, however, are higher states of freedom from the stage a person is habituated to, so these deeper or higher states can be experienced at any level [note 7]\n\n\nTypes\nTypes are models and theories that do not fit into Wilber's other categorizations Wilber makes types part of his model in order to point out that these distinctions are different from the already mentioned distinctions: quadrants, lines, levels and states [48] They are styles, emphases, or interpretations that influence a person's or a culture's perspectives, but that are non-hierarchical and non-normative No type is in-and-of-itself better than another Examples includes masculine/feminine typologies, the nine Enneagram categories, and Jung's psychological typologies All types are considered potentially valid, though Wilber also argued the evidence for types is somewhat less persuasive than the four other elements of AQAL theory [2]\n\n\nHolons\nHolons are the individual building blocks of Wilber's model Wilber borrowed the concept of holons from Arthur Koestler's description of the great chain of being, a mediaeval description of levels of being \"Holon\" means that every entity and concept is both an entity on its own, and a hierarchical part of a larger whole For example, a cell in an organism is both a whole as a cell, and at the same time a part of another whole, the organism Likewise a letter is a self-existing entity and simultaneously an integral part of a word, which then is part of a sentence, which is part of a paragraph, which is part of a page; and so on Everything from quarks to matter to energy to ideas can be looked at in this way The relation between individuals and society is not the same as between cells and organisms though, because individual holons can be members but not parts of social holons [note 6]\n\n\nReception\nAccording to Frank Visser, Wilber's early work was praised by transpersonal psychologists, but support for Wilber \"even in transpersonal circles\" had waned by the early 1990s [51] In 2002 Wilber stated that he had long since stopped identifying himself with the transpersonal field, citing what he found to be deep and irreconcilable confusions in the field [52]\n\n\nReception in mainstream academia\nAccording to Frank Visser, Wilber's early work was praised by transpersonal psychologists, but support for Wilber \"even in transpersonal circles\" had waned by the early 1990s [51] In 2002 Wilber stated that he had long since stopped identifying himself with the transpersonal field, citing what he found to be deep and irreconcilable confusions in the field [52]\n\n\nCriticisms and responses\nWhile receiving attention in publications on humanistic and transpersonal psychology in the 1980s and early 1990s, since the publication of Sex, Ecology, Spirituality in 1995 Wilber's work has mostly been discussed in alternative and non-academic fora and websites [web 1]  [web 2] While responding to criticisms in Ken Wilber in Dialogue (1998), Wilber has mostly ignored criticisms of his work [web 1] In 2006 Wilber created a great deal of controversy when he argued in a derisive tone that many of the critiques he received were simply ad hominem and also failed to understand his model [55] It was argued this essay \"insulted his critics, degrading and dismissing them by basically stating that he was smarter than everybody else.\" [web 3]\n\n\nInfluence\nWilber's work began to draw attention from people interested in 'integral thinking' following the completion of Sex, Ecology, Spirituality in 1995 [2] Some individuals affiliated with Ken Wilber have said that there exists a loosely defined \"Integral movement\" [68] Others, however, have disagreed [69] Whatever its status as a \"movement\", there are a variety of religious organizations, think tanks, conferences, [note 9] workshops, and publications in the US and internationally that utilize the term integral and that explicitly refer to Wilber's definition of the term \n\n\nIntegral movement\nWilber's work began to draw attention from people interested in 'integral thinking' following the completion of Sex, Ecology, Spirituality in 1995 [2] Some individuals

the term \n\n\nApplications and publications\nSUNY Press published twelve books in their \"SUNY series in Integral Theory\" in the early 2010s [7] A select group of the white papers submitted for the 2008 integral conference were edited and compiled by Esbjörn-Hargens  and published in 2010 in the SUNY series as Integral Theory in Action in Integral Theory, [73]\n\n\nAlternative approaches\nBonnitta Roy has introduced a process model of integral theory, combining Western process philosophy, Dzogchen ideas, and Wilberian theory She distinguishes between Wilber's concept of perspective and the Dzogchen concept of view, arguing that Wilber's view is situated within a framework or structural enfoldment which constrains it, in contrast to the Dzogchen intention of being mindful of view [82] [third-party source needed]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born into slavery in Tennessee in 1854, Love would go on to become one of the most famous African American cowboys of his time.\n\n## Early Life\n\nNat Love was born on June 14, 1854, into slavery on the plantation of Robert Love in Davidson County, Tennessee. His father was a slave foreman who worked in the plantation's fields, and his mother managed the plantation's kitchen. Love had two siblings, an older sister named Sally and an older brother named Jordan. Despite being born into slavery, Love's family was relatively well-off, with his father holding a position of authority on the plantation.\n\nGrowing up on the plantation, Love was exposed to the harsh realities of slavery and racism. However, he also learned valuable skills, such as horsemanship and farming, which would serve him well in his future endeavors. Love's early life was marked by a sense of curiosity and a desire for adventure, which would eventually lead him to leave the plantation and strike out on his own.\n\n## Life as a Cowboy\n\nIn 1872, Love traveled to Dodge City, Kansas, where he found work as a cowboy with cattle drivers from the Duval Ranch, located in the Texas Panhandle. Love quickly proved himself to be a skilled and capable cowboy, earning the respect of his peers and the nickname \"Red River Dick.\" He spent several years working on cattle drives, facing numerous challenges and dangers along the way, including inclement weather and cattle rustlers.\n\nDuring his time as a cowboy, Love met and befriended several notable figures, including Pat Garrett, Bat Masterson, and Billy the Kid. He also claimed to have entered a rodeo in Deadwood, Dakota Territory, in 1876, where he won several contests and earned the nickname \"Deadwood Dick.\" However, this story has been disputed by historians, who point out that Deadwood newspapers make no mention of a rodeo on the Fourth of July that year.\n\n## Capture and Escape\n\nDespite his many adventures as a cowboy, Love's life was not without its challenges. He was eventually captured by ranchers who accused him of theft, but he escaped and made his way back to his brother's ranch. Love's escape was marked by a sense of determination and resourcefulness, as he navigated the treacherous terrain and evaded capture.\n\n## Life After Being a Cowboy\n\nIn the late 1880s, Love left the cowboy life and settled down, marrying a woman named Alice Owens in Denver, Colorado. He took a job as a Pullman porter, overseeing sleeping cars on the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad. Love and his family resided in several western states, including Colorado, Utah, and California, before finally settling in southern California.\n\n## In Popular Culture\n\nNat Love's life and adventures have been immortalized in popular culture, including literature, film, and television. Joe R. Lansdale used Love as a character in several of his stories, including \"Nine Hide and Horns\" and \"Paradise Sky.\" Ernie Hudson portrayed Love in the television movie \"The Cherokee Kid\" in 1996.\n\n## Written Works\n\nIn addition to his adventures as a cowboy and Pullman porter, Love also wrote an autobiography, which provides a firsthand account of his life and experiences. His writing offers a unique perspective on the history of the American West and the struggles of African Americans during the late 19th century.\n\n## Film\n\nNat Love's life and adventures have been depicted in several films and television shows, including \"The Cherokee Kid\" and \"Deadwood.\" These productions offer a glimpse into the life of this fascinating figure and his contributions to the history of the American West.\n\n## See Also\n\n* African American cowboys\n* Cattle drives\n* Deadwood, Dakota Territory\n* Pullman porters\n* Robert Love\n* Texas Panhandle\n\n## Notes\n\nNat Love's life and adventures offer a fascinating glimpse into the history of the American West and the struggles of African Americans during the late 19th century.

{"title": "Good_Friday", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe term Good Friday comes from the sense 'pious, holy' of the word good [11] Less common examples of expressions based on this obsolete sense of good include 'the good book\" for the Bible, 'good tide' for Christmas or Shrovetide, and Good Wednesday for the Wednesday in Holy Week [12] A common folk etymology incorrectly analyzes Good Friday as a corruption of God Friday, similar to the linguistically correct description of goodbye as a contraction of 'God be with ye' [13] In Old English, the day was called Long Friday (langa frigedæg  [ˈlɑŋɡɑ ˈfriːjedæj]), [clarification needed] and equivalents of this term are still used in Scandinavian languages and Finnish [14]\n\n\nBiblical accounts\nAccording to the accounts in the Gospels, the royal soldiers, guided by Jesus' disciple Judas Iscariot, arrested Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane Judas received money (30 pieces of silver)  [15] for betraying Jesus and told the guards that whomever he kisses is the one they are to arrest Following his arrest, Jesus was taken to the house of Annas, the father-in-law of the high priest, Caiaphas There he was interrogated with little result and sent bound to Caiaphas the high priest where the Sanhedrin had assembled [16]\n\n\nEastern Orthodox\nByzantine Christians (Eastern Christians who follow the Rite of Constantinople: Orthodox Christians and Greek-Catholics) call this day \"Great and Holy Friday\", or simply \"Great Friday\" [38] Because the sacrifice of Jesus through his crucifixion is recalled on this day, the Divine Liturgy (the sacrifice of bread and wine) is never celebrated on Great Friday, except when this day coincides with the Great Feast of the Annunciation, which falls on the fixed date of 25 March (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar, 25 March currently falls on 7 April of the modern Gregorian Calendar) Also on Great Friday, the clergy no longer wear the purple or red that is customary throughout Great Lent, [39] but instead don black vestments There is no \"stripping of the altar\" on Holy and Great Thursday as in the West; instead, all of the church hangings are changed to black, and will remain so until the Divine Liturgy on Great Saturday [40] [41]\n\n\nMatins of Holy and Great Friday\nThe Byzantine Christian observance of Holy and Great Friday, which is formally known as The Order of Holy and Saving Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, begins on Thursday night with the Matins of the Twelve Passion Gospels Scattered throughout this Matins service are twelve readings from all four of the Gospels which recount the events of the Passion from the Last Supper through the Crucifixion and burial of Jesus Some churches have a candelabrum with twelve candles on it, and after each Gospel reading one of the candles is extinguished [43]\n\n\nRoyal Hours\nThe next day, in the forenoon on Friday, all gather again to pray the Royal Hours, [47] a special expanded celebration of the Little Hours (including the First Hour, Third Hour, Sixth Hour, Ninth Hour and Typica) with the addition of scripture readings (Old Testament, Epistle and Gospel) and hymns about the Crucifixion at each of the Hours (some of the material from the previous night is repeated) This is somewhat more festive in character, and derives its name of \"Royal\" from both the fact that the Hours are served with more solemnity than normal, commemorating Christ the King who humbled himself for the salvation of mankind, and also from the fact that this service was in the past attended by the Emperor and his court [48]\n\n\nVespers of Holy and Great Friday\nIn the afternoon, around 3 pm, all gather for the Vespers of the Taking-Down from the Cross, [49] commemorating the Deposition from the Cross Following Psalm 103 (104) and the Great Litany, 'Lord, I call' is sung without a Psalter reading The first five stichera (the first being repeated) are taken from the Aposticha at Matins the night before, but the final 3 of the 5 are sung in Tone 2 Three more stichera in Tone 6 lead to the Entrance The Evening Prokimenon is taken from Psalm 21 (22): 'They parted My garments among them, and cast lots upon My vesture.'\n\n\nMatins of Holy and Great Saturday\nOn Friday night, the Matins of Holy and Great Saturday, a unique service known as The Lamentation at the Tomb [52] (Epitáphios Thrēnos) is celebrated This service is also sometimes called Jerusalem Matins Much of the service takes place around the tomb of Christ in the center of the nave [53]\n\n\nRoman Catholic\nIn Latin, the name used by the Catholic Church until 1955 was Feria sexta in Parasceve (\"Friday of Preparation  [for the Sabbath]\") In the 1955 reform of Holy Week, it was renamed Feria sexta in Passione et Morte Domini (\"Friday of the Passion and Death of the Lord\"), and in the new rite introduced in 1970, shortened to Feria sexta in Passione Domini (\"Friday of the Passion of the Lord\") [57]\n\n\nDay of Fasting\nThe Catholic Church regards Good Friday and Holy Saturday as the Paschal fast, in accordance with Article 110 of Sacrosanctum Concilium [58] In the Latin Church, a fast day is understood as having only one full meal and two collations (a smaller repast, the two of which together do not equal the one full meal) [59] [60] – although this may be observed less stringently on Holy Saturday than on Good Friday [58]\n\n\nServices on the day\nThe Roman Rite has no celebration of Mass between the Mass of the Lord's Supper on Holy Thursday (Maundy Thursday) evening and the Easter Vigil unless a special exemption is granted for rare solemn or grave occasions by the Vatican or the local bishop The only sacraments celebrated during this time are Baptism (for those in danger of death), Penance, and Anointing of the Sick [61] While there is no celebration of the Eucharist, it is distributed to the faithful only in the Celebration of the Passion of the Lord, but can also be taken at any hour to the sick who are unable to attend this celebration [62]\n\n\nThree Hours' Agony\nThe Three Hours' Devotion based on the Seven Last Words from the Cross begins at noon and ends at 3 pm, the time that the Christian tradition teaches that Jesus died on the cross [72]\n\n\nLiturgy\nThe Good Friday liturgy consists of three parts: the Liturgy of the Word, the Veneration of the Cross, and the Holy Communion.\n\n\nStations of the Cross\nIn addition to the prescribed liturgical service, the Stations of the Cross are often prayed either in the church or outside, and a prayer service may be held from midday to 3.00 pm, known as the Three Hours' Agony [81] In countries such as Malta, Italy, the Philippines, Puerto Rico and Spain, processions with statues representing the Passion of Christ are held [82] [83] [84] [85] [86]\n\n\nPlenary indulgence\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, plenary indulgence is obtained if the faithful venerates the cross with piety in the solemn Celebration of the Passion of the Lord on Good Friday [88]\n\n\nNovena to the Divine Mercy\nThe novena to the Divine Mercy begins on that day and lasts until the Saturday before Divine Mercy Sunday Both days are linked in terms of content, as the mercy of God flows from the Sacred Heart of Jesus that was pierced on the cross [89] [90]\n\n\nProtestant\nIn Lutheran tradition from the 16th to the 20th century, Good Friday was the most important religious holiday, and abstention from all worldly works was expected During that time, Lutheranism had no restrictions on the celebration of the Eucharist on Good Friday; on the contrary, it was a prime day on which to receive the Eucharist, and services were often accentuated by special music such as the St Matthew Passion by Johann Sebastian Bach [91]\n\n\nLutheran Church\nIn Lutheran tradition from the 16th to the 20th century, Good Friday was the most important religious holiday, and abstention from all worldly works was expected During that time, Lutheranism had no restrictions on the celebration of the Eucharist on Good Friday; on the contrary, it was a prime day on which to receive the Eucharist, and services were often accentuated by special music such as the St Matthew Passion by Johann Sebastian Bach [91]\n\n\nAnglican Communion\nIn the Anglican Communion, the Black Fast has been historically observed by devout believers [95] The Black Fast was especially popular during the 19th century as it sought to imitate \"the fasting of the ancient church.\" [95]\n\n\nMethodist Church\nMany Methodist denominations commemorate Good Friday with fasting, [3] [97] as well as a service of worship based on the Seven Last Words from the Cross; this liturgy is known as the Three Hours Devotion as it starts at noon and concludes at 3 pm, the latter being the time that Jesus died on the cross [98] [99]\n\n\nMoravian Church\nMoravians hold a Lovefeast on Good Friday as they receive Holy Communion on Maundy Thursday.\n\n\nReformed Churches\nIn the Reformed tradition, Good Friday is one of the evangelical feasts and is thus widely observed with church services, which feature the Solemn Reproaches in the pattern of Psalm 78, towards the end of the liturgy [101]\n\n\nOther Christian traditions\nMany Protestant churches hold an Interdenominational service with Lord's Supper [102]\n\n\nAssociated customs\nIn many countries and territories with a strong Christian tradition such as Australia, Bermuda, Brazil, Canada, the countries of the Caribbean, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Malta, Mexico, New Zealand, [103] [104] [105] Peru, the Philippines, Portugal, the Scandinavian countries, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela, the day is observed as a public or federal holiday In the United States, 12 states observe Good Friday as state holiday: Connecticut, Texas, Delaware, Hawaii, Indiana, Tennessee, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina and North Dakota One associated custom is strict adherence to the Black Fast, where believers fast from food and liquids during the day and after sunset, a vegetarian meal with water is consumed [106] [107] [108] St Ambrose, St Chrysostom and St Basil attest to the practice [109]\n\n\nAustralia\nGood Friday is a holiday under state and territory laws in all states and territories in Australia [110] Generally speaking, shops in all Australian states (but not in the two territories of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory) are required to remain closed for the duration of Good Friday, although there are certain shops which are permitted to open and other shops can apply for exemptions All schools and universities close on Good Friday in Australia, and Good Friday falls within the school holidays in most years in all states and territories except the Northern Territory, although many states now commence their school holidays in early April regardless of Easter In 2024, for example, when Good Friday fell on 29 March, only Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia had school holidays which coincided with Good Friday [111] The vast majority of businesses are closed on Good Friday, although many recreational businesses, such as the Sydney Royal Easter Show, open on Good Friday as among non-religious families Good Friday is a popular day to indulge in such activities.\n\n\nCanada\nIn Canada, Good Friday is a federal statutory holiday In the province of Quebec \"employers can choose to give the day off either on Good Friday or Easter Monday.\" [112]\n\n\nCuba\nIn an online article posted on Catholic News Agency by Alejandro Bermúdez on 31 March 2012, Cuban President Raúl Castro, with the Communist Party and his advisers, decreed that Good Friday that year would be a holiday This was Castro's response to a request made personally to him by Pope Benedict XVI during the latter's Apostolic Visitation to the island and León, Mexico that month The move followed the pattern of small advances in Cuba's relations with the Vatican, mirroring Pope John Paul II's success in getting Fidel Castro to declare Christmas Day a holiday [113] Both Good Friday and Christmas are now annual holidays in Cuba.\n\n\nHong Kong\nIn Hong Kong, Good Friday was designated a public holiday in the Holidays Ordinance, 1875 [114] Good Friday continues to be a holiday after the transfer of sovereignty from the UK to China in 1997 [115] Government offices, banks, post offices and most offices are closed on Good Friday.\n\n\nIreland\nIn the Republic of Ireland, Good Friday is not an official public holiday, but most non-retail businesses close for the day Up until 2018 it was illegal to sell alcoholic beverages on Good Friday, with some exceptions, so pubs and off-licences generally closed [116] Critics of the ban included the catering and tourism sector, but surveys showed that the general public were divided on the issue [117] [118] In Northern Ireland, a similar ban operates until 5 pm on Good Friday [119]\n\n\nMalaysia\nAlthough Malaysia is a Muslim majority country, Good Friday is declared as a public holiday in the states of Sabah and Sarawak in East Malaysia as there is a significant Christian indigenous population in both states [120]\n\n\nMalta\nThe Holy Week commemorations reach their peak on Good Friday as the Roman Catholic Church celebrates the passion of Jesus Solemn celebrations take place in all churches together with processions in different villages around Malta and Gozo During the celebration, the narrative of the passion is read in some localities, while the Adoration of the Cross follows Good Friday processions take place in Birgu, Bormla, Għaxaq, Luqa, Mosta, Naxxar, Paola, Qormi, Rabat, Senglea, Valletta, Żebbuġ (Città Rohan) and Żejtun Processions in Gozo will be in Nadur, Victoria (St George and Cathedral), Xagħra and Żebbuġ, Gozo [citation needed]\n\n\nNew Zealand\nIn New Zealand, Good Friday is a legal holiday [121] and is a day of mandatory school closure for all New Zealand state and integrated schools [122] Good Friday is also a restricted trading day in New Zealand, which means that unexempted shops are not permitted to open on this day [123]\n\n\nPhilippines\nIn the predominantly Roman Catholic Philippines, the day is commemorated with street processions, the Way of the Cross, the chanting of the Pasyón, and performances of the Senákulo or Passion play Some devotees engage in self-flagellation and even have themselves crucified as expressions of penance despite health risks and strong disapproval from the Church [124]\n\n\nPoland\nIn Polish churches, a tableau of Christ's Tomb is unveiled in the sanctuary Many of the faithful spend long hours into the night grieving at the Tomb, where it is customary to kiss the wounds on the Lord's body A life-size figure of Jesus lying in his tomb is widely visited by the faithful, especially on Holy Saturday The tableaux may include flowers, candles, figures of angels standing watch, and the three crosses atop Mt Calvary, and much more Each parish strives to come up with the most artistically and religiously evocative arrangement in which the Blessed Sacrament, draped in a filmy veil, is prominently displayed [citation needed]\n\n\nSingapore\nGood Friday is a public holiday in Singapore [127] [128]\n\n\nSpain\nIn the UK, Good Friday was historically a common law holiday and is recognised as an official public holiday [130] (also known as a Bank Holiday) All state schools are closed and most businesses treat it as a holiday for staff; however, many retail stores now remain open Government services in Northern Ireland operate as normal on Good Friday, substituting Easter Tuesday for the holiday.\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nIn the UK, Good Friday was historically a common law holiday and is recognised as an official public holiday [130] (also known as a Bank Holiday) All state schools are closed and most businesses treat it as a holiday for staff; however, many retail stores now remain open Government services in Northern Ireland operate as normal on Good Friday, substituting Easter Tuesday for the holiday.\n\n\nUnited States\nIn the United States, Good Friday is not a government holiday at the federal level, because it is a secular country [135] The postal service operates, and banks regulated by the federal government do not close for Good Friday [136]\n\n\nCalculating the date\nGood Friday is the Friday before Easter, which is calculated differently in Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity (see Computus for details) Easter falls on the first Sunday following the Paschal Full Moon, the full moon on or after 21 March, taken to be the date of the vernal equinox The Western calculation uses the Gregorian calendar, while the Eastern calculation uses the Julian calendar, whose 21 March now corresponds to the Gregorian calendar's 3 April The calculations for identifying the date of the full moon also differ [citation needed]\n\n\nCultural references\nGood Friday assumes a particular importance in the plot of Richard Wagner's music drama Parsifal, which contains an orchestral interlude known as the \"Good Friday Music\" [161]\n\n\nMemoration on Wednesday of the Holy Week\nSome Baptist congregations, [162] the Philadelphia Church of God, [163] and some non-denominational churches oppose the observance of Good Friday, regarding it as a so-called \"papist\" tradition, and instead observe the Crucifixion of Jesus on Wednesday to coincide with the Jewish sacrifice of the Passover Lamb (which some/many Christians believe is an Old Testament pointer to Jesus Christ) A Wednesday Crucifixion of Jesus allows for him to be in the tomb (\"heart of the earth\") for three days and three nights as he told the Pharisees he would be (Matthew 12:40), rather than two nights and a day (by inclusive counting, as was the norm at that time) if he had died on a Friday [164] [165]\n\n\nSee also\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays,

As well as a service of worship based on the Seven Last Words from the Cross; this liturgy is known as the Three Hours Devotion as it starts at noon and concludes at 3 pm, the latter being the time that Jesus died on the cross.\n\n**Moravian Church**\n\nMoravians hold a Lovefeast on Good Friday as they receive Holy Communion on Maundy Thursday.\n\n**Reformed Churches**\n\nIn the Reformed tradition, Good Friday is one of the evangelical feasts and is thus widely observed with church services, which feature the Solemn Reproaches in the pattern of Psalm 78, towards the end of the liturgy.\n\n**Other Christian traditions**\n\nMany Protestant churches hold an Interdenominational service with Lord's Supper.\n\n**Associated Customs**\n\nIn many countries and territories with a strong Christian tradition, such as Australia, Bermuda, Brazil, Canada, the countries of the Caribbean, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Malta, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, the Philippines, Portugal, the Scandinavian countries, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela, the day is observed as a public or federal holiday. In the United States, 12 states observe Good Friday as a state holiday: Connecticut, Texas, Delaware, Hawaii, Indiana, Tennessee, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina and North Dakota. One associated custom is strict adherence to the Black Fast, where believers fast from food and liquids during the day and after sunset, a vegetarian meal with water is consumed.\n\n**Australia**\n\nGood Friday is a holiday under state and territory laws in all states and territories in Australia. Generally speaking, shops in all Australian states (but not in the two territories of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory) are required to remain closed for the duration of Good Friday, although there are certain shops which are permitted to open and other shops can apply for exemptions. All schools and universities close on Good Friday in Australia, and Good Friday falls within the school holidays in most years in all states and territories except the Northern Territory, although many states now commence their school holidays in early April regardless of Easter.\n\n**Canada**\n\nIn Canada, Good Friday is a federal statutory holiday. In the province of Quebec \"employers can choose to give the day off either on Good Friday or Easter Monday.\"\n\n**Cuba**\n\nIn an online article posted on Catholic News Agency by Alejandro Bermúdez on 31 March 2012, Cuban President Raúl Castro, with the Communist Party and his advisers, decreed that Good Friday that year would be a holiday. This was Castro's response to a request made personally to him by Pope Benedict XVI during the latter's Apostolic Visitation to the island and León, Mexico that month. The move followed the pattern of small advances in Cuba's relations with the Vatican, mirroring Pope John Paul II's success in getting Fidel Castro to declare Christmas Day a holiday. Both Good Friday and Christmas are now annual holidays in Cuba.\n\n**Hong Kong**\n\nIn Hong Kong, Good Friday was designated a public holiday in the Holidays Ordinance, 1875. Good Friday continues to be a holiday after the transfer of sovereignty from the UK to China in 1997. Government offices, banks, post offices and most offices are closed on Good Friday.\n\n**Ireland**\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, Good Friday is not an official public holiday, but most non-retail businesses close for the day. Up until 2018 it was illegal to sell alcoholic beverages on Good Friday, with some exceptions, so pubs and off-licences generally closed. Critics of the ban included the catering and tourism sector, but surveys showed that the general public were divided on the issue.\n\n**Malaysia**\n\nAlthough Malaysia is a Muslim-majority country, Good Friday is declared as a public holiday in the states of Sabah and Sarawak in East Malaysia as there is a significant Christian indigenous population in both states.\n\n**Malta**\n\nThe Holy Week commemorations reach their peak on Good Friday as the Roman Catholic Church celebrates the passion of Jesus. Solemn celebrations take place in all churches together with processions in different villages around Malta and Gozo. During the celebration, the narrative of the passion is read in some localities, while the Adoration of the Cross follows. Good Friday processions take place in Birgu, Bormla, Għaxaq, Luqa, Mosta, Naxxar, Paola, Qormi, Rabat, Senglea, Valletta, Żebbuġ (Città Rohan) and Żejtun. Processions in Gozo will be in Nadur, Victoria (St George and Cathedral), Xagħra and Żebbuġ, Gozo.\n\n**New Zealand**\n\nIn New Zealand, Good Friday is a legal holiday and is a day of mandatory school closure for all New Zealand state and integrated schools. Good Friday is also a restricted trading day in New Zealand, which means that unexempted shops are not permitted to open on this day.\n\n**Philippines**\n\nIn the predominantly Roman Catholic Philippines, the day is commemorated with street processions, the Way of the Cross, the chanting of the Pasyón, and performances of the Senákulo or Passion play. Some devotees engage in self-flagellation and even have themselves crucified as expressions of penance despite health risks and strong disapproval from the Church.\n\n**Poland**\n\nIn Polish churches, a tableau of Christ's Tomb is unveiled in the sanctuary. Many of the faithful spend long hours into the night grieving at the Tomb, where it is customary to kiss the wounds on the Lord's body. A life-size figure of Jesus lying in his tomb is widely visited by the faithful, especially on Holy Saturday. The tableaux may include flowers, candles, figures of angels standing watch, and the three crosses atop Mt Calvary, and much more. Each parish strives to come up with the most artistically and religiously evocative arrangement in which the Blessed Sacrament, draped in a filmy veil, is prominently displayed.\n\n**Singapore**\n\nGood Friday is a public holiday in Singapore.\n\n**Spain**\n\nIn Spain, Good Friday is a national holiday. The tradition of the \"Vía Crucis\" (Way of the Cross) is an important part of the celebrations.\n\n**United Kingdom**\n\nIn the UK, Good Friday was historically a common law holiday and is recognised as an official public holiday (also known as a Bank Holiday). All state schools are closed and most businesses treat it as a holiday for staff; however, many retail stores now remain open. Government services in Northern Ireland operate as normal on Good Friday, substituting Easter Tuesday for the holiday.\n\n**United States**\n\nIn the United States, Good Friday is not a government holiday at the federal level, because it is a secular country. The postal service operates, and banks regulated by the federal government do not close for Good Friday.\n\n**Calculating the Date**\n\nGood Friday is the Friday before Easter, which is calculated differently in Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity (see Computus for details). Easter falls on the first Sunday following the Paschal Full Moon, the full moon on or after 21 March, taken to be the date of the vernal equinox. The Western calculation uses the Gregorian calendar, while the Eastern calculation uses the Julian calendar, whose 21 March now corresponds to the Gregorian calendar's 3 April. The calculations for identifying the date of the full moon also differ.\n\n**Cultural References**\n\nGood Friday assumes a particular importance in the plot of Richard Wagner's music drama Parsifal, which contains an orchestral interlude known as the \"Good Friday Music\".\n\n**Memoration on Wednesday of the Holy Week**\n\nSome Baptist congregations, the Philadelphia Church of God, and some non-denominational churches oppose the observance of Good Friday, regarding it as a so-called \"papist\" tradition, and instead observe the Crucifixion of Jesus on Wednesday to coincide with the Jewish sacrifice of the Passover Lamb (which some/many Christians believe is an Old Testament pointer to Jesus Christ). A Wednesday Crucifixion of Jesus allows for him to be in the tomb (\"heart of the earth\") for three days and three nights as he told the Pharisees he would be (Matthew 12:40), rather than two nights and a day (by inclusive counting, as was the norm at that time) if he had died on a Friday.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Good_Friday\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe term Good Friday comes from the sense 'pious, holy' of the word good [11] Less common examples of expressions based on this obsolete sense of good include 'the good book\" for the Bible, 'good tide' for Christmas or Shrovetide, and Good Wednesday for the Wednesday in Holy Week [12] A common folk etymology incorrectly analyzes Good Friday as a corruption of God Friday, similar to the linguistically correct description of goodbye as a contraction of 'God be with ye' [13] In Old English, the day was called Long Friday (langa frigedæg  [ˈlɑŋɡɑ ˈfriːjedæj]), [clarification needed] and equivalents of this term are still used in Scandinavian languages and Finnish [14]\n\n\nBiblical accounts\nAccording to the accounts in the Gospels, the royal soldiers, guided by Jesus' disciple Judas Iscariot, arrested Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane Judas received money (30 pieces of silver)  [15] for betraying Jesus and told the guards that whomever he kisses is the one they are to arrest Following his arrest, Jesus was taken to the house of Annas, the father-in-law of the high priest, Caiaphas There he was interrogated with little result and sent bound to Caiaphas the high priest where the Sanhedrin had assembled [16]\n\n\nEastern Orthodox\nByzantine Christians (Eastern Christians who follow the Rite of Constantinople: Orthodox Christians and Greek-Catholics) call this day \"Great and Holy Friday\", or simply \"Great Friday\" [38] Because the sacrifice of Jesus through his crucifixion is recalled on this day, the Divine Liturgy (the sacrifice of bread and wine) is never celebrated on Great Friday, except when this day coincides with the Great Feast of the Annunciation, which falls on the fixed date of 25 March (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar, 25 March currently falls on 7 April of the modern Gregorian Calendar) Also on Great Friday, the clergy no longer wear the purple or red that is customary throughout Great Lent, [39] but instead don black vestments There is no \"stripping of the altar\" on Holy and Great Thursday as in the West; instead, all of the church hangings are changed to black, and will remain so until the Divine Liturgy on Great Saturday [40] [41]\n\n\nMatins of Holy and Great Friday\nThe Byzantine Christian observance of Holy and Great Friday, which is formally known as The Order of Holy and Saving Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, begins on Thursday night with the Matins of the Twelve Passion Gospels Scattered throughout this Matins service are twelve readings from all four of the Gospels which recount the events of the Passion from the Last Supper through the Crucifixion and burial of Jesus Some churches have a candelabrum with twelve candles on it, and after each Gospel reading one of the candles is extinguished [43]\n\n\nRoyal Hours\nThe next day, in the forenoon on Friday, all gather again to pray the Royal Hours, [47] a special expanded celebration of the Little Hours (including the First Hour, Third Hour, Sixth Hour, Ninth Hour and Typica) with the addition of scripture readings (Old Testament, Epistle and Gospel) and hymns about the Crucifixion at each of the Hours (some of the material from the previous night is repeated) This is somewhat more festive in character, and derives its name of \"Royal\" from both the fact that the Hours are served with more solemnity than normal, commemorating Christ the King who humbled himself for the salvation of mankind, and also from the fact that this service was in the past attended by the Emperor and his court [48]\n\n\nVespers of Holy and Great Friday\nIn the afternoon, around 3 pm, all gather for the Vespers of the Taking-Down from the Cross, [49] commemorating the Deposition from the Cross Following Psalm 103 (104) and the Great Litany, 'Lord, I call' is sung without a Psalter reading The first five stichera (the first being repeated) are taken from the Aposticha at Matins the night before, but the final 3 of the 5 are sung in Tone 2 Three more stichera in Tone 6 lead to the Entrance The Evening Prokimenon is taken from Psalm 21 (22): 'They parted My garments among them, and cast lots upon My vesture.'\n\n\nMatins of Holy and Great Saturday\nOn Friday night, the Matins of Holy and Great Saturday, a unique service known as The Lamentation at the Tomb [52] (Epitáphios Thrēnos) is celebrated This service is also sometimes called Jerusalem Matins Much of the service takes place around the tomb of Christ in the center of the nave [53]\n\n\nRoman Catholic\nIn Latin, the name used by the Catholic Church until 1955 was Feria sexta in Parasceve (\"Friday of Preparation  [for the Sabbath]\") In the 1955 reform of Holy Week, it was renamed Feria sexta in Passione et Morte Domini (\"Friday of the Passion and Death of the Lord\"), and in the new rite introduced in 1970, shortened to Feria sexta in Passione Domini (\"Friday of the Passion of the Lord\") [57]\n\n\nDay of Fasting\nThe Catholic Church regards Good Friday and Holy Saturday as the Paschal fast, in accordance with Article 110 of Sacrosanctum Concilium [58] In the Latin Church, a fast day is understood as having only one full meal and two collations (a smaller repast, the two of which together do not equal the one full meal) [59] [60] – although this may be observed less stringently on Holy Saturday than on Good Friday [58]\n\n\nServices on the day\nThe Roman Rite has no celebration of Mass between the Mass of the Lord's Supper on Holy Thursday (Maundy Thursday) evening and the Easter Vigil unless a special exemption is granted for rare solemn or grave occasions by the Vatican or the local bishop The only sacraments celebrated during this time are Baptism (for those in danger of death), Penance, and Anointing of the Sick [61] While there is no celebration of the Eucharist, it is distributed to the faithful only in the Celebration of the Passion of the Lord, but can also be taken at any hour to the sick who are unable to attend this celebration [62]\n\n\nThree Hours' Agony\nThe Three Hours' Devotion based on the Seven Last Words from the Cross begins at noon and ends at 3 pm, the time that the Christian tradition teaches that Jesus died on the cross [72]\n\n\nLiturgy\nThe Good Friday liturgy consists of three parts: the Liturgy of the Word, the Veneration of the Cross, and the Holy Communion.\n\n\nStations of the Cross\nIn addition to the prescribed liturgical service, the Stations of the Cross are often prayed either in the church or outside, and a prayer service may be held from midday to 3.00 pm, known as the Three Hours' Agony [81] In countries such as Malta, Italy, the Philippines, Puerto Rico and Spain, processions with statues representing the Passion of Christ are held [82] [83] [84] [85] [86]\n\n\nPlenary indulgence\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, plenary indulgence is obtained if the faithful venerates the cross with piety in the solemn Celebration of the Passion of the Lord on Good Friday [88]\n\n\nNovena to the Divine Mercy\nThe novena to the Divine Mercy begins on that day and lasts until the Saturday before Divine Mercy Sunday Both days are linked in terms of content, as the mercy of God flows from the Sacred Heart of Jesus that was pierced on the cross [89] [90]\n\n\nProtestant\nIn Lutheran tradition from the 16th to the 20th century, Good Friday was the most important religious holiday, and abstention from all worldly works was expected During that time, Lutheranism had no restrictions on the celebration of the Eucharist on Good Friday; on the contrary, it was a prime day on which to receive the Eucharist, and services were often accentuated by special music such as the St Matthew Passion by Johann Sebastian Bach

majority of businesses are closed on Good Friday, although many recreational businesses, such as the Sydney Royal Easter Show, open on Good Friday as among non-religious families Good Friday is a popular day to indulge in such activities.\n\n\nCanada\nIn Canada, Good Friday is a federal statutory holiday In the province of Quebec \"employers can choose to give the day off either on Good Friday

He has been at the helm of the program since 2018 and has led the team to several notable victories, including the 2023 NCAA championship.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n\nDan Hurley was born on January 16, 1973, in Jersey City, New Jersey. He was raised with his siblings Bobby and Melissa by his parents, Hall of Fame high school coach Bob Hurley Sr. and Christine Hurley. Bobby is a former college basketball player and current head coach at Arizona State University.\n\nHurley's family has a rich basketball tradition, and his father, Bob Hurley, is widely regarded as one of the greatest high school coaches in American basketball history. The elder Hurley coached St. Anthony High School in Jersey City to 28 state championships and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2014.\n\nHurley's early years were spent watching his father coach and learning the intricacies of the game. He credits his father with teaching him the importance of hard work, discipline, and teamwork. These values have stayed with Hurley throughout his coaching career and have been reflected in his teams' performances.\n\nCareer\n\nHurley's coaching career began at St. Benedict's Preparatory School in Newark, New Jersey, where he served as the head coach from 2001 to 2010. During his tenure, he built the school into one of the top high school basketball programs in America. Hurley's teams won three state championships and produced several college-ready players.\n\nIn 2010, Hurley left St. Benedict's to become the head coach at the University of Rhode Island. He spent four seasons at the helm of the Rams, leading the team to two NCAA tournament appearances and a 78-62 overall record.\n\nOn March 22, 2018, Hurley was named the head coach at the University of Connecticut. The Huskies had struggled in recent years, failing to make the NCAA tournament in consecutive seasons. Hurley's appointment was seen as a bold move by the university, and he was tasked with restoring the program to its former glory.\n\nUnder Hurley's leadership, the Huskies have shown significant improvement. In 2021, he guided the team back to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2016. The Huskies lost in the first round but returned in 2022, only to lose again in the first round. However, in 2023, Hurley led the Huskies to their first NCAA championship in over two decades.\n\nThe 2023 championship run was a remarkable one, with the Huskies overcoming several key injuries and adversity to claim the title. Hurley's team was led by a talented group of players, including Adama Sanogo, who was named the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nHurley married his wife, Andrea Sirakides, in 1997. The couple met while they were both students at Seton Hall University. They have two sons, Danny and Andrew, both of whom have been involved in basketball. Danny, the older of the two, graduated from Seton Hall in 2021 and has worked as a coach's assistant for several teams. Andrew, the younger son, attends the University of Connecticut and has played on his father's teams.\n\nHead Coaching Record\n\n| Team | Year | Wins | Losses | Pct. | Notes |\n| St. Benedict's Preparatory School | 2001-2002 | 22-7 | .759 |  |\n| St. Benedict's Preparatory School | 2002-2003 | 25-5 | .833 |  |\n| St. Benedict's Preparatory School | 2003-2004 | 28-4 | .875 |  |\n| St. Benedict's Preparatory School | 2004-2005 | 29-2 | .935 |  |\n|  St. Benedict's Preparatory School | 2005-2006 | 29-2 | .935 |  |\n| St. Benedict's Preparatory School | 2006-2007 | 27-5 | .844 |  |\n| St. Benedict's Preparatory School | 2007-2008 | 25-5 | .833 |  |\n| St. Benedict's Preparatory School | 2008-2009 | 28-4 | .875 |  |\n| St. Benedict's Preparatory School | 2009-2010 | 29-2 | .935 |  |\n| University of Rhode Island | 2010-2011 | 23-11 | .677 |  |\n| University of Rhode Island | 2011-2012 | 18-17 | .514 |  |\n| University of Rhode Island | 2012-2013 | 14-18 | .438 |  |\n| University of Rhode Island | 2013-2014 | 14-18 | .438 |  |\n| University of Connecticut | 2018-2019 | 5-27 | .156 |  |\n| University of Connecticut | 2019-2020 | 19-13 | .594 |  |\n| University of Connecticut | 2020-2021 | 11-13 | .458 |  |\n| University of Connecticut | 2021-2022 | 23-10 | .697 |  |\n| University of Connecticut | 2022-2023 | 30-7 | .811 |  |\n\nExternal Links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Dan_Hurley\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nHurley was born to Hall of Fame high school coach Bob Hurley Sr and Christine Hurley on January 16, 1973, in Jersey City, New Jersey, where he was raised with his siblings Bobby and Melissa [4] [5] Bobby is a former Duke and Sacramento Kings guard and the current head coach at Arizona State University [5]\n\n\nCareer\nHurley was head coach of Saint Benedict's Preparatory School (2001–2010), where he is credited with building the New Jersey school into one of the top high school basketball programs in America [9]\n\n\nUniversity of Connecticut\nHe was named head coach of UConn on March 22, 2018 In 2021, he returned the Huskies to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2016, then again in 2022, losing in the first round both times He won the NCAA championship with the Huskies in 2023 [13] In June 2023, he agreed to a six-year contract extension with UConn worth $32.1M [14] In July 2024, he signed an extension worth $50M over six years [15]\n\n\nPersonal life\nHurley married Andrea Sirakides in 1997 They met while they were both students at Seton Hall They have two sons: Danny (born July, 1999) and Andrew (born January 30, 2002) Danny graduated from Seton Hall in 2021 Andrew attends the University of Connecticut, where he was on his father's 2023 and 2024 NCAA championship teams [24] [25]\n\n\nHead coaching record\n      National champion  \n      Postseason invitational champion  \n\n      Conference regular season champion   \n      Conference regular season and conference tournament champion\n\n      Division regular season champion\n      Division regular season and conference tournament champion\n\n      Conference tournament champion\n\n\nReferences\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nExternal links\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

the Tanasi River, now known as the Little Tennessee River This town appeared on British maps as early as 1725 In 1567, Spanish explorer Captain Juan Pardo and his party encountered a Native American village named \"Tanasqui\" in the area while traveling inland from modern-day South Carolina; however, it is unknown if this was the same settlement as Tanasi [b] Recent research suggests that the

years ago at the end of the Last Glacial Period Archaeological excavations indicate that the lower Tennessee Valley was heavily populated by Ice Age hunter-gatherers, and Middle Tennessee is believed to have been rich with game animals such as mastodons [23] The names of the cultural groups who inhabited the area before European contact are unknown, but archaeologists have named several distinct cultural phases, including the Archaic (8000–1000 BC), Woodland (1000 BC–1000 AD), and Mississippian (1000–1600 AD) periods [24] The Archaic peoples first domesticated dogs, and plants such as squash, corn, gourds, and sunflowers were first grown in Tennessee during the Woodland period [25] Later generations of Woodland peoples constructed the first mounds Rapid civilizational development occurred during the Mississippian period, when Indigenous peoples developed organized chiefdoms and constructed numerous ceremonial structures throughout the state [26]\n\n\nPre-European era\nThe first inhabitants of Tennessee were Paleo-Indians who arrived about 12,000 years ago at the end of the Last Glacial Period Archaeological excavations indicate that the lower Tennessee Valley was heavily populated by Ice Age hunter-gatherers, and Middle Tennessee is believed to have been rich with game animals such as mastodons [23] The names of the cultural groups who inhabited the area before European contact are unknown, but archaeologists have named several distinct cultural phases, including the Archaic (8000–1000 BC), Woodland (1000 BC–1000 AD), and Mississippian (1000–1600 AD) periods [24] The Archaic peoples first domesticated dogs, and plants such as squash, corn, gourds, and sunflowers were first grown in Tennessee during the Woodland period [25] Later generations of Woodland peoples constructed the first mounds Rapid civilizational development occurred during the Mississippian period, when Indigenous peoples developed organized chiefdoms and constructed numerous ceremonial structures throughout the state [26]\n\n\nExploration and colonization\nThe first recorded European expeditions into what is now Tennessee were led by Spanish explorers Hernando de Soto in 1540–1541, Tristan de Luna in 1559, and Juan Pardo in 1566–1567 [34] [35] [36] In 1673, English fur trader Abraham Wood sent an expedition from the Colony of Virginia into Overhill Cherokee territory in modern-day northeastern Tennessee [37] [38] That same year, a French expedition led by missionary Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet explored the Mississippi River and became the first Europeans to map the Mississippi Valley [38] [37] In 1682, an expedition led by René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle constructed Fort Prudhomme on the Chickasaw Bluffs in West Tennessee [39] By the late 17th century, French traders began to explore the Cumberland River valley, and in 1714, under Charles Charleville's command, established French Lick, a fur trading settlement at the present location of Nashville near the Cumberland River [40] [41] In 1739, the French constructed Fort Assumption under Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville on the Mississippi River at the present location of Memphis, which they used as a base against the Chickasaw during the 1739 Campaign of the Chickasaw Wars [42]\n\n\nStatehood and antebellum era\nAs support for statehood grew among the settlers, Governor Blount called for elections, which were held in December 1793 [70] The 13-member territorial House of Representatives first convened in Knoxville on February 24, 1794, to select ten members for the legislature's upper house, the council [70] The full legislature convened on August 25, 1794 [71] In June 1795, the legislature conducted a census of the territory, which recorded a population of 77,263, including 10,613 slaves, and a poll that showed 6,504 in favor of statehood and 2,562 opposed [72] [73] Elections for a constitutional convention were held in December 1795, and the delegates convened in Knoxville on January 17, 1796, to begin drafting a state constitution [74] During this convention, the name Tennessee was chosen for the new state [22] The constitution was completed on February 6, which authorized elections for the state's new legislature, the Tennessee General Assembly [75] [76] The legislature convened on March 28, 1796, and the next day, John Sevier was announced as the state's first governor [75] [76] Tennessee was admitted to the Union on June 1, 1796, as the 16th state and the first created from federal territory [77] [78]\n\n\nCivil War\nAt the onset of the American Civil War, most Middle and West Tennesseans favored efforts to preserve their slavery-based economies, but many Middle Tennesseans were initially skeptical of secession In East Tennessee, most people favored remaining in the Union [93] In 1860, slaves composed about 25% of Tennessee's population, the lowest share among the states that joined the Confederacy [94] Tennessee provided more Union troops than any other Confederate state, and the second-highest number of Confederate troops, behind Virginia [16] [95] Due to its central location, Tennessee was a crucial state during the war and saw more military engagements than any state except Virginia [96]\n\n\nReconstruction and late 19th century\nThe years after the Civil War were characterized by tension and unrest between blacks and former Confederates, the worst of which occurred in Memphis in 1866 [120] Because Tennessee had ratified the Fourteenth Amendment before its readmission to the Union, it was the only former secessionist state that did not have a military governor during Reconstruction [118] The Radical Republicans seized control of the state government toward the end of the war, and appointed William G \"Parson\" Brownlow governor Under Brownlow's administration from 1865 to 1869, the legislature allowed African American men to vote, disenfranchised former Confederates, and with martial law, took action against the Ku Klux Klan, which was founded in December 1865 in Pulaski as a vigilante group to advance former Confederates' interests [121] In 1870, Southern Democrats regained control of the state legislature, [122] and over the next two decades, passed Jim Crow laws to enforce racial segregation [123] A total of 251 lynchings, predominately of Black people, took place in Tennessee [124] [125]\n\n\nEarly 20th century\nDue to increasing racial segregation and poor standards of living, many black Tennesseans fled to industrial cities in the Northeast and Midwest as part of the first wave of the Great Migration between 1915 and 1930 [138] Many residents of rural parts of Tennessee relocated to larger cities during this time for more lucrative employment opportunities [129] As part of the Temperance movement, Tennessee became the first state in the nation to effectively ban the sale, transportation, and production of alcohol in a series of laws passed between 1907 and 1917 [139] During Prohibition, illicit production of moonshine became extremely common in East Tennessee, particularly in the mountains, and continued for many decades afterward [140]\n\n\nMid-20th century to present\nAfter the U.S Supreme Court ruled racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional in Brown v Board of Education in 1954, Oak Ridge High School in 1955 became the first school in Tennessee to be integrated [157] The next year, nearby Clinton High School was integrated, and Tennessee National Guard troops were sent in after pro-segregationists threatened violence [157] Between February and May 1960, a series of sit-ins at segregated lunch counters in Nashville organized by the Nashville Student Movement resulted in the desegregation of facilities in the city [158] On April 4, 1968, James Earl Ray assassinated civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr in Memphis [159] King had traveled there to support striking African American sanitation workers [160] [161]\n\n\nGeography\nTennessee is in the Southeastern United States Culturally, most of the state is considered part of the Upland South, and the eastern third is part of Appalachia [178] Tennessee covers roughly 42,143 square miles (109,150 km2), of which 926 square miles (2,400 km2), or 2.2%, is water It is the 16th smallest state in land area The state is about 440 miles (710 km) long from east to west and 112 miles (180 km) wide from north to south Tennessee is geographically, culturally, economically, and legally divided into three Grand Divisions: East Tennessee, Middle Tennessee, and West Tennessee [179] It borders eight other states: Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi on the south, and Arkansas and Missouri on the west It is tied with Missouri as the state bordering the most other states [180] Tennessee is trisected by the Tennessee River, and its geographical center is in Murfreesboro Nearly three–fourths of the state is in the Central Time Zone, with most of East Tennessee on Eastern Time [181] The Tennessee River forms most of the division between Middle and West Tennessee [179]\n\n\nTopography\nThe southwestern Blue Ridge Mountains lie within Tennessee's eastern edge, and are divided into several subranges, namely the Great Smoky Mountains, Bald Mountains, Unicoi Mountains, Unaka Mountains, and Iron Mountains These mountains, which average 5,000 feet (1,500 m) above sea level in Tennessee, contain some of the highest elevations in eastern North America The state's border with North Carolina roughly follows the highest peaks of this range, including Kuwohi Most of the Blue Ridge area is protected by the Cherokee National Forest, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and several federal wilderness areas and state parks [198] The Appalachian Trail roughly follows the North Carolina state line before shifting westward into Tennessee [199]\n\n\nHydrology\nTennessee is drained by three major rivers, the Tennessee, Cumberland, and Mississippi The Tennessee River begins at the juncture of the Holston and French Broad rivers in Knoxville, flows southwest to Chattanooga, and exits into Alabama before reemerging in the western part of the state and flowing north into Kentucky [218] Its major tributaries include the Clinch, Little Tennessee, Hiwassee, Sequatchie, Elk, Beech, Buffalo, Duck, and Big Sandy rivers [218] The Cumberland River flows through the north-central part of the state, emerging in the northeastern Highland Rim, passing through Nashville, turning northwest to Clarksville, and entering Kentucky east of the Tennessee River [219] Its principal branches in Tennessee are the Obey, Caney Fork, Stones, Harpeth, and Red rivers [219] The Mississippi River drains nearly all of West Tennessee [220] Its tributaries are the Obion, Forked Deer, Hatchie, Loosahatchie, and Wolf rivers [220] The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the U.S Army Corps of Engineers operate many hydroelectric dams on the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers and their tributaries, which form large reservoirs throughout the state [221]\n\n\nEcology\nTennessee is within a temperate deciduous forest biome commonly known as the Eastern Deciduous Forest [224] It has eight ecoregions: the Blue Ridge, Ridge and Valley, Central Appalachian, Southwestern Appalachian, Interior Low Plateaus, Southeastern Plains, Mississippi Valley Loess Plains, and Mississippi Alluvial Plain regions [225] Tennessee is the most biodiverse inland state, [226] the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most biodiverse national park, [227] [228] and the Duck River is the most biologically diverse waterway in North America [229] The Nashville Basin is renowned for its diversity of flora and fauna [230] Tennessee is home to 340 species of birds, 325 freshwater fish species, 89 mammals, 77 amphibians, and 61 reptiles [227]\n\n\nClimate\nMost of Tennessee has a humid subtropical climate, with the exception of some of the higher elevations in the Appalachians, which are classified as a cooler mountain temperate or humid continental climate [238] The Gulf of Mexico is the dominant factor in Tennessee's climate, with winds from the south responsible for most of the state's annual precipitation Generally, the state has hot summers and mild to cool winters with generous precipitation throughout the year The highest average monthly precipitation usually occurs between December and April The driest months, on average, are August to October The state receives an average of 50 inches (130 cm) of precipitation annually Snowfall ranges from 5 inches (13 cm) in West Tennessee to over 80 inches (200 cm) in East Tennessee's highest mountains [239] [240]\n\n\nCities, towns,

in the decades after the Civil War, when many factories, including iron foundries, steel mills, and textile mills were constructed there [129] But most of Tennessee's industrial growth began with the federal investments in the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the Manhattan Project in the 1930s and 1940s The state's industrial and manufacturing sector continued to expand in the succeeding decades, and Tennessee is now home to more than 2,400 advanced manufacturing establishments, which produce a total of more than $29 billion worth of goods annually [307]\n\n\nBusiness\nTennessee's

"**Tennessee**\n\nTennessee is a state located in the southeastern United States. It is bordered by Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi on the south, and Arkansas and Missouri on the west. The state's capital is Nashville, and its largest city is Memphis.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name Tennessee is derived from the Cherokee town of Tanasi, which was located in present-day Monroe County. The town was named after the Tanasi River, which flows through the area. The name was later adapted from the Yuchi word Tana-tsee-dgee, meaning \"brother-waters-place\" or \"where-the-waters-meet\".\n\n**History**\n\nThe first inhabitants of Tennessee were Paleo-Indians who arrived about 12,000 years ago at the end of the Last Glacial Period. Archaeological excavations indicate that the lower Tennessee Valley was heavily populated by Ice Age hunter-gatherers, and Middle Tennessee is believed to have been rich with game animals such as mastodons. The names of the cultural groups who inhabited the area before European contact are unknown, but archaeologists have named several distinct cultural phases, including the Archaic, Woodland, and Mississippian periods.\n\n**Pre-European Era**\n\nThe Archaic peoples first domesticated dogs, and plants such as squash, corn, gourds, and sunflowers were first grown in Tennessee during the Woodland period. Later generations of Woodland peoples constructed the first mounds. Rapid civilizational development occurred during the Mississippian period, when Indigenous peoples developed organized chiefdoms and constructed numerous ceremonial structures throughout the state.\n\n**Exploration and Colonization**\n\nThe first recorded European expeditions into what is now Tennessee were led by Spanish explorers Hernando de Soto in 1540-1541, Tristan de Luna in 1559, and Juan Pardo in 1566-1567. In 1673, English fur trader Abraham Wood sent an expedition from the Colony of Virginia into Overhill Cherokee territory in modern-day northeastern Tennessee. That same year, a French expedition led by missionary Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet explored the Mississippi River and became the first Europeans to map the Mississippi Valley.\n\n**Statehood and Antebellum Era**\n\nAs support for statehood grew among the settlers, Governor Blount called for elections, which were held in December 1793. The 13-member territorial House of Representatives first convened in Knoxville on February 24, 1794, to select ten members for the legislature's upper house, the council. The full legislature convened on August 25, 1794. In June 1795, the legislature conducted a census of the territory, which recorded a population of 77,263, including 10,613 slaves, and a poll that showed 6,504 in favor of statehood and 2,562 opposed. Elections for a constitutional convention were held in December 1795, and the delegates convened in Knoxville on January 17, 1796, to begin drafting a state constitution. During this convention, the name Tennessee was chosen for the new state. The constitution was completed on February 6, which authorized elections for the state's new legislature, the Tennessee General Assembly. The legislature convened on March 28, 1796, and the next day, John Sevier was announced as the state's first governor. Tennessee was admitted to the Union on June 1, 1796, as the 16th state and the first created from federal territory.\n\n**Civil War**\n\nAt the onset of the American Civil War, most Middle and West Tennesseans favored efforts to preserve their slavery-based economies, but many Middle Tennesseans were initially skeptical of secession. In East Tennessee, most people favored remaining in the Union. Tennessee provided more Union troops than any other Confederate state, and the second-highest number of Confederate troops, behind Virginia. Due to its central location, Tennessee was a crucial state during the war and saw more military engagements than any state except Virginia.\n\n**Reconstruction and Late 19th Century**\n\nThe years after the Civil War were characterized by tension and unrest between blacks and former Confederates, the worst of which occurred in Memphis in 1866. Because Tennessee had ratified the Fourteenth Amendment before its readmission to the Union, it was the only former secessionist state that did not have a military governor during Reconstruction. The Radical Republicans seized control of the state government toward the end of the war, and appointed William G. \"Parson\" Brownlow governor. Under Brownlow's administration from 1865 to 1869, the legislature allowed African American men to vote, disenfranchised former Confederates, and with martial law, took action against the Ku Klux Klan, which was founded in December 1865 in Pulaski as a vigilante group to advance former Confederates' interests.\n\n**Early 20th Century**\n\nDue to increasing racial segregation and poor standards of living, many black Tennesseans fled to industrial cities in the Northeast and Midwest as part of the first wave of the Great Migration between 1915 and 1930. Many residents of rural parts of Tennessee relocated to larger cities during this time for more lucrative employment opportunities. As part of the Temperance movement, Tennessee became the first state in the nation to effectively ban the sale, transportation, and production of alcohol in a series of laws passed between 1907 and 1917. During Prohibition, illicit production of moonshine became extremely common in East Tennessee, particularly in the mountains, and continued for many decades afterward.\n\n**Mid-20th Century to Present**\n\nAfter the U.S. Supreme Court ruled racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, Oak Ridge High School in 1955 became the first school in Tennessee to be integrated. The next year, nearby Clinton High School was integrated, and Tennessee National Guard troops were sent in after pro-segregationists threatened violence. Between February and May 1960, a series of sit-ins at segregated lunch counters in Nashville organized by the Nashville Student Movement resulted in the desegregation of facilities in the city. On April 4, 1968, James Earl Ray assassinated civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis. King had traveled there to support striking African American sanitation workers.\n\n**Geography**\n\nTennessee is in the Southeastern United States. Culturally, most of the state is considered part of the Upland South, and the eastern third is part of Appalachia. Tennessee covers roughly 42,143 square miles (109,150 km2), of which 926 square miles (2,400 km2), or 2.2%, is water. It is the 16th smallest state in land area. The state is about 440 miles (710 km) long from east to west and 112 miles (180 km) wide from north to south. Tennessee is geographically, culturally, economically, and legally divided into three Grand Divisions: East Tennessee, Middle Tennessee, and West Tennessee. It borders eight other states: Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi on the south, and Arkansas and Missouri on the west.\n\n**Topography**\n\nThe southwestern Blue Ridge Mountains lie within Tennessee's eastern edge, and are divided into several subranges, namely the Great Smoky Mountains, Bald Mountains, Unicoi Mountains, Unaka Mountains, and Iron Mountains. These mountains, which average 5,000 feet (1,500 m) above sea level in Tennessee, contain some of the highest elevations in eastern North America. The state's border with North Carolina roughly follows the highest peaks of this range, including Kuwohi. Most of the Blue Ridge area is protected by the Cherokee National Forest, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and several federal wilderness areas and state parks.\n\n**Hydrology**\n\nTennessee is drained by three major rivers, the Tennessee, Cumberland, and Mississippi. The Tennessee River begins at the juncture of the Holston and French Broad rivers in Knoxville, flows southwest to Chattanooga, and exits into Alabama before reemerging in the western part of the state and flowing north into Kentucky. Its major tributaries include the Clinch, Little Tennessee, Hiwassee, Sequatchie, Elk, Beech, Buffalo, Duck, and Big Sandy rivers. The Cumberland River flows through the north-central part of the state, emerging in the northeastern Highland Rim, passing through Nashville, turning northwest to Clarksville, and entering Kentucky east of the Tennessee River. Its principal branches in Tennessee are the Obey, Caney Fork, Stones, Harpeth, and Red rivers. The Mississippi River drains nearly all of West Tennessee.\n\n**Ecology**\n\nTennessee is within a temperate deciduous forest biome commonly known as the Eastern Deciduous Forest. It has eight ecoregions: the Blue Ridge, Ridge and Valley, Central Appalachian, Southwestern Appalachian, Interior Low Plateaus, Southeastern Plains, Mississippi Valley Loess Plains, and Mississippi Alluvial Plain regions. Tennessee is the most biodiverse inland state, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most biodiverse national park, and the Duck River is the most biologically diverse waterway in North America. The Nashville Basin is renowned for its diversity of flora and fauna. Tennessee is home to 340 species of birds, 325 freshwater fish species, 89 mammals, 77 amphibians, and 61 reptiles.\n\n**Climate**\n\nMost of Tennessee has a humid subtropical climate, with the exception of some of the higher elevations in the Appalachians, which are classified as a cooler mountain temperate or humid continental climate. The Gulf of Mexico is the dominant factor in Tennessee's climate, with winds from the south responsible for most of the state's annual precipitation. Generally, the state has hot summers and mild to cool winters with generous precipitation throughout the year. The highest average monthly precipitation usually occurs between December and April. The driest months, on average, are August to October. The state receives an average of 50 inches (130 cm) of precipitation annually. Snowfall ranges from 5 inches (13 cm) in West Tennessee to over 80 inches (200 cm) in East Tennessee's highest mountains.\n\n**Cities, Towns, and Counties**\n\nTennessee is divided into 95 counties, each of which has a county seat. The state has 340 municipalities in total. The Office of Management and Budget designates ten metropolitan areas in Tennessee, four of which extend into neighboring states.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nThe 2020 United States census reported Tennessee's population at 6,910,840, an increase of 564,735, or 8.90%, since the 2010 census. Between 2010 and 2019, the state received a natural increase of 143,253 (744,274 births minus 601,021 deaths), and an increase from net migration of 338,428 people into the state. Immigration from outside the U.S. resulted in a net increase of 79,086, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 259,342. Tennessee's center of population is in Murfreesboro in Rutherford County.\n\n**Ethnicity**\n\nIn 2020, 6.9% of the total population was of Hispanic or Latino origin (of any race), up from 4.6% in 2010. Between 2000 and 2010, Tennessee's Hispanic population grew by 134.2%, the third-highest rate of any state. In 2020, Non-Hispanic or Latino Whites were 70.9% of the population, compared to 57.7% of the population nationwide. In 2010, the five most common self-reported ethnic groups in the state were American (26.5%), English (8.2%), Irish (6.6%), German (5.5%), and Scotch-Irish (2.7%). Most Tennesseans who self-identify as having American ancestry are of English and Scotch-Irish ancestry. An estimated 21–24% of Tennesseans are of predominantly English ancestry.\n\n**Religion**\n\nSince colonization, Tennessee has always been predominantly Christian. About 81% of the population identifies as Christian, with Protestants making up 73% of the population. Of the Protestants in the state, Evangelical Protestants compose 52% of the population, Mainline Protestants 13%, and Historically Black Protestants 8%. Roman Catholics make up 6%, Mormons 1%, and Orthodox Christians less than 1%. Muslims and Jews each make up about 1% of the population, and adherents of other religions make up about 3% of the population. About 14% of Tennesseans are non-religious, with 11% identifying as \"Nothing in particular\", 3% as agnostics, and 1% as atheists.\n\n**Economy**\n\nAs of 2021, Tennessee had a gross state product of $418.3 billion. In 2020, the state's per capita personal income was $30,869. The median household income was $54,833. About 13.6% percent of the population was below the poverty line. In 2019, the state reported a total employment of 2,724,545 and a total number of 139,760 employer establishments. Tennessee is a right-to-work state, like most of its Southern neighbors. Unionization has historically been low and continues to decline, as in most of the U.S.\n\n**Taxation**\n\nTennessee has a reputation as a low-tax state and is usually ranked as one of the five states with the lowest tax burden on residents. Despite being low-tax, it is ranked third among U.S. states for fiscal health. It is one of nine states that do not have a general income tax; the sales tax is the primary means of funding the government. The Hall income tax was imposed on most dividends and interest at a rate of 6% but was completely phased out by 2021. The first $1,250 of individual income and $2,500 of joint income was exempt from this tax. Property taxes are the primary source of revenue for local governments.\n\n**Agriculture**\n\nTennessee has the eighth-most farms in the nation, which cover more than 40% of its land area and have an average size of about 155 acres (0.63 km2). Cash receipts for crops and livestock have an estimated annual value of $3.5 billion, and the agriculture sector has an estimated annual impact of $81 billion on the state's economy. Beef cattle is the state's largest agricultural commodity, followed by broilers and poultry. Tennessee ranks 12th in the nation for the number of cattle, with more than half of its farmland dedicated to cattle grazing.\n\n**Industry**\n\nUntil World War II, Tennessee, like most Southern states, remained predominantly agrarian. Chattanooga became one of the first industrial cities in the south in the decades after the Civil War, when many factories, including iron foundries, steel mills, and textile mills were constructed there. But most of Tennessee's industrial growth began with the federal investments in the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the Manhattan Project in the 1930s and 1940s. The state's industrial and manufacturing sector continued to expand in the succeeding decades, and Tennessee is now home to more than 2,400 advanced manufacturing establishments, which produce a total of more than $29 billion worth of goods annually.\n\n**Business**\n\nTennessee's commercial sector is dominated by a wide variety of companies, but its largest service industries include health care, transportation, music and entertainment, banking, and finance. Large corporations with headquarters in Tennessee include FedEx, AutoZone, International Paper, and First Horizon Corporation, all based in Memphis; Pilot Corporation and Regal Entertainment Group in Knoxville; Hospital Corporation of America based in Nashville; Unum in Chattanooga; Acadia Senior Living and Community Health Systems in Franklin; Eastman Chemical headquartered in Kingsport; Dollar General in Goodlettsville, and LifePoint Health, Tractor Supply Company, and Delek US in Brentwood.\n\n**Energy and Mineral Production**\n\nTennessee's electric utilities are regulated monopolies, as in many other states. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) owns over 90% of the state's generating capacity. Nuclear power is Tennessee's largest source of electricity generation, producing about 43.4% of its power in 2021. The same year, 22.4% of the power was produced from coal, 17.8% from natural gas, 15.8% from hydroelectricity, and 1.3% from other renewables. Tennessee is home to the first nuclear power reactor in the U.S. to begin operation in the 21st century, which is at the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant in Rhea County. Tennessee was also an early leader in hydroelectric power.\n\n**Tourism**\n\nTennessee is the 11th-most visited state in the nation, receiving a record of 126 million tourists in 2019. Its top tourist attraction is the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the most visited national park in the U.S. The park anchors a large tourism industry based primarily in nearby Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge, which includes Dollywood, the most visited ticketed attraction in Tennessee. Attractions related to Tennessee's musical heritage are spread throughout the state. Other top attractions include the Tennessee State Museum and Parthenon in Nashville; the National Civil Rights Museum and Graceland in Memphis; Lookout Mountain, the Chattanooga Choo-Choo Hotel, Ruby Falls, and the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga; the American Museum of Science and Energy in Oak Ridge, the Bristol Motor Speedway, Jack Daniel's Distillery in Lynchburg, and the Hiwassee and Ocoee rivers in Polk County.\n\n**Culture**\n\nTennessee blends southern Appalachian and Southern flavors, which originate from its English, Scotch-Irish, and African roots, and has evolved as it has grown. Its Grand Divisions also manifest into distinct cultural regions, with East Tennessee commonly associated with Southern Appalachia, and Middle and West Tennessee commonly associated with Upland Southern culture and sometimes even Deep Southern culture. Parts of West Tennessee, especially Memphis, are sometimes considered part of the Deep South. The Tennessee State Museum in Nashville chronicles the state's history and culture.\n\n**Music**\n\nTennessee has played a critical role in the development of many forms of American popular music, including blues, country, rock and roll, rockabilly, soul, bluegrass, Contemporary Christian, and gospel. Many consider Memphis's Beale Street the epicenter of the blues, with musicians such as W.C. Handy performing in its clubs as early as 1909. Memphis was historically home to Sun Records, where musicians such as Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, and Charlie Rich began their recording careers, and where rock and roll took shape in the 1950s. Stax Records in Memphis became one of the most important labels for soul artists in the late 1950s and 1960s, and a subgenre known as Memphis soul emerged. The 1927 Victor recording sessions in Bristol generally mark the beginning of the country music genre and the rise of the Grand Ole Opry in the 1930s helped make Nashville the center of the country music recording industry.\n\n**Education**\n\nEducation in Tennessee is administered by the Tennessee Department of Education. The state Board of Education has 11 members: one from each Congressional district, a student member, and the executive director of the Tennessee Higher Education Commission (THEC), who serves as ex-officio nonvoting member. Public primary and secondary education systems are operated by county, city, or special school districts to provide education at the local level, and operate under", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tennessee\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nTennessee derives its name most directly from the Cherokee town of Tanasi (or \"Tanase\", in syllabary: ᏔᎾᏏ) in present-day Monroe County, Tennessee, on the Tanasi River, now known as the Little Tennessee River This town appeared on British maps as early as 1725 In 1567, Spanish explorer Captain Juan Pardo and his party encountered a Native American village named \"Tanasqui\" in the area while traveling inland from modern-day South Carolina; however, it is unknown if this was the same settlement as Tanasi [b] Recent research suggests that the Cherokees adapted the name from the Yuchi word Tana-tsee-dgee, meaning \"brother-waters-place\" or \"where-the-waters-meet\" [19] [20] [21] The modern spelling, Tennessee, is attributed to Governor James Glen of South Carolina, who used this spelling in his official correspondence during the 1750s In 1788, North Carolina created \"Tennessee County\", and in 1796, a constitutional convention, organizing the new state out of the Southwest Territory, adopted \"Tennessee\" as the state's name [22]\n\n\nHistory\nThe first inhabitants of

peoples first domesticated dogs, and plants such as squash, corn, gourds, and sunflowers were first grown in Tennessee during the Woodland period [25] Later generations of Woodland peoples constructed the first mounds Rapid civilizational development occurred during the Mississippian period, when Indigenous peoples developed organized chiefdoms and constructed numerous ceremonial structures

from the Colony of Virginia into Overhill Cherokee territory in modern-day northeastern Tennessee [37] [38] That same year, a French expedition led by missionary Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet explored the Mississippi River and became the first Europeans to map the Mississippi Valley [38] [37] In 1682, an expedition led by René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle constructed Fort Prudhomme on the Chickasaw Bluffs in West Tennessee [39] By the late 17th century, French traders began to explore the Cumberland River valley, and in 1714, under Charles Charleville's command, established French Lick, a fur trading settlement at the present location of Nashville near the Cumberland River [40] [41] In 1739, the French constructed Fort Assumption under Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville on the Mississippi River at the present location of Memphis, which they used as a base against the Chickasaw during the 1739 Campaign of the Chickasaw Wars [42]\n\n\nStatehood and antebellum era\nAs

Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi on the south, and Arkansas and Missouri on the west It is tied with Missouri as the state bordering the most other states [180] Tennessee is trisected by the Tennessee River, and its geographical center is in Murfreesboro Nearly three–fourths of the state is in the Central Time Zone, with most of East Tennessee on Eastern Time [181] The Tennessee River forms most of the division between Middle and West Tennessee [179]\n\n\nTopography\nThe southwestern Blue Ridge Mountains lie within Tennessee's eastern edge, and are divided into several subranges,

agrarian Chattanooga became one of the first industrial cities in the south in the decades after the Civil War, when many factories, including iron foundries, steel mills, and textile mills were constructed there [129] But most of Tennessee's industrial growth began with the federal investments in the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the Manhattan Project in the 1930s and 1940s The state's industrial and manufacturing sector continued to expand in the succeeding decades, and Tennessee is now home to more than 2,400 advanced manufacturing establishments, which produce a total of

1909 [352] Memphis was historically home to Sun Records, where musicians such as Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, and Charlie Rich began their recording careers, and where rock and roll took shape in the 1950s [352] Stax Records in Memphis became one of the most important labels for soul artists in the late 1950s and 1960s, and a subgenre known as Memphis soul emerged [355] The 1927 Victor recording sessions in Bristol generally mark the beginning of the country music genre and the rise of the Grand Ole Opry in the 1930s helped make Nashville the center of the country music recording industry [356] [357] Nashville became known as \"Music City\", and the Grand Ole Opry remains the nation's longest-running radio show [353]\n\n\nEducation\nEducation in

{"title": "Indonesia", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe name Indonesia derives from the Greek words Indos (Ἰνδός) and nesos (νῆσος), meaning \"Indian islands\" [12] The name dates back to the 19th century, far predating the formation of independent Indonesia In 1850, George Windsor Earl, an English ethnologist, proposed the terms Indunesians—and, his preference, Malayunesians—for the inhabitants of the \"Indian Archipelago or Malay Archipelago\" [13] [14] In the same publication, one of his students, James Richardson Logan, used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago [15] [16] Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia They preferred Malay Archipelago (Dutch: Maleische Archipel); the Netherlands East Indies (Nederlandsch Oost Indië), popularly Indië; the East (de Oost); and Insulinde [17]\n\n\nHistory\nFossilised remains of Homo erectus, popularly known as the \"Java Man\", suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited two million to 500,000 years ago [19] [20] [21] Homo sapiens reached the region around 43,000 BCE [22] Austronesian peoples, who form the majority of the modern population, migrated to Southeast Asia from what is now Taiwan They arrived in the archipelago around 2,000 BCE and confined the native Melanesians to the far eastern regions as they spread east [23]\n\n\nEarly history\nFossilised remains of Homo erectus, popularly known as the \"Java Man\", suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited two million to 500,000 years ago [19] [20] [21] Homo sapiens reached the region around 43,000 BCE [22] Austronesian peoples, who form the majority of the modern population, migrated to Southeast Asia from what is now Taiwan They arrived in the archipelago around 2,000 BCE and confined the native Melanesians to the far eastern regions as they spread east [23]\n\n\nColonial era\nThe first Europeans arrived in the archipelago in 1512, when Portuguese traders, led by Francisco Serrão, sought to monopolise the sources of nutmeg, cloves, and cubeb pepper in the Maluku Islands [33] Dutch and British traders followed In 1602, the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company (Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie; VOC) and became the dominant European power for almost 200 years The VOC was dissolved in 1799 following bankruptcy, and the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalised colony [34]\n\n\nPost-World War II\nAs president, Sukarno moved Indonesia from democracy towards authoritarianism and maintained power by balancing the opposing forces of the military, political Islam, and the increasingly powerful Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) [51] Tensions between the military and the PKI culminated in an attempted coup in 1965 The army, led by Major General Suharto, countered by instigating a violent anti-communist purge that killed between 500,000 and one million people and incarcerated roughly a million more in concentration camps [52] [53] [54] [55] The PKI was blamed for the coup and effectively destroyed [56] [57] [58] Suharto capitalised on Sukarno's weakened position, and following a drawn-out power play with Sukarno, Suharto was appointed president in March 1968 His US-backed \"New Order\" administration [59] [60] [61] [62] encouraged foreign direct investment, [63] [64] [65] which was a crucial factor in the subsequent three decades of substantial economic growth.\n\n\nGeography\nIndonesia is the southernmost country in Asia The country lies between latitudes 11°S and 6°N and longitudes 95°E and 141°E A transcontinental country spanning Southeast Asia and Oceania, it is the world's largest archipelagic state, extending 5,120 kilometres (3,181 mi) from east to west and 1,760 kilometres (1,094 mi) from north to south [75] The country's Coordinating Ministry for Maritime and Investments Affairs says Indonesia has 17,504 islands (with 16,056 registered at the UN) [76] scattered over both sides of the equator, around 6,000 of which are inhabited [77] The largest are Sumatra, Java, Borneo (shared with Brunei and Malaysia), Sulawesi, and New Guinea (shared with Papua New Guinea) [78] Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on Borneo and Sebatik, Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea, East Timor on the island of Timor, and maritime borders with Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Palau, and Australia.\n\n\nClimate\nIndonesia lies along the equator, and its climate tends to be relatively even year-round [80] Indonesia has two seasons—a dry season and a wet season—with no extremes of summer or winter [81] For most parts of Indonesia, the dry season falls between May and October, while the wet season falls between November and April [81] Indonesia's climate is almost entirely tropical, dominated by the tropical rainforest climate found on every large island of Indonesia Cooler climate types exist in mountainous regions that are 1,300 to 1,500 metres (4,300 to 4,900 feet) above sea level The oceanic climate (Köppen Cfb) prevails in highland areas adjacent to rainforest climates, with uniform precipitation year-round In highland areas near the tropical monsoon and tropical savanna climates, the subtropical highland climate (Köppen Cwb) is more pronounced during dry season [82]\n\n\nGeology\nTectonically, most of Indonesia's area is highly unstable, making it a site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes [91] It lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire, where the Indo-Australian Plate and the Pacific Plate are pushed under the Eurasian Plate, where they melt at about 100 kilometres (62 miles) deep A string of volcanoes runs through Sumatra, Java, Bali and Nusa Tenggara, and then to the Banda Islands of Maluku to northeastern Sulawesi [92] Of the 400 volcanoes, around 130 are active [91] Between 1972 and 1991, there were 29 volcanic eruptions, mostly on Java [93] Volcanic ash has made agricultural conditions unpredictable in some areas [94] However, it has also resulted in fertile soils, a factor in historically sustaining the high population densities of Java and Bali [95]\n\n\nBiodiversity and conservation\nIndonesia's size, tropical climate, and archipelagic geography support one of the world's highest levels of biodiversity, and it is among the 17 megadiverse countries identified by Conservation International Its flora and fauna are a mixture of Asian and Australasian species [99] [100] The Sunda Shelf islands (Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Bali) were once linked to mainland Asia and have a wealth of Asian fauna Large species such as the Sumatran tiger, rhinoceros, orangutan, Asian elephant, and leopard were once abundant as far east as Bali, but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically Having been long separated from the continental landmasses, Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, and Maluku have developed their unique flora and fauna [101] [102] Papua was part of the Australian landmass and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia, including over 600 bird species [103]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nIndonesia is a republic with a presidential system Following the fall of the New Order in 1998, political and governmental structures have undergone sweeping reforms, with four constitutional amendments revamping the executive, legislative and judicial branches [131] Chief among them is the delegation of power and authority to various regional entities while remaining a unitary state [132] The President of Indonesia is the head of state and head of government, commander-in-chief of the Indonesian National Armed Forces (Tentara Nasional Indonesia, TNI), and the director of domestic governance, policy-making, and foreign affairs The president may serve a maximum of two consecutive five-year terms [133]\n\n\nParties and elections\nSince 1999, Indonesia has had a multi-party system In all legislative elections since the fall of the New Order, no political party has won an overall majority of seats The Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) secured the most votes in the 2024 general election, becoming their third consecutive wins since 2014 [140] Other notable parties include the Party of the Functional Groups (Golkar), the Great Indonesia Movement Party (Gerindra), the Democratic Party, and the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS).\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nIndonesia has several levels of subdivisions The first level are the provinces, which have a legislature (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah, DPRD) and an elected governor A total of 38 provinces have been established from the original eight in 1945, [143] the most recent change being the split of Southwest Papua from the province of West Papua in 2022 [144] The second level are the regencies (kabupaten) and cities (kota), led by regents (bupati) and mayors (walikota), respectively, and a legislature (DPRD Kabupaten/Kota) The third level are the districts (kecamatan, distrik in Papua, or kapanewon and kemantren in Yogyakarta), and the fourth are the villages (either desa, kelurahan, kampung, nagari in West Sumatra, or gampong in Aceh) [145]\n\n\nForeign relations\nIndonesia maintains 132 diplomatic missions abroad, including 95 embassies [151] The country adheres to what it calls a \"free and active\" foreign policy, seeking a role in regional affairs in proportion to its size and location but avoiding involvement in conflicts among other countries [152]\n\n\nMilitary\nIndonesia's Armed Forces (TNI) include the Army (TNI–AD), Navy (TNI–AL, which includes Marine Corps), and Air Force (TNI–AU) The army has about 400,000 active-duty personnel Defence spending in the national budget was 0.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018, [165] with controversial involvement of military-owned commercial interests and foundations [166] The Armed Forces were formed during the Indonesian National Revolution when it undertook guerrilla warfare along with informal militia Since then, territorial lines have formed the basis of all TNI branches' structure, aimed at maintaining domestic stability and deterring foreign threats [167] The military has possessed a strong political influence since its founding, which peaked during the New Order Political reforms in 1998 included the removal of the TNI's formal representation from the legislature Nevertheless, its political influence remains, albeit at a reduced level [168]\n\n\nEconomy\nIndonesia has a mixed economy in which the private sector and government play vital roles [181] As the only G20 member state in Southeast Asia, [182] the country has the largest economy in the region and is classified as a newly industrialised country Per a 2023 estimate, it is the world's 16th largest economy by nominal GDP and 7th in terms of GDP at PPP, estimated to be US$1.417 trillion and US$4.393 trillion, respectively Per capita GDP in PPP is US$15,835, while nominal per capita GDP is US$5,108 [7] Services are the economy's largest sector and account for 43.4% of GDP (2018), followed by industry (39.7%) and agriculture (12.8%) [183] Since 2009, it has employed more people than other sectors, accounting for 47.7% of the total labour force, followed by agriculture (30.2%) and industry (21.9%) [184]\n\n\nTourism\nTourism contributed around US$9.8 billion to GDP in 2020, and in the previous year, Indonesia received 15.4 million visitors [199] Overall, Australia, China, Singapore, Malaysia, and Japan are the top five sources of visitors to Indonesia [200] Since 2011, Wonderful Indonesia has been the country's international marketing campaign slogan to promote tourism [201]\n\n\nScience and technology\nGovernment expenditure on research and development is relatively low (0.3% of GDP in 2019), [205] and Indonesia ranked 54th (from 133 countries) on the 2024 Global Innovation Index report and performance above expectation for level of development in uppermiddle-income group [206] Historical examples of scientific and technological developments include the paddy cultivation technique terasering, which is common in Southeast Asia, and the pinisi boats by the Bugis and Makassar people [207] In the 1980s, Indonesian engineer Tjokorda Raka Sukawati invented a road construction technique named Sosrobahu that later became widely used in several countries [208] The country is also an active producer of passenger trains and freight wagons with its state-owned company, the Indonesian Railway Industry (INKA), and has exported trains abroad [209]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nIndonesia's transport system has been shaped over time by the economic resource base of an archipelago and the distribution of its 275 million people highly concentrated on Java [218] In 2016, the transport sector generated about 5.2% of GDP [219] The road transport system has a total length of 542,310 kilometres (336,980 miles) as of 2018 [update] [220] Jakarta has the most extended bus rapid transit system globally, boasting 251.2 kilometres (156.1 miles) in 13 corridors and ten cross-corridor routes [221] Rickshaws such as bajaj and becak and share taxis such as Angkot and Minibus are a regular sight in the country.\n\n\nTransport\nIndonesia's transport system has been shaped over time by the economic resource base of an archipelago and the distribution of

such as bajaj and becak and share taxis such as Angkot and Minibus are a regular sight in the country.\n\n\nEnergy\nIn 2019, Indonesia produced 4,999 terawatt-hours (17.059 quadrillion British thermal units) and consumed 2,357 terawatt-hours (8.043 quadrillion British thermal units) worth of energy [226] The country has substantial energy resources, including 22 billion barrels (3.5 billion cubic metres) of conventional oil and gas reserves (of which about 4 billion barrels are recoverable), 8 billion barrels of oil-equivalent coal-based methane (CBM) resources, and 28 billion tonnes of recoverable coal [227]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe 2020 census recorded Indonesia's population as 270.2 million, the fourth largest in the world, with a moderately high population growth rate of 1.25% [231] Java is the world's most populous island, [232] where 56% of the country's population lives [6] The population density is 141 people per square kilometre (370 people/sq mi), [6] ranking 88th in the world, although Java has a population density of 1,067 people per square kilometre (2,760 people/sq mi) In 1961, the first post-colonial census recorded a total of 97 million people [233] It is expected to grow to around 295 million by 2030 and 321 million by 2050 [234] The country currently possesses a relatively young population, with a median age of 30.2 years (2017 estimate) [77]\n\n\nEthnic groups and languages\nIndonesia is an ethnically diverse country, with around 1,300 distinct native ethnic groups [2] Most Indonesians are descended from Austronesian peoples whose languages had origins in Proto-Austronesian, which possibly originated in what is now Taiwan Another major grouping is the Melanesians, who inhabit eastern Indonesia (the Maluku Islands, Western New Guinea, and the eastern part of the Lesser Sunda Islands) [23] [239] [240] [241]\n\n\nReligion\nAlthough the government officially recognises only six religions: Islam, Protestantism, Roman Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, [254] [255] and indigenous religions for administrative purpose, [255] [256] religious freedom is guaranteed in the country's constitution [257] [135] With 244 million adherents (87.1%) in 2023, Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim-majority country, [258] [259] with Sunnis being the majority (99%) [260] The Shias and Ahmadis, respectively, constitute 1% (1–3 million) and 0.2% (200,000–400,000) of Muslims [255] [261] About 10% of Indonesians are Christians, who form the majority in several provinces in eastern Indonesia [262] Most Hindus are Balinese, [263] and most Buddhists are Chinese Indonesians [264]\n\n\nEducation\nEducation is compulsory for 12 years [292] Parents can choose between state-run, non-sectarian schools or private or semi-private religious (usually Islamic) schools, supervised by the ministries of Education and Religion, respectively [293] Private international schools that do not follow the national curriculum are also available The enrolment rate is 93% for primary education, 79% for secondary education, and 36% for tertiary education (2018) [294] The literacy rate is 96% (2018), and the government spends about 3.6% of GDP (2015) on education [294] In 2018, there were 4,670 higher educational institutions in Indonesia, with most (74%) located in Sumatra and Java [295] [296] According to the QS World University Rankings, Indonesia's top universities are the University of Indonesia, Gadjah Mada University, and the Bandung Institute of Technology [297]\n\n\nHealthcare\nGovernment expenditure on healthcare was about 3.3% of GDP in 2016 [298] As part of an attempt to achieve universal health care, the government launched the National Health Insurance (Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional, JKN) in 2014 [299] It includes coverage for a range of services from the public and also private firms that have opted to join the scheme Despite remarkable improvements in recent decades, such as rising life expectancy (from 62.3 years in 1990 to 71.7 years in 2019) [300] and declining child mortality (from 84 deaths per 1,000 births in 1990 to 23.9 deaths in 2019), [301] challenges remain, including maternal and child health, low air quality, malnutrition, a high rate of smoking, and infectious diseases [302]\n\n\nHuman rights\nIn the economic sphere, there is a gap in wealth, unemployment rate, and health between densely populated islands and economic centres (such as Sumatra and Java) and sparsely populated, disadvantaged areas (such as Maluku and Papua) [303] [304] This is created by a situation in which nearly 80% of Indonesia's population lives in the western parts of the archipelago [305] and yet grows slower than the rest of the country.\n\n\nCulture\nThe cultural history of the Indonesian archipelago spans more than two millennia Influences from the Indian subcontinent, mainland China, the Middle East, Europe, [313] [314] Melanesian, and Austronesian peoples have historically shaped the cultural, linguistic and religious makeup of the archipelago As a result, modern-day Indonesia has a multicultural, multilingual and multi-ethnic society, [1] [2] with a complex cultural mixture that differs significantly from the original indigenous cultures Indonesia currently holds thirteen items of UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage, including a wayang puppet theatre, kris, batik, [315] pencak silat, angklung, gamelan, and the three genres of traditional Balinese dance [316]\n\n\nArt and architecture\nIndonesian arts include both age-old art forms developed through centuries and recently developed contemporary art Indonesian arts have absorbed foreign influences—most notably from India, the Arab world, China, and Europe—due to contacts and interactions facilitated, and often motivated by trade [317] Painting is an established and developed art in Bali, where its people are famed for their artistry Their painting tradition started as classical Kamasan or Wayang style visual narrative, derived from visual art discovered on candi bas reliefs in eastern Java [318]\n\n\nMusic, dance and clothing\nThe music of Indonesia predates historical records Various indigenous tribes incorporate chants and songs accompanied by musical instruments in their rituals Angklung, kacapi suling, gong, gamelan, talempong, kulintang, and sasando are examples of traditional Indonesian instruments These include gambus and qasida from the Middle East, [324] keroncong from Portugal, [325] and dangdut—one of Indonesia's most popular music genres—with Hindi influence as well as Malay orchestras [326] Today, the Indonesian music industry has notable regional popularity in Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei [327] [328] due to the common culture and mutual intelligibility between Indonesian and Malay [329]\n\n\nTheatre and cinema\nWayang, the Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese shadow puppet theatre displays several legends from Hindu mythology such as the Ramayana and the Mahabharata [334] Other forms of local drama include the Javanese Ludruk and Ketoprak, the Sundanese Sandiwara, Betawi Lenong, [335] [336] and various Balinese dance dramas They incorporate humour and jest and often involve audiences in their performances [337] Some theatre traditions also include music, dancing and silat martial art, such as Randai from the Minangkabau people of West Sumatra It is usually performed for traditional ceremonies and festivals [338] [339] and based on semi-historical Minangkabau legends and love story [339] Modern performing art also developed in Indonesia with its distinct style of drama Notable theatre, dance, and drama troupes such as Teater Koma are famous as they often portray social and political satire of Indonesian society [340]\n\n\nMass media and literature\nMedia freedom increased considerably after the fall of the New Order, during which the Ministry of Information monitored and controlled domestic media and restricted foreign media [346] The television market includes several national commercial networks and provincial networks that compete with public TVRI, which held a monopoly on TV broadcasting from 1962 to 1989 By the early 21st century, the communications system had brought television signals to every village, and people can choose from up to 11 channels [347] Private radio stations carry news bulletins while foreign broadcasters supply programmes The number of printed publications has increased significantly since 1998 [347]\n\n\nCuisine\nIndonesian cuisine has many regional cuisines, often based upon indigenous culture and foreign influences such as Chinese, African, European, Middle Eastern, and Indian precedents [358] Rice is the leading staple food and is served with side dishes of meat and vegetables Spices (notably chili), coconut milk, fish, and chicken are fundamental ingredients [359]\n\n\nSports\nBadminton and football are the most popular sports in Indonesia Indonesia is among the few countries that have won the Thomas and Uber Cup, the world team championship of men's and women's badminton Along with weightlifting, it is the sport that contributes the most to Indonesia's Olympic medal tally Liga 1 is the country's premier football club league On the international stage, Indonesia was the first Asian team to participate in the FIFA World Cup in 1938 as the Dutch East Indies [362] On a regional level, Indonesia won a bronze medal at the 1958 Asian Games as well as three gold medals at the 1987, 1991, and 2023 Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games) Indonesia's first appearance at the AFC Asian Cup was in 1996 [363]\n\n\nSee also\n5°S 120°E﻿ / ﻿5°S 120°E﻿ / -5; 120\n\n\nNotes\n5°S 120°E﻿ / ﻿5°S 120°E﻿ / -5;

country, is the world's largest archipelagic state, spanning Southeast Asia and Oceania. It is situated between 11°S and 6°N latitude, and 95°E and 141°E longitude. The country's vast territory comprises 17,504 islands, with 6,000 of them inhabited.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"Indonesia\" is derived from the Greek words \"Indos\" (Ἰνδός) and \"nesos\" (νῆσος), meaning \"Indian islands\". The name dates back to the 19th century, predating the formation of independent Indonesia. In 1850, George Windsor Earl proposed the terms \"Indunesians\" and \"Malayunesians\" for the inhabitants of the \"Indian Archipelago or Malay Archipelago\". One of his students, James Richardson Logan, used \"Indonesia\" as a synonym for \"Indian Archipelago\".\n\n**History**\n\nFossilised remains of Homo erectus, popularly known as the \"Java Man\", suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited two million to 500,000 years ago. Homo sapiens reached the region around 43,000 BCE. Austronesian peoples, who form the majority of the modern population, migrated to Southeast Asia from what is now Taiwan. They arrived in the archipelago around 2,000 BCE and confined the native Melanesians to the far eastern regions as they spread east.\n\n**Early History**\n\nFossilised remains of Homo erectus, popularly known as the \"Java Man\", suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited two million to 500,000 years ago. Homo sapiens reached the region around 43,000 BCE. Austronesian peoples, who form the majority of the modern population, migrated to Southeast Asia from what is now Taiwan. They arrived in the archipelago around 2,000 BCE and confined the native Melanesians to the far eastern regions as they spread east.\n\n**Colonial Era**\n\nThe first Europeans arrived in the archipelago in 1512, when Portuguese traders, led by Francisco Serrão, sought to monopolise the sources of nutmeg, cloves, and cubeb pepper in the Maluku Islands. Dutch and British traders followed. In 1602, the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company (Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie; VOC) and became the dominant European power for almost 200 years. The VOC was dissolved in 1799 following bankruptcy, and the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalised colony.\n\n**Post-World War II**\n\nAs president, Sukarno moved Indonesia from democracy towards authoritarianism and maintained power by balancing the opposing forces of the military, political Islam, and the increasingly powerful Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI). Tensions between the military and the PKI culminated in an attempted coup in 1965. The army, led by Major General Suharto, countered by instigating a violent anti-communist purge that killed between 500,000 and one million people and incarcerated roughly a million more in concentration camps. Suharto capitalised on Sukarno's weakened position, and following a drawn-out power play with Sukarno, Suharto was appointed president in March 1968.\n\n**Geography**\n\nIndonesia is the southernmost country in Asia. The country lies between 11°S and 6°N latitude, and 95°E and 141°E longitude. A transcontinental country spanning Southeast Asia and Oceania, it is the world's largest archipelagic state. The country's vast territory comprises 17,504 islands, with 6,000 of them inhabited. The largest islands are Sumatra, Java, Borneo (shared with Brunei and Malaysia), Sulawesi, and New Guinea (shared with Papua New Guinea).\n\n**Climate**\n\nIndonesia lies along the equator, and its climate tends to be relatively even year-round. Indonesia has two seasons – a dry season and a wet season – with no extremes of summer or winter. For most parts of Indonesia, the dry season falls between May and October, while the wet season falls between November and April. Indonesia's climate is almost entirely tropical, dominated by the tropical rainforest climate found on every large island of Indonesia. Cooler climate types exist in mountainous regions that are 1,300 to 1,500 metres above sea level.\n\n**Geology**\n\nTectonically, most of Indonesia's area is highly unstable, making it a site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes. It lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire, where the Indo-Australian Plate and the Pacific Plate are pushed under the Eurasian Plate, where they melt at about 100 kilometres deep. A string of volcanoes runs through Sumatra, Java, Bali and Nusa Tenggara, and then to the Banda Islands of Maluku to northeastern Sulawesi. Of the 400 volcanoes, around 130 are active.\n\n**Biodiversity and Conservation**\n\nIndonesia's size, tropical climate, and archipelagic geography support one of the world's highest levels of biodiversity, and it is among the 17 megadiverse countries identified by Conservation International. Its flora and fauna are a mixture of Asian and Australasian species. The Sunda Shelf islands (Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Bali) were once linked to mainland Asia and have a wealth of Asian fauna. Large species such as the Sumatran tiger, rhinoceros, orangutan, Asian elephant, and leopard were once abundant as far east as Bali, but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically.\n\n**Government and Politics**\n\nIndonesia is a republic with a presidential system. Following the fall of the New Order in 1998, political and governmental structures have undergone sweeping reforms, with four constitutional amendments revamping the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The President of Indonesia is the head of state and head of government, commander-in-chief of the Indonesian National Armed Forces (Tentara Nasional Indonesia, TNI), and the director of domestic governance, policy-making, and foreign affairs.\n\n**Parties and Elections**\n\nSince 1999, Indonesia has had a multi-party system. In all legislative elections since the fall of the New Order, no political party has won an overall majority of seats. The Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) secured the most votes in the 2024 general election, becoming their third consecutive wins since 2014.\n\n**Administrative Divisions**\n\nIndonesia has several levels of subdivisions. The first level are the provinces, which have a legislature (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah, DPRD) and an elected governor. A total of 38 provinces have been established from the original eight in 1945, with the most recent change being the split of Southwest Papua from the province of West Papua in 2022.\n\n**Foreign Relations**\n\nIndonesia maintains 132 diplomatic missions abroad, including 95 embassies. The country adheres to what it calls a \"free and active\" foreign policy, seeking a role in regional affairs in proportion to its size and location but avoiding involvement in conflicts among other countries.\n\n**Military**\n\nIndonesia's Armed Forces (TNI) include the Army (TNI-AD), Navy (TNI-AL, which includes Marine Corps), and Air Force (TNI-AU). The army has about 400,000 active-duty personnel. Defence spending in the national budget was 0.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018.\n\n**Economy**\n\nIndonesia has a mixed economy in which the private sector and government play vital roles. As the only G20 member state in Southeast Asia, the country has the largest economy in the region and is classified as a newly industrialised country. Per a 2023 estimate, Indonesia is the world's 16th largest economy by nominal GDP and 7th in terms of GDP at PPP.\n\n**Tourism**\n\nTourism contributed around US$9.8 billion to GDP in 2020, and in the previous year, Indonesia received 15.4 million visitors. Overall, Australia, China, Singapore, Malaysia, and Japan are the top five sources of visitors to Indonesia. Since 2011, Wonderful Indonesia has been the country's international marketing campaign slogan to promote tourism.\n\n**Science and Technology**\n\nGovernment expenditure on research and development is relatively low (0.3% of GDP in 2019), and Indonesia ranked 54th (from 133 countries) on the 2024 Global Innovation Index report and performance above expectation for the level of development in upper-middle-income group. Historical examples of scientific and technological developments include the paddy cultivation technique terasering, which is common in Southeast Asia, and the pinisi boats by the Bugis and Makassar people.\n\n**Infrastructure**\n\nIndonesia's transport system has been shaped over time by the economic resource base of an archipelago and the distribution of its 275 million people highly concentrated on Java. In 2016, the transport sector generated about 5.2% of GDP. The road transport system has a total length of 542,310 kilometres as of 2018. Jakarta has the most extended bus rapid transit system globally, boasting 251.2 kilometres in 13 corridors and ten cross-corridor routes.\n\n**Energy**\n\nIn 2019, Indonesia produced 4,999 terawatt-hours and consumed 2,357 terawatt-hours worth of energy. The country has substantial energy resources, including 22 billion barrels of conventional oil and gas reserves (of which about 4 billion barrels are recoverable), 8 billion barrels of oil-equivalent coal-based methane (CBM) resources, and 28 billion tonnes of recoverable coal.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nThe 2020 census recorded Indonesia's population as 270.2 million, the fourth largest in the world, with a moderately high population growth rate of 1.25%. Java is the world's most populous island, where 56% of the country's population lives. The population density is 141 people per square kilometre, ranking 88th in the world, although Java has a population density of 1,067 people per square kilometre.\n\n**Ethnic Groups and Languages**\n\nIndonesia is an ethnically diverse country, with around 1,300 distinct native ethnic groups. Most Indonesians are descended from Austronesian peoples whose languages had origins in Proto-Austronesian, which possibly originated in what is now Taiwan. Another major grouping is the Melanesians, who inhabit eastern Indonesia (the Maluku Islands, Western New Guinea, and the eastern part of the Lesser Sunda Islands).\n\n**Religion**\n\nAlthough the government officially recognises only six religions – Islam, Protestantism, Roman Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and indigenous religions for administrative purposes, religious freedom is guaranteed in the country's constitution. With 244 million adherents (87.1%) in 2023, Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim-majority country, with Sunnis being the majority (99%). The Shias and Ahmadis, respectively, constitute 1% and 0.2% of Muslims.\n\n**Education**\n\nEducation is compulsory for 12 years. Parents can choose between state-run, non-sectarian schools or private or semi-private religious (usually Islamic) schools, supervised by the ministries of Education and Religion, respectively. Private international schools that do not follow the national curriculum are also available. The enrolment rate is 93% for primary education, 79% for secondary education, and 36% for tertiary education (2018). The literacy rate is 96% (2018), and the government spends about 3.6% of GDP (2015) on education.\n\n**Healthcare**\n\nGovernment expenditure on healthcare was about 3.3% of GDP in 2016. As part of an attempt to achieve universal health care, the government launched the National Health Insurance (Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional, JKN) in 2014. It includes coverage for a range of services from the public and also private firms that have opted to join the scheme.

Today, the Indonesian music industry has notable regional popularity in Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei due to the common culture and mutual intelligibility between Indonesian and Malay.\n\n**Theatre and Cinema**\n\nWayang, the Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese shadow puppet theatre displays several legends from Hindu mythology such as the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Other forms of local drama include the Javanese Ludruk and Ketoprak, the Sundanese Sandiwara, Betawi Lenong, and various Balinese dance dramas.

Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Indonesia\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe name Indonesia derives from the Greek words Indos (Ἰνδός) and nesos (νῆσος), meaning \"Indian islands\" [12] The name dates back to the 19th century, far predating the formation of independent Indonesia In 1850, George Windsor Earl, an English ethnologist, proposed the terms Indunesians—and, his preference, Malayunesians—for the inhabitants of the \"Indian Archipelago or Malay Archipelago\" [13] [14] In the same publication, one of his students, James Richardson Logan, used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago [15] [16] Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia They preferred Malay Archipelago (Dutch: Maleische Archipel); the Netherlands East Indies (Nederlandsch Oost Indië), popularly Indië; the East (de Oost); and Insulinde [17]\n\n\nHistory\nFossilised remains of Homo erectus, popularly known as the \"Java Man\", suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited two million to 500,000 years ago [19] [20] [21] Homo sapiens reached the region around 43,000 BCE [22] Austronesian peoples, who form the majority of the modern population, migrated to Southeast Asia from what is now Taiwan They arrived in the archipelago around 2,000 BCE and confined the native Melanesians to the far eastern regions as they spread east [23]\n\n\nEarly history\nFossilised remains of Homo erectus, popularly known as the \"Java Man\", suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited two million to 500,000 years ago [19] [20] [21] Homo sapiens reached the region around 43,000 BCE [22] Austronesian peoples, who form the majority of the modern population, migrated to Southeast Asia from what is now Taiwan They arrived in the archipelago around 2,000 BCE and confined the native Melanesians to the far eastern regions as they spread east [23]\n\n\nColonial era\nThe first Europeans arrived in the archipelago in 1512, when Portuguese traders, led by Francisco Serrão, sought to monopolise the sources of nutmeg, cloves, and cubeb pepper in the Maluku Islands [33] Dutch and British traders followed In 1602, the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company (Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie; VOC) and became the dominant European power for almost 200 years The VOC was dissolved in 1799 following bankruptcy, and the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalised colony [34]\n\n\nPost-World War II\nAs president, Sukarno moved Indonesia from democracy towards authoritarianism and maintained power by balancing the opposing forces of the military, political Islam, and the increasingly powerful Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) [51] Tensions between the military and the PKI culminated in an attempted coup in 1965 The army, led by Major General Suharto, countered by instigating a violent anti-communist purge that killed between 500,000 and one million people and incarcerated roughly a million more in concentration camps [52] [53] [54] [55] The PKI was blamed for the coup and effectively destroyed [56] [57] [58] Suharto capitalised on Sukarno's weakened position, and following a drawn-out power play with Sukarno, Suharto was appointed president in March 1968 His US-backed \"New Order\" administration [59] [60] [61] [62] encouraged foreign direct investment, [63] [64] [65] which was a crucial factor in the subsequent three decades of substantial economic growth.\n\n\nGeography\nIndonesia is the southernmost country in Asia The country lies between latitudes 11°S and 6°N and longitudes 95°E and 141°E A transcontinental country spanning Southeast Asia and Oceania, it is the world's largest archipelagic state, extending 5,120 kilometres (3,181 mi) from east to west and 1,760 kilometres (1,094 mi) from north to south [75] The country's Coordinating Ministry for Maritime and Investments Affairs says Indonesia has 17,504 islands (with 16,056 registered at the UN) [76] scattered over both sides of the equator, around 6,000 of which are inhabited [77] The largest are Sumatra, Java, Borneo (shared with Brunei and Malaysia), Sulawesi, and New Guinea (shared with Papua New Guinea) [78] Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on Borneo and Sebatik, Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea, East Timor on the island of Timor, and maritime borders with Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Palau, and Australia.\n\n\nClimate\nIndonesia lies along the equator, and its climate tends to be relatively even year-round [80] Indonesia has two seasons—a dry season and a wet season—with no extremes of summer or winter [81] For most parts of Indonesia, the dry season falls between May and October, while the wet season falls between November and April [81] Indonesia's climate is almost entirely tropical, dominated by the tropical rainforest climate found on every large island of Indonesia Cooler climate types exist in mountainous regions that are 1,300 to 1,500 metres (4,300 to 4,900 feet) above sea level The oceanic climate (Köppen Cfb) prevails in highland areas adjacent to rainforest climates, with uniform precipitation year-round In highland areas near the tropical monsoon and tropical savanna climates, the subtropical highland climate (Köppen Cwb) is more pronounced during dry season [82]\n\n\nGeology\nTectonically, most of Indonesia's area is highly unstable, making it a site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes [91] It lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire, where the Indo-Australian Plate and the Pacific Plate are pushed under the Eurasian Plate, where they melt at about 100 kilometres (62 miles) deep A string of volcanoes runs through Sumatra, Java, Bali and Nusa Tenggara, and then to the Banda Islands of Maluku to northeastern Sulawesi [92] Of the 400 volcanoes, around 130 are active [91] Between 1972 and 1991, there were 29 volcanic eruptions, mostly on Java [93] Volcanic ash has made agricultural conditions unpredictable in some areas [94] However, it has also resulted in fertile soils, a factor in historically sustaining the high population densities of Java and Bali [95]\n\n\nBiodiversity and conservation\nIndonesia's size, tropical climate, and archipelagic geography support one of the world's highest levels of biodiversity, and it is among the 17 megadiverse countries identified by Conservation International Its flora and fauna are a mixture of Asian and Australasian species [99] [100] The Sunda Shelf islands (Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Bali) were once linked to mainland Asia and have a wealth of Asian fauna Large species such as the Sumatran tiger, rhinoceros, orangutan, Asian elephant, and leopard were once abundant as far east as Bali, but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically Having been long separated from the continental landmasses, Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, and Maluku have developed their unique flora and fauna [101] [102] Papua was part of the Australian landmass and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia, including over 600 bird species [103]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nIndonesia is a republic with a presidential system Following the fall of the New Order in 1998, political and governmental structures have undergone sweeping reforms, with four constitutional amendments revamping the executive, legislative and judicial branches [131] Chief among them is the delegation of power and authority to various regional entities while remaining a unitary state [132] The President of Indonesia is the head of state and head of government, commander-in-chief of the Indonesian National Armed Forces (Tentara Nasional Indonesia, TNI), and the director of domestic governance, policy-making, and foreign affairs The president may serve a maximum of two consecutive five-year terms [133]\n\n\nParties and elections\nSince 1999, Indonesia has had a multi-party system In all legislative elections since the fall of the New Order, no political party has won an overall majority of seats The Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) secured the most votes in the 2024 general election, becoming their third consecutive wins since 2014 [140] Other notable parties include the Party of the Functional Groups (Golkar), the Great Indonesia Movement Party (Gerindra), the Democratic Party, and the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS).\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nIndonesia has several levels of subdivisions The first level are the provinces, which have a legislature (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah, DPRD) and an elected governor A total of 38 provinces have been established from the original eight in 1945, [143] the most recent change being the split of Southwest Papua from the province of West Papua in 2022 [144] The second level are the regencies (kabupaten) and cities (kota), led by regents (bupati) and mayors (walikota), respectively, and a legislature (DPRD Kabupaten/Kota) The third level are the districts (kecamatan, distrik in Papua, or kapanewon and kemantren in Yogyakarta), and the fourth are the villages (either desa, kelurahan, kampung, nagari in West Sumatra, or gampong in Aceh) [145]\n\n\nForeign relations\nIndonesia maintains 132 diplomatic missions abroad, including 95 embassies [151] The country adheres to what it calls a \"free and active\" foreign policy, seeking a role in regional affairs in proportion to its size and location but avoiding involvement in conflicts among other countries [152]\n\n\nMilitary\nIndonesia's Armed Forces (TNI) include the Army (TNI–AD), Navy (TNI–AL, which includes Marine Corps), and Air Force (TNI–AU) The army has about 400,000 active-duty personnel Defence spending in the national budget was 0.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018, [165] with controversial involvement of military-owned commercial interests and foundations [166] The Armed Forces were formed during the Indonesian National Revolution when it undertook guerrilla warfare along with informal militia Since then, territorial lines have formed the basis of all TNI branches' structure, aimed at maintaining domestic stability and deterring foreign threats [167] The military has possessed a strong political influence since its founding, which peaked during the New Order Political reforms in 1998 included the removal of the TNI's formal representation from the legislature Nevertheless, its political influence remains, albeit at a reduced level [168]\n\n\nEconomy\nIndonesia has a mixed economy in which the private sector and government play vital roles [181] As the only G20 member state in Southeast Asia, [182] the country has the largest economy in the region and is classified as a newly industrialised country Per a 2023 estimate, it is the world's 16th largest economy by nominal GDP and 7th in terms of GDP at PPP, estimated to be US$1.417 trillion and US$4.393 trillion, respectively Per capita GDP in PPP is US$15,835, while nominal per capita GDP is US$5,108 [7] Services are the economy's largest sector and account for 43.4% of GDP (2018), followed by industry (39.7%) and agriculture (12.8%) [183] Since 2009, it has employed more people than other sectors, accounting for 47.7% of the total labour force, followed by agriculture (30.2%) and industry (21.9%) [184]\n\n\nTourism\nTourism contributed around US$9.8 billion to GDP in 2020, and in the previous year, Indonesia received 15.4 million visitors [199] Overall, Australia, China, Singapore, Malaysia, and Japan are the top five sources of visitors to Indonesia [200] Since 2011, Wonderful Indonesia has been the country's international marketing campaign slogan to promote tourism [201]\n\n\nScience and technology\nGovernment expenditure on research and development is relatively low (0.3% of GDP in 2019), [205] and Indonesia ranked 54th (from 133 countries) on the 2024 Global Innovation Index report and performance above expectation for level of development in uppermiddle-income group [206] Historical examples of scientific and technological developments include the paddy cultivation technique terasering, which is common in Southeast Asia, and the pinisi boats by the Bugis and Makassar people [207] In the 1980s, Indonesian engineer Tjokorda Raka Sukawati invented a road construction technique named Sosrobahu that later became widely used in several countries [208] The country is also an active producer of passenger trains and freight wagons with its state-owned company, the Indonesian Railway Industry (INKA), and has exported trains abroad [209]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nIndonesia's transport system has been shaped over time by the economic resource base of an archipelago and the distribution of its 275 million people highly concentrated on Java [218] In 2016, the transport sector generated about 5.2% of GDP [219] The road transport system has a total length of 542,310 kilometres (336,980 miles) as of 2018 [update] [220] Jakarta has the most extended bus rapid transit system globally, boasting 251.2 kilometres (156.1 miles) in 13 corridors and ten cross-corridor routes [221] Rickshaws such as bajaj and becak and share taxis such as Angkot and Minibus are a regular sight in the country.\n\n\nTransport\nIndonesia's transport system has been shaped over time by the economic resource base of an

cross-corridor routes [221] Rickshaws such as bajaj and becak and share taxis such as Angkot and Minibus are a regular sight in the country.\n\n\nEnergy\nIn 2019, Indonesia produced 4,999 terawatt-hours (17.059 quadrillion British thermal units) and consumed 2,357 terawatt-hours (8.043 quadrillion British thermal units) worth of energy [226] The country has substantial energy resources, including 22 billion barrels (3.5 billion cubic metres) of conventional oil and gas reserves (of which about 4 billion barrels are recoverable), 8 billion barrels of oil-equivalent coal-based methane (CBM) resources, and 28 billion tonnes of recoverable coal [227]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe 2020 census recorded Indonesia's population as 270.2 million, the fourth largest in the world, with a moderately high population growth rate of 1.25% [231] Java is the world's most populous island, [232] where 56% of the country's population lives [6] The population density is 141 people per square kilometre (370 people/sq mi), [6] ranking 88th in the world, although Java has a population density of 1,067 people per square kilometre (2,760 people/sq mi) In 1961, the first post-colonial census recorded a total of 97 million people [233] It is expected to grow to around 295 million by 2030 and 321 million by 2050 [234] The country currently possesses a relatively young population, with a median age of 30.2 years (2017 estimate) [77]\n\n\nEthnic groups and languages\nIndonesia is an ethnically diverse country, with around 1,300 distinct native ethnic groups [2] Most Indonesians are descended from Austronesian peoples whose languages had origins in Proto-Austronesian, which possibly originated in what is now Taiwan Another major grouping is the Melanesians, who inhabit eastern Indonesia (the Maluku Islands, Western New Guinea, and the eastern part of the Lesser Sunda Islands) [23] [239] [240] [241]\n\n\nReligion\nAlthough the government officially recognises only six religions: Islam, Protestantism, Roman Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, [254] [255] and indigenous religions for administrative purpose, [255] [256] religious freedom is guaranteed in the country's constitution [257] [135] With 244 million adherents (87.1%) in 2023, Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim-majority country, [258] [259] with Sunnis being the majority (99%) [260] The Shias and Ahmadis, respectively, constitute 1% (1–3 million) and 0.2% (200,000–400,000) of Muslims [255] [261] About 10% of Indonesians are Christians, who form the majority in several provinces in eastern Indonesia [262] Most Hindus are Balinese, [263] and most Buddhists are Chinese Indonesians [264]\n\n\nEducation\nEducation is compulsory for 12 years [292] Parents can choose between state-run, non-sectarian schools or private or semi-private religious (usually Islamic) schools, supervised by the ministries of Education and Religion, respectively [293] Private international schools that do not follow the national curriculum are also available The enrolment rate is 93% for primary education, 79% for secondary education, and 36% for tertiary education (2018) [294] The literacy rate is 96% (2018), and the government spends about 3.6% of GDP (2015) on education [294] In 2018, there were 4,670 higher educational institutions in Indonesia, with most (74%) located in Sumatra and Java [295] [296] According to the QS World University Rankings, Indonesia's top universities are the University of Indonesia, Gadjah Mada University, and the Bandung Institute of Technology [297]\n\n\nHealthcare\nGovernment expenditure on healthcare was about 3.3% of GDP in 2016 [298] As part of an attempt to achieve universal health care, the government launched the National Health Insurance (Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional, JKN) in 2014 [299] It includes coverage for a range of services from the public and also private firms that have opted to join the scheme Despite remarkable improvements in recent decades, such as rising life expectancy (from 62.3 years in 1990 to 71.7 years in 2019) [300] and declining child mortality (from 84 deaths per 1,000 births in 1990 to 23.9 deaths in 2019), [301] challenges remain, including maternal and child health, low air quality, malnutrition, a high rate of smoking, and infectious diseases [302]\n\n\nHuman rights\nIn the economic sphere, there is a gap in wealth, unemployment rate, and health between densely populated islands and economic centres (such as Sumatra and Java) and sparsely populated, disadvantaged areas (such as Maluku and Papua) [303] [304] This is created by a situation in which nearly 80% of Indonesia's population lives in the western parts of the archipelago [305] and yet grows slower than the rest of the country.\n\n\nCulture\nThe cultural history of the Indonesian archipelago spans more than two millennia Influences from the Indian subcontinent, mainland China, the Middle East, Europe, [313] [314] Melanesian, and Austronesian peoples have historically shaped the cultural, linguistic and religious makeup of the archipelago As a result, modern-day Indonesia has a multicultural, multilingual and multi-ethnic society, [1] [2] with a complex cultural mixture that differs significantly from the original indigenous cultures Indonesia currently holds thirteen items of UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage, including a wayang puppet theatre, kris, batik, [315] pencak silat, angklung, gamelan, and the three genres of traditional Balinese dance [316]\n\n\nArt and architecture\nIndonesian arts include both age-old art forms developed through centuries and recently developed contemporary art Indonesian arts have absorbed foreign influences—most notably from India, the Arab world, China, and Europe—due to contacts and interactions facilitated, and often motivated by trade [317] Painting is an established and developed art in Bali, where its people are famed for their artistry Their painting tradition started as classical Kamasan or Wayang style visual narrative, derived from visual art discovered on candi bas reliefs in eastern Java [318]\n\n\nMusic, dance and clothing\nThe music of Indonesia predates historical records Various indigenous tribes incorporate chants and songs accompanied by musical instruments in their rituals Angklung, kacapi suling, gong, gamelan, talempong, kulintang, and sasando are examples of traditional Indonesian instruments These include gambus and qasida from the Middle East, [324] keroncong from Portugal, [325] and dangdut—one of Indonesia's most popular music genres—with Hindi influence as well as Malay orchestras [326] Today, the Indonesian music industry has notable regional popularity in Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei [327] [328] due to the common culture and mutual intelligibility between Indonesian and Malay [329]\n\n\nTheatre and cinema\nWayang, the Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese shadow puppet theatre displays several legends from Hindu mythology such as the Ramayana and the Mahabharata [334] Other forms of local drama include the Javanese Ludruk and Ketoprak, the Sundanese Sandiwara, Betawi Lenong, [335] [336] and various Balinese dance dramas They incorporate humour and jest and often involve audiences in their performances [337] Some theatre traditions also include music, dancing and silat martial art, such as Randai from the Minangkabau people of West Sumatra It is usually performed for traditional ceremonies and festivals [338] [339] and based on semi-historical Minangkabau legends and love story [339] Modern performing art also developed in Indonesia with its distinct style of drama Notable theatre, dance, and drama troupes such as Teater Koma are famous as they often portray social and political satire of Indonesian society [340]\n\n\nMass media and literature\nMedia freedom increased considerably after the fall of the New Order, during which the Ministry of Information monitored and controlled domestic media and restricted foreign media [346] The television market includes several national commercial networks and provincial networks that compete with public TVRI, which held a monopoly on TV broadcasting from 1962 to 1989 By the early 21st century, the communications system had brought television signals to every village, and people can choose from up to 11 channels [347] Private radio stations carry news bulletins while foreign broadcasters supply programmes The number of printed publications has increased significantly since 1998 [347]\n\n\nCuisine\nIndonesian cuisine has many regional cuisines, often based upon indigenous culture and foreign influences such as Chinese, African, European, Middle Eastern, and Indian precedents [358] Rice is the leading staple food and is served with side dishes of meat and vegetables Spices (notably chili), coconut milk, fish, and chicken are fundamental ingredients [359]\n\n\nSports\nBadminton and football are the most popular sports in Indonesia Indonesia is among the few countries that have won the Thomas and Uber Cup, the world team championship of men's and women's badminton Along with weightlifting, it is the sport that contributes the most to Indonesia's Olympic medal tally Liga 1 is the country's premier football club league On the international stage, Indonesia was the first Asian team to participate in the FIFA World Cup in 1938 as the Dutch East Indies [362] On a regional level, Indonesia won a bronze medal at the 1958 Asian Games as well as three gold medals at the 1987, 1991, and 2023 Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games) Indonesia's first appearance at the AFC Asian Cup was in 1996 [363]\n\n\nSee also\n5°S 120°E﻿ / ﻿5°S

[1]: 5, 195  It flew in space for the first time in April 1981, [2]: III-24  and was used to conduct in-orbit research, [2]: III-188  and deploy commercial, military, and scientific payloads [2]: III-66, 68, 148  At launch, it consisted of the orbiter, which contained the crew and payload, the external tank (ET), and the two solid rocket boosters (SRBs) [3]: 363  The orbiter was a reusable, winged vehicle that launched vertically and landed as a glider [2]: II-1  Five operational orbiters were built during the Space Shuttle program [1]: 5  Columbia was the first space-rated orbiter constructed, following the atmospheric test vehicle  Enterprise The orbiter contained the crew compartment, where the crew predominantly lived and worked throughout a mission [2]: II-5  Three Space Shuttle main engines (SSMEs) were mounted at the aft end of the orbiter and provided thrust during launch [3]: II-170  Once in space, the crew maneuvered using the two smaller, aft-mounted

Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) engines [3]: II-79 \n\n\nDebris strike concerns\nDuring the design process of the Space Shuttle, a requirement of the ET was that it would not release any debris that could potentially damage the orbiter and its TPS The integrity of the TPS components was necessary for the survival of the crew during reentry, and the tiles and panels were only built to withstand relatively minor impacts On STS-1, the first flight of the Space Shuttle, the orbiter Columbia was damaged during its launch from a foam strike Foam strikes occurred regularly during Space Shuttle launches; of the 79 missions with available imagery during launch, foam strikes occurred on 65 of them [5]: 121–122 \n\n\nFlight\nFor STS-107, Columbia carried the SpaceHab Research Double Module, the Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment, and an Extended Duration Orbiter pallet [5]: 30  The mission passed its pre-launch certifications and reviews, and began with the launch The mission was originally scheduled to launch on January 11, 2001, but it was delayed thirteen times, until its launch on January 16, 2003 [5]: 28 \n\n\nSpace Shuttle mission\nFor STS-107, Columbia carried the

strike\nColumbia launched from the Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at 10:39:00 am At T+81.7 seconds, a piece of foam approximately 21 to 27 inches (53 to 69 cm) long and 12 to 18 inches (30 to 46 cm) wide broke off from the left bipod on the ET At T+81.9 seconds, the foam struck the reinforced carbon–carbon (RCC) panels on Columbia's left wing at relative velocity of 625 to 840 feet per second (426 to 573 mph; 686 to 922 km/h) [5]: 34  The foam's low ballistic coefficient caused it to lose speed immediately after separating from the ET, and the orbiter ran into the slower foam [5]: 60  Neither the mission nor ground crew noticed the debris strike at the time [5]: 140  The SRBs separated from the ET at T+2 minutes and 7 seconds, followed by the ET's separation from the orbiter at T+8 minutes 30 seconds [5]: 35  The ET separation was photographed by Anderson and recorded by Brown, but they did not record the bipod with missing foam [5]: 148  At T+43 minutes, Columbia completed its orbital insertion as planned [5]: 35 \n\n\nFlight risk management\nAfter Columbia entered orbit, the NASA Intercenter Photo Working Group conducted a routine review of videos of the launch The group's analysts did not notice the debris strike until the second day of the mission None of the cameras that recorded the launch had a clear view of the debris striking the wing, leaving the group unable to determine the level of damage sustained by the orbiter The group's chair contacted Wayne Hale, the Shuttle Program Manager for Launch Integration, to request on-orbit pictures of Columbia's wing to assess its damage After receiving notification of the debris strike, engineers at NASA, United Space Alliance, and Boeing created the Debris Assessment Team and began working to determine the damage to the orbiter [5]: 140, 143  Intercenter Photo Working Group believed that the orbiter's RCC tiles were possibly damaged; NASA program managers were less concerned over the danger caused by the debris strike [5]: 141 \n\n\nReentry\nColumbia was scheduled to reenter the atmosphere and land on February 1, 2003 At 3:30 am EST the Entry Flight Control Team started its shift at the Mission Control Center [5]: 38  On board the orbiter, the crew stowed loose items and prepared their equipment for reentry [14]: 1.5 \n\n\nCrew survivability\nDuring reentry, all seven of the STS-107 crew members were killed, but the exact time of their deaths could not be determined The level of acceleration that they experienced during crew module breakup was not lethal [5]: 77  The first lethal event the crew experienced was the depressurization of the crew module The rate and exact time of complete depressurization could not be determined, but it occurred no later than 9:00:59 and was likely much earlier The remains of the crew members indicated they all experienced depressurization The astronauts' helmets have a visor that, when closed, can temporarily protect the crew member from depressurization None of the crew members had closed their visors, and one was not wearing a helmet; this would indicate that depressurization occurred quickly before they could take protective measures They were rendered unconscious or deceased within seconds and tissue damage was extensive enough that they could not have regained consciousness even if the cabin had regained pressurization [14]: 1.24  [18]: 89, 103 \n\n\nPresidential response\nAt 14:04 EST (19:04 UTC), President George W Bush said in a televised address to the nation, \"My fellow Americans, this day has brought terrible news, and great sadness to our country At 9:00 a.m this morning, Mission Control in Houston lost contact with our Space Shuttle Columbia A short time later, debris was seen falling from the skies above Texas The Columbia is lost; there are no survivors.\" [19]\n\n\nRecovery of debris\nAfter the orbiter broke up, reports came in to eastern Texas law enforcement agencies of an explosion and falling debris [17]: 59  Astronauts Mark Kelly and Gregory Johnson traveled on a US Coast Guard helicopter from Houston to Nacogdoches, [17]: 61  and Jim Wetherbee drove a team of astronauts to Lufkin to assist with recovery efforts [17]: 61  Debris was reported from east Texas through southern Louisiana [17]: 96  Recovery crews and local volunteers worked to locate and identify debris [17]: 93 \n\n\nColumbia Accident Investigation Board\nAbout ninety minutes after the disaster, NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe called to convene the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) to determine the cause [5]: 231  [33] It was chaired by retired U.S Navy Admiral Harold W Gehman, Jr and included military and civilian analysts It initially consisted of eight members, including Gehman, but expanded to 13 members by March The CAIB members were notified by noon on the day of the accident, and participated in a teleconference that evening The following day, they traveled to Barksdale AFB to begin the investigation The CAIB members first toured the debris fields, and then established their operations at JSC The CAIB established four teams to investigate NASA management and program safety, NASA training and crew operations, the technical aspects of the disaster, and how NASA culture affected the Space Shuttle program These groups collaborated, and hired other support staff to investigate [5]: 231–232  The CAIB worked alongside the reconstruction efforts to determine the cause of the accident, and interviewed members of the Space Shuttle program, including those who had been involved with STS-107 [5]: 234–235  The CAIB conducted public hearings from March until June, [5]: 237–238  and released its final report in August 2003 [5]: 2 \n\n\nCause of the accident\nAfter looking at sensor data, the CAIB considered damage to the left wing as a likely culprit for Columbia's destruction It investigated that recovered debris and noted the difference in heat damage between the two wings RCC panels from the left wing were found in the western portion of the debris field, indicating that it was shed first before the rest of the orbiter disintegrated [5]: 73–74  X-ray and chemical analysis was conducted on the RCC panels, revealing the highest levels of slag deposits to be in the left wing tiles [5]: 75–76  Impact testing was conducted at the Southwest Research Institute, using a nitrogen-powered gun to fire a projectile made of the same material as the ET bipod foam Panels taken from Enterprise,  Discovery, and Atlantis were used to determine the projectiles' effect on RCC panels [5]: 79–80  A test on RCC panel 8, taken from Atlantis, was the most consistent with the damage observed on Columbia, indicating it was the damaged panel that led to the in-flight breakup [5]: 82–83 \n\n\nOrganizational culture\nThe CAIB was critical of NASA organizational culture, and compared its current state to that of NASA leading up to the Challenger disaster [5]: 99  It concluded that NASA was experiencing budget constraints while still expecting to keep a high level of launches and operations [5]: 100  Program operating costs were lowered by 21% from 1991 to 1994, [5]: 107  despite a planned increase in the yearly flight rate for assembly of the International Space Station [5]: 114  Despite a history of foam strike events, NASA management did not consider the potential risk to the astronauts as a safety-of-flight issue [5]: 126  The CAIB found that a lack of a safety program led to the lack of concern over foam strikes [5]: 177  The board determined that NASA lacked the appropriate communication and integration channels to allow problems to be discussed and effectively routed and addressed [5]: 187  This risk was further compounded by pressure to adhere to a launch schedule for construction of the ISS [5]: 198 \n\n\nPossible emergency procedures\nIn its report, the CAIB discussed potential options that could have saved Columbia's crew [34] They determined that the mission could have been extended to at most 30 days (February 15), after which the lithium hydroxide canisters used to remove carbon dioxide would have run out [5]: 173  On STS-107, Columbia was carrying the Extended Duration Orbiter, which increased its supply of oxygen and hydrogen [35]: 398  To maximize the mission duration, non-essential systems would have been powered down, [35]: 399  and animals in the Spacehab module would have been euthanized [35]: 397 \n\n\nNASA response\nThe Space Shuttle program was suspended after the loss of Columbia [36] The further construction of the International Space Station (ISS) was delayed, as the Space Shuttle had been scheduled for seven missions to the ISS in 2003 and 2004 to complete its construction [37]\nTo prevent future foam strikes, the ET was redesigned to remove foam from the bipod Instead, electric heaters were installed to prevent ice building up in the bipod due to the cold liquid oxygen in its feedlines [38] Additional heaters were also installed along the liquid oxygen line, which ran from the base of the tank to its interstage section [39] NASA also improved its ground imaging capabilities at Kennedy Space Center to better observe and monitor potential issues that occur during launch The existing cameras at LC-39A, LC-39B, and along the coast were upgraded, and nine new camera sites were added Cameras were added to the bellies of Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavour (only Columbia and Challenger had them prior) to allow digital images of the ET to be viewed on the ground soon after launch The prior system on Columbia used film and could only be downlinked after the orbiter returned to Earth [38] The Orbiter Boom Sensor System, a camera on the end of the Canadarm, was added to allow the crew to inspect the orbiter for any tile damage once they reached orbit [40] [41] Each of the orbiter's wings was equipped with 22 temperature sensors to detect any breaches during reentry and with 66 accelerometers to detect an impact Post-landing inspection procedures were updated to include technicians examining the RCC panels using flash thermography [40]\n\n\nSpace Shuttle updates\nThe Space Shuttle program was suspended after the loss of Columbia [36] The further construction of the International Space Station (ISS) was delayed, as the Space Shuttle had been scheduled for seven missions to the ISS in 2003 and 2004 to complete its construction [37]\nTo prevent future foam strikes, the ET was redesigned to remove foam from the

inspection procedures were updated to include technicians examining the RCC panels using flash thermography [40]\n\n\nFirst Return to Flight mission (STS-114)\nThe first Return to Flight mission, STS-114, began with the launch of Discovery on July 26, 2005, at 10:39 am (EDT) [43] Sixteen pieces of foam from the ET were dislodged during the launch that were large enough to be considered significant by NASA investigators, [44]: 7  including one piece that was approximately 36 by 11 inches (91 by 28 cm) [44]: 18  Post-launch investigations did not find any indications of damage from the foam loss, but ET video did reveal that a small piece of TPS tile from the nose landing gear fell off during launch [45] Upon reaching orbit the crew inspected Discovery with the Orbiter Boom Sensor System On July 29 Discovery rendezvoused with the ISS and, before docking, performed the first rendezvous pitch maneuver to allow the crew aboard the ISS to observe and photograph the orbiter's belly [46] The next day, astronauts Soichi Noguchi and Stephen Robinson performed the first of three spacewalks They tested a tile repair tool, the Emittance Wash Applicator, on intentionally damaged TPS tiles that had been brought in the payload bay [47]: 62  On August 3 the same astronauts performed the third EVA of the mission, during which Robinson stood on the ISS's Canadarm2 and went to Discovery's belly to remove two gap fillers between tiles that had begun to protrude [47]: 63  [48] After a delay due to bad weather at KSC, the decision was made to land at Edwards AFB Discovery successfully landed at 8:11 am (EDT) on August 9 [43] [46] Had Discovery been unable to safely land, the crew would have remained on the ISS until Atlantis was flown to rescue them [49] As a result of the foam loss, NASA grounded the Space Shuttle fleet again [36] [45]\n\n\nSecond Return to Flight mission (STS-121)\nTo address the problem of foam loss for the second Return to Flight mission (STS-121), NASA engineers removed the foam ramp from the protuberance air load (PAL) on the ET, which was the source of the largest piece of debris on STS-114 [50] The launch was postponed from its scheduled launch of July 1, 2006, and again on July 2 due to inclement weather at KSC [51] On July 3 a piece of foam approximately 3 by .25 inches (7.62 by 0.64 cm) and weighing 0.0057 pounds (2.6 g) broke off from the ET [52] [53] The mission still launched as scheduled at 2:38 pm (EDT) on July 4 [54] After reaching orbit, Discovery performed post-launch inspections of its TPS and docked with the ISS on July 6 [51] The orbiter carried a 28 feet (8.5 m) remote control orbiter in-flight maintenance cable that could connect the flight deck systems to the avionics system in the mid-deck; it would allow the spacecraft to be landed remotely, to include controlling the landing gear and deploying the parachute [55] [56] On July 12 astronauts Piers Sellers and Michael Fossum performed an EVA to test the NonOxide Adhesive eXperiment (NOAX), which applied protective sealant to samples of damaged TPS tiles [47]: 70  Discovery undocked from the ISS on July 14 and safely landed at 9:14 am on July 17 at KSC [51] Had the crew been stranded in orbit, NASA planned to launch Atlantis to rescue them from the ISS [57] [58]\n\n\nProgram cancellation\nIn January 2004 President Bush announced the Vision for Space Exploration, calling for the Space Shuttle fleet to complete the ISS and be retired by 2010, to be replaced by a newly developed Crew Exploration Vehicle for travel to the Moon and Mars [59] In 2004, NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe canceled a planned servicing of the Hubble Space Telescope and decided that future missions would all rendezvous with the ISS to ensure the safety of the crew [60] In 2006, his successor, Michael Griffin, decided to have one more servicing mission to the telescope, STS-125, which flew in May 2009 [61] [62] The retirement of the Space Shuttle was delayed until 2011, [63] [64] after which no further crewed spacecraft were launched from the United States until 2020 when SpaceX's Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission successfully carried NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Robert Behnken to the ISS [65]\n\n\nLegacy\nOn February 4, 2003, President Bush and his wife Laura led a memorial service for the astronauts' families at the Johnson Space Center Two days later, Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife Lynne led a similar service at Washington National Cathedral Patti LaBelle sang \"Way Up There\" as part of the service [66] A memorial service was held at KSC on February 7; Robert Crippen, the first pilot of Columbia, gave a eulogy for the crew and a tribute for Columbia herself, acknowledging her achievements as the first orbiter and NASA's flagship, her role in trying desperately to save the crew on STS-107, and her many missions dedicated to scientific research [17]: 155  On October 28, 2003, the names of the crew were added to the Space Mirror Memorial at the KSC Visitor Complex in Merritt Island, Florida, alongside the names of 17 other astronauts and cosmonauts who have died in the line of duty [67] On February 2, 2004, NASA Administrator O'Keefe unveiled a memorial for the STS-107 crew at Arlington National Cemetery, and it is located near the Challenger memorial [68] A tree for each astronaut was planted in NASA's Astronaut Memorial Grove at the Johnson Space Center, along with trees for each astronaut from the Apollo 1 and Challenger disasters [69] The exhibit Forever Remembered at KSC Visitor Complex features the cockpit window frames from Columbia [70] In 2004, Bush conferred posthumous Congressional Space Medals of Honor to all 14 crew members killed in the Challenger and Columbia accidents [71]\n\n\nSee also\n32°57′22″N

Space Shuttle Columbia disaster was a major accident in the history of space exploration, resulting in the loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia and its crew of seven astronauts on February 1, 2003. The disaster occurred during the STS-107 mission, which was the 28th mission of the Space Shuttle program.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Space Shuttle was a partially reusable spacecraft operated by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). It flew in space for the first time in April 1981 and was used to conduct in-orbit research and deploy commercial, military, and scientific payloads. The orbiter was a reusable, winged vehicle that launched vertically and landed as a glider. Five operational orbiters were built during the Space Shuttle program: Enterprise, Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, and Atlantis. Columbia was the first space-rated orbiter constructed, following the atmospheric test vehicle Enterprise.\n\n**Space Shuttle**\n\nThe Space Shuttle was a complex system consisting of the orbiter, the external tank (ET), and the two solid rocket boosters (SRBs). The orbiter contained the crew compartment, where the crew predominantly lived and worked throughout a mission. Three Space Shuttle main engines (SSMEs) were mounted at the aft end of the orbiter and provided thrust during launch. Once in space, the crew maneuvered using the two smaller, aft-mounted Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) engines.\n\n**Debris Strike Concerns**\n\nDuring the design process of the Space Shuttle, a requirement of the ET was that it would not release any debris that could potentially damage the orbiter and its Thermal Protection System (TPS). The integrity of the TPS components was necessary for the survival of the crew during reentry, and the tiles and panels were only built to withstand relatively minor impacts. Foam strikes occurred regularly during Space Shuttle launches, and of the 79 missions with available imagery during launch, foam strikes occurred on 65 of them.\n\n**Flight**\n\nFor STS-107, Columbia carried the SpaceHab Research Double Module, the Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment, and an Extended Duration Orbiter pallet. The mission passed its pre-launch certifications and reviews, and began with the launch. The mission was originally scheduled to launch on January 11, 2001, but it was delayed thirteen times, until its launch on January 16, 2003.\n\n**Launch and Debris Strike**\n\nColumbia launched from the Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at 10:39:00 am. At T+81.7 seconds, a piece of foam approximately 21 to 27 inches long and 12 to 18 inches wide broke off from the left bipod on the ET. At T+81.9 seconds, the foam struck the reinforced carbon–carbon (RCC) panels on Columbia's left wing at relative velocity of 625 to 840 feet per second. Neither the mission nor ground crew noticed the debris strike at the time.\n\n**Reentry**\n\nColumbia was scheduled to reenter the atmosphere and land on February 1, 2003. At 3:30 am EST, the Entry Flight Control Team started its shift at the Mission Control Center. On board the orbiter, the crew stowed loose items and prepared their equipment for reentry.\n\n**Crew Survivability**\n\nDuring reentry, all seven of the STS-107 crew members were killed. The level of acceleration that they experienced during crew module breakup was not lethal. The first lethal event the crew experienced was the depressurization of the crew module. The rate and exact time of complete depressurization could not be determined, but it occurred no later than 9:00:59 and was likely much earlier.\n\n**Presidential Response**\n\nAt 14:04 EST, President George W. Bush said in a televised address to the nation, \"My fellow Americans, this day has brought terrible news, and great sadness to our country. At 9:00 am this morning, Mission Control in Houston lost contact with our Space Shuttle Columbia. A short time later, debris was seen falling from the skies above Texas. The Columbia is lost; there are no survivors.\"\n\n**Recovery of Debris**\n\nAfter the orbiter broke up, reports came in to eastern Texas law enforcement agencies of an explosion and falling debris. Astronauts Mark Kelly and Gregory Johnson traveled on a US Coast Guard helicopter from Houston to Nacogdoches, and Jim Wetherbee drove a team of astronauts to Lufkin to assist with recovery efforts. Debris was reported from east Texas through southern Louisiana.\n\n**Columbia Accident Investigation Board**\n\nAbout ninety minutes after the disaster, NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe called to convene the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) to determine the cause. The CAIB was chaired by retired U.S. Navy Admiral Harold W. Gehman, Jr., and included military and civilian analysts. The CAIB members first toured the debris fields, and then established their operations at the Johnson Space Center.\n\n**Cause of the Accident**\n\nAfter looking at sensor data, the CAIB considered damage to the left wing as a likely culprit for Columbia's destruction. X-ray and chemical analysis was conducted on the RCC panels, revealing the highest levels of slag deposits to be in the left wing tiles. Impact testing was conducted at the Southwest Research Institute, using a nitrogen-powered gun to fire a projectile made of the same material as the ET bipod foam. The test on RCC panel 8, taken from Atlantis, was the most consistent with the damage observed on Columbia, indicating it was the damaged panel that led to the in-flight breakup.\n\n**Organizational Culture**\n\nThe CAIB was critical of NASA's organizational culture, comparing its current state to that of NASA leading up to the Challenger disaster. It concluded that NASA was experiencing budget constraints while still expecting to keep a high level of launches and operations. Program operating costs were lowered by 21% from 1991 to 1994, despite a planned increase in the yearly flight rate for assembly of the International Space Station. The CAIB found that a lack of a safety program led to the lack of concern over foam strikes, and the board determined that NASA lacked the appropriate communication and integration channels to allow problems to be discussed and effectively routed and addressed.\n\n**Possible Emergency Procedures**\n\nThe CAIB discussed potential options that could have saved Columbia's crew.

Post-launch investigations did not find any indications of damage from the foam loss, but ET video did reveal that a small piece of TPS tile from the nose landing gear fell off during launch. Upon reaching orbit, the crew inspected Discovery with the Orbiter Boom Sensor System, and on July 29, Discovery rendezvoused with the ISS.\n\n**Program Cancellation**\n\nIn January 2004, President Bush announced the Vision for Space Exploration, calling for the Space Shuttle fleet to complete the ISS and be retired by 2010, to be replaced by a newly developed Crew Exploration Vehicle for travel to the Moon and Mars.

strike\nColumbia launched from the Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at 10:39:00 am At T+81.7 seconds, a piece of foam approximately 21 to 27 inches (53 to 69 cm) long and 12 to 18 inches (30 to 46 cm) wide broke off from the left bipod on the ET At T+81.9 seconds, the foam struck the reinforced carbon–carbon (RCC) panels on Columbia's left wing at relative velocity of 625 to 840 feet per second (426 to 573 mph; 686 to 922 km/h) [5]: 34  The foam's low ballistic coefficient caused it to lose speed immediately after separating from the ET, and the orbiter ran into the slower foam [5]: 60  Neither the mission nor ground crew noticed the debris strike at the time [5]: 140  The SRBs separated from the ET at T+2 minutes and 7 seconds, followed by the ET's separation from the orbiter at T+8 minutes 30 seconds [5]: 35  The ET separation was photographed by Anderson and recorded by Brown, but they did not record the bipod with missing foam [5]: 148  At T+43 minutes, Columbia completed its orbital insertion as planned [5]: 35 \n\n\nFlight risk management\nAfter Columbia entered orbit, the NASA Intercenter Photo Working Group conducted a routine review of videos of the launch The group's analysts did not notice the debris strike until the second day of the mission None of the cameras that recorded the launch had a clear view of the debris striking the wing, leaving the group unable to determine the level of damage sustained by the orbiter The group's chair contacted Wayne Hale, the Shuttle Program Manager for Launch Integration, to request on-orbit pictures of Columbia's wing to assess its damage After receiving notification of the debris strike, engineers at NASA, United Space Alliance, and Boeing created the Debris Assessment Team and began working to determine the damage to the orbiter [5]: 140, 143  Intercenter Photo Working Group believed that the orbiter's RCC tiles were possibly damaged; NASA program managers were less concerned over the danger caused by the debris strike [5]: 141 \n\n\nReentry\nColumbia was scheduled to reenter the atmosphere and land on February 1, 2003 At 3:30 am EST the Entry Flight Control Team started

the crew member from depressurization None of the crew members had closed their visors, and one was not wearing a helmet; this would indicate that depressurization occurred quickly before they could

identify debris [17]: 93 \n\n\nColumbia Accident Investigation Board\nAbout ninety minutes after the disaster, NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe called to convene the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) to determine the cause [5]: 231  [33] It was chaired by retired U.S Navy Admiral Harold W Gehman, Jr and included military and civilian analysts It initially consisted of eight members, including Gehman, but expanded to 13 members by March The CAIB members were notified by noon on the day of the accident, and participated in a teleconference that evening The following day, they traveled to Barksdale AFB to begin the investigation The CAIB members first toured the debris fields, and then established their operations at JSC The CAIB established four teams to investigate NASA management and program safety, NASA training and crew operations, the technical aspects of the disaster, and how NASA culture affected the Space Shuttle program These groups collaborated, and hired other support staff to investigate [5]: 231–232  The CAIB worked alongside the reconstruction efforts to determine the cause of the accident, and interviewed members of the Space Shuttle program, including those who had been involved with STS-107 [5]: 234–235  The CAIB conducted public hearings from March until June, [5]: 237–238  and released its final report in August 2003 [5]: 2 \n\n\nCause of the accident\nAfter looking at sensor data, the CAIB considered damage to the left wing as a likely culprit for Columbia's destruction It investigated that recovered debris and noted the difference in heat damage between the two wings RCC panels from the left wing were found in the western portion of the debris field, indicating that it was shed first before the rest of the orbiter disintegrated [5]: 73–74  X-ray and chemical analysis was conducted on the RCC panels, revealing the highest levels of slag deposits to be in the left wing tiles [5]: 75–76  Impact testing was conducted at the Southwest Research Institute, using a nitrogen-powered gun to fire a projectile made of the same material as the ET bipod foam Panels taken from Enterprise,  Discovery, and Atlantis were used to determine the projectiles' effect on RCC panels [5]: 79–80  A test on RCC panel 8, taken from Atlantis, was the most consistent with the damage observed on Columbia, indicating it was the damaged panel that led to the in-flight breakup [5]: 82–83 \n\n\nOrganizational culture\nThe CAIB was critical of NASA organizational culture, and compared its current state to that of NASA leading up to the Challenger disaster [5]: 99  It concluded that NASA was experiencing budget constraints while still expecting to keep a high level of launches and operations [5]: 100  Program operating costs were lowered by 21% from 1991 to 1994, [5]: 107  despite a planned increase in the yearly flight rate for assembly of the International Space Station [5]: 114  Despite a history of foam strike events, NASA management did not consider the potential risk to the astronauts as a safety-of-flight issue [5]: 126  The CAIB found that a lack of a safety program led to the lack of concern over foam strikes [5]: 177  The board determined that NASA lacked the appropriate communication and integration channels to allow problems to be discussed and effectively routed and addressed [5]: 187  This risk was further compounded by pressure to adhere to a launch schedule for construction of the ISS [5]: 198 \n\n\nPossible emergency procedures\nIn its report, the CAIB discussed potential options that could have saved Columbia's crew [34] They determined that the mission could have been extended to at most 30 days (February 15), after which the lithium hydroxide canisters used to remove carbon dioxide would have run out [5]: 173  On STS-107, Columbia was carrying the Extended Duration Orbiter, which increased its supply of oxygen and hydrogen [35]: 398  To maximize the mission duration, non-essential systems would have been powered down, [35]: 399  and animals in the Spacehab module would have been euthanized [35]: 397 \n\n\nNASA response\nThe Space Shuttle program was suspended after the loss of Columbia [36] The further construction of the International Space Station (ISS) was delayed, as the Space Shuttle had been scheduled for seven missions to the ISS in 2003 and 2004 to complete its construction [37]\nTo prevent future foam strikes, the ET was redesigned to remove foam from the bipod Instead, electric heaters were installed to prevent ice building up in the bipod due to the cold liquid oxygen in its feedlines [38] Additional heaters were also installed along the liquid oxygen line, which ran from the base of the tank to its interstage section [39] NASA also improved its ground imaging capabilities at Kennedy Space Center to better observe and monitor potential issues that occur during launch The existing cameras at LC-39A, LC-39B, and along the coast were upgraded, and nine new camera sites were added Cameras were added to the bellies of Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavour (only Columbia and Challenger had them prior) to allow digital images of the ET to be viewed on the ground soon after launch The prior system on Columbia used film and could only be downlinked after the orbiter returned to Earth [38] The Orbiter Boom Sensor System, a camera on the end of the Canadarm, was added to allow the crew to inspect the orbiter for any tile damage once they reached orbit [40] [41] Each of the orbiter's wings was equipped with 22 temperature sensors to detect any breaches during reentry and with 66 accelerometers to detect an impact Post-landing inspection procedures were updated to include technicians examining the RCC panels using flash thermography [40]\n\n\nSpace Shuttle updates\nThe Space Shuttle program was suspended after the loss of Columbia [36] The further construction of the International Space Station (ISS) was delayed, as the Space Shuttle had been scheduled for seven missions to the ISS in 2003 and 2004 to complete its construction [37]\nTo prevent future foam strikes, the ET was redesigned to remove foam from the

inspection procedures were updated to include technicians examining the RCC panels using flash thermography [40]\n\n\nFirst Return to Flight mission (STS-114)\nThe first Return to Flight mission, STS-114, began with the launch of Discovery on July 26, 2005, at 10:39 am (EDT) [43] Sixteen pieces of foam from the ET were dislodged during the launch that were large enough to be considered significant by NASA investigators, [44]: 7  including one piece that was approximately 36 by 11 inches (91 by 28 cm) [44]: 18  Post-launch investigations did not find any indications of damage from the foam loss, but ET video did reveal that a small piece of TPS tile from the nose landing gear fell off during launch [45] Upon reaching orbit the crew inspected Discovery with the Orbiter Boom Sensor System On July 29 Discovery rendezvoused with the ISS and, before docking, performed the first rendezvous pitch maneuver to allow the crew aboard the ISS to observe and photograph the orbiter's belly [46] The next day, astronauts Soichi Noguchi and Stephen Robinson performed the first of three spacewalks They tested a tile repair tool, the Emittance Wash Applicator, on intentionally damaged TPS tiles that had been brought in the payload bay [47]: 62  On August 3 the same astronauts performed the third EVA of the mission, during which Robinson stood on the ISS's Canadarm2 and went to Discovery's belly to remove two gap fillers between tiles that had begun to protrude [47]: 63  [48] After a delay due to bad weather at KSC, the decision was made to land at Edwards AFB Discovery successfully landed at 8:11 am (EDT) on August 9 [43] [46] Had Discovery been unable to safely land, the crew would have remained on the ISS until Atlantis was flown to rescue them [49] As a result of the foam loss, NASA grounded the Space Shuttle fleet again [36] [45]\n\n\nSecond Return to Flight mission (STS-121)\nTo address the problem of foam loss for the second Return to Flight mission (STS-121), NASA engineers removed the foam ramp from the protuberance air load (PAL) on the ET, which was the source of the largest piece of debris on STS-114 [50] The launch was postponed from its scheduled launch of July 1, 2006, and again on July 2 due to inclement weather at KSC [51] On July 3 a piece of foam approximately 3 by .25 inches (7.62 by 0.64 cm) and weighing 0.0057 pounds (2.6 g) broke off from the ET [52] [53] The mission still launched as scheduled at 2:38 pm (EDT) on July 4 [54] After reaching orbit, Discovery performed post-launch inspections of its TPS and docked with the ISS on July 6 [51] The orbiter carried a 28 feet (8.5 m) remote control orbiter in-flight maintenance cable that could connect the flight deck systems to the avionics system in the mid-deck; it would allow the spacecraft to be landed remotely, to include controlling the landing gear and deploying the parachute [55] [56] On July 12 astronauts Piers Sellers and Michael Fossum performed an EVA to test the NonOxide Adhesive eXperiment (NOAX), which applied protective sealant to samples of damaged TPS tiles [47]: 70  Discovery undocked from the ISS on July 14 and safely landed at 9:14 am on July 17 at KSC [51] Had the crew been stranded in orbit, NASA planned to launch Atlantis to rescue them from the ISS [57] [58]\n\n\nProgram cancellation\nIn January 2004 President Bush announced the Vision for Space Exploration, calling for the Space Shuttle fleet to complete the ISS and be retired by 2010, to be replaced by a newly developed Crew Exploration Vehicle for travel to the Moon and Mars [59] In 2004, NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe canceled a planned servicing of the Hubble Space Telescope and decided that future missions would all rendezvous with the ISS to ensure the safety of the crew [60] In 2006, his successor, Michael Griffin, decided to have one more servicing mission to the telescope, STS-125, which flew in May 2009 [61] [62] The retirement of the Space Shuttle was delayed until 2011, [63] [64] after which no further crewed spacecraft were launched from the United States until 2020 when SpaceX's Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission successfully carried NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Robert Behnken to the ISS [65]\n\n\nLegacy\nOn February 4, 2003, President Bush and his wife Laura led a memorial service for the astronauts' families at the Johnson Space Center Two days later, Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife Lynne led a similar service at Washington National Cathedral Patti LaBelle sang \"Way Up There\" as part of the service [66] A memorial service was held at KSC on February 7; Robert Crippen, the first pilot of Columbia, gave a eulogy for the crew and a tribute for Columbia herself, acknowledging her achievements as the first orbiter and NASA's flagship, her role in trying desperately to save the crew on STS-107, and her many missions dedicated to scientific research [17]: 155  On October 28, 2003, the names of the crew were added to the Space Mirror Memorial at the KSC Visitor Complex in Merritt Island, Florida, alongside the names of 17 other astronauts and cosmonauts who have died in the line of duty [67] On February 2, 2004, NASA Administrator O'Keefe unveiled a memorial for the STS-107 crew at Arlington National Cemetery, and it is located near the Challenger memorial [68] A tree for each astronaut was planted in NASA's Astronaut Memorial Grove at the Johnson Space Center, along with trees for each astronaut from the Apollo 1 and Challenger disasters [69] The exhibit Forever Remembered at KSC Visitor Complex features the cockpit window frames from Columbia [70] In 2004, Bush conferred posthumous Congressional Space Medals of Honor to all 14 crew members killed in the Challenger and Columbia accidents [71]\n\n\nSee also\n32°57′22″N

However, in order to do so, she must be married, so she asks her high school friend Jung Yi-hyun, a former star baseball player but now a police detective, to enter into a contract marriage. The building is luxurious and highly stratified, with public rentals making up the first five floors, and those who own apartments for the upper ones.

together at SNL, where Schur worked as a writer [56] Signing Poehler, who was pregnant with her first child, meant the new series would have to forgo a promised post-Super Bowl debut and cut its first

{"title": "Hanfu", "content": "\nHistory\nHanfu comprises all traditional clothing classifications of the Han Chinese with a recorded history of more than three millennia [15] [16] Each succeeding dynasty produced their own distinctive dress codes, reflecting the socio-cultural environment of the times [17] [18] Clothing made of silk was initially used for decorative and ceremonial purposes The cultivation of silk, however, ushered the development of weaving, and by the time of the Han dynasty, brocade, damask, satin, and gauze had been developed [19] \n\nShang dynasty, 2nd millenium BCE\nIn China, a systemic structure of clothing was first developed during the Shang dynasty, where colours, designs, and rules governing use was implemented across the social strata [6] Only primary colours (i.e red, blue, and yellow) and green were used due to the degree of technology at the time [30]\n\n\nZhou dynasty, 1046 - 256 BCE\nFollowing the Shang dynasty, the Western Zhou dynasty established new system of etiquette and rites on clothing, placing new ceremonial, political and cultural significance on clothing This tied fashion to the rites and culture of its people, which became the basis for the Li (禮) orthodoxy of Confucianism that dominated East Asian culture for 2000 years In reference to this, Ruist writings such as Kong Yingda's \"True Meaning of Chunqiu- Zuo zhuan\" suggest that the term huaxia (華夏) referred to both the ceremonial etiquettes of the central states and the clothing that those states' denizens wore [38] [39] [40] [41]\n\n\nSpring and Autumn period, Warring States period\nDuring the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period, numerous schools of thought emerged in China, including Confucianism; those different schools of thoughts naturally influenced the development of the clothing [50] Moreover, due to the frequent wars occurring during the Warring States period, various etiquette were slowly revoked [53] Eastern Zhou dynasty dress code started to erode by the middle of Warring States period [35] Later, many regions decided not to follow the system of Zhou dynasty; the clothing during this period were differentiated among the seven major states (i.e the states of Chu, Han, Qin, Wei, Yan, Qi and Zhao) [6] [45]: 255–261  [53] Moreover, the year 307 B.C also marked an important year with the first reform of the military uniform implemented by King Wuling of Zhao This reform, commonly referred to as Hufuqishe, required all Zhao soldiers to wear the Hufu-style uniforms of the Donghu, Linhu and Loufan people in battle to facilitate fighting capability [32] [45]: 257  [54] The hedangku with a loose rise was then introduced [32] [34] [55]\n\n\nQin dynasty\nAlthough the Qin dynasty was short-lived, it set up a series of systems that impacted the later generations greatly Following the unification of the seven states, Emperor Qin Shihuang ordered his people, regardless of distance and class, to follow a series of regulations in all forms of cultural aspects, including clothing [45] The clothing style in Qin was therefore unitary [65] The Qin dynasty adopted a coloured-clothing system, which stipulated people who held higher position (officials of the third rank and above) wore green shenyi while common people wore normal white shenyi [66]: 183  [32] The Han Chinese wore the shenyi as a formal dress and was worn together with a guan and shoes [32]: 16  The Qin dynasty also abolished Zhou dynasty's mianfu ranking system,  replaced with a uniform type of black shenyi called junxuan(袀玄)     [後漢書 1] and tongtianguan instead of the mianguan for the emperor, [67] [68] with the officials following suit and wearing the same black robes [2]: 24  [66]: 183  In court, the officials wore hats, loose robes with carving knives hanging from the waist, holding hu, and stuck ink brush between head and ears [2]: 24  [66]: 183  There was an increase in the popularity of robes with large sleeves with cuff laces among men [2]: 24  [66]: 183 \n\n\nHan dynasty\n\nBy the time of Han dynasty, the shenyi remained popular and developed further into two types: qujupao and zhijupao [61]: 9–14  The robes appeared to be similar, regardless of gender, in cut and construction: a wrap closure, held by a belt or a sash, with large sleeves gathered in a narrower cuff; however, the fabric, colours and ornaments of the robes were different between gender [54] However, later during the Eastern Han, very few people wore shenyi [71]\n\nThree Kingdoms, Jin dynasty\nThe paofu worn in the Han dynasty continued to evolve During this period, 220–589 AD, the robe became loose on the wearer's body so a wide band functioned as belt was in use to organise the fitting, and the sleeves of the robe changed to \"wide-open\" instead of cinched at the wrist; this style is referred as bao yi bo dai, and usually worn with inner shirt and trousers [61] [29]: 312–330  [54] In some instances, the upper part of the robe was loose and open with no inner garment worn; men wearing this style of robe was featured in the painting Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove [29]: 312–330  The bao yi bo dai style appears to have been a northern Han Chinese style, and the popularity of the robe was a result of the widespread Taoism [29]: 312–330  [50] In the Jin dynasty, in particular, while many clothing of the Han dynasty were maintained, scholars and adherents of Neo-Taoism rejected the traditional court dress and retreated from the rigid Confucian system; this showed up in how they would dress themselves [80] The style of men's paofu gradually changed into a more simple and casual style, while the style of women's paofu increased in complexity [61] During the Three Kingdoms and Jin period, especially during the Eastern Jin period (317 – 420 AD), aristocratic women sought for a carefree life style after the collapse of the Eastern Han dynasty's ethical code; this kind of lifestyle influenced the development of women's clothing, which became more elaborate [61] Typical women attire during this period is the guiyi, a wide-sleeved paofu adorned with xian (髾; long swirling silk ribbons) and shao (襳; a type of triangular pieces of decorative embroidered-cloth) on the lower hem of the robe that hanged like banners and formed a \"layered effect\" [81] [61] [82] [83] The robe continued to be worn in the Northern and Southern dynasties by both men and women, as seen in the lacquered screen found in the Northern Wei tomb of Sima Jinlong (ca 483 A.D); however, there were some minor alterations to the robe, such as higher waistline and the sleeves are usually left open in a dramatic flare [54]\n\n\nSixteen Kingdoms, Northern and Southern dynasties\nDue to the frequent wars in this era, mass migration occurred and resulted in several ethnics living together with communication exchange; as such, this period marked an important time of cultural integration and cultural blending, including the cultural exchange of clothing [66]: 181–203  [86] Han Chinese living in the south favoured the driving dress of the northern minorities, trousers and xi (褶; a tight sleeved, close fitting long jacket, length reaching below crotch and above knees), while the rulers from northern minorities favoured the court dress of the Han Chinese [32] Near the areas of the Yellow River, the popularity of the ethnic minorities' hufu was high, almost equal to the Han Chinese clothing, in the Sixteen Kingdoms and the Northern and Southern dynasties period [45]\n\n\nSui, Tang, Five dynasties and Ten kingdoms period\nThe Sui and the Tang dynasties developed the pinsefu (品色服), which was a colour grading clothing system to differentiate social ranking; this colour grading system for clothing then continued to be developed in the subsequent dynasties [102] [103]\n\n\nSui dynasty\nFollowing the unification of China under the Sui dynasty, the Sui court abolished the Northern Zhou rituals and adopted the rituals, practices and ideas of the Han and Cao Wei dynasties, and the clothing code of the Han dynasty was restored [61] [97] The Sui system was also based on the system of Western Jin and Northern Qi [104] The first emperor of Sui, Emperor Gaozu, would wear tongtianfu on grand occasions, gunyi (衮衣; dragon robe) on suburban rites and visits to ancestral temple [104] He also set the colour red as the authoritative colour of the court imperial robes; this included the clothing of emperors and the ceremonial clothing of the princes [105] Crimson was the colour of martial clothing (i.e chamber guards, martial guards, generals and duke generals) whereas servants would wear purple clothing, which consisted of hood and loose trousers [105] During Emperor Gaozu's time, the court official garment was similar to the clothing attire of the commoners, except that it was yellow in colour [104] Court censors during Emperor Gaozu wore the quefeiguan [104]\n\n\nTang dynasty and Five dynasties and Ten kingdoms period\nMany elements of the Tang dynasty clothing traditions was inherited from the Sui dynasty [66]: 181–203  During the Tang dynasty, yellow-coloured robes and shirts were reserved for emperors; a tradition which was kept until the Qing dynasty [66]: 181–203  Moreover, the subjects of the Tang dynasty were forbidden from using ochre yellow colour as Emperor Gaozu used this colour for his informal clothing [66]: 181–203  [105] The guan was replaced by futou [32] Scholars and officials wore the futou along with the panling lanshan [108] Clothing colours and fabric materials continued to play a role in differentiating ranks; for example, officials of the three upper levels and princes had to wear purple robes; officials above the fifth level had to wear red robes; officials of the sixth and seventh level had to wear green robes; and officials of the eighth and ninth levels had to wear cyan robes [32] [66]: 181–203  Dragons-with-three-claws emblems also started to be depicted on the clothing of court officials above third ranks and on the clothing of princes; these dragon robes were first documented in 694 AD during the reign of Empress Wu Zetian [109]: 33  Common people wore white and soldiers wore black [32]\n\n\nSong dynasty\nThe Song dynasty clothing system was established at the beginning of the Northern Song dynasty Clothes could be classified into two major types: officials garments (further differentiated between court clothing and daily wear), and the garment for ordinary people [45] [135]: 1–7  Some features of Tang dynasty clothing were carried into the Song dynasty, such as court dress [136]\n\n\nLiao, Western Xia, and Jin dynasties\nThe rulers of the Liao dynasty adopted a clothing system which allowed the coexistence of Han Chinese and Khitan clothing [135]: 32–59  The Khitan court adopted both the guofu (國服; Khitan National garments) and hanfu, which the Khitan inherited from the Later Jin dynasty and were actually clothing from the Tang dynasty [132]: 15  [144] The guofu of the Liao dynasty was also heavily influenced by the Hanfu system [135]: 57 \n\n\nLiao dynasty\nThe rulers of the Liao dynasty adopted a clothing system which allowed the coexistence of Han Chinese and Khitan clothing [135]: 32–59  The Khitan court adopted both the guofu (國服; Khitan National garments) and hanfu, which the Khitan inherited from the Later Jin dynasty and were actually clothing from the Tang dynasty [132]: 15  [144] The guofu of the Liao dynasty was also heavily influenced by the Hanfu system [135]: 57 \n\n\nJin dynasty\nThe Jin dynasty rulers imitated the Song dynasty and decided to establish their own carriages and apparel system [135]: 32–59  In the early period of the Jin dynasty, the Jin dynasty court first attempted to impose Jurchen hairstyle and clothes on the Han Chinese population in 1126 AD and in 1129 AD [149]: 281  The Hanfu-style clothing was prohibited and the people had to wear a short scarf and left-lapelled clothing; if they did not obey, they were put to death [135]: 32–59  The Jurchen queue and shaving hairstyle was not enforced on the Han Chinese in the Jin after an initial attempt to do so which was a rebuke to Jurchen values [145] [150] However, the rules were not observed and the order was taken back under the Emperor Wanyan Liang who was Pro-Chinese allowing the Han Chinese to wear their Han clothing by lifting the ban in 1150 AD [149]: 281  After the occupation of the Northern Song territories by the Jurchens in 1127 AD, the Han Chinese who were living in Northern Song territories became the majority while the Jurchen became an ethnic minority; this led the Jurchens to make political concessions allowing the Han Chinese to practice Han Chinese culture [151] [147] In 1138 AD, the Jin court adopted the Chinese robes for the emperor and the officials [151]\n\n\nWestern Xia\nEmperor Jingzong, the first emperor of Western Xia, rejected Han Chinese silk clothing over the leather and wool clothing of the nomadic people from the Steppe; he argued that the Tanguts had traditionally worn leather-based and wool clothing and since the Tanguts men were military, they also had no use for silk materials [132]: 15  Yet, silk clothing was still worn in Western Xia during his reign [132]: 15  The Hanfu-style and the Tangut-style clothing were distinguished from each other, but both were used in the Western Xia [132]: 15  The Hanfu-style clothing was worn by officials whereas the Tangut-style clothing was worn by the military [132]: 15  Civil officials wore futou, boots, purple or crimson gown [135]: 32–59  Emperor Jingzong also ordered that every people in Western Xia must be shaved in an attempt to restore old Xianbei customs, and disobedience was death penalty [135]: 32–59  However, in 1061 AD, Emperor Yizong, the son of Emperor Jingzong, decided to replace Tangut clothing with Hanfu in his court [152] In his wish list to the Song dynasty court, Emperor Yizong asked permission to use Han Chinese rites and clothing to greet Song dynasty envoys and seek permission to buy Chinese official clothing; both of these requests were granted [152]\n\nYuan dynasty\nDuring the Yuan dynasty, Mongol dress was the clothing of elite for both genders [153] The Mongol attire for both men and women worn in the 13th-14th century was completely different from the Hanfu which had been worn in the Tang dynasty and Song dynasty [154] The Mongol attire was shared by people of different social ranking due to its practicality which contrasted with the dress code of the Han Chinese; as such, Mongol attire was popular [154] The Mongols never imposed Mongol customs on the Han Chinese [17]\n\n\nMing dynasty\nThe Ming dynasty had many Mongol clothes and cultural aspects abolished and enforced Tang dynasty style Han Chinese clothing [143]\n\n\nBan of hufu, return to hanfu, and cultural integration\nThe Ming dynasty had many Mongol clothes and cultural aspects abolished and enforced Tang dynasty style Han Chinese clothing [143]\n\n\nEstablishing new dress regulations\nThe founder of the Ming dynasty, the Hongwu Emperor, saw the fundamentality of making a new dress code to consolidate his rule; he spent almost all his reigning years developing and institutionalizing dressing regulations, which were recorded in various compilation of texts, such as the Collected Statutes of the Ming Dynasty [155] [156] The dressing regulations were based on the dressing system of the Tang and Song dynasties [155] [159] Moreover, the Ming dynasty dressing regulations were strongly related to the ritual system; the Confucian codes and ideals that were popularized during the Ming dynasty also had a significant effect on those regulations [162] The dressing regulations determined what attire and ornaments could be worn depending on one's social ranks [155] [156] [162] For example, the Ming dynasty's basic dressing principles, announced in 1392, included the following: [156]\n\n\nQing dynasty\nIn the Liao, Jin, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, Jurchen people mainly wore Zuojun gowns The robes and clothes of the Manchus before entering the customs are called \"yijie\" in Manchu They are clothes worn by men, women and children throughout the year Each gown is cut from a whole piece of clothing The basic structure is a round neck, a large flap, a left gusset, four-sided slits, a waistband and horseshoe sleeves [173]\n\n\nDevelopment of Qing imperial court clothing\nIn the Liao, Jin, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, Jurchen people mainly wore Zuojun gowns The robes and clothes of the Manchus before entering the customs are called \"yijie\" in Manchu They are clothes worn by men, women and children throughout the year Each gown is cut from a whole piece of clothing The basic structure is a round neck, a large flap, a left gusset, four-sided slits, a waistband and horseshoe sleeves [173]\n\n\nClothing reform by Qianlong\nThe Qing dynasty court continued to reform and regulate the clothing of its subjects, but discussion on ethnic clothing was a sensitive topic even after the Qing dynasty had consolidated its rule [143] By 1759 AD, the Qianlong Emperor commissioned the Illustrated Precedents for the Ritual Paraphernalia of the Imperial Court (Huangchao Liqi Tushi) which was published and enforced by 1766; this publication covered several aspects including the dressing and accessories of the emperors, princes, noblemen and their consorts, Manchu officials, their wives and daughters, and the dress codes for Han Chinese men officials who had reached the rank of mandarin and were employed and their wives; as well as Han Chinese men who were waiting for an official appointment [109]: 2–3  [165] The aim of this edict was made to preserve the Manchu identity once again, but at the same time, it also attempted to align the image of the emperor with Confucian ideas and codes of behaviours and manners [181] The dress code designed in the Huangchao Liqi Tushi continued to be used as the standard for the court attire until the end of the Qing dynasty [109]: 2–3  The Manchu continued to use the five colours symbolism in their clothing which was in line with the previous Han Chinese dynasties; however, they chose the colour blue as their dynasty colour and generally avoided the use of red colour in their clothing because red was the dynasty colour of Ming dynasty [165] On the other hand, Han Chinese continued to view red as a lucky colour because of its connection with rulers of Ming dynasty, and used it extensively in celebratory events and at weddings [165]\n\n\nBan of Chinese clothing and hairstyle\nWhen the Manchus established the Qing dynasty, the authorities issued decrees having Han Chinese men to adopt Manchu hairstyle by shaving their hair on the front of the head and braiding the hair on the back of the head into pigtails The resistances against the hair shaving policy were suppressed [182] Han Chinese did not object to wearing the queue braid on the back of the head as they traditionally wore all their hair long, but fiercely objected to shaving the forehead so the Qing government exclusively focused on forcing people to shave the forehead rather than wear the braid Han rebels in the first half of the Qing who objected to Qing hairstyle wore the braid but defied orders to shave the front of the head One person was executed for refusing to shave the front but he had willingly braided the back of his hair [183]\n\n\nTifayifu exemptions\nThe implementation of tifayifu policy, the early Qing dynasty court also prohibited Han Chinese from wearing some specific Manchu items and prohibited banner-women from dressing as Han Chinese women in order to maintain ethnic distinction [195] The early Qing dynasty policies also mainly applied to Han Chinese men [195] [191] Those who were exempted from such policies were women, children, Buddhist and Taoist monks, and Qing dynasty rebels; moreover, men in their living had to wear Manchu-clothing, but they could be buried in Hanfu after their death [195] [191] [196]\n\n\nRebellion and resistance to Qing\nHan Chinese rebels who went against the Qing dynasty, like the Taiping rebels, even retained their queue braids on the back but the symbol of their rebellion against the Qing was the growing of hair on the front of the head, causing the Qing government to view shaving the front of the head as the primary sign of loyalty to the Qing rather than wearing the braid on the back which did not violate Han customs and which traditional Han did not object to [196] [197] Koxinga insulted and criticized the Qing hairstyle by referring to the shaven pate looking like a fly [198]: 77  Koxinga and his men objected to shaving when the Qing demanded they shave in exchange for recognizing Koxinga as a feudatory [198]: 86 The Qing demanded that Zheng Jing and his men on Taiwan shave in order to receive recognition as a fiefdom His men and Ming prince Zhu Shugui fiercely objected to shaving [198]: 187 His men and the last Ming dynasty prince, Zhu Shugui (1617 – 1683 AD), fiercely objected to the shaving decree [198]: 187 \n\n\nTaoist and buddhist priests/monks\nNeither Taoist priests nor Buddhist monks were required to wear the queue by the Qing; they continued to wear their traditional hairstyles, completely shaved heads for Buddhist monks, and long hair in the traditional Chinese topknot for Taoist priests [191] [203] [204] [183]\n\n\nBurial practices\nAfter death, their hair could also be combed into a topknot similar to the ones worn by the Han Chinese in Ming; a practice which was observed by the Europeans; [201] men who were wealthy but held no official rank were allowed to be buried in a deep-blue silk shenyi which was edged with bright blue or white band [165] Men who were in mourning were also exempted; [191] however, since the mourners were not allowed to wear topknot in accordance to the Confucian rites, the men simply untied their queues and left their loose hair dishevelled [201] Women from wealthy families could also be buried in a variation of shenyi called the bai shou yi (lit \"longevity jacket\"), a deep blue or black ao with the character shou for longevity embroidered in gold all over the ao [165] The bai shou yi was worn with a white pleated skirt which was edged with blue satin; the skirt was embroidered with the many blue shou character [165]\n\n\nChinese opera and drama performers\nThe ban of Hanfu also did not apply to performers who wore and displayed Hanfu-style costumes when performing dramas [195]\n\n\nWomen's clothing\nFor women's clothing, Manchu and Han fashions of clothing coexisted [191] [6]: 7  The Han Chinese women carefully maintained their pure Han Chinese ethnicity and did not wear Manchu clothing [165] Throughout the Qing dynasty, Han women continued to wear clothing from Ming dynasty; however, with time, the Ming dynasty customs started to be forgotten and influence from the Manchu started to influence the women's clothing [165] [206] Yet, Manchu women and Han Chinese women never emulated each other's clothing;

Each succeeding dynasty produced distinctive dress codes that reflected the socio-cultural environment of the times. The cultivation of silk ushered the development of weaving, and by the time of the Han dynasty, brocade, damask, satin, and gauze had been developed.\n\n**History**\n\n### Shang Dynasty (2nd Millennium BCE)\n\nIn China, a systemic structure of clothing was first developed during the Shang dynasty, where colors, designs, and rules governing use were implemented across the social strata. Only primary colors (red, blue, and yellow) and green were used due to the degree of technology at the time.\n\n### Zhou Dynasty (1046-256 BCE)\n\nFollowing the Shang dynasty, the Western Zhou dynasty established new system of etiquette and rites on clothing, placing new ceremonial, political, and cultural significance on clothing. This tied fashion to the rites and culture of its people, which became the basis for the Li (礼) orthodoxy of Confucianism that dominated East Asian culture for 2000 years.\n\n### Spring and Autumn Period, Warring States Period\n\nDuring the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period, numerous schools of thought emerged in China, including Confucianism; those different schools of thoughts naturally influenced the development of the clothing. Moreover, due to the frequent wars occurring during the Warring States period, various etiquette were slowly revoked. Eastern Zhou dynasty dress code started to erode by the middle of Warring States period. Later, many regions decided not to follow the system of Zhou dynasty; the clothing during this period were differentiated among the seven major states (the states of Chu, Han, Qin, Wei, Yan, Qi, and Zhao).\n\n### Qin Dynasty\n\nAlthough the Qin dynasty was short-lived, it set up a series of systems that impacted the later generations greatly. Following the unification of the seven states, Emperor Qin Shihuang ordered his people, regardless of distance and class, to follow a series of regulations in all forms of cultural aspects, including clothing. The clothing style in Qin was therefore unitary. The Qin dynasty adopted a colored-clothing system, which stipulated people who held higher position (officials of the third rank and above) wore green shenyi while common people wore normal white shenyi.\n\n### Han Dynasty\n\nBy the time of Han dynasty, the shenyi remained popular and developed further into two types: qujupao and zhijupao. The robes appeared to be similar, regardless of gender, in cut and construction: a wrap closure, held by a belt or a sash, with large sleeves gathered in a narrower cuff; however, the fabric, colors, and ornaments of the robes were different between gender. However, later during the Eastern Han, very few people wore shenyi.\n\n### Three Kingdoms, Jin Dynasty\n\nThe paofu worn in the Han dynasty continued to evolve. During this period, 220-589 AD, the robe became loose on the wearer's body so a wide band functioned as belt was in use to organize the fitting, and the sleeves of the robe changed to \"wide-open\" instead of cinched at the wrist; this style is referred as bao yi bo dai, and usually worn with inner shirt and trousers. In some instances, the upper part of the robe was loose and open with no inner garment worn; men wearing this style of robe was featured in the painting Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove.\n\n### Sui, Tang, Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period\n\nThe Sui and the Tang dynasties developed the pinsefu, which was a color grading clothing system to differentiate social ranking; this color grading system for clothing then continued to be developed in the subsequent dynasties.\n\n### Song Dynasty\n\nThe Song dynasty clothing system was established at the beginning of the Northern Song dynasty. Clothes could be classified into two major types: officials garments (further differentiated between court clothing and daily wear), and the garment for ordinary people. Some features of Tang dynasty clothing were carried into the Song dynasty, such as court dress.\n\n### Liao, Western Xia, and Jin Dynasties\n\nThe rulers of the Liao dynasty adopted a clothing system which allowed the coexistence of Han Chinese and Khitan clothing. The Khitan court adopted both the guofu (國服; Khitan National garments) and hanfu, which the Khitan inherited from the Later Jin dynasty and were actually clothing from the Tang dynasty.\n\n### Ming Dynasty\n\nThe Ming dynasty had many Mongol clothes and cultural aspects abolished and enforced Tang dynasty style Han Chinese clothing. The founder of the Ming dynasty, the Hongwu Emperor, saw the fundamentality of making a new dress code to consolidate his rule; he spent almost all his reigning years developing and institutionalizing dressing regulations, which were recorded in various compilation of texts, such as the Collected Statutes of the Ming Dynasty.\n\n### Qing Dynasty\n\nIn the Liao, Jin, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, Jurchen people mainly wore Zuojun gowns. The robes and clothes of the Manchus before entering the customs are called \"yijie\" in Manchu. They are clothes worn by men, women, and children throughout the year. Each gown is cut from a whole piece of clothing. The basic structure is a round neck, a large flap, a left gusset, four-sided slits, a waistband, and horseshoe sleeves.\n\n### Ban of Hanfu\n\nWhen the Manchus established the Qing dynasty, the authorities issued decrees having Han Chinese men to adopt Manchu hairstyle by shaving their hair on the front of the head and braiding the hair on the back of the head into pigtails. Han Chinese did not object to wearing the queue braid on the back of the head as they traditionally wore all their hair long, but fiercely objected to shaving the forehead so the Qing government exclusively focused on forcing people to shave the front of the head.\n\n### Tifayifu Exemptions\n\nThe implementation of tifayifu policy, the early Qing dynasty court also prohibited Han Chinese from wearing some specific Manchu items and prohibited banner-women from dressing as Han Chinese women in order to maintain ethnic distinction.\n\n### Rebellion and Resistance to Qing\n\nHan Chinese rebels who went against the Qing dynasty, like the Taiping rebels, even retained their queue braids on the back but the symbol of their rebellion against the Qing was the growing of hair on the front of the head, causing the Qing government to view shaving the front of the head as the primary sign of loyalty to the Qing rather than wearing the braid on the back which did not violate Han customs and which traditional Han did not object to.\n\n### Taoist and Buddhist Priests/Monks\n\nNeither Taoist priests nor Buddhist monks were required to wear the queue by the Qing; they continued to wear their traditional hairstyles, completely shaved heads for Buddhist monks, and long hair in the traditional Chinese topknot for Taoist priests.\n\n### Burial Practices\n\nAfter death, their hair could also be combed into a topknot similar to the ones worn by the Han Chinese in Ming; a practice which was observed by the Europeans. Men who were wealthy but held no official rank were allowed to be buried in a deep-blue silk shenyi which was edged with bright blue or white band. Men who were in mourning were also exempted; however, since the mourners were not allowed to wear topknot in accordance to the Confucian rites, the men simply untied their queues and left their loose hair disheveled.\n\n### Chinese Opera and Drama Performers\n\nThe ban of Hanfu did not apply to performers who wore and displayed Hanfu-style costumes when performing dramas.\n\n### Women's Clothing\n\nFor women's clothing, Manchu and Han fashions of clothing coexisted. The Han Chinese women carefully maintained their pure Han Chinese ethnicity and did not wear Manchu clothing. Throughout the Qing dynasty, Han women continued to wear clothing from Ming dynasty; however, with time, the Ming dynasty customs started to be forgotten and influence from the Manchu started to influence the women's clothing.\n\n### Children\n\nInfants would wear dudou, which was embroidered with luck charms, as their only clothing in hot summer months until they reach the age of two to three years old. Han Chinese children were spared from the tifayifu policy and could be dressed in Hanfu; their clothing was fastened to the right side in the Ming dynasty-style. Their daily clothing was made of silk, and they would wear satin and silk clothing for special occasions; the colors of the clothing were brights and the clothing were typically red and pink as these were auspicious colors.\n\n**Modern Hanfu**\n\nIn the 21st century, hanfu has become a fashion trend and lucrative business sector. Entering the 21st century, hanfu has become a fashion trend and lucrative business sector. In 2018, it was estimated that the hanfu market consisted of 2 million potential consumers. The estimated revenue sales for 2019 was 1.4 billion yuan (US$199.3 million). According to the iiMedia 2018 survey, women make up 88.2% of the hanfu enthusiasts and 75.8% of the hanfu stores on Taobao and Tmall platforms only sell hanfu for women.\n\n**Modern Hanfu Characteristics and Design**\n\nThe 21st century hanfu is still referred as hanfu within the Hanfu cultural community for ease of expression. On March 8, 2021, the magazine Vogue published an article on modern hanfu defining it as a \"type of dress from any era when Han Chinese ruled\" and reported that the styles based on the Tang, Song, Ming periods were the most popular. Most modern hanfu are based on sculptures, paintings, art objects, historical records, and historical clothing.\n\nThe style of historical Han clothing can be summarized as containing garment elements that are arranged in distinctive and sometimes specific ways. A complete set of garment is assembled from several pieces of clothing into an attire.

the clothing during this period were differentiated among the seven major states (i.e the states of Chu, Han, Qin, Wei, Yan, Qi and Zhao) [6] [45]: 255–261  [53] Moreover, the year 307 B.C also marked an important year with the first reform of the military uniform implemented by King Wuling of Zhao This reform, commonly referred to as Hufuqishe, required all Zhao soldiers to wear the Hufu-style uniforms of the Donghu, Linhu and Loufan people in battle to facilitate fighting capability [32] [45]: 257  [54] The hedangku with a loose rise was then introduced [32] [34] [55]\n\n\nQin dynasty\nAlthough the Qin dynasty was short-lived, it set up a series of systems that impacted the later generations greatly Following the unification of the seven states, Emperor Qin Shihuang ordered his people, regardless of distance and class, to follow a series of regulations in all forms of cultural aspects, including clothing [45] The clothing style in Qin was therefore unitary [65] The Qin dynasty adopted a coloured-clothing system, which stipulated people who held higher position (officials of the third rank and above) wore green shenyi while common people wore normal white shenyi [66]: 183  [32] The Han Chinese wore the shenyi as a formal dress and was worn together with a guan and shoes [32]: 16  The Qin dynasty also abolished Zhou dynasty's mianfu ranking system,  replaced with a uniform type of black shenyi called junxuan(袀玄)     [後漢書 1] and tongtianguan instead of the mianguan for the emperor, [67] [68] with the officials following suit and wearing the same black robes [2]: 24  [66]: 183  In court, the officials wore hats, loose robes with carving knives hanging from the waist, holding hu, and stuck ink brush between head and ears [2]: 24  [66]: 183  There was an increase in the popularity of robes with large sleeves with cuff laces among men [2]: 24  [66]: 183 \n\n\nHan dynasty\n\nBy the time of Han dynasty, the shenyi remained popular and developed further into two types: qujupao and zhijupao [61]: 9–14  The robes appeared to be similar, regardless of gender, in cut and construction: a wrap closure, held by a belt or a sash, with large sleeves gathered in a narrower cuff; however, the fabric, colours and ornaments of the robes were different between gender [54] However, later during the Eastern Han, very few people wore shenyi [71]\n\nThree Kingdoms, Jin dynasty\nThe paofu worn in the Han dynasty continued to evolve During this period, 220–589 AD, the robe became loose on the wearer's body so a wide band functioned as belt was in use to organise the fitting, and the sleeves of the robe changed to \"wide-open\" instead of cinched at the wrist; this style is referred as bao yi bo dai, and usually worn with inner shirt and trousers [61] [29]: 312–330  [54] In some instances, the upper part of the robe was loose and open with no inner garment worn; men wearing this style of robe was featured in the painting Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove [29]: 312–330  The bao yi bo dai style appears to have been a northern Han Chinese style, and the popularity of the robe was a result of the widespread Taoism [29]: 312–330  [50] In the Jin dynasty, in particular, while many clothing of the Han dynasty were maintained, scholars and adherents of Neo-Taoism rejected the traditional court dress and retreated from the rigid Confucian system; this showed up in how they would dress themselves [80] The style of men's paofu gradually changed into a more simple and casual style, while the style of women's paofu increased in complexity [61] During the Three Kingdoms and Jin period, especially during the Eastern Jin period (317 – 420 AD), aristocratic women sought for a carefree life style after the collapse of the Eastern Han dynasty's ethical code; this kind of lifestyle influenced the development of women's clothing, which became more elaborate [61] Typical women attire during this period is the guiyi, a wide-sleeved paofu adorned with xian (髾; long swirling silk ribbons) and shao (襳; a type of triangular pieces of decorative embroidered-cloth) on the lower hem of the robe that hanged like banners and formed a \"layered effect\" [81] [61] [82] [83] The robe continued to be worn in the Northern and Southern dynasties by both men and women, as seen in the lacquered screen found in the Northern Wei tomb of Sima Jinlong (ca 483 A.D); however, there were some minor alterations to the robe, such as higher waistline and the sleeves are usually left open in a dramatic flare [54]\n\n\nSixteen Kingdoms, Northern and Southern dynasties\nDue to the frequent wars in this era, mass migration occurred and resulted in several ethnics living together with communication exchange; as such, this period marked an important time of cultural integration and cultural blending, including the cultural exchange of clothing [66]: 181–203  [86] Han Chinese living in the south favoured the driving dress of the northern minorities, trousers and xi (褶; a tight sleeved, close fitting long jacket, length reaching below crotch and above knees), while the rulers from northern minorities favoured the court dress of the Han Chinese [32] Near the areas of the Yellow River, the popularity of the ethnic minorities' hufu was high, almost equal to the Han Chinese clothing, in the Sixteen Kingdoms and the Northern and Southern dynasties period [45]\n\n\nSui, Tang, Five dynasties and Ten kingdoms period\nThe Sui and the Tang dynasties developed the pinsefu (品色服), which was a colour grading clothing system to differentiate social ranking; this colour grading system for clothing then continued to be developed in the subsequent dynasties [102] [103]\n\n\nSui dynasty\nFollowing the unification of China under the Sui dynasty, the Sui court abolished the Northern Zhou rituals and adopted the rituals, practices and ideas of the Han and Cao Wei dynasties, and the clothing code of the Han dynasty was restored [61] [97] The Sui system was also based on the system of Western Jin and Northern Qi [104] The first emperor of Sui, Emperor Gaozu, would wear tongtianfu on grand occasions, gunyi (衮衣; dragon robe) on suburban rites and visits to ancestral temple [104] He also set the colour red as the authoritative colour of the court imperial robes; this included the clothing of emperors and the ceremonial clothing of the princes [105] Crimson was the colour of martial clothing (i.e chamber guards, martial guards, generals and duke generals) whereas servants would wear purple clothing, which consisted of hood and loose trousers [105] During Emperor Gaozu's time, the court official garment was similar to the clothing attire of the commoners, except that it was yellow in colour [104] Court censors during Emperor Gaozu wore the quefeiguan [104]\n\n\nTang dynasty and Five dynasties and Ten kingdoms period\nMany elements of the Tang dynasty clothing traditions was inherited from the Sui dynasty [66]: 181–203  During the Tang dynasty, yellow-coloured robes and shirts were reserved for emperors; a tradition which was kept until the Qing dynasty [66]: 181–203  Moreover, the subjects of the Tang dynasty were forbidden from using ochre yellow colour as Emperor Gaozu used this colour for his informal clothing [66]: 181–203  [105] The guan was replaced by futou [32] Scholars and officials wore the futou along with the panling lanshan [108] Clothing colours and fabric materials continued to play a role in differentiating ranks; for example, officials of the three upper levels and princes had to wear purple robes; officials above the fifth level had to wear red robes; officials of the sixth and seventh level had to wear green robes; and officials of the eighth and ninth levels had to wear cyan robes [32] [66]: 181–203  Dragons-with-three-claws emblems also started to be depicted on the clothing of court officials above third ranks and on the clothing of princes; these dragon robes were first documented in 694 AD during the reign of Empress Wu Zetian [109]: 33  Common people wore white and soldiers wore black [32]\n\n\nSong dynasty\nThe Song dynasty clothing system was established at the beginning of the Northern Song dynasty Clothes could be classified into two major types: officials garments (further differentiated between court clothing and daily wear), and the garment for ordinary people [45] [135]: 1–7  Some features of Tang dynasty clothing were carried into the Song dynasty, such as court dress [136]\n\n\nLiao, Western Xia, and Jin dynasties\nThe rulers of the Liao dynasty adopted a clothing system which allowed the coexistence of Han Chinese and Khitan clothing [135]: 32–59  The Khitan court adopted both the guofu (國服; Khitan National garments) and hanfu, which the Khitan inherited from the Later Jin dynasty and were actually clothing from the Tang dynasty [132]: 15  [144] The guofu of the Liao dynasty was also heavily influenced by the Hanfu system [135]: 57 \n\n\nLiao dynasty\nThe rulers of the Liao dynasty adopted a clothing system which allowed the coexistence of Han Chinese and Khitan clothing [135]: 32–59  The Khitan court adopted both the guofu (國服; Khitan National garments) and hanfu, which the Khitan inherited from the Later Jin dynasty and were actually clothing from the Tang dynasty [132]: 15  [144] The guofu of the Liao dynasty was also heavily influenced by the Hanfu system [135]: 57 \n\n\nJin dynasty\nThe Jin dynasty rulers imitated the Song dynasty and decided to establish their own carriages and apparel system [135]: 32–59  In the early period of the Jin dynasty, the Jin dynasty court first attempted to impose Jurchen hairstyle and clothes on the Han Chinese population in 1126 AD and in 1129 AD [149]: 281  The Hanfu-style clothing was prohibited and the people had to wear a short scarf and left-lapelled clothing; if they did not obey, they were put to death [135]: 32–59  The Jurchen queue and shaving hairstyle was not enforced on the Han Chinese in the Jin after an initial attempt to do so which was a rebuke to Jurchen values [145] [150] However, the rules were not observed and the order was taken back under the Emperor Wanyan Liang who was Pro-Chinese allowing the Han Chinese to wear their Han clothing by lifting the ban in 1150 AD [149]: 281  After the occupation of the Northern Song territories by the Jurchens in 1127 AD, the Han Chinese who were living in Northern Song territories became the majority while the Jurchen became an ethnic minority; this led the Jurchens to make political concessions allowing the Han Chinese to practice Han Chinese culture [151] [147] In 1138 AD, the Jin court adopted the Chinese robes for the emperor and the officials [151]\n\n\nWestern Xia\nEmperor Jingzong, the first emperor of Western Xia, rejected Han Chinese silk clothing over the leather and wool clothing of the nomadic people from the Steppe; he argued that the Tanguts had traditionally worn leather-based and wool clothing and since the Tanguts men were military, they also had no use for silk materials [132]: 15  Yet, silk clothing was still worn in Western Xia during his reign [132]: 15  The Hanfu-style and the Tangut-style clothing were distinguished from each other, but both were used in the Western Xia [132]: 15  The Hanfu-style clothing was worn by officials whereas the Tangut-style clothing was worn by the military [132]: 15  Civil officials wore futou, boots, purple or crimson gown [135]: 32–59  Emperor Jingzong also ordered that every people in Western Xia must be shaved in an attempt to restore old Xianbei customs, and disobedience was death penalty [135]: 32–59  However, in 1061 AD, Emperor Yizong, the son of Emperor Jingzong, decided to replace Tangut clothing with Hanfu in his court [152] In his wish list to the Song dynasty court, Emperor Yizong asked permission to use Han Chinese rites and clothing to greet Song dynasty envoys and seek permission to buy Chinese official clothing; both of these requests were granted [152]\n\nYuan dynasty\nDuring the Yuan dynasty, Mongol dress was the clothing of elite for both genders [153] The Mongol attire for both men and women worn in the 13th-14th century was completely different from the Hanfu which had been worn in the Tang dynasty and Song dynasty [154] The Mongol attire was shared by people of different social ranking due to its practicality which contrasted with the dress code of the Han Chinese; as such, Mongol attire was popular [154] The Mongols never imposed Mongol customs on the Han Chinese [17]\n\n\nMing dynasty\nThe Ming dynasty had many Mongol clothes and cultural aspects abolished and enforced Tang dynasty style Han Chinese clothing [143]\n\n\nBan of hufu, return to hanfu, and cultural integration\nThe Ming dynasty had many Mongol clothes and cultural aspects abolished and enforced Tang dynasty style Han Chinese clothing [143]\n\n\nEstablishing new dress regulations\nThe founder of the Ming dynasty, the Hongwu Emperor, saw the fundamentality of making a new dress code to consolidate his rule; he spent almost all his reigning years developing and institutionalizing dressing regulations, which were recorded in various compilation of texts, such as the Collected Statutes of the Ming Dynasty [155] [156] The dressing regulations were based on the dressing system of the Tang and Song dynasties [155] [159] Moreover, the Ming dynasty dressing regulations were strongly related to the ritual system; the Confucian codes and ideals that were popularized during the Ming dynasty also had a significant effect on those regulations [162] The dressing regulations determined what attire and ornaments could be worn depending on one's social ranks [155] [156] [162] For example, the Ming dynasty's basic dressing principles, announced in 1392, included the following: [156]\n\n\nQing dynasty\nIn the Liao, Jin, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, Jurchen people mainly wore Zuojun gowns The robes and clothes of the Manchus before entering the customs are called \"yijie\" in Manchu They are clothes worn by men, women and children throughout the year Each gown is cut from a whole piece of clothing The basic structure is a round neck, a large flap, a left gusset, four-sided slits, a waistband and horseshoe sleeves [173]\n\n\nDevelopment of Qing imperial court clothing\nIn the Liao, Jin, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, Jurchen people mainly wore Zuojun gowns The robes and clothes of the Manchus before entering the customs are called \"yijie\" in Manchu They are clothes worn by men, women and children throughout the year Each gown is cut from a whole piece of clothing The basic structure is a round neck, a large flap, a left gusset, four-sided slits, a waistband and horseshoe sleeves [173]\n\n\nClothing reform by Qianlong\nThe Qing dynasty court continued to reform and regulate the clothing of its subjects, but discussion on ethnic clothing was a sensitive topic even after the Qing dynasty had consolidated its rule [143] By 1759 AD, the Qianlong Emperor commissioned the Illustrated Precedents for the Ritual Paraphernalia of the Imperial Court (Huangchao Liqi Tushi) which was published and enforced by 1766; this publication covered several aspects including the dressing and accessories of the emperors, princes, noblemen and their consorts, Manchu officials, their wives and daughters, and the dress codes for Han Chinese men officials who had reached the rank of mandarin and were employed and their wives; as well as Han Chinese men who were waiting for an official appointment [109]: 2–3  [165] The aim of this edict was made to preserve the Manchu identity once again, but at the same time, it also attempted to align the image of the emperor with Confucian ideas and codes of behaviours and manners [181] The dress code designed in the Huangchao Liqi Tushi continued to be used as the standard for the court attire until the end of the Qing dynasty [109]: 2–3  The Manchu continued to use the five colours symbolism in their clothing which was in line with the previous Han Chinese dynasties; however, they chose the colour blue as their dynasty colour and generally avoided the use of red colour in their clothing because red was the dynasty colour of Ming dynasty [165] On the other hand, Han Chinese continued to view red as a lucky colour because of its connection with rulers of Ming dynasty, and used it extensively in celebratory events and at weddings [165]\n\n\nBan of Chinese clothing and hairstyle\nWhen the Manchus established the Qing dynasty, the authorities issued decrees having Han Chinese men to adopt Manchu hairstyle by shaving their hair on the front of the head and braiding the hair on the back of the head into pigtails The resistances against the hair shaving policy were suppressed [182] Han Chinese did not object to wearing the queue braid on the back of the head as they traditionally wore all their hair long, but fiercely objected to shaving the forehead so the Qing government exclusively focused on forcing people to shave the forehead rather than wear the braid Han rebels in the first half of the Qing who objected to Qing hairstyle wore the braid but defied orders to shave the front of the head One person was executed for refusing to shave the front but he had willingly braided the back of his hair [183]\n\n\nTifayifu exemptions\nThe implementation of tifayifu policy, the early Qing dynasty court also prohibited Han Chinese from wearing some specific Manchu items and prohibited banner-women from dressing as Han Chinese women in order to maintain ethnic distinction [195] The early Qing dynasty policies also mainly applied to Han Chinese men [195] [191] Those who were exempted from such policies were women, children, Buddhist and Taoist monks, and Qing dynasty rebels; moreover, men in their living had to wear Manchu-clothing, but they could be buried in Hanfu after their death [195] [191] [196]\n\n\nRebellion and resistance to Qing\nHan Chinese rebels who went against the Qing dynasty, like the Taiping rebels, even retained their queue braids on the back but the symbol of their rebellion against the Qing was the growing of hair on the front of the head, causing the Qing government to view shaving the front of the head as the primary sign of loyalty to the Qing rather than wearing the braid on the back which did not violate Han customs and which traditional Han did not object to [196] [197] Koxinga insulted and criticized the Qing hairstyle by referring to the shaven pate looking like a fly [198]: 77  Koxinga and his men objected to shaving when the Qing demanded they shave in exchange for recognizing Koxinga as a feudatory [198]: 86 The Qing demanded that Zheng Jing and his men on Taiwan shave in order to receive recognition as a fiefdom His men and Ming prince Zhu Shugui fiercely objected to shaving [198]: 187 His men and the last Ming dynasty prince, Zhu Shugui (1617 – 1683 AD), fiercely objected to the shaving decree [198]: 187 \n\n\nTaoist and buddhist priests/monks\nNeither Taoist priests nor Buddhist monks were required to wear the queue by the Qing; they continued to wear their traditional hairstyles, completely shaved heads for Buddhist monks, and long hair in the traditional Chinese topknot for Taoist priests [191] [203] [204] [183]\n\n\nBurial practices\nAfter death, their hair could also be combed into a topknot similar to the ones worn by the Han Chinese in Ming; a practice which was observed by the Europeans; [201] men who were wealthy but held no official rank were allowed to be buried in a deep-blue silk shenyi which was edged with bright blue or white band [165] Men who were in mourning were also exempted; [191] however, since the mourners were not allowed to wear topknot in accordance to the Confucian rites, the men simply untied their queues and left their loose hair dishevelled [201] Women from wealthy families could also be buried in a variation of shenyi called the bai shou yi (lit \"longevity jacket\"), a deep blue or black ao with the character shou for longevity embroidered in gold all over the ao [165] The bai shou yi was worn with a white pleated skirt which was edged with blue satin; the skirt was embroidered with the many blue shou character [165]\n\n\nChinese opera and drama performers\nThe ban of Hanfu also did not apply to performers who wore and displayed Hanfu-style costumes when performing dramas [195]\n\n\nWomen's clothing\nFor women's clothing, Manchu and Han fashions of clothing coexisted [191] [6]: 7  The Han Chinese women carefully maintained their pure Han Chinese ethnicity and did not wear Manchu clothing [165] Throughout the Qing dynasty, Han women continued to wear clothing from Ming dynasty; however, with time, the Ming dynasty customs started to be forgotten and influence from the Manchu started to influence the women's clothing [165] [206] Yet, Manchu women and Han Chinese women never emulated each other's clothing; and as a result, by the end of the nineteenth century, Manchu and Han Chinese women had maintained distinctive clothing [191]\n\n\nChildren\nInfants would wear dudou, which was embroidered with luck charms, as their only clothing in hot summer months until they reach the age of two to three years old [165] Han Chinese children were spared from the tifayifu policy and could be dressed in Hanfu; [195] their clothing was fastened to the right side in the Ming dynasty-style [165] Their daily clothing was made of silk, and they would wear satin and silk clothing for special occasions; the colours of the clothing were brights and the clothing were typically red and pink as these were auspicious colours [165]\n\n\n20th century\nIn 1912, the republic was established and government ministers were required to western-style clothing [165] Official attire for both men and women were regulated and published in the government gazettes; the men had to wear western-style clothing on formal days and evening, and in informal time, they could Western suit or changshan magua Women had to wear Qing style aoqun [165] Women started to wear more western-style clothing, Foot binding was legally abolished [165]\n\n\nHanfu in popular media and opera (20th century – present)\nSince the 20th century, hanfu and hanfu-style clothing has been used frequently as ancient costumes in Chinese and foreign television series, films and other forms of entertainment media, and was widely popularized since the late 1980s dramas [23] [215] [24] [216] One example of historically inaccurate hanfu-style costume is the costume worn by Disney's Mulan, where the wide sleeves of the hanfu were reduced to narrow sleeves reflecting modern fashion and to reflect the character of Disney's Mulan [216]\n\n\nHanfu in modern Taoism (20th century – present)\nModern Taoist monks and Taoism practitioners continue to style their long hair into a touji (頭髻; a topknot hairstyle) and wear traditional clothing [223] [224] [225] [226] Some modern taoist abbess and priests also wear cross-collared jiaoling youren robes and hats [227] [228]\n\n\n21st century\nThe Hanfu Movement is an ongoing social movement which aims at popularizing hanfu and integrating traditional Chinese elements into the design of modern clothing, as a way to promote traditional Chinese culture.\n\n\nHanfu Movement\nThe Hanfu Movement is an ongoing social movement which aims at popularizing hanfu and integrating traditional Chinese elements into the design of modern clothing, as a way to promote traditional Chinese culture.\n\n\nGrowing popularity and market trend\nEntering the 21st century, hanfu has become a fashion trend and lucrative business sector In 2018, it was estimated that the hanfu market consisted of 2 million potential consumers [1] The estimated revenue sales for 2019 was 1.4 billion yuan (US$199.3 million) [1] According to the iiMedia 2018 survey, women make up 88.2% of the hanfu enthusiasts and 75.8% of the hanfu stores on Taobao and Tmall platforms only sell hanfu for women [1]\n\n\nModern hanfu\nThe 21st century hanfu is still referred as hanfu within the Hanfu cultural community for ease of expression [18] On March 8, 2021, the magazine Vogue published an article on modern hanfu defining it as a \"type of dress from any era when Han Chinese ruled\" and reported that the styles based on the Tang, Song, Ming periods were the most popular [231]\n\n\nCharacteristics and design\nMost modern hanfu are based on sculptures, paintings, art objects, historical records, and historical clothing.Ming dynasty Han Chinese robes given by the Ming Emperors to the Chinese noble Dukes Yansheng descended from Confucius are still preserved in the Confucius Mansion after over five centuries Robes from the Qing emperors are also preserved there [234] [235] [236] [237] The Jurchens in the Jin dynasty and Mongols in the Yuan dynasty continued to patronize and support the Confucian Duke Yansheng [238] Around the year 2007 or 2008, a group of young people from Minghang district, Shanghai, started a project to restore Chinese clothing from ancient dynasties based on rigorous research, spending their days reading ancient documents and looking at paintings to find detailed information about the styles, materials, colours and patterns used in ancient times; this group is called the Ancient Chinese Clothing Restoration Team Archived 15 April 2021 at the Wayback Machine [239]\n\n\nGarments\nThe style of historical Han clothing can be summarized as containing garment elements that are arranged in distinctive and sometimes specific ways A complete set of garment is assembled from several pieces of clothing into an attire:\n\n\nFootwear\nThere were many etiquettes which rule people's daily lives, and this included the use and etiquettes of shoes and socks wearing [245] The rules of Zhou stipulated that shoes had to be removed before entering a house; shoes and socks had to be removed at banquets, and ministers who had to meet with the emperor had to remove both their shoes and socks [245] Being barefoot was considered a taboo on ceremonial worship occasions [245]\n\n\nHeadwear and hairstyles\nOn top of the garments, hats (for men) or hairpieces (for women) may be worn One can often tell the profession or social rank of someone by what they wear on their heads The typical types of male headwear are called jin (巾) for soft caps, mao (帽) for stiff hats and guan for formal headdress Officials and academics have a separate set of hats, typically the putou, the wushamao, the si-fang pingding jin (四方平定巾; or simply, fangjin: 方巾) and the Zhuangzi jin (莊子巾) A typical hairpiece for women is the hairpin called ji (笄) that appeared since Neolithic time, and there are more elaborate hairpieces.\n\n\nAccessories\nHanfu also consists of many forms of accessories, such as jewelry, waist ornaments, ribbons, shawls, scarves, and other hand-held items.\n\n\nInfluences and derivatives\nThis References is written in Chinese If it is intended for readers from the Chinese language community, it should be contributed to the Chinese Wikipedia See the list of Wikipedias Please see this article's entry on Pages needing translation into English for discussion If the References is not rewritten in English within the next two weeks it will be listed for deletion and/or moved to the Chinese Wikipedia.\n\n\nGallery\nThis References is written in Chinese If it is intended for readers from the Chinese language community, it should be contributed to the Chinese Wikipedia See the list of Wikipedias Please see this article's entry on Pages needing translation into English for discussion If the References is not rewritten in English within the next two weeks it will be listed for deletion and/or moved to the Chinese Wikipedia.\n\n\nSee also\nThis References is written in Chinese If it is intended for readers from the Chinese language community, it should be contributed to the Chinese Wikipedia See the list of Wikipedias Please see this article's entry on Pages needing translation into English for discussion If the References is not rewritten in English within the next two weeks it will be listed for deletion and/or moved to the Chinese Wikipedia.\n\n\nSub-categories of hanfu\nThis References is written in Chinese If it is intended for readers from the Chinese language community, it should be contributed to the Chinese Wikipedia See the list of Wikipedias Please see this article's entry on Pages needing translation into English for discussion If the References is not rewritten in English within the next two weeks it will be listed for deletion and/or moved to the Chinese Wikipedia.\n\n\nTraditional Chinese clothing and culture\nThis References is written in Chinese If it is intended for readers from the Chinese language community, it should be contributed to the Chinese Wikipedia See the list of Wikipedias Please see this article's entry on Pages needing translation into English for discussion If the References is not rewritten in English within the next two weeks it will be listed for deletion and/or moved to the Chinese Wikipedia.\n\n\nNotes\nThis References is written in Chinese If it is intended for readers from the Chinese language community, it should be contributed to the Chinese Wikipedia See the list of Wikipedias Please see this article's entry on Pages needing translation into English for discussion If the References is not rewritten in English within the next two weeks it will be listed for deletion and/or moved to the Chinese Wikipedia.\n\n\nReferences\nThis References is written in Chinese If it is intended for readers from the Chinese language community, it should be contributed to the Chinese Wikipedia See the list of Wikipedias Please see this article's entry on Pages needing translation into English for discussion If the References is not rewritten in English within the next two weeks it will be listed for deletion and/or moved to the Chinese Wikipedia.\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on June 7, 1991, in Westminster, London, she rose to fame in the early 2010s with her striking appearance and captivating performances on screen.\n\n# Early Life\n\nRatajkowski was born to American parents, John David \"J.D.\" Ratajkowski and Kathleen Anne Balgley, who were both school teachers. Her father is of Polish descent, and her mother is Jewish. Ratajkowski has stated that she ethnically identifies as \"Polish-Israeli,\" as her ancestors made aliyah to Israel from Central Europe. She also has Irish ancestry.\n\nRatajkowski spent her early years in the San Diego suburb of Encinitas, California. Her family would often vacation in Bantry, County Cork, Ireland, where she developed a strong connection to the region. She attended San Dieguito Academy, a high school in Encinitas, while pursuing modeling and acting opportunities in Los Angeles.\n\n# Career\n\nRatajkowski's modeling career began when she was just 14 years old. She was discovered by a talent agent who contacted Ford Models, and she signed with the agency at the age of 14. She went on to model for teen print catalogs, including Kohl's and Nordstrom. At 15, she began auditioning for Disney and Nickelodeon roles, but she was often typecast as a bully or cheerleader.\n\nAfter two non-descript movie roles, Ratajkowski landed the role of Gibby's girlfriend, Tasha, in two episodes of the third season of Nickelodeon's iCarly (2009-2010). Her manager discouraged her from pursuing many acting engagements until she could be more selective.\n\n# Breakthrough and Rise to Prominence\n\nRatajkowski's breakthrough role came in 2013 when she appeared in the music video for Robin Thicke's song \"Blurred Lines.\" The video garnered her notoriety, especially as a sex symbol. In October 2013, Esquire magazine named Ratajkowski \"Woman of the Year,\" over online fan vote finalist Jennifer Lawrence. That December, Rolling Stone magazine listed her among its twenty hottest sex symbols.\n\nIn February 2014, Sports Illustrated magazine named Ratajkowski as one of twelve 50th-anniversary swimsuit issue rookies.

AskMen ranked her the third most desirable woman of 2014.\n\n# Professional Expansion\n\nRatajkowski's performance in the 2014 adaptation of Gillian Flynn's novel Gone Girl, directed by David Fincher, showcased her acting abilities. She played the role of Andie, the mistress of Ben Affleck's character. The San Diego Union-Tribune described Ratajkowski's performance as \"nuanced,\" while Andrew O'Hehir of Salon and Wesley Morris of Grantland wrote that her small role was critical.\n\n# In the Media\n\nRatajkowski has been frequently named in lists and polls that rank beauty or fashion in the media. She was ranked in Maxim's Hot 100 list in both 2014 (No. 62) and 2015 (No. 2). AskMen ranked her among its most desirable women of 2014 (No. 3) and 2016 (No. 14). FHM ranked her among the sexiest in 2014 (No. 4) and 2015 (No. 18).\n\nRatajkowski is also praised for her fashion sense. She made Vogue Italia's Best Dressed List of 2015, and Harper's Bazaar placed her atop its best-dressed list at the February 2016 New York Fashion Week.\n\n# Publishing Controversies\n\nRatajkowski was one of the victims of the 2014 celebrity nude photo leak, in which several nude pictures of her were leaked online.\n\n# Fyre Festival Controversy\n\nIn 2017, Ratajkowski promoted the Fyre Festival on Instagram with Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid, and other actresses and models. Ratajkowski was reportedly the only actress or model to use the hashtag #ad, but later deleted the post. The Federal Trade Commission has said #ad only worked if at the beginning of paid posts, and that the hashtag alone was not a sufficient disclaimer.\n\nA second class-action lawsuit against Fyre Media, McFarland, Ja Rule, and the event promoters in Los Angeles was filed. The plaintiff alleges that they deceived patrons into attending the festival by paying over 400 social media personalities and celebrities to promote it. The parties are accused of breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and fraud.\n\n# Political Views\n\nRatajkowski has raised funds for several charitable causes, including reproductive and sexual health for Planned Parenthood. She has also done public service announcements and committed to a short film promoting reproductive and sexual health.\n\n# Activism\n\nRatajkowski has raised funds, done public service announcements, and committed to a short film promoting reproductive and sexual health for Planned Parenthood.\n\n# Sexuality and Feminism\n\nRatajkowski has spoken out about the pressure she endured as a youth around her sexuality and her thoughts on female sexual empowerment. In Lena Dunham's Lenny Letter newsletter, she wrote about the societal catch-22, in which showcasing female sexuality that may \"offend, excite, or create envy\" leads to criticism and body shaming.\n\n# Personal Life\n\nIn December 2014, Us Weekly confirmed that Ratajkowski had begun dating musician Jeff Magid. By early 2018, they had reportedly broken up.\n\n# Filmography\n\n* Gone Girl (2014)\n* Entourage (2015)\n* We Are Your Friends (2015)\n* I Feel Pretty (2018)\n* Welcome Home (2020)\n\n# Television\n\n* iCarly (2009-2010)\n* Law & Order (2011)\n* New Girl (2012)\n* Parks and Recreation (2013)\n* The Spoils Before Dying (2015)\n\n# Music Videos\n\n* \"Blurred Lines\" by Robin Thicke (2013)\n* \"Love in the Dark\" by David Guetta (2014)\n* \"GDFR\" by Flo Rida (2015)\n* \"We Found Love\" by R3HAB (2017)\n\n# Written Works\n\n* My Body (2020)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Emily_Ratajkowski\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nEmily O'Hara Ratajkowski was born June 7, 1991 [6] in Westminster, London, the only child of American school teachers Kathleen Anne Balgley and John David \"J.D.\" Ratajkowski [11] [12] [13] She was raised in the San Diego suburb of Encinitas, California She attended UCLA for a year before dropping out to model full-time [14] Her father was raised Roman Catholic, whereas her mother is Jewish [11] Ratajkowski has stated that she ethnically identifies herself as \"Polish-Israeli\", [5] as her ancestors made aliyah to Israel from Central Europe [15] [a] She also has Irish ancestry [16] She also spent her summers during her youth in Bantry, Co.Cork where the family holidayed [17]\n\n\nCareer\nWith encouragement from an acting coach, Ratajkowski met and signed with a talent agent who contacted Ford Models [21] That same day, [22] she signed with Ford at age 14 and went on to do teen print catalog modeling for Kohl's and Nordstrom [13] At 15, Ratajkowski began auditioning for Disney and iCarly roles, [22] but she was often typecast as a bully or cheerleader and bigger roles did not materialize [13] [23] She attended San Dieguito Academy, a high school in Encinitas, while modeling and acting in Los Angeles [23] After two nondescript movie roles, she appeared as Gibby's girlfriend, Tasha, in two episodes of the third season of Nickelodeon's iCarly (2009–2010) [4] [24] Her manager discouraged her from pursuing many acting engagements until she could be more selective [13] [23]\n\n\nEarly acting and music video performances\nWith encouragement from an acting coach, Ratajkowski met and signed with a talent agent who contacted Ford Models [21] That same day, [22] she signed with Ford at age 14 and went on to do teen print catalog modeling for Kohl's and Nordstrom [13] At 15, Ratajkowski began auditioning for Disney and iCarly roles, [22] but she was often typecast as a bully or cheerleader and bigger roles did not materialize [13] [23] She attended San Dieguito Academy, a high school in Encinitas, while modeling and acting in Los Angeles [23] After two nondescript movie roles, she appeared as Gibby's girlfriend, Tasha, in two episodes of the third season of Nickelodeon's iCarly (2009–2010) [4] [24] Her manager discouraged her from pursuing many acting engagements until she could be more selective [13] [23]\n\n\nBreakthrough and rise to prominence\nThe \"Blurred Lines\" video garnered Ratajkowski notoriety, [27] especially as a sex symbol [70] In October 2013, Esquire magazine named Ratajkowski \"Woman of the Year\", over online fan vote finalist Jennifer Lawrence [71] That December, Rolling Stone magazine listed her among its twenty hottest sex symbols [70] In February 2014, Sports Illustrated magazine named Ratajkowski as one of twelve 50th anniversary swimsuit issue rookies [72] In April, FHM ranked her the fourth sexiest woman in the world [73] Maxim magazine included Ratajkowski at number 62 on its 2014 Hot 100 list [74] [75] AskMen ranked her the third most desirable woman of 2014 [76]\n\n\nProfessional expansion\nAfter seeing her in the \"Blurred Lines\" video  Ben Affleck picked her to play the mistress of his character, in David Fincher's 2014 adaptation of Gillian Flynn's novel Gone Girl [141] The San Diego Union-Tribune described Ratajkowski's performance as \"nuanced\", [57] while Andrew O'Hehir of Salon and Wesley Morris of Grantland wrote that her small role as a \"duplicitous and manipulative former student\" was critical [142] [143] Reflecting on the performance in 2016, Naomi Wolf described Ratajkowski's portrayal as sympathetic and compassionate [22]\n\n\nIn the media\nRatajkowski has been frequently named in lists and polls that rank beauty or fashion in the media She was ranked in Maxim's Hot 100 list in both 2014 (No. 62) [74] and 2015 (No. 2) [216] AskMen ranked her among its most desirable women of 2014 (No. 3) [76] and 2016 (No. 14);

He was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole, but was acquitted and released in 2000 after an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nRaphael George Rowe was born in South-East London to a British mother, Rosemary Prior, and a father, Raphael Sr, who had emigrated from Jamaica at the age of 26. His mother was 17 when she married his father, and they had three daughters before Raphael Jr was born in 1968.\n\nGrowing up in a close-knit family, Rowe's parents instilled in him a strong sense of right and wrong from an early age. His father, a hard worker, encouraged Rowe to pursue his education and develop a strong work ethic. Rowe's mother, a kind and caring person, taught him the importance of empathy and compassion.\n\nRowe's early life was marked by a sense of security and stability, which would later be disrupted by the events of 1988. Despite the challenges he would face, Rowe's family remained a source of support and comfort throughout his ordeal.\n\n**Convictions**\n\nIn the early hours of December 16, 1988, three masked men, one carrying a knife, another a gun, beat and tied up Peter Hurburgh and Alan Eley, who were having sex in a car parked in a field. During the attack, Hurburgh died of a heart attack. Later that morning, the three men committed two home robberies and stabbed one of the occupants, 40-year-old Timothy Napier.\n\nRowe and his co-defendants, Davis and Johnson, were arrested on December 19, 1988, and January 6, 1989, respectively. They were dubbed the M25 Three by the media, due to the locations of the crimes. The victims stated that there were two white perpetrators and one black, but all three defendants were black. The victims also described an attacker with blue eyes and fair hair, which matched none of the three accused.\n\nThe investigation that followed was marred by errors and withheld evidence. Rowe's girlfriend at the time of the attack, Kate Williamson, testified against him at trial, but later admitted to and apologized for lying. The key prosecution witness, Norman Duncan, was a known criminal with previous convictions and had become a police informant prior to the trial.\n\nIn March 1990, the three were sentenced to life imprisonment without parole at the Old Bailey for murder and aggravated robbery.\n\n**Appeal and Release**\n\nIn 1994, Davis and Rowe made an application to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). Along with errors and other evidence withheld before the trial, it had not been disclosed to Rowe's lawyers that the key prosecution witness, Norman Duncan, was a known criminal with previous convictions, and prior to the trial had become a police informant.\n\nOn February 16, 2000, the ECtHR returned their judgment and found that there had been a violation of Article 6 (1) of the ECtHR, the right to a fair trial. In 1999, the Criminal Cases Review Commission referred the M25 Three case back to the Court of Appeal, and on July 17, 2000, Rowe and his co-defendants were acquitted and released.\n\nRowe has always maintained his innocence and has said that he believes the police conspired with witnesses.\n\n**Career**\n\nDuring his incarceration, Rowe studied journalism through a correspondence course. After his release, he joined the BBC in early 2001 as a reporter for BBC Radio 4.
