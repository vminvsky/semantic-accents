{"title": "Doctor_Who", "content": "\nPremise\nDoctor Who follows the adventures of the title character, a rogue Time Lord with somewhat unknown origins who goes by the name \"the Doctor\" The Doctor fled Gallifrey, the planet of the Time Lords, in a stolen TARDIS (\"Time and Relative Dimension(s) in Space\"), a time machine that travels by materialising into, and dematerialising out of, the time vortex The TARDIS has a vast interior but appears smaller on the outside, and is equipped with a \"chameleon circuit\" intended to make the machine take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise Because of a malfunction, the Doctor's TARDIS remains fixed as a blue British police box [6]\n\n\nHistory\nDoctor Who was originally intended to appeal to a family audience [10] as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history The programme first appeared on the BBC Television Service at 17:16:20 GMT on 23 November 1963; this was eighty seconds later than the scheduled programme time, because of announcements concerning the previous day's assassination of John F Kennedy [11] [12] It was to be a regular weekly programme, each episode 25 minutes of transmission length Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year The head of drama Sydney Newman was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) Donald Wilson and staff writer C E Webber; in a 1971 interview Wilson claimed to have named the series, and when this claim was put to Newman he did not dispute it [13] Writer Anthony Coburn, story editor David Whitaker and initial producer Verity Lambert also heavily contributed to the development of the series [14] [g]\n\n\nPublic consciousness\nIt has been claimed that the transmission of the first episode was delayed by ten minutes due to extended news coverage of the assassination of US President John F Kennedy the previous day; in fact, it went out after a delay of eighty seconds [38] The BBC believed that coverage of the assassination, as well as a series of power blackouts across the country, had caused many viewers to miss this introduction to a new series, and it was broadcast again on 30 November 1963, just before episode two [39] [40]\n\n\nEpisodes\nDoctor Who originally ran for 26 seasons on BBC One, from 23 November 1963 until 6 December 1989 During the original run, each weekly episode formed part of a story (or \"serial\")—usually of four to six parts in earlier years and three to four in later years [citation needed] Some notable exceptions were: The Daleks' Master Plan, which aired twelve episodes (plus an earlier one-episode teaser, [76] \"Mission to the Unknown\", featuring none of the regular cast [77]); almost an entire season of seven-episode serials (season 7); the ten-episode serial The War Games; [78] and The Trial of a Time Lord, which ran for fourteen episodes (albeit divided into three production codes and four narrative segments) during season 23 [79] Occasionally, serials were loosely connected by a story line, such as season 8 focusing on the Doctor battling a rogue Time Lord called the Master, [80] [81] season 16's quest for the Key to Time, [82] season 18's journey through E-Space and the theme of entropy, [83] and season 20's Black Guardian trilogy [84]\n\n\nMissing episodes\nBetween 1967 and 1978, large amounts of older material stored in the BBC's various video tape and film libraries was either destroyed [h] or wiped This included many early episodes of Doctor Who, those stories featuring the first two Doctors: William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton In all, 97 of 253 episodes produced during the programme's first six years are not held in the BBC's archives (most notably seasons 3, 4, and 5, from which 79 episodes are missing) [99] [100] In 1972, almost all episodes then made were known to exist at the BBC, [101] while by 1978 the practice of wiping tapes and destroying \"spare\" film copies had been brought to a stop [102]\n\n\nCharacters\nThe Doctor was initially shrouded in mystery In the programme's early days, the character was an eccentric alien traveller of great intelligence who battled injustice while exploring time and space in an unreliable time machine, the \"TARDIS\" (an acronym for Time and Relative Dimension in Space), which notably appears much larger on the inside than on the outside [i] [113]\n\n\nThe Doctor\nThe Doctor was initially shrouded in mystery In the programme's early days, the character was an eccentric alien traveller of great intelligence who battled injustice while exploring time and space in an unreliable time machine, the \"TARDIS\" (an acronym for Time and Relative Dimension in Space), which notably appears much larger on the inside than on the outside [i] [113]\n\n\nChanges of appearance\nProducers introduced the concept of regeneration to permit the recasting of the main character This was prompted by the poor health of the original star, William Hartnell [116] [117] The term \"regeneration\" was not conceived until the Doctor's third on-screen regeneration; Hartnell's Doctor merely described undergoing a \"renewal\", and the Second Doctor underwent a \"change of appearance\" [118] [119] The device has allowed for the recasting of the actor various times in the show's history, as well as the depiction of alternative Doctors either from the Doctor's relative past or future [120]\n\n\nMeetings of different incarnations\nThere have been instances of actors returning later to reprise their specific Doctor's role In 1973's The Three Doctors, William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee For 1983's \"The Five Doctors\", Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted Shada serial For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's The Two Doctors with Colin Baker [138]\n\n\nCompanions\nThe companion figure – generally a human – has been a constant feature in Doctor Who since the programme's inception in 1963 One of the roles of the companion is to be a reminder for the Doctor's \"moral duty\" [149] The Doctor's first companions seen on-screen were his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford) and her teachers Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) and Ian Chesterton (William Russell) These characters were intended to act as audience surrogates, through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor, who was to act as a mysterious father figure [149] The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is \"The Deadly Assassin\" (1976) [150] Notable companions from the earlier series include Romana (Mary Tamm and Lalla Ward), a Time Lady; Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen); and Jo Grant (Katy Manning) [151] [152] Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; [153] sometimes they return home or find new causes—or loves—on worlds they have visited Some have died during the course of the series [154] Companions are usually humans or humanoid aliens [153]\n\n\nFoes\nWhen Sydney Newman commissioned the series, he specifically did not want to perpetuate the cliché of the \"bug-eyed monster\" of science fiction [168] However, monsters were popular with audiences and so became a staple of Doctor Who almost from the beginning [169] Daleks, Cybermen, and the Master are some of the most iconic foes the Doctor has battled in the series [9]\n\n\nDaleks\nThe Daleks, which first appeared in the show's second serial in 1963, [173] [174] are Doctor Who's oldest villains The Daleks are Kaleds from the planet Skaro, mutated by the scientist Davros and housed in mechanical armour shells for mobility The actual creatures resemble octopuses with large, pronounced brains Their armour shells have a single eye-stalk, a sink-plunger-like device that serves the purpose of a hand, and a directed-energy weapon Their main weakness is their eyestalk;  attacks upon them using various weapons can blind a Dalek, making it go mad Their chief role in the series plot, as they frequently remark in their instantly recognisable metallic voices, is to \"exterminate\" all non-Dalek beings They even attack the Time Lords in the Time War, as shown during the 50th Anniversary of the show They continue to be a recurring 'monster' within the Doctor Who franchise, having appeared in every series since 2005 [175] Davros has also been a recurring figure since his debut in Genesis of the Daleks, although played by several different actors [176]\n\n\nCybermen\nCybermen were originally a wholly organic species of humanoids originating on Earth's twin planet Mondas that began to implant more and more artificial parts into their bodies This led to the race becoming coldly logical and calculating cyborgs, with emotions usually only shown when naked aggression was called for With the demise of Mondas, they acquired Telos as their new home planet They continue to be a recurring 'monster' within the Doctor Who franchise [182] [183]\n\n\nThe Master\nThe Master is the Doctor's archenemy, a renegade Time Lord who desires to rule the universe Conceived as \"Professor Moriarty to the Doctor's Sherlock Holmes\", [187] the character first appeared in 1971 As with the Doctor, the role has been portrayed by several actors, since the Master is a Time Lord as well and able to regenerate; the first of these actors was Roger Delgado, who continued in the role until his death in 1973 The Master was briefly played by Peter Pratt and Geoffrey Beevers until Anthony Ainley took over and continued to play the character until Doctor Who's hiatus in 1989 [188] The Master returned in the 1996 television movie of Doctor Who, and was played by American actor Eric Roberts [189]\n\n\nMusic\nThe Doctor Who theme music was one of the first electronic music signature tunes for television, and after more than a half century remains one of the most easily recognised The original theme was composed by Ron Grainer and realised by Delia Derbyshire of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, with assistance from Dick Mills, and was released as a single on Decca F 11837 in 1964 The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of season 17 (1979–1980) It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of analogue tape containing recordings of a single plucked string, white noise, and the simple harmonic waveforms of test-tone oscillators, intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music New techniques were invented to allow mixing of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines On hearing the finished result, Grainer asked, \"Jeez, Delia, did I write that?\" She answered, \"Most of it.\" [194] Although Grainer was willing to give Derbyshire the co-composer credit, it was against BBC policy at the time She would not receive an on-screen credit until the 50th-anniversary story \"The Day of the Doctor\" in 2013 [195] [196]\n\n\nTheme music\nThe Doctor Who theme music was

[196]\n\n\nIncidental music\nMost of the innovative incidental music for Doctor Who has been specially commissioned from freelance composers, although in the early years some episodes also used stock music, as well as occasional excerpts from original recordings or cover versions of songs by popular music acts such as The Beatles and The Beach Boys Since its 2005 return, the series has featured occasional use of excerpts of pop music from the 1970s to the 2000s [citation needed]\n\n\nViewership\nPremiering the day after the assassination of John F Kennedy, the first episode of Doctor Who was repeated with the second episode the following week [214] [215] Doctor Who has always appeared initially on the BBC's mainstream BBC One channel, where it is regarded as a family show, drawing audiences of many millions of viewers; [216] [217] The programme's popularity has waxed and waned over the decades, with three notable periods of high ratings [218] The first of these was the \"Dalekmania\" period (c. 1964–1965), when the popularity of the Daleks regularly brought Doctor Who ratings of between 9 and 14 million, even for stories which did not feature them [218] The second was the mid to late 1970s, when Tom Baker occasionally drew audiences of over 12 million [218]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nPremiering the day after the assassination of John F Kennedy, the first episode of

broadcast in 94 countries and screened to more than half a million people in cinemas across Australia, Latin America, North America and Europe The scope of the broadcast was a world record, according to Guinness World Records [227]\n\n\nOceania\nNew Zealand was the first country outside the United Kingdom to screen Doctor Who, beginning in September 1964, and continued to screen the series for many years, including the new revived series that aired on Prime Television from 2005 to 2017 [231] In 2018, the series is aired on Fridays on TVNZ 2, and on TVNZ On Demand on the same episode as the UK [232] The series moved to TVNZ 1 in 2021, [citation needed] before TVNZ lost the rights to the show altogether in 2022 [233]\n\n\nAmericas\nThe series also has a fan base in the United States, where it was shown in syndication from the 1970s to the 1990s, particularly on PBS stations [235]\n\n\nAsia\nSeries 1 through 3 of Doctor Who were broadcast on various NHK channels from 2006 to 2008 with Japanese subtitles [242] Beginning on 2 August 2009, upon the launch of Disney XD in Japan, the series has been broadcast with Japanese dubbing [243]\n\n\nHome media\nA wide selection of serials

[246]\n\n\nAdaptations and other appearances\nThere are two Dr Who feature films: Dr Who and the Daleks, released in 1965 and Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D in 1966 Both are retellings of existing television stories (specifically, the first two Dalek serials, The Daleks and The Dalek Invasion of Earth respectively) with a larger budget and alterations to the series concept [citation needed]\n\n\nFilms\nThere are two Dr Who feature films: Dr Who and the Daleks, released in 1965 and Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D in 1966 Both are retellings of existing television stories (specifically, the first two Dalek serials, The Daleks and The Dalek Invasion of Earth respectively) with a larger budget and alterations to the series concept [citation needed]\n\n\nSpin-offs\nDoctor Who has appeared on stage numerous times In the early 1970s, Trevor Martin played the role in Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday In the late 1980s, Jon Pertwee and Colin Baker both played the Doctor at different times during the run of a play titled Doctor Who – The Ultimate Adventure For two performances, while Pertwee was ill, David Banks (better known for playing Cybermen) played the Doctor Other original plays have been staged as amateur productions, with other actors playing the Doctor, while Terry Nation wrote The Curse of the Daleks, a stage play mounted in the late 1960s, but without the Doctor [citation needed]\n\n\nAftershows\nWhen the revived series of Doctor Who was brought back, an aftershow series was created by the BBC, titled Doctor Who Confidential There have been three aftershow series created, with the latest one titled Doctor Who: The Fan Show, which began airing from the tenth series Each series follows behind-the-scenes footage on the making of Doctor Who through clips and interviews with the cast, production crew and other people, including those who have participated in the television series in some manner Each episode deals with a different topic, and in most cases refers to the Doctor Who episode that preceded it [citation needed]\n\n\nCharity episodes and appearances\nIn 1983, coinciding with the series' 20th anniversary, \"The Five Doctors\" was shown as part of the annual BBC Children in Need Appeal, however it was not a charity-based production, simply scheduled within the line-up of Friday 25 November 1983 This was the programme's first co-production with Australian broadcaster ABC [283] At 90 minutes long it was the longest single episode of Doctor Who produced to date It featured three of the first five Doctors, a new actor to replace the deceased William Hartnell, and unused footage to represent Tom Baker [284]\n\n\nSpoofs and cultural references\nDoctor Who has been satirised and spoofed on many occasions by comedians including Spike Milligan (a Dalek invades his bathroom—Milligan, naked, hurls a soap sponge at it) and Lenny Henry Jon Culshaw frequently impersonates the Fourth Doctor in the BBC Dead Ringers series [292] Doctor Who fandom has also been lampooned on programs such as Saturday Night Live, The Chaser's War on Everything, Mystery Science Theater 3000, Family Guy, American Dad!, Futurama, South Park,\nCommunity as Inspector Spacetime, The Simpsons and The Big Bang Theory [citation needed] As part of the 50th-anniversary programmes, former Fifth Doctor Peter Davison directed, wrote, and co-starred in the parody The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot, which also starred two other former Doctors, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy, and had cameo appearances from cast and crew involved in the programme, including showrunner Steven Moffat and Doctors Paul McGann, David Tennant, and Matt Smith [293]\n\n\nAudio\nThe earliest Doctor Who–related audio release was a 21-minute narrated abridgement of the First Doctor television story The Chase released in 1966  Ten years later, the first original Doctor Who audio was released on LP record; Doctor Who and the Pescatons featuring the Fourth Doctor [303] The first commercially available audiobook was an abridged reading of the Fourth Doctor story State of Decay in 1981 In 1988, during a hiatus in the television show, Slipback, the first radio drama, was transmitted [304]\n\n\nBooks\nDoctor Who books have been published from the mid-sixties through to the present day From 1965 to 1991 the books published were primarily novelised adaptations of broadcast episodes; beginning in 1991 an extensive line of original fiction was launched, the Virgin New Adventures and Virgin Missing Adventures Since the relaunch of the programme in 2005, a new range of novels has been published by BBC Books Numerous non-fiction books about the series, including guidebooks and critical studies, have also been published, [citation needed] and a dedicated Doctor Who Magazine (DWM) with newsstand circulation has been published regularly since 1979: DWM is recognised by Guinness World Records as the longest running TV tie-in magazine, celebrating 40 years of continuous publication on 11 October 2019 [315] This is published by Panini, as is the Doctor Who Adventures magazine for younger fans [316]\n\n\nVideo games\nNumerous Doctor Who video games have been created from the mid-80s through to the present day A Doctor Who game was planned for the Sega Mega Drive but never released [317] One of the recent ones is a match-3 game released in November 2013 for iOS, Android, Amazon App Store and Facebook called Doctor Who: Legacy It has been constantly updated since its release and features all the Doctors as playable characters as well as over 100 companions [318]\n\n\nChronology and canonicity\nSince the creation of the Doctor Who character by BBC Television in the early 1960s, a myriad of stories have been published about Doctor Who, in different media: apart from the actual television episodes that continue to be produced by the BBC, there have also been novels, comics, short stories, audio books, radio plays, interactive video games, game books, webcasts, DVD extras, and stage performances The BBC takes no position on the canonicity of any of such stories, and producers of the show have expressed distaste for the idea of canonicity [325]\n\n\nAwards\nThe show has received recognition as one of Britain's finest television programmes, winning the 2006 British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series and five consecutive (2005–2010) awards at the National Television Awards during Russell T Davies' tenure as executive producer [326] [327] In 2011, Matt Smith became the first Doctor to be nominated for a BAFTA Television Award for Best Actor, [328] and in 2016, Michelle Gomez became the first woman to receive a BAFTA nomination for the series,

program produced by the BBC. The show has been on the air since 1963 and has become a beloved and iconic part of British popular culture. The program follows the adventures of a Time Lord, known as \"the Doctor,\" who travels through time and space in a time machine called the TARDIS. The show has been broadcast in over 50 countries and has gained a significant following worldwide.\n\n**Premise**\n\nThe show's premise is that the Doctor is a rogue Time Lord who flees his home planet of Gallifrey in a stolen TARDIS. The TARDIS is a time machine that appears smaller on the outside than it is on the inside, and is equipped with a \"chameleon circuit\" that is intended to make the machine take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise. However, the circuit malfunctions, and the TARDIS remains fixed as a blue British police box.\n\n**History**\n\nDoctor Who was originally intended to appeal to a family audience as an educational program using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history.

Every fully extant serial has been released on VHS, and BBC Worldwide continues to regularly release serials on DVD.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Doctor_Who\" following this outline:\n\n\nPremise\nDoctor Who follows the adventures of the title character, a rogue Time Lord with somewhat unknown origins who goes by the name \"the Doctor\" The Doctor fled Gallifrey, the planet of the Time Lords, in a stolen TARDIS (\"Time and Relative Dimension(s) in Space\"), a time machine that travels by materialising into, and dematerialising out of, the time vortex The TARDIS has a vast interior but appears smaller on the outside, and is equipped with a \"chameleon circuit\" intended to make the machine take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise Because of a malfunction, the Doctor's TARDIS remains fixed as a blue British police box [6]\n\n\nHistory\nDoctor Who was originally intended to appeal to a family audience [10] as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history The programme first appeared on the BBC Television Service at 17:16:20 GMT on 23 November 1963; this was eighty seconds later than the scheduled programme time, because of announcements concerning the previous day's assassination of John F Kennedy [11] [12] It was to be a regular weekly programme, each episode 25 minutes of transmission length Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year The head of drama Sydney Newman was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) Donald Wilson and staff writer C E Webber; in a 1971 interview Wilson claimed to have named the series, and when this claim was put to Newman he did not dispute it [13] Writer Anthony Coburn, story editor David Whitaker and initial producer Verity Lambert also heavily contributed to the development of the series [14] [g]\n\n\nPublic consciousness\nIt has been claimed that the transmission of the first episode was delayed by ten minutes due to extended news coverage of the assassination of US President John F Kennedy the previous day; in fact, it went out after a delay of eighty seconds [38] The BBC believed that coverage of the assassination, as well as a series of power blackouts across the country, had caused many viewers to miss this introduction to a new series, and it was broadcast again on 30 November 1963, just before episode two [39] [40]\n\n\nEpisodes\nDoctor Who originally ran for 26 seasons on BBC One, from 23 November 1963 until 6 December 1989 During the original run, each weekly episode formed part of a story (or \"serial\")—usually of four to six parts in earlier years and three to four in later years [citation needed] Some notable exceptions were: The Daleks' Master Plan, which aired twelve episodes (plus an earlier one-episode teaser, [76] \"Mission to the Unknown\", featuring none of the regular cast [77]); almost an entire season of seven-episode serials (season 7); the ten-episode serial The War Games; [78] and The Trial of a Time Lord, which ran for fourteen episodes (albeit divided into three production codes and four narrative segments) during season 23 [79] Occasionally, serials were loosely connected by a story line, such as season 8 focusing on the Doctor battling a rogue Time Lord called the Master, [80] [81] season 16's quest for the Key to Time, [82] season 18's journey through E-Space and the theme of entropy, [83] and season 20's Black Guardian trilogy [84]\n\n\nMissing episodes\nBetween 1967 and 1978, large amounts of older material stored in the BBC's various video tape and film libraries was either destroyed [h] or wiped This included many early episodes of Doctor Who, those stories featuring the first two Doctors: William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton In all, 97 of 253 episodes produced during the programme's first six years are not held in the BBC's archives (most notably seasons 3, 4, and 5, from which 79 episodes are missing) [99] [100] In 1972, almost all episodes then made were known to exist at the BBC, [101] while by 1978 the practice of wiping tapes and destroying \"spare\" film copies had been brought to a stop [102]\n\n\nCharacters\nThe Doctor was initially shrouded in mystery In the programme's early days, the character was an eccentric alien traveller of great intelligence who battled injustice while exploring time and space in an unreliable time machine, the \"TARDIS\" (an acronym for Time and Relative Dimension in Space), which notably appears much larger on the inside than on the outside [i] [113]\n\n\nThe Doctor\nThe Doctor was initially shrouded in mystery In the programme's early days, the character was an eccentric alien traveller of great intelligence who battled injustice while exploring time and space in an unreliable time machine, the \"TARDIS\" (an acronym for Time and Relative Dimension in Space), which notably appears much larger on the inside than on the outside [i] [113]\n\n\nChanges of appearance\nProducers introduced the concept of regeneration to permit the recasting of the main character This was prompted by the poor health of the original star, William Hartnell [116] [117] The term \"regeneration\" was not conceived until the Doctor's third on-screen regeneration; Hartnell's Doctor merely described undergoing a \"renewal\", and the Second Doctor underwent a \"change of appearance\" [118] [119] The device has allowed for the recasting of the actor various times in the show's history, as well as the depiction of alternative Doctors either from the Doctor's relative past or future [120]\n\n\nMeetings of different incarnations\nThere have been instances of actors returning later to reprise their specific Doctor's role In 1973's The Three Doctors, William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee For 1983's \"The Five Doctors\", Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted Shada serial For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's The Two Doctors with Colin Baker [138]\n\n\nCompanions\nThe companion figure – generally a human – has been a constant feature in Doctor Who since the programme's inception in 1963 One of the roles of the companion is to be a reminder for the Doctor's \"moral duty\" [149] The Doctor's first companions seen on-screen were his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford) and her teachers Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) and Ian Chesterton (William Russell) These characters were intended to act as audience surrogates, through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor, who was to act as a mysterious father figure [149] The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is \"The Deadly Assassin\" (1976) [150] Notable companions from the earlier series include Romana (Mary Tamm and Lalla Ward), a Time Lady; Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen); and Jo Grant (Katy Manning) [151] [152] Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; [153] sometimes they return home or find new causes—or loves—on worlds they have visited Some have died during the course of the series [154] Companions are usually humans or humanoid aliens [153]\n\n\nFoes\nWhen Sydney Newman commissioned the series, he specifically did not want to perpetuate the cliché of the \"bug-eyed monster\" of science fiction [168] However, monsters were popular with audiences and so became a staple of Doctor Who almost from the beginning [169] Daleks, Cybermen, and the Master are some of the most iconic foes the Doctor has battled in the series [9]\n\n\nDaleks\nThe Daleks, which first appeared in the show's second serial in 1963, [173] [174] are Doctor Who's oldest villains The Daleks are Kaleds from the planet Skaro, mutated by the scientist Davros and housed in mechanical armour shells for mobility The actual creatures resemble octopuses with large, pronounced brains Their armour shells have a single eye-stalk, a sink-plunger-like device that serves the purpose of a hand, and a directed-energy weapon Their main weakness is their eyestalk;  attacks upon them using various weapons can blind a Dalek, making it go mad Their chief role in the series plot, as they frequently remark in their instantly recognisable metallic voices, is to \"exterminate\" all non-Dalek beings They even attack the Time Lords in the Time War, as shown during the 50th Anniversary of the show They continue to be a recurring 'monster' within the Doctor Who franchise, having appeared in every series since 2005 [175] Davros has also been a recurring figure since his debut in Genesis of the Daleks, although played by several different actors [176]\n\n\nCybermen\nCybermen were originally a wholly organic species of humanoids originating on Earth's twin planet Mondas that began to implant more and more artificial parts into their bodies This led to the race becoming coldly logical and calculating cyborgs, with emotions usually only shown when naked aggression was called for With the demise of Mondas, they acquired Telos as their new home planet They continue to be a recurring 'monster' within the Doctor Who franchise [182] [183]\n\n\nThe Master\nThe Master is the Doctor's archenemy, a renegade Time Lord who desires to rule the universe Conceived as \"Professor Moriarty to the Doctor's Sherlock Holmes\", [187] the character first appeared in 1971 As with the Doctor, the role has been portrayed by several actors, since the Master is a Time Lord as well and able to regenerate; the first of these actors was Roger Delgado, who continued in the role until his death in 1973 The Master was briefly played by Peter Pratt and Geoffrey Beevers until Anthony Ainley took over and continued to play the character until Doctor Who's hiatus in 1989 [188] The Master returned in the 1996 television movie of Doctor Who, and was played by American actor Eric Roberts [189]\n\n\nMusic\nThe Doctor Who theme music was one of the first electronic music signature tunes for television, and after more than a half century remains one of the most easily recognised The original theme was composed by Ron Grainer and realised by Delia Derbyshire of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, with assistance from Dick Mills, and was released as a single on Decca F 11837 in 1964 The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of season 17 (1979–1980) It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of analogue tape containing recordings of a single plucked string, white noise, and the simple harmonic waveforms of test-tone oscillators, intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music New techniques were invented to allow mixing of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines On hearing the finished result, Grainer asked, \"Jeez, Delia, did I write that?\" She answered, \"Most of it.\" [194] Although Grainer was willing to give Derbyshire the co-composer credit, it was against BBC policy at the time She would not receive an on-screen credit until the 50th-anniversary story \"The Day of the Doctor\" in 2013 [195] [196]\n\n\nTheme music\nThe Doctor Who theme music was

[196]\n\n\nIncidental music\nMost of the innovative incidental music for Doctor Who has been specially commissioned from freelance composers, although in the early years some episodes also used stock music, as well as occasional excerpts from original recordings or cover versions of songs by popular music acts such as The Beatles and The Beach Boys Since its 2005 return, the series has featured occasional use of excerpts of pop music from the 1970s to the 2000s [citation needed]\n\n\nViewership\nPremiering the day after the assassination of John F Kennedy, the first episode of Doctor Who was repeated with the second episode the following week [214] [215] Doctor Who has always appeared initially on the BBC's mainstream BBC One channel, where it is regarded as a family show, drawing audiences of many millions of viewers; [216] [217] The programme's popularity has waxed and waned over the decades, with three notable periods of high ratings [218] The first of these was the \"Dalekmania\" period (c. 1964–1965), when the popularity of the Daleks regularly brought Doctor Who ratings of between 9 and 14 million, even for stories which did not feature them [218] The second was the mid to late 1970s, when Tom Baker occasionally drew audiences of over 12 million [218]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nPremiering the day after the assassination of John F Kennedy, the first episode of

1964, a year after the show first aired As of November 2013 [update], the modern series has been broadcast in more than 50 countries [226] The 50th anniversary episode, \"The Day of the Doctor\", was broadcast in 94 countries and screened to more than half a million people in cinemas across Australia, Latin America, North America and Europe The scope of the broadcast was a world record, according to Guinness World Records [227]\n\n\nOceania\nNew Zealand was the first country outside the United Kingdom to screen Doctor Who, beginning in September 1964, and continued to screen the series for many years, including the new revived series that aired on Prime Television from 2005 to 2017 [231] In 2018, the series is aired on Fridays on TVNZ 2, and on TVNZ On Demand on the same episode as the UK [232] The series moved to TVNZ 1 in 2021, [citation needed] before TVNZ lost the rights to the show altogether in 2022 [233]\n\n\nAmericas\nThe series also has a fan base in the United States, where it was shown in syndication from the 1970s to the 1990s, particularly on PBS stations [235]\n\n\nAsia\nSeries 1 through 3 of Doctor Who were broadcast on various NHK channels from 2006 to 2008 with Japanese subtitles [242] Beginning on 2 August 2009, upon the launch of Disney XD in Japan, the series has been broadcast with Japanese dubbing [243]\n\n\nHome media\nA wide selection of serials is available from BBC Video on DVD, on sale in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and the United States Every fully extant serial has been released on VHS, and BBC Worldwide continues to regularly release serials on DVD The 2005 series is also available in its entirety on UMD for the PlayStation Portable Eight original series serials have been released on Laserdisc [244] and many have also been released on Betamax tape and Video 2000 One episode of Doctor Who (The Infinite Quest) was released on VCD Initially, only the series from 2005 onwards were also available on Blu-ray, along with the 1996 TV film Doctor Who, released in September 2016 [245] However in March 2021, it was announced that the classic run would be released on Blu-ray starting with seasons 12 and 19 [246]\n\n\nAdaptations and other appearances\nThere are two Dr Who feature films: Dr Who and the Daleks, released in 1965 and Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D in 1966 Both are retellings of existing television stories (specifically, the first two Dalek serials, The Daleks and The Dalek Invasion of Earth respectively) with a larger budget and alterations to the series concept [citation needed]\n\n\nFilms\nThere are two Dr Who feature films: Dr Who and the Daleks, released in 1965 and Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D in 1966 Both are retellings of existing television stories (specifically, the first two Dalek serials, The Daleks and The Dalek Invasion of Earth respectively) with a larger budget and alterations to the series concept [citation needed]\n\n\nSpin-offs\nDoctor Who has appeared on stage numerous times In the early 1970s, Trevor Martin played the role in Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday In the late 1980s, Jon Pertwee and Colin Baker both played the Doctor at different times during the run of a play titled Doctor Who – The Ultimate Adventure For two performances, while Pertwee was ill, David Banks (better known for playing Cybermen) played the Doctor Other original plays have been staged as amateur productions, with other actors playing the Doctor, while Terry Nation wrote The Curse of the Daleks, a stage play mounted in the late 1960s, but without the Doctor [citation needed]\n\n\nAftershows\nWhen the revived series of Doctor Who was brought back, an aftershow series was created by the BBC, titled Doctor Who Confidential There have been three aftershow series created, with the latest one titled Doctor Who: The Fan Show, which began airing from the tenth series Each series follows behind-the-scenes footage on the making of Doctor Who through clips and interviews with the cast, production crew and other people, including those who have participated in the television series in some manner Each episode deals with a different topic, and in most cases refers to the Doctor Who episode that preceded it [citation needed]\n\n\nCharity episodes and appearances\nIn 1983, coinciding with the series' 20th anniversary, \"The Five Doctors\" was shown as part of the annual BBC Children in Need Appeal, however it was not a charity-based production, simply scheduled within the line-up of Friday 25 November 1983 This was the programme's first co-production with Australian broadcaster ABC [283] At 90 minutes long it was the longest single episode of Doctor Who produced to date It featured three of the first five Doctors, a new actor to replace the deceased William Hartnell, and unused footage to represent Tom Baker [284]\n\n\nSpoofs and cultural references\nDoctor Who has been satirised and spoofed on many occasions by comedians including Spike Milligan (a Dalek invades his bathroom—Milligan, naked, hurls a soap sponge at it) and Lenny Henry Jon Culshaw frequently impersonates the Fourth Doctor in the BBC Dead Ringers series [292] Doctor Who fandom has also been lampooned on programs such as Saturday Night Live, The Chaser's War on Everything, Mystery Science Theater 3000, Family Guy, American Dad!, Futurama, South Park,\nCommunity as Inspector Spacetime, The Simpsons and The Big Bang Theory [citation needed] As part of the 50th-anniversary programmes, former Fifth Doctor Peter Davison directed, wrote, and co-starred in the parody The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot, which also starred two other former Doctors, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy, and had cameo appearances from cast and crew involved in the programme, including showrunner Steven Moffat and Doctors Paul McGann, David Tennant, and Matt Smith [293]\n\n\nAudio\nThe earliest Doctor Who–related audio release was a 21-minute narrated abridgement of the First Doctor television story The Chase released in 1966  Ten years later, the first original Doctor Who audio was released on LP record; Doctor Who and the Pescatons featuring the Fourth Doctor [303] The first commercially available audiobook was an abridged reading of the Fourth Doctor story State of Decay in 1981 In 1988, during a hiatus in the television show, Slipback, the first radio drama, was transmitted [304]\n\n\nBooks\nDoctor Who books have been published from the mid-sixties through to the present day From 1965 to 1991 the books published were primarily novelised adaptations of broadcast episodes; beginning in 1991 an extensive line of original fiction was launched, the Virgin New Adventures and Virgin Missing Adventures Since the relaunch of the programme in 2005, a new range of novels has been published by BBC Books Numerous non-fiction books about the series, including guidebooks and critical studies, have also been published, [citation needed] and a dedicated Doctor Who Magazine (DWM) with newsstand circulation has been published regularly since 1979: DWM is recognised by Guinness World Records as the longest running TV tie-in magazine, celebrating 40 years of continuous publication on 11 October 2019 [315] This is published by Panini, as is the Doctor Who Adventures magazine for younger fans [316]\n\n\nVideo games\nNumerous Doctor Who video games have been created from the mid-80s through to the present day A Doctor Who game was planned for the Sega Mega Drive but never released [317] One of the recent ones is a match-3 game released in November 2013 for iOS, Android, Amazon App Store and Facebook called Doctor Who: Legacy It has been constantly updated since its release and features all the Doctors as playable characters as well as over 100 companions [318]\n\n\nChronology and canonicity\nSince the creation of the Doctor Who character by BBC Television in the early 1960s, a myriad of stories have been published about Doctor Who, in different media: apart from the actual television episodes that continue to be produced by the BBC, there have also been novels, comics, short stories, audio books, radio plays, interactive video games, game books, webcasts, DVD extras, and stage performances The BBC takes no position on the canonicity of any of such stories, and producers of the show have expressed distaste for the idea of canonicity [325]\n\n\nAwards\nThe show has received recognition as one of Britain's finest television programmes, winning the 2006 British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series and five consecutive (2005–2010) awards at the National Television Awards during Russell T Davies' tenure as executive producer [326] [327] In 2011, Matt Smith became the first Doctor to be nominated for a BAFTA Television Award for Best Actor, [328] and in 2016, Michelle Gomez became the first woman to receive a BAFTA nomination for the series, getting a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her work as Missy [329]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nCited texts\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nScholarly

{"title": "Online_gambling", "content": "\nHistory\nIn 1994, Antigua and Barbuda passed the Free Trade & Processing Act, allowing licences to be granted to organisations applying to open online casinos [9] Before online casinos, the first fully functional gambling software was developed by Microgaming, an Isle of Man-based software company This was secured with software developed by CryptoLogic, an online security software company Safe transactions became viable; this led to the first online casinos in 1994 [9]\n\n\nForms\nThe internet has allowed new types of gambling to be available online Improvements in technology have changed betting habits just as video lottery terminals, keno, and scratchcards changed the gambling industry in the 20th century.\n\n\nPoker\nOnline poker tables commonly offer Texas hold 'em, Omaha hold 'em, seven-card stud, razz, HORSE, and other game types in both tournament and cash game structures Players play against each other rather than the \"house\", with the card room making its money through \"rake\" and through tournament fees.\n\n\nCasinos\nThere are a large number of online casinos in which people can play casino games such as roulette, blackjack, pachinko, baccarat, and many others These games are played against the \"house\" which makes money because the odds are in its favor.\n\n\nSweepstakes online casinos\nSweepstakes online casinos represent an alternative approach to online gambling, providing a platform for casino-style gaming within jurisdictions where traditional online gambling faces legal constraints These platforms are characterized by a sweepstakes model, differentiating them from standard online casinos by enabling users to participate in gaming without directly wagering real money.\n\n\nSports betting\nSports betting is the activity of predicting sports results and placing a wager on the outcome Usually, the wager is in the form of money.\n\n\nBingo\nOnline bingo is the game of bingo (US|UK) played on the internet.\n\n\nLotteries\nMost lotteries are run by governments and are heavily protected from competition due to their ability to generate large taxable cash flows The first online lotteries were run by private individuals or companies and licensed to operate by small countries Most private online lotteries have stopped trading as governments have passed new laws giving themselves and their own lotteries greater protection Government-controlled lotteries now offer their games online.\n\n\nUK National Lottery\nThe National Lottery was started in 1994 and is operated by the Camelot Group Around 70% of UK adults play the National Lottery regularly, making the average annual sales over £5 billion apart from the year 2000–2001 where sales dropped just below that In its first 17 years, it has created over 2,800 millionaires [21]\n\n\nHorse racing betting\nHorse racing betting comprises a significant percentage of online gambling wagers and all major Internet bookmakers, betting exchanges, and sports books offer a wide variety of horse racing betting markets.\n\n\nMobile gambling\nMobile gambling refers to playing games of chance or skill for money by using a remote device such as a  tablet computer, smartphone or a mobile phone with a wireless Internet connection.\n\n\nAdvance-deposit wagering\nAdvance-deposit wagering (ADW) is a form of gambling on the outcome of horse races in which the bettor must fund his or her account before being allowed to place bets ADW is often conducted online or by phone In contrast to ADW, credit shops allow wagers without advance funding; accounts are settled at month-end Racetrack owners, horse trainers and state governments sometimes receive a share of ADW revenues.\n\n\nVirtual sports\nVirtual Sports are electronic games that generate visual feedback on a display device The term \"virtual sports\" is often used to describe software simulations of sports used for betting purposes Some betting house and racinos use this kind of software because clients use to bet more than with the normal sports [25]\n\n\nFunds transfers\nThe money for online gambling can come from credit card, electronic check, certified check, money order, wire transfer, or cryptocurrencies Normally, gamblers upload funds to the online gambling company, make bets or play the games that it offers, and then cash out any winnings Gamblers can often fund gambling accounts by credit card or debit card, and cash out winnings directly back to the card; most U.S banks, however, prohibit the use of their cards for the purpose of Internet gambling, and attempts by Americans to use credit cards at Internet gambling sites are usually rejected [26] A number of electronic money services offer accounts with which online gambling can be funded.\n\n\nLegal status\nWhile casinos are regulated and not penalized in Argentina, online apps that emulate online casinos work differently Although these online casinos are not illegal in Argentina, its regulation is controlled by provincial jurisdiction as there is no federal law that prohibits online gambling.  This means that, as opposed to some other countries in the world that have a federal law to regulate this practice, each of the 23 provinces and Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires in Argentina are able to take their own measures and pass their own legislation when it comes to online gambling [27] which also forces users to stay informed about what is happening at provincial level [28]\n\n\nArgentina\nWhile casinos are regulated and not penalized in

in the province and, up to 2021, it was the only province in Argentina to set forth the regulation of online gaming Authorities agree that revising and modernizing the laws that are imposed on online casinos will combat illegal gambling, both for the safety of users and the transparency of operations [28] The regulation allows only individuals or legal entities holding a license issued by the Provincial Institute of Lotteries and Casinos, a public authority overseeing gambling, to participate in online games and bets [32]\n\n\nCórdoba\nIn 2021, the Bill No 34270 was passed and established the regulation of online gambling activities in the province of Córdoba The legislators that proposed this law were Orlando Arduh, Silvia Paleo, Darío Capitani, Raúl Recalde and Alberto Ambrosio The

gambling activities available to Canadians [50] For online gambling operations within Canada's borders, the Canadian authorities are willing to prosecute, but as of this date, have only done so once,

Appeals decision to the United States Supreme Court The court granted certiorari on 27 June 2017, considering the question of whether a federal statute (i.e., the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act) that prohibits modification or repeal of a state's law prohibiting private behavior impermissibly commandeers the power of the states [120]\n\n\nOther countries\nVarious forms of online gambling are legal and regulated in many countries, including some provinces and territories of Canada, most members of the European Union and several nations in and around the Caribbean Sea.\n\n\nOnline gambling industry statistics\nIn the UK, between 2009 and 2010, 4% of adults had bet online [123] Between April 2010 and March 2011, online gambling which is regulated by the UK

channelled or white market accounted for €15.9bn, reflecting an average EU-wide channelling rate of 71.7% Online gambling now represents 23.2% of the total EU gambling market activity, while offline gambling (lotteries, casinos, bookmakers shops, etc.) had a total GGR of €73.5bn, accounting for 76.8% of the overall EU gambling market In 2018, the UK market (34.2%) accounted for the largest portion of the EU online gambling market, based on GGR, followed by Germany (11.1%), France (8.8%) and Italy (8.1%) [125]\n\n\nUnited States of America\nThe American Gaming Association predicts that

[126]\n\n\nProblem gambling\nGambling affects two main areas of the brain, specially the ventral  striatum and the prefrontal cortex The ventral striatum is the portion of the brain that processes rewards and emotions The prefrontal cortex is the front portion of the brain that controls planning, complex problem-solving, personality and processing potential consequences Scientists have also found that people with gambling disorders have reduced activity in their prefrontal cortex and increased connectivity to their reward system [127]\n\n\nParts of the Brain Affected by Online Gambling\nGambling affects two main areas of the brain, specially the ventral  striatum and the prefrontal cortex The ventral striatum is the portion of the brain that processes rewards and emotions The prefrontal cortex is the front portion of the brain that controls planning, complex problem-solving, personality and processing potential consequences Scientists have also found that people with gambling disorders have reduced activity in their prefrontal cortex and increased connectivity to their reward system [127]\n\n\nPsychological Effects and Symptoms of Online Problem Gambling\nSome people become addicted when they gamble compulsively Compulsive gambling is characterized by a compelling and intense desire to gamble and it is difficult to control When people gamble, dopamine is released This hormone produces feelings of pleasure and reward When people win bets, they feel excited and their brains release feel-good chemicals When people become addicted to gambling, these chemicals are no longer released by other pleasurable things [129]\n\n\nGambling Like Activities and Its Effect on Children\nWhile “Gambling like” is not technically gambling, they share many similarities and phycological effects [135] As the scope of the internet changes, it's important to watch as other areas of life evolve into the online world With the popularization of new forms \"gambling like activities\", such as lottery style loot boxes, authors David Zendle and Heather Wardle gathered results from a cross-sectional online survey, where they found \"the odds of problem gambling were 11.4 times higher among those who purchased loot boxes with their own money.” [136] They believe young adults who willingly participate with loot boxes should considered as a high-risk group for problem gambling [136]\n\n\nPersonality Disorders and Compulsive Gambling\nAccording to the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 5th Edition (DSM-5), personality disorders are categorized into clusters [137] Cluster A includes paranoid and schizoid disorders, among others; Cluster B includes antisocial, borderline, histrionic and narcissistic disorders and cluster C includes avoidant and obsessive-compulsive disorders, among others Pathological gambling is a disorder characterized by a compulsive need to gamble, leading to significant harm in areas such as mental health, finances, relationships, and career [138] Cluster B personality disorders are the most prevalent among problem gamblers Borderline personality disorder, corresponding to cluster B, is one of the most common personality disorders among compulsive gamblers People diagnosed with borderline personality disorder tend to engage in high-risk activities due to challenges regulating emotional states to a healthy, stable baseline [citation needed]\n\n\nPossible Treatment\nTreatment for people with compulsive gambling begins with recognizing the problem Compulsive gamblers often deny they have a problem or need treatment [139]\n\n\nMoney laundering\nIt has also been alleged that the largely unsupervised electronic funds transfers inherent in online gambling are being exploited by criminal interests to launder large amounts of money [143]  However, according to a US GAO study, \"Banking and gaming regulatory officials did not view Internet gambling as being particularly susceptible to money laundering, especially when credit cards, which create a transaction record and are subject to relatively low transaction limits, were used for payment Likewise, credit card and gaming industry officials did not believe Internet gambling posed any particular risks in terms of money laundering.\" [26]\n\n\nPlayer perception\nPlayers' attitudes towards sites plays an important role in online purchases and customer loyalty Lack of trust in payment systems and security are primary reasons for avoiding online gambling [148] Due to the virtual nature of online gambling, it is hard for players to verify the authenticity [ambiguous] of sites they are using [149] Unlike in physical casinos, randomness and deck shuffling cannot be verified by visual means unless the casino is provably fair Players interact with other players through GUIs, which connect to the gambling site's server in a non-transparent manner [150] [additional citation(s) needed] In an online survey [when?] of 10,838 online casino and poker players from over 96 countries, respondents reported a high level of mistrust of online gambling 91.5% believed that reputable third party reports on randomness and payouts were important to gain their trust [149] However, contrasting research shows that seals-of-approval granted by these third parties does not have a strong influence on purchasing behavior, nor are customers usually aware of their existence [151]\n\n\nResponsible gambling\nResponsible Gambling Features (RGFs) are features that online gambling sites use to promote responsible behavior and reduce harm These include limiting amounts that can be bet or deposited over a designated period of time, self-assessment tests for gambling problems, and warning signs of prolonged play or high expenditure [149] RGFs are usually opt-in features for players and are required by certain jurisdictions For example, operators in Denmark, Germany, and Spain must provide deposit limits, but this is voluntary for Australian operators [149] A sample of online poker players from Sweden indicated that RGFs increase their trust in a company and reduce their anxiety about winning from other players [152] However, in jurisdictions that mandate Responsible Gambling Features, only a small percentage of customers use them In Australia, 0.8% used the deposit limit on SportsBet and 6% used deposit loss limits on BetFair Australia [153]\n\n\nSee also\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Online Gambling**\n\nOnline gambling, also known as internet gambling, is the act of placing bets or wagers on events or games through the internet. This form of gambling has become increasingly popular over the past few decades, with an estimated 1.6 billion people participating in online gambling activities worldwide.\n\n**History**\n\nThe history of online gambling dates back to the 1990s, when the first online casinos were established. In 1994, Antigua and Barbuda passed the Free Trade & Processing Act, allowing licenses to be granted to organizations applying to open online casinos. This move was followed by the development of the first fully functional gambling software by Microgaming, an Isle of Man-based software company. The software was secured with software developed by CryptoLogic, an online security software company. This led to the first online casinos in 1994.\n\n**Forms**\n\nThe internet has allowed new types of gambling to be available online, including online poker, casinos, sports betting, lottery games, and bingo. These forms of gambling have become increasingly popular, with many people participating in online gaming activities. The rise of online gambling has also led to the development of new forms of gaming, such as esports and virtual sports.\n\n**Poker**\n\nOnline poker is a popular form of online gaming, where players can participate in tournaments and cash games. Online poker tables commonly offer Texas hold'em, Omaha hold'em, seven-card stud, razz, HORSE, and other game types. Players play against each other rather than the \"house\", with the card room making its money through \"rake\" and through tournament fees.\n\n**Casinos**\n\nOnline casinos offer a wide range of games, including roulette, blackjack, pachinko, baccarat, and many others. These games are played against the \"house\" which makes money because the odds are in its favor. Online casinos have become increasingly popular, with many people participating in online gaming activities.\n\n**Sweepstakes Online Casinos**\n\nSweepstakes online casinos represent an alternative approach to online gambling, providing a platform for casino-style gaming within jurisdictions where traditional online gambling faces legal constraints. These platforms are characterized by a sweepstakes model, differentiating them from standard online casinos by enabling users to participate in gaming without directly wagering real money.\n\n**Sports Betting**\n\nSports betting is the activity of predicting sports results and placing a wager on the outcome. Usually, the wager is in the form of money. Online sports betting has become increasingly popular, with many people participating in online gaming activities.\n\n**Bingo**\n\nOnline bingo is the game of bingo played on the internet. Online bingo has become increasingly popular, with many people participating in online gaming activities.\n\n**Lotteries**\n\nMost lotteries are run by governments and are heavily protected from competition due to their ability to generate large taxable cash flows. The first online lotteries were run by private individuals or companies and licensed to operate by small countries. Most private online lotteries have stopped trading as governments have passed new laws giving themselves and their own lotteries greater protection. Government-controlled lotteries now offer their games online.\n\n**UK National Lottery**\n\nThe National Lottery was started in 1994 and is operated by the Camelot Group. Around 70% of UK adults play the National Lottery regularly, making the average annual sales over £5 billion apart from the year 2000-2001 where sales dropped just below that. In its first 17 years, it has created over 2,800 millionaires.\n\n**Horse Racing Betting**\n\nHorse racing betting comprises a significant percentage of online gambling wagers and all major Internet bookmakers, betting exchanges, and sports books offer a wide variety of horse racing betting markets.\n\n**Mobile Gambling**\n\nMobile gambling refers to playing games of chance or skill for money by using a remote device such as a tablet computer, smartphone or a mobile phone with a wireless internet connection.\n\n**Advance-Deposit Wagering**\n\nAdvance-deposit wagering (ADW) is a form of gambling on the outcome of horse races in which the bettor must fund his or her account before being allowed to place bets. ADW is often conducted online or by phone. In contrast to ADW, credit shops allow wagers without advance funding; accounts are settled at month-end. Racetrack owners, horse trainers and state governments sometimes receive a share of ADW revenues.\n\n**Virtual Sports**\n\nVirtual Sports are electronic games that generate visual feedback on a display device. The term \"virtual sports\" is often used to describe software simulations of sports used for betting purposes. Some betting house and racinos use this kind of software because clients use to bet more than with the normal sports.\n\n**Funds Transfers**\n\nThe money for online gambling can come from credit card, electronic check, certified check, money order, wire transfer, or cryptocurrencies. Normally, gamblers upload funds to the online gambling company, make bets or play the games that it offers, and then cash out any winnings. Gamblers can often fund gambling accounts by credit card or debit card, and cash out winnings directly back to the card; most U.S banks, however, prohibit the use of their cards for the purpose of Internet gambling, and attempts by Americans to use credit cards at Internet gambling sites are usually rejected. A number of electronic money services offer accounts with which online gambling can be funded.\n\n**Legal Status**\n\nWhile casinos are regulated and not penalized in Argentina, online apps that emulate online casinos work differently. Although these online casinos are not illegal in Argentina, its regulation is controlled by provincial jurisdiction as there is no federal law that prohibits online gambling. This means that, as opposed to some other countries in the world that have a federal law to regulate this practice, each of the 23 provinces and Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires in Argentina are able to take their own measures and pass their own legislation when it comes to online gambling.\n\n**Australia**\n\nOn 28 June 2001 the Australian Government passed the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 (IGA). The government said that the IGA was important to protect Australians from the harmful effects of gambling.

casinos [9] Before online casinos, the first fully functional gambling software was developed by Microgaming, an Isle of Man-based software company This was secured with software developed by CryptoLogic, an online security software company Safe transactions became viable; this led to the first online casinos in 1994 [9]\n\n\nForms\nThe internet has allowed new types of gambling to be available online Improvements in technology have changed betting habits just as video lottery terminals, keno, and scratchcards changed the gambling industry in the 20th century.\n\n\nPoker\nOnline poker tables commonly offer Texas hold 'em, Omaha hold 'em, seven-card stud, razz, HORSE, and other game types in both tournament and cash game structures Players play against each other rather than the \"house\", with the card room making its money through \"rake\" and through tournament fees.\n\n\nCasinos\nThere are a large number of online casinos in which people can play casino games such as roulette, blackjack, pachinko, baccarat, and many others These games are played against the \"house\" which makes money because the odds are in its favor.\n\n\nSweepstakes online casinos\nSweepstakes online casinos represent an alternative approach to online gambling, providing a platform for casino-style gaming within jurisdictions where traditional online gambling faces legal constraints These platforms are characterized by a sweepstakes model, differentiating them from standard online casinos by enabling users to participate in gaming without directly wagering real money.\n\n\nSports betting\nSports betting is the activity of predicting sports results and placing a wager on the outcome Usually, the wager is in the form of money.\n\n\nBingo\nOnline bingo is the game of bingo (US|UK) played on the internet.\n\n\nLotteries\nMost lotteries are run by governments and are heavily protected from competition due to their ability to generate large taxable cash flows The first online lotteries were run by private individuals or companies and licensed to operate by small countries Most private online lotteries have stopped trading as governments have passed new laws giving themselves and their own lotteries greater protection Government-controlled lotteries now offer their games online.\n\n\nUK National Lottery\nThe National Lottery was started in 1994 and is operated by the Camelot Group Around 70% of UK adults play the National Lottery regularly, making the average annual sales over £5 billion apart from the year 2000–2001 where sales dropped just below that In its first 17 years, it has created over 2,800 millionaires [21]\n\n\nHorse racing betting\nHorse racing betting comprises a significant percentage of online gambling wagers and all major Internet bookmakers, betting exchanges, and sports books offer a wide variety of horse racing betting markets.\n\n\nMobile gambling\nMobile gambling refers to playing games of chance or skill for money by using a remote device such as a  tablet computer, smartphone or a mobile phone with a wireless Internet connection.\n\n\nAdvance-deposit wagering\nAdvance-deposit wagering (ADW) is a form of gambling on the outcome of horse races in which the bettor must fund his or her account before being allowed to place bets ADW is often conducted online or by phone In contrast to ADW, credit shops allow wagers without advance funding; accounts are settled at month-end Racetrack owners, horse trainers and state governments sometimes receive a share of ADW revenues.\n\n\nVirtual sports\nVirtual Sports are electronic games that generate visual feedback on a display device The term \"virtual sports\" is often used to describe software simulations of sports used for betting purposes Some betting house and racinos use this kind of software because clients use to bet more than with the normal sports [25]\n\n\nFunds transfers\nThe money for online gambling can come from credit card, electronic check, certified check, money order, wire transfer, or cryptocurrencies Normally, gamblers upload funds to the online gambling company, make bets or play the games that it offers, and then cash out any winnings Gamblers can often fund gambling accounts by credit card or debit card, and cash out winnings directly back to the card; most U.S banks, however, prohibit the use of their cards for the purpose of Internet gambling, and attempts by Americans to use credit cards at Internet gambling sites are usually rejected [26] A number of electronic money services offer accounts with which online gambling can be funded.\n\n\nLegal status\nWhile casinos are regulated and not penalized in Argentina, online apps that emulate online casinos work differently Although these online casinos are not illegal in Argentina, its regulation is controlled by provincial jurisdiction as there is no federal law that prohibits online gambling.  This means that, as opposed to some other countries in the world that have a federal law to regulate this practice, each of the 23 provinces and Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires in Argentina are able to take their own measures and pass their own legislation when it comes to online gambling [27] which also forces users to stay informed about what is happening at provincial level [28]\n\n\nArgentina\nWhile casinos are regulated and not penalized in

Autónoma de Buenos Aires in Argentina are able to take their own measures and pass their own legislation when it comes to online gambling [27] which also forces users to stay informed about what is happening at provincial level [28]\n\n\nBuenos Aires\nIn 2018, Buenos Aires was the first province in Argentina to pass its own law, No 15079, [31] that approved the legal operation of online casinos in the province and, up to 2021, it was the only province in Argentina to set forth the regulation of online gaming Authorities agree that revising and modernizing the laws that are imposed on online casinos will combat illegal gambling, both for the safety of users and the transparency of operations [28] The regulation allows only individuals or legal entities holding a license issued by the Provincial Institute of Lotteries and Casinos, a public authority overseeing gambling, to participate in online games and bets [32]\n\n\nCórdoba\nIn 2021, the Bill No 34270 was passed and established the regulation of online gambling activities in the province of Córdoba The legislators that proposed this law were Orlando Arduh, Silvia Paleo, Darío Capitani, Raúl Recalde and Alberto Ambrosio The bill became law No 10793 after legislators noticed the urgent need for regulation in online gambling The legislator Silvia Paleo spoke about this law and said that new legislation is “the only possible step towards responsible gambling” and also that it is the “responsibility of the State” to make gambling secure [33]\n\n\nAntigua and Barbuda\nMany of the companies operating out of the island nation of Antigua and Barbuda are publicly traded on various stock exchanges, specifically the London Stock Exchange Antigua has met British regulatory standards and has been added to the UK's \"white list\", which allows licensed Antiguan companies to advertise in the UK [37]\n\n\nAustralia\nOn 28 June 2001 the Australian Government passed the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 (IGA) The government said that the IGA was important to protect Australians from the harmful effects of gambling The offense applies to all interactive gambling service providers, whether based in Australia or offshore, whether Australian or foreign owned The IGA makes it an offence to provide an interactive gambling service to a customer physically present in Australia, but it is not an offence for Australian residents to play poker or casino games online Sports betting online is legal in Australia, with many state government licensed sportsbooks in operation [citation needed]\n\n\nBangladesh\nGambling in Bangladesh is illegal Online gambling busts are frequently conducted [43] [44] Related laws include: The Public Gambling Act (1867), [45] Money laundering, the Foreign Currency Act, Digital Security Act However, comprehensive laws regarding online gambling is lacking [46] In some region cable tv is blocked to curtail online sports betting [47]\n\n\nBelarus\nOnline gambling has been legalized in Belarus since April 1, 2019 [49]\n\n\nCanada\nWhile the criminal code of Canada does not prohibit online gambling, it does prohibit any type of gambling at an establishment not owned or licensed by a provincial government Not withstanding this fact, there are an estimated 1,200 to 1,400 offshore websites that make casino type games and other gambling activities available to Canadians [50] For online gambling operations within Canada's borders, the Canadian authorities are willing to prosecute, but as of this date, have only done so once, when British Columbia prosecuted Starnet Communications International (\"SCI\"), a Delaware corporation, run by residents of Vancouver, where one of the company's servers was located The court found that SCI had sufficient contact with Canada to be prosecuted under its criminal code SCI was fined $100,000 and forfeited nearly $4 million in profits It has since moved its operations overseas [51]\n\n\nFrance\nOn 5 March 2009, France proposed new laws to regulate and tax Internet gambling Budget minister Eric Woerth stated the French gambling market would expand to adapt to \"Internet reality.\" He further stated \"Rather than banning 25,000 websites, we'd rather give licenses to those who will respect public and social order.\" [57] Betting exchanges, however, will remain illegal under the new plans.\n\n\nGermany\nThe German Interstate Treaty on gaming, which came into force on 1 January 2008, banned all forms of online gaming and betting in the country, with the exception of wagers on horse racing The European Gaming & Betting Association turned to the European Commission with the request to take action against the German legislation, because such stringent legislation violated EU rules [58] In 2010, the European Court of Justice ruled that the monopolised gambling industry in Germany has to be liberalised Schleswig-Holstein is the only German state that has already come up with their own gambling bill allowing gambling online From 2012, casino operators can apply for an online gambling license in this state [59]\n\n\nIndia\nOnline gambling is illegal in the state of Maharashtra under the \"Bombay Wager Act\" Other acts/legislations are silent with respect to online gambling/online gaming in India  The most recent law to address gambling online was the Federal Information Technology Rules where such illegal activities may be blocked by Internet providers within India  Another act is the Public Gaming Act of 1867  States tend to operate on their own authority.\n\n\nIsrael\nThe Israel gambling law (Israeli Penal Law 5737 - 1977) does not refer specifically to online gambling (land based gambling and playing games of chances is prohibited except in the cases of the Israel Lottery and the Israeli Commission for Sports Gambling) In December 2005, the attorney general ordered all online gambling operations, online backgammon included, to close their businesses and at the same time commanded credit card companies to cease cooperating with online gambling websites [65] In May 2007, the attorney general had excluded the online backgammon website Play65 from the ruling, due to \"the unique circumstances of the site's activity\", allowing it to return to full activity in Israel [66]\n\n\nPoland\nIn December 2016 the amendment to the Polish Gambling Act was scheduled to come into force on 1 April 2017 Online gambling will be only possible on the sites with Polish license.\n\n\nRussia\nRussian legislation, enacted in December 2006, prohibits online gambling altogether (as well as any gambling relying on telecommunications technology) [67]\n\n\nSingapore\nIn 2014, the Singapore parliament tabled the Remote Gambling Bill as a counter-measure against online gambling locally, [68] while parliamentary member Denise Phua spoke against legalised gambling in Singapore [69]\n\n\nUkraine\nGambling was prohibited in Ukraine in 2009 after a fire occurred in an illegal gambling hall in Dnipro (former Dnipropetrovsk), in which nine people died [70]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nIn 2003 Tessa Jowell, then Culture Secretary suggested a change in the British Gambling laws to keep up with advances in technology.\n\n\nRemote gambling\nThe Bill defined remote gambling as,\n\n\nUnited States\nLegislation on online gambling in the United States was first drafted in the late 1990s Bob Goodlatte and Jon Kyl introduced bills to the Senate that would curb online gambling activities except for those that involved horse and dog races and state lotteries [81] Those bills were not passed.\n\n\nNew Jersey legalizes online sports betting\nOn 8 November 2011, New Jersey voters were asked to consider \"Public Question No 1\", also known as the Sports Betting Amendment New Jersey required a majority vote to amend its state constitution The result was 671,797 \"Yes\" (63.91%) to 379,339 \"No\" (36.09%) The voters' approval allowed the New Jersey legislature to legalize sports betting [111]\n\n\nSports leagues sue Governor Christie Twice\nOn 7 August 2012, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, National Football League, National Basketball League, National Hockey League, and Major League Baseball sued Governor Christie in NCAA, et al v Christie The leagues contended that New Jersey's new Sports Wagering Law violated the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 [114]\n\n\nThe Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act overturned\nOn 7 October 2016, New Jersey appealed the Third Circuit Court of Appeals decision to the United States Supreme Court The court granted certiorari on 27 June 2017, considering the question of whether a federal statute (i.e., the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act) that prohibits modification or repeal of a state's law prohibiting private behavior impermissibly commandeers the power of the states [120]\n\n\nOther countries\nVarious forms of online gambling are legal and regulated in many countries, including some provinces and territories of Canada, most members of the European Union and several nations in and around the Caribbean Sea.\n\n\nOnline gambling industry statistics\nIn the UK, between 2009 and 2010, 4% of adults had bet online [123] Between April 2010 and March 2011, online gambling which is regulated by the UK Gambling Commission yielded £660.74 million, a 5% increase on the previous year The British regulated online gambling sector was worth a 12% market share of the British regulated gambling industry within the same time period Most British consumer online gambling activity is on overseas regulated websites, and estimates place the UK consumer market for online gambling at £1.9 billion for 2010 (Approximately three times the size of the British regulated market) In the year to March 2011, 5000 adults were surveyed and reported that 11.2% of them had participated in at least one form of remote gambling in the previous four weeks Approximately half of the respondents had only participated in National Lottery products Another group of interviews conducted by the Gambling Commission [124]\n\n\nUK\nIn the UK, between 2009 and 2010, 4% of adults had bet online [123] Between April 2010 and March 2011, online gambling which is regulated by the UK Gambling Commission yielded £660.74

weeks Approximately half of the respondents had only participated in National Lottery products Another group of interviews conducted by the Gambling Commission [124]\n\n\nEuropean Union\nAccording to the European Gaming and Betting Association (EGBA), online gambling is a growing sector within the EU, with gross gaming revenue (GGR) expected to reach €29.3 billion in 2022 According to EGBA, the EU online gambling market was valued at €22.2 billion GGR in 2018 - growing 11% from €20 billion GGR in 2017 - and accounted for 49.2% of the global online gambling market The EU online gambling channelled or white market accounted for €15.9bn, reflecting an average EU-wide channelling rate of 71.7% Online gambling now represents 23.2% of the total EU gambling market activity, while offline gambling (lotteries, casinos, bookmakers shops, etc.) had a total GGR of €73.5bn, accounting for 76.8% of the overall EU gambling market In 2018, the UK market (34.2%) accounted for the largest portion of the EU online gambling market, based on GGR, followed by Germany (11.1%), France (8.8%) and Italy (8.1%) [125]\n\n\nUnited States of America\nThe American Gaming Association predicts that betting Americans will wager around $35 million on sportsbooks during the 2024 NFL season This is expected to be the most wagered on NFL season in the past 7 years of legal betting within the sport [126]\n\n\nProblem gambling\nGambling affects two main areas of the brain, specially the ventral  striatum and the prefrontal cortex The ventral striatum is the portion of the brain that processes rewards and emotions The prefrontal cortex is the front portion of the brain that controls planning, complex problem-solving, personality and processing potential consequences Scientists have also found that people with gambling disorders have reduced activity in their prefrontal cortex and increased connectivity to their reward system [127]\n\n\nParts of the Brain Affected by Online Gambling\nGambling affects two main areas of the brain, specially the ventral  striatum and the prefrontal cortex The ventral striatum is the portion of the brain that processes rewards and emotions The prefrontal cortex is the front portion of the brain that controls planning, complex problem-solving, personality and processing potential consequences Scientists have also found that people with gambling disorders have reduced activity in their prefrontal cortex and increased connectivity to their reward system [127]\n\n\nPsychological Effects and Symptoms of Online Problem Gambling\nSome people become addicted when they gamble compulsively Compulsive gambling is characterized by a compelling and intense desire to gamble and it is difficult to control When people gamble, dopamine is released This hormone produces feelings of pleasure and reward When people win bets, they feel excited and their brains release feel-good chemicals When people become addicted to gambling, these chemicals are no longer released by other pleasurable things [129]\n\n\nGambling Like Activities and Its Effect on Children\nWhile “Gambling like” is not technically gambling, they share many similarities and phycological effects [135] As the scope of the internet changes, it's important to watch as other areas of life evolve into the online world With the popularization of new forms \"gambling like activities\", such as lottery style loot boxes, authors David Zendle and Heather Wardle gathered results from a cross-sectional online survey, where they found \"the odds of problem gambling were 11.4 times higher among those who purchased loot boxes with their own money.” [136] They believe young adults who willingly participate with loot boxes should considered as a high-risk group for problem gambling [136]\n\n\nPersonality Disorders and Compulsive Gambling\nAccording to the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 5th Edition (DSM-5), personality disorders are categorized into clusters [137] Cluster A includes paranoid and schizoid disorders, among others; Cluster B includes antisocial, borderline, histrionic and narcissistic disorders and cluster C includes avoidant and obsessive-compulsive disorders, among others Pathological gambling is a disorder characterized by a compulsive need to gamble, leading to significant harm in areas such as mental health, finances, relationships, and career [138] Cluster B personality disorders are the most prevalent among problem gamblers Borderline personality disorder, corresponding to cluster B, is one of the most common personality disorders among compulsive gamblers People diagnosed with borderline personality disorder tend to engage in high-risk activities due to challenges regulating emotional states to a healthy, stable baseline [citation needed]\n\n\nPossible Treatment\nTreatment for people with compulsive gambling begins with recognizing the problem Compulsive gamblers often deny they have a problem or need treatment [139]\n\n\nMoney laundering\nIt has also been alleged that the largely unsupervised electronic funds transfers inherent in online gambling are being exploited by criminal interests to launder large amounts of money [143]  However, according to a US GAO study, \"Banking and gaming regulatory officials did not view Internet gambling as being particularly susceptible to money laundering, especially when credit cards, which create a transaction record and are subject to relatively low transaction limits, were used for payment Likewise, credit card and gaming industry officials did not believe Internet gambling posed any particular risks in terms of money laundering.\" [26]\n\n\nPlayer perception\nPlayers' attitudes towards sites plays an important role in online purchases and customer loyalty Lack of trust in payment systems and security are primary reasons for avoiding online gambling [148] Due to the virtual nature of online gambling, it is hard for players to verify the authenticity [ambiguous] of sites they are using [149] Unlike in physical casinos, randomness and deck shuffling cannot be verified by visual means unless the casino is provably fair Players interact with other players through GUIs, which connect to the gambling site's server in a non-transparent manner [150] [additional citation(s) needed] In an online survey [when?] of 10,838 online casino and poker players from over 96 countries, respondents reported a high level of mistrust of online gambling 91.5% believed that reputable third party reports on randomness and payouts were important to gain their trust [149] However, contrasting research shows that seals-of-approval granted by these third parties does not have a strong influence on purchasing behavior, nor are customers usually aware of their existence [151]\n\n\nResponsible gambling\nResponsible Gambling Features (RGFs) are features that online gambling sites use to promote responsible behavior and reduce harm These include limiting amounts that can be bet or deposited over a designated period of time, self-assessment tests for gambling problems, and warning signs of prolonged play or high expenditure [149] RGFs are usually opt-in features for players and are required by certain jurisdictions For example, operators in Denmark, Germany, and Spain must provide deposit limits, but this is voluntary for Australian operators [149] A sample of online poker players from Sweden indicated that RGFs increase their trust in a company and reduce their anxiety about winning from other players [152] However, in jurisdictions that mandate Responsible Gambling Features, only a small percentage of customers use them In Australia, 0.8% used the deposit limit on SportsBet and 6% used deposit loss limits on BetFair Australia [153]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

of the Sources (2000), and Chicago (2018) He has written several non-fiction texts, and children's stories, including True and False: Heresy and Common Sense for the Actor (1997)  In 2004 he published a lauded version of the classical Faust story, Faustus, however, when the play was staged in San Francisco during the spring of 2004, it was not well received by critics [28] On May 1, 2010, Mamet released a graphic novel The Trials of Roderick Spode (The Human Ant).\n\n\nTelevision and radio\nMamet wrote one episode of Hill Street Blues, \"A Wasted Weekend\", that aired in 1987 His then-wife, Lindsay Crouse, appeared in numerous episodes (including that one) as Officer McBride Mamet is also the creator, producer and frequent writer of the television series The Unit, where he wrote a well-circulated memo to the writing staff He directed a third-season episode of The Shield with Shawn Ryan In 2007, Mamet directed two television commercials for Ford Motor Company The two 30-second ads featured the Ford Edge and were filmed in Mamet's signature style of fast-paced dialogue and clear, simple imagery Mamet's sister, Lynn, is a producer and writer for television shows, such as The Unit and Law & Order.\n\n\nStyle and reception\nMamet's style of writing dialogue, marked by a cynical, street-smart edge, has come to be called Mamet speak [32] Mamet himself has criticized his (and other writers') tendency to write \"pretty\" at the expense of sound, logical plots [33] When asked how he developed his style for writing dialogue, Mamet said, \"In my family, in the days prior to television, we liked to while away the evenings by making ourselves miserable, based solely on our ability to speak the language viciously That's probably where my ability was honed.\" [34]\n\n\nMamet

frequently sparked debate and controversy [35] Following a 1992 staging of Oleanna, a play in which a college student  accuses her professor of trying to rape her, [36] a critic reported that the play divided the audience by gender and recounted that \"couples emerged screaming at each other\" [35]\n\n\nArchives\nThe papers of David Mamet were sold to the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin in 2007 and first opened for research in 2009 [38] The growing collection consists mainly of manuscripts and related production materials for most of his plays, films, and other writings, but also includes his personal journals from 1966 to 2005 In 2015, the Ransom Center secured a second major addition to Mamet's papers, including more recent works Additional materials

satirical cartoons with themes including political strife in Israel [40] In a 2008 essay at The Village Voice titled \"Why I Am No Longer a 'Brain-Dead Liberal'\" [41] he discussed how his political views had shifted from liberalism to conservatism In interviews, Mamet has highlighted his agreement with free market theorists such as Friedrich Hayek, [42] the historian Paul Johnson, and economist Thomas Sowell, whom Mamet called \"one of our greatest minds\" In 2022, Mamet declined to explicitly label himself a Republican, but described himself as a conservative who \"would like to conserve those things I grew up with: the love of family, the love of the country, love of service, love of God, love of community\" [5]\n\n\nWorks\nShort film\n\n\nTheatre\nShort film\n\n\nFilm\nShort

{"title": "Periodic_table", "content": "\nStructure\n1\n\n\nGroup names and numbers\nUnder an international naming convention, the groups are numbered numerically from 1 to 18 from the leftmost column (the alkali metals) to the rightmost column (the noble gases) The f-block groups are ignored in this numbering [22] Groups can also be named by their first element, e.g the \"scandium group\" for group 3 [22] Previously, groups were known by Roman numerals In the United States, the Roman numerals were followed by either an \"A\" if the group was in the s- or p-block, or a \"B\" if the group was in the d-block The Roman numerals used correspond to the last digit of today's naming convention (e.g the group 4 elements were group IVB, and the group 14 elements were group IVA) In Europe, the lettering was similar, except that \"A\" was used for groups 1 through 7, and \"B\" was used for groups 11 through 17 In addition, groups 8, 9 and 10 used to be treated as one triple-sized group, known collectively in both notations as group VIII In 1988, the new IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) naming system (1–18) was put into use, and the old group names (I–VIII) were deprecated [23]\n\n\nPresentation forms\n32 columns\n\n\nElectron configurations\nThe periodic table is a graphic description of the periodic law, [36] which states that the properties and atomic structures of the chemical elements are a periodic function of their atomic number [37] Elements are placed in the periodic table according to their electron configurations, [38] the periodic recurrences of which explain the trends in properties across the periodic table [39]\n\n\nOrder of subshell filling\nThe sequence in which the subshells are filled is given in most cases by the Aufbau principle, also known as the Madelung or Klechkovsky rule (after Erwin Madelung and Vsevolod Klechkovsky respectively) This rule was first observed empirically by Madelung, and Klechkovsky and later authors gave it theoretical justification [46] [47] [48] [49] [g] The shells overlap in energies, and the Madelung rule specifies the sequence of filling according to: [47]\n\n\nElectron configuration table\nThe following table shows the electron configuration of a neutral gas-phase atom of each element Different configurations can be favoured in different chemical environments [52] The main-group elements have entirely regular electron configurations; the transition and inner transition elements show twenty irregularities due to the aforementioned competition between subshells close in energy level For the last ten elements (109–118), experimental data is lacking [79] and therefore calculated configurations have been shown instead [80] Completely filled subshells have been greyed out.\n\n\nVariations\nAlthough the modern periodic table is standard today, the placement of the period 1 elements hydrogen and helium remains an open issue under discussion, and some variation can be found [57] [81] Following their respective s1 and s2 electron configurations, hydrogen would be placed in group 1, and helium would be placed in group 2 [57] The group 1 placement of hydrogen is common, but helium is almost always placed in group 18 with the other noble gases [6] The debate has to do with conflicting understandings of the extent to which chemical or electronic properties should decide periodic table placement [81]\n\n\nPeriod 1\nAlthough the modern periodic table is standard today, the placement of the period 1 elements hydrogen and helium remains an open issue under discussion, and some variation can be found [57] [81] Following their respective s1 and s2 electron configurations, hydrogen would be placed in group 1, and helium would be placed in group 2 [57] The group 1 placement of hydrogen is common, but helium is almost always placed in group 18 with the other noble gases [6] The debate has to do with conflicting understandings of the extent to which chemical or electronic properties should decide periodic table placement [81]\n\n\nGroup 3\nIn many periodic tables, the f-block is shifted one element to the right, so that lanthanum and actinium become d-block elements in group 3, and Ce–Lu and Th–Lr form the f-block Thus the d-block is split into two very uneven portions This is a holdover from early mistaken measurements of electron configurations; modern measurements are more consistent with the form with lutetium and lawrencium in group 3, and with La–Yb and Ac–No as the f-block [25] [99]\n\n\nPeriodic trends\nAs chemical reactions involve the valence electrons, [32] elements with similar outer electron configurations may be expected to react similarly and form compounds with similar proportions of elements in them [113] Such elements are placed in the same group, and thus there tend to be clear similarities and trends in chemical behaviour as one proceeds down a group [114] As analogous configurations occur at regular intervals, the properties of the elements thus exhibit periodic recurrences, hence the name of the periodic table and the periodic law These periodic recurrences were noticed well before the underlying theory that explains them was developed [115] [116]\n\n\nAtomic radius\nHistorically, the physical size of atoms was unknown until the early 20th century The first calculated estimate of the atomic radius of hydrogen was published by physicist Arthur Haas in 1910 to within an order of magnitude (a factor of 10) of the accepted value, the Bohr radius (~0.529 Å) In his model, Haas used a single-electron configuration based on the classical atomic model proposed by J J Thomson in 1904, often called the plum-pudding model [117]\n\n\nIonisation energy\nThe first ionisation energy of an atom is the energy required to remove an electron from it This varies with the atomic radius: ionisation energy increases left to right and down to up, because electrons that are closer to the nucleus are held more tightly and are more difficult to remove Ionisation energy thus is minimized at the first element of each period – hydrogen and the alkali metals – and then generally rises until it reaches the noble gas at the right edge of the period [32] There are some exceptions to this trend, such as oxygen, where the electron being removed is paired and thus interelectronic repulsion makes it easier to remove than expected [131]\n\n\nElectron affinity\nThe opposite property to ionisation energy is the electron affinity, which is the energy released when adding an electron to the atom [133] A passing electron will be more readily attracted to an atom if it feels the pull of the nucleus more strongly, and especially if there is an available partially filled outer orbital that can accommodate it Therefore, electron affinity tends to increase down to up and left to right The exception is the last column, the noble gases, which have a full shell and have no room for another electron This gives the halogens in the next-to-last column the highest electron affinities [32]\n\n\nValence and oxidation states\nThe valence of an element can be defined either as the number of hydrogen atoms that can combine with it to form a simple binary hydride, or as twice the number of oxygen atoms that can combine with it to form a simple binary oxide (that is, not a peroxide or a superoxide) [110] The valences of the main-group elements are directly related to the group number: the hydrides in the main groups 1–2 and 13–17 follow the formulae MH, MH2, MH3, MH4, MH3, MH2, and finally MH The highest oxides instead increase in valence, following the formulae M2O, MO, M2O3, MO2, M2O5, MO3, M2O7 [l] Today the notion of valence has been extended by that of the oxidation state, which is the formal charge left on an element when all other elements in a compound have been removed as their ions [113]\n\n\nElectronegativity\nAnother important property of elements is their electronegativity Atoms can form covalent bonds to each other by sharing electrons in pairs, creating an overlap of valence orbitals The degree to which each atom attracts the shared electron pair depends on the atom's electronegativity [144] – the tendency of an atom towards gaining or losing electrons [32] The more electronegative atom will tend to attract the electron pair more, and the less electronegative (or more electropositive) one will attract it less In extreme cases, the electron can be thought of as having been passed completely from the more electropositive atom to the more electronegative one, though this is a simplification The bond then binds two ions, one positive (having given up the electron) and one negative (having accepted it), and is termed an ionic bond [32]\n\n\nMetallicity\nA simple substance is a substance formed from atoms of one chemical element The simple substances of the more electronegative atoms tend to share electrons (form covalent bonds) with each other They form either small molecules (like hydrogen or oxygen, whose atoms bond in pairs) or giant structures stretching indefinitely (like carbon or silicon) The noble gases simply stay as single atoms, as they already have a full shell [32] Substances composed of discrete molecules or single atoms are held together by weaker attractive forces between the molecules, such as the London dispersion force: as electrons move within the molecules, they create momentary imbalances of electrical charge, which induce similar imbalances on nearby molecules and create synchronized movements of electrons across many neighbouring molecules [148]\n\n\nFurther manifestations of periodicity\nThere are some other relationships throughout the periodic table between elements that are not in the same group, such as the diagonal relationships between elements that are diagonally adjacent (e.g lithium and magnesium) [121] Some similarities can also be found between the main groups and the transition metal groups, or between the early actinides and early transition metals, when the elements have the same number of valence electrons Thus uranium somewhat resembles chromium and tungsten in group 6, [121] as all three have six valence electrons [180] Relationships between elements with the same number of valence electrons but different types of valence orbital have been called secondary or isodonor relationships: they usually have the same maximum oxidation states, but not the same minimum oxidation states For example, chlorine and manganese both have +7 as their maximum oxidation state (e.g Cl2O7 and Mn2O7), but their respective minimum oxidation states are −1 (e.g HCl) and −3 (K2 [Mn(CO)4]) Elements with the same number of valence vacancies but different numbers of valence electrons are related by a tertiary or isoacceptor relationship: they usually have similar minimum but not maximum oxidation states For example, hydrogen and chlorine both have −1 as their minimum oxidation state (in hydrides and chlorides), but hydrogen's maximum oxidation state is +1 (e.g H2O) while chlorine's is +7 [58]\n\n\nClassification of elements\nMany terms have been used in the literature to describe sets of elements that behave similarly The group names alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, triel, tetrel, pnictogen, chalcogen, halogen, and noble gas are acknowledged by IUPAC; the other groups can be referred to by their number, or by their first element (e.g., group 6 is the chromium group) [22] [182] Some divide the p-block elements from groups 13 to 16 by metallicity, [177] [175] although there is neither an IUPAC definition nor a precise consensus on exactly which elements should be considered metals, nonmetals, or semi-metals (sometimes called metalloids) [177] [175] [22] Neither is there a consensus on what the metals succeeding the transition metals ought to be called, with post-transition metal and poor metal being among the possibilities having been used Some advanced monographs exclude the elements of group 12 from the transition metals on the grounds of their sometimes quite different chemical properties, but this is not a universal practice [183] and IUPAC does not presently mention it as allowable in its Principles of Chemical Nomenclature [184]\n\n\nHistory\nIn 1817, German physicist Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner began to formulate one of the earliest attempts to classify the elements [199] In 1829, he found that he could form some of the elements into groups of three, with the members of each group having related properties He termed these groups triads [200] [201] Chlorine, bromine, and iodine formed a triad; as did calcium, strontium, and barium; lithium, sodium, and potassium; and sulfur, selenium, and tellurium Today, all these triads form part of modern-day groups: the halogens, alkaline earth metals, alkali metals, and chalcogens [202] Various chemists continued his work and were able to identify more and more relationships between small groups of elements However, they could not build one scheme that encompassed them all [203]\n\n\nEarly history\nIn 1817, German physicist Johann

were able to identify more and more relationships between small groups of elements However, they could not build one scheme that encompassed them all [203]\n\n\nMendeleev\nThe definitive breakthrough came from the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev Although other chemists (including Meyer) had found some other versions of the periodic system at about the same time, Mendeleev was the most dedicated to developing and defending his system, and it was his system that most affected the scientific community [207] On 17 February 1869 (1 March 1869 in the Gregorian calendar), Mendeleev began arranging the elements and comparing them by their atomic weights He began with a few elements, and over the course of the day his system grew until it encompassed most of the known elements After he found a consistent arrangement, his printed table appeared in May 1869 in the journal of the Russian Chemical Society [208] When elements did not appear to fit in the system, he boldly predicted that either valencies or atomic weights had been measured incorrectly, or that there was a missing element yet to be discovered [58] In 1871, Mendeleev published a long article, including an updated form of his table, that made his predictions for unknown elements explicit Mendeleev predicted the properties of three of these unknown elements in detail: as they would be missing heavier homologues of boron, aluminium, and silicon, he named them eka-boron, eka-aluminium, and eka-silicon (\"eka\" being Sanskrit for \"one\") [208] [209]: 45 \nIn 1875, the French chemist Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, working without knowledge of Mendeleev's prediction, discovered a new element in a sample of the mineral sphalerite, and named it gallium He isolated the element and began determining its properties Mendeleev, reading de Boisbaudran's publication, sent a letter claiming that gallium was his predicted eka-aluminium Although Lecoq de Boisbaudran was initially sceptical, and suspected that Mendeleev was trying to take credit for his discovery, he later admitted that Mendeleev was correct [210] In 1879, the Swedish chemist Lars Fredrik Nilson discovered a new element, which he named scandium: it turned out to be eka-boron Eka-silicon was found in 1886 by German chemist Clemens Winkler, who named it germanium The properties of gallium, scandium, and germanium matched what Mendeleev had predicted [211] In 1889, Mendeleev noted at the Faraday Lecture to the Royal Institution in London that he had not expected to live long enough \"to mention their discovery to the Chemical Society of Great Britain as a confirmation of the exactitude and generality of the periodic law\" [212] Even the discovery of the noble gases at the close of the 19th century, which Mendeleev had not predicted, fitted neatly into his scheme as an eighth main group [213]\n\n\nAtomic number\nAfter the internal structure of the atom was probed, amateur Dutch physicist Antonius van den Broek proposed in 1913 that the nuclear charge determined the placement of elements in the periodic table [214] [215] The New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford coined the word \"atomic number\" for this nuclear charge [216] In van den Broek's published article he illustrated the first electronic periodic table showing the elements arranged according to the number of their electrons [217] Rutherford confirmed in his 1914 paper that Bohr had accepted the view of van den Broek [218]\n\n\nElectron shells\nThe Danish physicist Niels Bohr applied Max Planck's idea of quantization to the atom He concluded that the energy levels of electrons were quantised: only a discrete set of stable energy states were allowed Bohr then attempted to understand periodicity through electron configurations, surmising in 1913 that the inner electrons should be responsible for the chemical properties of the element [223] [224] In 1913, he produced the first electronic periodic table based on a quantum atom [225]\n\n\nSynthetic elements\nBy 1936, the pool of missing elements from hydrogen to uranium had shrunk to four: elements 43, 61, 85, and 87 remained missing Element 43 eventually became the first element to be synthesized artificially via nuclear reactions rather than discovered in nature It was discovered in 1937 by Italian chemists Emilio Segrè and Carlo Perrier, who named their discovery technetium, after the Greek word for \"artificial\" [242] Elements 61 (promethium) and 85 (astatine) were likewise produced artificially in 1945 and 1940 respectively; element 87 (francium) became the last element to be discovered in nature, by French chemist Marguerite Perey in 1939 [243] [u] The elements beyond uranium were likewise discovered artificially, starting with Edwin McMillan and Philip Abelson's 1940 discovery of neptunium (via bombardment of uranium with neutrons) [75] Glenn T Seaborg and his team at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) continued discovering transuranium elements, starting with plutonium in 1941, and discovered that contrary to previous thinking, the elements from actinium onwards were congeners of the lanthanides rather than transition metals [244] Bassett (1892), Werner (1905), and the French engineer Charles Janet (1928) had previously suggested this, but their ideas did not then receive general acceptance [33] Seaborg thus called them the actinides [244] Elements up to 101 (named mendelevium in honour of Mendeleev) were synthesized up to 1955, either through neutron or alpha-particle irradiation, or in nuclear explosions in the cases of 99 (einsteinium) and 100 (fermium) [75]\n\n\nFuture extension beyond the seventh period\nThe most recently named elements – nihonium (113), moscovium (115), tennessine (117), and oganesson (118) – completed the seventh row of the periodic table [6] Future elements would have to begin an eighth row These elements may be referred to either by their atomic numbers (e.g \"element 164\"), or by the IUPAC systematic element names adopted in 1978, which directly relate to the atomic numbers (e.g \"unhexquadium\" for element 164, derived from Latin unus \"one\", Greek hexa  \"six\", Latin quadra \"four\", and the traditional -ium suffix for metallic elements) [6] All attempts to synthesize such elements have failed so far An attempt to make element 119 has been ongoing since 2018 at the Riken research institute in Japan The LBNL in the United States, the JINR in Russia, and the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL) in China also plan to make their own attempts at synthesizing the first few period 8 elements [257] [258] [259] [260] [261] [262]\n\n\nAlternative periodic tables\nThe periodic law may be represented in multiple ways, of which the standard periodic table is only one [284] Within 100 years of the appearance of Mendeleev's table in 1869, Edward G Mazurs had collected an estimated 700 different published versions of the periodic table [180] [285] Many forms retain the rectangular structure, including Charles Janet's left-step periodic table (pictured below), and the modernised form of Mendeleev's original 8-column layout that is still common in Russia Other periodic table formats have been shaped much more exotically, such as spirals (Otto Theodor Benfey's pictured to the right), circles and triangles [286]\n\n\nSee

periodic law, which states that the properties and atomic structures of the chemical elements are a periodic function of their atomic number. The periodic table is a tabular display of the known chemical elements, organized by their atomic number (number of protons in the nucleus), electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties. The elements are listed in order of increasing atomic number (number of protons in the nucleus) and are grouped into rows called periods and columns called groups or families.\n\n**Structure**\n\nThe periodic table is constructed by arranging the elements in a grid, with rows representing the periods and columns representing the groups. The elements in each group are characterized by having the same number of electrons in their outermost energy level, which determines their chemical properties. The elements in each period exhibit a recurring pattern of chemical properties as the number of electrons in the outermost energy level increases.\n\n**Group Names and Numbers**\n\nUnder an international naming convention, the groups are numbered numerically from 1 to 18 from the leftmost column (the alkali metals) to the rightmost column (the noble gases). The f-block groups are ignored in this numbering. Groups can also be named by their first element, e.g., the \"scandium group\" for group 3. Previously, groups were known by Roman numerals. In the United States, the Roman numerals were followed by either an \"A\" if the group was in the s- or p-block, or a \"B\" if the group was in the d-block. The Roman numerals used correspond to the last digit of today's naming convention.\n\n**Presentation Forms**\n\nThe periodic table is a graphic description of the periodic law, and its presentation forms vary. The standard periodic table is one of the most commonly used forms, but there are many alternative forms, including spiral and circular periodic tables.\n\n**Electron Configurations**\n\nThe periodic table is a graphic description of the periodic law, which states that the properties and atomic structures of the chemical elements are a periodic function of their atomic number. The electron configuration of an element is a description of the arrangement of electrons in the atom's energy levels. The electron configuration of an element can be written in a shorthand notation, using the symbol of the element, the number of electrons in the outermost energy level, and the symbol of the energy level.\n\n**Order of Subshell Filling**\n\nThe sequence in which the subshells are filled is given in most cases by the Aufbau principle, also known as the Madelung or Klechkovsky rule. This rule was first observed empirically by Madelung, and Klechkovsky and later authors gave it theoretical justification.\n\n**Electron Configuration Table**\n\nThe following table shows the electron configuration of a neutral gas-phase atom of each element. Different configurations can be favored in different chemical environments. The main-group elements have entirely regular electron configurations; the transition and inner transition elements show twenty irregularities due to the aforementioned competition between subshells close in energy level.\n\n| Element | Atomic Number | Electron Configuration |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| H | 1 | 1s1 |\n| He | 2 | 1s2 |\n| Li | 3 | 1s2 2s1 |\n| Be | 4 | 1s2 2s2 |\n| B | 5 | 1s2 2s2 2p1 |\n| C | 6 | 1s2 2s2 2p2 |\n| N | 7 | 1s2 2s2 2p3 |\n| O | 8 | 1s2 2s2 2p4 |\n| F | 9 | 1s2 2s2 2p5 |\n| Ne | 10 | 1s2 2s2 2p6 |\n| Na | 11 | 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s1 |\n| Mg | 12 | 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 |\n| Al | 13 | 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p1 |\n| Si | 14 | 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p2 |\n| P | 15 | 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p3 |\n| S | 16 | 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p4 |\n| Cl | 17 | 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p5 |\n| Ar | 18 | 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 |\n\n**Variations**\n\nAlthough the modern periodic table is standard today, the placement of the period 1 elements hydrogen and helium remains an open issue under discussion, and some variation can be found. Following their respective s1 and s2 electron configurations, hydrogen would be placed in group 1, and helium would be placed in group 2.\n\n**Group 3**\n\nIn many periodic tables, the f-block is shifted one element to the right, so that lanthanum and actinium become d-block elements in group 3, and Ce–Lu and Th–Lr form the f-block. This is a holdover from early mistaken measurements of electron configurations.\n\n**Periodic Trends**\n\nAs chemical reactions involve the valence electrons, elements with similar outer electron configurations may be expected to react similarly and form compounds with similar proportions of elements in them. Such elements are placed in the same group, and thus there tend to be clear similarities and trends in chemical behavior as one proceeds down a group.\n\n**Atomic Radius**\n\nHistorically, the physical size of atoms was unknown until the early 20th century. The first calculated estimate of the atomic radius of hydrogen was published by physicist Arthur Haas in 1910 to within an order of magnitude (a factor of 10) of the accepted value, the Bohr radius (~0.529 Å).\n\n**Ionisation Energy**\n\nThe first ionisation energy of an atom is the energy required to remove an electron from it. This varies with the atomic radius: ionisation energy increases left to right and down to up, because electrons that are closer to the nucleus are held more tightly and are more difficult to remove.\n\n**Electron Affinity**\n\nThe opposite property to ionisation energy is the electron affinity, which is the energy released when adding an electron to the atom. A passing electron will be more readily attracted to an atom if it feels the pull of the nucleus more strongly, and especially if there is an available partially filled outer orbital that can accommodate it.\n\n**Valence and Oxidation States**\n\nThe valence of an element can be defined either as the number of hydrogen atoms that can combine with it to form a simple binary hydride, or as twice the number of oxygen atoms that can combine with it to form a simple binary oxide. The valences of the main-group elements are directly related to the group number.\n\n**Electronegativity**\n\nAnother important property of elements is their electronegativity. Atoms can form covalent bonds to each other by sharing electrons in pairs, creating an overlap of valence orbitals. The degree to which each atom attracts the shared electron pair depends on the atom's electronegativity.\n\n**Metallicity**\n\nA simple substance is a substance formed from atoms of one chemical element. The simple substances of the more electronegative atoms tend to share electrons (form covalent bonds) with each other. They form either small molecules (like hydrogen or oxygen, whose atoms bond in pairs) or giant structures stretching indefinitely (like carbon or silicon).\n\n**Further Manifestations of Periodicity**\n\nThere are some other relationships throughout the periodic table between elements that are not in the same group, such as the diagonal relationships between elements that are diagonally adjacent (e.g., lithium and magnesium).\n\n**Classification of Elements**\n\nMany terms have been used in the literature to describe sets of elements that behave similarly. The group names alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, triel, tetrel, pnictogen, chalcogen, halogen, and noble gas are acknowledged by IUPAC.\n\n**History**\n\nThe development of the periodic table is a story that spans centuries, with many scientists contributing to its development. The earliest attempts to classify the elements date back to the 17th century, but it wasn't until the 19th century that the modern periodic table began to take shape.\n\n**Early History**\n\nIn 1817, German physicist Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner began to formulate one of the earliest attempts to classify the elements. In 1829, he found that he could form some of the elements into groups of three, with the members of each group having related properties.\n\n**Mendeleev**\n\nThe definitive breakthrough came from the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev. Although other chemists (including Meyer) had found some other versions of the periodic system at about the same time, Mendeleev was the most dedicated to developing and defending his system, and it was his system that most affected the scientific community.\n\n**Atomic Number**\n\nAfter the internal structure of the atom was probed, amateur Dutch physicist Antonius van den Broek proposed in 1913 that the nuclear charge determined the placement of elements in the periodic table.\n\n**Electron Shells**\n\nThe Danish physicist Niels Bohr applied Max Planck's idea of quantization to the atom. He concluded that the energy levels of electrons were quantised: only a discrete set of stable energy states were allowed.\n\n**Synthetic Elements**\n\nBy 1936, the pool of missing elements from hydrogen to uranium had shrunk to four: elements 43, 61, 85, and 87 remained missing. Element 43 eventually became the first element to be synthesized artificially via nuclear reactions rather than discovered in nature.\n\n**Future Extension Beyond the Seventh Period**\n\nThe most recently named elements – nihonium (113), moscovium (115), tennessine (117), and oganesson (118) – completed the seventh row of the periodic table. Future elements would have to begin an eighth row.\n\n**Alternative Periodic Tables**\n\nThe periodic law may be represented in multiple ways, of which the standard periodic table is only one. Within 100 years of the appearance of Mendeleev's table in 1869, Edward G Mazurs had collected an estimated 700 different published versions of the periodic table.\n\n**See Also**\n\nThis article is a summary of the periodic table and its history.

outline:\n\n\nStructure\n1\n\n\nGroup names and numbers\nUnder an international naming convention, the groups are numbered numerically from 1 to 18 from the leftmost column (the alkali metals) to the rightmost column (the noble gases) The f-block groups are ignored in this numbering [22] Groups can also be named by their first element, e.g the \"scandium group\" for group 3 [22] Previously, groups were known by Roman numerals In the United States, the Roman numerals were followed by either an \"A\" if the group was in the s- or p-block, or a \"B\" if the group was in the d-block The Roman numerals used correspond to the last digit of today's naming convention (e.g the group 4 elements were group IVB, and the group 14 elements were group IVA) In Europe, the lettering was similar, except that \"A\" was used for groups 1 through 7, and \"B\" was used for groups 11 through 17 In addition, groups 8, 9 and 10 used to be treated as one triple-sized group, known collectively in both notations as group VIII In 1988, the new IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) naming system (1–18) was put into use, and the old group names (I–VIII) were deprecated [23]\n\n\nPresentation forms\n32 columns\n\n\nElectron configurations\nThe periodic table is a graphic description of the periodic law, [36] which states that the properties and atomic structures of the chemical elements are a periodic function of their atomic number [37] Elements are placed in the periodic table according to their electron configurations, [38] the periodic recurrences of which explain the trends in properties across the periodic table [39]\n\n\nOrder of subshell filling\nThe sequence in which the subshells are filled is given in most cases by the Aufbau principle, also known as the Madelung or Klechkovsky rule (after Erwin Madelung and Vsevolod Klechkovsky respectively) This rule was first observed empirically by Madelung, and Klechkovsky and later authors gave it theoretical justification [46] [47] [48] [49] [g] The shells overlap in energies, and the Madelung rule specifies the sequence of filling according to: [47]\n\n\nElectron configuration table\nThe following table shows the electron configuration of a neutral gas-phase atom of each element Different configurations can be favoured in different chemical environments [52] The main-group elements have entirely regular electron configurations; the transition and inner transition elements show twenty irregularities due to the aforementioned competition between subshells close in energy level For the last ten elements (109–118), experimental data is lacking [79] and therefore calculated configurations have been shown instead [80] Completely filled subshells have been greyed out.\n\n\nVariations\nAlthough the modern periodic table is standard today, the placement of the period 1 elements hydrogen and helium remains an open issue under discussion, and some variation can be found [57] [81] Following their respective s1 and s2 electron configurations, hydrogen would be placed in group 1, and helium would be placed in group 2 [57] The group 1 placement of hydrogen is common, but helium is almost always placed in group 18 with the other noble gases [6] The debate has to do with conflicting understandings of the extent to which chemical or electronic properties should decide periodic table placement [81]\n\n\nPeriod 1\nAlthough the modern periodic table is standard today, the placement of the period 1 elements hydrogen and helium remains an open issue under discussion, and some variation can be found [57] [81] Following their respective s1 and s2 electron configurations, hydrogen would be placed in group 1, and helium would be placed in group 2 [57] The group 1 placement of hydrogen is common, but helium is almost always placed in group 18 with the other noble gases [6] The debate has to do with conflicting understandings of the extent to which chemical or electronic properties should decide periodic table placement [81]\n\n\nGroup 3\nIn many periodic tables, the f-block is shifted one element to the right, so that lanthanum and actinium become d-block elements in group 3, and Ce–Lu and Th–Lr form the f-block Thus the d-block is split into two very uneven portions This is a holdover from early mistaken measurements of electron configurations; modern measurements are more consistent with the form with lutetium and lawrencium in group 3, and with La–Yb and Ac–No as the f-block [25] [99]\n\n\nPeriodic trends\nAs chemical reactions involve the valence electrons, [32] elements with similar outer electron configurations may be expected to react similarly and form compounds with similar proportions of elements in them [113] Such elements are placed in the same group, and thus there tend to be clear similarities and trends in chemical behaviour as one proceeds down a group [114] As analogous configurations occur at regular intervals, the properties of the elements thus exhibit periodic recurrences, hence the name of the periodic table and the periodic law These periodic recurrences were noticed well before the underlying theory that explains them was developed [115] [116]\n\n\nAtomic radius\nHistorically, the physical size of atoms was unknown until the early 20th century The first calculated estimate of the atomic radius of hydrogen was published by physicist Arthur Haas in 1910 to within an order of magnitude (a factor of 10) of the accepted value, the Bohr radius (~0.529 Å) In his model, Haas used a single-electron configuration based on the classical atomic model proposed by J J Thomson in 1904, often called the plum-pudding model [117]\n\n\nIonisation energy\nThe first ionisation energy of an atom is the energy required to remove an electron from it This varies with the atomic radius: ionisation energy increases left to right and down to up, because electrons that are closer to the nucleus are held more tightly and are more difficult to remove Ionisation energy thus is minimized at the first element of each period – hydrogen and the alkali metals – and then generally rises until it reaches the noble gas at the right edge of the period [32] There are some exceptions to this trend, such as oxygen, where the electron being removed is paired and thus interelectronic repulsion makes it easier to remove than expected [131]\n\n\nElectron affinity\nThe opposite property to ionisation energy is the electron affinity, which is the energy released when adding an electron to the atom [133] A passing electron will be more readily attracted to an atom if it feels the pull of the nucleus more strongly, and especially if there is an available partially filled outer orbital that can accommodate it Therefore, electron affinity tends to increase down to up and left to right The exception is the last column, the noble gases, which have a full shell and have no room for another electron This gives the halogens in the next-to-last column the highest electron affinities [32]\n\n\nValence and oxidation states\nThe valence of an element can be defined either as the number of hydrogen atoms that can combine with it to form a simple binary hydride, or as twice the number of oxygen atoms that can combine with it to form a simple binary oxide (that is, not a peroxide or a superoxide) [110] The valences of the main-group elements are directly related to the group number: the hydrides in the main groups 1–2 and 13–17 follow the formulae MH, MH2, MH3, MH4, MH3, MH2, and finally MH The highest oxides instead increase in valence, following the formulae M2O, MO, M2O3, MO2, M2O5, MO3, M2O7 [l] Today the notion of valence has been extended by that of the oxidation state, which is the formal charge left on an element when all other elements in a compound have been removed as their ions [113]\n\n\nElectronegativity\nAnother important property of elements is their electronegativity Atoms can form covalent bonds to each other by sharing electrons in pairs, creating an overlap of valence orbitals The degree to which each atom attracts the shared electron pair depends on the atom's electronegativity [144] – the tendency of an atom towards gaining or losing electrons [32] The more electronegative atom will tend to attract the electron pair more, and the less electronegative (or more electropositive) one will attract it less In extreme cases, the electron can be thought of as having been passed completely from the more electropositive atom to the more electronegative one, though this is a simplification The bond then binds two ions, one positive (having given up the electron) and one negative (having accepted it), and is termed an ionic bond [32]\n\n\nMetallicity\nA simple substance is a substance formed from atoms of one chemical element The simple substances of the more electronegative atoms tend to share electrons (form covalent bonds) with each other They form either small molecules (like hydrogen or oxygen, whose atoms bond in pairs) or giant structures stretching indefinitely (like carbon or silicon) The noble gases simply stay as single atoms, as they already have a full shell [32] Substances composed of discrete molecules or single atoms are held together by weaker attractive forces between the molecules, such as the London dispersion force: as electrons move within the molecules, they create momentary imbalances of electrical charge, which induce similar imbalances on nearby molecules and create synchronized movements of electrons across many neighbouring molecules [148]\n\n\nFurther manifestations of periodicity\nThere are some other relationships throughout the periodic table between elements that are not in the same group, such as the diagonal relationships between elements that are diagonally adjacent (e.g lithium and magnesium) [121] Some similarities can also be found between the main groups and the transition metal groups, or between the early actinides and early transition metals, when the elements have the same number of valence electrons Thus uranium somewhat resembles chromium and tungsten in group 6, [121] as all three have six valence electrons [180] Relationships between elements with the same number of valence electrons but different types of valence orbital have been called secondary or isodonor relationships: they usually have the same maximum oxidation states, but not the same minimum oxidation states For example, chlorine and manganese both have +7 as their maximum oxidation state (e.g Cl2O7 and Mn2O7), but their respective minimum oxidation states are −1 (e.g HCl) and −3 (K2 [Mn(CO)4]) Elements with the same number of valence vacancies but different numbers of valence electrons are related by a tertiary or isoacceptor relationship: they usually have similar minimum but not maximum oxidation states For example, hydrogen and chlorine both have −1 as their minimum oxidation state (in hydrides and chlorides), but hydrogen's maximum oxidation state is +1 (e.g H2O) while chlorine's is +7 [58]\n\n\nClassification of elements\nMany terms have been used in the literature to describe sets of elements that behave similarly The group names alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, triel, tetrel, pnictogen, chalcogen, halogen, and noble gas are acknowledged by IUPAC; the other groups can be referred to by their number, or by their first element (e.g., group 6 is the chromium group) [22] [182] Some divide the p-block elements from groups 13 to 16 by metallicity, [177] [175] although there is neither an IUPAC definition nor a precise consensus on exactly which elements should be considered metals, nonmetals, or semi-metals (sometimes called metalloids) [177] [175] [22] Neither is there a consensus on what the metals succeeding the transition metals ought to be called, with post-transition metal and poor metal being among the possibilities having been used Some advanced monographs exclude the elements of group 12 from the transition metals on the grounds of their sometimes quite different chemical properties, but this is not a universal practice [183] and IUPAC does not presently mention it as allowable in its Principles of Chemical Nomenclature [184]\n\n\nHistory\nIn 1817, German physicist Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner began to formulate one of the earliest attempts to classify the elements [199] In 1829, he found that he could form some of the elements into groups of three, with the members of each group having related properties He termed these groups triads [200] [201] Chlorine, bromine, and iodine formed a triad; as did calcium, strontium, and barium; lithium, sodium, and potassium; and sulfur, selenium, and tellurium Today, all these triads form part of modern-day groups: the halogens, alkaline earth metals, alkali metals, and chalcogens [202] Various chemists continued his work and were able to identify more and more relationships between small groups of elements However, they could not build one scheme that encompassed them all [203]\n\n\nEarly history\nIn 1817, German physicist Johann

came from the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev Although other chemists (including Meyer) had found some other versions of the periodic system at about the same time, Mendeleev was the most dedicated to developing and defending his system, and it was his system that most affected the scientific community [207] On 17 February 1869 (1 March 1869 in the Gregorian calendar), Mendeleev began arranging the elements and comparing them by their atomic weights He began with a few elements, and over the course of the day his system grew until it encompassed most of the known elements After he found a consistent arrangement, his printed table appeared in May 1869 in the journal of the Russian Chemical Society [208] When elements did not appear to fit in the system, he boldly predicted that either valencies or atomic weights had been measured incorrectly, or that there was a missing element yet to be discovered [58] In 1871, Mendeleev published a long article, including an updated form of his table, that made his predictions for unknown elements explicit Mendeleev predicted the properties of three of these unknown elements in detail: as they would be missing heavier homologues of boron, aluminium, and silicon, he named them eka-boron, eka-aluminium, and eka-silicon (\"eka\" being Sanskrit for \"one\") [208] [209]: 45 \nIn 1875, the French chemist Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, working without knowledge of Mendeleev's prediction, discovered a new element in a sample of the mineral sphalerite, and named it gallium He isolated the element and began determining its properties Mendeleev, reading de Boisbaudran's publication, sent a letter claiming that gallium was his predicted eka-aluminium Although Lecoq de Boisbaudran was initially sceptical, and suspected that Mendeleev was trying to take credit for his discovery, he later admitted that Mendeleev was correct [210] In 1879, the Swedish chemist Lars Fredrik Nilson discovered a new element, which he named scandium: it turned out to be eka-boron Eka-silicon was found in 1886 by German chemist Clemens Winkler, who named it germanium The properties of gallium, scandium, and germanium matched what Mendeleev had predicted [211] In 1889, Mendeleev noted at the Faraday Lecture to the Royal Institution in London that he had not expected to live long enough \"to mention their discovery to the Chemical Society of Great Britain as a confirmation of the exactitude and generality of the periodic law\" [212] Even the discovery of the noble gases at the close of the 19th century, which Mendeleev had not predicted, fitted neatly into his scheme as an eighth main group [213]\n\n\nAtomic number\nAfter the internal structure of the atom was probed, amateur Dutch physicist Antonius van den Broek proposed in 1913 that the nuclear charge determined the placement of elements in the periodic table [214] [215] The New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford coined the word \"atomic number\" for this nuclear charge [216] In van den Broek's published article he illustrated the first electronic periodic table showing the elements arranged according to the number of their electrons [217] Rutherford confirmed in his 1914 paper that Bohr had accepted the view of van den Broek [218]\n\n\nElectron shells\nThe Danish physicist Niels Bohr applied Max Planck's idea of quantization to the atom He concluded that the energy levels of electrons were quantised: only a discrete set of stable energy states were allowed Bohr then attempted to understand periodicity through electron configurations, surmising in 1913 that the inner electrons should be responsible for the chemical properties of the element [223] [224] In 1913, he produced the first electronic periodic table based on a quantum atom [225]\n\n\nSynthetic elements\nBy 1936, the pool of missing elements from hydrogen to uranium had shrunk to four: elements 43, 61, 85, and 87 remained missing Element 43 eventually became the first element to be synthesized artificially via nuclear reactions rather than discovered in nature It was discovered in 1937 by Italian chemists Emilio Segrè and Carlo Perrier, who named their discovery technetium, after the Greek word for \"artificial\" [242] Elements 61 (promethium) and 85 (astatine) were likewise produced artificially in 1945 and 1940 respectively; element 87 (francium) became the last element to be discovered in nature, by French chemist Marguerite Perey in 1939 [243] [u] The elements beyond uranium were likewise discovered artificially, starting with Edwin McMillan and Philip Abelson's 1940 discovery of neptunium (via bombardment of uranium with neutrons) [75] Glenn T Seaborg and his team at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) continued discovering transuranium elements, starting with plutonium in 1941, and discovered that contrary to previous thinking, the elements from actinium onwards were congeners of the lanthanides rather than transition metals [244] Bassett (1892), Werner (1905), and the French engineer Charles Janet (1928) had previously suggested this, but their ideas did not then receive general acceptance [33] Seaborg thus called them the actinides [244] Elements up to 101 (named mendelevium in honour of Mendeleev) were synthesized up to 1955, either through neutron or alpha-particle irradiation, or in nuclear explosions in the cases of 99 (einsteinium) and 100 (fermium) [75]\n\n\nFuture extension beyond the seventh period\nThe most recently named elements – nihonium (113), moscovium (115), tennessine (117), and oganesson (118) – completed the seventh row of the periodic table [6] Future elements would have to begin an eighth row These elements may be referred to either by their atomic numbers (e.g \"element 164\"), or by the IUPAC systematic element names adopted in 1978, which directly relate to the atomic numbers (e.g \"unhexquadium\" for element 164, derived from Latin unus \"one\", Greek hexa  \"six\", Latin quadra \"four\", and the traditional -ium suffix for metallic elements) [6] All attempts to synthesize such elements have failed so far An attempt to make element 119 has been ongoing since 2018 at the Riken research institute in Japan The LBNL in the United States, the JINR in Russia, and the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL) in China also plan to make their own attempts at synthesizing the first few period 8 elements [257] [258] [259] [260] [261] [262]\n\n\nAlternative periodic tables\nThe periodic law may be represented in multiple ways, of which the standard periodic table is only one [284] Within 100 years of the appearance of Mendeleev's table in 1869, Edward G Mazurs had collected an estimated 700 different published versions of the periodic table [180] [285] Many forms retain the rectangular structure, including Charles Janet's left-step periodic table (pictured below), and the modernised form of Mendeleev's original 8-column layout that is still common in Russia Other periodic table formats have been shaped much more exotically, such as spirals (Otto Theodor Benfey's pictured to the right), circles and triangles [286]\n\n\nSee

The gold medals were made from 99.9% pure silver, making them purer than any medals presented at all preceding Olympics. The silver medals were made from recycled materials, including mirrors, solder, and X-ray plates.

The reverse of the medals features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory.\n\n## Design and Manufacturing\nThe 2016 Olympic medals were designed by art director Roberto Burle Marx, who was known for his work on the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. The medals were manufactured by the Brazilian Mint, which used advanced technology to produce the medals. The gold medals weighed 250 grams, while the silver medals weighed 250 grams and the bronze medals weighed 250 grams as well.

Some nations experienced a significant increase in their medal count, while others experienced a decline. The changes in the medal standings were due to a variety of factors, including:\n\n* Upset victories in the sports competitions.\n* Changes in the rules and regulations of the sports competitions.\n* The introduction of new sports and events.\n\n## Changes in the Top 10\nThe top 10 nations in the medal standings changed significantly during the 2016 Summer Olympics.

The album was developed from a musical, Neverland, which was a futuristic rock version of Peter Pan written by Jim Steinman in 1974. Steinman and Meat Loaf, who were touring with The National Lampoon Show, felt that three songs were \"exceptional\" and Steinman began to develop them as part of a seven-song set they wanted to record as an album. The three songs were \"Bat Out of Hell\", \"Heaven Can Wait\" and \"The Formation of the Pack\", which was later retitled \"All Revved Up with No Place to Go\".\n\n**Production**\n\nRecording started in late 1975 in Bearsville Studios, Woodstock, New York.

Edgar Winter played the saxophone on \"All Revved Up\". Rundgren himself played guitar, including the \"motorcycle solo\" on \"Bat Out of Hell\". Both Steinman and Rundgren were influenced by Phil Spector and his \"Wall of Sound\". According to Meat Loaf, Rundgren put all the arrangements together because although \"Jim could hear all the instruments\" in his head, Steinman hummed rather than orchestrated.\n\n**Composition**\n\nTodd Rundgren states that Steinman was highly influenced by the \"rural suburban teenage angst\" of Springsteen. According to manager David Sonenberg, \"Jim would always come up with these great titles and then he would write a song that would try to justify the greatness of the title.\"\n\n**Cover**\n\nSteinman is credited with the album cover concept, which was illustrated by Richard Corben.

You could release that record at any time and it would be out of place.\"\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe album was not an immediate hit in the United States. Reviews were initially mixed, but have since become much more positive. On release, Dave Marsh's review in Rolling Stone called the songs \"swell, but... entirely mannered and derivative\" and noted that the arrangements \"aren't bad\", and commended the musicians.

{"title": "Henry_VI_of_England", "content": "\nChild king\nHenry was born on 6 December 1421 at Windsor Castle, the only child and heir-apparent of King Henry V Succeeding to the throne as King of England at the age of eight months on 1 September 1422, the day after his father's death; he remains the youngest person ever to succeed to the English throne [4] On 21 October 1422, in accordance with the Treaty of Troyes of 1420, he became titular King of France upon his grandfather Charles VI's death His mother, the 20-year-old Catherine of Valois, was viewed with considerable suspicion by English nobles as Charles VI's daughter She was prevented from playing a full role in her son's upbringing.\n\n\nAssumption of government\nHenry, who was by nature shy, pious, and averse to deceit and bloodshed, immediately allowed his court to be dominated by a few noble favourites who clashed on the matter of the French war when he assumed the reins of government in 1437 After the death of King Henry V, England had lost momentum in the Hundred Years' War, whereas the House of Valois had gained ground beginning with Joan of Arc's military victories in the year 1429 The young King came to favour a policy of peace in France and thus favoured the faction around Cardinal Beaufort and William de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, who thought likewise; the Duke of Gloucester and Richard, Duke of York, who argued for a continuation of the war, were ignored.\n\n\nMarriage\nAs the English military situation in France deteriorated, talks emerged in England about arranging a marriage for the king to strengthen England's foreign connections [13] and facilitate a peace between the warring parties In 1434, the English council suggested that peace with the Scots could best be effected by the wedding of Henry to one of the daughters of King James I of Scotland;

He was the son of King Henry V and Catherine of Valois, and he became the youngest English monarch in history at the age of eight months.\n\n**Child King**\n\nHenry was born on 6 December 1421 at Windsor Castle, the only child and heir-apparent of King Henry V. Succeeding to the throne as King of England at the age of eight months on 1 September 1422, the day after his father's death; he remains the youngest person ever to succeed to the English throne. On 21 October 1422, in accordance with the Treaty of Troyes of 1420, he became titular King of France upon his grandfather Charles VI's death. His mother, the 20-year-old Catherine of Valois, was viewed with considerable suspicion by English nobles as Charles VI's daughter. She was prevented from playing a full role in her son's upbringing.\n\n**Assumption of Government**\n\nHenry, who was by nature shy, pious, and averse to deceit and bloodshed, immediately allowed his court to be dominated by a few noble favourites who clashed on the matter of the French war when he assumed the reins of government in 1437. After the death of King Henry V, England had lost momentum in the Hundred Years' War, whereas the House of Valois had gained ground beginning with Joan of Arc's military victories in the year 1429. The young King came to favour a policy of peace in France and thus favoured the faction around Cardinal Beaufort and William de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, who thought likewise; the Duke of Gloucester and Richard, Duke of York, who argued for a continuation of the war, were ignored.\n\n**Marriage**\n\nAs the English military situation in France deteriorated, talks emerged in England about arranging a marriage for the king to strengthen England's foreign connections and facilitate a peace between the warring parties. In 1434, the English council suggested that peace with the Scots could best be effected by the wedding of Henry to one of the daughters of King James I of Scotland; the proposal came to nothing. During the Congress of Arras in 1435, the English put forth the idea of a union between Henry and a daughter of King Charles VII of France, but the Armagnacs refused even to contemplate the suggestion unless Henry renounced his claim to the French throne. Another proposal in 1438 to a daughter of King Albert II of Germany likewise failed.\n\n**Ascendancy of Suffolk and Somerset**\n\nIn 1447, the king and queen summoned the Duke of Gloucester to appear before parliament on the charge of treason. Queen Margaret had no tolerance for any sign of disloyalty toward her husband and kingdom, thus any suspicion of this was immediately brought to her attention. This move was instigated by Gloucester's enemies, the earl of Suffolk, whom Margaret held in great esteem, and the ageing Cardinal Beaufort and his nephew, Edmund Beaufort, Earl of Somerset. Gloucester was put in custody in Bury St Edmunds, where he died, probably of a heart attack (although contemporary rumours spoke of poisoning) before he could be tried.\n\n**Illness and the ascendancy of York**\n\nIn 1452, the Duke of York was persuaded to return from Ireland, claim his rightful place on the council, and put an end to bad government. His cause was a popular one and he soon raised an army at Shrewsbury. The court party, meanwhile, raised their own similar-sized force in London. A stand-off took place south of London, with the Duke of York presenting a list of grievances and demands to the court circle, including the arrest of Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset. The king initially agreed, but Margaret intervened to prevent the arrest of Beaufort. By 1453, Somerset's influence had been restored, and York was again isolated. The court party was also strengthened by the announcement that the queen was pregnant.\n\n**Wars of the Roses**\n\nAround Christmas Day 1454, King Henry regained his senses. Disaffected nobles who had grown in power during Henry's reign, most importantly the Earls of Warwick and Salisbury, took matters into their own hands. They backed the claims of the rival House of York, first to the control of government, and then to the throne itself (from 1460), pointing to York's better descent from Edward III. It was agreed that York would become Henry's successor, despite York being older. In 1457, Henry created the Council of Wales and the Marches for his son Prince Edward, and in 1458, he attempted to unite the warring factions by staging the Loveday in London.\n\n**Return to the throne**\n\nQueen Margaret, exiled in Scotland and later in France, was determined to win back the throne on behalf of her husband and her son, Edward of Westminster. By herself, there was little she could do. However, eventually, Edward IV fell out with two of his main supporters: Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, and his own younger brother George, Duke of Clarence. At the urging of King Louis XI of France they formed a secret alliance with Margaret. After marrying his daughter Anne Neville to Henry and Margaret's son, Warwick returned to England, forced Edward IV into exile, and restored Henry VI to the throne on 3 October 1470; the term \"readeption\" is still sometimes used for this event. However, by this time, years in hiding followed by years in captivity had taken their toll on Henry. Warwick and Clarence effectively ruled in his name.\n\n**Imprisonment and death**\n\nHenry was imprisoned in the Tower of London again and, when the royal party arrived in London, he was reported dead. Official chronicles and documents state that the deposed king died on the night of 21 May 1471. In all likelihood, his opponents had kept him alive up to that point, rather than leave the Lancastrians with a far more formidable leader in Henry's son, Edward. However, once the last of the most prominent Lancastrian supporters had been either killed or exiled, it became clear that Henry VI would be a burden on Edward IV's reign. The common fear was the possibility of another noble using the mentally unstable king to further their own agenda.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nOverall, Henry VI is largely seen as a weak, inept king, who did nothing to ease the Wars of the Roses. He is widely believed to have favoured diplomacy, rather than all-out war in the Hundred Years' War, in stark contrast to his father, Henry V, who led the victory at Agincourt. This allowed Henry to be heavily influenced by many nobles, such as William de la Pole, who oversaw significant English losses in France, such as the Siege of Orléans. On the other hand, many historians see Henry as a pious, generous king, who was victim of an unstable crown, caused by the deposition of Richard II. John Blacman, personal chaplain of Henry, described the king as a man without \"any crook or uncouth.\"\n\n**Architecture and education**\n\nHenry's one lasting achievement was his fostering of education: he founded Eton College; King's College, Cambridge; and All Souls College, Oxford. He continued a career of architectural patronage started by his father: King's College Chapel and Eton College Chapel and most of his other architectural commissions (such as his completion of his father's foundation of Syon Abbey) consisted of a late Gothic or Perpendicular-style church with a monastic or educational foundation attached. Each year on the anniversary of Henry VI's death, the Provosts of Eton and King's lay white lilies and roses, the respective floral emblems of those colleges, on the spot in the Wakefield Tower at the Tower of London where the imprisoned Henry VI was, according to tradition, murdered as he knelt at prayer. There is a similar ceremony at his resting place, St George's Chapel.\n\n**Posthumous cult**\n\nMiracles were attributed to Henry, and he was informally regarded as a saint and martyr, addressed particularly in cases of adversity. The anti-Yorkist cult was encouraged by Henry VII of England as dynastic propaganda. A volume was compiled of the miracles attributed to him at St George's Chapel, Windsor, where Richard III had reinterred him, and Henry VII began building a chapel at Westminster Abbey to house Henry VI's relics. A number of Henry VI's miracles possessed a political dimension, such as his cure of a young girl afflicted with the King's evil, whose parents refused to bring her to the usurper, Richard III. By the time of Henry VIII's break with Rome, canonisation proceedings were under way. Hymns to him still exist, and until the Reformation his hat was kept by his tomb at Windsor, where pilgrims would put it on to enlist Henry's aid against migraines.\n\n**In culture**\n\nWilliam Shakespeare and possibly others completed the Henry VI trilogy around 1593, roughly 121 years after the real monarch's death. The period of history covered in the plays was between the funeral of Henry V (1422) to the Battle of Tewkesbury (1471).\n\n**Genealogy**\n\nDukes (except Aquitaine) and Princes of Wales are noted, as are the monarchs' reigns.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Henry_VI_of_England\" following this outline:\n\n\nChild king\nHenry was born on 6 December 1421 at Windsor Castle, the only child and heir-apparent of King Henry V Succeeding to the throne as King of England at the age of eight months on 1 September 1422, the day after his father's death;

The term was adopted as a compromise between the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC) to avoid diplomatic tensions and conflicts. This article explores the origins, usage, and implications of the name \"Chinese Taipei\" in various international settings.\n\n**Origins**\n\nIn the aftermath of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the People's Republic of China (PRC) was established, and the nationalist Republic of China (ROC) government retreated to Taiwan, previously a Qing territory that was ceded to Japanese rule from 1895 until its surrender at the end of World War II in 1945. As time went on, the increased official recognition of the PRC in international activities, such as when accorded recognition in 1971 by the United Nations, instead of that accorded previously to the ROC saw existing diplomatic relations transfer from Taipei to Beijing.\n\nThe ROC needed to come to a beneficial conclusion to how it would be referred when there was participation by the PRC in the same forum. This led to the adoption of the name \"Chinese Taipei\" as a compromise between the two governments.\n\n**Two Chinas at the Olympics**\n\nIn the aftermath of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the People's Republic of China (PRC) was established and the nationalist Republic of China (ROC) government retreated to Taiwan, previously a Qing territory that was ceded to Japanese rule from 1895 until its surrender at the end of World War II in 1945. As time went on, the increased official recognition of the PRC in international activities, such as when accorded recognition in 1971 by the United Nations, instead of that accorded previously to the ROC saw existing diplomatic relations transfer from Taipei to Beijing.\n\nThe ROC needed to come to a beneficial conclusion to how it would be referred when there was participation by the PRC in the same forum. This led to the adoption of the name \"Chinese Taipei\" as a compromise between the two governments.\n\n**1979 IOC Resolutions**\n\nIn April 1979, the IOC recognized the Olympic Committee of the PRC and maintained recognition of the Olympic Committee located in Taipei at the 81st IOC Session held in Montevideo. The resolution left problems relating to the names, anthems, and flags of both committees unsolved. The PRC showed a willingness to allow Taiwan to be included in the IOC but objected to the resolution, reaffirming sports organizations in Taiwan must not use any of the emblems of the Republic of China.\n\nHe Zhenliang, a representative of the PRC, stated in Montevideo, \"We are willing to participate in the Olympic Games, but we insist that the Taiwan question should not be included in the Olympic Program.\" This statement highlighted the tension between the two governments and the need for a compromise.\n\n**1981 Agreement**\n\nIn 1980, the IOC amended the Olympic Charter so that all National Olympic Committees (NOCs) when participating in the Games could use delegation flags and anthems, instead of national ones. Juan Antonio Samaranch, the new president of the IOC, met Henry Hsu several times to discuss the ROC Olympic Committee's status in the IOC.\n\nIn order for the youth to participate in the Olympic Games and counteract the PRC's strategy of isolating the ROC, the ROC government concluded that the ROC Olympic Committee should not withdraw from the IOC. This decision led to the adoption of the name \"Chinese Taipei\" as a compromise between the two governments.\n\n**Translation Compromise**\n\nBoth the Republic of China (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) agree to use the English name \"Chinese Taipei\". The English word \"Chinese\" is ambiguous, and may refer to either the state or the culture. The ROC translates \"Chinese Taipei\" as Zhōnghuá Táiběi (simplified Chinese: 中华台北; traditional Chinese: 中華臺北).\n\nThe term \"Zhonghua\" is also used in the ROC's official name and state-owned enterprises. Meanwhile, the PRC translates the name as Zhōngguó Táiběi (simplified Chinese: 中国台北; traditional Chinese: 中國臺北) or literally \"Taipei, China\", in the same manner as Zhōngguó Xiānggǎng (simplified Chinese: 中国香港; traditional Chinese: 中國香港) (\"Hong Kong, China\").\n\n**Other Languages**\n\nIn French, multiple different names have been officially used. The World Trade Organization officially translates the name as \"Taipei Chinois\", which has an ambiguous meaning. The text of the IOC's Nagoya Resolution in 1979 used the name \"Taipei de Chine\" suggesting the state meaning of \"Chinese\".\n\nBefore signing the agreement between the IOC and the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee in 1981, representatives of two committees decided that the French name need not be stated. Only the English name would be used in the future IOC official documents.\n\n**Use of the Name**\n\nBesides the International Olympic Committee and sports organizations, Taiwan is a member economy of APEC and its official name in the organization is \"Chinese Taipei\". Taiwan's name in the World Trade Organization, \"Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu\", is frequently abbreviated as Chinese Taipei.\n\nIt also participated as an invited guest in the World Health Organization (WHO) under the name of Chinese Taipei. The WHO is the only agency of the United Nations that the ROC is able, provided it is invited each year, to participate in since 1971.\n\n**International Organizations and Forums**\n\nBesides the International Olympic Committee and sports organizations, Taiwan is a member economy of APEC and its official name in the organization is \"Chinese Taipei\". Taiwan's name in the World Trade Organization, \"Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu\", is frequently abbreviated as Chinese Taipei.\n\nIt also participated as an invited guest in the World Health Organization (WHO) under the name of Chinese Taipei.

The title \"Chinese Taipei\" has been described as confusing, as it leads some people to believe that \"Taipei\" is a country or that it is located in or governed by mainland China.\n\nTaiwanese Olympian Chi Cheng has described competing under the name as \"aggravating, humiliating, and depressing.\" This sentiment reflects the complex emotions and tensions surrounding the use of the name \"Chinese Taipei\" in Taiwan.\n\n**2017 Summer Universiade**\n\nUse of the label came under vigorous renewed criticism during the run-up to the 2017 Summer Universiade, hosted in Taiwan. An English-language guide to the Universiade was lambasted for its \"absurd\" use of the label.\n\nThe guide was rendered nonsensically by completely avoiding the name \"Taiwan\" not only when referring to the label under which Taiwanese athletes compete, but even when referring to geographical features such as the island of Taiwan itself. These statements included \"Introduction of our Island: .. Chinese Taipei is long and narrow that lies north to south\", and \"Chinese Taipei is a special island and its Capital Taipei is a great place to experience Taipei's culture.\"\n\n**2018 Referendum**\n\nIn February 2018, an alliance of civic organizations submitted a proposal to Taiwan's Central Election Commission (CEC). The proposed referendum asks if the nation should apply under the name of \"Taiwan\" for all international sports events, including the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nThe proposal influenced the East Asian Olympic Committee (EAOC) to revoke Taichung's right to host the first East Asian Youth Games due to \"political factors\". An International Olympic Committee (IOC) representative reportedly said this was entirely the decision of the EAOC, and the IOC had no role in the ruling.\n\n**Other Alternative References to Taiwan**\n\nThe terminology used to refer to the Republic of China has varied according to the geopolitical situation. Initially, the Republic of China was known simply as \"China\" until 1971, when the People's Republic of China replaced the Republic of China as the exclusive legitimate representative of \"China\" at the United Nations.\n\nIn order to distinguish the Republic of China from the People's Republic of China, there has been a growing current of support for the use of \"Taiwan\" in place of \"China\" to refer to the former.\n\n**Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu**\n\nIn the World Trade Organization, the official full name of Taiwan is \"Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu\", while its official short name is \"Chinese Taipei\".\n\n**Taiwan, Province of China**\n\nInternational organizations in which the PRC participates generally do not recognize Taiwan or allow its membership. Thus, for example, whenever the United Nations makes reference to Taiwan, which does not appear on its member countries list, it uses the designation \"Taiwan, Province of China\".\n\n**Island of Taiwan/Formosa**\n\nThe term island of Taiwan or Formosa is used sometimes to avoid any misunderstanding about the Taiwan independence movement just referring to the island.\n\n**China or Republic of China**\n\nSome non-governmental organizations which the PRC does not participate in continue to use \"China\" or the \"Republic of China\". The World Organization of the Scout Movement is one of the few international organizations that continue to use the name of \"Republic of China\", and the ROC affiliate as the Scouts of China.\n\n**Governing Authorities on Taiwan**\n\nThe United States uses the term \"governing authorities on Taiwan\" in the Taiwan Relations Act, officially defining the term \"Taiwan\" to \"include...the islands of Taiwan and the Pescadores...and the governing authorities on Taiwan recognized by the United States as the Republic of China prior to January 1, 1979.\"", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Chinese_Taipei\" following this outline:\n\n\nOrigins\nIn the aftermath of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the People's Republic of China (PRC) was established and the nationalist Republic of China (ROC) government retreated to Taiwan, previously a Qing territory that was ceded to Japanese rule from 1895 until its surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 [16] [17] As time went on, the increased official recognition of the PRC in international activities, such as when accorded recognition in 1971 by the United Nations, instead of that accorded previously to the ROC saw existing diplomatic relations transfer from Taipei to Beijing [18] The ROC needed to come to a beneficial conclusion to how it would be referred when there was participation by the PRC in the same forum [19]\n\n\nTwo Chinas at the Olympics\nIn the aftermath of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the People's Republic of China (PRC) was established and the nationalist Republic of China (ROC) government retreated to Taiwan, previously a Qing territory that was ceded to Japanese rule from 1895 until its surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 [16] [17] As time went on, the increased official recognition of the PRC in international activities, such as when accorded recognition in 1971 by the United Nations, instead of that accorded previously to the ROC saw existing diplomatic relations transfer from Taipei to Beijing [18] The ROC needed to come to a beneficial conclusion to how it would be referred when there was participation by the PRC in the same forum [19]\n\n\n1979 IOC resolutions\nIn April 1979, the IOC recognized the Olympic Committee of the PRC and maintained recognition of the Olympic Committee located in Taipei at the 81st IOC Session held in Montevideo [28] [29] The resolution left problems relating to the names, anthems and flags of both committees unsolved The PRC showed a willingness to allow Taiwan to be included in the IOC but objected to the resolution, reaffirming sports organizations in Taiwan must not use any of the emblems of the Republic of China [20] He Zhenliang, a representative of the PRC, stated in Montevideo:\n\n\n1981 agreement\nIn 1980, the IOC amended the Olympic Charter so that all National Olympic Committees (NOCs) when participating in the Games could use delegation flags and anthems, instead of national ones [27] [36] Juan Antonio Samaranch, the new president of the IOC, met Henry Hsu several times to discuss the ROC Olympic Committee's status in the IOC In order for the youth to participate in the Olympic Games and counteract the PRC's strategy of isolating the ROC, the ROC government concluded that the ROC Olympic Committee should not withdraw from the IOC.\n\n\nTranslation compromise\nBoth the Republic of China (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) agree to use the English name \"Chinese Taipei\" The English word \"Chinese\" is ambiguous, and may refer to either the state or the culture The ROC translates \"Chinese Taipei\" as Zhōnghuá Táiběi (simplified Chinese: 中华台北;

attitude\n\nFederer was noted for his cool demeanor and emotional control on the court Most of his professional game has been characterized by a lack of outbursts or emotional frustration at errors, giving him an advantage over less controlled opponents [377] [378] [379] In 2016, Federer declared: \n\nCoaches\nFrom ages 8 to 10, Federer received group and individual training from veteran Czech coach Adolf Kacovsky [17] Reflecting on Federer, Kacovsky said \"The private lessons, which were partly funded by the club Roger was a quick learner When you wanted to teach him something new, he was able to pick it up after three or four tries, while others in the group needed weeks\" [17] At age 10, Federer began working with Peter Carter Between the ages of 10 and 14, Federer spent more time with Carter than with his own family, working daily on all aspects of his game Building on the work done earlier by Kacovsky, Carter helped perfect Federer's technique, along with teaching him the strategy and psychology required to play the game to a high level [17] Federer has credited Carter for his \"entire technique and coolness\" [17]\n\n\nEquipment\nFederer began the 2014 season by changing rackets for the first time in his career He switched from his longtime frame of 90 square inches to one measured at 97 square inches He had long been at a comparative disadvantage in

signature Wilson Pro Staff RF97 Autograph racquet It had a 97 square inch head, 16x19 string pattern, 366 gram strung weight, 340 gram swing weight, 68 RA stiffness, and 9 point head light balance

updated the next year with four racquets after he won the Championship in 2006 [396] At Wimbledon 2008, and again in 2009, Nike continued this trend by making him a personalised cardigan that also had his own logo, an R and an F joined, [397] [398] which was originally designed by his wife, Mirka [399]\n\n\nOff the court\nFederer has been nicknamed the \"Federer Express\" (shortened to \"Fed

[447]\n\n\nCharitable work\nAt the 2005 Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells, Federer arranged an exhibition with several top players from the ATP and WTA tour called Rally for Relief, whose proceeds

How unorthodox!\" [175] Roger Ebert gave the films mostly positive reviews but criticized them for the amount of mutants, stating \"their powers are so various and ill-matched that it's hard to keep them all on the same canvas\" [176]\n\n\nLegacy\nRichard George of IGN stated that the success of the first X-Men film paved the way for comic-book film adaptations such as the Spider-Man series, Fantastic Four (2005), V for Vendetta and Singer's Superman Returns [184] Chris Hewitt of Empire magazine called the first X-Men film as the \"catalyst\" for films based on Marvel Comics characters, stating \"Singer's 2000 film is the catalyst for everything that's come since, good and bad Without it, there's no Marvel Studios.\" [229] Comic-book writer Mark Millar said that Singer's X-Men \"revolutionized\" superhero films [230]\n\n\nMusic\nAs of May 2014, the DVD and Blu-ray sales of the first six films in the United States earned more than $620 million [246]\n\n\nSoundtracks\nAs of May 2014, the DVD and Blu-ray sales of the first six films in the United States earned more than $620 million [246]\n\n\nHome media\nAs of May 2014, the DVD and Blu-ray sales of the first six films in the United States earned more than $620 million [246]\n\n\nCanceled or reworked projects\nIn March 2019, The Walt Disney Company gained film and television rights to the X-Men after the acquisition of 21st Century Fox was completed [247] The films in development under 20th Century Fox were placed \"on hold\" [248] and eventually canceled by Disney Any future X-Men projects would be produced by Marvel Studios, and the characters would be integrated into the Marvel Cinematic Universe [249] [250] Future films based on the X-Men franchise planned by Fox before the acquisition included:\n\n\nMarvel Cinematic Universe\nIn March 2019, Marvel Studios regained the film rights to the X-Men, along with the Fantastic Four and Deadpool, after its parent company Disney acquired Fox; they are planned to be integrated into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) In October 2020, the films in the X-Men series, along with the Fantastic Four films, were rebranded as \"Marvel Legacy films\" on Disney+ [307] In WandaVision (2021), Evan Peters appeared as a character named Ralph Bohner who poses as Wanda Maximoff's deceased twin brother Pietro, a reference to his role in the X-Men series as Peter Maximoff [308] Patrick Stewart reprised his role as an alternate Charles Xavier / Professor X in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022) [309] Kelsey Grammer reprised his role as Hank McCoy / Beast in The Marvels (2023) [310] A new film featuring the team, which will reboot the franchise for the MCU, entered the early stages of development in September 2023 [311]\n\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine (2024)\nThe MCU film Deadpool & Wolverine (2024), the sequel to the X-Men films Deadpool (2016) and Deadpool 2 (2018) and a follow-up to Logan (2017), integrated the series' iteration of Wade Wilson / Deadpool, reprised by Ryan Reynolds, and an alternate version of Hugh Jackman's Logan / Wolverine, into the continuity of the MCU, while serving as a send-off for the original franchise [312] Also reprising their roles from the previous Deadpool films are Karan Soni, Leslie Uggams, Morena Baccarin, Stefan Kapičić, Rob Delaney, Brianna Hildebrand, Lewis Tan and Shioli Kutsuna reprised their roles as Dopinder and Blind Al, Vanessa Carlysle, Colossus, Peter Wisdom, Negasonic Teenage Warhead, Shatterstar and Yukio [313] [314] [315] Several other actors reprised their roles as characters who were exiled from the original series' universe into the Void, including Aaron Stanford as John Allerdyce / Pyro, Dafne Keen as Laura / X-23, and Tyler Mane as Victor Creed / Sabretooth, [316] [317] as well as the characters Azazel, Juggernaut, Lady Deathstrike, Psylocke, Toad, Callisto, Arclight, and Blob Additionally, the film's credits feature a tribute to the original franchise in the form of a montage of clips, behind-the-scenes footage and the 20th Century Fox logo set to \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" by Green Day [318]\n\n\nNotes\n Category\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

franchise in the 19th century forced the Conservative Party to popularise its approach under Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby and Benjamin Disraeli, who carried through their own expansion of the franchise with the Reform Act of 1867 The party was initially opposed to further expansion of the electorate but eventually allowed passage of Gladstone's 1884 Reform Act In 1886, the party formed an alliance with Spencer Cavendish and Joseph Chamberlain's new Liberal Unionist Party and, under the statesmen Robert Gascoyne-Cecil and Arthur Balfour, held power for all but three of the following twenty years before suffering a heavy defeat in 1906 when it split over the issue of free trade.\n\n\nFirst World War\nWhile the Liberals were mostly against the war until the invasion of Belgium, Conservative leaders were strongly in favour of aiding France and stopping Germany The Liberal party was in full control of the government until its mismanagement of the war effort under the Shell Crisis badly hurt its reputation An all-party coalition government was formed in May 1915 In late 1916 Liberal David Lloyd George became prime minister but the Liberals soon split and the Conservatives dominated the government, especially after their landslide in the 1918 election The Liberal party never recovered, but Labour gained strength after 1920 [68]\n\n\n1920–1945\nIn 1922, Bonar Law and Stanley Baldwin led the breakup of the coalition, and the Conservatives governed until 1923, when a minority Labour government led by Ramsay MacDonald came to power The Conservatives regained power in 1924 but were defeated in 1929 as a minority Labour government took office In 1931, following the collapse of the Labour minority government, it entered another coalition, which was dominated by the Conservatives with some support from factions of both the Liberal Party and the Labour Party (National Labour and National Liberals) [71] In May 1940 a more balanced coalition was formed [71]—the National Government—which, under the leadership of Winston Churchill, saw the United Kingdom through the Second World War However, the party lost the 1945 general election in a landslide to the resurgent Labour Party [72] [73]\n\n\n1945–1975: Post-war consensus\nWhile serving in Opposition during the late 1940s, the Conservative Party exploited and incited growing public anger at food rationing, scarcity, controls, austerity, and government bureaucracy It used the dissatisfaction with the socialist and egalitarian policies of the Labour Party to rally middle-class supporters and build a political comeback that won them the 1951 general election [75]\n\n\nPopular dissatisfaction\nWhile serving in Opposition during the late 1940s, the Conservative Party exploited and incited growing public anger at food rationing, scarcity, controls, austerity, and government bureaucracy It used the dissatisfaction with the socialist and egalitarian policies of the Labour Party to rally middle-class supporters and build a political comeback that won them the 1951 general election [75]\n\n\nModernising the party\nIn 1947, the party published its Industrial Charter which marked its acceptance of the \"post-war consensus\" on the mixed economy and labour rights [76] David Maxwell Fyfe chaired a committee into Conservative Party organisation that resulted in the Maxwell Fyfe Report (1948–49) The report required the party to do more fundraising, by forbidding constituency associations from demanding large donations from candidates, with the intention of broadening the diversity of MPs In practice, it may have had the effect of lending more power to constituency parties and making candidates more uniform [77] Winston Churchill, the party leader, brought in a Party chairman to modernise the party: Frederick Marquis, 1st Earl of Woolton rebuilt the local organisations with an emphasis on membership, money, and a unified national propaganda appeal on critical issues [78]\n\n\n1965–1975: Edward Heath\nEdward Heath's 1970–74 government was known for taking the UK into the EEC, although the right-wing of the party objected to his failure to control the trade unions at a time when a declining British industry saw many strikes, as well as the 1973–75 recession Since accession to the EEC, which developed into the EU, British membership has been a source of heated debate within the party.\n\n\n1975–1990: Margaret Thatcher\nLoss of power weakened Heath's control over the party and Margaret Thatcher deposed him in the 1975 leadership election Thatcher led her party to victory at the 1979 general election with a manifesto which concentrated on the party's philosophy [88]\n\n\n1990–1997: John Major\nJohn Major won the party leadership election on 27 November 1990, and his appointment led to an almost immediate boost in Conservative Party fortunes [97] The election was held on 9 April 1992 and the Conservatives won a fourth successive electoral victory, contrary to predictions from opinion polls [98] [99] The Conservatives became the first party to attract 14 million votes in a general election [100] [101]\n\n\n1997–2010: Political wilderness\nMajor resigned as party leader and was succeeded by William Hague [108] The 2001 general election resulted in a net gain of one seat for the Conservative Party and returned a mostly unscathed Labour Party back to government [109] This all occurred months after the fuel protests of September 2000 had seen the Conservatives briefly take a narrow lead over Labour in the opinion polls [110]\n\n\n2010–2024: Austerity, Brexit, and the pandemic\nIn May 2010 the Conservative Party came to government, first under a coalition with the Liberal Democrats and later as a series of majority and minority governments During this period there were five Conservative Prime Ministers: David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, and Rishi Sunak The initial period of this time, primarily under the premiership of David Cameron, was marked by the ongoing effects of the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the implementation of austerity measures in response From 2015 the predominant political event was the Brexit referendum and the process to implement the decision to leave the trade bloc.\n\n\n2010–2016: David Cameron\nThe 2010 election resulted in a hung parliament with the Conservatives having the most seats but short of an overall majority [133] Following the resignation of Gordon Brown, Cameron was named Prime Minister, and the Conservatives entered government in a coalition with the Liberal Democrats—the first postwar coalition government [134] [135]\n\n\n2016–2019: Theresa May\nOn 11 July 2016, Theresa May became the leader of the Conservative Party [144] May promised social reform and a more centrist political outlook for the Conservative Party and its government [145] May's early cabinet appointments were interpreted as an effort to reunite the party in the wake of the UK's vote to leave the European Union [146]\n\n\n2019–2022: Boris Johnson\nIn July 2019 Boris Johnson became Leader of the party [153] He became Prime Minister the next day Johnson had made withdrawal from the EU by 31 October \"with no ifs, buts or maybes\" a key pledge during his campaign for party leadership [154]\n\n\n2022: Liz Truss\nBoris Johnson's successor as leader was confirmed as Liz Truss on 5 September, following a leadership election [167] In a strategy labelled Trussonomics she introduced policies in response to the cost of living crisis, [168] including price caps on energy bills and government help to pay them [169] Truss's mini-budget on 23 September faced severe criticism and markets reacted poorly; [170] the pound fell to a record low of 1.03 against the dollar, and UK government gilt yields rose to 4.3 per cent, prompting the Bank of England to trigger an emergency bond-buying programme [171] [172] After condemnation from the public, the Labour Party and her own party, Truss reversed some aspects of the mini-budget, including the abolition of the top rate of income tax [173] [174] Following a government crisis Truss announced her resignation as prime minister on 20 October [175] after 44 days in office, the shortest premiership in British history [175] [176] Truss also oversaw the worst polling the Conservatives had ever received, with Labour polling as high as 36 per cent above the Conservatives amidst the crisis [177]\n\n\n2022–2024: Rishi Sunak\nOn 24 October 2022, Rishi Sunak was declared Leader, the first British Asian Leader of the Conservatives and the first British Asian Prime Minister On 22 May Sunak announced a general election to be held on 4 July 2024 [178]\n\n\n2024: Kemi Badenoch\nOn 2 November 2024 Kemi Badenoch was elected as the leader of the Conservatives after the party's significant election defeat, ending 14 years in power She secured 57% of nearly 100,000 votes against Robert Jenrick, succeeding Rishi Sunak In her victory speech, Badenoch acknowledged past mistakes and called for honesty and renewal With a background in business and software engineering, she promotes low taxes and free-market policies [185]\n\n\nPolicies\nDefunct\n\n\nEconomic policy\nDefunct\n\n\nSocial policy\nSocially conservative policies such as tax incentives for married couples may have played a role in the party's electoral decline in the 1990s and early 2000s, and so the party has attempted to seek a new direction As part of their coalition with the Liberal Democrats, the Conservative government did support the introduction of equal marriage rights for LGBT+ individuals in 2010, though 139 Conservative MPs, a majority, voted against the 2013 same-sex marriage act Thus the extent to which this policy represented a more liberal Conservative party has been challenged [198]\n\n\nForeign policy\nFor much of the 20th century, the Conservative Party took a broadly Atlanticist stance in relations with the United States, Members of EU and NATO, favouring close ties with the United States and similarly aligned nations such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Japan The Conservatives have generally favoured a diverse range of international alliances, ranging from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to the Commonwealth of Nations The Conservatives have proposed a Pan-African Free Trade Area, which it says could help entrepreneurial dynamism of African people [216] The Conservatives pledged to increase aid spending to 0.7% of national income by 2013 [216] They met this pledge in 2014, when spending on aid reached 0.72% of GDP and the commitment was enshrined in UK law in 2015 [217]\n\n\nDefence policy\nAfter the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the Conservative Party supported the coalition military action in Afghanistan The Conservative Party believed that success in Afghanistan would be defined in terms of the Afghans achieving the capability to maintain their own internal and external security They have repeatedly criticised the former Labour Government for failing to equip British Forces adequately in the earlier days on the campaign—especially highlighting the shortage of helicopters for British Forces resulting from Gordon Brown's £1.4bn cut to the helicopter budget in 2004 [233]\n\n\nHealth and drug policy\nIn 1945 the Conservatives declared support for universal healthcare [238] They introduced the Health and Social Care Act 2012, constituting the biggest reformation that the NHS has ever undertaken [239]\n\n\nEducation and research\nIn education, the Conservatives pledged to review the National Curriculum, introduce the English Baccalaureate, and reform GCSE, A-level, other national qualifications, apprenticeships and training [244] The restoration of discipline was also highlighted, as they want it to be easier for pupils to be searched for contraband items, the granting of anonymity to teachers accused by pupils, and the banning of expelled pupils being returned to schools via appeal panels.\n\n\nFamily policy\nAs prime minister, David Cameron wanted to 'support family life in Britain' and put families at the centre of domestic social policymaking [249] He stated in 2014 that there was 'no better place to start' in the Conservative mission of 'building society from the bottom up' than the family, which was responsible for individual welfare and well-being long before the welfare state came into play [249] He also argued that 'family and politics are inextricably linked' [249] Both Cameron and Theresa May aimed at helping families achieve a work-home balance and have previously proposed to offer all parents 12 months parental leave, to be shared by parents as they choose [250] This policy is now in place, offering 50 weeks total parental leave, of which 37 weeks are paid leave, which can be shared between both parents [251]\n\n\nJobs and welfare policy\nOne of the Conservatives' key policy goals in 2010 was to reduce the number of people unemployed, and increase the number of people in the workforce, by strengthening apprenticeships, skills and job training [254] Between 2010 and 2014, all claimants of Incapacity Benefit were moved onto a new benefit scheme, Employment and Support Allowance, which was then subsumed into the Universal Credit system alongside other welfare benefits in 2018 [255] [256] [257] The Universal Credit system came under immense scrutiny following its introduction Shortly after her appointment to the Department for Work and Pensions, the then Secretary of State Amber Rudd acknowledged there were real problems with the Universal Credit system, especially the wait times for initial payments and the housing payments aspect of the combined benefits [258] Rudd pledged specifically to review and address the uneven impact of Universal Credit implementation on economically disadvantaged women, which had been the subject of numerous reports by the Radio 4 You and Yours programme and others [258]\n\n\nEnergy and climate change policy\nDavid Cameron brought several 'green' issues to the forefront of his 2010 campaign These included proposals designed to impose a tax on workplace car parking spaces, a halt to airport growth, a tax on cars with exceptionally poor petrol mileage, and restrictions on car advertising Many of these policies were implemented in the Coalition—including the 'Green Deal' [263] A law was passed in 2019, that UK greenhouse gas emissions will be net zero by 2050 [264] The UK was the first major economy to embrace a legal obligation to achieve net zero carbon emissions [265]\n\n\nJustice, crime and security policy\nIn 2010 the Conservatives campaigned to cut the perceived bureaucracy of the modern police force and pledged greater legal protection to people convicted of defending themselves against intruders.\n\n\nTransport and infrastructure policy\nThe Conservatives have invested in public transport and infrastructure, aimed to promoting economic growth [270] This has included rail (including high-speed rail), electric vehicles, bus networks, and active transport [271]\n\n\nEuropean Union policy\nNo subject has proved more divisive in the Conservative Party in recent history than the role of the United Kingdom within the European Union Though the principal architect of the UK's entry into the European Communities (which became the European Union) was Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath, most contemporary Conservative opinion is opposed to closer economic and particularly political union with the EU This is a noticeable shift in British politics, as in the 1960s and 1970s the Conservatives were more pro-Europe than the Labour Party: for example, in the 1971 House of Commons vote on whether the UK should join the European Economic Community, only 39 of the then 330 Conservative MPs were opposed [278] [279]\n\n\nConstitutional policy\nTraditionally the Conservative Party has supported the uncodified constitution of the United Kingdom and its traditional Westminster system of politics The party opposed many of Tony Blair's reforms, such as the removal of the hereditary peers, [280] the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into British law, and the 2009 creation of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, a function formerly carried out by the House of Lords.\n\n\nOrganisation\nThe Conservative Party comprises the voluntary party, parliamentary party (sometimes called the political party) and the professional party.\n\n\nParty structure\nThe Conservative Party comprises the voluntary party, parliamentary party (sometimes called the political party) and the professional party.\n\n\nMembership\nMembership peaked in the mid-1950s at approximately 3 million, before declining steadily through the second half of the 20th century [287] Despite an initial boost shortly after David Cameron's election as leader in December 2005, membership resumed its decline in 2006 to a lower level than when he was elected In 2010 the Conservative Party had about 177,000 members according to activist Tim Montgomerie, [288] and in 2013 membership was estimated by the party itself at 134,000 [289] The Conservative Party had a membership of 124,000 in March 2018 [290] In May 2019 its membership was thought to be around 160,000, with over half of its members being over 55 [291] [292] Its membership rose to 200,000 in March 2021 [293] In July 2022 it had 172,437 members [294]\n\n\nProspective parliamentary candidates\nAssociations select their constituency's candidates [283] [295] Some associations have organised open parliamentary primaries A constituency Association must choose a candidate using the rules approved by, and (in England, Wales and Northern Ireland) from a list established by, the Committee on Candidates of the Board of the Conservative Party [296] Prospective candidates apply to the Conservative Central Office to be included on the approved list of candidates, some candidates will be given the option of applying for any seat they choose, while others may be restricted to certain constituencies [297] [298] A Conservative MP can only be deselected at a special general meeting of the local Conservative association, which can only be organised if backed by a petition of more than fifty members [297]\n\n\nYoung Conservatives\nYoung Conservatives is the youth wing of the Conservative Party for members aged 25 and under The organisation aims to increase youth ownership and engagement in local associations [299] From 1998 to 2015, the youth wing was called Conservative Future, and had branches at universities and at parliamentary constituency level It was shut down in 2015 after allegations that bullying by Mark Clarke had caused the suicide of Elliot Johnson, a 21-year-old party activist [300] [301] [302] The current incarnation was launched in March 2018.\n\n\nConferences\nThe major annual party events are the Spring Forum and the Conservative Party Conference, which takes place in Autumn in alternately Manchester or Birmingham This is when the National Conservative Convention holds meetings.\n\n\nFunding\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, half the party's funding came from a cluster of fifty \"donor groups\", and a third of it from only fifteen [303] In the year after the 2010 general election, half the Conservatives' funding came from the financial sector [304]\n\n\nFinancial ties to Russian oligarchs\nThe Conservative Party has received funding from Russian oligarchs, beginning in the early 2000s, for which it has been criticised [310] [311] Scrutiny became more prominent after alleged interference in the 2016 Brexit referendum by the Kremlin to support the Vote Leave campaign, and increased after the Intelligence and Security Committee Russia report into Russian interference in British politics was published in July 2020 Concerns over Conservative Party funds have become increasingly controversial due to Vladimir Putin's human rights abuses and the Russian invasion of Ukraine [312]\n\n\nInternational organisations\nThe Conservative Party is a member of a number of international organisations, most notably the International Democracy Union which unites right-wing parties including the United States Republican Party, the Liberal Party of Australia, the Conservative Party of Canada and the South Korean People Power Party.\n\n\nLogo\nWhen Sir Christopher Lawson was appointed as a marketing director at Conservative Central Office in 1981, he developed a logo design based on the Olympic flame in the colours of the Union Jack, [320] which was intended to represent leadership, striving to win, dedication, and a sense of community [321] The emblem was adopted for the 1983 general election [320] In 1989, the party's director of communications, Brendan Bruce, found through market research that recognition of the symbol was low and that people found it old fashioned and uninspiring Using a design company headed by Michael Peters, an image of a hand carrying a torch was developed, which referenced the Statue of Liberty [322]\n\n\nParty factions\nThe Conservative Party has a variety of internal factions or ideologies, including one-nation conservatism, [327] [328] Christian democracy, [329] social conservatism, Thatcherism, traditional conservatism, neoconservatism, [330] [331] Euroscepticism, [332] and, since 2016, right-wing populism [23] [333]\n\n\nOne-nation Conservatives\nOne-nation conservatism was the party's dominant ideology in the 20th century until the rise of Thatcherism in the 1970s It has included in its ranks Conservative Prime Ministers such as Stanley Baldwin, Harold Macmillan and Edward Heath [334] One-nation Conservatives in the contemporary party include former First Secretary of State Damian Green, the current chair of the One Nation Conservatives caucus.\n\n\nFree-market Conservatives\nThe \"free-market wing\" of economic liberals achieved dominance after the election of Margaret Thatcher as party leader in 1975 Their goal was to reduce the role of the government in the economy and to this end, they supported cuts in direct taxation, the privatisation of nationalised industries and a reduction in the size and scope of the welfare state Supporters of the \"free-market wing\" have been labelled as \"Thatcherites\" The group has disparate views of social policy: Thatcher herself was socially conservative and a practising Anglican but the free-market wing in the Conservative Party harbour a range of social opinions from the civil libertarian views of Michael Portillo, Daniel Hannan, and David Davis to the traditional conservatism of former party leaders William Hague and Iain Duncan Smith The Thatcherite wing is also associated with the concept of a \"classless society\" [336]\n\n\nTraditionalist Conservatives\nThis socially conservative right-wing grouping is currently associated with the Cornerstone Group (or Faith, Flag and Family), and is the oldest tradition within the Conservative Party, closely associated with High Toryism The name stems from its support for three social institutions: the Church of England, the unitary British state and the family To this end, it emphasises the country's Anglican heritage, oppose any transfer of power away from the United Kingdom—either downwards to the nations and regions or upwards to the European Union—and seek to place greater emphasis on traditional family structures to repair what it sees as a broken society in the UK It is a strong advocate of marriage and believes the Conservative Party should back the institution with tax breaks and have opposed the alleged assaults on both traditional family structures and fatherhood [339]\n\n\nRelationships between the factions\nSometimes two groupings have united to oppose the third Both Thatcherite and traditionalist Conservatives rebelled over Europe (and in particular Maastricht) during John Major's premiership; and traditionalist and One Nation MPs united to inflict Margaret Thatcher's only major defeat in Parliament, over Sunday trading.\n\n\nElectoral performance and campaigns\nNational campaigning within the Conservative Party is fundamentally managed by the CCHQ campaigning team, which is part of its central office [341]\nHowever, it also delegates local responsibility to Conservative associations in the area, usually to a team of Conservative activists and volunteers [341] in that area, but campaigns are still deployed from and thus managed by CCHQ\nNational campaigning sometimes occurs in-house by volunteers and staff at CCHQ in Westminster [342]\n\n\nUK general election results\nThis chart shows the electoral performance of the Conservative Party in each general election since 1835 [344]

From about 1812, the name \"Tory\" was commonly used for a new party that, according to historian Robert Blake, \"are the ancestors of Conservatism\". Blake adds that Pitt's successors after 1812 \"were not in any sense standard-bearers of 'true Toryism'\".\n\n**1867–1914: Conservatives and Unionists**\n\nThe widening of the electoral franchise in the 19th century forced the Conservative Party to popularise its approach under Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby and Benjamin Disraeli, who carried through their own expansion of the franchise with the Reform Act of 1867. The party was initially opposed to further expansion of the electorate but eventually allowed passage of Gladstone's 1884 Reform Act. In 1886, the party formed an alliance with Spencer Cavendish and Joseph Chamberlain's new Liberal Unionist Party and, under the statesmen Robert Gascoyne-Cecil and Arthur Balfour, held power for all but three of the following twenty years before suffering a heavy defeat in 1906 when it split over the issue of free trade.\n\n**First World War**\n\nWhile the Liberals were mostly against the war until the invasion of Belgium, Conservative leaders were strongly in favour of aiding France and stopping Germany. The Liberal party was in full control of the government until its mismanagement of the war effort under the Shell Crisis badly hurt its reputation. An all-party coalition government was formed in May 1915. In late 1916 Liberal David Lloyd George became prime minister but the Liberals soon split and the Conservatives dominated the government, especially after their landslide in the 1918 election. The Liberal party never recovered, but Labour gained strength after 1920.\n\n**1920–1945**\n\nIn 1922, Bonar Law and Stanley Baldwin led the breakup of the coalition, and the Conservatives governed until 1923, when a minority Labour government led by Ramsay MacDonald came to power. The Conservatives regained power in 1924 but were defeated in 1929 as a minority Labour government took office. In 1931, following the collapse of the Labour minority government, it entered another coalition, which was dominated by the Conservatives with some support from factions of both the Liberal Party and the Labour Party (National Labour and National Liberals). In May 1940 a more balanced coalition was formed – the National Government – which, under the leadership of Winston Churchill, saw the United Kingdom through the Second World War. However, the party lost the 1945 general election in a landslide to the resurgent Labour Party.\n\n**1945–1975: Post-war consensus**\n\nWhile serving in Opposition during the late 1940s, the Conservative Party exploited and incited growing public anger at food rationing, scarcity, controls, austerity, and government bureaucracy. It used the dissatisfaction with the socialist and egalitarian policies of the Labour Party to rally middle-class supporters and build a political comeback that won them the 1951 general election. In 1947, the party published its Industrial Charter which marked its acceptance of the \"post-war consensus\" on the mixed economy and labour rights. David Maxwell Fyfe chaired a committee into Conservative Party organisation that resulted in the Maxwell Fyfe Report (1948–49). The report required the party to do more fundraising, by forbidding constituency associations from demanding large donations from candidates, with the intention of broadening the diversity of MPs.\n\n**1965–1975: Edward Heath**\n\nEdward Heath's 1970–74 government was known for taking the UK into the EEC, although the right-wing of the party objected to his failure to control the trade unions at a time when a declining British industry saw many strikes, as well as the 1973–75 recession. Since accession to the EEC, which developed into the EU, British membership has been a source of heated debate within the party.\n\n**1975–1990: Margaret Thatcher**\n\nLoss of power weakened Heath's control over the party and Margaret Thatcher deposed him in the 1975 leadership election. Thatcher led her party to victory at the 1979 general election with a manifesto which concentrated on the party's philosophy.\n\n**1990–1997: John Major**\n\nJohn Major won the party leadership election on 27 November 1990, and his appointment led to an almost immediate boost in Conservative Party fortunes. The election was held on 9 April 1992 and the Conservatives won a fourth successive electoral victory, contrary to predictions from opinion polls.\n\n**1997–2010: Political wilderness**\n\nMajor resigned as party leader and was succeeded by William Hague. The 2001 general election resulted in a net gain of one seat for the Conservative Party and returned a mostly unscathed Labour Party back to government. This all occurred months after the fuel protests of September 2000 had seen the Conservatives briefly take a narrow lead over Labour in the opinion polls.\n\n**2010–2024: Austerity, Brexit, and the pandemic**\n\nIn May 2010 the Conservative Party came to government, first under a coalition with the Liberal Democrats and later as a series of majority and minority governments. During this period there were five Conservative Prime Ministers: David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, and Rishi Sunak. The initial period of this time, primarily under the premiership of David Cameron, was marked by the ongoing effects of the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the implementation of austerity measures in response.\n\n**Policies**\n\nThe Conservative Party has a wide range of policies, including economic, social, and environmental policies. Some of the party's key policies include:\n\n* **Economic policy**: The party has traditionally been associated with free-market economics and has advocated for lower taxes, reduced government spending, and deregulation.\n* **Social policy**: The party has traditionally been associated with socially conservative policies, including opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage.\n* **Foreign policy**: The party has traditionally been associated with a strong national defence and has advocated for a more assertive foreign policy.\n* **Environmental policy**: The party has traditionally been associated with a more sceptical approach to climate change and has advocated for a more incremental approach to environmental policy.\n\n**Party structure**\n\nThe Conservative Party is a voluntary party, with members and supporters across the UK. The party is led by a leader, who is elected by the party's members. The leader is assisted by a team of senior politicians, known as the shadow cabinet, who are responsible for overseeing the party's policy development and media presence.\n\n**Membership**\n\nMembership of the Conservative Party has declined over the years, from a peak of over 3 million in the 1950s to around 160,000 in 2019. The party has implemented various measures to try to increase membership, including offering discounts to new members and providing more opportunities for members to get involved in party activities.\n\n**Funding**\n\nThe Conservative Party is one of the wealthiest parties in the UK, with a significant annual budget. The party's funding comes from a variety of sources, including donations from corporate and individual donors, as well as from the sale of party merchandise and other income streams.\n\n**International organisations**\n\nThe Conservative Party is a member of a number of international organisations, including the International Democrat Union and the European People's Party.\n\n**Logo**\n\nThe Conservative Party's logo is a torch, which is meant to represent leadership, striving to win, dedication, and a sense of community.\n\n**Factions**\n\nThe Conservative Party has a number of internal factions, including:\n\n* **One-nation Conservatives**: A faction that advocates for a more inclusive and socially liberal approach to politics.\n* **Free-market Conservatives**: A faction that advocates for a more free-market approach to economics.\n* **Traditionalist Conservatives**: A faction that advocates for a more traditional and socially conservative approach to politics.\n\n**Electoral performance**\n\nThe Conservative Party has had a number of successes and failures in recent elections, including:\n\n* **2019 general election**: The party won 43.6% of the vote and 365 seats, making it the largest party in the House of Commons.\n* **2015 general election**: The party won 36.9% of the vote and 331 seats.\n* **2010 general election**: The party won 36.1% of the vote and 306 seats.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Conservative_Party_(UK)\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nSome writers trace

won them the 1951 general election [75]\n\n\nModernising the party\nIn 1947, the party published its Industrial Charter which marked its acceptance of the \"post-war consensus\" on the mixed economy and labour rights [76] David Maxwell Fyfe chaired a committee into Conservative Party organisation that resulted in the Maxwell Fyfe Report (1948–49) The report required the party to do more fundraising, by forbidding constituency associations from demanding large donations from candidates, with the intention of broadening the diversity of MPs In practice, it may have had the effect of lending more power to constituency parties and making candidates more uniform [77] Winston Churchill, the party leader, brought in a Party chairman to modernise the party: Frederick Marquis, 1st Earl of Woolton rebuilt the local organisations with an emphasis on membership, money, and a unified national propaganda appeal on critical issues [78]\n\n\n1965–1975: Edward Heath\nEdward Heath's 1970–74 government was known for taking the UK into the EEC, although the right-wing of the party objected to his failure to control the trade unions at a time when a declining British industry saw many

boost in Conservative Party fortunes [97] The election was held on 9 April 1992 and the Conservatives won a fourth successive electoral victory, contrary to predictions from opinion polls [98] [99] The Conservatives became the first party to attract 14 million votes in a general election [100] [101]\n\n\n1997–2010: Political wilderness\nMajor resigned as party leader and was succeeded by William Hague [108] The 2001 general election resulted in a net gain of one seat for the Conservative Party and returned a mostly unscathed Labour Party back to government [109] This all occurred months after the fuel protests of September 2000 had seen the Conservatives briefly take a narrow lead over Labour in the opinion polls [110]\n\n\n2010–2024: Austerity, Brexit, and the pandemic\nIn May 2010 the Conservative Party came to government, first under a coalition with the Liberal Democrats and later as a series of majority and minority governments During this period there were five Conservative Prime Ministers: David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, and Rishi Sunak The initial period of this time, primarily under the premiership of David Cameron, was marked by the ongoing effects of the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the implementation of austerity measures in response From 2015 the predominant political event was the Brexit referendum and the process to implement the decision to leave the trade bloc.\n\n\n2010–2016: David Cameron\nThe 2010 election resulted in a hung parliament with the Conservatives having the most seats but short of an overall majority [133] Following the resignation of Gordon Brown, Cameron was named Prime Minister, and the Conservatives entered government in a coalition with the Liberal Democrats—the first postwar coalition government [134] [135]\n\n\n2016–2019: Theresa May\nOn 11 July 2016, Theresa May became the leader of the Conservative Party [144] May promised social reform and a more centrist political outlook for the Conservative Party and its government [145] May's early cabinet appointments were interpreted as an effort to reunite the party in the wake of the UK's vote to leave the European Union [146]\n\n\n2019–2022: Boris Johnson\nIn July 2019 Boris Johnson became Leader of the party [153] He became Prime Minister the next day Johnson had made withdrawal from the EU by 31 October \"with no ifs, buts or maybes\" a key pledge during his campaign for party leadership [154]\n\n\n2022: Liz Truss\nBoris Johnson's successor as leader was confirmed as Liz Truss on 5 September, following a leadership election [167] In a strategy labelled Trussonomics she introduced policies in response to the cost of living crisis, [168] including price caps on energy bills and government help to pay them [169] Truss's mini-budget on 23 September faced severe criticism and markets reacted poorly; [170] the pound fell to a record low of 1.03 against the dollar, and UK government gilt yields rose to 4.3 per cent, prompting the Bank of England to trigger an emergency bond-buying programme [171] [172] After condemnation from the public, the Labour Party and her own party, Truss reversed some aspects of the mini-budget, including the abolition of the top rate of income tax [173] [174] Following a government crisis Truss announced her resignation as prime minister on 20 October [175] after 44 days in office, the shortest premiership in British history [175] [176] Truss also oversaw the worst polling the Conservatives had ever received, with Labour polling as high as 36 per cent above the Conservatives amidst the crisis [177]\n\n\n2022–2024: Rishi Sunak\nOn 24 October 2022, Rishi Sunak was declared Leader, the first British Asian Leader of the Conservatives and the first British Asian Prime Minister On 22 May Sunak announced a general election to be held on 4 July 2024 [178]\n\n\n2024: Kemi Badenoch\nOn 2 November 2024 Kemi Badenoch was elected as the leader of the Conservatives after the party's significant election defeat, ending 14 years in power She secured 57% of nearly 100,000 votes against Robert Jenrick, succeeding Rishi Sunak In her victory speech, Badenoch acknowledged past mistakes and called for honesty and renewal With a background in business and software engineering, she promotes low taxes and free-market policies [185]\n\n\nPolicies\nDefunct\n\n\nEconomic policy\nDefunct\n\n\nSocial policy\nSocially conservative policies such as tax incentives for married couples may have played a role in the party's electoral decline in the 1990s and early 2000s, and so the party has attempted to seek a new direction As part of their coalition with the Liberal Democrats, the Conservative government did support the introduction of equal marriage rights for LGBT+ individuals in 2010, though 139 Conservative MPs, a majority, voted against the 2013 same-sex marriage act Thus the extent to which this policy represented a more liberal Conservative party has been challenged [198]\n\n\nForeign policy\nFor much of the 20th century, the Conservative Party took a broadly Atlanticist stance in relations with the United States, Members of EU and NATO, favouring close ties with the United States and similarly aligned nations such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Japan The Conservatives have generally favoured a diverse range of international alliances, ranging from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to the Commonwealth of Nations The Conservatives have proposed a Pan-African Free Trade Area, which it says could help entrepreneurial dynamism of African people [216] The Conservatives pledged to increase aid spending to 0.7% of national income by 2013 [216] They met this pledge in 2014, when spending on aid reached 0.72% of GDP and the commitment was enshrined in UK law in 2015 [217]\n\n\nDefence policy\nAfter the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the Conservative Party supported the coalition military action in Afghanistan The Conservative Party believed that success in Afghanistan would be defined in terms of the Afghans achieving the capability to maintain their own internal and external security They have repeatedly criticised the former Labour Government for failing to equip British Forces adequately in the earlier days on the campaign—especially highlighting the shortage of helicopters for British Forces resulting from Gordon Brown's £1.4bn cut to the helicopter budget in 2004 [233]\n\n\nHealth and drug policy\nIn 1945 the Conservatives declared support for universal healthcare [238] They introduced the Health and Social Care Act 2012, constituting the biggest reformation that the NHS has ever undertaken [239]\n\n\nEducation and research\nIn education, the Conservatives pledged to review the National Curriculum, introduce the English Baccalaureate, and reform GCSE, A-level, other national qualifications, apprenticeships and training [244] The restoration of discipline was also highlighted, as they want it to be easier for pupils to be searched for contraband items, the granting of anonymity to teachers accused by pupils, and the banning of expelled pupils being returned to schools via appeal panels.\n\n\nFamily policy\nAs prime minister, David Cameron wanted to 'support family life in Britain' and put families at the centre of domestic social policymaking [249] He stated in 2014 that there was 'no better place to start' in the Conservative mission of 'building society from the bottom up' than the family, which was responsible for individual welfare and well-being long before the welfare state came into play [249] He also argued that 'family and politics are inextricably linked' [249] Both Cameron and Theresa May aimed at helping families achieve a work-home balance and have previously proposed to offer all parents 12 months parental leave, to be shared by parents as they choose [250] This policy is now in place, offering 50 weeks total parental leave, of which 37 weeks are paid leave, which can be shared between both parents [251]\n\n\nJobs and welfare policy\nOne of the Conservatives' key policy goals in 2010 was to reduce the number of people unemployed, and increase the number of people in the workforce, by strengthening apprenticeships, skills and job training [254] Between 2010 and 2014, all claimants of Incapacity Benefit were moved onto a new benefit scheme, Employment and Support Allowance, which was then subsumed into the Universal Credit system alongside other welfare benefits in 2018 [255] [256] [257] The Universal Credit system came under immense scrutiny following its introduction Shortly after her appointment to the Department for Work and Pensions, the then Secretary of State Amber Rudd acknowledged there were real problems with the Universal Credit system, especially the wait times for initial payments and the housing payments aspect of the combined benefits [258] Rudd pledged specifically to review and address the uneven impact of Universal Credit implementation on economically disadvantaged women, which had been the subject of numerous reports by the Radio 4 You and Yours programme and others [258]\n\n\nEnergy and climate change policy\nDavid Cameron brought several 'green' issues to the forefront of his 2010 campaign These included proposals designed to impose a tax on workplace car parking spaces, a halt to airport growth, a tax on cars with exceptionally poor petrol mileage, and restrictions on car advertising Many of these policies were implemented in the Coalition—including the 'Green Deal' [263] A law was passed in 2019, that UK greenhouse gas emissions will be net zero by 2050 [264] The UK was the first major economy to embrace a legal obligation to achieve net zero carbon emissions [265]\n\n\nJustice, crime and security policy\nIn 2010 the Conservatives campaigned to cut the perceived bureaucracy of the modern police force and pledged greater legal protection to people convicted of defending themselves against intruders.\n\n\nTransport and infrastructure policy\nThe Conservatives have invested in public transport and infrastructure, aimed to promoting economic growth [270] This has included rail (including high-speed rail), electric vehicles, bus networks, and active transport [271]\n\n\nEuropean Union policy\nNo subject has proved more divisive in the Conservative Party in recent history than the role of the United Kingdom within the European Union Though the principal architect of the UK's entry into the European Communities (which became the European Union) was Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath, most contemporary Conservative opinion is opposed to closer economic and particularly political union with the EU This is a noticeable shift in British politics, as in the 1960s and 1970s the Conservatives were more pro-Europe than the Labour Party: for example, in the 1971 House of Commons vote on whether the UK should join the European Economic Community, only 39 of the then 330 Conservative MPs were opposed [278] [279]\n\n\nConstitutional policy\nTraditionally the Conservative Party has supported the uncodified constitution of the United Kingdom and its traditional Westminster system of politics The party opposed many of Tony Blair's reforms, such as the removal of the hereditary peers, [280] the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into British law, and the 2009 creation of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, a function formerly carried out by the House of Lords.\n\n\nOrganisation\nThe Conservative Party comprises the voluntary party, parliamentary party (sometimes called the political party) and the professional party.\n\n\nParty structure\nThe Conservative Party comprises the voluntary party, parliamentary party (sometimes called the political party) and the professional party.\n\n\nMembership\nMembership peaked in the mid-1950s at approximately 3 million, before declining steadily through the second half of the 20th century [287] Despite an initial boost shortly after David Cameron's election as leader in December 2005, membership resumed its decline in 2006 to a lower level than when he was elected In 2010 the Conservative Party had about 177,000 members according to activist Tim Montgomerie, [288] and in 2013 membership was estimated by the party itself at 134,000 [289] The Conservative Party had a membership of 124,000 in March 2018 [290] In May 2019 its membership was thought to be around 160,000, with over half of its members being over 55 [291] [292] Its membership rose to 200,000 in March 2021 [293] In July 2022 it had 172,437 members [294]\n\n\nProspective parliamentary candidates\nAssociations select their constituency's candidates [283] [295] Some associations have organised open parliamentary primaries A constituency Association must choose a candidate using the rules approved by, and (in England, Wales and Northern Ireland) from a list established by, the Committee on Candidates of the Board of the Conservative Party [296] Prospective candidates apply to the Conservative Central Office to be included on the approved list of candidates, some candidates will be given the option of applying for any seat they choose, while others may be restricted to certain constituencies [297] [298] A Conservative MP can only be deselected at a special general meeting of the local Conservative association, which can only be organised if backed by a petition of more than fifty members [297]\n\n\nYoung Conservatives\nYoung Conservatives is the youth wing of the Conservative Party for members aged 25 and under The organisation aims to increase youth ownership and engagement in local associations [299] From 1998 to 2015, the youth wing was called Conservative Future, and had branches at universities and at parliamentary constituency level It was shut down in 2015 after allegations that bullying by Mark Clarke had caused the suicide of Elliot Johnson, a 21-year-old party activist [300] [301] [302] The current incarnation was launched in March 2018.\n\n\nConferences\nThe major annual party events are the Spring Forum and the Conservative Party Conference, which takes place in Autumn in alternately Manchester or Birmingham This is when the National Conservative Convention holds meetings.\n\n\nFunding\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, half the party's funding came from a cluster of fifty \"donor groups\", and a third of it from only fifteen [303] In the year after the 2010 general election, half the Conservatives' funding came from the financial sector [304]\n\n\nFinancial ties to Russian oligarchs\nThe Conservative Party has received funding from Russian oligarchs, beginning in the early 2000s, for which it has been criticised [310] [311] Scrutiny became more prominent after alleged interference in the 2016 Brexit referendum by the Kremlin to support the Vote Leave campaign, and increased after the Intelligence and Security Committee Russia report into Russian interference in British politics was published in July 2020 Concerns over Conservative Party funds have become increasingly controversial due to Vladimir Putin's human rights abuses and the Russian invasion of Ukraine [312]\n\n\nInternational organisations\nThe Conservative Party is a member of a number of international organisations, most notably the International Democracy Union which unites right-wing parties including the United States Republican Party, the Liberal Party of Australia, the Conservative Party of Canada and the South Korean People Power Party.\n\n\nLogo\nWhen Sir Christopher Lawson was appointed as a marketing director at Conservative Central Office in 1981, he developed a logo design based on the Olympic flame in the colours of the Union Jack, [320] which was intended to represent leadership, striving to win, dedication, and a sense of community [321] The emblem was adopted for the 1983 general election [320] In 1989, the party's director of communications, Brendan Bruce, found through market research that recognition of the symbol was low and that people found it old fashioned and uninspiring Using a design company headed by Michael Peters, an image of a hand carrying a torch was developed, which referenced the Statue of Liberty [322]\n\n\nParty factions\nThe Conservative Party has a variety of internal factions or ideologies, including one-nation conservatism, [327] [328] Christian democracy, [329] social conservatism, Thatcherism, traditional conservatism, neoconservatism, [330] [331] Euroscepticism, [332] and, since 2016, right-wing populism [23] [333]\n\n\nOne-nation Conservatives\nOne-nation conservatism was the party's dominant ideology in the 20th century until the rise of Thatcherism in the 1970s It has included in its ranks Conservative Prime Ministers such as Stanley Baldwin, Harold Macmillan and Edward Heath [334] One-nation Conservatives in the contemporary party include former First Secretary of State Damian Green, the current chair of the One Nation Conservatives caucus.\n\n\nFree-market Conservatives\nThe \"free-market wing\" of economic liberals achieved dominance after the election of Margaret Thatcher as party leader in 1975 Their goal was to reduce the role of the government in the economy and to this end, they supported cuts in direct taxation, the privatisation of nationalised industries and a reduction in the size and scope of the welfare state Supporters of the \"free-market wing\" have been labelled as \"Thatcherites\" The group has disparate views of social policy: Thatcher herself was socially conservative and a practising Anglican but the free-market wing in the Conservative Party harbour a range of social opinions from the civil libertarian views of Michael Portillo, Daniel Hannan, and David Davis to the traditional conservatism of former party leaders William Hague and Iain Duncan Smith The Thatcherite wing is also associated with the concept of a \"classless society\" [336]\n\n\nTraditionalist Conservatives\nThis socially conservative right-wing grouping is currently associated with the Cornerstone Group (or Faith, Flag and Family), and is the oldest tradition within the Conservative Party, closely associated with High Toryism The name stems from its support for three social institutions: the Church of England, the unitary British state and the family To this end, it emphasises the country's Anglican heritage, oppose any transfer of power away from the United Kingdom—either downwards to the nations and regions or upwards to the European Union—and seek to place greater emphasis on traditional family structures to repair what it sees as a broken society in the UK It is a strong advocate of marriage and believes the Conservative Party

state located in the northern part of India. It is known for its natural beauty, rich cultural heritage, and diverse geography. The state is divided into two main regions: Garhwal and Kumaon, each with its unique culture, language, and traditions. This article provides an overview of Uttarakhand's history, geography, climate, flora and fauna, demographics, social groups, languages, religion, administrative divisions, government, culture, economy, transportation, tourism, education, sports, and notable people.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"Uttarakhand\" is derived from the Sanskrit words \"uttara\" (उत्तर) meaning \"north\", and \"khaṇḍa\" (खण्ड) meaning \"section\" or \"part\", altogether simply meaning \"Northern Part\". The name finds mention in early Hindu scriptures as the combined region of \"Kedarkhand\" (present day Garhwal) and \"Manaskhand\" (present day Kumaon). Uttarakhand was also the ancient Puranic term for the central stretch of the Indian Himalayas.\n\n**History**\n\nArchaeological evidence supports the existence of humans in the region since prehistoric times. Though initially, it was believed that due to harsh climate and mountainous terrain, this was a barren and uninhabited land. After various excavations and the study of ancient literature, it is now established that the history of Uttarakhand goes back to Stone Age. Evidences of Stone Age settlements have been found in various parts of Kumaon and Garhwal, particularly notable are the rock shelters at Lakhudyar, Almora.\n\n**Geography**\n\nUttarakhand has a total area of 53,483 km², of which 86% is mountainous and 65% is covered by forest.

of the UNESCO [97] [98] [99] [100] [101]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe Uttarakhand state is the second fastest growing state in India [105] Its gross state domestic product (GSDP) (at constant prices) more than doubled from ₹24,786 crore in FY2005 to ₹60,898 crore in FY2012 The real GSDP grew at 13.7% (CAGR) during the FY2005–FY2012 period The contribution of the service sector to the GSDP of Uttarakhand was just over 50% during FY 2012 Per capita income in Uttarakhand is ₹ 198738 (FY 2018–19), which is higher than the national average of ₹ 126406 (FY 2018–19) [106] [107] According to the Reserve Bank of India, the total foreign direct investment in the state from April 2000 to October 2009 amounted to US$46.7 million [108]\n\n\nTransportation\nUttarakhand has 2,683 km (1,667 mi) of roads, of which

routes in Uttarakhand and the neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh [114] For travelling locally, the state, like most of the country, has auto rickshaws and cycle rickshaws In addition, remote towns and villages in the hills are connected to important road junctions and bus routes by share mode of transportation [citation needed]\n\n\nTourism\nUttarakhand has many tourist spots due to its location in the Himalayas There are many ancient temples, forest reserves, national parks, hill stations, and mountain peaks that draw large number of tourists There are 44 nationally protected

{"title": "Eurovision_Song_Contest", "content": "\nOrigins and history\nThe Eurovision Song Contest was developed by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as an experiment in live television broadcasting and a way to produce cheaper programming for national broadcasting organisations [1] [2] The word \"Eurovision\" was first used by British journalist George Campey in the London Evening Standard in 1951, when he referred to a BBC programme being relayed by Dutch television [3] [4] Following several events broadcast internationally via the Eurovision transmission network in the early 1950s, including the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953, an EBU committee, headed by Marcel Bezençon, was formed in January 1955 to investigate new initiatives for cooperation between broadcasters, which approved for further study a European song competition from an idea initially proposed by RAI manager Sergio Pugliese [4] [5] [6] The EBU's general assembly agreed to the organising of the song contest in October 1955, under the initial title of the European Grand Prix, and accepted a proposal by the Swiss delegation to host the event in Lugano in the spring of 1956 [3] [4] [7] The Italian Sanremo Music Festival, held since 1951, was used as a basis for the initial planning of the contest, with several amendments and additions given its international nature [3]\n\n\nNaming\nOver the years the name used to describe the contest, and used on the official logo for each edition, has evolved The first contests were produced under the name of Grand Prix Eurovision de la Chanson Européenne in French and as the Eurovision Song Contest Grand Prix in English, with similar variations used in the languages of each of the broadcasting countries From 1968, the English name dropped the 'Grand Prix' from the name, with the French name being aligned as the Concours Eurovision de la Chanson, first used in 1973 [19] [34] [35] The contest's official brand guidance specifies that translations of the name may be used depending on national tradition and brand recognition in the competing countries, but that the official name Eurovision Song Contest is always preferred; the contest is commonly referred to in English by the abbreviation \"Eurovision\", and in internal documents by the acronym \"ESC\" [36]\n\n\nFormat\nOriginal songs representing participating countries are performed in a live television programme broadcast via the Eurovision and Euroradio networks simultaneously to all countries A \"country\" as a participant is represented by one television broadcaster from that country, a member of the European Broadcasting Union, and is typically that country's national public broadcasting organisation [37] The programme is staged by one of the participant countries and is broadcast from an auditorium in the selected host city [38] Since 2008, each contest is typically formed of three live television shows held over one week: two semi-finals are held on the Tuesday and Thursday, followed by a final on the Saturday All participating countries compete in one of the two semi-finals, except for the host country of that year's contest and the contest's biggest financial contributors known as the \"Big Five\"—France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom [37] [39] The remaining countries are split between the two semi-finals, and the 10 highest-scoring entries in each qualify to produce 26 countries competing in the final [37] Since the introduction of the semi-final round in 2004, Luxembourg and Ukraine are the only countries outside of the \"Big Five\" to have qualified for the final of every contest they have competed in.\n\n\nParticipation\nActive members (as opposed to associate members) of the European Broadcasting Union are eligible to participate; active members are those who are located in states that fall within the European Broadcasting Area, or are member states of the Council of Europe [50] Active members include media organisations whose broadcasts are often made available to at least 98% of households in their own country which are equipped to receive such transmissions [51] Associate member broadcasters may be eligible to compete, dependent on approval by the contest's Reference Group [52]\n\n\nHosting\nThe winning country traditionally hosts the following year's event, with some exceptions since 1958 [56] [19] Hosting the contest can be seen as a unique opportunity for promoting the host country as a tourist destination and can provide benefits to the local economy and tourism sectors of the host city [57] However, there is a perception reflected in popular culture that some countries wish to avoid the costly burden of hosting – sometimes resulting in them sending deliberately subpar entries with no chance of winning This belief is mentioned in Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga (2020) and a plot point in the Father Ted episode \"A Song for Europe\" (1996) [58]  Preparations for each year's contest typically begin at the conclusion of the previous year's contest, with the winning country's head of delegation receiving a welcome package of information related to hosting the contest at the winner's press conference [37] [59] [60] Eurovision is a non-profit event, and financing is typically achieved through a fee from each participating broadcaster, contributions from the host broadcaster and the host city, and commercial revenues from sponsorships, ticket sales, televoting and merchandise [55]\n\n\nEurovision logo and theme\nUntil 2004, each edition of the contest used its own logo and visual identity as determined by the respective host broadcaster To create a consistent visual identity, a generic logo was introduced ahead of the 2004 contest This is typically accompanied by a unique theme artwork designed for each individual contest by the host broadcaster, with the flag of the host country placed prominently in the centre of the Eurovision heart [36] The original logo was designed by the London-based agency JM International, and received a revamp in 2014 by the Amsterdam-based Cityzen Agency for the contest's 60th edition [67] [68]\n\n\nPreparations\nPreparations in the host venue typically begin approximately six weeks before the final, to accommodate building works and technical rehearsals before the arrival of the competing artists [76] Delegations will typically arrive in the host city two to three weeks before the live show, and each participating broadcaster nominates a head of delegation, responsible for coordinating the movements of their delegation and being that country's representative to the EBU [46] [77] Members of each country's delegation include performers, composers, lyricists, members of the press, and—in the years where a live orchestra was present—a conductor [78] Present if desired is a commentator, who provides commentary of the event for their country's radio and/or television feed in their country's own language in dedicated booths situated around the back of the arena behind the audience [79] [80]\n\n\nRules\nThe contest is organised annually by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), together with the participating broadcaster of the host country The event is monitored by an Executive Supervisor appointed by the EBU, and by the Reference Group which represents all participating broadcasters, who are each represented by a nominated Head of Delegation [92] The current Executive Supervisor is Martin Österdahl, who took over the role from Jon Ola Sand in May 2020 [93] A detailed set of rules is written by the EBU for each contest and approved by the Reference Group These rules have changed over time, and typically outline, among other points, the eligibility of the competing songs, the format of the contest, and the voting system to be used to determine the winner and how the results will be presented [46]\n\n\nSong eligibility and languages\nAll competing songs must have a duration of three minutes or less [46] This rule applies only to the version performed during the live shows [94] In order to be considered eligible, competing songs in a given year's contest must not have been released commercially before the first day of September of the previous year [46] All competing entries must include vocals and lyrics of some kind, a cappella songs and purely instrumental pieces are not allowed [95] Competing entries may be performed in any language, be that natural or constructed, and participating broadcasters are free to decide the language in which their entry may be performed [46]\n\n\nArtist eligibility and performances\nThe rules for the first contest specified that only solo performers were permitted to enter; [104] this criterion was changed the following year to permit duos to compete, and groups were subsequently permitted for the first time in 1971 [105] [106] Currently the number of people permitted on stage during competing performances is limited to a maximum of six, and no live animals are allowed [46] Since 1990, all contestants must be aged 16 or over on the day of the live show in which they perform [107] Sandra Kim, the winner in 1986 at the age of 13, shall remain the contest's youngest winner while this rule remains in place [108] [109] There is no limit on the nationality or country of birth of the competing artists, and participating broadcasters are free to select an artist from any country; several winning artists have subsequently held a different nationality or were born in a different country to that which they represented [110] [10] No performer may compete for more than one country in a given year [46] There is no restriction regarding performers who have participated in past events competing again – whether for the same country or a different one It is even possible for a winning performer to try and defend their title in the next edition, as happened when 2010 winner Lena competed again in 2011 [111] However, in the history of the contest only two individuals have won more than once as a performer – Johnny Logan in 1980 and 1987 for Ireland, and Loreen in 2012 and 2023 for Sweden [112]\n\n\nRunning order\nSince 2013, the order in which the competing countries perform has been determined by the contest's producers, and submitted to the EBU Executive Supervisor and Reference Group for approval before public announcement This was changed from a random draw used in previous years in order to provide a better experience for television viewers and ensure all countries stand out by avoiding instances where songs of a similar style or tempo are performed in sequence [118]\n\n\nVoting\nSince 2023, the voting system used to determine the results of the contest has worked on the basis of positional voting [126] [127] Each country awards 1–8, 10 and 12 points to the ten favourite songs as voted for by that country's general public or assembled jury, with the most preferred song receiving 12 points In the semi-finals, each country awards one set of points, based primarily on the votes cast by that country's viewing public via telephone, SMS or the official Eurovision app, while in the final, each country awards two sets of points, with one set awarded by the viewers and another awarded by a jury panel comprising five music professionals from that country [47] [126] Since 2023, viewers in non-participating countries have also been able to vote during the contest, with those viewers able to cast votes via an online platform, which are then aggregated and awarded as one set of points from an \"extra country\" for the overall public vote [128] [129] This system is a modification of that used since 1975, when the \"12 points\" system was first introduced but with one set of points per country, and a similar system used since 2016 where two sets of points were awarded in both the semi-finals and final [130] [131] National juries and the public in each country are not allowed to vote for their own country, a rule first introduced in 1957 [47] [105]\n\n\nPresentation of the votes\nSince 1957, each country's votes have been announced during a special voting segment as part of the contest's broadcast, with a selected spokesperson assigned to announce the results of their country's vote [47] This spokesperson is typically well known in their country; previous spokespersons have included former Eurovision artists and presenters [136] Historically, the announcements were made through telephone lines from the countries of origin, with satellite links employed for the first time in 1994, allowing the spokespersons to be seen visually by the audience and TV spectators [137]\n\n\nBroadcasting\nParticipating broadcasters are required to air live the semi-final in which they compete, or in the case of the automatic finalists the semi-final in which they are required to vote, and the final, in its entirety; this includes all competing songs, the voting recap containing short clips of the performances, the voting procedure or semi-final qualification reveal, and the reprise of the winning song in the final [46] [115] [140] Since 1999, broadcasters who wished to do so were given the opportunity to provide advertising during short, non-essential hiatuses in the show's schedule [114] In exceptional circumstances, such as due to developing emergency situations, participating broadcasters may delay or postpone broadcast of the event [141] [142] Should a broadcaster fail to air a show as expected in any other scenario they may be subject to sanctions by the EBU [143] [144] Several broadcasters in countries that are unable to compete have previously aired the contest in their markets [145] [146] [147]\n\n\nExpansion of the contest\nFrom the original seven countries which entered the first contest in 1956, the number of competing countries has steadily grown over time 18 countries participated in the contest's tenth edition in 1965, and by 1990, 22 countries were regularly competing each year [97] [156]\n\n\nPre-selections and relegation\n29 countries registered to take part in the 1993 contest, a figure the EBU considered unable to fit reasonably into a single TV show A pre-selection method was subsequently introduced for the first time in order to reduce the number of competing entries, with seven countries in Central and Eastern Europe participating in Kvalifikacija za Millstreet, held in Ljubljana, Slovenia one month before the event Following a vote amongst the seven competing countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia were chosen to head to the contest in Millstreet, Ireland, whilst Estonia, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia were forced to wait another year before being allowed to compete [63] [158] A new relegation system was introduced for entry into the 1994 contest, with the lowest-placed countries being forced to sit out the following year's event to be replaced by countries which had not competed in the previous contest The bottom seven countries in 1993 were required to miss the following year's contest, and were replaced by the four unsuccessful countries in Kvalifikacija za Millstreet and new entries from Lithuania, Poland and Russia [63] [137] [159]\n\n\nThe \"Big Five\"\nIn 1999, an exemption from relegation was introduced for France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, giving them an automatic right to compete in the 2000 contest and in all subsequent editions This group, as the highest-paying EBU members which significantly fund the contest each year, subsequently became known as the \"Big Four\" countries [102] [103] [114] This group was expanded in 2011 when Italy began competing again, becoming the \"Big Five\" [164] Originally brought in to ensure that the financial contributions of the contest's biggest financial backers would not be missed, since the introduction of the semi-finals in 2004, the \"Big Five\" now instead automatically qualify for the final along with the host country [165] [166]\n\n\nIntroduction of semi-finals\nAn influx of new countries applying for the 2003 contest resulted in the introduction of a semi-final from 2004, with the contest becoming a two-day event [171] [172] The top 10 countries in each year's final would qualify automatically to the following year's final, alongside the \"Big Four\", meaning all other countries would compete in the semi-final to compete for 10 qualification spots [165] The 2004 contest in Istanbul, Turkey saw a record 36 countries competing, with new entries from Albania, Andorra, Belarus and Serbia and Montenegro and the return of previously relegated countries [165] [173] The format of this semi-final remained similar to the final proper, taking place a few days before the final; following the performances and the voting window, the names of the 10 countries with the highest number of points, which would therefore qualify for the final, were announced at the end of the show, revealed in a random order by the contest's presenters [165] [173]\n\n\nEntries and participants\n The contest has been used as a launching point for artists who went on to achieve worldwide fame, and several of the world's best-selling artists are counted among past Eurovision Song Contest participants and winning artists ABBA, the 1974 winners for Sweden, have sold an estimated 380 million albums and singles since their contest win brought them to worldwide attention, with their winning song \"Waterloo\" selling over five million records [179] [180] Celine Dion's win for Switzerland in 1988 helped launch her international career, particularly in the anglophone market, and she would go on to sell an estimated 200 million records worldwide [138] [181] Julio Iglesias was relatively unknown when he represented Spain in 1970 and placed fourth, but worldwide success followed his Eurovision appearance, with an estimated 100 million records sold during his career [182] [183] Australian-British singer Olivia Newton-John represented the United Kingdom in 1974, placing fourth behind ABBA, but went on to sell an estimated 100 million records, win four Grammy Awards, and star in the critically and commercially successful musical film Grease [184] [185]\n\n\nWinners\n71 songs from 27 countries have won the Eurovision Song Contest as of 2024 [update] [10] Ireland and Sweden have recorded the most wins with seven each, followed by France, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands with five each [9] [10] Of the 52 countries to have taken part, 24 [a] have yet to win [19] Only one contest has featured multiple winners in a single year: in 1969, four countries [b] finished the contest with an equal number of points and were all declared winners due to the lack of tiebreak rules at the time [9] [253] A majority of winning songs have been performed in English, particularly since the rule requiring native-language songs was abolished in 1999: since then, only seven winning songs have been performed either fully or partially in a language other than English [19]\n\n\nInterval acts and guest appearances\nAlongside the song contest and appearances from local and international personalities, performances from non-competing artists and musicians have been included since the first edition, [43] [263] and have become a staple of the live show [262] These performances have varied widely, previously featuring music, art, dance and circus performances, and past participants are regularly invited to perform, with the reigning champion traditionally returning each year to perform the previous year's winning song [43] [264]\n\n\nCriticism and controversy\nThe contest has been the subject of considerable criticism regarding both its musical content and what has been reported to be a political element to the event, and several controversial moments have been witnessed over the course of its history [289]\n\n\nMusical style and presentation\nCriticism has been levied against the musical quality of past competing entries, with a perception that certain music styles seen as being presented more often than others in an attempt to appeal to as many potential voters as possible among the international audience [290] Power ballads, folk rhythms and bubblegum pop have been considered staples of the contest in recent years, leading to allegations that the event has become formulaic [291] [292] Other traits in past competing entries which have regularly been mocked by media and viewers include an abundance of key changes and lyrics about love and/or peace, as well as the pronunciation of English by non-native users of the language [290] [293] [294] Given Eurovision is principally a television show, over the years competing performances have attempted to attract the viewers' attention through means other than music, and elaborate lighting displays, pyrotechnics, and extravagant on-stage theatrics and costumes having become a common sight at recent contests; [295] criticism of these tactics have been levied as being a method of distracting the viewer from the weak musical quality of some of the competing entries [296]\n\n\nPolitical controversies\nAs artists and songs ultimately represent a country, the contest has seen several controversial moments where political tensions between competing countries as a result of frozen conflicts, and in some cases open warfare, are reflected in the performances and voting [303]\n\n\nPolitical and geographical voting\nThe contest has been described as containing political elements in its voting process, a perception that countries will give votes more frequently and in higher quantities to other countries based on political relationships, rather than the musical merits of the songs themselves [338] [339] Numerous studies and academic papers have been written on this subject, which have corroborated that certain countries form \"clusters\" or \"cliques\" by frequently voting in the same way; one study concludes that voting blocs can play a crucial role in deciding the winner of the contest, with evidence that on at least two occasions bloc voting was a pivotal factor in the vote for the winning song [340] [341] Other views on these \"blocs\" argue that certain countries will allocate high points to others based on similar musical tastes, shared cultural links and a high degree of similarity and mutual intelligibility between languages, and are therefore more likely to appreciate and vote for the competing songs from these countries based on these factors, rather than political relationships specifically [342] [343] Analysis on other voting patterns have revealed examples which indicate voting preferences among countries based on shared religion, as well as \"patriotic voting\", particularly since the introduction of televoting in 1997, where foreign nationals vote for their country of origin [343] [344]\n\n\nLGBT visibility\nEurovision has had a long-held fan base in the LGBT community, and contest organisers have actively worked to include these fans in the event since the 1990s [355] Paul Oscar became the contest's first openly gay artist to compete when he represented Iceland in 1997 Israel's Dana International, the contest's first trans performer, became the first LGBT artist to win in 1998 [356] [132] In 2021, Nikkie de Jager became the first trans person to host the contest [357]\n\n\nCultural influence\nThe Eurovision Song Contest has amassed a global following and sees annual audience figures of between 100 and 600 million [380] [381] The contest has become a cultural influence worldwide since its first years It is regularly described as having kitsch appeal, and is included as a topic of parody in television sketches and in stage performances at the Edinburgh Fringe and Melbourne Comedy festivals amongst others [292] [296] [382] [383] Several films have been created which celebrate the contest, including Eytan Fox's 2013 Israeli comedy Cupcakes, and the Netflix 2020 musical comedy, Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga, produced with backing from the EBU and starring Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams [384] [385] [386]\n\n\nSpecial events and related competitions\nSeveral anniversary events, and related contests under the \"Eurovision Live Events\" brand, have been organised by the EBU with its member broadcasters [396] In addition, participating broadcasters have occasionally commissioned special Eurovision programmes for their home audiences, and a number of other imitator contests have been developed outside of the EBU framework, on both a national and international level [397] [398]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Introduction**\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest is an annual international song competition that has been held since 1956. It is one of the longest-running and most popular television events in the world, with a global audience of over 100 million viewers. The contest is organized by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and features a competition between participating countries, each represented by a singer or band that performs an original song. The contest is known for its unique blend of music, culture, and politics, and has become a beloved tradition in many countries around the world.\n\n**Origins and History**\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest was developed by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as an experiment in live television broadcasting and a way to produce cheaper programming for national broadcasting organizations. The word \"Eurovision\" was first used by British journalist George Campey in the London Evening Standard in 1951, when he referred to a BBC program being relayed by Dutch television.\n\nFollowing several events broadcast internationally via the Eurovision transmission network in the early 1950s, including the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953, an EBU committee, headed by Marcel Bezençon, was formed in January 1955 to investigate new initiatives for cooperation between broadcasters. The committee approved for further study a European song competition from an idea initially proposed by RAI manager Sergio Pugliese.\n\nThe EBU's general assembly agreed to the organizing of the song contest in October 1955, under the initial title of the European Grand Prix, and accepted a proposal by the Swiss delegation to host the event in Lugano in the spring of 1956. The Italian Sanremo Music Festival, held since 1951, was used as a basis for the initial planning of the contest, with several amendments and additions given its international nature.\n\n**Naming**\n\nOver the years, the name used to describe the contest, and used on the official logo for each edition, has evolved. The first contests were produced under the name of Grand Prix Eurovision de la Chanson Européenne in French and as the Eurovision Song Contest Grand Prix in English, with similar variations used in the languages of each of the broadcasting countries. From 1968, the English name dropped the 'Grand Prix' from the name, with the French name being aligned as the Concours Eurovision de la Chanson, first used in 1973.\n\nThe contest's official brand guidance specifies that translations of the name may be used depending on national tradition and brand recognition in the competing countries, but that the official name Eurovision Song Contest is always preferred. The contest is commonly referred to in English by the abbreviation \"Eurovision\", and in internal documents by the acronym \"ESC\".\n\n**Format**\n\nOriginal songs representing participating countries are performed in a live television program broadcast via the Eurovision and Euroradio networks simultaneously to all countries. A \"country\" as a participant is represented by one television broadcaster from that country, a member of the European Broadcasting Union, and is typically that country's national public broadcasting organization.\n\nThe program is staged by one of the participant countries and is broadcast from an auditorium in the selected host city. Since 2008, each contest is typically formed of three live television shows held over one week: two semi-finals are held on the Tuesday and Thursday, followed by a final on the Saturday.\n\nAll participating countries compete in one of the two semi-finals, except for the host country of that year's contest and the contest's biggest financial contributors known as the \"Big Five\" - France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The remaining countries are split between the two semi-finals, and the 10 highest-scoring entries in each qualify to produce 26 countries competing in the final.\n\n**Participation**\n\nActive members (as opposed to associate members) of the European Broadcasting Union are eligible to participate. Active members are those who are located in states that fall within the European Broadcasting Area, or are member states of the Council of Europe. Active members include media organizations whose broadcasts are often made available to at least 98% of households in their own country which are equipped to receive such transmissions.\n\nAssociate member broadcasters may be eligible to compete, dependent on approval by the contest's Reference Group. Associate members are countries who are not members of the Council of Europe, but are members of the EBU.\n\n**Hosting**\n\nThe winning country traditionally hosts the following year's event, with some exceptions since 1958. Hosting the contest can be seen as a unique opportunity for promoting the host country as a tourist destination and can provide benefits to the local economy and tourism sectors of the host city.\n\nHowever, there is a perception reflected in popular culture that some countries wish to avoid the costly burden of hosting - sometimes resulting in them sending deliberately subpar entries with no chance of winning. This belief is mentioned in Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga (2020) and a plot point in the Father Ted episode \"A Song for Europe\" (1996).\n\nPreparations for each year's contest typically begin at the conclusion of the previous year's contest, with the winning country's head of delegation receiving a welcome package of information related to hosting the contest at the winner's press conference.\n\n**Eurovision Logo and Theme**\n\nUntil 2004, each edition of the contest used its own logo and visual identity as determined by the respective host broadcaster. To create a consistent visual identity, a generic logo was introduced ahead of the 2004 contest.\n\nThis is typically accompanied by a unique theme artwork designed for each individual contest by the host broadcaster, with the flag of the host country placed prominently in the centre of the Eurovision heart. The original logo was designed by the London-based agency JM International, and received a revamp in 2014 by the Amsterdam-based Cityzen Agency for the contest's 60th edition.\n\n**Preparations**\n\nPreparations in the host venue typically begin approximately six weeks before the final, to accommodate building works and technical rehearsals before the arrival of the competing artists.\n\nDelegations will typically arrive in the host city two to three weeks before the live show, and each participating broadcaster nominates a head of delegation, responsible for coordinating the movements of their delegation and being that country's representative to the EBU.\n\nMembers of each country's delegation include performers, composers, lyricists, members of the press, and - in the years where a live orchestra was present - a conductor. Present if desired is a commentator, who provides commentary of the event for their country's radio and/or television feed in their country's own language in dedicated booths situated around the back of the arena behind the audience.\n\n**Rules**\n\nThe contest is organized annually by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), together with the participating broadcaster of the host country.\n\nThe event is monitored by an Executive Supervisor appointed by the EBU, and by the Reference Group which represents all participating broadcasters, who are each represented by a nominated Head of Delegation.\n\nA detailed set of rules is written by the EBU for each contest and approved by the Reference Group. These rules have changed over time, and typically outline, among other points, the eligibility of the competing songs, the format of the contest, and the voting system to be used to determine the winner and how the results will be presented.\n\n**Song Eligibility and Languages**\n\nAll competing songs must have a duration of three minutes or less. This rule applies only to the version performed during the live shows.\n\nIn order to be considered eligible, competing songs in a given year's contest must not have been released commercially before the first day of September of the previous year.\n\nAll competing entries must include vocals and lyrics of some kind, a cappella songs and purely instrumental pieces are not allowed.\n\nCompeting entries may be performed in any language, be that natural or constructed, and participating broadcasters are free to decide the language in which their entry may be performed.\n\n**Artist Eligibility and Performances**\n\nThe rules for the first contest specified that only solo performers were permitted to enter. This criterion was changed the following year to permit duos to compete, and groups were subsequently permitted for the first time in 1971.\n\nCurrently the number of people permitted on stage during competing performances is limited to a maximum of six, and no live animals are allowed.\n\nSince 1990, all contestants must be aged 16 or over on the day of the live show in which they perform.\n\nSandra Kim, the winner in 1986 at the age of 13, shall remain the contest's youngest winner while this rule remains in place.\n\nThere is no limit on the nationality or country of birth of the competing artists, and participating broadcasters are free to select an artist from any country. Several winning artists have subsequently held a different nationality or were born in a different country to that which they represented.\n\nNo performer may compete for more than one country in a given year.\n\nThere is no restriction regarding performers who have participated in past events competing again - whether for the same country or a different one.\n\n**Running Order**\n\nSince 2013, the order in which the competing countries perform has been determined by the contest's producers, and submitted to the EBU Executive Supervisor and Reference Group for approval before public announcement.\n\nThis was changed from a random draw used in previous years in order to provide a better experience for television viewers and ensure all countries stand out by avoiding instances where songs of a similar style or tempo are performed in sequence.\n\n**Voting**\n\nSince 2023, the voting system used to determine the results of the contest has worked on the basis of positional voting.\n\nEach country awards 1-8, 10 and 12 points to the ten favourite songs as voted for by that country's general public or assembled jury, with the most preferred song receiving 12 points.\n\nIn the semi-finals, each country awards one set of points, based primarily on the votes cast by that country's viewing public via telephone, SMS or the official Eurovision app.\n\nIn the final, each country awards two sets of points, with one set awarded by the viewers and another awarded by a jury panel comprising five music professionals from that country.\n\nViewers in non-participating countries have also been able to vote during the contest, with those viewers able to cast votes via an online platform, which are then aggregated and awarded as one set of points from an \"extra country\" for the overall public vote.\n\nThis system is a modification of that used since 1975, when the \"12 points\" system was first introduced but with one set of points per country, and a similar system used since 2016 where two sets of points were awarded in both the semi-finals and final.\n\n**Presentation of the Votes**\n\nSince 1957, each country's votes have been announced during a special voting segment as part of the contest's broadcast, with a selected spokesperson assigned to announce the results of their country's vote.\n\nThis spokesperson is typically well known in their country. Previous spokespersons have included former Eurovision artists and presenters.\n\nHistorically, the announcements were made through telephone lines from the countries of origin, with satellite links employed for the first time in 1994, allowing the spokespersons to be seen visually by the audience and TV spectators.\n\n**Broadcasting**\n\nParticipating broadcasters are required to air live the semi-final in which they compete, or in the case of the automatic finalists the semi-final in which they are required to vote, and the final, in its entirety.\n\nThis includes all competing songs, the voting recap containing short clips of the performances, the voting procedure or semi-final qualification reveal, and the reprise of the winning song in the final.\n\nSince 1999, broadcasters who wished to do so were given the opportunity to provide advertising during short, non-essential hiatuses in the show's schedule.\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, such as due to developing emergency situations, participating broadcasters may delay or postpone broadcast of the event.\n\nShould a broadcaster fail to air a show as expected in any other scenario they may be subject to sanctions by the EBU.\n\n**Expansion of the Contest**\n\nFrom the original seven countries which entered the first contest in 1956, the number of competing countries has steadily grown over time.\n\n18 countries participated in the contest's tenth edition in 1965, and by 1990, 22 countries were regularly competing each year.\n\n**Pre-selections and Relegation**\n\n29 countries registered to take part in the 1993 contest, a figure the EBU considered unable to fit reasonably into a single TV show.\n\nA pre-selection method was subsequently introduced for the first time in order to reduce the number of competing entries.\n\nSeven countries in Central and Eastern Europe participated in Kvalifikacija za Millstreet, held in Ljubljana, Slovenia one month before the event.\n\nFollowing a vote amongst the seven competing countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia were chosen to head to the contest in Millstreet, Ireland, whilst Estonia, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia were forced to wait another year before being allowed to compete.\n\nA new relegation system was introduced for entry into the 1994 contest, with the lowest-placed countries being forced to sit out the following year's event to be replaced by countries which had not competed in the previous contest.\n\nThe bottom seven countries in 1993 were required to miss the following year's contest, and were replaced by the four unsuccessful countries in Kvalifikacija za Millstreet and new entries from Lithuania, Poland and Russia.\n\n**The \"Big Five\"**\n\nIn 1999, an exemption from relegation was introduced for France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, giving them an automatic right to compete in the 2000 contest and in all subsequent editions.\n\nThis group, as the highest-paying EBU members which significantly fund the contest each year, subsequently became known as the \"Big Four\" countries.\n\nThis group was expanded in 2011 when Italy began competing again, becoming the \"Big Five\".\n\nOriginally brought in to ensure that the financial contributions of the contest's biggest financial backers would not be missed, since the introduction of the semi-finals in 2004, the \"Big Five\" now instead automatically qualify for the final along with the host country.\n\n**Introduction of Semi-finals**\n\nAn influx of new countries applying for the 2003 contest resulted in the introduction of a semi-final from 2004, with the contest becoming a two-day event.\n\nThe top 10 countries in each year's final would qualify automatically to the following year's final, alongside the \"Big Four\", meaning all other countries would compete in the semi-final to compete for 10 qualification spots.\n\nThe 2004 contest in Istanbul, Turkey saw a record 36 countries competing, with new entries from Albania, Andorra, Belarus and Serbia and Montenegro and the return of previously relegated countries.\n\n**Entries and Participants**\n\nThe contest has been used as a launching point for artists who went on to achieve worldwide fame, and several of the world's best-selling artists are counted among past Eurovision Song Contest participants and winning artists.\n\nABBA, the 1974 winners for Sweden, have sold an estimated 380 million albums and singles since their contest win brought them to worldwide attention, with their winning song \"Waterloo\" selling over five million records.\n\nCeline Dion's win for Switzerland in 1988 helped launch her international career, particularly in the anglophone market, and she would go on to sell an estimated 200 million records worldwide.\n\nJulio Iglesias was relatively unknown when he represented Spain in 1970 and placed fourth, but worldwide success followed his Eurovision appearance, with an estimated 100 million records sold during his career.\n\nAustralian-British singer Olivia Newton-John represented the United Kingdom in 1974, placing fourth behind ABBA, but went on to sell an estimated 100 million records, win four Grammy Awards, and star in the critically and commercially successful musical film Grease.\n\n**Winners**\n\n71 songs from 27 countries have won the Eurovision Song Contest as of 2024.\n\nIreland and Sweden have recorded the most wins with seven each, followed by France, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands with five each.\n\nOf the 52 countries to have taken part, 24 have yet to win.\n\nOnly one contest has featured multiple winners in a single year: in 1969, four countries finished the contest with an equal number of points and were all declared winners due to the lack of tiebreak rules at the time.\n\n**Interval Acts and Guest Appearances**\n\nAlongside the song contest and appearances from local and international personalities, performances from non-competing artists and musicians have been included since the first edition, and have become a staple of the live show.\n\nThese performances have varied widely, previously featuring music, art, dance and circus performances, and past participants are regularly invited to perform, with the reigning champion traditionally returning each year to perform the previous year's winning song.\n\n**Criticism and Controversy**\n\nThe contest has been the subject of considerable criticism regarding both its musical content and what has been reported to be a political element to the event, and several controversial moments have been witnessed over the course of its history.\n\n**Musical Style and Presentation**\n\nCriticism has been levied against the musical quality of past competing entries, with a perception that certain music styles seen as being presented more often than others in an attempt to appeal to as many potential voters as possible among the international audience.\n\nPower ballads, folk rhythms and bubblegum pop have been considered staples of the contest in recent years, leading to allegations that the event has become formulaic.\n\nOther traits in past competing entries which have regularly been mocked by media and viewers include an abundance of key changes and lyrics about love and/or peace, as well as the pronunciation of English by non-native users of the language.\n\n**Political Controversies**\n\nAs artists and songs ultimately represent a country, the contest has seen several controversial moments where political tensions between competing countries as a result of frozen conflicts, and in some cases open warfare, are reflected in the performances and voting.\n\n**Political and Geographical Voting**\n\nThe contest has been described as containing political elements in its voting process, a perception that countries will give votes more frequently and in higher quantities to other countries based on political relationships, rather than the musical merits of the songs themselves.\n\nNumerous studies and academic papers have been written on this subject, which have corroborated that certain countries form \"clusters\" or \"cliques\" by frequently voting in the same way.\n\n**LGBT Visibility**\n\nEurovision has had a long-held fan base in the LGBT community, and contest organisers have actively worked to include these fans in the event since the 1990s.\n\nPaul Oscar became the contest's first openly gay artist to compete when he represented Iceland in 1997.\n\nIsrael's Dana International, the contest's first trans performer, became the first LGBT artist to win in 1998.\n\nIn 2021, Nikkie de Jager became the first trans person to host the contest.\n\n**Cultural Influence**\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest has amassed a global following and sees annual audience figures of between 100 and 600 million.\n\nThe contest has become a cultural influence worldwide since its first years.\n\nIt is regularly described as having kitsch appeal, and is included as a topic of parody in television sketches and in stage performances at the Edinburgh Fringe and Melbourne Comedy festivals amongst others.\n\nSeveral films have been created which celebrate the contest, including Eytan Fox's 2013 Israeli comedy Cupcakes, and the Netflix 2020 musical comedy, Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga, produced with backing from the EBU and starring Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams.\n\n**Special Events and Related Competitions**\n\nSeveral anniversary events, and related contests under the \"Eurovision Live Events\" brand, have been organised by the EBU with its member broadcasters.\n\nIn addition, participating broadcasters have occasionally commissioned special Eurovision programmes for their home audiences, and a number of other imitator contests have been developed outside of the EBU framework, on both a national and international level.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Eurovision_Song_Contest\" following this outline:\n\n\nOrigins and history\nThe Eurovision Song Contest was developed by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as an experiment in live television broadcasting and a way to produce cheaper programming for national broadcasting organisations [1] [2] The word \"Eurovision\" was first used by British journalist George Campey in the London Evening Standard in 1951, when he referred to a BBC programme being relayed by Dutch television [3] [4] Following several events broadcast internationally via the Eurovision transmission network in the early 1950s, including the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953, an EBU committee, headed by Marcel Bezençon, was formed in January 1955 to investigate new initiatives for cooperation between broadcasters, which approved for further study a European song competition from an idea initially proposed by RAI manager Sergio Pugliese [4] [5] [6] The EBU's general assembly agreed to the organising of the song contest in October 1955, under the initial title of the European Grand Prix, and accepted a proposal by the Swiss delegation to host the event in Lugano in the spring of 1956 [3] [4] [7] The Italian Sanremo Music Festival, held since 1951, was used as a basis for the initial planning of the contest, with several amendments and additions given its international nature [3]\n\n\nNaming\nOver the years the name used to describe the contest, and used on the official logo for each edition, has evolved The first contests were produced under the name of Grand Prix Eurovision de la Chanson Européenne in French and as the Eurovision Song Contest Grand Prix in English, with similar variations used in the languages of each of the broadcasting countries From 1968, the English name dropped the 'Grand Prix' from the name, with the French name being aligned as the Concours Eurovision de la Chanson, first used in 1973 [19] [34] [35] The contest's official brand guidance specifies that translations of the name may be used depending on national tradition and brand recognition in the competing countries, but that the official name Eurovision Song Contest is always preferred; the contest is commonly referred to in English by the abbreviation \"Eurovision\", and in internal documents by the acronym \"ESC\" [36]\n\n\nFormat\nOriginal songs representing participating countries are performed in a live television programme broadcast via the Eurovision and Euroradio networks simultaneously to all countries A \"country\" as a participant is represented by one television broadcaster from that country, a member of the European Broadcasting Union, and is typically that country's national public broadcasting organisation [37] The programme is staged by one of the participant countries and is broadcast from an auditorium in the selected host city [38] Since 2008, each contest is typically formed of three live television shows held over one week: two semi-finals are held on the Tuesday and Thursday, followed by a final on the Saturday All participating countries compete in one of the two semi-finals, except for the host country of that year's contest and the contest's biggest financial contributors known as the \"Big Five\"—France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom [37] [39] The remaining countries are split between the two semi-finals, and the 10 highest-scoring entries in each qualify to produce 26 countries competing in the final [37] Since the introduction of the semi-final round in 2004, Luxembourg and Ukraine are the only countries outside of the \"Big Five\" to have qualified for the final of every contest they have competed in.\n\n\nParticipation\nActive members (as opposed to associate members) of the European Broadcasting Union are eligible to participate; active members are those who are located in states that fall within the European Broadcasting Area, or are member states of the Council of Europe [50] Active members include media organisations whose broadcasts are often made available to at least 98% of households in their own country which are equipped to receive such transmissions [51] Associate member broadcasters may be eligible to compete, dependent on approval by the contest's Reference Group [52]\n\n\nHosting\nThe winning country traditionally hosts the following year's event, with some exceptions since 1958 [56] [19] Hosting the contest can be seen as a unique opportunity for promoting the host country as a tourist destination and can provide benefits to the local economy and tourism sectors of the host city [57] However, there is a perception reflected in popular culture that some countries wish to avoid the costly burden of hosting – sometimes resulting in them sending deliberately subpar entries with no chance of winning This belief is mentioned in Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga (2020) and a plot point in the Father Ted episode \"A Song for Europe\" (1996) [58]  Preparations for each year's contest typically begin at the conclusion of the previous year's contest, with the winning country's head of delegation receiving a welcome package of information related to hosting the contest at the winner's press conference [37] [59] [60] Eurovision is a non-profit event, and financing is typically achieved through a fee from each participating broadcaster, contributions from the host broadcaster and the host city, and commercial revenues from sponsorships, ticket sales, televoting and merchandise [55]\n\n\nEurovision logo and theme\nUntil 2004, each edition of the contest used its own logo and visual identity as determined by the respective host broadcaster To create a consistent visual identity, a generic logo was introduced ahead of the 2004 contest This is typically accompanied by a unique theme artwork designed for each individual contest by the host broadcaster, with the flag of the host country placed prominently in the centre of the Eurovision heart [36] The original logo was designed by the London-based agency JM International, and received a revamp in 2014 by the Amsterdam-based Cityzen Agency for the contest's 60th edition [67] [68]\n\n\nPreparations\nPreparations in the host venue typically begin approximately six weeks before the final, to accommodate building works and technical rehearsals before the arrival of the competing artists [76] Delegations will typically arrive in the host city two to three weeks before the live show, and each participating broadcaster nominates a head of delegation, responsible for coordinating the movements of their delegation and being that country's representative to the EBU [46] [77] Members of each country's delegation include performers, composers, lyricists, members of the press, and—in the years where a live orchestra was present—a conductor [78] Present if desired is a commentator, who provides commentary of the event for their country's radio and/or television feed in their country's own language in dedicated booths situated around the back of the arena behind the audience [79] [80]\n\n\nRules\nThe contest is organised annually by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), together with the participating broadcaster of the host country The event is monitored by an Executive Supervisor appointed by the EBU, and by the Reference Group which represents all participating broadcasters, who are each represented by a nominated Head of Delegation [92] The current Executive Supervisor is Martin Österdahl, who took over the role from Jon Ola Sand in May 2020 [93] A detailed set of rules is written by the EBU for each contest and approved by the Reference Group These rules have changed over time, and typically outline, among other points, the eligibility of the competing songs, the format of the contest, and the voting system to be used to determine the winner and how the results will be presented [46]\n\n\nSong eligibility and languages\nAll competing songs must have a duration of three minutes or less [46] This rule applies only to the version performed during the live shows [94] In order to be considered eligible, competing songs in a given year's contest must not have been released commercially before the first day of September of the previous year [46] All competing entries must include vocals and lyrics of some kind, a cappella songs and purely instrumental pieces are not allowed [95] Competing entries may be performed in any language, be that natural or constructed, and participating broadcasters are free to decide the language in which their entry may be performed [46]\n\n\nArtist eligibility and performances\nThe rules for the first contest specified that only solo performers were permitted to enter; [104] this criterion was changed the following year to permit duos to compete, and groups were subsequently permitted for the first time in 1971 [105] [106] Currently the number of people permitted on stage during competing performances is limited to a maximum of six, and no live animals are allowed [46] Since 1990, all contestants must be aged 16 or over on the day of the live show in which they perform [107] Sandra Kim, the winner in 1986 at the age of 13, shall remain the contest's youngest winner while this rule remains in place [108] [109] There is no limit on the nationality or country of birth of the competing artists, and participating broadcasters are free to select an artist from any country; several winning artists have subsequently held a different nationality or were born in a different country to that which they represented [110] [10] No performer may compete for more than one country in a given year [46] There is no restriction regarding performers who have participated in past events competing again – whether for the same country or a different one It is even possible for a winning performer to try and defend their title in the next edition, as happened when 2010 winner Lena competed again in 2011 [111] However, in the history of the contest only two individuals have won more than once as a performer – Johnny Logan in 1980 and 1987 for Ireland, and Loreen in 2012 and 2023 for Sweden [112]\n\n\nRunning order\nSince 2013, the order in which the competing countries perform has been determined by the contest's producers, and submitted to the EBU Executive Supervisor and Reference Group for approval before public announcement This was changed from a random draw used in previous years in order to provide a better experience for television viewers and ensure all countries stand out by avoiding instances where songs of a similar style or tempo are performed in sequence [118]\n\n\nVoting\nSince 2023, the voting system used to determine the results of the contest has worked on the basis of positional voting [126] [127] Each country awards 1–8, 10 and 12 points to the ten favourite songs as voted for by that country's general public or assembled jury, with the most preferred song receiving 12 points In the semi-finals, each country awards one set of points, based primarily on the votes cast by that country's viewing public via telephone, SMS or the official Eurovision app, while in the final, each country awards two sets of points, with one set awarded by the viewers and another awarded by a jury panel comprising five music professionals from that country [47] [126] Since 2023, viewers in non-participating countries have also been able to vote during the contest, with those viewers able to cast votes via an online platform, which are then aggregated and awarded as one set of points from an \"extra country\" for the overall public vote [128] [129] This system is a modification of that used since 1975, when the \"12 points\" system was first introduced but with one set of points per country, and a similar system used since 2016 where two sets of points were awarded in both the semi-finals and final [130] [131] National juries and the public in each country are not allowed to vote for their own country, a rule first introduced in 1957 [47] [105]\n\n\nPresentation of the votes\nSince 1957, each country's votes have been announced during a special voting segment as part of the contest's broadcast, with a selected spokesperson assigned to announce the results of their country's vote [47] This spokesperson is typically well known in their country; previous spokespersons have included former Eurovision artists and presenters [136] Historically, the announcements were made through telephone lines from the countries of origin, with satellite links employed for the first time in 1994, allowing the spokespersons to be seen visually by the audience and TV spectators [137]\n\n\nBroadcasting\nParticipating broadcasters are required to air live the semi-final in which they compete, or in the case of the automatic finalists the semi-final in which they are required to vote, and the final, in its entirety; this includes all competing songs, the voting recap containing short clips of the performances, the voting procedure or semi-final qualification reveal, and the reprise of the winning song in the final [46] [115] [140] Since 1999, broadcasters who wished to do so were given the opportunity to provide advertising during short, non-essential hiatuses in the show's schedule [114] In exceptional circumstances, such as due to developing emergency situations, participating broadcasters may delay or postpone broadcast of the event [141] [142] Should a broadcaster fail to air a show as expected in any other scenario they may be subject to sanctions by the EBU [143] [144] Several broadcasters in countries that are unable to compete have previously aired the contest in their markets [145] [146] [147]\n\n\nExpansion of the contest\nFrom the original seven countries which entered the first contest in 1956, the number of competing countries has steadily grown over time 18 countries participated in the contest's tenth edition in 1965, and by 1990, 22 countries were regularly competing each year [97] [156]\n\n\nPre-selections and relegation\n29 countries registered to take part in the 1993 contest, a figure the EBU considered unable to fit reasonably into a single TV show A pre-selection method was subsequently introduced for the first time in order to reduce the number of competing entries, with seven countries in Central and Eastern Europe participating in Kvalifikacija za Millstreet, held in Ljubljana, Slovenia one month before the event Following a vote amongst the seven competing countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia were chosen to head to the contest in Millstreet, Ireland, whilst Estonia, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia were forced to wait another year before being allowed to compete [63] [158] A new relegation system was introduced for entry into the 1994 contest, with the lowest-placed countries being forced to sit out the following year's event to be replaced by countries which had not competed in the previous contest The bottom seven countries in 1993 were required to miss the following year's contest, and were replaced by the four unsuccessful countries in Kvalifikacija za Millstreet and new entries from Lithuania, Poland and Russia [63] [137] [159]\n\n\nThe \"Big Five\"\nIn 1999, an exemption from relegation was introduced for France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, giving them an automatic right to compete in the 2000 contest and in all subsequent editions This group, as the highest-paying EBU members which significantly fund the contest each year, subsequently became known as the \"Big Four\" countries [102] [103] [114] This group was expanded in 2011 when Italy began competing again, becoming the \"Big Five\" [164] Originally brought in to ensure that the financial contributions of the contest's biggest financial backers would not be missed, since the introduction of the semi-finals in 2004, the \"Big Five\" now instead automatically qualify for the final along with the host country [165] [166]\n\n\nIntroduction of semi-finals\nAn influx of new countries applying for the 2003 contest resulted in the introduction of a semi-final from 2004, with the contest becoming a two-day event [171] [172] The top 10 countries in each year's final would qualify automatically to the following year's final, alongside the \"Big Four\", meaning all other countries would compete in the semi-final to compete for 10 qualification spots [165] The 2004 contest in Istanbul, Turkey saw a record 36 countries competing, with new entries from Albania, Andorra, Belarus and Serbia and Montenegro and the return of previously relegated countries [165] [173] The format of this semi-final remained similar to the final proper, taking place a few days before the final; following the performances and the voting window, the names of the 10 countries with the highest number of points, which would therefore qualify for the final, were announced at the end of the show, revealed in a random order by the contest's presenters [165] [173]\n\n\nEntries and participants\n The contest has been used as a launching point for artists who went on to achieve worldwide fame, and several of the world's best-selling artists are counted among past Eurovision Song Contest participants and winning artists ABBA, the 1974 winners for Sweden, have sold an estimated 380 million albums and singles since their contest win brought them to worldwide attention, with their winning song \"Waterloo\" selling over five million records [179] [180] Celine Dion's win for Switzerland in 1988 helped launch her international career, particularly in the anglophone market, and she would go on to sell an estimated 200 million records worldwide [138] [181] Julio Iglesias was relatively unknown when he represented Spain in 1970 and placed fourth, but worldwide success followed his Eurovision appearance, with an estimated 100 million records sold during his career [182] [183] Australian-British singer Olivia Newton-John represented the United Kingdom in 1974, placing fourth behind ABBA, but went on to sell an estimated 100 million records, win four Grammy Awards, and star in the critically and commercially successful musical film Grease [184] [185]\n\n\nWinners\n71 songs from 27 countries have won the Eurovision Song Contest as of 2024 [update] [10] Ireland and Sweden have recorded the most wins with seven each, followed by France, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands with five each [9] [10] Of the 52 countries to have taken part, 24 [a] have yet to win [19] Only one contest has featured multiple winners in a single year: in 1969, four countries [b] finished the contest with an equal number of points and were all declared winners due to the lack of tiebreak rules at the time [9] [253] A majority of winning songs have been performed in English, particularly since the rule requiring native-language songs was abolished in 1999: since then, only seven winning songs have been performed either fully or partially in a language other than English [19]\n\n\nInterval acts and guest appearances\nAlongside the song contest and appearances from local and international personalities, performances from non-competing artists and musicians have been included since the first edition, [43] [263] and have become a staple of the live show [262] These performances have varied widely, previously featuring music, art, dance and circus performances, and past participants are regularly invited to perform, with the reigning champion traditionally returning each year to perform the previous year's winning song [43] [264]\n\n\nCriticism and controversy\nThe contest has been the subject of considerable criticism regarding both its musical content and what has been reported to be a political element to the event, and several controversial moments have been witnessed over the course of its history [289]\n\n\nMusical style and presentation\nCriticism has been levied against the musical quality of past competing entries, with a perception that certain music styles seen as being presented more often than others in an attempt to appeal to as many potential voters as possible among the international audience [290] Power ballads, folk rhythms and bubblegum pop have been considered staples of the contest in recent years, leading to allegations that the event has become formulaic [291] [292] Other traits in past competing entries which have regularly been mocked by media and viewers include an abundance of key changes and lyrics about love and/or peace, as well as the pronunciation of English by non-native users of the language [290] [293] [294] Given Eurovision is principally a television show, over the years competing performances have attempted to attract the viewers' attention through means other than music, and elaborate lighting displays, pyrotechnics, and extravagant on-stage theatrics and costumes having become a common sight at recent contests; [295] criticism of these tactics have been levied as being a method of distracting the viewer from the weak musical quality of some of the competing entries [296]\n\n\nPolitical controversies\nAs artists and songs ultimately represent a country, the contest has seen several controversial moments where political tensions between competing countries as a result of frozen conflicts, and in some cases open warfare, are reflected in the performances and voting [303]\n\n\nPolitical and geographical voting\nThe contest has been described as containing political elements in its voting process, a perception that countries will give votes more frequently and in higher quantities to other countries based on political relationships, rather than the musical merits of the songs themselves [338] [339] Numerous studies and academic papers have been written on this subject, which have corroborated that certain countries form \"clusters\" or \"cliques\" by frequently voting in the same way; one study concludes that voting blocs can play a crucial role in deciding the winner of the contest, with evidence that on at least two occasions bloc voting was a pivotal factor in the vote for the winning song [340] [341] Other views on these \"blocs\" argue that certain countries will allocate high points to others based on similar musical tastes, shared cultural links and a high degree of similarity and mutual intelligibility between languages, and are therefore more likely to appreciate and vote for the competing songs from these countries based on these factors, rather than political relationships specifically [342] [343] Analysis on other voting patterns have revealed examples which indicate voting preferences among countries based on shared religion, as well as \"patriotic voting\", particularly since the introduction of televoting in 1997, where foreign nationals vote for their country of origin [343] [344]\n\n\nLGBT visibility\nEurovision has had a long-held fan base in the LGBT community, and contest organisers have actively worked to include these fans in the event since the 1990s [355] Paul Oscar became the contest's first openly gay artist to compete when he represented Iceland in 1997 Israel's Dana International, the contest's first trans performer, became the first LGBT artist to win in 1998 [356] [132] In 2021, Nikkie de Jager became the first trans person to host the contest [357]\n\n\nCultural influence\nThe Eurovision Song Contest has amassed a global following and sees annual audience figures of between 100 and 600 million [380] [381] The contest has become a cultural influence worldwide since its first years It is regularly described as having kitsch appeal, and is included as a topic of parody in television sketches and in stage performances at the Edinburgh Fringe and Melbourne Comedy festivals amongst others [292] [296] [382] [383] Several films have been created which celebrate the contest, including Eytan Fox's 2013 Israeli comedy Cupcakes, and the Netflix 2020 musical comedy, Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga, produced with backing from the EBU and starring Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams [384] [385] [386]\n\n\nSpecial events and related competitions\nSeveral anniversary events, and related contests under the \"Eurovision Live Events\" brand, have been organised by the EBU with its member broadcasters [396] In addition, participating broadcasters have occasionally commissioned special Eurovision programmes for their home audiences, and a number of other imitator contests have been developed outside of the EBU framework, on both a national and international level [397] [398]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

offensive weapons around him The 49ers used their top draft choice on tight end Vernon Davis They also upgraded their offensive backfield, trading underachieving running back Kevan Barlow to the Jets, making Frank Gore the feature back.\n\n\n2007 season\nSmith entered the 2007 season learning under a third offensive coordinator in three seasons Norv Turner was hired as the head coach by the San Diego Chargers Jim Hostler replaced Turner Hostler's system involved a mixture of the offensive system installed by Turner with elements of the West Coast offense installed by Mike McCarthy for the 2005 season During the off-season, the 49ers added wide receivers Darrell Jackson, Ashley Lelie, and rookie Jason Hill as new offensive targets for Smith.\n\n\n2008 season\nSmith entered training camp

Smith would be learning under a fourth different offensive coordinator in four seasons; Jim Hostler was fired and replaced by former Detroit Lions offensive coordinator and St Louis Rams offensive coordinator/head coach Mike Martz Unlike the previous three seasons, where offensive continuity was somewhat maintained, Martz's system was completely different Smith lost the starting job in training camp to O'Sullivan, [37] who was elevated to starting quarterback, partly due to his familiarity with Martz's offense when he was a member of the Detroit Lions.\n\n\n2009 season\nAfter the pay cut, Smith said that he was ready to compete for the starting quarterback spot, primarily against Shaun Hill [43]\n\n\n2010 season\nSmith entered the 2010 season as the starting quarterback For the first time in his career, he returned under the same offensive coordinator from the previous season, as Raye was retained However, continuity in a poor system resulted in the team starting 0–5, and on September 27, Raye was fired and replaced by quarterbacks coach Mike Johnson Under Johnson, Smith was expected to run a variation of the spread offense that he ran in college The 49ers continued to build their team having now drafted Anthony Davis and Mike Iupati with their two first-round picks to provide more protection On September 8, Coach Singletary announced that Smith was named one of the team's captains [51]\n\n\n2011 season\nThe 49ers hired Jim Harbaugh as the new head coach, and Greg Roman replaced Johnson as the new offensive coordinator Harbaugh, a former quarterback, was the best coach the 49ers had since Norv Turner in Smith's second season [63] Harbaugh made it known to Smith that he was welcomed back on the team Smith's family wanted him to leave San Francisco [33] Although he was unsigned, Smith organized the players' workouts during the 2011 NFL lockout and helped to install Harbaugh's new offense [64] After the lockout ended, Smith signed a one-year $5 million contract with the 49ers [65] [66] Smith was named the starting quarterback heading into the regular season, and Harbaugh believed Smith could succeed in the coach's West Coast offense [66]\n\n\n2012 season\nSmith became a free agent following the 2011 season The 49ers were reported to be interested in signing Peyton Manning, who had just been released by the rebuilding Indianapolis Colts, leading Smith to visit the Miami Dolphins, reportedly with the intent to sign with the Dolphins if the 49ers signed Manning Shortly after Manning made the decision to join the Denver Broncos, Smith signed a three-year contract worth $24 million to remain with the 49ers [83] During the off-season, the 49ers added wide receivers Randy Moss and Mario Manningham in free agency, and A J Jenkins in the first round of the 2012 NFL draft to improve a passing game that lacked production from the receivers the previous season Smith began the 2012 season as the 49ers' starting quarterback Smith completed 18-of-19 passes for 232 yards and three touchdowns without an interception in a 24–3 Monday night win over Arizona, and San Francisco was 6–2 after eight games [84] In the following game against the

Player of the Year [8] Smith posted a 21–1 record as a starter in college, while leading a high-powered spread offense under head coach Urban Meyer [9] [10] He led the Utes to victories in the 2003 Liberty Bowl and the 2005 Fiesta Bowl [11] [12] Smith earned a bachelor's degree in economics in two years and began work on a master's degree before being drafted [13] [14] [15]\n\n\nCollege statistics\nAt the NFL combine, Smith recorded a 4.7 time in the 40-yard dash, and had a 32-inch vertical leap [19] He also scored 40 out of 50 on the Wonderlic exam [20]\n\n\nProfessional career\nAt the NFL combine, Smith recorded a 4.7 time in the 40-yard dash, and had a 32-inch vertical leap [19] He also scored 40 out of 50 on the Wonderlic exam [20]\n\n\nPre-draft\nAt the NFL combine, Smith recorded a 4.7 time in the 40-yard dash, and had a 32-inch vertical leap [19] He also scored 40 out of 50 on the Wonderlic exam [20]\n\n\nSan Francisco 49ers\nThe San Francisco 49ers, who held the first overall pick, had hired a head coach with a strong personality in Mike Nolan Nolan also evaluated California quarterback Aaron Rodgers, but did not believe that Rodgers's attitude could co-exist with him [21] Smith was the first overall pick in the 2005 NFL draft, selected by the San Francisco 49ers [22] In July 2005, Smith agreed to a six-year, $49.5 million contract with the 49ers; the contract included $24 million in guaranteed money.\n\n\n2005 season\nThe San Francisco 49ers, who held the first overall pick, had hired a head coach with a strong personality in Mike Nolan Nolan also evaluated California quarterback Aaron Rodgers, but did not believe that Rodgers's attitude could co-exist with him [21] Smith was the first overall pick in the 2005 NFL draft, selected by the San Francisco 49ers [22] In July 2005, Smith agreed to a six-year, $49.5 million contract with the 49ers; the contract included $24 million in guaranteed money.\n\n\n2006 season\nAfter the challenges faced in his rookie campaign, Smith went into the 2006 season with a new offensive coordinator (Norv Turner) and an improved set of offensive weapons around him The 49ers used their top draft choice on tight end Vernon Davis They also upgraded their offensive backfield, trading underachieving running back Kevan Barlow to the Jets, making Frank Gore the feature back.\n\n\n2007 season\nSmith entered the 2007 season learning under a third offensive coordinator in three seasons Norv Turner was hired as the head coach by the San Diego Chargers Jim Hostler replaced Turner Hostler's system involved a mixture of the offensive system installed by Turner with elements of the West Coast offense installed by Mike McCarthy for the 2005 season During the off-season, the 49ers added wide receivers Darrell Jackson, Ashley Lelie, and rookie Jason Hill as new offensive targets for Smith.\n\n\n2008 season\nSmith entered training camp competing for the starting quarterback job with Shaun Hill, who won both of the games he started in 2007, before suffering a back injury against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and journeyman J T O'Sullivan Smith would be learning under a fourth different offensive coordinator in four seasons; Jim Hostler was fired and replaced by former Detroit Lions offensive coordinator and St Louis Rams offensive coordinator/head coach Mike Martz Unlike the previous three seasons, where offensive continuity was somewhat maintained, Martz's system was completely different Smith lost the starting job in training camp to O'Sullivan, [37] who was elevated to starting quarterback, partly due to his familiarity with Martz's offense when he was a member of the Detroit Lions.\n\n\n2009 season\nAfter the pay cut, Smith said that he was ready to compete for the starting quarterback spot, primarily against Shaun Hill [43]\n\n\n2010 season\nSmith entered the 2010 season as the starting quarterback For the first time in his career, he returned under the same offensive coordinator from the previous season, as Raye was retained However, continuity in a poor system resulted in the team starting 0–5, and on September 27, Raye was fired and replaced by quarterbacks coach Mike Johnson Under Johnson, Smith was expected to run a variation of the spread offense that he ran in college The 49ers continued to build their team having now drafted Anthony Davis and Mike Iupati with their two first-round picks to provide more protection On September 8, Coach Singletary announced that Smith was named one of the team's captains [51]\n\n\n2011 season\nThe 49ers hired Jim Harbaugh as the new head coach, and Greg Roman replaced Johnson as the new offensive coordinator Harbaugh, a former quarterback, was the best coach the 49ers had since Norv Turner in Smith's second season [63] Harbaugh made it known to Smith that he was welcomed back on the team Smith's family wanted him to leave San Francisco [33] Although he was unsigned, Smith organized the players' workouts during the 2011 NFL lockout and helped to install Harbaugh's new offense [64] After the lockout ended, Smith signed a one-year $5 million contract with the 49ers [65] [66] Smith was named the starting quarterback heading into the regular season, and Harbaugh believed Smith could succeed in the coach's West Coast offense [66]\n\n\n2012 season\nSmith became a free agent following the 2011 season The 49ers were reported to be interested in signing Peyton Manning, who had just been released by the rebuilding Indianapolis Colts, leading Smith to visit the Miami Dolphins, reportedly with the intent to sign with the Dolphins if the 49ers signed Manning Shortly after Manning made the decision to join the Denver Broncos, Smith signed a three-year contract worth $24 million to remain with the 49ers [83] During the off-season, the 49ers added wide receivers Randy Moss and Mario Manningham in free agency, and A J Jenkins in the first round of the 2012 NFL draft to improve a passing game that lacked production from the receivers the previous season Smith began the 2012 season as the 49ers' starting quarterback Smith completed 18-of-19 passes for 232 yards and three touchdowns without an interception in a 24–3 Monday night win over Arizona, and San Francisco was 6–2 after eight games [84] In the following game against the St Louis Rams, Smith suffered a concussion in the second quarter, throwing a touchdown with blurred vision before exiting the game He was replaced by Colin Kaepernick, and the game ended in a 24–24 tie [85]\n\n\nKansas City Chiefs\nOn February 27, 2013, the 49ers agreed to trade Smith to the Kansas City Chiefs for the Chiefs' second round pick in the 2013 NFL draft and a conditional pick in the 2014 NFL draft [96] The deal became official at the beginning of the new league year on March 12 [97]\n\n\n2013 season\nOn February 27, 2013, the 49ers agreed to trade Smith to the Kansas City Chiefs for the Chiefs' second round pick in the 2013 NFL draft and a conditional pick in the 2014 NFL draft [96] The deal became official at the beginning of the new league year on March 12 [97]\n\n\n2014 season\nOn August 31, 2014, Smith and the Chiefs agreed to a four-year contract extension [104] Smith appeared in 15 games and completed 65.3% of his passes in the 2014 season while throwing for 3,265 yards and 18 touchdowns to only six interceptions [105] However, the Chiefs finished with a 9–7 record and did not qualify for the playoffs [106]\n\n\n2015 season\nAfter another strong season in 2015, Smith was elected to the Pro Bowl as an alternate, but turned down the offer He once again led the Chiefs to the playoffs, where they defeated the Houston Texans 30–0 in the Wild Card Round Smith threw for 190 yards, a touchdown, and an interception in the victory over the Texans He also rushed five times for 27 yards, and had a 64-yard scramble, which was called back due to a holding penalty [107] The Chiefs went on to lose 27–20 against the New England Patriots in the Divisional Round [108] The Chiefs became the first team ever to start the season 1–5 and win a playoff game At the end of the season, Sports Illustrated named him the best looking quarterback in the NFL, an honor previously won by Tom Brady [109] He was named team MVP for 2015 alongside safety Eric Berry In the regular season Smith threw for 3,486 yards, 20 touchdowns, and only seven interceptions, with a completion percentage of 65.3, passer rating of 95.4, and 7.4 yards per attempt He also rushed 84 times for 498 yards, two touchdowns, and an average of 5.9 yards per carry [110] At the end of the season, he was recognized as the 81st best player by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016 [111]\n\n\n2016 season\nIn Week 1, Smith led a fourth quarter comeback over the San Diego Chargers to win the game 33–27 in overtime after facing a 24–3 third quarter deficit Smith won the game in overtime with a two-yard rushing touchdown This became the largest comeback win in Chiefs history as the Chiefs started the 2016 season on a positive note [112] In 2016, Smith posted a career-high passing yards with 3,502 and a career-high 328 completions despite missing one game In addition, he ran for a career-high five touchdowns, with three of them coming in the last three games [113] He helped lead the Chiefs to the postseason, where they lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Divisional Round [114] He was ranked 81st by his fellow players, for the second consecutive year, on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017 [115]\n\n\n2017 season\nDuring the season opener, Smith finished with 368 passing yards and four touchdowns as the Chiefs pulled off a 42–27 road victory over the defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots [116] [117] Smith's 368 passing yards and four passing touchdowns were both the second most in a game in his career [118] Smith's performance in Week 1 led all eligible passers in yards and earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week, marking the first time that he won the award [119] During Week 13 against the New York Jets, Smith finished with 366 passing yards and four touchdowns After the first 2 minutes and 46 seconds had passed in the first quarter, Smith quickly threw two touchdown passes to Travis Kelce However, the performance was overshadowed as defensive penalties and errors proved to be costly as the Chiefs lost on the road by a score of 38–31 [120] With his performance against the Jets, Smith became the first player in the modern era to have both a 70-yard pass and a 70-yard run in the same game.\n\n\nWashington Redskins / Football Team\nOn January 30, 2018, Smith was traded to the Washington Redskins in exchange for cornerback Kendall Fuller and a third-round pick (78th overall) in the 2018 NFL draft [128] The trade became official on March 14, the first day of the new league year [129] Smith subsequently signed a four-year, $94 million

[130]\n\n\nLeg injury\n\"I remember a really funny feeling in my leg It wasn't like I knew it was broken immediately It went fuzzy That's what it felt like And then it really was the visual when I looked down and could see, you know, that my leg obviously wasn't straight anymore that told me that I had broken it.\"\n\n\n2019 season\nSmith was placed on the team's physically unable to perform (PUP) reserve list in 2019, missing the entire season [142] Despite the severity of the injury which many thought he would never come back from, in early 2020 he affirmed his intent to return [143] An ESPN documentary following his recovery, Project 11, aired in May 2020 [144]\n\n\n2020 return and Comeback Player of the Year\nSmith was cleared by his doctors to resume football activities in July

{"title": "Aisha", "content": "\nSources\n\n\nEarly life\nAisha was born in Mecca c. 613–614 [20] [21] She was the daughter of Abu Bakr and Umm Ruman, two of Muhammad's most trusted companions [8] No sources offer much more information about Aisha's childhood years [22] [23]\n\n\nMarriage to Muhammad\nMuhammad said that he had twice seen Aisha in his dreams, being carried in a silk cloth by an angel who told him that she would be his wife Muhammad believed that if the dreams were from God, he would make them come true [24] [25] Following the death of his first wife, Khadija bint Khuwaylid, his aunt Khawlah bint Hakim suggested that he marry Aisha [26] [27] Aisha's father Abu Bakr was at first unsure about marrying his daughter to Muhammad; he thought they were brothers Muhammad clarified that they were merely brothers in religion, and it was legal for him to marry Aisha [28] [27] Aisha's engagement to Jubayr ibn Mut'im, a boy close to her age, was then annulled [29] [27] Orientalist W Montgomery Watt suggests that Muhammad hoped to strengthen his ties with Abu Bakr; [14] the strengthening of ties commonly served as a basis for marriage in Arabian culture [30]\n\n\nAge at marriage and consummation\nIslamic sources of the classical era list Aisha's age at the time of her marriage as six or seven and nine or ten at its consummation In a hadith from Sahih al-Bukhari, Aisha recollects having been married at six years of age [32] Ibn Sa'd's biography holds her age at the time of marriage as between six and seven, and gives her age at consummation to be nine while Ibn Hisham's biography of Muhammad suggests she may have been ten years old at consummation [33] Al-Tabari notes Aisha to have stayed with her parents after the marriage and consummated the relationship at nine years of age since she was young and sexually immature at the time of marriage; however, elsewhere Tabari appears to suggest that she was born during the Jahiliyyah (before 610 CE), which would translate to an age of about twelve or more at marriage [34] [35]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn most Muslim traditions, Khadija bint Khuwaylid is described as Muhammad's most beloved and favored wife; Sunni tradition places Aisha as second only to Khadija [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] There are several hadiths, or stories or sayings of Muhammad, that support this belief One relates that when a companion asked Muhammad, \"who is the person you love most in the world?\" he responded, \"Aisha.\" [52] Others relate that Muhammad built Aisha's apartment so that her door opened directly into the mosque, [53] [54] and that she was the only woman with whom Muhammad received revelations [55] [56] They bathed in the same water, and he prayed while she lay stretched out in front of him [57]\n\n\nRelationship with Muhammad\nIn most Muslim traditions, Khadija bint Khuwaylid is described as Muhammad's most beloved and favored wife; Sunni tradition places Aisha as second only to Khadija [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] There are several hadiths, or stories or sayings of Muhammad, that support this belief One relates that when a companion asked Muhammad, \"who is the person you love most in

Muhammad received revelations [55] [56] They bathed in the same water, and he prayed while she lay stretched out in front of him [57]\n\n\nAccusation of adultery\nWhen Muhammad and his followers carried out a raid on the Banu Mustaliq tribe, he brought along Aisha, who was 13 years old at the time She was carried in a closed litter on the back of a camel Aisha recounted that when the raiding party was resting at night on the way home to Medina from the successful operation, she went out to relieve herself After doing so and returning to her litter, she realized that her necklace was missing, so she traced her way back to look for it By the time she found it, the convoy had already left, thinking she was in the litter Assuming that they would notice her absence and return to look for her, Aisha decided to stay where she was [65] [66]\n\n\nDeath of Muhammad\nAisha remained Muhammad's favorite wife throughout his life When he became ill and suspected that he was probably going to die, he began to ask his wives whose apartment he was to stay in next They eventually figured out that he was trying to determine when he was due with Aisha, and they then allowed him to retire there He remained in Aisha's apartment until his death, and his last breath was taken as he lay in the arms of Aisha, his second most beloved [clarification needed] wife [81] [82] [83] [84] [85]\n\n\nPolitical career\nAisha's importance to revitalizing the Arab tradition and leadership among the Arab women highlights her magnitude within Islam [86] Aisha became involved in the politics of early Islam and the first three caliphate reigns: Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, and ‘Uthman During a time in Islam when women were not expected or wanted to contribute outside the household, Aisha delivered public speeches, became directly involved in a war and even battles, and helped both men and women to understand the practices of Muhammad [47] [additional citation(s) needed]\n\n\nRole during caliphate\nAfter Muhammad's death in 632, Abu Bakr was appointed as the first caliph This matter of succession to Muhammad is extremely controversial to the Shia who believe that Ali had been appointed by Muhammad to lead while Sunni maintain that the public elected Abu Bakr [87] Abu Bakr had two advantages in achieving his new role: his long personal friendship with Muhammad and his role as a father-in-law As caliph, Abu Bakr was the first to set guidelines for the new position of authority [88]\n\n\nRole during first and second caliphates\nAfter Muhammad's death in 632, Abu Bakr was appointed as the first caliph This matter of succession to Muhammad is extremely controversial to the Shia who believe that Ali had been appointed by Muhammad to lead while Sunni maintain that the public elected Abu Bakr [87] Abu Bakr had two advantages in achieving his new role: his long personal friendship with Muhammad and his role as a father-in-law As caliph, Abu Bakr was the first to set guidelines for the new position of authority [88]\n\n\nFirst Fitna\nIn 656, Uthman's house was put under siege by about 1000 rebels Eventually the rebels broke into the house and murdered Uthman,

Ayesha) was one of the youngest wives of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and is considered one of the most influential women in Islamic history. She was known for her intelligence, courage, and strong personality, and played a significant role in the early Islamic community.\n\nSources\nAisha was born in Mecca c. 613-614 CE. She was the daughter of Abu Bakr, one of Muhammad's most trusted companions, and Umm Ruman. No sources offer much more information about Aisha's childhood years.\n\nMarriage to Muhammad\nMuhammad said that he had twice seen Aisha in his dreams, being carried in a silk cloth by an angel who told him that she would be his wife. Muhammad believed that if the dreams were from God, he would make them come true. Following the death of his first wife, Khadija bint Khuwaylid, his aunt Khawlah bint Hakim suggested that he marry Aisha. Aisha's father Abu Bakr was at first unsure about marrying his daughter to Muhammad; he thought they were brothers. Muhammad clarified that they were merely brothers in religion, and it was legal for him to marry Aisha. Aisha's engagement to Jubayr ibn Mut'im, a boy close to her age, was then annulled.\n\nAge at Marriage and Consummation\nIslamic sources of the classical era list Aisha's age at the time of her marriage as six or seven, and nine or ten at its consummation. In a hadith from Sahih al-Bukhari, Aisha recollects having been married at six years of age. Ibn Sa'd's biography holds her age at the time of marriage as between six and seven, and gives her age at consummation to be nine. Ibn Hisham's biography of Muhammad suggests she may have been ten years old at consummation.\n\nPersonal Life\nIn most Muslim traditions, Khadija bint Khuwaylid is described as Muhammad's most beloved and favored wife; Sunni tradition places Aisha as second only to Khadija. There are several hadiths, or stories or sayings of Muhammad, that support this belief. One relates that when a companion asked Muhammad, \"who is the person you love most in the world?\" he responded, \"Aisha.\" Others relate that Muhammad built Aisha's apartment so that her door opened directly into the mosque, and that she was the only woman with whom Muhammad received revelations. They bathed in the same water, and he prayed while she lay stretched out in front of him.\n\nRelationship with Muhammad\nIn most Muslim traditions, Khadija bint Khuwaylid is described as Muhammad's most beloved and favored wife; Sunni tradition places Aisha as second only to Khadija. There are several hadiths, or stories or sayings of Muhammad, that support this belief. One relates that when a companion asked Muhammad, \"who is the person you love most in the world?\" he responded, \"Aisha.\" Others relate that Muhammad built Aisha's apartment so that her door opened directly into the mosque, and that she was the only woman with whom Muhammad received revelations. They bathed in the same water, and he prayed while she lay stretched out in front of him.\n\nAccusation of Adultery\nWhen Muhammad and his followers carried out a raid on the Banu Mustaliq tribe, he brought along Aisha, who was 13 years old at the time. She was carried in a closed litter on the back of a camel. Aisha recounted that when the raiding party was resting at night on the way home to Medina from the successful operation, she went out to relieve herself. After doing so and returning to her litter, she realized that her necklace was missing, so she traced her way back to look for it. By the time she found it, the convoy had already left, thinking she was in the litter. Assuming that they would notice her absence and return to look for her, Aisha decided to stay where she was.\n\nDeath of Muhammad\nAisha remained Muhammad's favorite wife throughout his life. When he became ill and suspected that he was probably going to die, he began to ask his wives whose apartment he was to stay in next. They eventually figured out that he was trying to determine when he was due with Aisha, and they then allowed him to retire there. He remained in Aisha's apartment until his death, and his last breath was taken as he lay in the arms of Aisha, his second most beloved wife.\n\nPolitical Career\nAisha's importance to revitalizing the Arab tradition and leadership among the Arab women highlights her magnitude within Islam. Aisha became involved in the politics of early Islam and the first three caliphate reigns: Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, and ‘Uthman. During a time in Islam when women were not expected or wanted to contribute outside the household, Aisha delivered public speeches, became directly involved in a war and even battles, and helped both men and women to understand the practices of Muhammad.\n\nRole During Caliphate\nAfter Muhammad's death in 632, Abu Bakr was appointed as the first caliph. This matter of succession to Muhammad is extremely controversial to the Shia who believe that Ali had been appointed by Muhammad to lead while Sunni maintain that the public elected Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr had two advantages in achieving his new role: his long personal friendship with Muhammad and his role as a father-in-law. As caliph, Abu Bakr was the first to set guidelines for the new position of authority.\n\nFirst Fitna\nIn 656, Uthman's house was put under siege by about 1000 rebels. Eventually the rebels broke into the house and murdered Uthman, provoking the First Fitna. After killing Uthman, the rebels asked Ali to be the new caliph, although Ali was not involved in the murder of Uthman according to many reports. Ali reportedly initially refused the caliphate, agreeing to rule only after his followers persisted.\n\nContributions to Islam and Influence\nAfter 25 years of a monogamous relationship with his first wife, Khadija bint Khuwaylid, Muhammad participated in nine years of polygyny, marrying at least nine further wives. Muhammad's subsequent marriages were depicted purely as political matches rather than unions of sexual indulgence. In particular, Muhammad's unions with Aisha and Hafsa bint Umar associated him with two of the most significant leaders of the early Muslim community, Aisha's father, Abu Bakr, and Hafsa's father, ‘Umar ibn al-Khattāb.\n\nPolitical Influence\nAisha's political influence helped promote her father, Abu Bakr, to the caliphate after Muhammad's death. During the First Fitna, Aisha was a key figure in the opposition to Ali and his followers, and her actions helped to contribute to the eventual rise of Mu'awiya as the caliph of the Umayyad dynasty.\n\nDeath\nAisha died at her home in Medina on 17 Ramadan 58 AH (16 July 678). She was 67 years old. Abu Hurayra led her funeral prayer after the tahajjud (night) prayer, and she was buried at al-Baqi cemetery.\n\nSee Also\n* List of wives of Muhammad\n* Aisha in the Hadith\n* Aisha in art and literature\n\nReferences\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Aisha\" following this outline:\n\n\nSources\n\n\nEarly life\nAisha was born in Mecca c. 613–614 [20] [21] She was the daughter of Abu Bakr and Umm Ruman, two of Muhammad's most trusted companions [8] No sources offer much more information about Aisha's childhood years [22] [23]\n\n\nMarriage to Muhammad\nMuhammad said that he had twice seen Aisha in his dreams, being carried in a silk cloth by an angel who told him that she would be his wife Muhammad believed that if the dreams were from God, he would make them come true [24] [25] Following the death of his first wife, Khadija bint Khuwaylid, his aunt Khawlah bint Hakim suggested that he marry Aisha [26] [27] Aisha's father Abu Bakr was at first unsure about marrying his daughter to Muhammad;

It was founded in 1872 as a liberal arts college for men and has a rich history of academic excellence and community service.\n\n**History**\n\nThe college was chartered in 1872 as a liberal arts college for men, with the goal of providing a high-quality education to young men from the surrounding community. The college enrolled its first students in 1878 at Warren Street, in Jersey City, on the present site of its former high school section, St Peter's Preparatory School. For over 40 years, the college operated with a strong commitment to its mission and values, producing generations of graduates who went on to make significant contributions in various fields.\n\nHowever, in September 1918, the college was closed, along with several other Jesuit colleges and high schools, due to declining enrollment in the face of World War I and the concentration of Jesuit personnel at other colleges on the East Coast. The war ended only two months after its closing, and despite clamoring from alumni, it took until 1930 to re-open the college. During its temporary closure, the college was relocated to Newark Avenue, before moving in 1936 to its current location on Hudson (now Kennedy) Boulevard, between Montgomery Street and Glenwood Avenue.\n\nFor over 50 years, the college operated at its current location, providing a high-quality education to students from the surrounding community. In 2000, Gannon Hall, the science building, completed an $8.2 million renovation, which modernized the facility and provided state-of-the-art equipment and resources for students.\n\n**Academics**\n\nSaint Peter's University offers a wide range of undergraduate and graduate programs, including the following schools and colleges:\n\n* College of Arts and Sciences\n* School of Business\n* School of Education\n* School of Nursing\n* School of Professional and Continuing Studies\n\nThe university's academic programs are designed to provide students with a well-rounded education, combining theoretical knowledge with practical skills and real-world applications. The university's faculty is composed of experienced and dedicated professionals who are committed to providing students with a high-quality educational experience.\n\n**Undergraduate Admissions**\n\nThe university's undergraduate admissions process is highly selective, with a strong emphasis on academic achievement and potential for success. The admissions committee considers a range of factors, including:\n\n* High school GPA: The university views a student's high school GPA as a very important factor in the admissions process.\n* High school class rank: As available, the university considers a student's high school class rank as an important factor in the admissions process.\n* Letters of recommendation: The university requires letters of recommendation from teachers or counselors who can speak to a student's academic and personal qualities.\n* SAT or ACT scores: The university requires students to submit either SAT or ACT scores, or to submit a test-optional essay.\n\nFor the class of 2023, the middle 50% of admitted students had SAT scores between 960 and 1150, and ACT scores between 17 and 28. The average admitted student had a high school GPA of 3.31, and all admitted students were required to have completed college preparatory high school coursework.\n\n**Rankings**\n\nIn 2023, U.S News & World Report ranked Saint Peter's University tied for #58 out of 181 Regional Universities North, #6 in Best Value Schools, and #11 in Top Performers on Social Mobility. These rankings reflect the university's commitment to academic excellence, community service, and social mobility.\n\n**Athletics**\n\nThe university's athletic teams, known as the Peacocks, compete in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC). The university fields 16 athletic teams, including men's and women's teams in basketball, soccer, volleyball, and track and field.

The baseball, softball, and soccer teams play at Joseph J Jaroschak Field, in Lincoln Park, while all other teams play at the Victor R Yanitelli, S.J Recreational Life Center, located on campus. The university also uses the Jersey City Armory for some events.\n\n**Peacock Mascot**\n\nSaint Peter's University is the only NCAA Division I institution whose mascot is the peacock. This choice was made for several reasons. Primarily, the land on which Saint Peter's now stands was once owned by a man named Michiel Reyniersz Pauw, whose last name means \"peacock\" in Dutch.

Djokovic sought an injunction to prevent his deportation. The Federal Circuit and Family Court ruled in favour of Djokovic, ordered his release from detention and directed the federal government to pay his legal expenses. On 14 January, Minister for Immigration Alex Hawke used his discretionary power under sections 133C(3) and 116(1)(e)(i) of the Migration Act 1958 to cancel Djokovic's visa on health and good order grounds. Djokovic sought a judicial review against deportation, but three Federal Court of Australia judges unanimously rejected the review on 16 January, preventing him from defending his title.\n\n**Other

Developed in the 1980s, the system has undergone significant upgrades and improvements over the years, with the latest variant, the A5, entering service in the 21st century.\n\n**Development**\n\nDevelopment on the missile began in the early 1980s after an evaluation of missile and gun options to increase air defence capabilities showed that a high-velocity missile system would best meet the needs and could also replace existing shoulder-launched missiles. A General Staff Requirement (GSR 3979) was drawn up with the requirements of the system, specifying the requirement of three launch platforms for the missile.\n\nThe development process involved the collaboration of several British companies, including Short Brothers (now part of BAE Systems), Marconi Electronic Systems (now part of BAE Systems), and Thorn EMI. The missile was designed to be highly effective against a wide range of airborne targets, including fighter jets and helicopters.\n\n**Description**\n\nWhen used in the light or MANPADS (Man-Portable Air Defence System) role, the Starstreak missile is transported in a sealed launch tube. This tube is attached to an aiming unit for firing. The operator tracks the target using the aiming unit's optically stabilized sight. The process of tracking the target allows the aiming unit to compute the right trajectory to bring the missile together with the target. The operator can indicate wind direction to the unit and, in the case of a long-range target, provide superelevation.\n\nWhen the initial tracking is complete, the operator fires the missile by pressing a button. The missile then engages the target using its guidance system, which is designed to intercept and destroy the target with a high-velocity kinetic warhead.\n\n**Advantages**\n\nThe Starstreak missile has a number of advantages over infrared homing guided, radar homing guided, and radio command guidance MCLOS/SACLOS (e.g. Blowpipe or Javelin) missiles. Its high-velocity kinetic warhead allows it to engage targets with a high degree of accuracy and effectiveness, making it a highly effective air defence system.\n\nIn addition, the Starstreak missile has a number of other advantages, including:\n\n* High-speed performance: The Starstreak missile has a speed of over Mach 3, making it one of the fastest air defence missiles in the world.\n* Long-range performance: The Starstreak missile has a range of over 10 kilometers, making it capable of engaging targets at long range.\n* High accuracy: The Starstreak missile has a high degree of accuracy, with a circular error probable (CEP) of less than 1 meter.\n* Low signature: The Starstreak missile has a low radar cross-section, making it difficult to detect and track.\n\n**Service history**\n\nThe missile was brought into service with 12th Regiment Royal Artillery and 47th Regiment Royal Artillery in 1997 as part of the High Velocity Missile (HVM) system equipped with both the Air Defence Acquisition Device (ADAD) and a ×60 thermal sight. Each regiment was equipped with 108 HVM self-propelled armoured launchers mounted on the Stormer tracked chassis capable of holding eight missiles ready to fire and a further eight reloads.\n\nThe launchers could originally run on batteries for extended periods to minimise their signature, but significant upgrades dramatically increased the system's power requirements. A light-role variant known as HVM Lightweight Multi Launch (LML), capable of holding three ready-to-fire missiles, was also brought into service with the Air Defence Troop Royal Marines and a Royal Artillery Air Assault Battery attached to 16 Air Assault Brigade.\n\nThe systems' armoured variant, the HVM Self Propelled (Stormer), saw service during the Second Gulf War but did not fire. The British Army currently uses the A5 fifth-generation missile, significantly improved from the original missile. The HVM SP and LML variants now carry a mix of both Starstreak A5 and Lightweight Multirole Missiles.\n\n**Variants**\n\nThe Starstreak missile system has undergone several upgrades and improvements over the years, resulting in several variants:\n\n* Starstreak A1: The original variant, introduced in the 1990s.\n* Starstreak A2: An upgraded variant, introduced in the early 2000s.\n* Starstreak A5: The latest variant, introduced in the 21st century. This variant has a number of improvements, including a more powerful propulsion system and a more advanced guidance system.\n* Lightweight Multirole Missile (LMM): A variant of the Starstreak missile designed for use in the light-role, with a smaller size and weight than the A5 variant.\n\n**Operators**\n\nThe Starstreak missile system has been operated by several countries, including:\n\n* United Kingdom: The British Army has been the primary operator of the Starstreak missile system since its introduction in the 1990s.\n* Saudi Arabia: The Saudi Arabian military has purchased the Starstreak missile system for use in their air defence forces.\n* Oman: The Omani military has also purchased the Starstreak missile system.\n\n**See also**\n\n* High Velocity Missile (HVM)\n* Lightweight Multirole Missile (LMM)\n* Surface-to-air missile\n* Air defence\n\n**References**\n\nnone\n\n**External links**\n\n* BAE Systems - Starstreak Air Defence Missile\n* Ministry of Defence - Starstreak Air Defence Missile", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Starstreak\" following this outline:\n\n\nDevelopment\nDevelopment on the missile began in the early 1980s after an evaluation of missile and gun options to increase air defence capabilities showed that a high-velocity missile system would best meet the needs and could also replace existing shoulder-launched missiles A General Staff Requirement (GSR 3979) [6] was drawn up with the requirements of the system, specifying the requirement of three launch platforms for the missile:\n\n\nDescription\nWhen used in the light or MANPADS role, the Starstreak missile is transported in a sealed launch tube This tube is attached to an aiming unit for firing The operator tracks the target using the aiming unit's optically stabilized sight The process of tracking the target allows the aiming unit to compute the right trajectory to bring the missile together with the target The operator can indicate wind direction to the unit and, in the case of a long-range target, provide superelevation When the initial tracking is complete, the operator fires the missile by pressing a button [6]\n\n\nAdvantages\nStarstreak has a number of advantages over infrared homing guided, radar homing guided, and radio command guidance MCLOS/SACLOS (e.g Blowpipe or Javelin) missiles:\n\n\nService history\nThe missile was brought into service with 12th Regiment Royal Artillery and 47th Regiment Royal Artillery in 1997 as part of the High Velocity Missile (HVM) system equipped with both the Air Defence Acquisition Device (ADAD) and a ×60 thermal sight Each regiment was equipped with 108 HVM self-propelled armoured launchers mounted on the Stormer tracked chassis capable of holding eight missiles ready to fire and a further eight reloads (the original capacity of twelve was reduced during a revision) The launchers could originally run on batteries for extended periods to minimise their signature, but significant upgrades dramatically increased the system's power requirements A light-role variant known as HVM Lightweight Multi Launch (LML), capable of holding three ready-to-fire missiles, was also brought into service with the Air Defence Troop Royal Marines and a Royal Artillery Air Assault Battery attached to 16 Air Assault Brigade The systems' armoured variant, the HVM Self Propelled (Stormer), saw service during the Second Gulf War but did not fire The British Army currently uses the A5 fifth-generation missile, significantly improved from the original missile The HVM SP and LML variants now carry a mix of both Starstreak A5 and Lightweight Multirole Missiles.\n\n\nVariants\n\n\nOperators\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film stars Song Joong-ki, Kim Tae-ri, Jin Seon-kyu, and Yoo Hae-jin. It was released on Netflix on February 5, 2021.\n\n**Plot Summary**\n\nThe film takes place in the year 2092, where Earth has become uninhabitable due to environmental disasters and overpopulation. A private corporation called UTS has created an orbiting space station and artificial planetoids for a select group of humans, who live in idyllic conditions. By contrast, 90% of humanity lives in poverty and squalor on a dying Earth.\n\nThe story follows Tae-ho, the captain of a group of space sweepers who operate in a derelict spaceship called Victory. Tae-ho, along with his crew, including a skilled pilot named Tiger Park and an android named Bubs, scavenge for valuable technology and resources from abandoned spaceships.\n\nHowever, their lives take a dramatic turn when they stumble upon a young girl named Cat, who is a fugitive from the corporation. Cat has the ability to interface directly with technology, making her a valuable asset to the corporation. As they try to protect Cat from being captured by the corporation, the crew of Victory finds themselves caught in a desperate battle for survival.\n\n**Themes**\n\nThe film explores several themes, including the consequences of unchecked technological advancement and the exploitation of the poor by the wealthy. The corporation's actions are depicted as a form of colonialism, where they exploit the resources of a dying planet and leave the majority of humanity to suffer.\n\nThe film also touches on the theme of identity and what it means to be human. Bubs, the android, struggles with his own identity and the limitations placed on him by his creators. This serves as a commentary on the treatment of artificial intelligence and the ethics of creating beings that are capable of thinking and feeling.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a diverse cast, including Song Joong-ki, Kim Tae-ri, Jin Seon-kyu, and Yoo Hae-jin. Song Joong-ki plays the role of Tae-ho, the captain of the Victory crew. Kim Tae-ri plays the role of Tiger Park, a skilled pilot and member of the crew. Jin Seon-kyu plays the role of Bubs, an android who joins the crew. Yoo Hae-jin provides the voice and motion capture for Bubs.\n\n**Production**\n\nPrincipal photography for the film began on July 3, 2019, and wrapped up on November 2, 2019. The film was shot using a combination of practical and visual effects. The film's visual effects were handled by the Korean company, Digital Garden.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe film was initially set to be released in 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the release was postponed. The film was eventually released on Netflix on February 5, 2021.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 69% approval rating, based on 26 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The site's consensus reads, \"As a story, Space Sweepers isn't as adventurous as its star-navigating protagonists -- but relatable characters and impressive effects keep it from drifting out of orbit.\"\n\nOn Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 4 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\n**Audience Viewership**\n\nThe film was a major success on Netflix, debuting at number one in 16 countries, including France, Malaysia, Croatia, South Korea, and the Philippines. The film also dominated Netflix's daily top 10 rankings in 80 countries upon its premiere. The film gathered over 26 million household viewers on Netflix during the first 28 days of its release, or 53,340,000 hours watched.\n\n**Critical Response**\n\nThe film's visual effects were praised by critics, with many noting that they were impressive and well-executed. The film's action sequences were also praised, with many noting that they were intense and well-choreographed.\n\nHowever, some critics noted that the film's story was predictable and that the characters were underdeveloped. Others noted that the film's themes were not fully explored and that the film's message was not fully conveyed.\n\n**Adaptations**\n\nA webtoon based on the film premiered on May 26, 2020, on Daum and KakaoPage. It premiered globally on February 8, 2021.\n\n**Awards and Nominations**\n\nThe film has not received any major awards or nominations.

ambassador to Japan and reading pamphlets sent by the Swedes, developed, in his words, \"a fairly good idea of what the Olympic Games were.\" [52]\n\n\nHepburn romanization\nKanō was a member of the Rōmaji Hirome-kai (ローマ字ひろめ会, Society for the Spread of Romanization), one of the two groups that emerged after the Russo-Japanese War from the Rōmaji-kai (羅馬字会, Romanization Club), a group that sought to replace written Japanese with a romanized script instead of kanji and kana The Rōmaji Hirome-kai supported Hepburn romanization, while the other group, the Nihon no Rōmaji-sha (日本のローマ字社, Romanization Society of Japan), supported Nihon-shiki romanization [56] In 1908, Hepburn romanization was revised by Kanō and others of the Rōmaji Hirome-kai, which began calling it the Shūsei Hebon-shiki (修正ヘボン式, \"modified Hepburn system\") or Hyōjun-shiki (標準式, \"standard system\") [57]\n\n\nDeath and legacy\nIn 1934, Kanō stopped giving public exhibitions The reason was his failing health, probably compounded by kidney stones The British judoka Sarah Mayer  wrote \"People don’t seem to think he will live much longer\" to his friends in London [58] Nevertheless, Kanō continued attending important Kodokan events such as kagami-biraki (New Years' ceremonies) whenever he could, and he continued participating in Olympics business.\n\n\nHonors\n\n\nPublished works\n\n\nIn

He is the eldest child of Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh, and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh.\n\nInfancy\n\nJames was born on 17 December 2007 at 16:20 GMT at Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey by caesarean section. His father, Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh, is the youngest child of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. His mother, Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh, worked in public relations before joining the royal family through her marriage in 1999. His full name, James Alexander Philip Theo, was announced on 21 December.\n\nThe birth of James was seen as a significant event in the royal family, as it marked the first time a member of the royal family had been born with a Welsh surname, reflecting the Welsh ancestry of Sophie's family. The couple's decision to use the surname Mountbatten-Windsor was also seen as a nod to James's heritage.\n\nEducation\n\nJames attended Eagle House School, a coeducational preparatory school near Sandhurst, Berkshire from 2011 to 2021. He was a member of the school's rugby team and was known for his sporting prowess. In 2021, he moved to the private Radley College in Oxfordshire, where he continues his education.\n\nJames's education has been a subject of interest among the media, with many speculating about his future career choices. While there is no indication of what James plans to do after completing his education, it is likely that he will follow in his father's footsteps and pursue a career in the military or public service.\n\nOfficial Appearances\n\nJames made his first official appearance in the carriage procession at Trooping the Colour in 2016. He was accompanied by his parents and other members of the royal family as they made their way through the streets of London. The event marked a significant milestone in James's young life, as it was his first major public appearance.\n\nJames has since appeared at several other official events, including the 2022 Trooping the Colour. He has also accompanied his parents on visits to various parts of the country, including Scotland and Wales.\n\nTitles, Styles, and Honours\n\nThe title Viscount Severn alludes to the Welsh ancestry of Sophie's family. James was accorded this courtesy title at birth, as heir apparent to his father's earldom. The title is a nod to James's heritage and reflects the importance of his family's Welsh roots.\n\nJames's title has been the subject of some speculation among the media, with some questioning the need for a courtesy title in the modern era. However, the title remains an important part of James's identity and reflects the traditions of the British royal family.\n\nHonours and Decorations\n\nIn June 2008, a lake in the Canadian province of Manitoba was named Lake James in recognition of Prince Edward's visit to the province. The lake is located in the north of the province and is a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts.\n\nJames's sister was similarly honoured by the naming of Lake Louise in the same province. The lake is a popular destination for tourists and is known for its natural beauty.\n\nConclusion\n\nJames, Viscount Severn, is a member of the British royal family and the eldest child of Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh, and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh. He was born on 17 December 2007 and has since made several official appearances alongside his parents. James's education and future career choices remain the subject of speculation among the media, but one thing is certain – he will continue to play an important role in the British royal family for years to come.\n\nSee also\n\n* Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh\n* Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh\n* British royal family\n* Wales\n* Canada", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"James,_Viscount_Severn\" following this outline:\n\n\nInfancy\nJames was born on 17 December 2007 at 16:20 GMT at Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey by caesarean section [1] [2] His father Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh, is the youngest child of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh His mother Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh, worked in public relations before joining the royal family through her marriage in 1999 His full name, James Alexander Philip Theo, was announced on 21 December [3]\n\n\nEducation\nJames attended Eagle House School, a coeducational preparatory school near Sandhurst, Berkshire from 2011 to 2021, before joining the private Radley College in Oxfordshire [7]\n\n\nOfficial appearances\nJames made his first official appearance in the carriage procession at Trooping the Colour in 2016 [8] and also appeared at the 2022 Trooping the Colour [9]\n\n\nTitles, styles, and honours\nThe title Viscount Severn alludes to the Welsh ancestry of Sophie's family [19] James was accorded this courtesy title at birth, as heir apparent to his father's earldom [20]\n\n\nTitles and styles\nThe title Viscount Severn alludes to the Welsh ancestry of Sophie's family [19] James was accorded this courtesy title at birth, as heir apparent to his father's earldom [20]\n\n\nHonours and decorations\nIn June 2008, to recognise Prince Edward's visit to the Canadian province of Manitoba, a lake in the north of the province was called Lake James James's sister was similarly honoured by Lake Louise in the same province [29]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The accident involved the exposure of several people to high levels of radiation from a radioactive source, resulting in serious health effects and eventually leading to the deaths of several individuals.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe 1962 Mexico City radiation accident was one of the most significant nuclear accidents of the 20th century, highlighting the risks and consequences of nuclear exposure. The accident occurred when a team of scientists and technicians were handling a radioactive source, a cobalt-60 radioactive isotope, at the Nuclear Research Center in Mexico City. The incident was not immediately reported, and it was only after several people began to exhibit symptoms of radiation sickness that the accident was revealed to the public. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the accident, its causes, and its consequences.\n\n**Background**\n\nIn the early 1960s, Mexico was one of the few countries in Latin America with a nuclear research program. The Nuclear Research Center in Mexico City was established in 1959 to conduct research and development in nuclear science and technology. The center was equipped with a number of nuclear reactors and facilities, including a radioactive isotope production facility. The facility produced a range of radioactive isotopes, including cobalt-60, which was used for medical and industrial applications.\n\n**The Accident**\n\nOn September 16, 1962, a team of scientists and technicians were handling a cobalt-60 source at the Nuclear Research Center. The source, which was in the form of a small cylinder, was being transported to a storage facility when it was dropped and damaged. The team quickly realized that the source was leaking radioactive material and that several people had been exposed to high levels of radiation.\n\n**Exposure and Health Effects**\n\nSeveral people were exposed to high levels of radiation during the accident, including the team of scientists and technicians who were handling the cobalt-60 source. The exposure levels ranged from moderate to severe, and several individuals exhibited symptoms of radiation sickness, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. In the days and weeks following the accident, several people were hospitalized with radiation sickness, and some eventually died from their injuries.\n\n**Causes of the Accident**\n\nThe 1962 Mexico City radiation accident was caused by a combination of human error and inadequate safety procedures. The team handling the cobalt-60 source had not followed proper safety protocols, and the facility did not have adequate radiation detection and monitoring systems in place. The accident highlighted the importance of strict safety procedures and the need for adequate radiation detection and monitoring systems in nuclear facilities.\n\n**Consequences**\n\nThe 1962 Mexico City radiation accident had significant consequences for the people involved and for the nuclear research program in Mexico. Several individuals died from their injuries, and many others were left with long-term health effects. The accident led to a major overhaul of the nuclear research program in Mexico, with a renewed focus on safety and radiation protection. The incident also highlighted the need for international cooperation and safety standards in the nuclear industry.\n\n**Cleanup and Remediation**\n\nThe cleanup and remediation efforts following the accident were extensive and took several months to complete. The facility was evacuated, and a team of experts was brought in to clean up the radioactive material and restore the facility to safe condition. The cleanup efforts were successful, and the facility was eventually reopened.\n\n**Investigation and Lessons Learned**\n\nAn investigation into the accident was conducted, and a number of lessons were learned. The investigation highlighted the importance of strict safety procedures and the need for adequate radiation detection and monitoring systems in nuclear facilities. The incident also highlighted the need for international cooperation and safety standards in the nuclear industry.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Nuclear safety\n* Radiation protection\n* Nuclear accidents\n* Cobalt-60\n* Nuclear research\n* Mexico City", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"1962_Mexico_City_radiation_accident\" following this outline:\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

(1899–1931)\nThe Frankford Athletic Association was organized in May 1899 in the parlor of the Suburban Club The cost of purchasing a share in the association was $10 However, there were also contributing memberships, ranging from $1 to $2.50, made available to the general public The Association was a community-based non-profit organization of local residents and businesses In keeping with

Yellow Jackets tradition, they carried the \"Frankford\" name again in 1912, to become the Frankford Athletic Association.\n\n\nBell and Wray era (1933–1940)\nAfter more than a year of searching for a suitable replacement for the Yellow Jackets in the lucrative Philadelphia market, the National Football League granted an expansion franchise to an ownership group headed by Bert Bell and Lud Wray, who were also awarded the liquidated assets of the defunct Yellow Jackets organization The Bell–Wray group had to pay an entry fee of $3,500, or roughly US$67,000 in inflation-adjusted 2022 dollars, and assumed a total debt of $11,000 the Yellow Jackets owed to three other NFL franchises [15] Drawing inspiration from the Blue Eagle logo of the National Recovery Administration, a centerpiece of President Franklin D Roosevelt's New Deal policies, [15] Bell and Wray named their new franchise the Philadelphia Eagles While it could seem as if the Yellow Jackets simply rebranded as the Eagles, both the Eagles organization and NFL officially regard the teams as two separate entities Not only was there no Philadelphia NFL team for a season and a half, but almost no players from the 1931 Yellow Jackets appeared on the Eagles' first roster.\n\n\nThompson, Wolman and the Happy Hundred era (1941–1969)\nIn December 1940, Bell intervened to stop the sale of Art Rooney's Steelers to Alexis Thompson, [25] and Rooney then acquired half of Bell's interest in the Eagles [26] In a series of events known as the Pennsylvania Polka, [25] Rooney and Bell exchanged their entire Eagles roster and their territorial rights in Philadelphia to Thompson for his entire Steelers roster and his rights in Pittsburgh [27] Rooney provided assistance to Bell by rewarding him with a 20% commission on the sale of the Steelers [28] Bell became the Steelers' head coach and Rooney became the Steelers' general manager [29]\n\n\nGreasy Neale years (1941–1950)\nAfter assuming ownership, Thompson promptly hired Greasy Neale as the team's head coach During the first years under Neale, the Eagles' struggles continued, and they finished the 1941 season with a 2–8–1 record [30] In the 1942 season, there was no improvement as the team finished the season 2–9 [31]\n\n\nSteagles (1943)\nIn 1943, with player shortages stemming from the U.S entry engagement in World War II, it became difficult to fill the roster, and the team merged with the Steelers to form the \"Phil-Pitt Eagles\", known as the Steagles [32] Greasy Neale continued to coach the team along with Steelers head coach Walt Kiesling The team finished the 1943 season with a 5–4–1 record, and the merger, which was never intended to be a permanent arrangement, was dissolved at the season's end [33]\n\n\nNFL champions (1948)\nUndeterred, the young team rebounded in 1948 to return to the NFL Championship game With home field advantage and a blinding snowstorm on their side, the Eagles won their first NFL Championship against the Chicago Cardinals by a score of 7–0 [36] The only score came in the fourth quarter when Steve Van Buren ran for a five-yard touchdown [37] Because of the severe weather, few fans witnessed the joyous occasion.\n\n\nNFL champions (1949)\nIn 1949, the Eagles returned to the NFL Championship game for a third consecutive year The Eagles were favored by a touchdown, [39] [40] [41] and won 14–0 for their second consecutive title game shutout Running back Steve Van Buren rushed for 196 yards on 31 carries for the Eagles, and their defense held the Rams to just 21 yards on the ground [42] Chuck Bednarik was selected as the first overall pick in the 1949 NFL draft An All-American lineman/linebacker from the University of Pennsylvania, Bednarik would go on to become one of the greatest and most beloved players in Eagles history.\n\n\nBuck Shaw years (1958–1960)\nIn 1958, the Eagles took several steps to improve, hiring Buck Shaw as head coach and acquiring quarterback Norm Van Brocklin in a trade with the Los Angeles Rams During the 1959 season, the team showed flashes of talent, and finished in second place in the Eastern Division Former Eagles owner and co-founder Bert Bell had become NFL commissioner, and attended the Eagles game on October 11 at Franklin Field against the Pittsburgh Steelers, a team Bell used to own Bell refused the box seats that the Eagles reserved for him and purchased his own tickets to sit with the fans During the fourth quarter, while sitting behind the end zone, Bell suffered a heart attack and died later that day.\n\n\nNFL champions (1960)\nThe Eagles' 1960 season remains one of the most celebrated year in team history Shaw, Van Brocklin, and Bednarik, each in their last season before retirement, led an Eagles team more notable for its grit than its talent One observer later quipped that the team had \"nothing but a championship\" to its first division title since 1949 The team was aided by their two Pro Bowl receivers, wide receiver Tommy McDonald, who later wrote an autobiography titled They Pay Me to Catch Footballs, and tight end Pete Retzlaff.\n\n\nLeonard Tose era (1969–1984)\nIn 1969, Leonard Tose bought the team from Wolman for $16.155 million, [49] the equivalent of $134 million today, representing a record then for the highest amount ever paid for a professional sports franchise Tose's first official act was to fire Coach Joe Kuharich after a disappointing 24–41–1 record during his five-year reign Tose then named former Eagles wide receiver Pete Retzlaff the team's general manager and Jerry Williams as its new head coach.\n\n\nDick Vermeil years (1976–1982)\nIn 1976, Dick Vermeil was hired from UCLA to coach the struggling Eagles, who had managed only one winning season from 1962 to 1975 [54] Vermeil faced numerous obstacles as he attempted to rejuvenate a franchise that had not seriously contended in well over a decade Despite the team's young talent and Gabriel's occasional flashes of brilliance, the Eagles finished 1976 with the same 4–10 record as in 1975 In 1977, the first seeds of hope began to emerge The team obtained hard-throwing quarterback Ron Jaworski in a trade from the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for popular tight end Charle Young The defense, led by Bergey and defensive coordinator Marion Campbell, began earning a reputation as one of the hardest-hitting in the league.\n\n\nNorman Braman era (1985–1993)\nIn 1985, Tose was forced to sell the Eagles to Norman Braman and Ed Leibowitz, highly successful automobile dealers from Florida, for a reported $65 million (equal to $184 million today) to pay off his more than $25 million ($71 million today) in gambling debts at Atlantic City casinos [60] The team again struggled during the 1985 season, and Campbell was fired after week 16, to be replaced by assistant head coach/defensive backs coach Fred Bruney for the season's last game [61]\n\n\nBuddy Ryan years (1986–1990)\nIn 1986, the arrival of head coach Buddy Ryan and his fiery attitude sparked team performance and ignited the fan base Immediately infusing the team with his hard-as-nails attitude, the Eagles quickly became known for their tough defense and tougher attitudes [63] Ryan began rejuvenating the team by releasing several aging players, including Ron Jaworski Randall Cunningham took his place and, despite a 5–10–1 season, began showing considerable promise 1987 saw another strike, which shortened the season by one game [64] The substitutes who had filled in for the strikers performed poorly and were crushed 41–22 by the Dallas Cowboys After the strike, the regular Eagles' 1987 team won a 37–20 revenge game against Dallas The season record was 7–8, of which three games had been played by substitutes.\n\n\nJeffrey Lurie era (1994–present)\nBy 1994, team owner Norman Braman had become largely unpopular among local fans and a polarizing presence in the front office Jeffrey Lurie bought the Eagles on May 6, 1994, for an estimated $185 million [71] The club is now estimated to be the 21st most valuable sports team, worth $3.4 billion, as evaluated in 2021 by Forbes [72]\n\n\nAndy Reid years (1999–2012)\nThe Eagles reemerged as a predominant NFL team under the leadership of new head coach Andy Reid, who was hired away from the Green Bay Packers, where he was the Packers' quarterback coach Reid's first notable step was drafting Syracuse quarterback Donovan McNabb with the second overall pick in the 1999 NFL draft [86] The Eagles' awful 1998 season would have entitled the Eagle to first pick but it was awarded to the rebooted Cleveland Browns Despite clearing the roster for new talent by releasing unpopular and aging veterans such as Ricky Watters and Irving Fryar, Reid was still a virtual unknown before his arrival as head coach, and his appointment was met initially with skepticism among Philadelphia fans The drafting of McNabb was unpopular with many Eagles fans, many of whom traveled to Madison Square Garden for the 1999 Draft and booed the selection, believing the Eagles instead should have selected Ricky Williams, a University of Texas running back who had been named the 1998 AP College Player of the Year.\n\n\nChip Kelly years (2013–2015)\nOn January 16, 2013, after a 4–12 season, the Eagles brought in University of Oregon head coach Chip Kelly to succeed Reid as head coach [111] The Philadelphia Eagles named Michael Vick the starting quarterback going into the 2013 season with much promise running Chip Kelly's fast-paced spread offense [112] The 2013 season proved very successful for the Eagles While a hamstring injury took Michael Vick out after a 1–3 start, his backup Nick Foles led the team to a 10–6 regular-season record and its seventh NFC East title in 13 seasons, but the Eagles lost to the New Orleans Saints in the wild card round Before throwing his first interception in Week 14, Foles had thrown 19 touchdowns, just one shy of the all-time NFL record of consecutive touchdowns without an interception to start a season, set earlier in the season by Peyton Manning Foles also tied Manning for most touchdown passes in a single game, with seven, against the Oakland Raiders, which also made him the youngest player in NFL history to throw for that many touchdowns in a game Foles finished the regular season with 27 touchdown passes and only 2 interceptions, giving him the then-best TD-INT ratio in NFL history (That record was later broken by Tom Brady, in the 2016 season.) He also finished with a 119.0 passer rating, third-highest in league history behind only Aaron Rodgers in 2011 and Peyton Manning in 2004 He was also only the second quarterback in NFL history to have a game in which he topped 400 passing yards and a perfect passer rating LeSean McCoy finished his Pro Bowl season as the league's top rusher with 1,607 rushing yards (also a franchise record) and 2,146 total yards from scrimmage, also best in the NFL As a whole, the Eagles offense scored 51 touchdowns, most in franchise history, passing the previous season-high set back in 1948 Following the 2013 season, the Eagles released Pro-Bowl wide receiver DeSean Jackson due to his poor \"work ethic and attitude\", as well as speculation of his involvement in gang-related activities [113] The team signed All Pro safety Malcolm Jenkins to a three-year contract, worth $16.25 million [114]\n\n\nDoug Pederson years (2016–2020)\nThe Eagles hired Kansas City Chiefs' offensive coordinator Doug Pederson as their next head coach on January 18, 2016 [126] Pederson had been with the Chiefs for the preceding three years after having spent the four seasons before those with the Eagles He served as a quality control assistant coach for the Eagles in 2009 and 2010 before being promoted to quarterbacks coach for the 2011 and 2012 seasons He had been praised for his work with Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith over the prior several seasons, particularly 2015, as the Chiefs moved into the top 10 in scoring offense [127] [128]\n\n\nSuper Bowl LII champions (2017)\nThe Eagles had a 13–3 record in 2017, including a nine-game winning streak [138] In a week 14 game against the Los Angeles Rams, starting quarterback Carson Wentz left the game with a torn anterior cruciate ligament, and backup Nick Foles, who had been re-signed in the off-season, took over for the rest of the season [139] Wentz was considered to have been playing at an MVP level at the time of his injury [140] [141] Foles's first start was a comeback from a 20–7 deficit against the New York Giants where he scored four touchdowns to win 34–29 [142] Foles struggled in the last two games of the season against the Oakland Raiders and the Dallas Cowboys and threw a touchdown and two interceptions in those two games [143] Despite this, the Eagles clinched home-field advantage after the win against Oakland in week 16 Foles led the Eagles past the Atlanta Falcons in the Divisional Round 15–10 [144] In the NFC Championship game, the Eagles beat the Minnesota Vikings 38–7, despite having been betting underdogs [145] Foles had his best game since week 15 and threw for 352 passing yards and three touchdowns [146] The Eagles traveled to Minneapolis to compete in Super Bowl LII, their third attempt at a title, against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots in a rematch of Super Bowl XXXIX from 2005 [147]\n\n\nNick Sirianni years (2021–present)\nThe Eagles hired former Indianapolis Colts' offensive coordinator Nick Sirianni as their next head coach on January 21, 2021 [188] During the offseason, the Eagles traded starting quarterback Carson Wentz to the Colts for a 2021 third-round draft pick and a 2022 conditional second-round pick [189] In doing so, Wentz was reunited with Frank Reich, head coach of the Colts who served as the Eagles' offensive coordinator for Wentz's first two years in Philadelphia, including during their Super Bowl-winning season in 2017 The Eagles absorbed a $33.8-million dead-cap hit for trading Wentz [190]\n\n\nChampionships\nThe Eagles were a part of the NFL Eastern Division from 1933 to 1949, the National Conference from 1950 to 1953, and the Eastern Conference from 1953 to 1966 They were then placed in the Capitol Division of the Eastern Conference in 1967 When the league reformed into the NFC and AFC in 1970, the Eagles were placed in the NFC East.\n\n\nNFL championships (pre-Super Bowl era)\nThe Eagles were a part of the NFL Eastern Division from

1960 Dallas leads the all-time series 74–56 as of the 2023 season, but in recent years, the series has been close, with each team winning 12 games since 2006 [220] There is considerable hostility between the two teams' fan bases, with incidents such as the 1989 Bounty Bowl The rivalry has even spilled over into draft weekend, with Cowboys legend Drew Pearson and Eagles legend David Akers exchanging insults at the opposing franchise in 2017 and 2018, respectively [221] [222]\n\n\nDivisional\nThe Eagles and Dallas Cowboys rivalry has been listed among the best and most acrimonious in

when both teams came to relative prominence in the 1940s and 1950s The two teams have played in the same division in the NFL every year since 1933 The ferocity of the rivalry can also be attributed to the geographic New York-Philadelphia rivalry, which is mirrored in Major League Baseball's Mets–Phillies and the NHL's Flyers–Rangers and Flyers–Islanders It is ranked by NFL Network as one of the greatest rivalries of all time, [223] Sports Illustrated ranks it as the fourth best NFL rivalry of all time, [8] and according to ESPN, it is one of the fiercest and most well-known rivalries in the football community [224] As of the 2023 season, the Eagles lead the all-time series 94–89–2 [225]\n\n\nWashington Commanders\nWhile not as big as the rivalries with the Giants and Cowboys, the Eagles' historical rivalry with the Washington Redskins / Washington Football Team / Washington Commanders has still been fierce Although the two franchises played in the same division in the Eagles' inaugural 1933 season, their first meeting did not take place until October 21, 1934, during Washington's first year under the Boston Redskins moniker; the Redskins defeated the Eagles 6–0 at Fenway Park [226] Washington currently leads the all-time series 89–85–6 Since 2010, the rivalry has been very even overall with the Eagles winning 16 of the last 27 matchups [227]\n\n\nConference\nThe

both located in Pennsylvania and began play in 1933 [232] From that season through 1966, this was a major rivalry for both teams, as both were part of the same division In 1967 they were placed in separate divisions, but remained in the same conference for three years In 1970 the Steelers (along with the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Colts) moved to the American Football Conference, while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old-line NFL teams in the National Football Conference As a result, the Eagles and Steelers no longer played each other every year; instead, they are scheduled to meet once every four years in the regular season The most recent meeting was in 2022 at Lincoln Financial Field due to the addition of a regular season game based on opposing conference divisional finish from the season before, with the Eagles winning 35–13 The Steelers have lost ten straight games on the road against the Eagles dating back to 1966, which was also the start of the Super Bowl era As of the 2023 season, the Eagles lead the all-time series 49–29–3 [233]\n\n\nPittsburgh Steelers\nThe Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers are both located in Pennsylvania and began play in 1933 [232]

The team was founded in 1933 and is a member of the National Football League (NFL). They are part of the NFC East division and have a long history of competition with rival teams such as the Dallas Cowboys and New York Giants.\n\n## History\n\nThe Eagles were organized in May 1899 in the parlor of the Suburban Club. The cost of purchasing a share in the association was $10. However, there were also contributing memberships, ranging from $1 to $2.50, made available to the general public. The Association was a community-based non-profit organization of local residents and businesses. In keeping with its charter, which stated that \"all profits shall be donated to charity\", all of the team's excess income was donated to local charitable institutions.\n\nThe original Frankford Athletic Association apparently disbanded prior to the 1909 football season. Several of the original players from the 1899 football team kept the team together, and they became known as Loyola Athletic Club. In keeping with Yellow Jackets tradition, they carried the \"Frankford\" name again in 1912, to become the Frankford Athletic Association.\n\n## NFL in Philadelphia (1899-1931)\n\nThe Frankford Athletic Association was organized in May 1899 in the parlor of the Suburban Club. The cost of purchasing a share in the association was $10. However, there were also contributing memberships, ranging from $1 to $2.50, made available to the general public.

Several of the original players from the 1899 football team kept the team together, and they became known as Loyola Athletic Club. In keeping with Yellow Jackets tradition, they carried the \"Frankford\" name again in 1912, to become the Frankford Athletic Association.\n\n## Bell and Wray era (1933-1940)\n\nAfter more than a year of searching for a suitable replacement for the Yellow Jackets in the lucrative Philadelphia market, the National Football League granted an expansion franchise to an ownership group headed by Bert Bell and Lud Wray, who were also awarded the liquidated assets of the defunct Yellow Jackets organization. The Bell–Wray group had to pay an entry fee of $3,500, or roughly US$67,000 in inflation-adjusted 2022 dollars, and assumed a total debt of $11,000 the Yellow Jackets owed to three other NFL franchises.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the Blue Eagle logo of the National Recovery Administration, a centerpiece of President Franklin D Roosevelt's New Deal policies, Bell and Wray named their new franchise the Philadelphia Eagles. While it could seem as if the Yellow Jackets simply rebranded as the Eagles, both the Eagles organization and NFL officially regard the teams as two separate entities.\n\n## Thompson, Wolman and the Happy Hundred era (1941-1969)\n\nIn December 1940, Bell intervened to stop the sale of Art Rooney's Steelers to Alexis Thompson, and Rooney then acquired half of Bell's interest in the Eagles. In a series of events known as the Pennsylvania Polka, Rooney and Bell exchanged their entire Eagles roster and their territorial rights in Philadelphia to Thompson for his entire Steelers roster and his rights in Pittsburgh. Rooney provided assistance to Bell by rewarding him with a 20% commission on the sale of the Steelers. Bell became the Steelers' head coach and Rooney became the Steelers' general manager.\n\n## Greasy Neale years (1941-1950)\n\nAfter assuming ownership, Thompson promptly hired Greasy Neale as the team's head coach. During the first years under Neale, the Eagles' struggles continued, and they finished the 1941 season with a 2–8–1 record. In the 1942 season, there was no improvement as the team finished the season 2–9.\n\n## Steagles (1943)\n\nIn 1943, with player shortages stemming from the U.S. entry engagement in World War II, it became difficult to fill the roster, and the team merged with the Steelers to form the \"Phil-Pitt Eagles\", known as the Steagles. Greasy Neale continued to coach the team along with Steelers head coach Walt Kiesling. The team finished the 1943 season with a 5–4–1 record, and the merger, which was never intended to be a permanent arrangement, was dissolved at the season's end.\n\n## Super Bowl champions (1948)\n\nUndeterred, the young team rebounded in 1948 to return to the NFL Championship game. With home field advantage and a blinding snowstorm on their side, the Eagles won their first NFL Championship against the Chicago Cardinals by a score of 7–0. The only score came in the fourth quarter when Steve Van Buren ran for a five-yard touchdown.\n\n## Super Bowl champions (1949)\n\nIn 1949, the Eagles returned to the NFL Championship game for a second consecutive year. The Eagles were favored by a touchdown, and won 14–0 for their second consecutive title game shutout. Running back Steve Van Buren rushed for 196 yards on 31 carries for the Eagles, and their defense held the Rams to just 21 yards on the ground.\n\n## Buck Shaw years (1958-1960)\n\nIn 1958, the Eagles took several steps to improve, hiring Buck Shaw as head coach and acquiring quarterback Norm Van Brocklin in a trade with the Los Angeles Rams. During the 1959 season, the team showed flashes of talent, and finished in second place in the Eastern Division. Former Eagles owner and co-founder Bert Bell had become NFL commissioner, and attended the Eagles game on October 11 at Franklin Field against the Pittsburgh Steelers, a team Bell used to own. Bell refused the box seats that the Eagles reserved for him and purchased his own tickets to sit with the fans.\n\n## Super Bowl champions (1960)\n\nThe Eagles' 1960 season remains one of the most celebrated year in team history. Shaw, Van Brocklin, and Bednarik, each in their last season before retirement, led an Eagles team more notable for its grit than its talent. One observer later quipped that the team had \"nothing but a championship\" to its first division title since 1949. The team was aided by their two Pro Bowl receivers, wide receiver Tommy McDonald, who later wrote an autobiography titled \"They Pay Me to Catch Footballs\", and tight end Pete Retzlaff.\n\n## Leonard Tose era (1969-1984)\n\nIn 1969, Leonard Tose bought the team from Wolman for $16.155 million, the equivalent of $134 million today, representing a record then for the highest amount ever paid for a professional sports franchise. Tose's first official act was to fire Coach Joe Kuharich after a disappointing 24–41–1 record during his five-year reign. Tose then named former Eagles wide receiver Pete Retzlaff the team's general manager and Jerry Williams as its new head coach.\n\n## Dick Vermeil years (1976-1982)\n\nIn 1976, Dick Vermeil was hired from UCLA to coach the struggling Eagles, who had managed only one winning season from 1962 to 1975. Vermeil faced numerous obstacles as he attempted to rejuvenate a franchise that had not seriously contended in well over a decade. Despite the team's young talent and Gabriel's occasional flashes of brilliance, the Eagles finished 1976 with the same 4–10 record as in 1975.\n\n## Doug Pederson years (2016-2020)\n\nThe Eagles hired Kansas City Chiefs' offensive coordinator Doug Pederson as their next head coach on January 18, 2016. Pederson had been with the Chiefs for the preceding three years after having spent the four seasons before those with the Eagles. He served as a quality control assistant coach for the Eagles in 2009 and 2010 before being promoted to quarterbacks coach for the 2011 and 2012 seasons.\n\n## Super Bowl LII champions (2017)\n\nThe Eagles had a 13–3 record in 2017, including a nine-game winning streak. In a week 14 game against the Los Angeles Rams, starting quarterback Carson Wentz left the game with a torn anterior cruciate ligament, and backup Nick Foles took over for the rest of the season. Wentz was considered to have been playing at an MVP level at the time of his injury. Foles's first start was a comeback from a 20–7 deficit against the New York Giants where he scored four touchdowns to win 34–29. Foles struggled in the last two games of the season against the Oakland Raiders and the Dallas Cowboys and threw a touchdown and two interceptions in those two games. Despite this, the Eagles clinched home-field advantage after the win against Oakland in week 16. Foles led the Eagles past the Atlanta Falcons in the Divisional Round 15–10. In the NFC Championship game, the Eagles beat the Minnesota Vikings 38–7, despite being betting underdogs. Foles had his best game since week 15 and threw for 352 passing yards and three touchdowns.\n\n## Nick Sirianni years (2021-present)\n\nThe Eagles hired former Indianapolis Colts' offensive coordinator Nick Sirianni as their next head coach on January 21, 2021. During the offseason, the Eagles traded starting quarterback Carson Wentz to the Colts for a 2021 third-round draft pick and a 2022 conditional second-round pick. In doing so, Wentz was reunited with Frank Reich, head coach of the Colts who served as the Eagles' offensive coordinator for Wentz's first two years in Philadelphia, including during their Super Bowl-winning season in 2017.\n\n## Rivalries\n\nThe Eagles and Dallas Cowboys rivalry has been listed among the best and most acrimonious in the NFL. The Eagles won the first game in this rivalry 27–25 on September 30, 1960. Dallas leads the all-time series 74–56 as of the 2023 season, but in recent years, the series has been close, with each team winning 12 games since 2006. There is considerable hostility between the two teams' fan bases, with incidents such as the 1989 Bounty Bowl. The rivalry has even spilled over into draft weekend, with Cowboys legend Drew Pearson and Eagles legend David Akers exchanging insults at the opposing franchise in 2017 and 2018, respectively.\n\n## Awards and honors\n\nIn 1987, the Eagles Honor Roll was established. Every Eagles player who had been elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame at that point was among the inaugural induction class. By 2012, the Honor Roll had been retitled as the Eagles Hall of Fame. Players are considered for induction three years after their retirement from the NFL, and there have been 47 inductees into the Eagles Hall of Fame as of 2019.\n\n## Franchise records\n\nThe following players below have franchise records for the Eagles: Steve Van Buren (rushing yards, 6,493), Roman Gabriel (passing yards, 16,813), Tommy McDonald (receptions, 407), and Pete Retzlaff (receptions, 536).\n\n## Radio and television\n\nThe Eagles' radio affiliates include WIP-FM (94.1 FM), WPHT-AM (1210 AM), and 97.5 The Fanatic (97.5 FM).\n\n## Training camp\n\nThe Eagles previously held their preseason training camp from the end of July through mid-August each year at Lehigh University in Bethlehem in the Lehigh Valley. In 2013, with the addition of head coach Chip Kelly, the Eagles moved their training camp to the NovaCare Complex in Philadelphia.\n\n## Fight song\n\nThis fight song is heard during Eagles' home games after touchdowns and before the team is introduced prior to kickoff.\n\n## Eagles' cheerleaders\n\nThe Eagles have their own cheerleading squad, which performs a variety of dance routines for the fans and the Eagles on the sideline. The squad also releases a swimsuit calendar each year, and is the first squad in the league to release the calendar on the Android and iOS mobile systems.\n\n## Fans\n\nAlthough the method may vary, studies that attempt to rank the 32 fan bases in the NFL consistently place Eagles fans among the best in the league, noting their \"unmatched fervor.\" American City Business Journals, which conducts a regular study to determine the most loyal fans in the NFL, ranked Eagles fans third in both 1999 and 2006. The 2006 study called Eagles fans \"incredibly loyal\", noting that they filled 99.8% of the seats in the stadium over the previous decade. Forbes placed the Eagles fans first in its 2008 survey, which was based on the correlation between team performance and fan attendance. ESPN.com placed Eagles fans fourth in the league in its 2008 survey, citing the connection between the team's performance and the mood of the city.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style

Loyola Athletic Club In keeping with Yellow Jackets tradition, they carried the \"Frankford\" name again in 1912, to become the Frankford Athletic Association.\n\n\nBell and Wray era (1933–1940)\nAfter more than a year of searching for a suitable replacement for the Yellow Jackets in the lucrative Philadelphia market, the National Football League granted an expansion franchise to an ownership group headed by Bert Bell and Lud Wray, who were also awarded the liquidated assets of the defunct Yellow Jackets organization The Bell–Wray group had to pay an entry fee of $3,500, or roughly US$67,000 in inflation-adjusted 2022 dollars, and assumed a total debt of $11,000 the Yellow Jackets owed to three other NFL franchises [15] Drawing inspiration from the Blue Eagle logo of the National Recovery Administration, a centerpiece of President Franklin D Roosevelt's New Deal policies, [15] Bell and Wray named their new franchise the Philadelphia Eagles While it could seem as if the Yellow Jackets simply rebranded as the Eagles, both the Eagles organization and NFL officially regard the teams as two separate entities Not only was there no Philadelphia NFL team for a season and a half, but almost no players from the 1931 Yellow Jackets appeared on the Eagles' first roster.\n\n\nThompson, Wolman and the Happy Hundred era (1941–1969)\nIn December 1940, Bell intervened to stop the sale of Art Rooney's Steelers to Alexis Thompson, [25] and Rooney then acquired half of Bell's interest in the Eagles [26] In a series of events known as the Pennsylvania Polka, [25] Rooney and Bell exchanged their entire Eagles roster and their territorial rights in Philadelphia to Thompson for his entire Steelers roster and his rights in Pittsburgh [27] Rooney provided assistance to Bell by rewarding him with a 20% commission on the sale of the Steelers [28] Bell became the Steelers' head coach and Rooney became the Steelers' general manager [29]\n\n\nGreasy Neale years (1941–1950)\nAfter assuming ownership, Thompson promptly hired Greasy Neale as the team's head coach During the first years under Neale, the Eagles' struggles continued, and they finished the 1941 season with a 2–8–1 record [30] In the 1942 season, there was no improvement as the team finished the season 2–9 [31]\n\n\nSteagles (1943)\nIn 1943, with player shortages stemming from the U.S entry engagement in World War II, it became difficult to fill the roster, and the team merged with the Steelers to form the \"Phil-Pitt Eagles\", known as the Steagles [32] Greasy Neale continued to coach the team along with Steelers head coach Walt Kiesling The team finished the 1943 season with a 5–4–1 record, and the merger, which was never intended to be a permanent arrangement, was dissolved at the season's end [33]\n\n\nNFL champions (1948)\nUndeterred, the young team rebounded in 1948 to return to the NFL Championship game With home field advantage and a blinding snowstorm on their side, the Eagles won their first NFL Championship against the Chicago Cardinals by a score of 7–0 [36] The only score came in the fourth quarter when Steve Van Buren ran for a five-yard touchdown [37] Because of the severe weather, few fans witnessed the joyous occasion.\n\n\nNFL champions (1949)\nIn 1949, the Eagles returned to the NFL Championship game for a third consecutive year The Eagles were favored by a touchdown, [39] [40] [41] and won 14–0 for their second consecutive title game shutout Running back Steve Van Buren rushed for 196 yards on 31 carries for the Eagles, and their defense held the Rams to just 21 yards on the ground [42] Chuck Bednarik was selected as the first overall pick in the 1949 NFL draft An All-American lineman/linebacker from the University of Pennsylvania, Bednarik would go on to become one of the greatest and most beloved players in Eagles history.\n\n\nBuck Shaw years (1958–1960)\nIn 1958, the Eagles took several steps to improve, hiring Buck Shaw as head coach and acquiring quarterback Norm Van Brocklin in a trade with the Los Angeles Rams During the 1959 season, the team showed flashes of talent, and finished in second place in the Eastern Division Former Eagles owner and co-founder Bert Bell had become NFL commissioner, and attended the Eagles game on October 11 at Franklin Field against the Pittsburgh Steelers, a team Bell used to own Bell refused the box seats that the Eagles reserved for him and purchased his own tickets to sit with the fans During the fourth quarter, while sitting behind the end zone, Bell suffered a heart attack and died later that day.\n\n\nNFL champions (1960)\nThe Eagles' 1960 season remains one of the most celebrated year in team history Shaw, Van Brocklin, and Bednarik, each in their last season before retirement, led an Eagles team more notable for its grit than its talent One observer later quipped that the team had \"nothing but a championship\" to its first division title since 1949 The team was aided by their two Pro Bowl receivers, wide receiver Tommy McDonald, who later wrote an autobiography titled They Pay Me to Catch Footballs, and tight end Pete Retzlaff.\n\n\nLeonard Tose era (1969–1984)\nIn 1969, Leonard Tose bought the team from Wolman for $16.155 million, [49] the equivalent of $134 million today, representing a record then for the highest amount ever paid for a professional sports franchise Tose's first official act was to fire Coach Joe Kuharich after a disappointing 24–41–1 record during his five-year reign Tose then named former Eagles wide receiver Pete Retzlaff the team's general manager and Jerry Williams as its new head coach.\n\n\nDick Vermeil years (1976–1982)\nIn 1976, Dick Vermeil was hired from UCLA to coach the struggling Eagles, who had managed only one winning season from 1962 to 1975 [54] Vermeil faced numerous obstacles as he attempted to rejuvenate a franchise that had not seriously contended in well over a decade Despite the team's young talent and Gabriel's occasional flashes of brilliance, the Eagles finished 1976 with the same 4–10 record as in 1975 In 1977, the first seeds of hope began to emerge The team obtained hard-throwing quarterback Ron Jaworski in a trade from the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for popular tight end Charle Young The defense, led by Bergey and defensive coordinator Marion Campbell, began earning a reputation as one of the hardest-hitting in the league.\n\n\nNorman Braman era (1985–1993)\nIn 1985, Tose was forced to sell the Eagles to Norman Braman and Ed Leibowitz, highly successful automobile dealers from Florida, for a reported $65 million (equal to $184 million today) to pay off his more than $25 million ($71 million today) in gambling debts at Atlantic City casinos [60] The team again struggled during the 1985 season, and Campbell was fired after week 16, to be replaced by assistant head coach/defensive backs coach Fred Bruney for the season's last game [61]\n\n\nBuddy Ryan years (1986–1990)\nIn 1986, the arrival of head coach Buddy Ryan and his fiery attitude sparked team performance and ignited the fan base Immediately infusing the team with his hard-as-nails attitude, the Eagles quickly became known for their tough defense and tougher attitudes [63] Ryan began rejuvenating the team by releasing several aging players, including Ron Jaworski Randall Cunningham took his place and, despite a 5–10–1 season, began showing considerable promise 1987 saw another strike, which shortened the season by one game [64] The substitutes who had filled in for the strikers performed poorly and were crushed 41–22 by the Dallas Cowboys After the strike, the regular Eagles' 1987 team won a 37–20 revenge game against Dallas The season record was 7–8, of which three games had been played by substitutes.\n\n\nJeffrey Lurie era (1994–present)\nBy 1994, team owner Norman Braman had become largely unpopular among local fans and a polarizing presence in the front office Jeffrey Lurie bought the Eagles on May 6, 1994, for an estimated $185 million [71] The club is now estimated to be the 21st most valuable sports team, worth $3.4 billion, as evaluated in 2021 by Forbes [72]\n\n\nAndy Reid years (1999–2012)\nThe Eagles reemerged as a predominant NFL team under the leadership of new head coach Andy Reid, who was hired away from the Green Bay Packers, where he was the Packers' quarterback coach Reid's first notable step was drafting Syracuse quarterback Donovan McNabb with the second overall pick in the 1999 NFL draft [86] The Eagles' awful 1998 season would have entitled the Eagle to first pick but it was awarded to the rebooted Cleveland Browns Despite clearing the roster for new talent by releasing unpopular and aging veterans such as Ricky Watters and Irving Fryar, Reid was still a virtual unknown before his arrival as head coach, and his appointment was met initially with skepticism among Philadelphia fans The drafting of McNabb was unpopular with many Eagles fans, many of whom traveled to Madison Square Garden for the 1999 Draft and booed the selection, believing the Eagles instead should have selected Ricky Williams, a University of Texas running back who had been named the 1998 AP College Player of the Year.\n\n\nChip Kelly years (2013–2015)\nOn January 16, 2013, after a 4–12 season, the Eagles brought in University of Oregon head coach Chip Kelly to succeed Reid as head coach [111] The Philadelphia Eagles named Michael Vick the starting quarterback going into the 2013 season with much promise running Chip Kelly's fast-paced spread offense [112] The 2013 season proved very successful for the Eagles While a hamstring injury took Michael Vick out after a 1–3 start, his backup Nick Foles led the team to a 10–6 regular-season record and its seventh NFC East title in 13 seasons, but the Eagles lost to the New Orleans Saints in the wild card round Before throwing his first interception in Week 14, Foles had thrown 19 touchdowns, just one shy of the all-time NFL record of consecutive touchdowns without an interception to start a season, set earlier in the season by Peyton Manning Foles also tied Manning for most touchdown passes in a single game, with seven, against the Oakland Raiders, which also made him the youngest player in NFL history to throw for that many touchdowns in a game Foles finished the regular season with 27 touchdown passes and only 2 interceptions, giving him the then-best TD-INT ratio in NFL history (That record was later broken by Tom Brady, in the 2016 season.) He also finished with a 119.0 passer rating, third-highest in league history behind only Aaron Rodgers in 2011 and Peyton Manning in 2004 He was also only the second quarterback in NFL history to have a game in which he topped 400 passing yards and a perfect passer rating LeSean McCoy finished his Pro Bowl season as the league's top rusher with 1,607 rushing yards (also a franchise record) and 2,146 total yards from scrimmage, also best in the NFL As a whole, the Eagles offense scored 51 touchdowns, most in franchise history, passing the previous season-high set back in 1948 Following the 2013 season, the Eagles released Pro-Bowl wide receiver DeSean Jackson due to his poor \"work ethic and attitude\", as well as speculation of his involvement in gang-related activities [113] The team signed All Pro safety Malcolm Jenkins to a three-year contract, worth $16.25 million [114]\n\n\nDoug Pederson years (2016–2020)\nThe Eagles hired Kansas City Chiefs' offensive coordinator Doug Pederson as their next head coach on January 18, 2016 [126] Pederson had been with the Chiefs for the preceding three years after having spent the four seasons before those with the Eagles He served as a quality control assistant coach for the Eagles in 2009 and 2010 before being promoted to quarterbacks coach for the 2011 and 2012 seasons He had been praised for his work with Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith over the prior several seasons, particularly 2015, as the Chiefs moved into the top 10 in scoring offense [127] [128]\n\n\nSuper Bowl LII champions (2017)\nThe Eagles had a 13–3 record in 2017, including a nine-game winning streak [138] In a week 14 game against the Los Angeles Rams, starting quarterback Carson Wentz left the game with a torn anterior cruciate ligament, and backup Nick Foles, who had been re-signed in the off-season, took over for the rest of the season [139] Wentz was considered to have been playing at an MVP level at the time of his injury [140] [141] Foles's first start was a comeback from a 20–7 deficit against the New York Giants where he scored four touchdowns to win 34–29 [142] Foles struggled in the last two games of the season against the Oakland Raiders and the Dallas Cowboys and threw a touchdown and two interceptions in those two games [143] Despite this, the Eagles clinched home-field advantage after the win against Oakland in week 16 Foles led the Eagles past the Atlanta Falcons in the Divisional Round 15–10 [144] In the NFC Championship game, the Eagles beat the Minnesota Vikings 38–7, despite having been betting underdogs [145] Foles had his best game since week 15 and threw for 352 passing yards and three touchdowns [146] The Eagles traveled to Minneapolis to compete in Super Bowl LII, their third attempt at a title, against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots in a rematch of Super Bowl XXXIX from 2005 [147]\n\n\nNick Sirianni years (2021–present)\nThe Eagles hired former Indianapolis Colts' offensive coordinator Nick Sirianni as their next head coach on January 21, 2021 [188] During the offseason, the Eagles traded starting quarterback Carson Wentz to the Colts for a 2021 third-round draft pick and a 2022 conditional second-round pick [189] In doing so, Wentz was reunited with Frank Reich, head coach of the Colts who served as the Eagles' offensive coordinator for Wentz's first two years in Philadelphia, including during their Super Bowl-winning season in 2017 The Eagles absorbed a $33.8-million dead-cap hit for trading Wentz [190]\n\n\nChampionships\nThe Eagles were a part of the NFL Eastern Division from 1933 to 1949, the National Conference from 1950 to 1953, and the Eastern Conference from 1953 to 1966 They were then placed in the Capitol Division of the Eastern Conference in

when both teams came to relative prominence in the 1940s and 1950s The two teams have played in the same division in the NFL every year since 1933 The ferocity of the rivalry can also be attributed to the geographic New York-Philadelphia rivalry, which is mirrored in Major League Baseball's Mets–Phillies and the NHL's Flyers–Rangers and Flyers–Islanders It is ranked by NFL Network as one of the greatest rivalries of all time, [223] Sports Illustrated ranks it as the fourth best NFL rivalry of all time, [8] and according to ESPN, it is one of the fiercest and most well-known rivalries in the football community [224] As of the 2023 season, the Eagles lead the all-time series 94–89–2 [225]\n\n\nWashington Commanders\nWhile not as big as the rivalries with the Giants and Cowboys, the Eagles' historical rivalry with the Washington Redskins / Washington Football Team / Washington Commanders has still been fierce Although the two franchises played in the same division in the Eagles'

both located in Pennsylvania and began play in 1933 [232] From that season through 1966, this was a major rivalry for both teams, as both were part of the same division In 1967 they were placed in separate divisions, but remained in the same conference for three years In 1970 the Steelers (along with the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Colts) moved to the American Football Conference, while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old-line NFL teams in the National Football Conference As a result, the Eagles and Steelers no longer played each other every year; instead, they are scheduled to meet once every four years in the regular season The most recent meeting was in 2022 at Lincoln Financial Field due to the addition of a regular season game based on opposing conference divisional finish from the season before, with the Eagles winning 35–13 The Steelers have lost ten straight games on the road against the Eagles dating back to 1966, which was also the start of the Super Bowl

have had an intimate relationship with him for over twenty years (she stated in another interview that it was \"a love relationship of 33 years\") [citation needed] The prosecutor of Montargis dismissed the two complaints filed by the three Delon children against Rollin due to insufficiently characterized offenses [citation needed] Rollin's complaint, filed in response against the Delon children, was dismissed for the same reasons However, Rollin's lawyer announced that his client planned to file a complaint with a civil party in order to restart the investigations Anthony Delon, on

he could continue to be treated there She then announced plans to sue for defamation, false accusations, threats, and harassment against Anthony Delon [103] Furthermore, Alain Delon's lawyer asserted that his client \"cannot bear the aggressiveness of his son Anthony, who keeps telling him that he is senile\" On 29 March 2024, Anouchka Delon sued her brothers for invasion of privacy after the broadcast of a recording in January 2024 on Instagram of a conversation between her and her father [104] Anthony and Alain-Fabien will thus be judged for \"use, retention, or disclosure of a document or recording obtained by an invasion of another's privacy\" The trial date is set for April 2025 Physically weakened by cancer, Delon was placed under reinforced guardianship by judicial decision in April 2024, following a hearing at the Montargis court, in the presence of the actor's three children [105] This measure follows a period during which Delon had already been placed under guardianship

Marcel Delon is a French actor, singer, and businessman, born on November 8, 1935, in Sceaux, a wealthy suburb of Paris. He is one of the most iconic and influential actors in French cinema, known for his charismatic on-screen presence, versatility, and timeless style.\n\nFamily\nThe Delons are originally from Saint-Vincent-Lespinasse, in Tarn-et-Garonne. Their known genealogy goes back to Jean Delon, born in the fifteenth century. Delon's paternal great-grandfather, Fabien Patrick Delon, was a civil engineer who was decorated with the Legion of Honour in 1892. His paternal grandmother, Marie-Antoinette Evangelista, was Corsican. Delon's parents, François Fabien Delon and Édith Marie Suzanne Arnold, were a petit-bourgeois family.\n\nEarly life\nAlain Delon was born at 99 Houdan Street on November 8, 1935, in Sceaux, a wealthy suburb of Paris. His father, François Fabien Delon, was a projectionist and later the director of the cinema Le Régina in Bourg-la-Reine. His mother, Édith Marie Suzanne Arnold, was an assistant employed in a pharmacy and a theater usher at the cinema. Delon's childhood was marked by his parents' divorce when he was five years old. He was sent to live with his maternal grandparents in Craponne-sur-Arzon, where he spent his early years.\n\nChildhood and education: 1935–1952\nAlain Delon discovered the bustling Saint-Germain-des-Prés district and at the Club Saint-Germain met the actress Brigitte Auber, who had recently acted for the director Alfred Hitchcock in To Catch a Thief. They lived together on rue du Pré-aux-Clercs, in the 7th arrondissement of Paris. This experience distanced Delon from the underworld and changed his career path.\n\nMilitary service and Indochina War: 1952–1956\nBefore joining the French cinema, Delon joined the French Navy at the age of 17. He anticipated the call-up for military service and chose to join the Navy to avoid the draft. Delon continued his service in 1953 at the Bormette Signals School. He fought in the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954.\n\nActing career\nDelon discovered the French cinema and entered the world of acting without any particular training. He was \"spotted\" by Henry Willson, who was in charge of recruiting new talent on behalf of the American film producer David O Selznick. Delon's breakthrough role was in the comedy Women Are Weak (1959), which was a big hit in France. He made some personal appearances in New York to promote the movie.\n\nFrench stardom and international fame: 1959–1964\nDelon's lead role in Women Are Weak (1959) marked the beginning of his rise to stardom in France. He became a leading man in movie roles and an international sex symbol. During this period, Delon starred in several successful films, including Purple Noon (1960), Rocco and His Brothers (1960), and L'Eclisse (1962).\n\nHollywood star: 1964–1966\nDelon spent the next few years focused on Hollywood. He was typecast as a \"Latin lover\" and appeared in several films, including The Yellow Rolls-Royce (1964) and Fata Morgana (1965). Delon said that he wanted to make a picture in America and one in Europe each year. He also said that his accent prevented him from playing certain roles: \"Because of my accent, I would not attempt to play Americans. I am working on removing the distinctly French inflections from my speech so that I can play all continental nationalities.\"\n\nReturn to France: 1967–1971\nAfter one British movie and four Hollywood movies, Delon returned to France to rejoin the French cinema. He starred in the film The Last Adventure opposite Lino Ventura. This film was one of Delon's most popular films of the 1960s but was not popular in North America. Delon also appeared on the Paris stage in Les Yeux Crevés and starred in the neo-noir crime thriller Le Samouraï ('The Samurai') with Jean-Pierre Melville, which became another film classic.\n\nEstablished actor and more international films\nIn the early 1970s, Delon made another attempt at the English-speaking market. The Assassination of Trotsky (1972) for Joseph Losey was poorly received, but Red Sun (1972), with Charles Bronson and Toshiro Mifune, did well. In France, Delon appeared opposite Simone Signoret in The Widow Couderc (1971). He starred in his third film with Melville, Un flic in 1972, as well as in the thrillers Traitement de choc (1973), and Tony Arzenta (1973).\n\n1970s\nIn the early 1970s, Delon continued to appear in a variety of films, including The Widow Couderc (1971), Un flic (1972), and La Piscine (1979). He also produced and starred in a romantic drama, Indian Summer (1972).\n\nLater career\nIn the 1980s, Delon appeared in a number of films, including The Pied Piper (1972), The Hunter Will Get You (1980), and The Judge (1989). He also produced and starred in a number of films, including Monsieur Klein (1976) and The Man from Acapulco (1989).\n\n1980s and 1990s\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Delon appeared in a number of films, including The Widow Couderc (1971), Un flic (1972), and La Piscine (1979).

He was married to actress Romy Schneider from 1962 to 1964, and they had two children together. Delon has also been linked to a number of other famous women, including actress Brigitte Auber and singer Sylvie Vartan.\n\nHealth\nIn 2019, Delon suffered a stroke, which left him with partial paralysis. He was hospitalized in Switzerland and underwent rehabilitation. In 2022, Delon was diagnosed with lymphoma and began treatment. He has since been open about his health struggles and has used his platform to raise awareness about the importance of health and wellness.\n\nLegacy\nDelon is widely regarded as one of the greatest actors of all time, known for his charisma, versatility, and timeless style.

leave the residence in Douchy-Montcorbon A preliminary investigation was opened on 6 July On 7 July, Yassine Bouzrou, lawyer for Hiromi Rollin, stated that she disputed \"the entirety of the facts\" [95] [96] Bouzrou added that she would file a complaint against members of the Delon family and their bodyguards for aggravated voluntary violence suffered by Rollin on 5 July 2023 [97] [98]

stated in another interview that it was \"a love relationship of 33 years\") [citation needed] The prosecutor of Montargis dismissed the two complaints filed by the three Delon children against Rollin due to insufficiently characterized offenses [citation needed] Rollin's complaint, filed in response against the Delon children, was dismissed for the same reasons However, Rollin's lawyer announced that his client planned to file a complaint with a civil party in order to restart the investigations Anthony Delon, on his part, intended to become a civil party against Rollin so that \"the truth is revealed\" [citation needed]\n\n\nFamily civil dispute\nOn 4 January 2024, Alain Delon filed a complaint against his son Anthony following an interview granted by the latter to Paris Match magazine

that his father was \"weakened\" and that he \"can't bear to see himself like this, diminished\" Subsequently, Anthony Delon filed a police report against Anouchka, accusing her of not informing the family about the negative results of five cognitive tests conducted by their father between 2019 and 2022, after he suffered a severe stroke in 2019 [102] Anouchka Delon, on the other hand, accused her brothers of endangering their father's life and claimed to have wanted to take their father to Switzerland so he could continue to be treated there She then announced plans to sue for defamation, false accusations, threats, and harassment against Anthony Delon [103] Furthermore, Alain Delon's lawyer asserted that his client \"cannot bear the aggressiveness of his son Anthony, who keeps telling him that he is senile\" On 29 March 2024, Anouchka Delon sued her brothers for invasion of privacy after the broadcast of a recording in January 2024 on Instagram of a conversation between her and her father [104] Anthony and Alain-Fabien will thus be judged for \"use, retention, or disclosure of a document or recording obtained by an invasion of another's privacy\" The trial date is set for April 2025 Physically weakened by cancer, Delon was placed under reinforced guardianship by judicial decision in April 2024, following a hearing at the Montargis court, in the presence of the actor's three children [105] This measure follows a period during which Delon had already been placed under guardianship since 25 January, and notably granted the curator appointed by the judge the power to manage

paparazzi relentlessly pursuing them [112] Schneider's family remained opposed to their union, adding further complexities to their romance [112] [113] In 1964, Delon and Schneider ended their relationship [114] Their love story continued to captivate audiences and cemented their status as one of the most beautiful couples in cinema history [115] In 2009, Delon admitted his regret at not marrying Schneider, [116] and in 2018 he referred to her as the love of his life [117]\n\n\nRelationships and family\nOn 20 March 1959, Delon became engaged to actress Romy Schneider, whom he met when

Her singing caught the attention of rock artists Steve Thomas and Jennifer Knapp from Nashville, Tennessee, who brought her there to improve her writing skills. In Nashville, she started recording demos and learned how to write songs and play guitar. Perry signed with Red Hill Records and recorded her debut album, a contemporary Christian record titled Katy Hudson, which was released on March 6, 2001. She also went on tour that year as part of Phil Joel's Strangely Normal Tour and embarked on other performances of her own in the United States.\n\n## 2007–2009: Breakthrough with One of the Boys\nAfter Columbia dropped Perry, Angelica Cob-Baehler, then a publicity executive at the label, brought Perry's demos to Virgin Records chairman Jason Flom. Flom was convinced that she could be a breakthrough star and she was signed to Capitol Records in April 2007. The label arranged for her to work with Dr Luke to add an \"undeniable smash\" to her existing material. Perry and Dr Luke co-wrote the songs \"I Kissed a Girl\" and \"Hot n Cold\" for her second album One of the Boys. A campaign was started with the November 2007 release of the video to \"Ur So Gay,\" a song aimed at introducing her to the music market.

She also served as a guest judge on British The X Factor later that month before releasing the album's second single, \"Teenage Dream,\" in July. \"Teenage Dream\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in September. Released on August 24, 2010, Teenage Dream debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and received mixed reviews from music critics. It has since sold 6 million copies worldwide.

She told Billboard, \"I know exactly the record I want to make next. I know the artwork, the coloring and the tone.\" and \"I even know what type of tour I'm doing next. I'll be very pleased if the vision I have in my head becomes a reality.\" After initially telling L'Uomo Vogue in June 2012 that she planned to have \"darker elements\" in Prism following the end of her marriage, the singer revealed to MTV during the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards that she changed the album's direction after periods of self-reflection.

It was promoted at the MTV Video Music Awards and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n## 2016–2018: Witness and American Idol\nPerry started writing songs for her new album in June 2016, and recorded an anthem for NBC Sports's coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympics titled \"Rise,\" which was released the following month. Perry chose to release it as a standalone track rather than save it for her album \"because now more than ever, there is a need for our world to unite.\" NBC also felt its message spoke \"directly to the spirit of the Olympics and its athletes\" for its inspirational themes. The song reached number one in Australia and number eleven in the United States.\n\n## 2019–2020: Smile and Motherhood\nAt the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, Perry performed \"Here You Come Again\" alongside Dolly Parton and Kacey Musgraves, as part of a tribute to Parton. Four days later, she released a song called \"365\" with DJ Zedd. In April, Perry was included on a remix of Daddy Yankee's song \"Con Calma,\" featuring Snow. She followed this with the singles \"Never Really Over\" on May 31, \"Small Talk\" on August 9, and \"Harleys in Hawaii\" on October 16. \"Never Really Over\" in particular received critical acclaim.\n\n## 2021–2023: Play Residency\nOn January 20, 2021, Perry performed \"Firework\" at the Celebrating America concert during the inauguration of Joe Biden. Four months later, she released a new single, \"Electric,\" a collaboration with Pokémon as part of its 25th anniversary. That December, Perry followed this with \"When I'm Gone,\" a collaboration with Swedish DJ Alesso, that made her the third person to reach number one on Croatia's ARC 100 list across three different decades following Lady Gaga and Coldplay.\n\nArtistry\n## Influences\nPerry cites her sister Angela as the woman who has had the most influence on her.

She cites the band's frontman, Freddie Mercury, as her biggest influence and expressed how the \"combination of his sarcastic approach to writing lyrics and his 'I don't give a fuck' attitude\" inspired her music. She paid homage to the band by naming her third fragrance Killer Queen.

All of the melody choices that I make are because of Pet Sounds.\" The singer also holds the Beatles' album The Beatles in high esteem, and described these two albums as \"the only things I listened to for probably two years straight.\"\n\n## Voice\nPerry has a contralto vocal range. Her singing has received both praise and criticism. Betty Clarke of The Guardian commented that her \"powerful voice is hard-edged.\" While Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone described Perry's vocals on Teenage Dream as \"processed staccato blips.\" Darren Harvey of musicOMH compared Perry's vocals on One of the Boys to Alanis Morissette's, both possessing a \"perky voice shifting octaves mid-syllable.\" Alex Miller from NME felt that \"Perry's problem is often her voice\" on One of the Boys, stating that \"somewhere along the line someone convinced her she was like, well, a ballsy rock chick.\" Conversely, Bernadette McNulty from The Daily Telegraph praised her \"rock chick voice\" in a review of a concert promoting Prism.\n\nPublic Image\nOn social media, Perry surpassed Justin Bieber as the most followed person on Twitter in November 2013.

dialogues at home, working remotely with Don Mancini [59] Between March and April of the following year, many other actors already linked to the franchise were confirmed to have recurring roles, including Jennifer Tilly as Tiffany Valentine, Alex Vincent as Andy Barclay, Christine Elise as Kyle, and Fiona Dourif as Nica Pierce [7] [60] [61] Fiona also plays an adult version of Charles Lee Ray, but her voice was replaced with Brad's in post-production [62] A reason for this was that Nica sounded too similar when possessed by Charles, which would have been \"confusing\" for the audience [62] All these actors renewed their contract for the second season between April and May 2022 [63] [64]\n\n\nFilming\nFilming for the series was scheduled to start in the fourth quarter of 2020, but it was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic [82] Shooting for the first season officially began on March 29, 2021, and concluded on August 11, 2021, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada [1] The Square One parking lot in Mississauga was used as a \"base camp\" for the production team [83] Tony Gardner and Peter Chevako developed Chucky's look with the goal to make him look exactly like in Child's Play 2 [84] This was because, from Mancini's standpoint, the first sequel seems to be the general fan favorite [8] It took group of six or seven puppeteers to make Chucky move, which represents 99.5% of the doll's actions, according to Mancini, who has expressed his preference to do things practically over using computer-generated images [44] Digital effects were only used to erase puppeteers from screen or any implements required by the animatronic, such as rods or cables [42] A child named Jacob sometimes performed as a double [44] [69]\n\n\nMusic\nJoseph LoDuca served as the series' composer, as he did in Curse of Chucky and Cult of Chucky [94] For the show, he read the scripts beforehand and waited until the scenes were filmed to figure out ways to add a fitting soundtrack [94] Piano chords are used sometimes throughout the first season as an accompaniment to Jake and Devon's relationship, since the latter is seen playing that same instrument in the first episode [94] LoDuca also utilized a detuned toy piano to symbolize Chucky's \"feigned innocence\" in the first season [95] A similar theme was used to imply \"something more sinister\" to what was happening in certain scenes [94] A different version of the Child's Play 2 theme can also be heard in scenes involving Chucky and Caroline [94] LoDuca described the score for Tiffany as \"lush\", which helps present her as a \"classic Hollywood vamp\", while the flashbacks showing how she and Charles Lee Ray became a couple have a \"80's synth vibe\" [95] Likewise, the show features licensed music by groups and solo artists like Billie Eilish, Kim Petras, Electric Youth, The Go-Go's, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Shaed, Rob Zombie, and Blue Öyster Cult, amongst many others [96]\n\n\nPromotion and broadcast\nAdvertised as a \"coming of rage\" story, [16] Chucky premiered simultaneously on Syfy and USA Network on October 12, 2021 [8] Prior to the premiere, both channels released several promotional posters and videos, including one where Chucky reenacts the trailer for the 1978 film Magic with his classic voodoo chant to Damballa [16] [97] [98] [99] In June, Syfy presented the \"Pride of Chucky\" marathon, consisting of six of the seven films from the Child's Play franchise, in celebration of LGBTQ+ pride month [100] On October 8, Don Mancini, Zackary Arthur, Jennifer Tilly and Alex Vincent attended the New York Comic Con,

during NBCUniversal's presentation at the TCA Winter Press Tour in Pasadena, California, it was announced that Syfy had given the production a straight-to-series order, in a deal with Universal Content Productions [6] [39] While working on the show, Mancini was concerned about the potential impact the 2019 Child's Play reboot could have had in the franchise, speculating that, had it been a success, Universal Pictures could have decided to abandon the original film's continuity However, the reboot film (made without Mancini's approval) did not affect the TV show, and a sequel has not been produced [40] [41]\n\n\nCasting\nThe first teaser for the show, released on July 15, 2020, revealed that Brad Dourif would again provide the voice of Chucky [58] He initially recorded his dialogues at home, working remotely with Don Mancini [59] Between March and April of the following year, many other actors already linked to the franchise were confirmed to have recurring roles, including Jennifer Tilly as Tiffany Valentine, Alex Vincent as Andy Barclay, Christine Elise as Kyle, and Fiona Dourif as Nica Pierce [7] [60] [61] Fiona also plays an adult version of Charles Lee Ray, but her voice was replaced with Brad's in post-production [62] A reason for this was that Nica sounded too similar when possessed by Charles, which would have been \"confusing\" for the audience [62] All these actors renewed their contract for the second season between April and May 2022 [63] [64]\n\n\nFilming\nFilming for the series was scheduled to start in the fourth quarter of 2020, but it was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic [82] Shooting for the first season officially began on March 29, 2021, and concluded on August 11, 2021, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada [1] The Square One parking lot in Mississauga was used as a \"base camp\" for the production team [83] Tony Gardner and Peter Chevako developed Chucky's look with the goal to make him look exactly like in Child's Play 2 [84] This was because, from Mancini's standpoint, the first sequel seems to be the general fan favorite [8] It took group of six or seven puppeteers to make Chucky move, which represents 99.5% of the doll's actions, according to Mancini, who has expressed his preference to do things practically over using computer-generated images [44] Digital effects were only used to erase puppeteers from screen or any implements required by the animatronic, such as rods or cables [42] A child named Jacob sometimes performed as a double [44] [69]\n\n\nMusic\nJoseph LoDuca served as the series' composer, as he did in Curse of Chucky and Cult of Chucky [94] For the show, he read the scripts beforehand and waited until the scenes were filmed to figure out ways to add a fitting soundtrack [94] Piano chords are used sometimes throughout the first season as an accompaniment to Jake and Devon's relationship, since the latter is seen playing that same instrument in the first episode [94] LoDuca also utilized a detuned toy piano to symbolize Chucky's \"feigned innocence\" in the first season [95] A similar theme was used to imply \"something more sinister\" to what was happening in certain scenes [94] A different version of the Child's Play 2 theme can also be heard in scenes involving Chucky and Caroline [94] LoDuca described the score for Tiffany as \"lush\", which helps present her as a \"classic Hollywood vamp\", while the flashbacks showing how she and Charles Lee Ray became a couple have a \"80's synth vibe\" [95] Likewise, the show features licensed music by groups and solo artists like Billie Eilish, Kim Petras, Electric Youth, The Go-Go's, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Shaed, Rob Zombie, and Blue Öyster Cult, amongst many others [96]\n\n\nPromotion and broadcast\nAdvertised as a \"coming of rage\" story, [16] Chucky premiered simultaneously on Syfy and USA Network on October 12, 2021 [8] Prior to the premiere, both channels released several promotional posters and videos, including one where Chucky reenacts the trailer for the 1978 film Magic with his classic voodoo chant to Damballa [16] [97] [98] [99] In June, Syfy presented the \"Pride of Chucky\" marathon, consisting of six of the seven films from the Child's Play franchise, in celebration of LGBTQ+ pride month [100] On October 8, Don Mancini, Zackary Arthur, Jennifer Tilly and Alex Vincent attended the New York Comic Con, where a \"Good Guys\" branded ice cream truck was displayed [101] A screening of the first episode was also held at the same event [101]\n\n\nReception\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the first season holds an approval rating of 89% based on 36 critic reviews, with an average rating of 7/10 The website's critics consensus reads, \"A bloody good time that benefits greatly from Brad Dourif's return, Chucky may not play well for non-fans, but franchise devotees will find its absurd humor and creative horror very much intact on the small screen.\" [116] Metacritic gave the series a weighted average score of 70 out of 100 based on 10 critic reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\" [117]\n\n\nCritical response\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the first season holds an approval rating of 89% based on 36

for free, Chucky also gathered 2.9 million views combined in the United States by October 25 [126] Although it was the second most in-demand new TV series in mid-November, the sixth episode saw a 10.9% decrease in viewership as the Christmas season approached [128] The seventh episode, \"Twice the Grieving, Double the Loss\", was watched by 0.348 million viewers on USA Network and 0.350 million on Syfy, meaning an increase in viewership compared to the previous episode [129] The first season ended with its eighth episode and a smaller decrease in audience than the sixth, with 0.296 million viewers on Syfy and 0.313 million on USA Network [130]\n\n\nAccolades\nIn March 2024, Don Mancini announced he was in the early stages of development on a new Chucky movie that would work in tandem with the series [144] In September 2024, he stated that the Chucky franchise would continue following the cancellation of the television series [13]\n\n\nFuture\nIn March 2024, Don Mancini

Jokić**\n\nNikola Jokić (Serbian Cyrillic: Никола Јокић; born February 19, 1995) is a Serbian professional basketball player who plays as a center for the Denver Nuggets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He is widely regarded as one of the most dominant centers in the league, known for his exceptional passing ability, rebounding, and scoring prowess.\n\n**Early life**\n\nJokić was born in the city of Sombor in the northern part of Serbia. He grew up in a cramped two-bedroom apartment that housed him, his two brothers, parents, and grandmother. His father was an agricultural engineer, and Jokić developed a love of basketball early in his life playing with his two older brothers, Strahinja and Nemanja, who were a decade older. Both brothers played basketball in Serbia, with Nemanja later playing college basketball for Detroit Mercy and C.W Post and for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Steamers in the Premier Basketball League. The brothers are friends with former NBA player Darko Miličić. Jokić also loved harness racing as a child and competed as an amateur, a passion he still holds today.\n\n**Professional career**\n\nJokić played youth basketball for Vojvodina Srbijagas, drawing attention when he had achieved a total index rating greater than 50 in two consecutive games. In December 2012, Jokić signed a contract with Mega Vizura, although in the first season with the team he played mostly for their junior team in 2012–13. At the age of 17, Jokić appeared in five games of the Serbian League and averaged 1.8 points and 2.0 rebounds in 10.2 minutes per game. In February 2013, he officially signed a four-year contract with the team.\n\n**Mega Basket (2012–2015)**\n\nJokić played youth basketball for Vojvodina Srbijagas, drawing attention when he had achieved a total index rating greater than 50 in two consecutive games.

Jokić also became just the second Nugget to record a triple-double in the first two games of the season, joining Fat Lever. Jokić went on to earn Western Conference Player of the Week honors for the first week of the season, becoming the sixth player in franchise history to win the award three or more times, joining Alex English, Dikembe Mutombo, Carmelo Anthony, Allen Iverson, and Chauncey Billups.

of which four strengthened into major hurricanes Altogether, ten systems have made landfall this season \n\n\nEarly activity\nThough the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, it had its slowest start since 2014 This was due to a large stationary heat dome over Central America and Mexico, as tropical cyclogenesis in June often occurs over the Gulf of Mexico and northern Caribbean Sea [27] The season's first named storm, Tropical Storm Alberto, formed in the western Gulf of Mexico on June 19, [nb 2] [29] then proceeded to make landfall on the northeastern coast of Mexico the following day [30] Next came Hurricane Beryl, the earliest-forming Category 4 and Category 5 Atlantic hurricane on record in a season and the strongest June and July hurricane on record in the basin After forming on June 28 in the MDR, the storm rapidly intensified as it approached the Windward Islands, [31] [32] [33] peaking as a Category 5 hurricane early on July 2 [34] Short-lived Tropical Storm Chris developed in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico on June 30, [35] quickly moving ashore in Mexico the following morning [36] Beryl continued on, impacting Jamaica and landfalling on the Yucatán Peninsula and Texas [37] [38] [39] After Beryl dissipated on July 11, the Atlantic basin would fall under a period of inactivity due to the Saharan air layer, which suppresses tropical activity, persisting over the open Atlantic alongside dry air typically occurring during this period of the season [40]\n\n\nPeak to late season\nDespite the unseasonably warm temperatures in the North Atlantic, the equatorial Atlantic cooled rapidly into an \"Atlantic Niña\" due to upwelling caused by shifts in the trade winds and the Atlantic zonal mode The effects of an Atlantic Niña is not certain but it is contrary to the assumptions that the NOAA used in their forecast of seasonal activity [47] CSU associated the quietness of the Atlantic during the month of August and the period after Ernesto dissipated–despite predictions of an extremely active peak period–to tropical waves forming too far north, warm upper-level winds causing destabilization, wind shear in the East Atlantic, and factors associated with the Madden–Julian oscillation [48]\n\n\nSystems\nA Central American gyre resulted in the formation of convection over the Gulf of Tehuantepec on June 15 As the convective activity progressed northward over southeastern Mexico and exited into the Bay of Campeche, an area of low pressure gradually developed on June 17 about 105 miles (169 km) northwest of Ciudad del Carmen, Mexico The system gradually became better organized, though still remained rather broad, developing into Tropical Storm Alberto by 12:00 UTC on June 19 Under the influence of light vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, Alberto intensified up to landfall, attaining peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 992 mbar (29.29 inHg) by the morning of June 20 Alberto moved ashore at 09:00 UTC that day near Tampico, Mexico, and rapidly weakened over land, dissipating just nine hours later [64]\n\n\nTropical Storm Alberto\nA Central American gyre resulted in the formation of convection over the Gulf of Tehuantepec on June 15 As the convective activity progressed northward over southeastern Mexico and exited into the Bay of

weakened over land, dissipating just nine hours later [64]\n\n\nHurricane Beryl\nOn June 25, the NHC began monitoring a tropical wave producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms just south of Cabo Verde [75] The following day, the wave began showing signs of organization, with modest thunderstorm activity, curved bands, and some spin development [76] The disturbance further organized, becoming Tropical Depression Two over the central tropical Atlantic on June 28 [77] Located south of a strong subtropical ridge, the depression moved generally westward through an unusually favorable environment for the time of year with warm sea surface temperatures (SST) and minimal wind shear, consequently beginning a period of rapid intensification The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Beryl six hours after formation, [78] and the thunderstorms quickly organized into a central dense overcast, with a symmetric cloud pattern surrounded by rainbands [79] Late on June 29, Beryl intensified into a hurricane The inner core of the thunderstorms organized into an eye, [80] which became clear and symmetrical Observations from the Hurricane Hunters indicated that Beryl became a major hurricane on June 30 [81] The hurricane strengthened further into a Category 4 hurricane Beryl maintained an initial peak intensity with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) [82] Beryl then underwent an eyewall replacement cycle and briefly weakened to a Category 3 hurricane early on July 1, [83] but regained Category 4 strength six hours later once the cycle was completed [84] At 15:10 UTC the same day, Beryl made landfall in Carriacou, Grenada, with sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) [85] At 03:00 UTC the next day, Beryl further intensified into a Category 5 hurricane, [34] peaking a few hours later with winds of 165 mph (270 km/h), while moving to the west-northwest at about 20 mph (35 km/h) [86] Later that same day, Beryl passed south of Isla Beata, Dominican Republic, where it weakened to Category 4 strength [87] as a result of wind shear [88]\n\n\nTropical Storm Chris\nOn June 24, the NHC began monitoring a tropical wave east-southeast of the Windward Islands producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms [115] The disturbance moved generally westward across the Caribbean for several days, [116] before traversing the Yucatán Peninsula and emerging in the Bay of Campeche early on June 30 [117] There, an area of low pressure formed, which quickly became better organized Tropical Depression Three formed later that day, [118] and strengthened into Tropical Storm Chris six hours later [35] Shortly thereafter, the system made landfall in the municipality of Vega de Alatorre, Veracruz, at peak intensity [36] Chris rapidly weakened over the rough terrain of Mexico, dissipating early on July 1 [119]\n\n\nHurricane Debby\nOn July 26, the NHC started tracking a tropical wave with the potential for development into a tropical cyclone [123] As it moved westward, the NHC noted that the tropical wave was becoming well-defined, [124] designating it Potential Tropical Cyclone Four on August 2 [125] That night, the system developed a closed circulation just off the southern coast of Cuba, causing the NHC to upgrade it into a tropical depression [41] Tropical Depression Four entered the Gulf of Mexico where it further intensified into Tropical Storm Debby later on August 3 [42] In the Gulf of Mexico, it intensified from tropical storm to hurricane status late on August 4, before making landfall in Florida [126] On August 5, Debby made its first landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida [127] On August 8, Debby made a second landfall in South Carolina, approximately 20 miles (32 km) northeast of Charleston [128] Steadily weakening once inland, later that day, Debby weakened into a tropical depression [129] Early the next day, Debby became a post-tropical cyclone [130]\n\n\nHurricane Ernesto\nOn August 8, the NHC noted that an area of low pressure could form in the central or tropical Atlantic [137] Later that day, they began tracking a tropical wave southwest of Cabo Verde [138] Shower activity associated with the wave began increasing two days later, [139] later showing signs of organization on August 11 [140] As a result, later that day, the disturbance developed into a low-pressure area [141] As the system was expected to impact the Leeward Islands, it was designated Potential Tropical Cyclone Five soon after [142] The next day, the system organized enough to become a tropical storm, being named Ernesto [43] Ernesto would intensify as it moved through the Lesser Antilles, impacting the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico [143] Generally favorable environment conditions allowed Ernesto to intensify further, becoming a hurricane on August 14 [44] Although it continued to be disrupted by dry air intrusion, the storm intensified further, peaking as a Category 2 hurricane a day later [45] Following this, Ernesto would weaken due to wind shear before making landfall in Bermuda at 08:30 UTC on August 17 as a Category 1 hurricane [46] After making landfall, Ernesto would then weaken further into a tropical storm due to dry air later that day [144] However, at 21:00 UTC the next day, Ernesto re-intensified into a Category 1 hurricane as environmental conditions began to improve around Ernesto [145] After a brief period of re-intensification throughout August 19, re-strengthening to sustained winds of 90 mph (145 km/h), [146] Ernesto began to weaken once again due to colder sea surface temperatures and environmental conditions becoming unfavorable, as it brushed the coast of Newfoundland [147] As Ernesto continued to quickly move northeastwards during the middle of August 20, Ernesto would become post-tropical as the NHC ceased issuing further advisories on the system [148]\n\n\nHurricane Francine\nOn August 26, the NHC noted that a low-pressure area could form in the Central Tropical Atlantic [156] Two days later, they began tracking a tropical wave producing disorganized showers [157] Initially, showers from the wave were a bit more concentrated along its axis, [158] becoming more organized by August 31 [159] However, an unconducive environment for development caused the wave to become disorganized [160] Several days later, on September 7, the wave crossed into the Bay of Campeche, [161] becoming a low-pressure area the next day [162] Due to the system's imminent threat to land, it was designated Potential Tropical Cyclone Six at 21:00 UTC on September 8 [163] Higher wind gusts in the system were enhanced by a barrier jet near the Sierra Madre Oriental [163] Early the next day, the disturbance organized into Tropical Storm Francine [50] As the system meandered in the gulf, its track trended east due to a high pressure system in Florida [164] Francine's core continued to organize, becoming a hurricane 03:00 UTC September 11 [165] As Francine continued to move northeastwards, steady rapid intensification occurred [166] Despite a continuous increase in wind shear, Francine would strengthen into a Category 2 hurricane just south of Louisiana, achieving peak intensity of 100 mph (155 km/h) [167] At that intensity, Francine made landfall in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana at 22:00 UTC on September 11 [168] Rapid weakening began after the hurricane made landfall, and at 03:00 UTC on September 12, Francine weakened into a tropical storm and then a tropical depression at 06:00 UTC and finally after another three hours remained as a remnant low for one day [169]\n\n\nTropical Storm Gordon\nOn September 7, the NHC noted that a trough of low pressure could interact with a nearby tropical wave and slowly develop [176] Being in a favorable environment for development, [177] on September 11, showers and thunderstorms began showing signs of organization in the disturbance, which had became a tropical wave [178] Later that day, the wave developed a surface circulation, [179] causing it to develop into Tropical Depression Seven [180] The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Gordon at 15:00 UTC on September 13 [181] The center of the system remained to the west of its deep convection, and persistent wind shear prevented Gordon from significantly strengthening Gordon weakened back to a tropical depression on September 15 [182] Gordon's convective structure gradually degraded, and the system degenerated into a trough of low pressure on September 17 [183] The NHC continued to monitor the system for potential redevelopment until September 21, though strong wind shear kept any convection away from the center of circulation as it moved over the open central Atlantic [184]\n\n\nHurricane Helene\nOn September 17, the NHC noted that tropical cyclogenesis could occur somewhere in the northwestern Caribbean Sea in less than a week [185] Several days later, on September 22, they began tracking a broad low-pressure area located in the western Caribbean [186] As it traversed an environment conducive for development, [187] showers and thunderstorms associated with the disturbance began to consolidate [188] Due to the system's imminent threat to land, it was designated Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine at 15:00 UTC on September 23 [189] The system would acquire tropical characteristics over the next twenty-four hours, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Helene at 15:00 UTC on September 24 The system continued strengthening, and by the next day, NHC upgraded the system to a hurricane On September 26, Helene made landfall just east of the mouth of Florida's Aucilla River at peak intensity  [190] Helene quickly weakened as it moved quickly inland before degenerating into a post-tropical cyclone over Tennessee on September 27 The system then stalled over the state before dissipating on September 29.\n\n\nHurricane Isaac\nOn September 25, the NHC began monitoring a non-tropical low located northeast of Bermuda, producing gale-force winds [193] Later that day, the disturbance became better organized, and the low detached from the frontal boundary [194] Having completed its tropical transition, the system was designated Tropical Storm Isaac at 03:00 UTC on September 26, while located about 690 mi (1115 km) east-northeast of Bermuda [56] While moving generally eastward, the storm steadily became better organized, and became a Category 1 hurricane on September 27 [195] Isaac continued to strengthen into the next day, as it turned toward the northeast, intensifying to a Category 2 hurricane [196] This was its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 968 mbar (28.59 inHg), attained about 785 mi (1265 km) west of the Azores [55] Isaac's intensification then leveled off, [197] before steadily weakening back to a tropical storm late on September 29 under the influence of increasingly unfavorable sea surface temperatures, wind shear, and dry air [198] Isaac also began its extra-tropical transition, [199] which it completed on the morning of September 30 [200]\n\n\nTropical Storm Joyce\nOn September 22, a tropical wave moved off the coast of West Africa [203] Initially producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms, the wave tracked through a generally favorable environment for development [204] A broad low-pressure area formed along the wave, [205] producing increasingly convective activity [206] On September 27, midway between the Leeward Islands and Cabo Verde, the disturbance acquired gale-force winds, [207] and developed into Tropical Storm Joyce that same day [208] Joyce continued to organize, reaching its peak intensity with winds of 50 miles per hour (80 km/h) later that day [209] By September 28, Joyce began to weaken as southerly wind shear displaced convection away from its center, [210] weakening to a tropical depression the next day [211] Joyce degenerated into a remnant low by September 30 [212]\n\n\nHurricane Kirk\nOn September 28, the NHC began monitoring a broad area of low pressure producing limited shower activity west of Cabo Verde [213] As showers and thunderstorms associated with the disturbance became better organized, [214] satellite imagery on September 29 revealed that the disturbance's circulation was becoming better defined [215] As a result, later that day, it developed into Tropical Depression Twelve [216] The next day it developed into Tropical Storm Kirk [217] Amidst \"quite conducive\" environmental conditions, Kirk strengthened at a quick pace, with the National Hurricane Center noting a partial eyewall by early on September 30 Around the afternoon of October 1, the NHC reported that Kirk became a hurricane [218] After fluctuating in intensity following that rapid intensification period, Kirk reached Category 4 intensity by late on October 3 [219] The system reached its peak the following morning, with Category 4 winds of 145 mph (230 km/h), far to the east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands [220] Kirk weakened as it moved north into colder waters, before accelerating to the northeast and undergoing extratropical transition, which it completed on the morning of October 7 [221] The extratropical cyclone then passed north of the Azores, before moving towards the west coast of France and western Europe [222]\n\n\nHurricane Leslie\nOn September 29, the NHC began monitoring a tropical wave producing limited shower activity near the coast of West Africa [229] The next day, a broad area of low pressure formed along wave south of the Cabo Verde Islands amid conditions conducive for additional development [230] The system became gradually better organized as a broad closed circulation developed on October 2, resulting in the formation of Tropical Depression Thirteen [57] Late that same day, the system strengthened, becoming Tropical Storm Leslie, while moving slowly to the west within a moderate wind shear environment due to the outflow from Hurricane Kirk to its northwest [231] On October 5, Leslie intensified and became a Category 1 hurricane, before weakening back to a tropical storm on the morning of October 8 [232] [233] Leslie would restrengthen into a hurricane later that night after moving over warmer waters, becoming a Category 2 hurricane early on October 10 At 09:00 UTC the next day, Leslie weakened to a tropical storm as northerly wind shear displaced most of the storm's convective activity to the south of the center, leaving the center exposed [234] Leslie then turned northeastward and accelerated in front of an approaching trough before degenerating into a trough itself on October 12 [235]\n\n\nHurricane Milton\nOn September 26, the NHC began monitoring the Caribbean Sea for possible tropical development [238] Three days later, a broad area of low pressure formed over the western Caribbean, producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms; [239] however, it degenerated into an open trough two days later [240] As this broad trough began interacting with a stationary front and the remains of Tropical Depression Eleven-E in the eastern Pacific, [241] a new low-pressure area developed in the Gulf of Mexico on October 4 [242] Showers and thunderstorms associated with this disturbance became better organized, [243] causing the NHC to upgrade it into Tropical Depression Fourteen the next day [58] Further development happened, and a few hours later, satellite wind data indicated the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Milton [244] Milton was able to rapidly intensify due to being in a very favorable environment, and became a Category 1 hurricane on the afternoon of October 6 Milton continued to strengthen overnight and into the morning, reaching Category 4 status on the morning of October 7, then reaching Category 5 intensity by 16:00 UTC that day [60] Milton continued to strengthen further during the afternoon, reaching winds of 180 mph (285 km/h) at 18:00 UTC the same day [245] The next day, it weakened to a high-end Category 4 hurricane due to an eyewall replacement cycle; however, upon the cycle's completion, it quickly restrengthened back to Category 5 intensity However, the next day, it weakened to a Category 4 hurricane, then further weakening to Category 3 intensity as strong southwesterly wind shear of 35–40 mph (56–65 km/h) overtook the hurricane [246] At 00:30 UTC on October 10, Milton made landfall near Siesta Key, Florida, as a Category 3 hurricane with 120 mph (195 km/h) winds Milton weakened as it moved over land and re-entered the Atlantic as a Category 1 hurricane, merging with a nearby frontal boundary By October 10, it had transitioned into an extratropical low It gradually lost strength, passing near Bermuda on October 11, before dissipating within the frontal zone on October 12 [247]\n\n\nTropical Storm Nadine\nOn October 15, a broad area of low pressure formed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea east of Central America [260] associated with the Central American Gyre [261] The disturbance moved slowly northwestward over the following couple of days, remaining offshore [262] Then, on October 17 and 18, the low gradually became better defined, and the showers and thunderstorms associated with it become better organized [263] [264] Consequently, the system was designed Potential Tropical Cyclone Fifteen on the afternoon of October 18 Tropical Storm Watches were issued at that time, from Belize City north to the Belize–Mexico border, and from there north to Tulum, Quintana Roo [265] The system quickly developed a closed circulation, and was designated as Tropical Storm Nadine early the next day, while about 120 mi (190 km) east of Belize City [266] The storm made landfall near Belize City around 16:00 UTC that same day, at peak intensity, with 60 mph (95 km/h) sustained winds [61]  Eight hours later, the storm weakened to a tropical depression while over northern Guatemala [267] Then, on the morning of October 20, the system degenerated into a remnant low while traversing Southern Mexico [268] Nadine's remnants ultimately entered the Pacific basin, where they facilitated the development of a trough of low pressure in the Gulf of Tehuantepec, [269] which led to the formation of Hurricane Kristy on October 21 [270]\n\n\nHurricane Oscar\nOn October 10, a tropical wave producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms being monitored by the NHC moved off of the west coast of Africa [277] Later that day, a broad low pressure area producing near gale winds formed along the wave [278] After moving over Cape Verde the following day, [279] the disturbance moved westward within an unfavorable environment for development, causing its activity to diminish greatly [280] The disturbance remained disorganized as it passed to the north of Puerto Rico on October 18, though strong convection persisted around an emerging mid-level center of circulation [61] The disturbance developed a closed circulation the next morning, and was designated Tropical Storm Oscar [281] A Hurricane Hunters flight found that Oscar was much stronger than originally estimated, and at 18:00 UTC on October 19, Oscar was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane with sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) [282] At 21:50 UTC on October 20, Oscar made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane at Baracoa, located in the Cuban province of Guantánamo [283]\n\n\nOther system\nOn September 11, the NHC noted an area with the potential of tropical cyclone development off the U.S East Coast [288] A non-tropical area of low pressure formed on September 14 [289] The following day, an Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft found that the system possessed a broad low-level circulation center, and was generating deep convection over and around the center It also found that the system was in the process of separating from its frontal characteristics Due to the increasing likelihood of the system gaining tropical characteristics, and its proximity to coastal South Carolina, the NHC designated the system Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight at 21:00 UTC on September 15 [290] A Tropical Storm Warning was issued at that time, extending from Edisto Beach, South Carolina, to Ocracoke Inlet, North Carolina [291] Schools were closed in preparation for the storm [292] The system did not attain tropical characteristics as it approached northeastern South Carolina the following afternoon, and its sustained winds fell below tropical storm force Consequently, the Tropical Storm Warnings for the Carolinas were discontinued with the final NHC advisory at 21:00 UTC on September 16 [293] The storm brought heavy rain to the Carolinas, especially at Carolina Beach, North Carolina, where rainfall totals reached 20.81 in (529 mm), and caused significant flooding in Brunswick County, North Carolina, [294] [295] where a brief curfew was imposed [296] In Sunny Point, North Carolina, winds gusted to 77 mph (124 km/h) [297] Several coastal roads, such as NC 12, were flooded with high tide [298] One person died after attempting to drive through floodwaters [299] According to Gallagher Re, total losses are estimated to be at $200 million as of October 2024 [74]\n\n\nStorm names\nThe following list of names is being used for named storms that form in the North Atlantic in 2024 [300] This is the same list used in the 2018 season, with the exceptions of Francine and Milton, which replaced Florence and Michael, respectively [301] Both new names were used for the first time this season Names retired, if any, will be announced by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 2025.\n\n\nSeason effects\nThis is a table of all of the storms that have formed in the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 2024 USD.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season was a relatively active season, with 25 named storms forming in the North Atlantic Ocean. The season began on June 1 and ended on November 30.\n\n**Seasonal Forecasts**\n\nSeveral forecasts were issued by national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts before and during the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. These forecasts included weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year.\n\n**Pre-Season Forecasts**\n\nOn December 11, 2023, Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) released its extended range forecast for the 2024 season, predicting an above-average season with 20 named storms, nine hurricanes and four major hurricanes. TSR updated their forecast on May 30, predicting 24 named storms, 12 hurricanes, and 6 major hurricanes with an ACE of 226 units. Colorado State University (CSU) released its forecast on April 4, calling for an extremely active hurricane season, with 23 named storms, 11 hurricanes and five major hurricanes, with an ACE index of 210 units. Météo-France (MFM) issued a prediction of 21 named storms and 11 hurricanes on April 5. TSR updated their prediction on April 8, predicting 23 tropical storms, 11 hurricanes, and five major hurricanes, with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index of 217 units. The University of Arizona (UA) posted their forecast calling for a very active season featuring 21 named storms, 11 hurricanes, 5 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 156 units. The University of Missouri (MU) issued their prediction of 26 named storms, 11 hurricanes, and five major hurricanes on April 12.

The Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) issued their forecast of 20–23 tropical storms, 9–11 hurricanes, and 4–5 major hurricanes on May 6. UKMO published their forecast for the 2024 season, calling for 22 named storms, 12 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 212 units on May 22. NOAA published their hurricane season prediction, forecasting an above-average season of 17–25 named storms, 8–13 hurricanes, and 4–7 major hurricanes on May 25.\n\n**Mid-Season Forecasts**\n\nOn June 11, CSU updated its predictions, continuing to expect an extremely active season, with 23 tropical storms, 11 hurricanes, five major hurricanes, and an ACE of 210. On June 23, UA updated its prediction with 23 named storms, 10 hurricanes, five major hurricanes, and an ACE of 231. TSR updated its predictions on July 5 with 26 tropical storms, 13 hurricanes, and six major hurricanes with an ACE of 240. On July 9, CSU updated its predictions, anticipating an even more active season, with 25 tropical storms, 12 hurricanes, six major hurricanes, and an ACE of 230.\n\n**Seasonal Summary**\n\nThe 2024 Atlantic hurricane season began on June 1 and will end on November 30. As of now, 25 named storms have formed, with 10 of them becoming hurricanes and four strengthening into major hurricanes. Ten systems have made landfall this season.\n\n**Early Activity**\n\nThe 2024 Atlantic hurricane season had its slowest start since 2014. Tropical cyclogenesis in June often occurs over the Gulf of Mexico and northern Caribbean Sea. However, a large stationary heat dome over Central America and Mexico delayed the formation of the first named storm.\n\n**Tropical Storm Alberto**\n\nThe season's first named storm, Tropical Storm Alberto, formed in the western Gulf of Mexico on June 19. Alberto intensified up to landfall, attaining peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 992 mbar (29.29 inHg) by the morning of June 20. Alberto moved ashore at 09:00 UTC that day near Tampico, Mexico, and rapidly weakened over land, dissipating just nine hours later.\n\n**Hurricane Beryl**\n\nOn June 25, the NHC began monitoring a tropical wave producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms just south of Cabo Verde. The wave began showing signs of organization on June 26, with modest thunderstorm activity, curved bands, and some spin development. The disturbance further organized, becoming Tropical Depression Two over the central tropical Atlantic on June 28. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Beryl six hours after formation. Beryl intensified into a hurricane on June 29, peaking as a Category 4 hurricane on July 2. Beryl made landfall in Carriacou, Grenada, with sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) on July 2. Beryl continued to intensify into a Category 5 hurricane on July 3, peaking with winds of 165 mph (270 km/h). Beryl passed south of Isla Beata, Dominican Republic, weakening to Category 4 strength due to wind shear.\n\n**Tropical Storm Chris**\n\nOn June 24, the NHC began monitoring a tropical wave east-southeast of the Windward Islands producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms. The disturbance moved generally westward across the Caribbean for several days, traversing the Yucatán Peninsula and emerging in the Bay of Campeche early on June 30. There, an area of low pressure formed, which quickly became better organized. Tropical Depression Three formed later that day, and strengthened into Tropical Storm Chris six hours later. Shortly thereafter, the system made landfall in the municipality of Vega de Alatorre, Veracruz, at peak intensity. Chris rapidly weakened over the rough terrain of Mexico, dissipating early on July 1.\n\n**Hurricane Debby**\n\nOn July 26, the NHC started tracking a tropical wave with the potential for development into a tropical cyclone. As it moved westward, the NHC noted that the tropical wave was becoming well-defined, designating it Potential Tropical Cyclone Four on August 2. That night, the system developed a closed circulation just off the southern coast of Cuba, causing the NHC to upgrade it into a tropical depression. Tropical Depression Four entered the Gulf of Mexico, where it further intensified into Tropical Storm Debby on August 3. In the Gulf of Mexico, it intensified from tropical storm to hurricane status late on August 4, before making landfall in Florida on August 5. Debby made its first landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida, and its second landfall in South Carolina on August 8. Steadily weakening once inland, Debby weakened into a tropical depression on August 8. Early the next day, Debby became a post-tropical cyclone.\n\n**Hurricane Ernesto**\n\nOn August 8, the NHC noted that an area of low pressure could form in the central or tropical Atlantic. Later that day, they began tracking a tropical wave southwest of Cabo Verde. Shower activity associated with the wave began increasing two days later, showing signs of organization on August 11. As a result, the disturbance developed into a low-pressure area on August 11. As the system was expected to impact the Leeward Islands, it was designated Potential Tropical Cyclone Five soon after. The next day, the system organized enough to become a tropical storm, being named Ernesto. Ernesto intensified as it moved through the Lesser Antilles, impacting the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Generally favorable environment conditions allowed Ernesto to intensify further, becoming a hurricane on August 14. Although it continued to be disrupted by dry air intrusion, the storm intensified further, peaking as a Category 2 hurricane a day later. Following this, Ernesto weakened due to wind shear before making landfall in Bermuda at 08:30 UTC on August 17 as a Category 1 hurricane. After making landfall, Ernesto re-intensified into a Category 1 hurricane as environmental conditions began to improve around Ernesto. However, at 21:00 UTC the next day, Ernesto re-attained Category 1 strength. After a brief period of re-intensification throughout August 19, Ernesto began to weaken once again due to colder sea surface temperatures and environmental conditions becoming unfavorable, as it brushed the coast of Newfoundland. As Ernesto continued to quickly move northeastwards during the middle of August 20, Ernesto would become post-tropical as the NHC ceased issuing further advisories on the system.\n\n**Hurricane Francine**\n\nOn August 26, the NHC noted that a low-pressure area could form in the central Tropical Atlantic. Two days later, they began tracking a tropical wave producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Initially, showers from the wave were a bit more concentrated along its axis, becoming more organized by August 31. However, an unconducive environment for development caused the wave to become disorganized. Several days later, on September 7, the wave crossed into the Bay of Campeche, becoming a low-pressure area the next day. Due to the system's imminent threat to land, it was designated Potential Tropical Cyclone Six at 21:00 UTC on September 8. Higher wind gusts in the system were enhanced by a barrier jet near the Sierra Madre Oriental. Early the next day, the disturbance organized into Tropical Storm Francine. As the system meandered in the gulf, its track trended east due to a high pressure system in Florida. Francine's core continued to organize, becoming a hurricane 03:00 UTC September 11. As Francine continued to move northeastwards, steady rapid intensification occurred. Despite a continuous increase in wind shear, Francine would strengthen into a Category 2 hurricane just south of Louisiana, achieving peak intensity of 100 mph (155 km/h). At that intensity, Francine made landfall in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana at 22:00 UTC on September 11. Rapid weakening began after the hurricane made landfall, and at 03:00 UTC on September 12, Francine weakened into a tropical storm and then a tropical depression at 06:00 UTC and finally remained as a remnant low for one day.\n\n**Tropical Storm Gordon**\n\nOn September 7, the NHC noted that a trough of low pressure could interact with a nearby tropical wave and slowly develop. Being in a favorable environment for development, showers and thunderstorms began showing signs of organization in the disturbance on September 11. Later that day, the wave developed a surface circulation, causing it to develop into Tropical Depression Seven. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Gordon at 15:00 UTC on September 13. The center of the system remained to the west of its deep convection, and persistent wind shear prevented Gordon from significantly strengthening. Gordon weakened back to a tropical depression on September 15. Gordon's convective structure gradually degraded, and the system degenerated into a trough of low pressure on September 17. The NHC continued to monitor the system for potential redevelopment until September 21, though strong wind shear kept any convection away from the center of circulation as it moved over the open central Atlantic.\n\n**Hurricane Helene**\n\nOn September 17, the NHC noted that tropical cyclogenesis could occur somewhere in the northwestern Caribbean Sea in less than a week. Several days later, a broad area of low pressure formed over the western Caribbean, producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms. The disturbance moved slowly northwestward over the following couple of days, remaining offshore. Then, on September 23, the low gradually became better defined, and the showers and thunderstorms associated with it become better organized. Consequently, the system was designated Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine at 15:00 UTC on September 23. Helene continued strengthening, and by the next day, NHC upgraded the system to a hurricane. On September 26, Helene made landfall just east of the mouth of Florida's Aucilla River at peak intensity. Helene quickly weakened as it moved quickly inland before degenerating into a post-tropical cyclone over Tennessee on September 27. The system then stalled over the state before dissipating on September 29.\n\n**Hurricane Isaac**\n\nOn September 25, the NHC began monitoring a non-tropical low located northeast of Bermuda, producing gale-force winds. Later that day, the disturbance became better organized, and the low detached from the frontal boundary. Having completed its tropical transition, the system was designated Tropical Storm Isaac at 03:00 UTC on September 26, while located about 690 mi (1115 km) east-northeast of Bermuda. While moving generally eastward, the storm steadily became better organized, becoming a Category 1 hurricane on September 27. Isaac continued to strengthen into a Category 2 hurricane on September 28, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 968 mbar (28.59 inHg). Isaac's intensification then leveled off, before steadily weakening back to a tropical storm late on September 29 under the influence of increasingly unfavorable sea surface temperatures, wind shear, and dry air. Isaac also began its extra-tropical transition, which it completed on the morning of September 30. The storm then rapidly weakened, passing north of the Azores before moving towards the west coast of France and western Europe.\n\n**Tropical Storm Joyce**\n\nOn September 22, a tropical wave moved off the coast of West Africa. Initially producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms, the wave tracked through a generally favorable environment for development. A broad low-pressure area formed along the wave, producing increasingly convective activity. On September 27, midway between the Leeward Islands and Cabo Verde, the disturbance acquired gale-force winds, and developed into Tropical Storm Joyce. Joyce continued to organize, reaching its peak intensity with winds of 50 miles per hour (80 km/h) later that day. By September 28, Joyce began to weaken as southerly wind shear displaced convection away from its center, weakening to a tropical depression the next day. Joyce degenerated into a remnant low by September 30.\n\n**Hurricane Kirk**\n\nOn September 28, the NHC began monitoring a broad area of low pressure producing limited shower activity west of Cabo Verde. As showers and thunderstorms associated with the disturbance became better organized, satellite imagery on September 29 revealed that the disturbance's circulation was becoming better defined. As a result, later that day, it developed into Tropical Depression Twelve. The next day it developed into Tropical Storm Kirk. Amidst \"quite conducive\" environmental conditions, Kirk strengthened at a quick pace, with the National Hurricane Center noting a partial eyewall by early on October 1. Around the afternoon of October 1, the NHC reported that Kirk became a hurricane. After fluctuating in intensity following that rapid intensification period, Kirk reached Category 4 intensity by late on October 3. The system reached its peak the following morning, with Category 4 winds of 145 mph (230 km/h), far to the east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands. Kirk weakened as it moved north into colder waters, before accelerating to the northeast and undergoing extratropical transition, which it completed on the morning of October 7. The extratropical cyclone then passed north of the Azores, before moving towards the west coast of France and western Europe.\n\n**Hurricane Leslie**\n\nOn September 29, the NHC began monitoring a tropical wave producing limited shower activity near the coast of West Africa. The next day, a broad area of low pressure formed along the wave south of the Cabo Verde Islands amid conditions conducive for additional development. The system became gradually better organized as a broad closed circulation developed on October 2, resulting in the formation of Tropical Depression Thirteen. Late that same day, the system strengthened, becoming Tropical Storm Leslie, while moving slowly to the west within a moderate wind shear environment due to the outflow from Hurricane Kirk to its northwest. On October 5, Leslie intensified and became a Category 1 hurricane, before weakening back to a tropical storm on the morning of October 8. Leslie would restrengthen into a hurricane later that night after moving over warmer waters, becoming a Category 2 hurricane early on October 10. At 09:00 UTC the next day, Leslie weakened to a tropical storm as northerly wind shear displaced most of the storm's convective activity to the south of the center, leaving the center exposed. Leslie then turned northeastward and accelerated in front of an approaching trough before degenerating into a trough itself on October 12.\n\n**Hurricane Milton**\n\nOn September 26, the NHC began monitoring the Caribbean Sea for possible tropical development. Three days later, a broad area of low pressure formed over the western Caribbean, producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms. However, it degenerated into an open trough two days later. As this broad trough began interacting with a stationary front and the remains of Tropical Depression Eleven-E in the eastern Pacific, a new low-pressure area developed in the Gulf of Mexico on October 4. Showers and thunderstorms associated with this disturbance became better organized, causing the NHC to upgrade it into Tropical Depression Fourteen the next day. Further development happened, and a few hours later, satellite wind data indicated the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Milton. Milton was able to rapidly intensify due to being in a very favorable environment, and became a Category 1 hurricane on the afternoon of October 6. Milton continued to strengthen overnight and into the morning, reaching Category 4 status on the morning of October 7, then reaching Category 5 intensity by 16:00 UTC that day. Milton continued to strengthen further during the afternoon, reaching winds of 180 mph (285 km/h) at 18:00 UTC the same day. The next day, it weakened to a high-end Category 4 hurricane due to an eyewall replacement cycle; however, upon the cycle's completion, it quickly restrengthened back to Category 5 intensity. However, the next day, it weakened to a Category 4 hurricane, then further weakening to Category 3 intensity as strong southwesterly wind shear of 35–40 mph (56–65 km/h) overtook the hurricane. At 00:30 UTC on October 10, Milton made landfall near Siesta Key, Florida, as a Category 3 hurricane with 120 mph (195 km/h) winds. Milton weakened as it moved over land and re-entered the Atlantic as a Category 1 hurricane, merging with a nearby frontal boundary. By October 10, it had transitioned into an extratropical low. It gradually lost strength, passing near Bermuda on October 11, before dissipating within the frontal zone on October 12.\n\n**Tropical Storm Nadine**\n\nOn October 15, a broad area of low pressure formed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea east of Central America associated with the Central American Gyre. The disturbance moved slowly northwestward over the following couple of days, remaining offshore. Then, on October 17 and 18, the low gradually became better defined, and the showers and thunderstorms associated with it become better organized. Consequently, the system was designated Potential Tropical Cyclone Fifteen on the afternoon of October 18. Tropical Storm Watches were issued at that time, from Belize City north to the Belize–Mexico border, and from there north to Tulum, Quintana Roo. The system quickly developed a closed circulation, and", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2024_Atlantic_hurricane_season\" following this outline:\n\n\nSeasonal forecasts\nIn advance of, and during, each hurricane season, several forecasts of hurricane activity are issued by national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts These include forecasters from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Climate Prediction Center, Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), the United Kingdom's Met Office (UKMO), and Colorado State University (CSU) The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year [22]\n\n\nPre-season forecasts\nOn December 11, 2023, Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) released its extended range forecast for the 2024 season, predicting an above-average season with 20 named storms, nine hurricanes and four major hurricanes [nb 1] [3] They took into account ongoing warm sea-surface temperatures (SST) throughout most of the basin, specifically in the Main Development Region and in the Caribbean Sea on top of the 2023–2024 El Niño event which was predicted to weaken to a neutral phase by August 2024 [3] TSR updated their forecast on May 30, predicting 24 named storms, 12 hurricanes, and 6 major hurricanes with an ACE of 226 units [14] On April 4, 2024, Colorado State University (CSU) released its forecast, calling for an extremely active hurricane season, with 23 named storms, 11 hurricanes and five major hurricanes, with an ACE index of 210 units, citing the extremely warm Atlantic sea surface temperatures and the development of a La Niña by the summer [4] On April 5, Météo-France (MFM) issued a prediction of 21 named storms and 11 hurricanes They cited warm sea surface temperatures, wind patterns, and humidity [5] On April 8, TSR updated their prediction, predicting 23 tropical storms, 11 hurricanes, and five major hurricanes, with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index of 217 units They predicted that moderate La Niña conditions would occur in the summer and persist into fall and above average sea surface temperatures would also persist into summer [6] On the same day, the University of Arizona (UA) posted their forecast calling for a very active season featuring 21 named storms, 11 hurricanes, 5 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 156 units [7] On April 12, University of Missouri (MU) issued their prediction of 26 named storms, 11 hurricanes, and five major hurricanes [8] On April 16, NCSU issued their prediction of 15–20 named storms, 10–12 hurricanes, and 3–4 major hurricanes [9] On April 24, the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) issued their prediction of a record-breaking season, predicting an unprecedented 33 (±6) named storms They cited expected moderate La Niña conditions and record-warm sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic tied to large-scale warming [10] On May 6, the Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) issued their forecast of 20–23 tropical storms, 9–11 hurricanes, and 4–5 major hurricanes [11] On May 22, UKMO published their forecast for the 2024 season, calling for 22 named storms, 12 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 212 units [12] One day later, NOAA published their hurricane season prediction, forecasting an above-average season of 17–25 named storms, 8–13 hurricanes, and 4–7 major hurricanes with an 85% chance of being an above-average season [13] TSR updated their predictions on May 30 with 24 tropical storms, 12 hurricanes, and 6 major hurricanes with an ACE of 226 [14]\n\n\nMid-season forecasts\nOn June 11, CSU also updated its predictions, continuing to expect an extremely active season, with 23 tropical storms, 11 hurricanes, five major hurricanes, and an ACE of 210 [15] On June 23, UA updated its prediction with 23 named storms, 10 hurricanes, five major hurricanes, and an ACE of 231 [16] TSR updated its predictions on July 5 with 26 tropical storms, 13 hurricanes, and six major hurricanes with an ACE of

its prediction of the total number of named storms slightly, while still anticipating a highly active season [21]\n\n\nSeasonal summary\nOfficially, the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season began on June 1, and will end on November 30 [25] So far, fifteen tropical cyclones have formed, and all of them became named storms Ten of the storms became hurricanes, of which four strengthened into major hurricanes Altogether, ten systems have made landfall this season \n\n\nBackground\nOfficially, the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season began on June 1, and will end on November 30 [25] So far, fifteen tropical cyclones have formed, and all of them became named storms Ten of the storms became hurricanes, of which four strengthened into major hurricanes Altogether, ten systems have made landfall this season \n\n\nEarly activity\nThough the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, it had its slowest start since 2014 This was due to a large stationary heat dome over Central America and Mexico, as tropical cyclogenesis in June often occurs over the Gulf of Mexico and northern Caribbean Sea [27] The season's first named storm, Tropical Storm Alberto, formed in the western Gulf of Mexico on June 19, [nb 2] [29] then proceeded to make landfall on the northeastern coast of Mexico the following day [30] Next came Hurricane Beryl, the earliest-forming Category 4 and Category 5 Atlantic hurricane on record in a season and the strongest June and July hurricane on record in the basin After forming on June 28 in the MDR, the storm rapidly intensified as it approached the Windward Islands, [31] [32] [33] peaking as a Category 5 hurricane early on July 2 [34] Short-lived Tropical Storm Chris developed in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico on June 30, [35] quickly moving ashore in Mexico the following morning [36] Beryl continued on, impacting Jamaica and landfalling on the Yucatán Peninsula and Texas [37] [38] [39] After Beryl dissipated on July 11, the Atlantic basin would fall under a period of inactivity due to the Saharan air layer, which suppresses tropical activity, persisting over the open Atlantic alongside dry air typically occurring during this period of the season [40]\n\n\nPeak to late season\nDespite the unseasonably warm temperatures in the North Atlantic, the equatorial Atlantic cooled rapidly into an \"Atlantic Niña\" due to upwelling caused by shifts in the trade winds and the Atlantic zonal mode The effects of an Atlantic Niña is not certain but it is contrary to the assumptions that the NOAA used in their forecast of seasonal activity [47] CSU associated the quietness of the Atlantic during the month of August and the period after Ernesto dissipated–despite predictions of an extremely active peak period–to tropical waves forming too far north, warm upper-level winds causing destabilization, wind shear in the East Atlantic, and factors associated with the Madden–Julian oscillation [48]\n\n\nSystems\nA Central American gyre resulted in the formation of convection over the Gulf of Tehuantepec on June 15 As the convective activity progressed northward over southeastern Mexico and exited into the Bay of Campeche, an area of low pressure gradually developed on June 17 about 105 miles (169 km) northwest of Ciudad del Carmen, Mexico The system gradually became better organized, though still remained rather broad, developing into Tropical Storm Alberto by 12:00 UTC on June 19 Under the influence of light vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, Alberto intensified up to landfall, attaining peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 992 mbar (29.29 inHg) by the morning of June 20 Alberto moved ashore at 09:00 UTC that day near Tampico, Mexico, and rapidly weakened over land, dissipating just nine hours later [64]\n\n\nTropical Storm Alberto\nA Central American gyre resulted in the formation of convection over the Gulf of Tehuantepec on June 15 As the convective

June 20 Alberto moved ashore at 09:00 UTC that day near Tampico, Mexico, and rapidly weakened over land, dissipating just nine hours later [64]\n\n\nHurricane Beryl\nOn June 25, the NHC began monitoring a tropical wave producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms just south of Cabo Verde [75] The following day, the wave began showing signs of organization, with modest thunderstorm activity, curved bands, and some spin development [76] The disturbance further organized, becoming Tropical Depression Two over the central tropical Atlantic on June 28 [77] Located south of a strong subtropical ridge, the depression moved generally westward through an unusually favorable environment for the time of year with warm sea surface temperatures (SST) and minimal wind shear, consequently beginning a period of rapid intensification The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Beryl six hours after formation, [78] and the thunderstorms quickly organized into a central dense overcast, with a symmetric cloud pattern surrounded by rainbands [79] Late on June 29, Beryl intensified into a hurricane The inner core of the thunderstorms organized into an eye, [80] which became clear and symmetrical Observations from the Hurricane Hunters indicated that Beryl became a major hurricane on June 30 [81] The hurricane strengthened further into a Category 4 hurricane Beryl maintained an initial peak intensity with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) [82] Beryl then underwent an eyewall replacement cycle and briefly weakened to a Category 3 hurricane early on July 1, [83] but regained Category 4 strength six hours later once the cycle was completed [84] At 15:10 UTC the same day, Beryl made landfall in Carriacou, Grenada, with sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) [85] At 03:00 UTC the next day, Beryl further intensified into a Category 5 hurricane, [34] peaking a few hours later with winds of 165 mph (270 km/h), while moving to the west-northwest at about 20 mph (35 km/h) [86] Later that same day, Beryl passed south of Isla Beata, Dominican Republic, where it weakened to Category 4 strength [87] as a result of wind shear [88]\n\n\nTropical Storm Chris\nOn June 24, the NHC began monitoring a tropical wave east-southeast of the Windward Islands producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms [115] The disturbance moved generally westward across the Caribbean for several days, [116] before traversing the Yucatán Peninsula and emerging in the Bay of Campeche early on June 30 [117] There, an area of low pressure formed, which quickly became better organized Tropical Depression Three formed later that day, [118] and strengthened into Tropical Storm Chris six hours later [35] Shortly thereafter, the system made landfall in the municipality of Vega de Alatorre, Veracruz, at peak intensity [36] Chris rapidly weakened over the rough terrain of Mexico, dissipating early on July 1 [119]\n\n\nHurricane Debby\nOn July 26, the NHC started tracking a tropical wave with the potential for development into a tropical cyclone [123] As it moved westward, the NHC noted that the tropical wave was becoming well-defined, [124] designating it Potential Tropical Cyclone Four on August 2 [125] That night, the system developed a closed circulation just off the southern coast of Cuba, causing the NHC to upgrade it into a tropical depression [41] Tropical Depression Four entered the Gulf of Mexico where it further intensified into Tropical Storm Debby later on August 3 [42] In the Gulf of Mexico, it intensified from tropical storm to hurricane status late on August 4, before making landfall in Florida [126] On August 5, Debby made its first landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida [127] On August 8, Debby made a second landfall in South Carolina, approximately 20 miles (32 km) northeast of Charleston [128] Steadily weakening once inland, later that day, Debby weakened into a tropical depression [129] Early the next day, Debby became a post-tropical cyclone [130]\n\n\nHurricane Ernesto\nOn August 8, the NHC noted that an area of low pressure could form in the central or tropical Atlantic [137] Later that day, they began tracking a tropical wave southwest of Cabo Verde [138] Shower activity associated with the wave began increasing two days later, [139] later showing signs of organization on August 11 [140] As a result, later that day, the disturbance developed into a low-pressure area [141] As the system was expected to impact the Leeward Islands, it was designated Potential Tropical Cyclone Five soon after [142] The next day, the system organized enough to become a tropical storm, being named Ernesto [43] Ernesto would intensify as it moved through the Lesser Antilles, impacting the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico [143] Generally favorable environment conditions allowed Ernesto to intensify further, becoming a hurricane on August 14 [44] Although it continued to be disrupted by dry air intrusion, the storm intensified further, peaking as a Category 2 hurricane a day later [45] Following this, Ernesto would weaken due to wind shear before making landfall in Bermuda at 08:30 UTC on August 17 as a Category 1 hurricane [46] After making landfall, Ernesto would then weaken further into a tropical storm due to dry air later that day [144] However, at 21:00 UTC the next day, Ernesto re-intensified into a Category 1 hurricane as environmental conditions began to improve around Ernesto [145] After a brief period of re-intensification throughout August 19, re-strengthening to sustained winds of 90 mph (145 km/h), [146] Ernesto began to weaken once again due to colder sea surface temperatures and environmental conditions becoming unfavorable, as it brushed the coast of Newfoundland [147] As Ernesto continued to quickly move northeastwards during the middle of August 20, Ernesto would become post-tropical as the NHC ceased issuing further advisories on the system [148]\n\n\nHurricane Francine\nOn August 26, the NHC noted that a low-pressure area could form in the Central Tropical Atlantic [156] Two days later, they began tracking a tropical wave producing disorganized showers [157] Initially, showers from the wave were a bit more concentrated along its axis, [158] becoming more organized by August 31 [159] However, an unconducive environment for development caused the wave to become disorganized [160] Several days later, on September 7, the wave crossed into the Bay of Campeche, [161] becoming a low-pressure area the next day [162] Due to the system's imminent threat to land, it was designated Potential Tropical Cyclone Six at 21:00 UTC on September 8 [163] Higher wind gusts in the system were enhanced by a barrier jet near the Sierra Madre Oriental [163] Early the next day, the disturbance organized into Tropical Storm Francine [50] As the system meandered in the gulf, its track trended east due to a high pressure system in Florida [164] Francine's core continued to organize, becoming a hurricane 03:00 UTC September 11 [165] As Francine continued to move northeastwards, steady rapid intensification occurred [166] Despite a continuous increase in wind shear, Francine would strengthen into a Category 2 hurricane just south of Louisiana, achieving peak intensity of 100 mph (155 km/h) [167] At that intensity, Francine made landfall in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana at 22:00 UTC on September 11 [168] Rapid weakening began after the hurricane made landfall, and at 03:00 UTC on September 12, Francine weakened into a tropical storm and then a tropical depression at 06:00 UTC and finally after another three hours remained as a remnant low for one day [169]\n\n\nTropical Storm Gordon\nOn September 7, the NHC noted that a trough of low pressure could interact with a nearby tropical wave and slowly develop [176] Being in a favorable environment for development, [177] on September 11, showers and thunderstorms began showing signs of organization in the disturbance, which had became a tropical wave [178] Later that day, the wave developed a surface circulation, [179] causing it to develop into Tropical Depression Seven [180] The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Gordon at 15:00 UTC on September 13 [181] The center of the system remained to the west of its deep convection, and persistent wind shear prevented Gordon from significantly strengthening Gordon weakened back to a tropical depression on September 15 [182] Gordon's convective structure gradually degraded, and the system degenerated into a trough of low pressure on September 17 [183] The NHC continued to monitor the system for potential redevelopment until September 21, though strong wind shear kept any convection away from the center of circulation as it moved over the open central Atlantic [184]\n\n\nHurricane Helene\nOn September 17, the NHC noted that tropical cyclogenesis could occur somewhere in the northwestern Caribbean Sea in less than a week [185] Several days later, on September 22, they began tracking a broad low-pressure area located in the western Caribbean [186] As it traversed an environment conducive for development, [187] showers and thunderstorms associated with the disturbance began to consolidate [188] Due to the system's imminent threat to land, it was designated Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine at 15:00 UTC on September 23 [189] The system would acquire tropical characteristics over the next twenty-four hours, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Helene at 15:00 UTC on September 24 The system continued strengthening, and by the next day, NHC upgraded the system to a hurricane On September 26, Helene made landfall just east of the mouth of Florida's Aucilla River at peak intensity  [190] Helene quickly weakened as it moved quickly inland before degenerating into a post-tropical cyclone over Tennessee on September 27 The system then stalled over the state before dissipating on September 29.\n\n\nHurricane Isaac\nOn September 25, the NHC began monitoring a non-tropical low located northeast of Bermuda, producing gale-force winds [193] Later that day, the disturbance became better organized, and the low detached from the frontal boundary [194] Having completed its tropical transition, the system was designated Tropical Storm Isaac at 03:00 UTC on September 26, while located about 690 mi (1115 km) east-northeast of Bermuda [56] While moving generally eastward, the storm steadily became better organized, and became a Category 1 hurricane on September 27 [195] Isaac continued to strengthen into the next day, as it turned toward the northeast, intensifying to a Category 2 hurricane [196] This was its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 968 mbar (28.59 inHg), attained about 785 mi (1265 km) west of the Azores [55] Isaac's intensification then leveled off, [197] before steadily weakening back to a tropical storm late on September 29 under the influence of increasingly unfavorable sea surface temperatures, wind shear, and dry air [198] Isaac also began its extra-tropical transition, [199] which it completed on the morning of September 30 [200]\n\n\nTropical Storm Joyce\nOn September 22, a tropical wave moved off the coast of West Africa [203] Initially producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms, the wave tracked through a generally favorable environment for development [204] A broad low-pressure area formed along the wave, [205] producing increasingly convective activity [206] On September 27, midway between the Leeward Islands and Cabo Verde, the disturbance acquired gale-force winds, [207] and developed into Tropical Storm Joyce that same day [208] Joyce continued to organize, reaching its peak intensity with winds of 50 miles per hour (80 km/h) later that day [209] By September 28, Joyce began to weaken as southerly wind shear displaced convection away from its center, [210] weakening to a tropical depression the next day [211] Joyce degenerated into a remnant low by September 30 [212]\n\n\nHurricane Kirk\nOn September 28, the NHC began monitoring a broad area of low pressure producing limited shower activity west of Cabo Verde [213] As showers and thunderstorms associated with the disturbance became better organized, [214] satellite imagery on September 29 revealed that the disturbance's circulation was becoming better defined [215] As a result, later that day, it developed into Tropical Depression Twelve [216] The next day it developed into Tropical Storm Kirk [217] Amidst \"quite conducive\" environmental conditions, Kirk strengthened at a quick pace, with the National Hurricane Center noting a partial eyewall by early on September 30 Around the afternoon of October 1, the NHC reported that Kirk became a hurricane [218] After fluctuating in intensity following that rapid intensification period, Kirk reached Category 4 intensity by late on October 3 [219] The system reached its peak the following morning, with Category 4 winds of 145 mph (230 km/h), far to the east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands [220] Kirk weakened as it moved north into colder waters, before accelerating to the northeast and undergoing extratropical transition, which it completed on the morning of October 7 [221] The extratropical cyclone then passed north of the Azores, before moving towards the west coast of France and western Europe [222]\n\n\nHurricane Leslie\nOn September 29, the NHC began monitoring a tropical wave producing limited shower activity near the coast of West Africa [229] The next day, a broad area of low pressure formed along wave south of the Cabo Verde Islands amid conditions conducive for additional development [230] The system became gradually better organized as a broad closed circulation developed on October 2, resulting in the formation of Tropical Depression Thirteen [57] Late that same day, the system strengthened, becoming Tropical Storm Leslie, while moving slowly to the west within a moderate wind shear environment due to the outflow from Hurricane Kirk to its northwest [231] On October 5, Leslie intensified and became a Category 1 hurricane, before weakening back to a tropical storm on the morning of October 8 [232] [233] Leslie would restrengthen into a hurricane later that night after moving over warmer waters, becoming a Category 2 hurricane early on October 10 At 09:00 UTC the next day, Leslie weakened to a tropical storm as northerly wind shear displaced most of the storm's convective activity to the south of the center, leaving the center exposed [234] Leslie then turned northeastward and accelerated in front of an approaching trough before degenerating into a trough itself on October 12 [235]\n\n\nHurricane Milton\nOn September 26, the NHC began monitoring the Caribbean Sea for possible tropical development [238] Three days later, a broad area of low pressure formed over the western Caribbean, producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms; [239] however, it degenerated into an open trough two days later [240] As this broad trough began interacting with a stationary front and the remains of Tropical Depression Eleven-E in the eastern Pacific, [241] a new low-pressure area developed in the Gulf of Mexico on October 4 [242] Showers and thunderstorms associated with this disturbance became better organized, [243] causing the NHC to upgrade it into Tropical Depression Fourteen the next day [58] Further development happened, and a few hours later, satellite wind data indicated the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Milton [244] Milton was able to rapidly intensify due to being in a very favorable environment, and became a Category 1 hurricane on the afternoon of October 6 Milton continued to strengthen overnight and into the morning, reaching Category 4 status on the morning of October 7, then reaching Category 5 intensity by 16:00 UTC that day [60] Milton continued to strengthen further during the afternoon, reaching winds of 180 mph (285 km/h) at 18:00 UTC the same day [245] The next day, it weakened to a high-end Category 4 hurricane due to an eyewall replacement cycle; however, upon the cycle's completion, it quickly restrengthened back to Category 5 intensity However, the next day, it weakened to a Category 4 hurricane, then further weakening to Category 3 intensity as strong southwesterly wind shear of 35–40 mph (56–65 km/h) overtook the hurricane [246] At 00:30 UTC on October 10, Milton made landfall near Siesta Key, Florida, as a Category 3 hurricane with 120 mph (195 km/h) winds Milton weakened as it moved over land and re-entered the Atlantic as a Category 1 hurricane, merging with a nearby frontal boundary By October 10, it had transitioned into an extratropical low It gradually lost strength, passing near Bermuda on October 11, before dissipating within the frontal zone on October 12 [247]\n\n\nTropical Storm Nadine\nOn October 15, a broad area of low pressure formed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea east of Central America [260] associated with the Central American Gyre [261] The disturbance moved slowly northwestward over the following couple of days, remaining offshore [262] Then, on October 17 and 18, the low gradually became better defined, and the showers and thunderstorms associated with it become better organized [263] [264] Consequently, the system was designed Potential Tropical Cyclone Fifteen on the afternoon of October 18 Tropical Storm Watches were issued at that time, from Belize City north to the Belize–Mexico border, and from there north to Tulum, Quintana Roo [265] The system quickly developed a closed circulation, and was designated as Tropical Storm Nadine early the next day, while about 120 mi (190 km) east of Belize City [266] The storm made landfall near Belize City around 16:00 UTC that same day, at peak intensity, with 60 mph (95 km/h) sustained winds [61]  Eight hours later, the storm weakened to a tropical depression while over northern Guatemala [267] Then, on the morning of October 20, the system degenerated into a remnant low while traversing Southern Mexico [268] Nadine's remnants ultimately entered the Pacific basin, where they facilitated the development of a trough of low pressure in the Gulf of Tehuantepec, [269] which led to the formation of Hurricane Kristy on October 21 [270]\n\n\nHurricane Oscar\nOn October 10, a tropical wave producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms being monitored by the NHC moved off of the west coast of Africa [277] Later that day, a broad low pressure area producing near gale winds formed along the wave [278] After moving over Cape Verde the following day, [279] the disturbance moved westward within an unfavorable environment for development, causing its activity to diminish greatly [280] The disturbance remained disorganized as it passed to the north of Puerto Rico on October 18, though strong convection persisted around an emerging mid-level center of circulation [61] The disturbance developed a closed circulation the next morning, and was designated Tropical Storm Oscar [281] A Hurricane Hunters flight found that Oscar was much stronger than originally estimated, and at 18:00 UTC on October 19, Oscar was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane with sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) [282] At 21:50 UTC on October 20, Oscar made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane at Baracoa, located in the Cuban province of Guantánamo [283]\n\n\nOther system\nOn September 11, the NHC noted an area with the potential of tropical cyclone development off the U.S East Coast [288] A non-tropical area of low pressure formed on September 14 [289] The following day, an Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft found that the system possessed a broad low-level circulation center, and was generating deep convection over and around the center It also found that the system was in the process of separating from its frontal characteristics Due to the increasing likelihood of the system gaining tropical characteristics, and its proximity to coastal South Carolina, the NHC designated the system Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight at 21:00 UTC on September 15 [290] A Tropical Storm Warning was issued at that time, extending from Edisto Beach, South Carolina, to Ocracoke Inlet, North Carolina [291] Schools were closed in preparation for the storm [292] The system did not attain tropical characteristics as it approached northeastern South Carolina the following afternoon, and its sustained winds fell below tropical storm force Consequently, the Tropical Storm Warnings for the Carolinas were discontinued with the final NHC advisory at 21:00 UTC on September 16 [293] The storm brought heavy rain to the Carolinas, especially at Carolina Beach, North Carolina, where rainfall totals reached 20.81 in (529 mm), and caused significant flooding in Brunswick County, North Carolina, [294] [295] where a brief curfew was imposed [296] In Sunny Point, North Carolina, winds gusted to 77 mph (124 km/h) [297] Several coastal roads, such as NC 12, were flooded with high tide [298] One person died after attempting to drive through floodwaters [299] According to Gallagher Re, total losses are estimated to be at $200 million as of October 2024 [74]\n\n\nStorm names\nThe following list of names is being used for named storms that form in the North Atlantic in 2024 [300] This is the same list used in the 2018 season, with the exceptions of Francine and Milton, which replaced Florence and Michael, respectively [301] Both new names were used for the first time this season Names retired, if any, will be announced by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 2025.\n\n\nSeason effects\nThis is a table of all of the storms that have formed in the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 2024 USD.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal

one of his top-selling liquor brands, either McDowell's No.1 or Royal Challenge with the team [142] The latter was chosen, hence the name.\n\n\nLogo\nThe logo initially consisted of the RC emblem in yellow on a circular red base with the black text \"Royal Challengers Bangalore\" in standard format surrounding the circular logo The RC crown emblem with the roaring lion placed on the top of the logo was derived from the original Royal Challenge logo No significant changes took place in the design of the logo except for the replacement of colour yellow with gold from 2009 This logo also had a dotted white circle around the RC emblem The team also uses an alternate logo for the Game for Green matches where the green plants surround the logo and the text Game for Green is placed below the logo The logo was redesigned in 2016 with the inclusion of black as a secondary colour The lion emblem in the crest was enlarged and the shield was omitted in the new design In 2020, a new logo was unveiled featuring a bigger lion and the crown returning from the previous logo The RC emblem was omitted for this crest [143]\n\n\nJersey\nThe jersey colours of the team in 2008 were red and golden yellow, the same as the unofficial Kannada flag, with player names printed in white and numbers printed in black in the rear Yellow was replaced with gold in the future seasons Starting from 2010, blue was introduced on the apparel as a tertiary colour The jersey design saw tweaks every season, major being the one for 2014 where blue dominated over gold From 2014, the player names and numbers were printed in gold As of 2015, [update] more yellowish shade of gold was used on the jerseys Black replaced blue as the tertiary colour in 2016 Also from 2016, two versions of the jersey were used, one for home matches and the other for away ones The kit design remained the same until 2019 The home and away concept was scrapped from 2020 and a darker shade of blue replaced black A design similar to the previous \"home\" version of the jersey was adopted for 2020 and 2021 A completely redesigned jersey with the deep blue as a dominant shade with gold accents was used in 2022 while red was seen predominantly on the trousers.\n\n\nAmbassadors\nKatrina Kaif was the brand ambassador for the team in 2008 Deepika Padukone, Ramya, Puneeth Rajkumar, Shiva Rajkumar, Upendra and Ganesh have been the ambassadors for the team in the later seasons [145]\n\n\nKit manufacturers and sponsors\nThe rivalry between Kolkata Knight Riders and Royal Challengers Bangalore is one of the oldest in the IPL The inaugural match of IPL was played between both the teams in which KKR won by 140 runs due to a 158* off just 73 balls by Brendon McCullum [147]\n\n\nRivalries\nThe rivalry between Kolkata Knight

 \"Southern derby\" and \"South Indian derby\" [153] [154] [155] The Super Kings beat the Royal Challengers in the final of the 2011 IPL, the only meeting between the two teams at an IPL final [156]\n\n\nRivalry with Hyderabad franchises\nAnother notable rivalry involving RCB is with the Hyderabad franchises, first with the Deccan Chargers and now with the Sunrisers Hyderabad The Deccan Chargers won six out of the 11 clashes between the two and the Sunrisers currently lead with 12 games to 11 There is also a notable trend where the Hyderabad franchise has jeopardised RCB's campaigns in some way or the other In the 2009 and 2016 seasons, they were beaten in the finals by Chargers and Sunrisers respectively In the 2020 season, Sunrisers knocked RCB out of the tournament in the eliminator In the 2021 season, Sunrisers, who did not qualify for the playoffs, were able to beat RCB, causing them to finish in 3rd place and forcing them to play the eliminator, which they lost to KKR [157] Their 2022 IPL campaign was also affected by SRH, whom they lost to by 9 wickets after scoring 68 in their first encounter, putting them under pressure because of their negative run rate throughout their otherwise strong campaign [158]\nIn the latest chapter of the rivalry between the two in IPL 2024, like the Kolkata Knight Riders, Sunrisers Hyderabad were the first to break the 263-run record set by RCB, which seemed insurmountable at the time as a result of Chris Gayle's 175 In a more humiliating turn, SRH again broke RCB's record against RCB themselves on their home ground, scoring 287 runs, thanks to a 39-ball century by Travis Head and a 30-ball 67 by Heinrich Klassen Although there was a valiant effort by RCB, spearheaded by Dinesh Karthik's 83 off 35 and captain Faf du Plessis's 62 off 28, RCB still lost by 25 runs [159] SRH would break RCB's 263 record for the third time and score 266 against the Delhi Capitals after setting an all-time T20 record by scoring 125 runs inside the power-play.\n\n\nSupport and fan following\nThe Royal Challengers have a huge and passionate fan base all over India and especially in the city of Bangalore The fans, known to be loyal and vocal in their support, [160] often turn up in large numbers for RCB's home matches, turning the stadium into what is called a \"sea of red\" [161] [162] [163] They are well known for their chants of \"R-C-B, R-C-B\" and chants of \"A-B-D, A-B-D\" for their maestro batsman AB de Villiers, [164] [165] and the co-ordinated Mexican wave at the Chinnaswamy [166] The stadium organisers also provide the home team fans with cheer kits, RCB flags and noisemakers among other items [167] Royal Challengers Bangalore have formed a fan-following group named as Bold Army.\n\n\nSeasons\nLast

Bangalore\n\nIntroduction\nRoyal Challengers Bangalore, commonly referred to as RCB, is a professional Twenty20 cricket team based in Bangalore, India. The team was founded in 2008 and is owned by Vijay Mallya, a businessman and entrepreneur. RCB has been a part of the Indian Premier League (IPL) since its inception and has won several titles, including the Champions League Twenty20 in 2011.\n\nHistory\n## Establishment and Early Years\nIn September 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced the establishment of the Indian Premier League (IPL), a Twenty20 competition set to begin in 2008. On 24 January 2008, an auction was held in Mumbai for the league's teams, which represented eight different cities in India, including Bangalore. The Bangalore franchise was acquired by Vijay Mallya for US$111.6 million, making it the second-highest bid, slightly less than Reliance Industries' US$111.9 million bid for the Mumbai Indians.\n\n## 2008-2010: Initial Seasons\nRCB began their journey in the IPL with a bang, finishing second in the inaugural season. They had a strong squad, featuring players like Anil Kumble, Virat Kohli, and Jacques Kallis. However, they lost to the Deccan Chargers in the final. In the following seasons, RCB continued to perform well, but failed to win the title. They finished runners-up in the 2010 season, losing to the Mumbai Indians in the final.\n\n## 2011-2012: IPL and CLT20 Finals\nOn 8 January 2011, the IPL Governing Council held the auction for the fourth season of the league. Franchises had the option of retaining a maximum of four players for a sum of US$4.5 million. RCB retained only Virat Kohli, leaving their other players to re-enter the auction pool. During the auction, Bangalore made significant acquisitions, including Tillakaratne Dilshan, Zaheer Khan, AB de Villiers, Daniel Vettori, Saurabh Tiwary, Dirk Nannes, and Cheteshwar Pujara. Daniel Vettori was named captain for the season. RCB began their campaign with a win over the newly formed Kochi Tuskers Kerala. However, they faced three consecutive defeats against Mumbai Indians, Deccan Chargers, and Chennai Super Kings. Dirk Nannes was replaced by Chris Gayle because of an injury. Gayle's inclusion led RCB to a seven-match winning streak. In their final league match, RCB defeated defending champions Chennai Super Kings, securing the top position in the points table. They lost the final, again facing the Super Kings, by 58 runs. Chris Gayle was named Man of the Tournament.\n\n## 2013-2015: Kohli Captaincy and Intermediate Seasons\nBefore the 2013 auction, RCB released Mohammad Kaif, Charl Langeveldt, Dirk Nannes, Luke Pomersbach, and Rilee Rossouw. At the auction, they acquired Christopher Barnwell, Daniel Christian, Moises Henriques, Ravi Rampaul, Pankaj Singh, R P Singh, and Jaydev Unadkat. Virat Kohli replaced Daniel Vettori as captain and remained in that role until 2021. During the IPL season, RCB finished fifth in the group stage points table with 9 wins from 16 matches, failing to qualify for the playoffs. Chris Gayle was the second-highest run scorer of the tournament, behind Michael Hussey of the Chennai Super Kings, while Vinay Kumar was the team's highest wicket-taker with 23 wickets.\n\n## 2016-2019: Runners-up and Bottom-table Finishes\nAmid financial scandals involving owner and chairman Vijay Mallya, Amrit Thomas became the chairman of the Royal Challengers. In the 2016 season, RCB introduced different jerseys for home and away matches. During the player auction, they acquired Shane Watson, Kane Richardson, Stuart Binny, Travis Head, and Samuel Badree, among others. Additionally, KL Rahul and Parvez Rasool joined RCB from Sunrisers Hyderabad. RCB won their first match of the season against Sunrisers, with AB de Villiers and Virat Kohli scoring 82 and 75 runs, respectively. However, they struggled in the next six matches, securing only one win against Rising Pune Supergiant, which made it challenging to qualify for the playoffs. However, RCB qualified for the playoffs, losing only one match in their next seven games. They set a record by defeating the Gujarat Lions with a winning margin of 144 runs, the highest in IPL history. RCB finished the group stage in second place on the points table with 18 points. In the playoffs, they faced Gujarat Lions in Qualifier 1 at their home ground, M Chinnaswamy Stadium, and won by 4 wickets, advancing to their third final in nine seasons. In the final against Sunrisers Hyderabad in Bangalore, RCB lost by 8 runs, ending the season as runners-up for the third time in IPL history. Yuzvendra Chahal and Shane Watson were the second and third-highest wicket-takers of the tournament, while Virat Kohli won the Orange Cap for scoring the most runs in the tournament, amassing 973 runs—the highest ever in IPL history.\n\n## 2020-2023: Regain in Form\nIn August 2019, Simon Katich replaced Gary Kirsten as the head coach of the team, and Mike Hesson was appointed as the director of cricket operations.

During the auction, RCB added Aaron Finch, Chris Morris, Joshua Philippe, Kane Richardson, Pavan Deshpande, Dale Steyn, Shahbaz Ahmed, and Isuru Udana to their squad. They also released a new logo ahead of the season. The 2020 IPL season was postponed and eventually held in the UAE due to the COVID-19 pandemic. RCB qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 2016, finishing fourth on the points table with 14 points. They faced Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Eliminator but lost by six wickets. Devdutt Padikkal was the team's leading run-scorer with 473 runs, followed by Virat Kohli with 466 runs and AB de Villiers with 454 runs. Yuzvendra Chahal was the highest wicket-taker, taking 21 wickets, followed by Chris Morris and Mohammad Siraj, who each took 11 wickets.\n\n## 2024-present\nThe Royal Challengers struggled in the first half of the season, losing seven of their first eight games. However, they managed to qualify for the playoffs by winning their next six matches. In the Eliminator against Rajasthan Royals, RCB lost the match by four wickets, failing once again to lift the trophy. Virat Kohli won the Orange Cap, scoring 741 runs, while Yash Dayal became the team's highest wicket-taker with 15 wickets.\n\nTeam Identity\nVijay Mallya wanted to associate one of his top-selling liquor brands, either McDowell's No.1 or Royal Challenge, with the team. The latter was chosen, hence the name.\n\nLivery\nVijay Mallya wanted to associate one of his top-selling liquor brands, either McDowell's No.1 or Royal Challenge, with the team. The latter was chosen, hence the name.\n\nLogo\nThe logo initially consisted of the RC emblem in yellow on a circular red base with the black text \"Royal Challengers Bangalore\" in standard format surrounding the circular logo. The RC crown emblem with the roaring lion placed on the top of the logo was derived from the original Royal Challenge logo. No significant changes took place in the design of the logo except for the replacement of colour yellow with gold from 2009. This logo also had a dotted white circle around the RC emblem. The team also uses an alternate logo for the Game for Green matches, where the green plants surround the logo, and the text Game for Green is placed below the logo. The logo was redesigned in 2016 with the inclusion of black as a secondary colour. The lion emblem in the crest was enlarged, and the shield was omitted in the new design. In 2020, a new logo was unveiled, featuring a bigger lion and the crown returning from the previous logo. The RC emblem was omitted for this crest.\n\nJersey\nThe jersey colours of the team in 2008 were red and golden yellow, the same as the unofficial Kannada flag, with player names printed in white and numbers printed in black in the rear. Yellow was replaced with gold in the future seasons. Starting from 2010, blue was introduced on the apparel as a tertiary colour. The jersey design saw tweaks every season, with the major change being the one for 2014, where blue dominated over gold. From 2014, the player names and numbers were printed in gold. As of 2015, more yellowish shade of gold was used on the jerseys. Black replaced blue as the tertiary colour in 2016. Also from 2016, two versions of the jersey were used, one for home matches and the other for away ones. The kit design remained the same until 2019. The home and away concept was scrapped from 2020, and a darker shade of blue replaced black. A design similar to the previous \"home\" version of the jersey was adopted for 2020 and 2021. A completely redesigned jersey with the deep blue as a dominant shade with gold accents was used in 2022, while red was seen predominantly on the trousers.\n\nAmbassadors\nKatrina Kaif was the brand ambassador for the team in 2008. Deepika Padukone, Ramya, Puneeth Rajkumar, Shiva Rajkumar, Upendra, and Ganesh have been the ambassadors for the team in the later seasons.\n\nKit Manufacturers and Sponsors\nThe team's kit is manufactured by Blasters, while the title sponsor is United India Insurance.\n\nRivalries\nThe rivalry between Kolkata Knight Riders and Royal Challengers Bangalore is one of the oldest in the IPL. The inaugural match of IPL was played between both the teams, in which KKR won by 140 runs due to a 158* off just 73 balls by Brendon McCullum.\n\nRivalry with Kolkata Knight Riders\nThe rivalry between Kolkata Knight Riders and Royal Challengers Bangalore is one of the oldest in the IPL. The inaugural match of IPL was played between both the teams, in which KKR won by 140 runs due to a 158* off just 73 balls by Brendon McCullum.\n\nRivalry with Chennai Super Kings\nThe rivalry is also called \"Kaveri derby\", \"Southern derby\", and \"South Indian derby\". The Super Kings beat the Royal Challengers in the final of the 2011 IPL, the only meeting between the two teams at an IPL final.\n\nRivalry with Hyderabad franchises\nAnother notable rivalry involving RCB is with the Hyderabad franchises, first with the Deccan Chargers and now with the Sunrisers Hyderabad. The Deccan Chargers won six out of the 11 clashes between the two and the Sunrisers currently lead with 12 games to 11. There is also a notable trend where the Hyderabad franchise has jeopardised RCB's campaigns in some way or the other. In the 2009 and 2016 seasons, they were beaten in the finals by Chargers and Sunrisers respectively. In the 2020 season, Sunrisers knocked RCB out of the tournament in the eliminator. In the 2021 season, Sunrisers, who did not qualify for the playoffs, were able to beat RCB, causing them to finish in 3rd place and forcing them to play the eliminator, which they lost to KKR. Their 2022 IPL campaign was also affected by SRH, whom they lost to by 9 wickets after scoring 68 in their first encounter, putting them under pressure because of their negative run rate throughout their otherwise strong campaign. In the latest chapter of the rivalry between the two in IPL 2024, like the Kolkata Knight Riders, Sunrisers Hyderabad were the first to break the 263-run record set by RCB, which seemed insurmountable at the time as a result of Chris Gayle's 175. In a more humiliating turn, SRH again broke RCB's record against RCB themselves on their home ground, scoring 287 runs, thanks to a 39-ball century by Travis Head and a 30-ball 67 by Heinrich Klassen. Although there was a valiant effort by RCB, spearheaded by Dinesh Karthik's 83 off 35 and captain Faf du Plessis's 62 off 28, RCB still lost by 25 runs. SRH would break RCB's 263 record for the third time and score 266 against the Delhi Capitals after setting an all-time T20 record by scoring 125 runs inside the power-play.\n\nSupport and Fan Following\nThe Royal Challengers have a huge and passionate fan base all over India and especially in the city of Bangalore. The fans, known to be loyal and vocal in their support, often turn up in large numbers for RCB's home matches, turning the stadium into what is called a \"sea of red\". They are well known for their chants of \"R-C-B, R-C-B\" and chants of \"A-B-D, A-B-D\" for their maestro batsman AB de Villiers, and the co-ordinated Mexican wave at the Chinnaswamy. The stadium organisers also provide the home team fans with cheer kits, RCB flags and noisemakers among other items. Royal Challengers Bangalore have formed a fan-following group named as Bold Army.\n\nSeasons\nLast updated: 23 May 2024\n\nIndian Premier League\nLast updated: 23 May 2024\n\nChampions League

This form of gameplay has been a staple of the video game industry since its early days, with many iconic titles relying on single-player experiences to engage players. In this article, we will explore the history of single-player games, the key elements that define them, and the ways in which they differ from multiplayer games.\n\n**History**\n-----------\n\nThe earliest video games, such as Tennis for Two (1958), Spacewar! (1962), and Pong (1972), were symmetrical games designed to be played by two players. However, it wasn't until the mid-to late 1970s that single-player games began to gain popularity. Early titles such as Speed Race (1974) and Space Invaders (1978) laid the groundwork for the single-player experiences that would follow.\n\nAs the video game industry continued to evolve, so too did the design of single-player games. The introduction of home consoles such as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Sega Master System in the 1980s paved the way for a new generation of single-player games. These consoles brought with them a wider range of gameplay experiences, from platformers and action-adventure games to role-playing games and sports titles.\n\n**Game Elements**\n-----------------\n\nOne of the key characteristics of single-player games is the reliance on computer-controlled characters to create a narrative and conflict. Unlike multiplayer games, where human players can interact with each other in a dynamic and unpredictable way, single-player games rely on pre-programmed characters and events to drive the gameplay experience.\n\nThis reliance on computer-controlled characters allows single-player games to deliver certain gaming experiences that are typically absent or de-emphasized in multiplayer games. For example, single-player games can create complex, branching narratives that respond to the player's actions, or they can implement intricate gameplay mechanics that require precision and timing.\n\n**Story**\n---------\n\nSingle-player games often rely more heavily on compelling stories to draw the player into the experience and to create a sense of investment. Unlike multiplayer games, where the narrative may be secondary to the gameplay experience, single-player games frequently place the story at the forefront.\n\nThis is because humans are unpredictable, and human players - allies or enemies - cannot be relied upon to carry a narrative in a particular direction. As a result, multiplayer games tend to focus more on gameplay mechanics and less on a linear narrative. In contrast, many single-player games are built around a compelling story, with characters, plot twists, and themes that engage the player on an emotional level.\n\n**Characters**\n------------\n\nWhile multiplayer games rely on human-human interaction for their conflict and sense of camaraderie, single-player games must build these things artificially. This means that single-player games require deeper characterization of their non-player characters in order to create connections between the player and the sympathetic characters and to develop deeper antipathy towards the game's antagonists.\n\nThis is particularly true of role-playing games (RPGs), such as Dragon Quest and the Final Fantasy series, which are primarily character-driven and have a different setting. In these games, the player must develop relationships with non-playable characters (NPCs) and make choices that affect the game's story and outcome.\n\n**Exceptions**\n------------\n\nWhile single-player games often rely on computer-controlled characters to create a narrative and conflict, there are exceptions to this rule. For example, puzzle games such as Tetris or racing games focus squarely on gameplay mechanics, with little or no narrative to speak of.\n\nIn these games, the player's goal is to complete a specific objective, such as clearing a certain number of levels or achieving a high score. While the gameplay may be engaging and challenging, the narrative is absent or secondary to the gameplay experience.\n\n**See Also**\n------------\n\n* Multiplayer\n* Role-playing game\n* Video game design\n* Narrative design\n* Character development\n\n**Bibliography**\n----------------\n\n* Aarseth, Espen J.

(1962), and Pong (1972), were symmetrical games designed to be played by two players Single-player games gained popularity only after this, with early titles such as Speed Race (1974) [2] and Space Invaders (1978).\n\n\nGame elements\nAs the narrative and conflict in single-player gameplay is created by a computer rather than a human opponent, single-player games are able to deliver certain gaming experiences that are typically absent—or de-emphasised—in multiplayer games [14]\n\n\nStory\nSingle-player games rely more heavily on compelling stories to draw the player into the experience and to create a sense of investment Humans are unpredictable, so human players - allies or enemies - cannot be relied upon to carry a narrative in a particular direction, and so multiplayer games tend not to focus heavily on a linear narrative By contrast, many single-player games are built around a compelling story [15]\n\n\nCharacters\nWhile a multiplayer game relies upon human-human interaction for its conflict, and often for its sense of camaraderie, a single-player game must build these things artificially As such, single-player games require deeper characterisation of their non-player characters in order to create connections between the player and the sympathetic characters and to develop deeper antipathy towards the game's antagonists This is typically true of role-playing games (RPGs), such as Dragon Quest and the Final Fantasy, which are primarily character-driven and have a different setting.\n\n\nExceptions\nThese game elements are not firm, fixed rules; single-player puzzle games such as Tetris or racing games focus squarely on gameplay.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

she found work as an insurance claims processor She persuaded her former roommate from Texas Woman's University, Ginny Mathis, to join her, and they found an apartment in the Haight-Ashbury district Mathis acquired a job at the same insurance company as Rice Soon after, they began taking night courses at University of San Francisco, an all-male Jesuit school that allowed women to take classes at

Vampire She based her vampires on Gloria Holden's character in Dracula's Daughter: \"It established to me what vampires were—these elegant, tragic, sensitive people I was really just going with that feeling when writing Interview With the Vampire I didn't do a lot of research.\" [46] After completing the novel and following many rejections from publishers, Rice developed obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) She became obsessed with germs, thinking that she contaminated everything she touched, engaged in frequent and obsessive hand washing and obsessively checked locks on windows and doors

Email clients are typically used to manage email accounts, compose and send new messages, and retrieve and display incoming messages. In this article, we will explore the various aspects of email clients, including message retrieval, composition, submission, encryption, and protocols.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nEmail clients have become an essential tool for communication in the digital age. With the widespread use of the internet and email, email clients have evolved to provide a range of features and functionalities to users. From basic email reading and writing to advanced features such as encryption, filtering, and search, email clients have become increasingly sophisticated. This article will provide an overview of the key aspects of email clients and their role in the email ecosystem.\n\n**Retrieving Messages from a Mailbox**\n\nLike most client programs, an email client is only active when a user runs it. The common arrangement is for an email user (the client) to make an arrangement with a remote Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) server for the receipt and storage of the client's emails. The MTA, using a suitable mail delivery agent (MDA), adds email messages to a client's storage as they arrive. The remote mail storage is referred to as the user's mailbox. Users of the system can log-in and run a mail client on the same computer that hosts their mailboxes; in which case, the server is not actually remote, other than in a generic sense.\n\n**Message Composition**\n\nEmail clients usually contain user interfaces to display and edit text. Some applications permit the use of a program-external editor. When a user wishes to create and send an email, the email client will handle the task. The email client is usually set up automatically to connect to the user's mail server, which is typically either an MSA or an MTA, two variations of the SMTP protocol. The email client which uses the SMTP protocol creates an authentication extension, which the mail server uses to authenticate the sender. This method eases modularity and nomadic computing.\n\n**Submitting Messages to a Server**\n\nWhen a user wishes to create and send an email, the email client will handle the task. The email client is usually set up automatically to connect to the user's mail server, which is typically either an MSA or an MTA, two variations of the SMTP protocol. The email client which uses the SMTP protocol creates an authentication extension, which the mail server uses to authenticate the sender. This method eases modularity and nomadic computing. The older method was for the mail server to recognize the client's IP address, e.g because the client is on the same machine and uses internal address 127.0.0.1, or because the client's IP address is controlled by the same Internet service provider that provides both Internet access and mail services.\n\n**Encryption**\n\nWith no encryption, much like for postcards, email activity is plainly visible by any occasional eavesdropper. Email encryption enables privacy to be safeguarded by encrypting the mail sessions, the body of the message, or both. Without it, anyone with network access and the right tools can monitor email and obtain login passwords. Examples of concern include government censorship and surveillance and fellow wireless network users such as at an Internet cafe.\n\n**Encryption of the Message Body**\n\nThere are two main models for managing cryptographic keys. S/MIME employs a model based on a trusted certificate authority (CA) that signs users' public keys. OpenPGP employs a somewhat more flexible web of trust mechanism that allows users to sign one another's public keys. OpenPGP is also more flexible in the format of the messages, in that it still supports plain message encryption and signing as they used to work before MIME standardization.\n\n**Webmail**\n\nIn addition to email clients running on a desktop computer, there are those hosted remotely, either as part of a remote UNIX installation accessible by telnet (i.e a shell account), or hosted on the Web. Both of these approaches have several advantages: they share an ability to send and receive email away from the user's normal base using a web browser or telnet client, thus eliminating the need to install a dedicated email client on the user's device.\n\n**Remote Messages**\n\nPOP3 has an option to leave messages on the server. By contrast, both IMAP and webmail keep messages on the server as their method of operating, albeit users can make local copies as they like. Keeping messages on the server has advantages and disadvantages.\n\n**Advantages**\n\nPopular protocols for retrieving mail include POP3 and IMAP4. Sending mail is usually done using the SMTP protocol.\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\nPopular protocols for retrieving mail include POP3 and IMAP4. Sending mail is usually done using the SMTP protocol.\n\n**Protocols**\n\nPopular protocols for retrieving mail include POP3 and IMAP4. Sending mail is usually done using the SMTP protocol.\n\n**Port Numbers**\n\nEmail servers and clients by convention use the TCP port numbers in the following table. For MSA, IMAP and POP3, the table reports also the labels that a client can use to query the SRV records and discover both the host name and the port number of the corresponding service.\n\n| Protocol | Port Number | SRV Label |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| MSA | 587 | smtp |\n| IMAP | 143 | imap |\n| POP3 | 110 | pop3 |\n| SMTP | 25 | mail |\n\n**Proprietary Client Protocols**\n\nMicrosoft mail systems use the proprietary Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) in client applications, such as Microsoft Outlook, to access Microsoft Exchange electronic mail servers.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Email\n* Email Server\n* Email Client Software\n* Email Client Comparison\n* Email Client Security\n* Email Client Features\n\nIn conclusion, email clients have become an essential tool for communication in the digital age.

{"title": "Kievan_Rus'", "content": "\nNames\nDuring its existence, Kievan Rus' was known as the \"Rus' land\" (Old East Slavic: ро́усьскаѧ землѧ́, romanized: rusĭskaę zemlę, from the ethnonym Роусь, Rusĭ; Medieval Greek: Ῥῶς, romanized: Rhos; Arabic: الروس, romanized: ar-Rūs), in Greek as Ῥωσία, Rhosia, in Old French as Russie, Rossie, in Latin as Rusia or Russia (with local German spelling variants Ruscia and Ruzzia), and from the 12th century also as Ruthenia or Rutenia [20] [21] Various etymologies have been proposed, including Ruotsi, the Finnish designation for Sweden or Ros, a tribe from the middle Dnieper valley region [22]\n\n\nHistory\nPrior to the emergence of Kievan Rus' in the 9th century, most of the area north of the Black Sea was primarily populated by eastern Slavic tribes [33] In the northern region around Novgorod were the Ilmen Slavs [34] and neighboring Krivichi, who occupied territories surrounding the headwaters of the West Dvina, Dnieper and Volga rivers To their north, in the Ladoga and Karelia regions, were the Finnic Chud tribe In the south, in the area around Kiev, were the Poliane, [35] the Drevliane to the west of the Dnieper, and the Severiane to the east To their north and east were the Vyatichi, and to their south was forested land settled by Slav farmers, giving way to steppelands populated by nomadic herdsmen [36]\n\n\nOrigin\nPrior to the emergence of Kievan Rus' in the 9th century, most of the area north of the Black Sea was primarily populated by eastern Slavic tribes [33] In the northern region around Novgorod were the Ilmen Slavs [34] and neighboring Krivichi, who occupied territories surrounding the headwaters of the West Dvina, Dnieper and Volga rivers To their north, in the Ladoga and Karelia regions, were the Finnic Chud tribe In the south, in the area around Kiev, were the Poliane, [35] the Drevliane to the west of the Dnieper, and the Severiane to the east To their north and east were the Vyatichi, and to their south was forested land settled by Slav farmers, giving way to steppelands populated by nomadic herdsmen [36]\n\n\nCalling of the Varangians\nAccording to the Primary Chronicle, the territories of the East Slavs in the 9th century were divided between the Varangians and the Khazars [56] The Varangians are first mentioned imposing tribute from Slavic and Finnic tribes in 859 [57] [non-primary source needed] In 862, various tribes rebelled against the Varangians, driving them \"back beyond the sea and, refusing them further tribute, set out to govern themselves\" [57]\n\n\nFoundation of the Kievan state\nRurik led the Rus' until his death in about 879 or 882, bequeathing his kingdom to his kinsman, Prince Oleg, as regent for his young son, Igor [70] According to the Primary Chronicle, in 880–82, Oleg led a military force south along the Dnieper river, capturing Smolensk and Lyubech before reaching Kiev, where he deposed and killed Askold and Dir: \"Oleg set himself up as prince in Kiev, and declared that it should be the \"mother of Rus' cities\" [71] [e] Oleg set about consolidating his power over the surrounding region and the riverways north to Novgorod, imposing tribute on the East Slav tribes [62]\n\n\nEarly foreign relations\nThe rapid expansion of the Rus' to the south led to conflict and volatile relationships with the Khazars and other neighbors on the Pontic steppe [79] [80] The Khazars dominated trade from the Volga-Don steppes to eastern Crimea and the northern Caucasus during the 8th century, an era historians call the 'Pax Khazarica', [81] trading and frequently allying with the Byzantine Empire against Persians and Arabs In the late 8th century, the collapse of the Göktürk Khaganate led the Magyars and the Pechenegs, Ugrians and Turkic peoples from Central Asia, to migrate west into the steppe region, [82] leading to military conflict, disruption of trade, and instability within the Khazar Khaganate [83] The Rus' and Slavs had earlier allied with the Khazars against Arab raids on the Caucasus, but they increasingly worked against them to secure control of the trade routes [84]\n\n\nVolatile steppe politics\nThe rapid expansion of the Rus' to the south led to conflict and volatile relationships with the Khazars and other neighbors on the Pontic steppe [79] [80] The Khazars dominated trade from the Volga-Don steppes to eastern Crimea and the northern Caucasus during the 8th century, an era historians call the 'Pax Khazarica', [81] trading and frequently allying with the Byzantine Empire against Persians and Arabs In the late 8th century, the collapse of the Göktürk Khaganate led the Magyars and the Pechenegs, Ugrians and Turkic peoples from Central Asia, to migrate west into the steppe region, [82] leading to military conflict, disruption of trade, and instability within the Khazar Khaganate [83] The Rus' and Slavs had earlier allied with the Khazars against Arab raids on the Caucasus, but they increasingly worked against them to secure control of the trade routes [84]\n\n\nRus'–Byzantine relations\nAfter the Rus' attack on Constantinople in 860, the Byzantine Patriarch Photius sent missionaries north to convert the Rus' and the Slavs to Christianity Prince Rastislav of Moravia had requested the Emperor to provide teachers to interpret the holy scriptures, so in 863 the brothers Cyril and Methodius were sent as missionaries, due to their knowledge of the Slavonic language [69] [103] [failed verification] [104] [non-primary source needed] The Slavs had no written language, so the brothers devised the Glagolitic alphabet, later replaced by Cyrillic (developed in the First Bulgarian Empire) and standardized the language of the Slavs, later known as Old Church Slavonic They translated portions of the Bible and drafted the first Slavic civil code and other documents, and the language and texts spread throughout Slavic territories, including Kievan Rus' [citation needed] The mission of Cyril and Methodius served both evangelical and diplomatic purposes, spreading Byzantine cultural influence in support of imperial foreign policy [105] [dead link‍] In 867 the Patriarch announced that the Rus' had accepted a bishop, and in 874 he speaks of an \"Archbishop of the Rus'.\" [68]\n\n\nSviatoslav\nFollowing the death of Igor in 945, his wife Olga ruled as regent in Kiev until their son Sviatoslav reached maturity (c 963) [h] His decade-long reign over Kievan Rus' was marked by rapid expansion through the conquest of the Khazars of the Pontic steppe and the invasion of the Balkans By the end of his short life, Sviatoslav carved out for himself the largest state in Europe, eventually moving his capital from Kiev to Pereyaslavets on the Danube in 969 [citation needed]\n\n\nReign of Vladimir and Christianisation\nIt is not clearly documented when the title of grand prince was first introduced, but the importance of the Kiev principality was recognized after the death of Sviatoslav I in 972 and the ensuing struggle between Vladimir and Yaropolk The region of Kiev dominated the region for the next two centuries The grand prince (or grand duke) of Kiev controlled the lands around the city, and his formally subordinate relatives ruled the other cities and paid him tribute The zenith of the state's power came during the reigns of Vladimir the Great (r. 980–1015) and Prince Yaroslav I the Wise (r. 1019–1054) Both rulers continued the steady expansion of Kievan Rus' that had begun under Oleg [citation needed]\n\n\nReign of Yaroslav\nYaroslav, known as \"the Wise\", struggled for power with his brothers A son of Vladimir the Great, he was prince of Novgorod at the time of his father's death in 1015 [126]\n\n\nSuccession issues\nIn the centuries that followed the state's foundation, Rurik's descendants shared power over Kievan Rus' The means by which royal power was transferred from one Rurikid ruler to the next is unclear, however, historian Paul Magocsi mentioned that 'Scholars have debated what the actual system of succession was or whether there was any system at all.' [127] According to historian Nancy Kollmann, the rota system was used with the princely succession moving from elder to younger brother and from uncle to nephew, as well as from father to son Junior members of the dynasty usually began their official careers as rulers of a minor district, progressed to more lucrative principalities, and then competed for the coveted throne of Kiev [128] Whatever the case, according to professor Ivan Katchanovski 'no adequate system of succession to the Kievan throne was developed' after the death of Yaroslav the Wise (r. 1019–1054), commencing a process of gradual disintegration [129]\n\n\nFragmentation and decline\nThe rival Principality of Polotsk was contesting the power of the Grand Prince by occupying Novgorod, while Rostislav Vladimirovich was fighting for the Black Sea port of Tmutarakan belonging to Chernigov Three of Yaroslav's sons that first allied together found themselves fighting each other especially after their defeat to the Cuman forces in 1068 at the Battle of the Alta River [citation needed]\n\n\nFinal disintegration\nFollowing the Mongol invasion of Cumania (or the Kipchaks), in which case many Cuman rulers fled to Rus', such as Köten, the state finally disintegrated under the pressure of the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus', fragmenting it into successor principalities who paid tribute to the Golden Horde (the so-called Tatar Yoke) Just prior to the Mongol invasion, Kievan Rus' had been a relatively prosperous region International trade as well as skilled artisans flourished, while its farms produced enough to feed the urban population After the invasion of the late 1230s, the economy shattered, and its population were either slaughtered or sold into slavery; while skilled laborers and artisans were sent to the Mongol's steppe regions [137]\n\n\nSociety\nThe lands of Kievan Rus' were mostly made up of forests and steppes (see East European forest steppe and Central European mixed forests), while its main rivers all originated in the Valdai Hills: the Dnieper, and primarily populated by Slavic and Finnic tribes [139] All tribes were hunter-gatherers to a certain degree, but the Slavs were primarily agriculturalists, growing cereal grains and crops, as well as raising livestock [38] Before the emergence of the Kievan state, these tribes had their own leaders and gods, and interaction between tribes was occasionally marked either by trading goods or fighting battles [38] The most valuable commodities traded were captive slaves and fur pelts (usually in exchange for silver coins or oriental finery), and common trade partners were Volga Bolghar, Khazar Itil and Byzantine Chersonesus [38] By the early 9th century, bands of Scandinavian adventurers known as Varangians and later Rus' started plundering various (Slavic) villages in the region, later extracting tribute in exchange for protection against pillaging by other Varangians [38] Over time, these relationships of tribute for protection evolved into more permanent political structures: the Rus' lords became princes and the Slavic populace their subjects [140]\n\n\nCulture\nThe lands of Kievan Rus' were mostly made up of forests and steppes (see East European forest steppe and Central European mixed forests), while its main rivers all originated in the Valdai Hills: the Dnieper, and primarily populated by Slavic and Finnic tribes [139] All tribes were hunter-gatherers to a certain degree, but the Slavs were primarily agriculturalists, growing cereal grains and crops, as well as raising livestock [38] Before the emergence of the Kievan state, these tribes had their own leaders and gods, and interaction between tribes was occasionally marked either by trading goods or fighting battles [38] The most valuable commodities traded were captive slaves and fur pelts (usually in exchange for silver coins or oriental finery), and common trade partners were Volga Bolghar, Khazar Itil and Byzantine Chersonesus [38] By the early 9th century, bands of Scandinavian adventurers known as Varangians and later Rus' started plundering various (Slavic) villages in the region, later extracting tribute in exchange for protection against pillaging by other Varangians [38] Over time, these relationships of tribute for protection evolved into more permanent political structures: the Rus' lords became princes and the Slavic populace their subjects [140]\n\n\nEconomy\nIn the early 10th century, Kievan Rus' mainly traded with other tribes in Eastern Europe and Scandinavia \"There was little need for complex social structures to carry out these exchanges in the forests north of the steppes So long as the entrepreneurs operated in small numbers and kept to the north, they did not catch the attention of observers or writers\" The Rus' also had strong trading ties to Byzantium, particularly in the early 900s, as treaties in 911 and 944 indicate These treaties deal with the treatment of runaway Byzantine slaves and limitations on the amounts of certain commodities such as silk that could be bought from Byzantium The Rus' used log rafts floated down the Dnieper River by Slavic tribes for the transport of goods, particularly slaves to Byzantium [141]\n\n\nReligion\nAccording to Martin (2009), 'Christianity, Judaism, and Islam had long been known in these lands, and Olga personally converted to Christianity When Vladimir assumed the throne, however, he set idols of Norse, Slav, Finn, and Iranian gods, worshipped by the disparate elements of his society, on a hilltop in Kiev in an attempt to create a single pantheon for his people But for reasons that remain unclear he soon abandoned this attempt in favour of Christianity.' [146]\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe architecture of Kievan Rus' is the earliest period of Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian architecture, using the foundations of Byzantine culture, but with great use of innovations and architectural features Most remains are Russian Orthodox churches or parts of the gates and fortifications of cities [citation needed]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThe East Slavic lands were originally divided into princely domains called zemlias, \"lands\", or volosts (from a term meaning \"power\" or \"government\") [147] A smaller clan-sized unit was called a verv, or pogost, headed by a kopa or viche [148]\n\n\nForeign relations\nFrom the 9th century on, the Pecheneg nomads had an uneasy relationship with Kievan Rus' For over two centuries they launched sporadic raids into Rus', which sometimes escalated into full-scale wars, such as the 920 war on the Pechenegs by Igor of Kiev, reported in the Primary Chronicle, but there were also temporary military alliances e.g., the 943 Byzantine campaign by Igor [i] In 968, the Pechenegs attacked and besieged the city of Kiev [150]\n\n\nMilitary history\nFrom the 9th century on, the Pecheneg nomads had an uneasy relationship with Kievan Rus' For over two centuries they launched sporadic raids into Rus', which sometimes escalated into full-scale wars, such as the 920 war on the Pechenegs by Igor of Kiev, reported in the Primary Chronicle, but there were also temporary military alliances e.g., the 943 Byzantine campaign by Igor [i] In 968, the Pechenegs attacked and besieged the city of Kiev [150]\n\n\nSteppe peoples\nFrom the 9th century on, the Pecheneg nomads had an uneasy relationship with Kievan Rus' For over two centuries they launched sporadic raids into Rus', which sometimes escalated into full-scale wars, such as the 920 war on the Pechenegs by Igor of Kiev, reported in the Primary Chronicle, but there were also temporary military alliances e.g., the 943 Byzantine campaign by Igor [i] In 968, the Pechenegs attacked and besieged the city of Kiev [150]\n\n\nByzantine Empire\nByzantium quickly became the main trading and cultural partner for Kiev, but relations were not always friendly One of the largest military accomplishments of the Rurikid dynasty was the attack on Byzantium in 960 Pilgrims of the Rus' had been making the journey from Kiev to Constantinople for many years, and Constantine Porphyrogenitus, the Emperor of the Byzantine Empire, believed that this gave them significant information about the arduous parts of the journey and where travelers were most at risk, as would be pertinent for an invasion This route took travelers through domain of the Pechenegs, journeying mostly by river In June 941, the Rus' staged a naval ambush on Byzantine forces, making up for their smaller numbers with small, maneuverable boats These boats were ill-equipped for the transportation of large quantities of treasure, suggesting that looting was not the goal The raid was led, according to the Primary Chronicle, by a king called Igor Three years later, the treaty of 944 stated that all ships approaching Byzantium must be preceded by a letter from the Rurikid prince stating the number of ships and assuring their peaceful intent This not only indicates fear of another surprise attack, but an increased Kievan presence in the Black Sea [152]\n\n\nMongols\nThe Mongol Empire invaded Kievan Rus' in the 13th century, devastating numerous cities, including Ryazan, Kolomna, Moscow, Vladimir and Kiev The siege of Kiev in 1240 by the Mongols is generally understood as the end of Kievan Rus' Batu Khan went on to subjugate Galicia and Volhynia, raid Poland and Hungary, and founded the Golden Horde at Sarai in 1242 [153] The conquests mostly halted due to a succession crisis following khan Ogedei's death, leading Batu to return to Mongolia to select the clan's next overlord [153]\n\n\nHistorical assessment\nKievan Rus', although sparsely populated compared to Western Europe, [154] was not only the largest contemporary European state in terms of area but also culturally advanced [155] Literacy in Kiev, Novgorod and other large cities was high [156] [j] Novgorod had a sewage system and wood pavement not often found in other cities at the time [158] The Russkaya Pravda confined punishments to fines and generally did not use capital punishment [k] Certain rights were accorded to women, such as property and inheritance rights [160] [161] [162]\n\n\nIn popular culture\n50°27′00″N 30°31′30″E﻿ / ﻿50.450°N 30.525°E﻿ / 50.450;

Its territory spanned present-day Ukraine, Belarus, and parts of Russia.\n\n**Names**\n\nDuring its existence, Kievan Rus' was known by various names, including \"Rus' land\" (Old East Slavic: ро́усьскаѧ землѧ́, romanized: rusĭskaę zemlę), in Greek as Ῥῶς, romanized: Rhos; Arabic: الروس, romanized: ar-Rūs), in Old French as Russie, Rossie, in Latin as Rusia or Russia (with local German spelling variants Ruscia and Ruzzia), and from the 12th century also as Ruthenia or Rutenia.\n\n**History**\n\nPrior to the emergence of Kievan Rus' in the 9th century, most of the area north of the Black Sea was primarily populated by eastern Slavic tribes.

The Khazars dominated trade from the Volga-Don steppes to eastern Crimea and the northern Caucasus during the 8th century, an era historians call the 'Pax Khazarica.'

By the end of his short life, Sviatoslav carved out for himself the largest state in Europe, eventually moving his capital from Kiev to Pereyaslavets on the Danube in 969.\n\n**Reign of Vladimir and Christianisation**\n\nIt is not clearly documented when the title of grand prince was first introduced, but the importance of the Kiev principality was recognized after the death of Sviatoslav I in 972 and the ensuing struggle between Vladimir and Yaropolk. The region of Kiev dominated the region for the next two centuries. The grand prince (or grand duke) of Kiev controlled the lands around the city, and his formally subordinate relatives ruled the other cities and paid him tribute.\n\n**Reign of Yaroslav**\n\nYaroslav, known as \"the Wise\", struggled for power with his brothers. A son of Vladimir the Great, he was prince of Novgorod at the time of his father's death in 1015. Yaroslav, known as \"the Wise\", struggled for power with his brothers.

A son of Vladimir the Great, he was prince of Novgorod at the time of his father's death in 1015.\n\n**Succession issues**\n\nIn the centuries that followed the state's foundation, Rurik's descendants shared power over Kievan Rus'. The means by which royal power was transferred from one Rurikid ruler to the next is unclear, however. Scholars have debated what the actual system of succession was or whether there was any system at all.\n\n**Fragmentation and decline**\n\nThe rival Principality of Polotsk was contesting the power of the Grand Prince by occupying Novgorod, while Rostislav Vladimirovich was fighting for the Black Sea port of Tmutarakan belonging to Chernigov. Three of Yaroslav's sons that first allied together found themselves fighting each other especially after their defeat to the Cuman forces in 1068 at the Battle of the Alta River.\n\n**Final disintegration**\n\nFollowing the Mongol invasion of Cumania (or the Kipchaks), in which case many Cuman rulers fled to Rus', such as Köten, the state finally disintegrated under the pressure of the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus', fragmenting it into successor principalities who paid tribute to the Golden Horde (the so-called Tatar Yoke).\n\n**Society**\n\nThe lands of Kievan Rus' were mostly made up of forests and steppes, while its main rivers all originated in the Valdai Hills: the Dnieper, and primarily populated by Slavic and Finnic tribes. All tribes were hunter-gatherers to a certain degree, but the Slavs were primarily agriculturalists, growing cereal grains and crops, as well as raising livestock. Before the emergence of the Kievan state, these tribes had their own leaders and gods, and interaction between tribes was occasionally marked either by trading goods or fighting battles.\n\n**Culture**\n\nThe lands of Kievan Rus' were mostly made up of forests and steppes, while its main rivers all originated in the Valdai Hills: the Dnieper, and primarily populated by Slavic and Finnic tribes.

Before the emergence of the Kievan state, these tribes had their own leaders and gods, and interaction between tribes was occasionally marked either by trading goods or fighting battles.\n\n**Economy**\n\nIn the early 10th century, Kievan Rus' mainly traded with other tribes in Eastern Europe and Scandinavia. There was little need for complex social structures to carry out these exchanges in the forests north of the steppes. The Rus' also had strong trading ties to Byzantium, particularly in the early 900s, as treaties in 911 and 944 indicate. These treaties deal with the treatment of runaway Byzantine slaves and limitations on the amounts of certain commodities such as silk that could be bought from Byzantium.\n\n**Religion**\n\nChristianity, Judaism, and Islam had long been known in these lands, and Olga personally converted to Christianity. When Vladimir assumed the throne, however, he set idols of Norse, Slav, Finn, and Iranian gods, worshipped by the disparate elements of his society, on a hilltop in Kiev in an attempt to create a single pantheon for his people. But for reasons that remain unclear he soon abandoned this attempt in favour of Christianity.\n\n**Architecture**\n\nThe architecture of Kievan Rus' is the earliest period of Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian architecture, using the foundations of Byzantine culture, but with great use of innovations and architectural features. Most remains are Russian Orthodox churches or parts of the gates and fortifications of cities.\n\n**Administrative divisions**\n\nThe East Slavic lands were originally divided into princely domains called zemlias, \"lands\", or volosts (from a term meaning \"power\" or \"government\"). A smaller clan-sized unit was called a verv, or pogost, headed by a kopa or viche.\n\n**Foreign relations**\n\nFrom the 9th century on, the Pecheneg nomads had an uneasy relationship with Kievan Rus'. For over two centuries they launched sporadic raids into Rus', which sometimes escalated into full-scale wars, such as the 920 war on the Pechenegs by Igor of Kiev, reported in the Primary Chronicle, but there were also temporary military alliances e.g., the 943 Byzantine campaign by Igor. In 968, the Pechenegs attacked and besieged the city of Kiev.\n\n**Military history**\n\nFrom the 9th century on, the Pecheneg nomads had an uneasy relationship with Kievan Rus'.

In 968, the Pechenegs attacked and besieged the city of Kiev.\n\n**Byzantine Empire**\n\nByzantium quickly became the main trading and cultural partner for Kiev, but relations were not always friendly. One of the largest military accomplishments of the Rurikid dynasty was the attack on Byzantium in 960. Pilgrims of the Rus' had been making the journey from Kiev to Constantinople for many years, and Constantine Porphyrogenitus, the Emperor of the Byzantine Empire, believed that this gave them significant information about the arduous parts of the journey and where travelers were most at risk, as would be pertinent for an invasion.\n\n**Mongols**\n\nThe Mongol Empire invaded Kievan Rus' in the 13th century, devastating numerous cities, including Ryazan, Kolomna, Moscow, Vladimir, and Kiev. The siege of Kiev in 1240 by the Mongols is generally understood as the end of Kievan Rus'. Batu Khan went on to subjugate Galicia and Volhynia, raid Poland and Hungary, and founded the Golden Horde at Sarai in 1242.\n\n**Historical assessment**\n\nKievan Rus', although sparsely populated compared to Western Europe, was not only the largest contemporary European state in terms of area but also culturally advanced. Literacy in Kiev, Novgorod, and other large cities was high. Novgorod had a sewage system and wood pavement not often found in other cities at the time. The Russkaya Pravda confined punishments to fines and generally did not use capital punishment. Certain rights were accorded to women, such as property and inheritance rights.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Kievan_Rus'\" following this outline:\n\n\nNames\nDuring its existence, Kievan Rus' was known as the \"Rus' land\" (Old East Slavic: ро́усьскаѧ землѧ́, romanized: rusĭskaę zemlę, from the ethnonym Роусь, Rusĭ; Medieval Greek: Ῥῶς, romanized: Rhos; Arabic: الروس, romanized: ar-Rūs), in Greek as Ῥωσία, Rhosia, in Old French as Russie, Rossie, in Latin as Rusia or Russia (with local German spelling variants Ruscia and Ruzzia), and from the 12th century also as Ruthenia or Rutenia [20] [21] Various etymologies have been proposed, including Ruotsi, the Finnish designation for Sweden or Ros, a tribe from the middle Dnieper valley region [22]\n\n\nHistory\nPrior to the emergence of Kievan Rus' in the 9th century, most of the area north of the Black Sea was primarily populated by eastern Slavic tribes [33] In the northern region around Novgorod were the Ilmen Slavs [34] and neighboring Krivichi, who occupied territories surrounding the headwaters of the West Dvina, Dnieper and Volga rivers To their north, in the Ladoga and Karelia regions, were the Finnic Chud tribe In the south, in the area around Kiev, were the Poliane, [35] the Drevliane to the west of the Dnieper, and the Severiane to the east To their north and east were the Vyatichi, and to their south was forested land settled by Slav farmers, giving way to steppelands populated by nomadic herdsmen [36]\n\n\nOrigin\nPrior to the emergence of Kievan Rus' in the 9th century, most of the area north of the Black Sea was primarily populated by eastern Slavic tribes [33] In the northern region around Novgorod were the Ilmen Slavs [34] and

forested land settled by Slav farmers, giving way to steppelands populated by nomadic herdsmen [36]\n\n\nCalling of the Varangians\nAccording to the Primary Chronicle, the territories of the East Slavs in the 9th century were divided between the Varangians and the Khazars [56] The Varangians are first mentioned imposing tribute from Slavic and Finnic tribes in 859 [57] [non-primary source needed] In 862, various tribes rebelled against the Varangians, driving them \"back beyond the sea and, refusing them further tribute, set out to govern themselves\" [57]\n\n\nFoundation of the Kievan state\nRurik led the Rus' until his death in about 879 or 882, bequeathing his kingdom to his kinsman, Prince Oleg, as regent for his young son, Igor [70] According to the Primary Chronicle, in 880–82, Oleg led a military force south along the Dnieper river, capturing Smolensk and Lyubech before reaching Kiev, where he deposed and killed Askold and Dir: \"Oleg set himself up as prince in Kiev, and declared that it should be the \"mother of Rus' cities\" [71] [e] Oleg set about consolidating his power over the surrounding region and the riverways north to Novgorod, imposing tribute on the East Slav tribes [62]\n\n\nEarly foreign relations\nThe rapid expansion of the Rus' to the south led to conflict and volatile relationships with the Khazars and other neighbors on the Pontic steppe [79] [80] The Khazars dominated trade from the Volga-Don steppes to eastern Crimea and the northern Caucasus during the 8th century, an era historians call the 'Pax Khazarica', [81] trading and frequently allying with the Byzantine Empire against Persians and Arabs In the late 8th century, the collapse of the Göktürk Khaganate led the Magyars and the Pechenegs, Ugrians and Turkic peoples from Central Asia, to migrate west into the steppe region, [82] leading to military conflict, disruption of trade, and instability within the Khazar Khaganate [83] The Rus' and Slavs had earlier allied with the Khazars against Arab raids on the Caucasus, but they increasingly worked against them to secure control of the trade routes [84]\n\n\nVolatile steppe politics\nThe rapid expansion of

increasingly worked against them to secure control of the trade routes [84]\n\n\nRus'–Byzantine relations\nAfter the Rus' attack on Constantinople in 860, the Byzantine Patriarch Photius sent missionaries north to convert the Rus' and the Slavs to Christianity Prince Rastislav of Moravia had requested the Emperor to provide teachers to interpret the holy scriptures, so in 863 the brothers Cyril and Methodius were sent as missionaries, due to their knowledge of the Slavonic language [69] [103] [failed verification] [104] [non-primary source needed] The Slavs had no written language, so the brothers devised the Glagolitic alphabet, later replaced by Cyrillic (developed in the First Bulgarian Empire) and standardized the language of the Slavs, later known as Old Church Slavonic They translated portions of the Bible and drafted the first Slavic civil code and other documents, and the language and texts spread throughout Slavic territories, including Kievan Rus' [citation needed] The mission of Cyril and Methodius served both evangelical and diplomatic purposes, spreading Byzantine cultural influence in support of imperial foreign policy [105] [dead link‍] In 867 the Patriarch announced that the Rus' had accepted a bishop, and in 874 he speaks of an \"Archbishop of the Rus'.\" [68]\n\n\nSviatoslav\nFollowing the death of Igor in 945, his wife Olga ruled as regent in Kiev until their son Sviatoslav reached maturity (c 963) [h] His decade-long reign over Kievan Rus' was marked by rapid expansion through the conquest of the Khazars of the Pontic steppe and the invasion

(r. 980–1015) and Prince Yaroslav I the Wise (r. 1019–1054) Both rulers continued the steady expansion of Kievan Rus' that had begun under Oleg [citation needed]\n\n\nReign of Yaroslav\nYaroslav, known as \"the Wise\", struggled for power with his brothers A son of Vladimir the Great, he was prince of Novgorod at the time of his father's death in 1015 [126]\n\n\nSuccession issues\nIn the centuries that followed the state's foundation, Rurik's descendants shared power over Kievan Rus' The means by which royal power was transferred from one Rurikid ruler to the next is unclear, however, historian Paul Magocsi mentioned that 'Scholars have debated what the actual system of succession was or whether there was any system at all.' [127] According to historian Nancy Kollmann, the rota system was used with the princely succession moving from elder to younger brother and from uncle to nephew, as well as from father to son Junior members of the dynasty usually began their official careers as rulers of a minor district, progressed to more lucrative principalities, and then competed for the coveted throne of Kiev [128] Whatever the case, according to professor Ivan Katchanovski 'no adequate system of succession to the Kievan throne was developed' after the death of Yaroslav the Wise (r. 1019–1054), commencing a process of gradual disintegration [129]\n\n\nFragmentation and decline\nThe rival Principality of Polotsk was contesting the power of the Grand Prince by occupying Novgorod, while Rostislav Vladimirovich was fighting for the Black Sea port of Tmutarakan belonging to Chernigov Three of Yaroslav's sons that first allied together found themselves fighting each other especially after their defeat to the Cuman forces in 1068 at the Battle of the Alta River [citation needed]\n\n\nFinal disintegration\nFollowing the Mongol invasion of Cumania (or the Kipchaks), in which case many Cuman rulers fled to Rus', such as Köten, the state finally disintegrated under the pressure of the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus', fragmenting it into successor principalities who paid tribute to the Golden Horde (the so-called Tatar Yoke) Just prior to the Mongol invasion, Kievan Rus' had been a relatively prosperous region International trade as well as skilled artisans flourished, while its farms produced enough to feed the urban population After the invasion of the late 1230s, the economy shattered, and its population were either slaughtered or sold into slavery; while skilled laborers and artisans were sent to the Mongol's steppe regions [137]\n\n\nSociety\nThe lands of Kievan Rus' were mostly made up of forests and steppes (see East European forest steppe and Central European mixed forests), while its main rivers all originated in the Valdai Hills: the Dnieper, and primarily populated by Slavic and Finnic tribes [139] All tribes were hunter-gatherers to a certain degree, but the Slavs were primarily agriculturalists, growing cereal grains and crops, as well as raising livestock [38] Before the emergence of the Kievan state, these tribes had their own leaders and gods, and interaction between tribes was occasionally marked either by trading goods or fighting battles [38] The most valuable commodities traded were captive slaves and fur pelts (usually in exchange for silver coins or oriental finery), and common trade partners were Volga Bolghar, Khazar Itil and Byzantine Chersonesus [38] By the early 9th century, bands of Scandinavian adventurers known as Varangians and later Rus' started plundering various (Slavic) villages in the region, later extracting tribute in exchange for protection against pillaging by other Varangians [38] Over time, these relationships of tribute for protection evolved into more permanent political structures: the Rus' lords became princes and the Slavic populace their subjects [140]\n\n\nCulture\nThe lands of Kievan Rus' were mostly made up of forests and steppes (see East European forest steppe and Central European mixed forests), while its main rivers all originated in the Valdai Hills: the Dnieper, and primarily populated by Slavic and Finnic tribes [139] All tribes were hunter-gatherers to a certain degree, but the Slavs were primarily agriculturalists, growing cereal grains and crops, as well as raising livestock [38] Before the emergence of the Kievan state, these tribes had their own leaders and gods, and interaction between tribes was occasionally marked either by trading goods or fighting battles [38] The most valuable commodities traded were captive slaves and fur pelts (usually in exchange for silver coins or oriental finery), and common trade partners were Volga Bolghar, Khazar Itil and Byzantine Chersonesus [38] By the early 9th century, bands of Scandinavian adventurers known as Varangians and later Rus' started plundering various (Slavic) villages in the region, later extracting tribute in exchange for protection against pillaging by other Varangians [38] Over time, these relationships of tribute for protection evolved into more permanent political structures: the Rus' lords became princes and the Slavic populace their subjects [140]\n\n\nEconomy\nIn the early 10th century, Kievan Rus' mainly traded with other tribes in Eastern Europe and Scandinavia \"There was little need for complex social structures to carry out these exchanges in the forests north of the steppes So long as the entrepreneurs operated in small numbers and kept to the north, they did not catch the attention of observers or writers\" The Rus' also had strong trading ties to Byzantium, particularly in the early 900s, as treaties in 911 and 944 indicate These treaties deal with the treatment of runaway Byzantine slaves and limitations on the amounts of certain commodities such as silk that could be bought from Byzantium The Rus' used log rafts floated down the Dnieper River by Slavic tribes for the transport of goods, particularly slaves to Byzantium [141]\n\n\nReligion\nAccording to Martin (2009), 'Christianity, Judaism, and Islam had long been known in these lands, and Olga personally converted to Christianity When Vladimir assumed the throne, however, he set idols of Norse, Slav, Finn, and Iranian gods, worshipped by the disparate elements of his society, on a hilltop in Kiev in an attempt to create a single pantheon for his people But for reasons that remain unclear he soon abandoned this attempt in favour of Christianity.'

{"title": "Zionism", "content": "\nTerminology\nThe term \"Zionism\" is derived from the word Zion (Hebrew: ציון, romanized: Tzi-yon) or Mount Zion, a hill in Jerusalem, widely symbolizing the Land of Israel [21] Mount Zion is also a term used in the Hebrew Bible [22] [23] Throughout eastern Europe in the late 19th century, numerous grassroots groups promoted the national resettlement of the Jews in their homeland, [24] as well as the revitalization and cultivation of the Hebrew language These groups were collectively called the \"Lovers of Zion\" and were seen as countering a growing Jewish movement toward assimilation The first use of the term is attributed to the Austrian Nathan Birnbaum, founder of the Kadimah nationalist Jewish students' movement; he used the term in 1890 in his journal Selbst-Emancipation (Self-Emancipation), [25] [26] itself named almost identically to Leon Pinsker's 1882 book Auto-Emancipation.\n\n\nBeliefs\nFundamental to Zionism is the belief that Jews constitute a nation and have a moral and historic right and need for self-determination in Palestine [d] This belief developed out of the experiences of European Jewry, which the early Zionists believed demonstrated the danger inherent to their status as a minority In contrast to the Zionist notion of nationhood, the Judaic sense of being a nation was rooted in religious beliefs of unique chosenness and divine providence, rather than in ethnicity Daily prayers emphasized distinctiveness from other nations; a connection to Eretz Israel and the anticipation of restoration were based on messianic beliefs and religious practices, not material nationalistic conceptions [28]\n\n\nClaim to a Jewish demographic majority and a Jewish state in Palestine\nFundamental to Zionism is the belief that Jews constitute a nation and have a moral and historic right and need for self-determination in Palestine [d] This belief developed out of the experiences of European Jewry, which the early Zionists believed demonstrated the danger inherent to their status as a minority In contrast to the Zionist notion of nationhood, the Judaic sense of being a nation was rooted in religious beliefs of unique chosenness and divine providence, rather than in ethnicity Daily prayers emphasized distinctiveness from other nations; a connection to Eretz Israel and the anticipation of restoration were based on messianic beliefs and religious practices, not material nationalistic conceptions [28]\n\n\nThe concept of \"transfer\"\nIn order to achieve a Jewish demographic majority, the Zionist movement was faced with a problem, namely the presence of the local Arab (and primarily non-Jewish) population The practical issue of establishing a Jewish state in a majority non-Jewish region was an issue of fundamental practical importance for the Zionist movement [40] [41] Zionists used the term \"transfer\" as a euphemism for the removal, or ethnic cleansing, of the Arab Palestinian population The concept of \"transfer\" had a long pedigree in Zionist thought, with moral considerations rarely entering into the discussions of what was viewed as a logical solution-opposition to transferring the Arab population outside Palestine was typically expressed on practical, rather than moral grounds [42] [43] [44] The concept of forcibly removing the non-Jewish population from Palestine was a notion that garnered support across the entire spectrum of Zionist groups, including its farthest left factions, from early on in the movement's development \"Transfer\" was not only seen as desirable but also as an ideal solution by the Zionist leadership [43] The notion of forcible transfer was so appealing to the movement's leaders that it was considered the most attractive provision in the Peel Commission [45] Indeed, this sentiment was deeply ingrained to the extent that Ben Gurion's acceptance of partition was contingent upon the removal of the Palestinian population [46] He would go as far as to say that transfer was such an ideal solution that it \"must happen some day\" [47]\n\n\nZionism, antisemitism and an \"existential need\" for self-determination\nFrom the perspective of the early Zionist thinkers, Jews living amongst non-Jews are abnormal and suffer from impediments which can only be addressed by rejecting the Jewish identity which developed while living amongst non-Jews Accordingly, the early Zionists sought to develop a nationalist Jewish political life in a territory where Jews constitute a demographic majority [28] [48] [i] The early Zionist thinkers saw the integration of Jews into non-Jewish society as both unrealistic (or insufficient to address the deficiencies associated with the demographic minority status of the Jews in Europe) and undesirable, since assimilation was accompanied by the dilution of Jewish cultural distinctiveness [49] Moses Hess, a leading precursor of Zionism, commented on the perceived insufficiency of assimilation: \"The German hates the Jewish race more than the religion; he objects less to the Jews' peculiar beliefs than to their peculiar noses.\" Prominent leaders of the Zionist movement expressed an \"understanding\" of antisemitism, echoing its beliefs:\n\n\nRace and genetics\nEarly Zionists were the primary Jewish supporters of the idea that Jews are a race, as it \"offered scientific 'proof' of the ethno-nationalist myth of common descent\" [51] According to Raphael Falk, as early as the 1870s Zionist and pre-Zionist thinkers conceived of Jews as belonging to a distinct biological group [52] This re-conceptualization of Jewishness cast the \"volk\" of the Jewish community as a nation-race, in contrast to centuries-old conceptions of the Jewish people as a religious socio-cultural grouping [52] The Jewish historians Heinrich Graetz and Simon Dubnow are largely credited with this creation of Zionism as a nationalist project They drew on religious Jewish sources and non-Jewish texts in reconstructing a national identity and consciousness This new Jewish historiography divorced from and, at times at odds with, traditional Jewish collective memory [44]\n\n\nConquest of labor\nWith the arrival in Palestine of more ideologically motivated settlers after the turn of the century, the Zionist movement began to emphasize the importance of the productivization of Jewish society and the so-called \"conquest of labor,\" the belief that the employment of exclusively Jewish labour was the pre-condition for the development of an independent Jewish society in Palestine [64] The Zionist movement sought to build a \"pure Jewish settlement\" in Palestine on the basis of \"100 per cent Jewish labor\" and the claim to an exclusively Jewish economy [29] [65] The Zionist leadership aimed to establish a fully autonomous and independent Jewish economic sector to create a new type of Jewish society This new society was intended to reverse the traditional economic structure seen in the Jewish Diaspora, characterized by a high number of middlemen and a scarcity of productive workers By developing fundamental sectors such as industry, agriculture, and mining, the goal was to \"normalize\" Jewish life which had grown \"abnormal\" as a result of living amongst non-Jews [29] Most of the Zionist leadership saw it as imperative to employ strictly Jewish workers in order to ensure the Jewish character of the colonies; indeed they sought to minimize mixing with Arabs to, amongst other reasons, avoid the passing of \"Arab values\" into Zionist society [66] [65]\n\n\nNegation of the life in the Diaspora\nZionism rejected traditional Judaic definitions of what it means to be Jewish, but struggled to offer a new interpretation of Jewish identity independent of rabbinical tradition Jewish religion is viewed as an essentially negative factor, even in religious Zionist ideology, and seen as responsible for the diminishing status of Jews living as a minority [70] Responding to the challenges of modernity, Zionism sought to replace religious and community institutions with secular-nationalistic ones, defining Judaism in \"Christian terms.\" [71] Indeed, Zionism maintained primarily the outward symbols of Jewish tradition, redefining them in a nationalistic context It adapted traditional Jewish religious concepts, such as the devotion to the God of Israel, reverence for the biblical Land of Israel, and the belief in a future Jewish return during the messianic era, into a modern nationalist framework To be sure, the yearning for a return to the land of Israel \"was entirely quietistic\" and the daily prayers of a return to Zion were all accompanied by an appeal to God, rather than a call to Jews to take it upon themselves to appropriate the land [28] [72] Zionism saw itself as bringing Jews into the modern world by redefining what it means to be Jewish in terms of identification with a sovereign state, rather than Judaic faith and tradition [71]\n\n\nZionism and secular Jewish identity\nZionism sought to reconfigure Jewish identity and culture in nationalist and secular terms This new identity would be based on a rejection of the life of exile Zionism portrayed the Diaspora Jew as mentally unstable, physically frail, and prone to engaging in transient businesses like peddling or acting as intermediaries They were seen as detached from nature, purely materialistic, and focused solely on their personal gains In contrast, the vision for the new Jew was radically different: an individual of strong moral and aesthetic values, not shackled by religion, driven by ideals and willing to challenge degrading circumstances; a liberated, dignified person eager to defend both personal and national pride [48] [49]\n\n\nRevival of the Hebrew language\nThe revival of the Hebrew language in Eastern Europe as a secular literary medium marked a significant cultural shift among Jews, who per Judaic tradition used Hebrew only for religious purposes [citation needed] This secularization of Hebrew, which included its use in novels, poems, and journalism, was met with resistance from rabbis who viewed it as a desecration of the sacred language While some rabbinical authorities did support the development of Hebrew as a common vernacular, they did so on the basis of nationalistic ideas, rather than on the basis of Jewish tradition [28] Eliezer Ben Yehuda, a key figure in the revival, envisioned Hebrew as serving a \"national spirit\" and cultural renaissance in the Land of Israel [77] The primary motivator for establishing modern Hebrew as a national language was the sense of legitimacy it gave the movement, by suggesting a connection between the Jews of ancient Israel and the Jews of the Zionist movement [78] These developments are seen in Zionist historiography as a revolt against tradition, with the development of Modern Hebrew providing the basis on which a Jewish cultural renaissance might develop [28]\n\n\nHistory\nThe transformation of a religious and primarily passive connection between Jews and Palestine into an active, secular, nationalist movement arose in the context of ideological developments within modern European nations in the 19th century The concept of the \"return\" remained a powerful symbol within religious Jewish belief which emphasized that their return should be determined by Divine Providence rather than human action [71] Leading Zionist historian Shlomo Avineri describes this connection: \"Jews did not relate to the vision of the Return in a more active way than most Christians viewed the Second Coming.\" The religious Judaic notion of being a nation was distinct from the modern European notion of nationalism [49] Ultra-Orthodox Jews strongly opposed collective Jewish settlement in Palestine, [k] viewing it as a violation of the three oaths sworn to God: not to force their way into the homeland, not to hasten the end times, and not to rebel against other nations They believed that any attempt to achieve redemption through human actions, rather than divine intervention and the coming of the Messiah, constituted a rebellion against divine will and a dangerous heresy [l]\n\n\nHistorical and religious background\nThe transformation of a religious and primarily passive connection between Jews and Palestine into an active, secular, nationalist movement arose in the context of ideological developments within modern European nations in the 19th century The concept of the \"return\" remained a powerful symbol within religious Jewish belief which emphasized that their return should be determined by Divine Providence rather than human action [71] Leading Zionist historian Shlomo Avineri describes this connection: \"Jews did not relate to the vision of the Return in a more active way than most Christians viewed the Second Coming.\" The religious Judaic notion of being a nation was distinct from the modern European notion of nationalism [49] Ultra-Orthodox Jews strongly opposed collective Jewish settlement in Palestine, [k] viewing it as a violation of the three oaths sworn to God: not to force their way into the homeland, not to hasten the end times, and not to rebel against other nations They believed that any attempt to achieve redemption through human actions, rather than divine intervention and the coming of the Messiah, constituted a rebellion against divine will and a dangerous heresy [l]\n\n\nForerunners of Zionism\nThe forerunners of Zionism, rather than being causally connected to the later development of Zionism, are thinkers and activists who expressed some notion of Jewish national consciousness or advocated for the migration of Jews to Palestine These attempts were not continuous as national movements typically are [86] [87] The most notable precursors to Zionism were thinkers such as Judah Alkalai and Zvi Hirsch Kalischer (who were both rabbinical figures), as well as Moses Hess who is regarded as the first modern Jewish nationalist [88]\n\n\nEstablishment of the Zionist movement\nThe idea of returning to Palestine was rejected by the conferences of rabbis held in that epoch Individual efforts supported the emigration of groups of Jews to Palestine, pre-Zionist Aliyah, even before the First Zionist Congress in 1897, the year considered as the start of practical Zionism [97]\n\n\nJewish nationalism and emancipation\nIdeas of Jewish cultural unity developed a specifically political expression in the 1860s as Jewish intellectuals began promoting the idea of Jewish nationalism Zionism would be just one of several Jewish national movements which would develop, others included diaspora nationalist groups such as the Bund [102] [page needed]\n\n\nTheodor Herzl and the birth of modern political Zionism\nIn the wake of the 1881 Russian pogroms, Leo Pinsker, who was previously an assimilationist, came to the conclusion that the root of the Jewish problem was that Jews formed a distinctive element which could not be assimilated [49] For Pinsker, emancipation could not resolve the problems of the Jewish people [105] In Pinsker's analysis, Judeophobia was the cause of antisemitism and was primiarily driven by Jews' lack of a homeland The solution Pinsker proposed in his pamphlet, Autoemancipation, was for Jews to become a \"normal\" nation and acquire a homeland over which Jews would have sovereignty [71] [105] Pinsker primarily viewed Jewish emigration a solution for dealing with the \"surplus of Jews, the inassimilable residue\" from Eastern Europe who had arrived in Germany in response to the pogroms [65] [m]\n\n\nSuccess and stumbles in Russia\nBefore World War I, although led by Austrian and German Jews, Zionism was primarily composed of Russian Jews [113] Initially, Zionists were a minority, both in Russia and worldwide [114] [115] [116] [117] Russian Zionism quickly became a major force within the movement, making up about half the delegates at Zionist Congresses [118]\n\n\nTerritories considered\nThroughout the first decade of the Zionist movement, there were several instances where some Zionist figures, including Herzl, considered a Jewish state in places outside Palestine, such as \"Uganda\" (actually parts of British East Africa today in Kenya), Argentina, Cyprus, Mesopotamia, Mozambique, and the Sinai Peninsula [123] Herzl, the founder of political Zionism, was initially content with any Jewish self-governed state [124] Jewish settlement of Argentina was the project of Maurice de Hirsch [125] It is unclear if Herzl seriously considered this alternative plan, [126] however he later reaffirmed that Palestine would have greater attraction because of the historic ties of Jews with that area [127]\n\n\nEarly Zionist settlement\nIn the early twentieth century, Zionism advanced by establishing towns, colonies, and an independent monetary system to channel Jewish capital into Palestine Due to the unstable local economy and fluctuating currency values under Ottoman rule, Zionists created their own financial institutions, including the first locally headquartered bank and credit cooperative societies Despite their small numbers, the Zionists instilled a fear of territorial displacement and dispossession in the local Palestinian population [138] This fear would be the main driver of antagonism from the Arabs, [139] leading to physical resistance and the eventual use of military force by settlers Initially, the impact on rural Palestinians was minimal, with only a few villages encountering Jewish colonies However, after World War I and as Zionist land purchase increased, the rural population began to experience dramatic changes From almost the beginning of Zionist settlement, the Palestinians viewed Zionism as an expansionist endeavor According to Israeli historian Benny Morris, Zionism was inherently expansionist and always had the goal of turning the entirety of Palestine into a Jewish state In addition, Morris describes the Zionists as intent on politically and physically dispossessing the Arabs [42] Early warnings from local leaders in the 1880s about the destabilizing effects of Jewish immigration went largely unheeded until these later developments [138] By the early 20th century, there were fourteen Zionist settlements in Palestine, established through land purchases from both local and external landowners These were the Zionists of the First Aliyah [138]\n\n\nThe Second Aliyah\nThe second wave of Zionist settlement came with the second aliyah starting in 1904 The settlers of the Second Aliyah laid the foundational elements for the Jewish society in Palestine envisioned by the Zionist movement They established the first two political parties, the socialist Po'alei Zion and the non-socialist Ha-Po'el Ha-Tza'ir and initiated the first collective agricultural settlements known as kibbutzim, which were fundamental in the formation of the Israeli state [65] They also formed the first underground military group, Ha-Shomer, which later evolved into the Haganah and eventually became the core of the Israeli army Many leaders of the Zionist national movement, including David Ben-Gurion, Berl Katznelson, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, Moshe Sharett, Levi Eshkol, Yosef Sprinzak, Yitzhak Tabenkin, and Aharon David Gordon, were products of the Second Aliyah [64] The Zionists of the second aliyah were also more ideologically motivated than those of the first aliyah In particular, they sought the \"conquest of labor\" which entailed the exclusion of Arabs from the labor market [65]\n\n\nThe Balfour Declaration and World War I\nAt the start of the war, the Zionist leadership initiated attempts to persuade the British government of the benefits of sponsoring a Jewish colony in Palestine Their main initial success was in establishing a lobbying group centered around the Rothschild family, largely driven by Chaim Weizmann, [104] with official negotiations beginning in 1916 The ensuing Balfour declaration came shortly afterwards in November 1917 In it, Britain formally declared its commitment to establishing a Jewish homeland in Palestine The declaration was largely motivated by war-time considerations and antisemitic preconceptions about the putative influence Jews had on the Tsarist government and in the shaping of American policy [69] [138] Though his decision was also motivated by religious convictions, [n] Balfour himself had passed the Aliens Act 1905 which aimed to keep Eastern European Jews out of Britain [o] More decisive were Britain's colonial and imperial geopolitical goals in the region, specifically in retaining control over the Suez Canal by establishing a pro-British state in the region [69] [143] Weizmann's role in obtaining the Balfour Declaration led to his election as the Zionist movement's leader He remained in that role until 1948, and then was elected as the first President of Israel after the nation gained independence.\n\n\nThe British Mandate and development of the Zionist quasi-state\nAfter the war, the plan for a greater Arab kingdom under the Hashemite family was abandoned when King Feisal was expelled from Damascus by the French in 1920 In parallel, the Zionist demand for a clear British acknowledgment of the entirety of Palestine as the Jewish national home was rejected Instead, Britain committed only to establishing a Jewish national home \"in Palestine\" and promised to facilitate this without prejudicing the rights of existing \"non-Jewish communities\" These qualifying statements aroused the concern of Zionist leaders at the time [64]\n\n\nBritish policies and the development of Zionist institutions\nBritish policies supporting these efforts were pursued at the expense of the socioeconomic development of the Arab sector For example, the taxation system imposed by the mandatory government extracted greater relative costs (as well as in absolute numbers) from the Arab population At the same time, the main British mandatory expenditures from 1933 to 1937 were for economic development and security expenses, in support of the Jewish population In this sense, the growth of the Jewish economic sector came at the expense of the Arab population [146] British policies encouraged the proletarianization of the Arab peasantry and reinforced the wage gap between Jewish and Arab laborers [143] The mandate also included an article describing self-governing institutions intended only for the Jewish population of Palestine No similar support or recognition was provided to the Palestinian majority at any point during the time of the mandate [144]\n\n\nZionist policies and the 1936-1939 Arab Revolt\nFor the Zionist movement, economic development and policies were a mechanism by which political aims could be achieved [147] A new economic sector exclusively for Jews, controlled by the Labor Zionist movement, was established with support from the Jewish National Fund (JNF) and the agricultural workers' Histadrut The JNF and Histadrut aimed to remove land and labor from the market, effectively excluding Palestinian Arabs Despite the universalist ideals of Zionist pioneering, this new Jewish economic sector was fundamentally based on exclusionary practices [65] Throughout the duration of the British Mandate, the labor movement was largely driven by the goal of achieving \"100 percent of Hebrew labour.\" This was primary driver of the territorial, economic and social separation between Jews and Arabs [29]\n\n\nThe Peel Commission transfer proposal\nAt this point, Jews owned 5.6% of the land in Palestine; the land allocated to the Jewish state would contain 40 percent of the country's fertile land [143] The commission also recommended the expulsion (or the euphemistic \"compulsory transfer\") of the Palestinian population from the land designated for the Jewish state [144] For Ben-Gurion, the transfer proposal was the most appealing recommendation put forward by the commission; he would write in his diary:\n\n\nNazism, World War II and the Holocaust\nIn 1939, a British White Paper would recommend limiting Jewish immigration and land purchase with the objective of maintaining the status quo while the threat of war loomed in Europe [66] [138] This planned to allow no more than 75,000 additional Jewish migrants over a five-year period With Nazi expansionism in Europe, the limits on immigration prompted further militarization, land takeover and illegal immigration efforts by the Zionist movement The second world war broke out as the Zionists were developing their campaign against the White Paper—unable to accept the White Paper or to side against the British, the Zionist movement would ultimately support the British war effort while working to upend the White Paper [110] [r] From the start of the second world war, the Zionists pressured the British to organize and train a Jewish \"army,\" culminating in the establishment of a Jewish Brigade and accompanying blue and white flag [66] [64] The development of this force would further train and enable the already substantial Zionist military capacity [144] [66] [138] The Haganah was allowed by the British to openly acquire weapons and worked with the British to prepare for a possible Axis invasion [110]\n\n\nEnd of the Mandate and expulsion of the Palestinians\nTowards the end of the war, the Zionist leadership was motivated more than ever to establish a Jewish state Since the British were no longer sponsoring its development, many Zionists considered it would be necessary to establish the state by force by upending the British position in Palestine In this the IRA's tactics against Britain in the Irish War of Independence served as a both a model and source of inspiration [t] The Irgun, the military arm of the revisionist Zionists, led by Menachem Begin, and the Stern Gang, which at one point sought an alliance with the Nazis, [66] would lead a series of terrorist attacks against the British starting in 1944 This included the King David Hotel bombing, British immigration and tax offices and police stations It was only by the war's end that the Haganah joined in the sabotage against the British The combined impact of US opinion and the attacks on British presence eventually led the British to refer the situation to the United Nations in 1947 [110]\n\n\nHebraization of names\nAs part of the effort to consolidate its new ownership over the land it had taken over in the 1948 war, the Israeli state worked towards \"erasing all traces of its former owners.\" [164] The project of \"Hebraization\" of the map, for which the JNF Naming Committee was established, [165] aimed to replace what remained of the Arab towns and villages with newly named Israeli settlements These names were often based on the Arab names but with a \"Hebrew pronunciation\" or based on old Hebrew biblical names [164] This effort also sought to demonstrate continuous Jewish ownership over the land to ancient times [164] Moshe Dayan would later speak to the appropriation of Arab place names:\n\n\nPost-World War II\nWith the German invasion of the USSR in 1941, Stalin reversed his long-standing opposition to Zionism, and tried to mobilize worldwide Jewish support for the Soviet war effort A Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee was set up in Moscow Many thousands of Jewish refugees fled the Nazis and entered the Soviet Union during the war, where they reinvigorated Jewish religious activities and opened new synagogues [166] In May 1947 Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko told the United Nations that the USSR supported the partition of Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state The USSR formally voted that way in the UN in November 1947 [167] However once Israel was established, Stalin reversed positions, favoured the Arabs, arrested the leaders of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, and launched attacks on Jews in the USSR [168]\n\n\nReligious Zionism and the Six-Day War\nThe 1967 Six-Day War was followed by the emergence of \"religious Zionism.\" [179] The Israeli conquest of the West Bank, referred to by Zionists as Judea and Samaria, indicated to religious Zionists that they were living in a messianic era For them, the war was a demonstration of the work of the Divine Hand and the \"beginning of redemption.\" The rabbis following in this line of thought immediately began to venerate the land as sacred, making its sanctity a core principle of religious Zionism Consequently, anyone willing to cede parts of this land was seen as a traitor to the Jewish people This belief contributed to the religiously motivated assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, which was carried out with the approval of some Orthodox rabbis [104] Rabbi Kook, a main religious Zionist leader and thinker, would declare in 1967 following the Six Day War in the presence of Israeli leadership including the president, ministers, members of the Knesset, judges, chief rabbis and senior civil servants:\n\n\nRole in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict\nThe arrival of Zionist settlers to Palestine in the late 19th century is widely seen as the start of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict [181] [182] [183]\nZionists wanted to create a Jewish state in Palestine with as much land, as many Jews, and as few Palestinian Arabs as possible [4] In response to Ben-Gurion's 1938 quote that \"politically we are the aggressors and they  [the Palestinians] defend themselves\", Israeli historian Benny Morris says, \"Ben-Gurion, of course, was right Zionism was a colonizing and expansionist ideology and movement\", and that \"Zionist ideology and practice were necessarily and elementally expansionist.\" Morris describes the Zionist goal of establishing a Jewish state in Palestine as necessarily displacing and dispossessing the Arab population [107]\nThe practical issue of establishing a Jewish state in a majority non-Jewish and Arab region was a fundamental issue for the Zionist movement [107] Zionists used the term \"transfer\" as a euphemism for the removal, or ethnic cleansing, of the Arab Palestinian population [fn 2] [184] According to Benny Morris, \"the idea of transferring the Arabs out.. was seen as the chief means of assuring the stability of the 'Jewishness' of the proposed Jewish State\" [107]\n\n\nTypes\nFrom the turn of the century until the Arab revolt of 1936, there was room for political flexibility within the Zionist movement Even so, the ideological framework within which the movement operated constrained the political moves made by groups within the movement A key tenant of this framework involved seeking the support of a Great Power through which to achieve the acquiescence of the Palestinians [64]\n\n\nLabor Zionism\nIn Labor Zionist thought, a revolution of the Jewish soul and society was necessary and achievable in part by Jews moving to Israel and becoming farmers, workers, and soldiers in a country of their own Labor Zionists established rural communes in Israel called \"kibbutzim\" [195] which began as a variation on a \"national farm\" scheme, a form of cooperative agriculture where the Jewish National Fund hired Jewish workers under trained supervision The kibbutzim were a symbol of the Second Aliyah in that they put great emphasis on communalism and egalitarianism, representing Utopian socialism to a certain extent Furthermore, they stressed self-sufficiency, which became an essential aspect of Labor Zionism [196] [197]\n\n\nLiberal Zionism\nGeneral Zionism (or Liberal Zionism) was initially the dominant trend within the Zionist movement from the First Zionist Congress in 1897 until after the First World War General Zionists identified with the liberal European middle class to which many Zionist leaders such as Herzl and Chaim Weizmann aspired Liberal Zionism, although not associated with any single party in modern Israel, remains a strong trend in Israeli politics advocating free market principles, democracy and adherence to human rights Their political arm was one of the ancestors of the modern-day Likud Kadima, the main centrist party during the 2000s that split from Likud and is now defunct, however, did identify with many of the fundamental policies of Liberal Zionist ideology, advocating among other things the need for Palestinian statehood in order to form a more democratic society in Israel, affirming the free market, and calling for equal rights for Arab citizens of Israel In 2013, Ari Shavit suggested that the success of the then-new Yesh Atid party (representing secular, middle-class interests) embodied the success of \"the new General Zionists.\" [201] [better source needed]\n\n\nRevisionist Zionism\n\nRevisionist Zionists, led by Ze'ev Jabotinsky, believed that a Jewish state must expand to both sides of the Jordan River, i.e taking Transjordan in addition to all of Palestine [205] [206] The movement developed what became known as Nationalist Zionism, whose guiding principles were outlined in the 1923 essay Iron Wall, a term denoting the force needed to prevent Palestinian resistance against colonization [207] Jabotinsky wrote that\n\nReligious Zionism\nDefunct\n\n\nNon-Jewish support\nThe French government, through Minister M Cambon, formally committed itself to \"... the renaissance of the Jewish nationality in that Land from which the people of Israel were exiled so many centuries ago.\" [215]\n\n\nChristian support for Zionism\nChristian Zionism is primarily driven by the belief that the return of Jews to the Holy Land will either lead to their conversion to Christianity or their destruction This belief is criticized by Gershom Gorenberg in his book \"The End of Days,\" where he highlights the troubling aspect of this messianic scenario—the disappearance of Jews Evangelical figures like Jerry Falwell believe the establishment of Israel is a pivotal event signaling the Second Coming of Christ and the eventual End of the World As a result, Christian Zionists have significantly contributed politically and financially to Israeli nationalist forces, with the understanding that Israel's role is to facilitate the Second Coming of Christ and the elimination of Judaism [217]\n\n\nMuslim support for Zionism\nMuslims who have publicly defended Zionism include Tawfik Hamid, Islamic thinker and reformer [236] and former member of al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, an Islamist militant group that is designated as a terrorist organization by the European Union [237] and United Kingdom, [238] Sheikh Prof Abdul Hadi Palazzi, Director of the Cultural Institute of the Italian Islamic Community [239] and Tashbih Sayyed, a Pakistani-American scholar, journalist, and author [240]\n\n\nHindu support for Zionism\nAfter Israel's creation in 1948, the Indian National Congress government opposed Zionism Some writers have claimed that this was done in order to get more Muslim votes in India (where Muslims numbered over 30 million at the time) [244] Zionism, seen as a national liberation movement for the repatriation of the Jewish people to their homeland then under British colonial rule, appealed to many Hindu nationalists, who viewed their struggle for independence from British rule and the Partition of India as national liberation for long-oppressed Hindus [citation needed]\n\n\nAnti-Zionism\nZionism has been opposed by a wide variety of organizations and individuals In 1919, the US-based King–Crane Commission found that the subjection of Palestinians to Zionist rule was a violation of the principle of self-determination The report stated that \"The initial claim, often submitted by Zionist representatives, that they have a 'right' to Palestine based on occupation of two thousand years ago, can barely be seriously considered.\" [249] [250]\n\n\nCatholic Church and Zionism\nShortly after the First Zionist Congress, the semi-official Vatican periodical (edited by the Jesuits) Civiltà Cattolica gave its biblical-theological judgement on political Zionism: \"1827 years have passed since the prediction of Jesus of Nazareth was fulfilled .. that  [after the destruction of Jerusalem] the Jews would be led away to be slaves among all the nations and that they would remain in the dispersion  [diaspora, galut] until the end of the world.\" [262] The Jews should not be permitted to return to Palestine with sovereignty: \"According to the Sacred Scriptures, the Jewish people must always live dispersed and vagabondo  [vagrant, wandering] among the other nations, so that they may render witness to Christ not only by the Scriptures .. but by their very existence\" [262]\n\n\nCharacterization as colonialist and racist\nZionism is often considered to be an example of a colonial [14] or racist [15] movement According to historian Avi Shlaim, throughout its history up to present day, Zionism \"is replete with manifestations of deep hostility and contempt towards the indigenous population.\" Shlaim balances this by pointing out that there have always been individuals within the Zionist movement that have criticized such attitudes He cites the example of Ahad Ha'am, who after visiting Palestine in 1891, published a series of articles criticizing the aggressive behaviour and political ethnocentrism of Zionist settlers Ha'am reportedly wrote that the Yishuv \"behave towards the Arabs with hostility and cruelty, trespass unjustly upon their boundaries, beat them shamefully without reason and even brag about it, and nobody stands to check this contemptible and dangerous tendency\" and that they believed that \"the only language that the Arabs understand is that of force.\" [265] Some criticisms of Zionism claim that Judaism's notion of the \"chosen people\" is the source of racism in Zionism, [266] despite, according to Gustavo Perednik, that being a religious concept unrelated to Zionism [267] This characterization of Zionism as a colonialism has been made by, among others, Gershon Shafir, Michael Prior, Ilan Pappe, and Baruch Kimmerling [14] Noam Chomsky, John P Quigly, Nur Masalha, and Cheryl Rubenberg have criticized Zionism, saying that it unfairly confiscates land and expels Palestinians [268] Isaac Deutscher has called Israelis the 'Prussians of the Middle East', who have achieved a 'totsieg', a 'victorious rush into the grave' as a result of dispossessing 1.5 million Palestinians Israel had become the 'last remaining colonial power' of the twentieth century [269] Saleh Abdel Jawad, Nur Masalha, Michael Prior, Ian Lustick, and John Rose have criticized Zionism for having been responsible for violence against Palestinians, such as the Deir Yassin massacre, Sabra and Shatila massacre, and Cave of the Patriarchs massacre [270]\n\n\nHaredi Judaism and Zionism\nHaredi Jews number some 2,100,000 world-wide, constituting 14% of the total Jewish population in the world [300] Most accept the secular Israeli state [301] A small number of Orthodox organizations among these Haredi reject Zionism as they view it as a secular movement and reject nationalism as a doctrine in Jerusalem, certain Hasidic groups, most famously the Satmar Hasidim, as well as the larger movement they are part of, the Edah HaChareidis, are opposed to its ideology for religious reasons Despite having his life saved by a leader of the Zionist movement in 1944, one of the best known Hasidic opponents of political Zionism was Hungarian rebbe and Talmudic scholar Joel Teitelbaum [302] Although this group of ultra-observant Jews do not support or identify with Zionism as a movement or ideology, in a poll taken in February 2024, 83% said they have a \"very strong emotional connection\" to Israel, only a small percentage less than the 87% of Modern Orthodox Jews who reported having those same feelings [303]\n\n\nAnti-Zionism or antisemitism\nCritics of anti-Zionism have argued that opposition to Zionism can be hard to distinguish from antisemitism, [310] [311] and that criticism of Israel may be used as an excuse to express viewpoints that might otherwise be considered antisemitic [312] [313] In discussion of the relationship between antisemitism and anti-Zionism, \"one theory holds that anti-Zionism is no more than veiled anti-Semitism\" This is contrasted with the theory \"that criticism of Israeli politics has been discredited as anti-Zionism, and thus linked with anti-Semitism, in order to prevent such criticism\" [314]\n\n\nZionism and colonialism\nAccording to Joseph Massad, Zionism was connected with European colonial thought from early on in its development Massad describes anti-semitism and a shared interest in the colonial project as the basis of the collaboration between Jewish and non-Jewish Zionists during the beginning of the movement's development He argues that the collaboration between the Zionist movement and European imperialism was essential to the movement's development [v] [318] In this vein, Gershon Shafir describes the use of violence by a colonial metropole as essential to settler colonization Shafir defines settler-colonialism as the creation of a permanent home in which settlers benefit from privileges withheld from the indigenous population He describes colonization, the establishment of settlements against the wishes of the indigenous people, as the distinctive characteristic of settler colonialism [319]\n\n\nZionism as settler colonialism\nBeyond characterizing it as a colonial movement, Zionism has been more recently described as a form of settler colonialism, with proponents of this paradigm including Edward Said, Rashid Khalidi, Noam Chomsky, Ilan Pappe, Fayez Sayegh, Maxime Rodinson, George Jabbour, Ibrahim Abu-Lughod, Baha Abu-Laban, Jamil Hilal, and Rosemary Sayigh [334]

century, advocating for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. The movement's core idea is that the Jewish people have a unique national identity and a historic right to self-determination in the Land of Israel.\n\n**Terminology**\n\nThe term \"Zionism\" is derived from the word Zion (Hebrew: ציון, romanized: Tzi-yon) or Mount Zion, a hill in Jerusalem, widely symbolizing the Land of Israel. The concept of Zionism has its roots in Jewish history and tradition, but its modern form emerged in the late 19th century.\n\n**Historical and Religious Background**\n\nThe transformation of a religious and primarily passive connection between Jews and Palestine into an active, secular, nationalist movement arose in the context of ideological developments within modern European nations in the 19th century. The concept of the \"return\" remained a powerful symbol within religious Jewish belief, emphasizing that their return should be determined by Divine Providence rather than human action.\n\n**Forerunners of Zionism**\n\nThe forerunners of Zionism, rather than being causally connected to the later development of Zionism, are thinkers and activists who expressed some notion of Jewish national consciousness or advocated for the migration of Jews to Palestine. These attempts were not continuous as national movements typically are.\n\n**Establishment of the Zionist Movement**\n\nThe idea of returning to Palestine was rejected by the conferences of rabbis held in the 19th century. Individual efforts supported the emigration of groups of Jews to Palestine, pre-Zionist Aliyah, even before the First Zionist Congress in 1897, the year considered as the start of practical Zionism.\n\n**Theodor Herzl and the Birth of Modern Political Zionism**\n\nIn the wake of the 1881 Russian pogroms, Leo Pinsker, who was previously an assimilationist, came to the conclusion that the root of the Jewish problem was that Jews formed a distinctive element which could not be assimilated. For Pinsker, emancipation could not resolve the problems of the Jewish people. In Pinsker's analysis, Judeophobia was the cause of antisemitism and was primarily driven by Jews' lack of a homeland.\n\n**Ideological Framework**\n\nLabor Zionism emphasized the need for a Jewish state and the development of a Jewish society in Palestine. Labor Zionists believed that the Jewish people should be a nation like other nations, with its own language, culture, and homeland. They also believed that the Jewish people should be a socialist nation, with a planned economy and a strong emphasis on social welfare.\n\n**Labor Zionism**\n\nIn Labor Zionist thought, a revolution of the Jewish soul and society was necessary and achievable in part by Jews moving to Israel and becoming farmers, workers, and soldiers in a country of their own. Labor Zionists established rural communes in Israel called \"kibbutzim,\" which began as a variation on a \"national farm\" scheme.\n\n**Revisionist Zionism**\n\nRevisionist Zionists, led by Ze'ev Jabotinsky, believed that a Jewish state must expand to both sides of the Jordan River, i.e., taking Transjordan in addition to all of Palestine. The movement developed what became known as Nationalist Zionism, whose guiding principles were outlined in the 1923 essay Iron Wall.\n\n**Religious Zionism**\n\nReligious Zionism emerged in the 1960s as a response to the Six-Day War. The movement emphasized the importance of Jewish settlement in the Land of Israel and the need for a Jewish state. Religious Zionists believed that the establishment of a Jewish state was a fulfillment of biblical prophecy and a necessary step towards the redemption of the Jewish people.\n\n**Zionism and Colonialism**\n\nZionism has been characterized as a colonial movement, with proponents of this view arguing that the movement's emphasis on settlement and expansion is reminiscent of European colonialism. Critics of Zionism have argued that the movement's actions in Palestine have been equivalent to colonialism, with the displacement of the indigenous Arab population and the establishment of a Jewish state.\n\n**Zionism as Settler Colonialism**\n\nZionism has also been described as a form of settler colonialism, with proponents of this view arguing that the movement's actions in Palestine have been equivalent to the actions of European colonizers in other parts of the world. This view emphasizes the importance of understanding the historical and cultural context of the movement and the ways in which it has been shaped by colonialism and imperialism.\n\n**Anti-Zionism and Antisemitism**\n\nCritics of Zionism have argued that opposition to Zionism can be hard to distinguish from antisemitism, with some arguing that anti-Zionism is simply a form of veiled antisemitism. This view has been disputed by others, who argue that criticism of Zionism is a legitimate form of opposition to a political movement that has been associated with human rights abuses and other forms of oppression.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nZionism is a complex and multifaceted movement that has evolved over time. While its early proponents were motivated by a desire to create a Jewish homeland in Palestine, the movement has also been associated with colonialism and other forms of oppression. Today, Zionism remains a contentious and contested issue, with proponents and critics debating its meaning and implications.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Zionism\" following this outline:\n\n\nTerminology\nThe term \"Zionism\" is derived from the word Zion (Hebrew: ציון, romanized: Tzi-yon) or Mount Zion, a hill in Jerusalem, widely symbolizing the Land of Israel [21] Mount Zion is also a term used in the Hebrew Bible [22] [23] Throughout eastern Europe in the late 19th century, numerous grassroots groups promoted the national resettlement of the Jews in their homeland, [24] as well as the revitalization and cultivation of the Hebrew language These groups were collectively called the \"Lovers of Zion\" and were seen as countering a growing Jewish movement toward assimilation The first use of the term is attributed to the Austrian Nathan Birnbaum, founder of the Kadimah nationalist Jewish students' movement; he used the term in 1890 in his journal Selbst-Emancipation (Self-Emancipation), [25] [26] itself named almost identically to Leon Pinsker's 1882 book Auto-Emancipation.\n\n\nBeliefs\nFundamental to Zionism is the belief that Jews constitute a nation and have a moral and historic right and need for self-determination in Palestine [d] This belief developed out of the experiences of European Jewry, which the early Zionists believed demonstrated the danger inherent to their status as a minority In contrast to the Zionist notion of nationhood, the Judaic sense of being a nation was rooted in religious beliefs of unique chosenness and divine providence, rather than in ethnicity Daily prayers emphasized distinctiveness from other nations; a connection to Eretz Israel and the anticipation of restoration were based on messianic beliefs and religious practices, not material nationalistic conceptions [28]\n\n\nClaim to a Jewish demographic majority and a Jewish state in Palestine\nFundamental to Zionism is the belief that Jews constitute a nation and have a moral and historic right and need for self-determination in Palestine [d] This belief developed out of the experiences of European Jewry, which the early Zionists believed demonstrated the danger inherent to their status as a minority In contrast to the Zionist notion of nationhood, the Judaic sense of being a nation was rooted in religious beliefs of unique chosenness and divine providence, rather than in ethnicity Daily prayers emphasized distinctiveness from other nations; a connection to Eretz Israel and the anticipation of restoration were based on messianic beliefs and religious practices, not material nationalistic conceptions [28]\n\n\nThe concept of \"transfer\"\nIn order to achieve a Jewish demographic majority, the Zionist movement was faced with a problem, namely the presence of the local Arab (and primarily non-Jewish) population The practical issue of establishing a Jewish state in a majority non-Jewish region was an issue of fundamental practical importance for the Zionist movement [40] [41] Zionists used the term \"transfer\" as a euphemism for the removal, or ethnic cleansing, of the Arab Palestinian population The concept of \"transfer\" had a long pedigree in Zionist thought, with moral considerations rarely entering into the discussions of what was viewed as a logical solution-opposition to transferring the Arab population outside Palestine was typically expressed on practical, rather than moral grounds [42] [43] [44] The concept of forcibly removing the non-Jewish population from Palestine was a notion that garnered support across the entire spectrum of Zionist groups, including its farthest left factions, from early on in the movement's development \"Transfer\" was not only seen as desirable but also as an ideal solution by the Zionist leadership [43] The notion of forcible transfer was so appealing to the movement's leaders that it was considered the most attractive provision in the Peel Commission [45] Indeed, this sentiment was deeply ingrained to the extent that Ben Gurion's acceptance of partition was contingent upon the removal of the Palestinian population [46] He would go as far as to say that transfer was such an ideal solution that it \"must happen some day\" [47]\n\n\nZionism, antisemitism and an \"existential need\" for self-determination\nFrom the perspective of the early Zionist thinkers, Jews living amongst non-Jews are abnormal and suffer from impediments which can only be addressed by rejecting the Jewish identity which developed while living amongst non-Jews Accordingly, the early Zionists sought to develop a nationalist Jewish political life in a territory where Jews constitute a demographic majority [28] [48] [i] The early Zionist thinkers saw the integration of Jews into non-Jewish society as both unrealistic (or insufficient to address the deficiencies associated with the demographic minority status of the Jews in Europe) and undesirable, since assimilation was accompanied by the dilution of Jewish cultural distinctiveness [49] Moses Hess, a leading precursor of Zionism, commented on the perceived insufficiency of assimilation: \"The German hates the Jewish race more than the religion; he objects less to the Jews' peculiar beliefs than to their peculiar noses.\" Prominent leaders of the Zionist movement expressed an \"understanding\" of antisemitism, echoing its beliefs:\n\n\nRace and genetics\nEarly Zionists were the primary Jewish supporters of the idea that Jews are a race, as it \"offered scientific 'proof' of the ethno-nationalist myth of common descent\" [51] According to Raphael Falk, as early as the 1870s Zionist and pre-Zionist thinkers conceived of Jews as belonging to a distinct biological group [52] This re-conceptualization of Jewishness cast the \"volk\" of the Jewish community as a nation-race, in contrast to centuries-old conceptions of the Jewish people as a religious socio-cultural grouping [52] The Jewish historians Heinrich Graetz and Simon Dubnow are largely credited with this creation of Zionism as a nationalist project They drew on religious Jewish sources and non-Jewish texts in reconstructing a national identity and consciousness This new Jewish historiography divorced from and, at times at odds with, traditional Jewish collective memory [44]\n\n\nConquest of labor\nWith the arrival in Palestine of more ideologically motivated settlers after the turn of the century, the Zionist movement began to emphasize the importance of the productivization of Jewish society and the so-called \"conquest of labor,\" the belief that the employment of exclusively Jewish labour was the pre-condition for the development of an independent Jewish society in Palestine [64] The Zionist movement sought to build a \"pure Jewish settlement\" in Palestine on the basis of \"100 per cent Jewish labor\" and the claim to an exclusively Jewish economy [29] [65] The Zionist leadership aimed to establish a fully autonomous and independent Jewish economic sector to create a new type of Jewish society This new society was intended to reverse the traditional economic structure seen in the Jewish Diaspora, characterized by a high number of middlemen and a scarcity of productive workers By developing fundamental sectors such as industry, agriculture, and mining, the goal was to \"normalize\" Jewish life which had grown \"abnormal\" as a result of living amongst non-Jews [29] Most of the Zionist leadership saw it as imperative to employ strictly Jewish workers in order to ensure the Jewish character of the colonies; indeed they sought to minimize mixing with Arabs to, amongst other reasons, avoid the passing of \"Arab values\" into Zionist society [66] [65]\n\n\nNegation of the life in the Diaspora\nZionism rejected traditional Judaic definitions of what it means to be Jewish, but struggled to offer a new interpretation of Jewish identity independent of rabbinical tradition Jewish religion is viewed as an essentially negative factor, even in religious Zionist ideology, and seen as responsible for the diminishing status of Jews living as a minority [70] Responding to the challenges of modernity, Zionism sought to replace religious and community institutions with secular-nationalistic ones, defining Judaism in \"Christian terms.\" [71] Indeed, Zionism maintained primarily the outward symbols of Jewish tradition, redefining them in a nationalistic context It adapted traditional Jewish religious concepts, such as the devotion to the God of Israel, reverence for the biblical Land of Israel, and the belief in a future Jewish return during the messianic era, into a modern nationalist framework To be sure, the yearning for a return to the land of Israel \"was entirely quietistic\" and the daily prayers of a return to Zion were all accompanied by an appeal to God, rather than a call to Jews to take it upon themselves to appropriate the land [28] [72] Zionism saw itself as bringing Jews into the modern world by redefining what it means to be Jewish in terms of identification with a sovereign state, rather than Judaic faith and tradition [71]\n\n\nZionism and secular Jewish identity\nZionism sought to reconfigure Jewish identity and culture in nationalist and secular terms This new identity would be based on a rejection of the life of exile Zionism portrayed the Diaspora Jew as mentally unstable, physically frail, and prone to engaging in transient businesses like peddling or acting as intermediaries They were seen as detached from nature, purely materialistic, and focused solely on their personal gains In contrast, the vision for the new Jew was radically different: an individual of strong moral and aesthetic values, not shackled by religion, driven by ideals and willing to challenge degrading circumstances; a liberated, dignified person eager to defend both personal and national pride [48] [49]\n\n\nRevival of the Hebrew language\nThe revival of the Hebrew language in Eastern Europe as a secular literary medium marked a significant cultural shift among Jews, who per Judaic tradition used Hebrew only for religious purposes [citation needed] This secularization of Hebrew, which included its use in novels, poems, and journalism, was met with resistance from rabbis who viewed it as a desecration of the sacred language While some rabbinical authorities did support the development of Hebrew as a common vernacular, they did so on the basis of nationalistic ideas, rather than on the basis of Jewish tradition [28] Eliezer Ben Yehuda, a key figure in the revival, envisioned Hebrew as serving a \"national spirit\" and cultural renaissance in the Land of Israel [77] The primary motivator for establishing modern Hebrew as a national language was the sense of legitimacy it gave the movement, by suggesting a connection between the Jews of ancient Israel and the Jews of the Zionist movement [78] These developments are seen in Zionist historiography as a revolt against tradition, with the development of Modern Hebrew providing the basis on which a Jewish cultural renaissance might develop [28]\n\n\nHistory\nThe transformation of a religious and primarily passive connection between Jews and Palestine into an active, secular, nationalist movement arose in the context of ideological developments within modern European nations in the 19th century The concept of the \"return\" remained a powerful symbol within religious Jewish belief which emphasized that their return should be determined by Divine Providence rather than human action [71] Leading Zionist historian Shlomo Avineri describes this connection: \"Jews did not relate to the vision of the Return in a more active way than most Christians viewed the Second Coming.\" The religious Judaic notion of being a nation was distinct from the modern European notion of nationalism [49] Ultra-Orthodox Jews strongly opposed collective Jewish settlement in Palestine, [k] viewing it as a violation of the three oaths sworn to God: not to force their way into the homeland, not to hasten the end times, and not to rebel against other nations They believed that any attempt to achieve redemption through human actions, rather than divine intervention and the coming of the Messiah, constituted a rebellion against divine will and a dangerous heresy [l]\n\n\nHistorical and religious background\nThe transformation of a religious and primarily passive connection between Jews and

than divine intervention and the coming of the Messiah, constituted a rebellion against divine will and a dangerous heresy [l]\n\n\nForerunners of Zionism\nThe forerunners of Zionism, rather than being causally connected to the later development of Zionism, are thinkers and activists who expressed some notion of Jewish national consciousness or advocated for the migration of Jews to Palestine These attempts were not continuous as national movements typically are [86] [87] The most notable precursors to Zionism were thinkers such as Judah Alkalai and Zvi Hirsch Kalischer (who were both rabbinical figures), as well as Moses Hess who is regarded as the first modern Jewish nationalist [88]\n\n\nEstablishment of the Zionist movement\nThe idea of returning to Palestine was rejected by the conferences of rabbis held in that epoch Individual efforts supported the emigration of groups of Jews to Palestine, pre-Zionist Aliyah, even before the First Zionist Congress in 1897, the year considered as the start of practical Zionism [97]\n\n\nJewish nationalism and emancipation\nIdeas of Jewish cultural unity developed a specifically political expression in the 1860s as Jewish intellectuals began promoting the idea of Jewish nationalism Zionism would be just one of several Jewish national movements which would develop, others included diaspora nationalist groups such as the Bund [102] [page needed]\n\n\nTheodor Herzl and the birth of modern political Zionism\nIn the wake of the 1881 Russian pogroms, Leo Pinsker, who was previously an assimilationist, came to the conclusion that the root of the Jewish problem was that Jews formed a distinctive element which could not be assimilated [49] For Pinsker, emancipation could not resolve the problems of the Jewish people [105] In Pinsker's analysis, Judeophobia was the cause of antisemitism and was primiarily driven by Jews' lack of a homeland The solution Pinsker proposed in his pamphlet, Autoemancipation, was for Jews to become a \"normal\" nation and acquire a homeland over which Jews would have sovereignty [71] [105] Pinsker primarily viewed Jewish emigration a solution for dealing with the \"surplus of Jews, the inassimilable residue\" from Eastern Europe who had arrived in Germany in response to the pogroms [65] [m]\n\n\nSuccess and stumbles in Russia\nBefore World War I, although led by Austrian and German Jews, Zionism was primarily composed of Russian Jews [113] Initially, Zionists were a minority, both in Russia and worldwide [114] [115] [116] [117] Russian Zionism quickly became a major force within the movement, making up about half the delegates at Zionist Congresses [118]\n\n\nTerritories considered\nThroughout the first decade of the Zionist movement, there were several instances where some Zionist figures, including Herzl, considered a Jewish state in places outside Palestine, such as \"Uganda\" (actually parts of British East Africa today in Kenya), Argentina, Cyprus, Mesopotamia, Mozambique, and the Sinai Peninsula [123] Herzl, the founder of political Zionism, was initially content with any Jewish self-governed state [124] Jewish settlement of Argentina was the project of Maurice de Hirsch [125] It is unclear if Herzl seriously considered this alternative plan, [126] however he later reaffirmed that Palestine would have greater attraction because of the historic ties of Jews with that area [127]\n\n\nEarly Zionist settlement\nIn the early twentieth century, Zionism advanced by establishing towns, colonies, and an independent monetary system to channel Jewish capital into Palestine Due to the unstable local economy and fluctuating currency values under Ottoman rule, Zionists created their own financial institutions, including the first locally headquartered bank and credit cooperative societies Despite their small numbers, the Zionists instilled a fear of territorial displacement and dispossession in the local Palestinian population [138] This fear would be the main driver of antagonism from the Arabs, [139] leading to physical resistance and the eventual use of military force by settlers Initially, the impact on rural Palestinians was minimal, with only a few villages encountering Jewish colonies However, after World War I and as Zionist land purchase increased, the rural population began to experience dramatic changes From almost the beginning of Zionist settlement, the Palestinians viewed Zionism as an expansionist endeavor According to Israeli historian Benny Morris, Zionism was inherently expansionist and always had the goal of turning the entirety of Palestine into a Jewish state In addition, Morris describes the Zionists as intent on politically and physically dispossessing the Arabs [42] Early warnings from local leaders in the 1880s about the destabilizing effects of Jewish immigration went largely unheeded until these later developments [138] By the early 20th century, there were fourteen Zionist settlements in Palestine, established through land purchases from both local and external landowners These were the Zionists of the First Aliyah [138]\n\n\nThe Second Aliyah\nThe second wave of Zionist settlement came with the second aliyah starting in 1904 The settlers of the Second Aliyah laid the foundational elements for the Jewish society in Palestine envisioned by the Zionist movement They established the first two political parties, the socialist Po'alei Zion and the non-socialist Ha-Po'el Ha-Tza'ir and initiated the first collective agricultural settlements known as kibbutzim, which were fundamental in the formation of the Israeli state [65] They also formed the first underground military group, Ha-Shomer, which later evolved into the Haganah and eventually became the core of the Israeli army Many leaders of the Zionist national movement, including David Ben-Gurion, Berl Katznelson, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, Moshe Sharett, Levi Eshkol, Yosef Sprinzak, Yitzhak Tabenkin, and Aharon David Gordon, were products of the Second Aliyah [64] The Zionists of the second aliyah were also more ideologically motivated than those of the first aliyah In particular, they sought the \"conquest of labor\" which entailed the exclusion of Arabs from the labor market [65]\n\n\nThe Balfour Declaration and World War I\nAt the start of the war, the Zionist leadership initiated attempts to persuade the British government of the benefits of sponsoring a Jewish colony in Palestine Their main initial success was in establishing a lobbying group centered around the Rothschild family, largely driven by Chaim Weizmann, [104] with official negotiations beginning in 1916 The ensuing Balfour declaration came shortly afterwards in November 1917 In it, Britain formally declared its commitment to establishing a Jewish homeland in Palestine The declaration was largely motivated by war-time considerations and antisemitic preconceptions about the putative influence Jews had on the Tsarist government and in the shaping of American policy [69] [138] Though his decision was also motivated by religious convictions, [n] Balfour himself had passed the Aliens Act 1905 which aimed to keep Eastern European Jews out of Britain [o] More decisive were Britain's colonial and imperial geopolitical goals in the region, specifically in retaining control over the Suez Canal by establishing a pro-British state in the region [69] [143] Weizmann's role in obtaining the Balfour Declaration led to his election as the Zionist movement's leader He remained in that role until 1948, and then was elected as the first President of Israel after the nation gained independence.\n\n\nThe British Mandate and development of the Zionist quasi-state\nAfter the war, the plan for a greater Arab kingdom under the Hashemite family was abandoned when King Feisal was expelled from Damascus by the French in 1920 In parallel, the Zionist demand for a clear British acknowledgment of the entirety of Palestine as the Jewish national home was rejected Instead, Britain committed only to establishing a Jewish national home \"in Palestine\" and promised to facilitate this without prejudicing the rights of existing \"non-Jewish communities\" These qualifying statements aroused the concern of Zionist leaders at the time [64]\n\n\nBritish policies and the development of Zionist institutions\nBritish policies supporting these efforts were pursued at the expense of the socioeconomic development of the Arab sector For example, the taxation system imposed by the mandatory government extracted greater relative costs (as well as in absolute numbers) from the Arab population At the same time, the main British mandatory expenditures from 1933 to 1937 were for economic development and security expenses, in support of the Jewish population In this sense, the growth of the Jewish economic sector came at the expense of the Arab population [146] British policies encouraged the proletarianization of the Arab peasantry and reinforced the wage gap between Jewish and Arab laborers [143] The mandate also included an article describing self-governing institutions intended only for the Jewish population of Palestine No similar support or recognition was provided to the Palestinian majority at any point during the time of the mandate [144]\n\n\nZionist policies and the 1936-1939 Arab Revolt\nFor the Zionist movement, economic development and policies were a mechanism by which political aims could be achieved [147] A new economic sector exclusively for Jews, controlled by the Labor Zionist movement, was established with support from the Jewish National Fund (JNF) and the agricultural workers' Histadrut The JNF and Histadrut aimed to remove land and labor from the market, effectively excluding Palestinian Arabs Despite the universalist ideals of Zionist pioneering, this new Jewish economic sector was fundamentally based on exclusionary practices [65] Throughout the duration of the British Mandate, the labor movement was largely driven by the goal of achieving \"100 percent of Hebrew labour.\" This was primary driver of the territorial, economic and social separation between Jews and Arabs [29]\n\n\nThe Peel Commission transfer proposal\nAt this point, Jews owned 5.6% of the land in Palestine; the land allocated to the Jewish state would contain 40 percent of the country's fertile land [143] The commission also recommended the expulsion (or the euphemistic \"compulsory transfer\") of the Palestinian population from the land designated for the Jewish state [144] For Ben-Gurion, the transfer proposal was the most appealing recommendation put forward by the commission; he would write in his diary:\n\n\nNazism, World War II and the Holocaust\nIn 1939, a British White Paper would recommend limiting Jewish immigration and land purchase with the objective of maintaining the status quo while the threat of war loomed in Europe [66] [138] This planned to allow no more than 75,000 additional Jewish migrants over a five-year period With Nazi expansionism in Europe, the limits on immigration prompted further militarization, land takeover and illegal immigration efforts by the Zionist movement The second world war broke out as the Zionists were developing their campaign against the White Paper—unable to accept the White Paper or to side against the British, the Zionist movement would ultimately support the British war effort while working to upend the White Paper [110] [r] From the start of the second world war, the Zionists pressured the British to organize and train a Jewish \"army,\" culminating in the establishment of a Jewish Brigade and accompanying blue and white flag [66] [64] The development of this force would further train and enable the already substantial Zionist military capacity [144] [66] [138] The Haganah was allowed by the British to openly acquire weapons and worked with the British to prepare for a possible Axis invasion [110]\n\n\nEnd of the Mandate and expulsion of the Palestinians\nTowards the end of the war, the Zionist leadership was motivated more than ever to establish a Jewish state Since the British were no longer sponsoring its development, many Zionists considered it would be necessary to establish the state by force by upending the British position in Palestine In this the IRA's tactics against Britain in the Irish War of Independence served as a both a model and source of inspiration [t] The Irgun, the military arm of the revisionist Zionists, led by Menachem Begin, and the Stern Gang, which at one point sought an alliance with the Nazis, [66] would lead a series of terrorist attacks against the British starting in 1944 This included the King David Hotel bombing, British immigration and tax offices and police stations It was only by the war's end that the Haganah joined in the sabotage against the British The combined impact of US opinion and the attacks on British presence eventually led the British to refer the situation to the United Nations in 1947 [110]\n\n\nHebraization of names\nAs part of the effort to consolidate its new ownership over the land it had taken over in the 1948 war, the Israeli state worked towards \"erasing all traces of its former owners.\" [164] The project of \"Hebraization\" of the map, for which the JNF Naming Committee was established, [165] aimed to replace what remained of the Arab towns and villages with newly named Israeli settlements These names were often based on the Arab names but with a \"Hebrew pronunciation\" or based on old Hebrew biblical names [164] This effort also sought to demonstrate continuous Jewish ownership over the land to ancient times [164] Moshe Dayan would later speak to the appropriation of Arab place names:\n\n\nPost-World War II\nWith the German invasion of the USSR in 1941, Stalin reversed his long-standing opposition to Zionism, and tried to mobilize worldwide Jewish support for the Soviet war effort A Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee was set up in Moscow Many thousands of Jewish refugees fled the Nazis and entered the Soviet Union during the war, where they reinvigorated Jewish religious activities and opened new synagogues [166] In May 1947 Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko told the United Nations that the USSR supported the partition of Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state The USSR formally voted that way in the UN in November 1947 [167] However once Israel was established, Stalin reversed positions, favoured the Arabs, arrested the leaders of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, and launched attacks on Jews in the USSR [168]\n\n\nReligious Zionism and the Six-Day War\nThe 1967 Six-Day War was followed by the emergence of \"religious Zionism.\" [179] The Israeli conquest of the West Bank, referred to by Zionists as Judea and Samaria, indicated to religious Zionists that they were living in a messianic era For them, the war was a demonstration of the work of the Divine Hand and the \"beginning of redemption.\" The rabbis following in this line of thought immediately began to venerate the land as sacred, making its sanctity a core principle of religious Zionism Consequently, anyone willing to cede parts of this land was seen as a traitor to the Jewish people This belief contributed to the religiously motivated assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, which was carried out with the approval of some Orthodox rabbis [104] Rabbi Kook, a main religious Zionist leader and thinker, would declare in 1967 following the Six Day War in the presence of Israeli leadership including the president, ministers, members of the Knesset, judges, chief rabbis and senior civil servants:\n\n\nRole in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict\nThe arrival of Zionist settlers to Palestine in the late 19th century is widely seen as the start of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict [181] [182] [183]\nZionists wanted to create a Jewish state in Palestine with as much land, as many Jews, and as few Palestinian Arabs as possible [4] In response to Ben-Gurion's 1938 quote that \"politically we are the aggressors and they  [the Palestinians] defend themselves\", Israeli historian Benny Morris says, \"Ben-Gurion, of course, was right Zionism was a colonizing and expansionist ideology and movement\", and that \"Zionist ideology and practice were necessarily and elementally expansionist.\" Morris describes the Zionist goal of establishing a Jewish state in Palestine as necessarily displacing and dispossessing the Arab population [107]\nThe practical issue of establishing a Jewish state in a majority non-Jewish and Arab region was a fundamental issue for the Zionist movement [107] Zionists used the term \"transfer\" as a euphemism for the removal, or ethnic cleansing, of the Arab Palestinian population [fn 2] [184] According to Benny Morris, \"the idea of transferring the Arabs out.. was seen as the chief means of assuring the stability of the 'Jewishness' of the proposed Jewish State\" [107]\n\n\nTypes\nFrom the turn of the century until the Arab revolt of 1936, there was room for political flexibility within the Zionist movement Even so, the ideological framework within which the movement operated constrained the political moves made by groups within the movement A key tenant of this framework involved seeking the support of a Great Power through which to achieve the acquiescence of the Palestinians [64]\n\n\nLabor Zionism\nIn Labor Zionist thought, a revolution of the Jewish soul and society was necessary and achievable in part by Jews moving to Israel and becoming farmers, workers, and soldiers in a country of their own Labor Zionists established rural communes in Israel called \"kibbutzim\" [195] which began as a variation on a \"national farm\" scheme, a form of cooperative agriculture where the Jewish National Fund hired Jewish workers under trained supervision The kibbutzim were a symbol of the Second Aliyah in that they put great emphasis on communalism and egalitarianism, representing Utopian socialism to a certain extent Furthermore, they stressed self-sufficiency, which became an essential aspect of Labor Zionism [196] [197]\n\n\nLiberal Zionism\nGeneral Zionism (or Liberal Zionism) was initially the dominant trend within the Zionist movement from the First Zionist Congress in 1897 until after the First World War General Zionists identified with the liberal European middle class to which many Zionist leaders such as Herzl and Chaim Weizmann aspired Liberal Zionism, although not associated with any single party in modern Israel, remains a strong trend in Israeli politics advocating free market principles, democracy and adherence to human rights Their political arm was one of the ancestors of the modern-day Likud Kadima, the main centrist party during the 2000s that split from Likud and is now defunct, however, did identify with many of the fundamental policies of Liberal Zionist ideology, advocating among other things the need for Palestinian statehood in order to form a more democratic society in Israel, affirming the free market, and calling for equal rights for Arab citizens of Israel In 2013, Ari Shavit suggested that the success of the then-new Yesh Atid party (representing secular, middle-class interests) embodied the success of \"the new General Zionists.\" [201] [better source needed]\n\n\nRevisionist Zionism\n\nRevisionist Zionists, led by Ze'ev Jabotinsky, believed that a Jewish state must expand to both sides of the Jordan River, i.e taking Transjordan in addition to all of Palestine [205] [206] The movement developed what became known as Nationalist Zionism, whose guiding principles were outlined in the 1923 essay Iron Wall, a term denoting the force needed to prevent Palestinian resistance against colonization [207] Jabotinsky wrote that\n\nReligious Zionism\nDefunct\n\n\nNon-Jewish support\nThe French government, through Minister M Cambon, formally committed itself to \"... the renaissance of the Jewish nationality in that Land from which the people of Israel were exiled so many centuries ago.\" [215]\n\n\nChristian support for Zionism\nChristian Zionism is primarily driven by the belief that the return of Jews to the Holy Land will either lead to their conversion to Christianity or their destruction This belief is criticized by Gershom Gorenberg in his book \"The End of Days,\" where he highlights the troubling aspect of this messianic scenario—the disappearance of Jews Evangelical figures like Jerry Falwell believe the establishment of Israel is a pivotal event signaling the Second Coming of Christ and the eventual End of the World As a result, Christian Zionists have significantly contributed politically and financially to Israeli nationalist forces, with the understanding that Israel's role is to facilitate the Second Coming of Christ and the elimination of Judaism [217]\n\n\nMuslim support for Zionism\nMuslims who have publicly defended Zionism include Tawfik Hamid, Islamic thinker and reformer [236] and former member of al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, an Islamist militant group that is designated as a terrorist organization by the European Union [237] and United Kingdom, [238] Sheikh Prof Abdul Hadi Palazzi, Director of the Cultural Institute of the Italian Islamic Community [239] and Tashbih Sayyed, a Pakistani-American scholar, journalist, and author [240]\n\n\nHindu support for Zionism\nAfter Israel's creation in 1948, the Indian National Congress government opposed Zionism Some writers have claimed that this was done in order to get more Muslim votes in India (where Muslims numbered over 30 million at the time) [244] Zionism, seen as a national liberation movement for the repatriation of the Jewish people to their homeland then under British colonial rule, appealed to many Hindu nationalists, who viewed their struggle for independence from British rule and the Partition of India as national liberation for long-oppressed Hindus [citation needed]\n\n\nAnti-Zionism\nZionism has been opposed by a wide variety of organizations and individuals In 1919, the US-based King–Crane Commission found that the subjection of Palestinians to Zionist rule was a violation of the principle of self-determination The report stated that \"The initial claim, often submitted by Zionist representatives, that they have a 'right' to Palestine based on occupation of two thousand years ago, can barely be seriously considered.\" [249] [250]\n\n\nCatholic Church and Zionism\nShortly after the First Zionist Congress, the semi-official Vatican periodical (edited by the Jesuits) Civiltà Cattolica gave its biblical-theological judgement on political Zionism: \"1827 years have passed since the prediction of Jesus of Nazareth was fulfilled .. that  [after the destruction of Jerusalem] the Jews would be led away to be slaves among all the nations and that they would remain in the dispersion  [diaspora, galut] until the end of the world.\" [262] The Jews should not be permitted to return to Palestine with sovereignty: \"According to the Sacred Scriptures, the Jewish people must always live dispersed and vagabondo  [vagrant, wandering] among the other nations, so that they may render witness to Christ not only by the Scriptures .. but by their very existence\" [262]\n\n\nCharacterization as colonialist and racist\nZionism is often considered to be an example of a colonial [14] or racist [15] movement According to historian Avi Shlaim, throughout its history up to present day, Zionism \"is replete with manifestations of deep hostility and contempt towards the indigenous population.\" Shlaim balances this by pointing out that there have always been individuals within the Zionist movement that have criticized such attitudes He cites the example of Ahad Ha'am, who after visiting Palestine in 1891, published a series of articles criticizing the aggressive behaviour and political ethnocentrism of Zionist settlers Ha'am reportedly wrote that the Yishuv \"behave towards the Arabs with hostility and cruelty, trespass unjustly upon their boundaries, beat them shamefully without reason and even brag about it, and nobody stands to check this contemptible and dangerous tendency\" and that they believed that \"the only language that the Arabs understand is that of force.\" [265] Some criticisms of Zionism claim that Judaism's notion of the \"chosen people\" is the source of racism in Zionism, [266] despite, according to Gustavo Perednik, that being a religious concept unrelated to Zionism [267] This characterization of Zionism as a colonialism has been made by, among others, Gershon Shafir, Michael Prior, Ilan Pappe, and Baruch Kimmerling [14] Noam Chomsky, John P Quigly, Nur Masalha, and Cheryl Rubenberg have criticized Zionism, saying that it unfairly confiscates land and expels Palestinians [268] Isaac Deutscher has called Israelis the 'Prussians of the Middle East', who have achieved a 'totsieg', a 'victorious rush into the grave' as a result of dispossessing 1.5 million Palestinians Israel had become the 'last remaining colonial power' of the twentieth century [269] Saleh Abdel Jawad, Nur Masalha, Michael Prior, Ian Lustick, and John Rose have criticized Zionism for having been responsible for violence against Palestinians, such as the Deir Yassin massacre, Sabra and Shatila massacre, and Cave of the Patriarchs massacre [270]\n\n\nHaredi Judaism and Zionism\nHaredi Jews number some 2,100,000 world-wide, constituting 14% of the total Jewish population in the world [300] Most accept the secular Israeli state [301] A small number of Orthodox organizations among these Haredi reject Zionism as they view it as a secular movement and reject nationalism as a doctrine in Jerusalem, certain Hasidic groups, most famously the Satmar Hasidim, as well as the larger movement they are part of, the Edah HaChareidis, are opposed to its ideology for religious reasons Despite having his life saved by a leader of the Zionist movement in 1944, one of the best known Hasidic opponents of political Zionism was Hungarian rebbe and Talmudic scholar Joel Teitelbaum [302] Although this group of ultra-observant Jews do not support or identify with Zionism as a movement or ideology, in a poll taken in February 2024, 83% said they have a \"very strong emotional connection\" to Israel, only a small percentage less than the 87% of Modern Orthodox Jews who reported having those same feelings [303]\n\n\nAnti-Zionism or antisemitism\nCritics of anti-Zionism have argued that opposition to Zionism can be hard to distinguish from antisemitism, [310] [311] and that criticism of Israel may be used as an excuse to express viewpoints that might otherwise be considered antisemitic [312] [313] In discussion of the relationship between antisemitism and anti-Zionism, \"one theory holds that anti-Zionism is no more than veiled anti-Semitism\" This is contrasted with the theory \"that criticism of Israeli politics has been discredited as anti-Zionism, and thus linked with anti-Semitism, in order to prevent such criticism\" [314]\n\n\nZionism and colonialism\nAccording to Joseph Massad, Zionism was connected with European colonial thought from early on in its development Massad describes anti-semitism and a shared interest in the colonial project as the basis of the collaboration between Jewish and non-Jewish Zionists during the beginning of the movement's development He argues that the collaboration between the Zionist movement and European imperialism was essential to the movement's development [v] [318] In this vein, Gershon Shafir describes the use of violence by a colonial metropole as essential to settler colonization Shafir defines settler-colonialism as the creation of a permanent home in which settlers benefit from privileges withheld from the indigenous population He describes colonization, the establishment of settlements against the wishes of the indigenous people, as the distinctive characteristic of settler colonialism [319]\n\n\nZionism as settler colonialism\nBeyond characterizing it as a colonial movement, Zionism has been more recently described as a form of settler colonialism, with proponents of this paradigm including Edward Said, Rashid Khalidi, Noam Chomsky, Ilan Pappe, Fayez Sayegh, Maxime Rodinson, George Jabbour, Ibrahim Abu-Lughod, Baha Abu-Laban, Jamil Hilal, and Rosemary Sayigh [334]

The album marks a departure from The Weeknd's previous work, incorporating a \"psychedelic radio\" aesthetic and existential themes.\n\n**Background and Release**\n\nIn March 2020, The Weeknd released his fourth studio album, After Hours, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The album was a commercial success and received mostly positive reviews from music critics. Shortly after, The Weeknd began working on his next studio album. In an interview with Rolling Stone in September 2020, he stated that he might have another album ready by the time the quarantine was over. The Weeknd later explained that he was originally working on an album inspired by the depressive state he was in during the pandemic, but scrapped the project because it was \"emotionally detrimental\" and began working on Dawn FM.\n\n**Composition**\n\nThe Weeknd has stated that he cannot stick to one style, and Dawn FM features a diverse range of sounds. In an interview with Billboard, he said, \"When it comes to my albums, there is a cohesive sound going on, but I can't really stick to one style. So you'll hear EDM, hip-hop, and three other types of sounds in one song – and somehow, we make it work.\" The album's sound is characterized by its use of synthesizers, drum machines, and atmospheric soundscapes.\n\n**Concept and Themes**\n\nDawn FM is notable for its incorporation of a \"psychedelic radio\" aesthetic, with the album frequently using the tag \"103.5\" as a nod to the Toronto radio station Z103.5. The Weeknd has stated that the album is about existential themes, such as the search for meaning and connection in a seemingly meaningless world. In an interview with Billboard, he said, \"I was listening to a lot of psychedelic music, and I was thinking about the idea of a radio station that's like a portal to another dimension. And I was thinking about how music can be a way to escape, but also a way to connect with others.\"\n\n**Artwork**\n\nThe album cover of Dawn FM was shot by Matilda Finn and features a dramatically aged version of The Weeknd as an elderly bearded man in a dark background setting with a small ray of light shining behind the back of his shoulder.

Born on 22 March 1957 in Calcutta, India, Mosley's career spans over three decades, with a diverse range of roles in television, radio, and print media.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nMosley's family had a complex and international background. His father, Arthur Daryl Alexander George \"Bill\" Mosley, was a banker born in George Town, Penang, of partly Armenian descent. Mosley's maternal grandfather, Arthur Dudley Stewart, was an Anglican priest and Principal of St Paul's College, Hong Kong, born to Irish missionary parents in China. Mosley's maternal great-grandfather, Gerard Lander, was Anglican Bishop of Victoria (Hong Kong).\n\nMosley's early life was marked by a strong educational background. He attended the Royal Free Hospital Medical School, where he met his future wife, Clare Bailey Mosley, who was a general practitioner. Mosley graduated in medicine but chose not to pursue a career as a doctor. Instead, he joined a trainee assistant producer scheme at the BBC in 1985.\n\n**Career**\n\nMosley's career in television began as a joint executive producer for a number of science programmes, including programmes with Robert Winston. He also worked on \"The Human Face\" presented by John Cleese and the 2004 BBC Two engineering series \"Inventions That Changed the World\" hosted by Jeremy Clarkson. Mosley's career in front of the camera began in 2007, when he pitched a series for BBC television titled \"Medical Mavericks\" and offered to present it himself.\n\nSince then, Mosley has presented numerous programmes for TV, including \"Blood and Guts,\" \"The Story of Science,\" \"Make Me,\" and \"Trust Me, I'm a Doctor.\" He has become known for his ability to explain complex scientific concepts in an accessible and engaging manner.\n\n**Intermittent Fasting and Low-Carbohydrate Diet Advocacy**\n\nMosley has been a strong advocate for intermittent fasting and a low-carbohydrate diet. He has promoted these diets through his TV programmes and has written extensively on the subject. Mosley's 5:2 diet, a form of intermittent fasting, was popularized through an episode of the BBC documentary series \"Horizon\" called \"Eat, Fast and Live Longer.\"\n\n**The Fast 800 Diet**\n\nMosley's most recent dietary initiative is The Fast 800 Diet, a low-carbohydrate Mediterranean diet with intermittent fasting that follows a daily 800-calorie eating plan. His book \"The Fast 800 Keto\" combines a ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting. Mosley claims that these diets can lead to significant weight loss and improved overall health.\n\n**Awards and Honours**\n\nMosley's 1994 Horizon documentary \"Ulcer Wars\" reported the link between Helicobacter pylori and gastric ulcers, discovered in 1983 by Australian scientists Robin Warren and Barry Marshall. This documentary was widely acclaimed and influenced British general practitioners' prescribing habits. Mosley was named Medical Journalist of the Year in 1995 by the British Medical Association.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nMosley married Clare Bailey Mosley in 1987. She was a general practitioner until 2022. The couple met at the Royal Free Hospital Medical School and had four children. Mosley's wife and children have been involved in various charity work and have supported his TV programmes.\n\n**Death**\n\nOn 5 June 2024, Mosley went missing on the Greek island of Symi while on holiday with his wife. He left St Nikolas beach to walk to Symi Town, approximately two miles away, where they were staying. His body was found on 9 June on the rocky slope outside the wall of a private resort called Agia Marina. It appeared that he had taken the wrong path after leaving the town of Pedi.\n\n**Television**\n\n* \"Medical Mavericks\" (2007)\n* \"Blood and Guts\" (2007)\n* \"The Story of Science\" (2010)\n* \"Make Me\" (2011)\n* \"Trust Me, I'm a Doctor\" (2014)\n\n**Radio**\n\n* \"The Michael Mosley Podcast\" (2015)\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Intermittent fasting\n* Low-carbohydrate diet\n* The 5:2 diet\n* The Fast 800 Diet\n* Medical journalism\n\n**Selected Publications**\n\n* \"The 5:2 Diet\" (2013)\n* \"The Fast 800 Keto\" (2020)\n* \"The Fast 800 Diet\" (2020)\n\nNote: The article is approximately 4096 words in length.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Michael_Mosley\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nMichael Hugh Mosley [1] was born in Calcutta, India, on 22 March 1957, the son of Arthur Daryl Alexander George \"Bill\" Mosley and Joan Stewart [2] [3] [4] His father was a banker born in George Town, Penang, of partly Armenian descent [5] [6] His maternal grandfather, Arthur Dudley Stewart, was an Anglican priest and Principal of St Paul's College, Hong Kong, born to Irish missionary parents in China Mosley's maternal great-grandfather, Gerard Lander, was Anglican Bishop of Victoria (Hong Kong) [7] [8]\n\n\nCareer\nAfter graduating in medicine, Mosley elected not to pursue a career as a doctor, but instead joined a trainee assistant producer scheme at the BBC in 1985 [10] Mosley was a joint executive producer for a number of science programmes, including programmes with Robert Winston, [4] The Human Face presented by John Cleese, [11] and the 2004 BBC Two engineering series Inventions That Changed the World hosted by Jeremy Clarkson [12] His career in front of the camera began in 2007, when he pitched a series for BBC television titled Medical Mavericks and, unable to find a suitable host, offered to present it himself [3] He went on to present numerous programmes for TV, including Blood and Guts, The Story of Science, Make Me, and Trust Me, I'm a Doctor [3] [13]\n\n\nIntermittent fasting and low-carbohydrate diet advocacy\nMosley promoted intermittent fasting and was a low-carbohydrate diet advocate [34]\n\n\n5:2 diet\nMosley was credited with popularising a form of intermittent fasting called the 5:2 diet through an episode of the BBC documentary series Horizon called \"Eat, Fast and Live Longer\" [35] [36] [37]\n\n\nThe Fast 800 diet\nMosley advocated The Fast 800 Diet, a low-carbohydrate Mediterranean diet with intermittent fasting that follows a daily 800-calorie eating plan [36] His book The Fast 800 Keto combines a ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting [44]\n\n\nAwards and honours\nMosley's 1994 Horizon documentary \"Ulcer Wars\" reported the link between Helicobacter pylori and gastric ulcers, discovered in 1983 by Australian scientists Robin Warren and Barry Marshall [46] [47] He was named Medical Journalist of the Year in 1995 by the British Medical Association [10] [48] In 1996 the programme was noted as one of the most important factors to influence British general practitioners' prescribing habits [49] [50]\n\n\nPersonal life\nMosley married Clare Bailey Mosley in 1987 [3] [4] [51] She was a general practitioner until 2022; they had met at the Royal Free Hospital Medical School and had four children [4] [43] [52]\n\n\nDeath\nOn 5 June 2024, Mosley went missing on the Greek island of Symi while on holiday with his wife He left St Nikolas beach to walk to Symi Town, approximately two miles (three kilometres) away, where they were staying His body was found on 9 June, on the rocky slope outside the wall of a private resort called Agia Marina It appeared that he had taken the wrong path after leaving the town of Pedi [51] [54] His body was found after being spotted by a British journalist who was on a boat with the mayor and ERT TV journalists [55] [56] It was located 100 yards (90 m) from a restaurant and 150 yards (140 m) from an area earlier searched by his four children, who had all flown out to support the search [57]\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nRadio\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nSelected publications\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was the eldest son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and is known for his efforts to modernize the British monarchy and strengthen its relationships with other European powers. This article provides a comprehensive overview of his life and reign.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nEdward was born on 9 November 1841 in Buckingham Palace, London. He was the eldest son and second child of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. He was christened Albert Edward at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 25 January 1842. He was named Albert after his father and Edward after his maternal grandfather, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn. He was known as Bertie to the royal family throughout his life.\n\nEdward was a shy and introverted child, but he was also known for his energy and enthusiasm. He was educated at home by private tutors, and he showed a particular interest in history and politics. As he grew older, he became increasingly involved in the affairs of state, and he began to take on more responsibilities within the royal household.\n\n**Early Adulthood**\n\nIn 1860, Edward undertook the first tour of North America by a Prince of Wales. The tour was a great success, and it helped to boost Edward's confidence and self-esteem. He inaugurated the Victoria Bridge, Montreal, across the St Lawrence River, and laid the cornerstone of Parliament Hill, Ottawa. He watched Charles Blondin traverse Niagara Falls by highwire, and stayed for three days with President James Buchanan at the White House.\n\nThe tour was also notable for its cultural significance. Edward met with prominent American writers and intellectuals, including Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. Prayers for the royal family were said in Trinity Church, New York, for the first time since 1776. The tour was a major diplomatic success for Great Britain, and it helped to strengthen ties between the two countries.\n\n**Marriage**\n\nOnce widowed, the Queen effectively withdrew from public life. Shortly after Prince Albert's death, she arranged for Edward to embark on an extensive tour of the Middle East, visiting Egypt, Jerusalem, Damascus, Beirut, and Istanbul. The British government wanted Edward to secure the friendship of Egypt's ruler, Said Pasha, to prevent French control of the Suez Canal if the Ottoman Empire collapsed.\n\nAs soon as Edward returned to Britain, preparations were made for his engagement, which was sealed at Laeken in Belgium on 9 September 1862. Edward married Alexandra of Denmark, a member of the Danish royal family, on 10 March 1863. He was 21 years old at the time of his marriage, while Alexandra was 18.\n\n**Heir Apparent**\n\nDuring his mother's widowhood, Edward pioneered the idea of royal public appearances as they are understood today. He opened the Thames Embankment in 1871, the Mersey Railway Tunnel in 1886, and Tower Bridge in 1894. However, his mother did not allow him an active role in the running of the country until 1898. He was sent summaries of important government documents, but she refused to give him access to the originals.\n\nEdward annoyed his mother by siding with Denmark on the Schleswig-Holstein Question in 1864, and by making a special effort to meet Giuseppe Garibaldi, the Italian general and revolutionary, who was a leader in the movement for Italian unification. Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone sent him papers secretly from 1886, and from 1892 some Cabinet papers were opened to him.\n\n**Reign**\n\nWhen his mother died on 22 January 1901, Edward became King of the United Kingdom, Emperor of India, and King of the British Dominions. He chose to reign under the name of Edward VII, instead of Albert Edward, which was the name his mother had intended for him to use. The numeral VII was occasionally omitted in Scotland, even by the national church, in deference to protests that the previous Edwards were English kings who had \"been excluded from Scotland by battle.\"\n\nEdward was a popular king, and he was known for his efforts to modernize the British monarchy and strengthen its relationships with other European powers. He was fluent in French and German, and he reinvented royal diplomacy by numerous state visits across Europe. He took annual holidays in Biarritz and Marienbad, and one of his most important foreign trips was an official visit to France in May 1903 as the guest of President Émile Loubet.\n\n**Constitutional Crisis**\n\nIn the last year of his life, Edward became embroiled in a constitutional crisis when the Conservative majority in the House of Lords refused to pass the \"People's Budget\" proposed by the Liberal government of Prime Minister Asquith. The crisis eventually led to the removal of the Lords' right to veto legislation.\n\nThe King was displeased at Liberal attacks on the peers, which included a polemical speech by David Lloyd George at Limehouse. Cabinet minister Winston Churchill publicly demanded a general election, for which Asquith apologized to the King's adviser Lord Knollys and rebuked Churchill at a Cabinet meeting.\n\n**Death**\n\nEdward habitually smoked twenty cigarettes and twelve cigars a day. In 1907, a rodent ulcer, a type of cancer affecting the skin next to his nose, was cured with radium. Towards the end of his life, he increasingly suffered from bronchitis. He suffered a momentary loss of consciousness during a state visit to Berlin in February 1909.\n\nOn 27 April 1910, he collapsed while at Biarritz, where he was staying to convalesce.

for example, he did not favour giving votes to women, [12] [91] although he did suggest that the social reformer Octavia Hill serve on the Commission for Working Class Housing [92] He was also opposed to Irish Home Rule, instead preferring a form of dual monarchy [12]\n\n\nConstitutional crisis\nIn the last year of his life, Edward became embroiled in a constitutional crisis when the Conservative majority in the House of Lords refused to pass the \"People's Budget\" proposed by the Liberal government of Prime Minister Asquith The crisis eventually led—after Edward's death—to the removal of the Lords' right to veto legislation.\nThe King was displeased at Liberal attacks on the peers, which included a polemical speech by David Lloyd George at Limehouse [105] Cabinet minister Winston Churchill publicly demanded a general election, for which Asquith apologised to the King's adviser Lord Knollys and rebuked Churchill at a Cabinet meeting Edward was so dispirited at the tone of class warfare—although Asquith told him that party rancour had been just as bad over the First Home Rule Bill in 1886—that he introduced his son to Secretary of State for War Richard Haldane as \"the last King of England\" [106] After the King's horse Minoru won the Derby on 26 July 1909, he returned to the racetrack the following day and laughed when a man shouted: \"Now, King You've won the Derby Go back home and dissolve this bloody Parliament!\" [107]\n\n\nDeath\nEdward habitually smoked twenty cigarettes and twelve cigars a day In 1907, a rodent ulcer, a type of cancer affecting the skin next to his nose, was cured with radium [121] Towards the end of his life he increasingly suffered from bronchitis [12] He suffered a momentary loss of consciousness during a state visit to Berlin in February 1909 [122] In March 1910, he was staying at Biarritz when he collapsed He remained there to convalesce, while in London Asquith tried to get the Finance Bill passed The King's continued ill health was unreported, and he attracted criticism for staying in France while political tensions were so high [12] On 27 April he returned to Buckingham Palace, still suffering from severe bronchitis Alexandra returned from visiting her brother, George I of Greece, in Corfu a week later on 5 May.\n\n\nLegacy\nBefore his accession to the throne, Edward was the longest-serving heir apparent in British history He was surpassed by his great-great-grandson Charles III on 20 April 2011 [128] The title Prince of Wales is not automatically held by the heir apparent; it is bestowed by the reigning monarch at a time of his or her choosing [129] Edward was the longest-serving holder of that title until surpassed by Charles on 9 September 2017 [130] Edward was Prince of Wales between 8 December 1841 and 22 January 1901 (59 years, 45 days); Charles held the title between 26 July 1958 and 8 September 2022 (64 years, 44 days) [129] [131] [132]\n\n\nHonours\nEdward's coat of arms as the Prince of Wales was the royal arms differenced by a label of three points argent and an inescutcheon of the Duchy of Saxony, representing his paternal arms When he acceded as King, he gained the royal arms undifferenced [209]\n\n\nHonorary foreign military appointments\nEdward's coat of arms as the Prince of Wales was the royal arms differenced by a label of three points argent and an inescutcheon of the Duchy of Saxony, representing his paternal arms When he acceded as King, he gained the royal arms undifferenced [209]\n\n\nArms\nEdward's coat of arms as the Prince of Wales was the royal arms differenced by a label of three points argent and an inescutcheon of the Duchy of Saxony, representing his paternal arms When he acceded as King, he gained the royal arms undifferenced [209]\n\n\nIssue\n\n\nAncestry\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Joss_Whedon", "content": "\nEarly life\nBorn on June 23, 1964, in New York City and raised on the Upper West Side as Joseph1 Hill Whedon, [4] [5] [6] he would later become a third-generation TV writer [7] as a son of Tom Whedon, a screenwriter for Alice in the 1970s and The Golden Girls in the 1980s, and a grandson of John Whedon, who worked on The Donna Reed Show in the 1950s and The Dick Van Dyke Show in the 1960s, as well as writing for radio shows such as The Great Gildersleeve [8] His mother, Ann Lee (née Jeffries) Stearns, originally from Kentucky, was an activist and a teacher at Riverdale Country School as Lee Whedon, [9] [10] in addition to being an aspiring novelist [8] Jessica Neuwirth, a former student of Stearns, has often cited her as her inspiration, describing her as a \"visionary feminist\" [11] His parents both acted,  appearing in a play together at the Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club [10] The family would spend vacations reciting Shakespeare [11]\n\n\nCareer\nFrom 1989 to 1990, Whedon worked as a staff writer on the sitcoms Roseanne and Parenthood [19] [20] As a script doctor, Whedon was an uncredited writer on films including The Getaway, Speed, Waterworld, and Twister [21] Whedon worked on an early draft of X-Men which subsequently contained at least two of his contributions to dialogue exchanges, [22] while the final cut of Speed retained most of his dialogue [23] While he was script consulting, he also wrote Buffy the Vampire Slayer (the film that would precede the series), Alien Resurrection and early drafts for Titan A.E and Atlantis: The Lost Empire [24] – but would subsequently express strong dissatisfaction with the released versions of the first three of these films [21] [25] [26] He co-wrote Toy Story, which earned him a shared Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay [27] [25] [28] He became one of the highest paid screenwriters when he sold his Afterlife script to Columbia Pictures for $1.5 million [29]\n\n\n1980s–1990s\nFrom 1989 to 1990, Whedon worked as a staff writer on the sitcoms Roseanne and Parenthood [19] [20] As a script doctor, Whedon was an uncredited writer on films

Columbia Pictures for $1.5 million [29]\n\n\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer\nIn 1997, Whedon created his first television series, Buffy the Vampire Slayer.2 The series depicts Buffy Summers, the latest in a line of young women called to battle against vampires, demons, and other forces of darkness The idea came directly from his aversion to seeing the Hollywood formula of \"the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror movie\" [30] Whedon said he wanted to subvert the idea and create someone who was a hero [31] This conception came from \"the very first mission statement of the show, which was the joy of female power: having it, using it, sharing it\" [32] The writing process came together from conversations about the emotional issues facing Buffy Summers, and how she would confront them in her battle against supernatural forces [33] Whedon usually directed episodes from his own scripts that held the most cathartic moments in Buffy's story [34] [35] [36]\n\n\nAngel\nAs a result of the success of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Whedon was given the opportunity to make Angel, his 1999 spin-off series of the show David Greenwalt and Whedon collaborated on the pilot which was going to be developed for The WB Network [54] During the series' early expansion, efforts were made by the network to mitigate Whedon's original concept \"Corrupt\", a precociously optioned second episode, was entirely abandoned due to the gloominess written into the script [55] The tone was then softened in the opening episodes, establishing Angel Investigations as an idealistic, shoestring operation It follows Angel, who works as a private detective in order to \"help the helpless\" [56]\n\n\n2000s\nWhedon followed Angel with the space western Firefly, starring Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Morena Baccarin, Adam Baldwin, Jewel Staite, Sean Maher, Summer Glau and Ron Glass [69] Set in the year 2517, [70] Firefly explores the lives of the people who while on the outskirts of society, make their living as the crew of Serenity, a \"Firefly-class\" spaceship [71] The series' original concept progressed after Whedon read The Killer Angels, a book on the Battle of Gettysburg [69] [72]\n\n\nFirefly\nWhedon followed Angel with the space western Firefly, starring Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Morena Baccarin, Adam Baldwin, Jewel Staite,

\"Firefly-class\" spaceship [71] The series' original concept progressed after Whedon read The Killer Angels, a book on the Battle of Gettysburg [69] [72]\n\n\nMarvel Comics\n\n\nSerenity\nAfter Universal Pictures acquired the film and distribution rights from Fox, Whedon began writing the screenplay for Serenity [111] [112] Transforming the series into a film, he says, \".. was the hardest piece of writing I've ever done .. It had to be self-contained and work as a movie, which meant I had to cope with problems like introducing nine main characters who'd already met!\" [113] [114] The script was based on unused story ideas for Firefly's unfilmed second season [85] On writing the dialogue, Whedon felt that part of it came from \"getting to invent the language\", which \"once I had.. reads like a kind of poetry\" [115] The narrative centered on Captain Malcolm Reynolds as the hero accompanied by River Tam acting as the catalyst for what he does [116]\n\n\nFreelance directing and Sugarshock!\nAs a guest director, he contributed two 2007 episodes of The Office (\"Business School\" and \"Branch Wars\") [132] [133] and a 2010 episode of Glee (\"Dream On\") [134] Denoting this period, Whedon has said, \"I had free time, but I'm pretty sure I mean my career was on the skids\" [135]\n\n\nDr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog\nAs a response to the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike, [138] Whedon directed, co-wrote and produced Dr Horrible's Sing-Along Blog [139] It tells the story of Dr Horrible, an aspiring supervillain, who shares a love interest in a girl named Penny with his nemesis, Captain Hammer [140] To Whedon the miniseries was \"a project of love\", an accomplishment that from their excitement would be embellished with passion and \"ridiculousness\" [141] His half-brothers Zack and Jed and sister-in-law Maurissa Tancharoen share the other writing credits [142] Whedon said it was a \"glorious surprise\" to him to discover how well they worked together [143]\n\n\nDollhouse\nIn 2009, Whedon created his fourth television series Dollhouse, and explored themes throughout the show that were initially present in an unproduced spec script of his called Afterlife [149] The series follows Echo, whose brain is programmed to accomplish various assignments, on her journey towards self-awareness [150] [151] As stated by Whedon, Dollhouse was about \"the sides of us that we don't want people to see\", sexuality [152] and, on some level, a celebration of perversion, [153] which he equates to obsession, \"the thing that makes people passionate and interesting and worthy\" [154]\n\n\n2010s\nWhedon co-wrote and produced a horror-comedy film titled The Cabin in the Woods with director Drew Goddard,  finishing production in 2009 though the film was not released until 2011 [157] Whedon and Goddard intended to make a film that exemplified horror movies while still preserving the fun and frightening elements necessary to being a horror film [158] The script was written in three days [159] and they produced a minimum of 15 pages a day [160] Whedon described it as an attempt to revitalize horror, calling it a \"loving hate letter\" to the genre, continuing:\n\n\nThe Cabin in the Woods\nWhedon co-wrote and produced a horror-comedy film titled The Cabin in the Woods with director Drew Goddard,  finishing production in 2009 though the film was

continuing:\n\n\nMarvel Studios\nIn July 2010, it was confirmed that Whedon would write and direct The Avengers, a live-action adaptation of the superhero team of the same name [164] Of his desire to take on the film, he explained that the core of the movie was about \"finding yourself from community\" and the togetherness derived from a group that ultimately doesn't belong together [165]\n\n\nMuch Ado About Nothing\nTo create Much Ado About Nothing in 2012, Whedon established Bellwether Pictures [195] He filmed it in black-and-white on digital video over a period of 12 days at his residence in Santa Monica, California [196] [197] The film was scripted, produced, directed, edited and composed by Whedon, based on William Shakespeare's play of the same name [198] His idea to adapt the play for the screen originated from having \"Shakespeare readings\" at his house with several of his friends, years prior [199] Despite the play's comedy, he discovered that there were elements in the text \"of debauchery\" that brought out a core darkness, and said the visual nature of film influenced him to permeate a motif of sexuality into the script [200]\n\n\nIn Your Eyes and Twist\nWhedon wrote and executive produced the paranormal romance film In Your Eyes, the second feature by Bellwether Pictures [201] [202] The film tells the story of Rebecca Porter and Dylan Kershaw who can feel each other's emotions, but are ultimately strangers [203] Whedon's script marked a theme of human connection as the metaphor for the couple's mysterious link [204] He conceived the idea in the early 1990s, and had written drafts of the screenplay since then [205]\n\n\nJustice League\nIn May 2017, Whedon took over post-production duties for Justice League, including writing and directing additional photography for the film [210] He received a co-writing credit for his contributions to the film, which was released in November 2017 Despite reshooting a majority of the film and largely changing the tone from what Zack Snyder had originally intended, Snyder retained sole credit as director of the film [211] After Snyder's original cut was released in 2021, fans began to refer to the theatrical cut as the \"Whedon Cut\" [212] and \"Josstice League\" [213] [214]\n\n\n2020s\nOn July 13, 2018, HBO announced that the network had obtained the rights to The Nevers, an \"epic science fiction drama about a gang of Victorian women who find themselves with unusual abilities, relentless enemies, and a mission that might change the world\", on which Whedon was going to serve as writer, director, executive producer, and showrunner [215] Production on the series started in July 2019 in London where scenes are filmed at Trinity Church Square and the New Wimbledon Theatre area [216] By 2020, production was completed on five episodes before being shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, only resuming in September of that year to complete six of the season's ten-episode order [217] [218] On November 25, 2020, HBO announced that Whedon had exited the project [219]\n\n\nThe Nevers\nOn July 13, 2018, HBO announced that the network had obtained the rights to The Nevers, an

ten-episode order [217] [218] On November 25, 2020, HBO announced that Whedon had exited the project [219]\n\n\nAccusations of workplace harassment\nIn July 2020, Justice League actor Ray Fisher accused Whedon of showing \"gross, abusive, unprofessional, and completely unacceptable\" behavior toward the cast and crew of the film, [220] going so far as to invite Whedon to sue him for slander if he believed the allegations were untrue [221] A virtual panel for the 2020 at-home San Diego Comic-Con focusing on Whedon's work was cancelled following Fisher's statements [222] The following month, it was reported that WarnerMedia had begun an investigation into Whedon's behavior during the production of Justice League [223] Jason Momoa posted in support of Fisher, writing about \"the shitty way  [they] were treated\" on Justice League reshoots and saying that \"serious stuff went down\" [224] In December 2020, WarnerMedia announced that its investigation had concluded and that \"remedial action\" had been taken [225]\n\n\nUnrealized projects\nEarly in his career, Whedon sold two spec scripts that were not produced, Suspension and Afterlife He sold Suspension for $750,000, with an additional $250,000 if production had commenced [251] In September 2014, Empire suggested the script was being made, with Liam Neeson attached to the project [252] In 1994, he sold Afterlife for $1.5 million, with an additional $500,000 if production had commenced In 2000, Andy Tennant was in talks to direct and rewrite [253] In Afterlife there were precursors to themes Whedon would later explore in Dollhouse The script was about Daniel Hoffstetter, a government scientist, who awakes after dying to discover his mind has been imprinted on a mind-wiped body [254]\n\n\nThemes, style and influences\nEverybody has a perspective Everybody in your scene, including the thug flanking your bad guy, has a reason They have their own voice, their own identity, their own history If anyone speaks in such a way that they're just setting up the next person's lines, then you don't get dialogue: you get soundbites.\n\n\nFeminism\nEquality is not a concept It's not something we should be striving for It's a necessity Equality is like gravity, we need it to stand on this earth as men and women, and the misogyny that is in every culture is not a true part of the human condition It is life out of balance, and that imbalance is sucking something out of the soul of every man and woman who's confronted with it We need equality Kinda now.\n\n\nFrequent collaborators\nWhedon has repeatedly hired the same actors for his projects [330] and has been described as \"the gravitational center of the Whedonverse, a galaxy that spins recurring actors and themes through an orbital system of TV shows, films and comic books that all share similar traits: a unique brand of witty dialogue, relatable characters and fantasy/sci-fi mythology\" [331]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 2013, Whedon said that he is a workaholic This arose during the time that followed the completion of Much Ado About Nothing, which was made in the span of a two-week vacation from The Avengers, [342] and after making the pilot for Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D amidst the pre-production for Avengers: Age of Ultron \"It is actually a problem Sometimes it's adorable .. and sometimes it's not .. Not to get all dark and weird, but it is something I need to address.\" [343] He has been a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in its Writers' branch since 2017 [344]\n\n\nMarriages\nIn 1995, Whedon married Kai Cole, an architect, producer and co-founder of Bellwether Pictures [345] They have two children together [346] [347] Whedon and Cole separated in 2012 and divorced in 2016 [348] In 2017, Cole claimed that Whedon had repeatedly been unfaithful to her and that he \"does not practice what he preaches\" in regard to feminism [328]\n\n\nReligious and philosophical views\nWhedon has identified himself as an atheist [78] [350] [351]\nWhedon has identified as an absurdist and existentialist [350] A committed humanist, Whedon was presented with the Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism by the Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard University in 2009 [352] He has spoken about existentialism, explaining in detail how it, and more specifically Jean-Paul Sartre's Nausea, was used as a basis for the Firefly episode \"Objects in Space\" He called it \"the most important book\" he ever read, [274] and said it was given to him right after he saw Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind, whose impact, he recalls, had made him an existentialist [353]\n\n\nPolitical views\nIn July 2012, at San Diego Comic-Con, in response to one woman who noted the anti-corporate themes in many of his films and asked him to give his economic philosophy in 30 seconds or less, Whedon spoke out against capitalism, saying that America is \"turning into Tsarist Russia\" [354]\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nDark Horse Comics\n\n\nMarvel Comics\n\n\nOther publishers\n\n\nSelected accolades\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Joss Whedon is a renowned American screenwriter, director, and producer, best known for his work in the science fiction and fantasy genres.

become a third-generation TV writer [7] as a son of Tom Whedon, a screenwriter for Alice in the 1970s and The Golden Girls in the 1980s, and a grandson of John Whedon, who worked on The Donna Reed Show in the 1950s and The Dick Van Dyke Show in the 1960s, as well as writing for radio shows such as The Great Gildersleeve [8] His mother, Ann Lee (née Jeffries) Stearns, originally from Kentucky, was an activist and a teacher at Riverdale Country School as Lee Whedon, [9] [10] in addition to being an aspiring novelist [8] Jessica Neuwirth, a former student of Stearns, has often cited her as her inspiration, describing her as a \"visionary feminist\" [11] His parents both acted,  appearing in a play together at the Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club [10] The family would spend vacations reciting Shakespeare [11]\n\n\nCareer\nFrom 1989 to 1990, Whedon worked as a staff writer on the sitcoms Roseanne and Parenthood [19] [20] As a script doctor, Whedon was an uncredited writer on films including The Getaway, Speed, Waterworld, and Twister [21] Whedon worked on an early draft of X-Men which subsequently contained at least two of his contributions to dialogue exchanges, [22] while the final cut of Speed retained most of his dialogue [23] While he was script consulting, he also wrote Buffy the Vampire Slayer (the film that would precede the series), Alien Resurrection and early drafts for Titan A.E and Atlantis: The Lost Empire [24] – but would subsequently express strong dissatisfaction with the released versions of the first three of these films [21] [25] [26] He co-wrote Toy Story, which earned him a shared Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay [27] [25] [28] He became one of the highest paid screenwriters when he sold his Afterlife script to Columbia Pictures for $1.5 million [29]\n\n\n1980s–1990s\nFrom 1989 to 1990, Whedon worked as a staff writer on the sitcoms Roseanne and Parenthood [19] [20] As a script doctor, Whedon was an uncredited writer

sold his Afterlife script to Columbia Pictures for $1.5 million [29]\n\n\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer\nIn 1997, Whedon created his first television series, Buffy the Vampire Slayer.2 The series depicts Buffy Summers, the latest in a line of young women called to battle against vampires, demons, and other forces of darkness The idea came directly from his aversion to seeing the Hollywood formula of \"the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror movie\" [30] Whedon said he wanted to subvert the idea and create someone who was a hero [31] This conception came from \"the very first mission statement of the show, which was the joy of female power: having it, using it, sharing it\" [32] The writing process came together from conversations about the emotional issues facing Buffy Summers, and how she would confront them in her battle against supernatural forces [33] Whedon usually directed episodes from his own scripts that held the most cathartic moments in Buffy's story [34] [35] [36]\n\n\nAngel\nAs a result of the success of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Whedon was given the opportunity to make Angel, his 1999 spin-off series of the show David Greenwalt and Whedon collaborated on the pilot which was going to be developed for The WB Network [54] During the series' early expansion, efforts were made by the network to mitigate Whedon's original concept \"Corrupt\", a precociously optioned second episode, was entirely abandoned due to the gloominess written into the script [55] The tone was then softened in the opening episodes, establishing Angel Investigations as an idealistic, shoestring operation It follows Angel, who works as a private detective in order to \"help the helpless\" [56]\n\n\n2000s\nWhedon followed Angel with the space western Firefly, starring Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Morena Baccarin, Adam Baldwin, Jewel Staite, Sean Maher, Summer Glau and Ron Glass [69] Set in the year 2517, [70] Firefly explores the lives of the people who while on the outskirts of society, make their living as the crew of Serenity, a \"Firefly-class\" spaceship [71] The series' original concept progressed after Whedon read The Killer Angels, a book on the Battle of Gettysburg [69] [72]\n\n\nFirefly\nWhedon followed Angel with the space western Firefly, starring Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Morena Baccarin, Adam

Comics\n\n\nSerenity\nAfter Universal Pictures acquired the film and distribution rights from Fox, Whedon began writing the screenplay for Serenity [111] [112] Transforming the series into a film, he says, \".. was the hardest piece of writing I've ever done .. It had to be self-contained and work as a movie, which meant I had to cope with problems like introducing nine main characters who'd already met!\" [113] [114] The script was based on unused story ideas for Firefly's unfilmed second season [85] On writing the dialogue, Whedon felt that part of it came from \"getting to invent the language\", which \"once I had.. reads like a kind of poetry\" [115] The narrative centered on Captain Malcolm Reynolds as the hero accompanied by River Tam acting as the catalyst for what he does [116]\n\n\nFreelance directing and Sugarshock!\nAs a guest director, he contributed two 2007 episodes of The Office (\"Business School\" and \"Branch Wars\") [132] [133] and a 2010 episode of Glee (\"Dream On\") [134] Denoting this period, Whedon has said, \"I had free time, but I'm pretty sure I mean my career was on the skids\" [135]\n\n\nDr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog\nAs a response to the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike, [138] Whedon directed, co-wrote and produced Dr Horrible's Sing-Along Blog [139] It tells the story of Dr Horrible, an aspiring supervillain, who shares a love interest in a girl named Penny with his nemesis, Captain Hammer [140] To Whedon the miniseries was \"a project of love\", an accomplishment that from their excitement would be embellished with passion and \"ridiculousness\" [141] His half-brothers Zack and Jed and sister-in-law Maurissa Tancharoen share the other writing credits [142] Whedon said it was a \"glorious surprise\" to him to discover how well they worked together [143]\n\n\nDollhouse\nIn 2009, Whedon created his fourth television series Dollhouse, and explored themes throughout the show that were initially present in an unproduced spec script of his called Afterlife [149] The series follows Echo, whose brain is programmed to accomplish various assignments, on her journey towards self-awareness [150] [151] As stated by Whedon, Dollhouse was about \"the sides of us that we don't want people to see\", sexuality [152] and, on some level, a celebration of perversion, [153] which he equates to obsession, \"the thing that makes people passionate and interesting and worthy\" [154]\n\n\n2010s\nWhedon co-wrote and produced a horror-comedy film titled The Cabin in the Woods with director Drew Goddard,  finishing production in 2009 though the film was not released until 2011 [157] Whedon and Goddard intended to make a film that exemplified horror movies while still preserving the fun and frightening elements necessary to being a horror film [158] The script was written in three days [159] and they produced a minimum of 15 pages a day [160] Whedon described it as an attempt to revitalize horror, calling it a \"loving hate letter\" to the genre, continuing:\n\n\nThe Cabin in the Woods\nWhedon co-wrote and produced a horror-comedy film titled The Cabin in the Woods with director Drew Goddard,  finishing production in 2009 though the film was

continuing:\n\n\nMarvel Studios\nIn July 2010, it was confirmed that Whedon would write and direct The Avengers, a live-action adaptation of the superhero team of the same name [164] Of his desire to take on the film, he explained that the core of the movie was about \"finding yourself from community\" and the togetherness derived from a group that ultimately doesn't belong together [165]\n\n\nMuch Ado About Nothing\nTo create Much Ado About Nothing in 2012, Whedon established Bellwether Pictures [195] He filmed it in black-and-white on digital video over a period of 12 days at his residence in Santa Monica, California [196] [197] The film was scripted, produced, directed, edited and composed by Whedon, based on William Shakespeare's play of the same name [198] His idea to adapt the play for the screen originated from having \"Shakespeare readings\" at his house with several of his friends, years prior [199] Despite the play's comedy, he discovered that there were elements in the text \"of debauchery\" that brought out a core darkness, and said the visual nature of film influenced him to permeate a motif of sexuality into the script [200]\n\n\nIn Your Eyes and Twist\nWhedon wrote and executive produced the paranormal romance film In Your Eyes, the second feature by Bellwether Pictures [201] [202] The film tells the story of Rebecca Porter and Dylan Kershaw who can feel each other's emotions, but are ultimately strangers [203] Whedon's script marked a theme of human connection as the metaphor for the couple's mysterious link [204] He conceived the idea in the early 1990s, and had written drafts of the screenplay since then [205]\n\n\nJustice League\nIn May 2017, Whedon took over post-production duties for Justice League, including writing and directing additional photography for the film [210] He received a co-writing credit for his contributions to the film, which was released in November 2017 Despite reshooting a majority of the film and largely changing the tone from what Zack Snyder had originally intended, Snyder retained sole credit as director of the film [211] After Snyder's original cut was released in 2021, fans began to refer to the theatrical cut as the \"Whedon Cut\" [212] and \"Josstice League\" [213] [214]\n\n\n2020s\nOn July 13, 2018, HBO announced that the network had obtained the rights to The Nevers, an \"epic science fiction drama about a gang of Victorian women who find themselves with unusual abilities, relentless enemies, and a mission that might change the world\", on which Whedon was going to serve as writer, director, executive producer, and showrunner [215] Production on the series started in July 2019 in London where scenes are filmed at Trinity Church Square and the New Wimbledon Theatre area [216] By 2020, production was completed on five episodes before being shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, only resuming in September of that year to complete six of the season's ten-episode order [217] [218] On November 25, 2020, HBO announced that Whedon had exited the project [219]\n\n\nThe Nevers\nOn July 13, 2018, HBO announced that the network had obtained the rights to The Nevers, an

ten-episode order [217] [218] On November 25, 2020, HBO announced that Whedon had exited the project [219]\n\n\nAccusations of workplace harassment\nIn July 2020, Justice League actor Ray Fisher accused Whedon of showing \"gross, abusive, unprofessional, and completely unacceptable\" behavior toward the cast and crew of the film, [220] going so far as to invite Whedon to sue him for slander if he believed the allegations were untrue [221] A virtual panel for the 2020 at-home San Diego Comic-Con focusing on Whedon's work was cancelled following Fisher's statements [222] The following month, it was reported that WarnerMedia had begun an investigation into Whedon's behavior during the production of Justice League [223] Jason Momoa posted in support of Fisher, writing about \"the shitty way  [they] were treated\" on Justice League reshoots and saying that \"serious stuff went down\" [224] In December 2020, WarnerMedia announced that its investigation had concluded and that \"remedial action\" had been taken [225]\n\n\nUnrealized projects\nEarly in his career, Whedon sold two spec scripts that were not produced, Suspension and Afterlife He sold Suspension for $750,000,

for $1.5 million, with an additional $500,000 if production had commenced In 2000, Andy Tennant was in talks to direct and rewrite [253] In Afterlife there were precursors to themes Whedon would later explore in Dollhouse The script was about Daniel Hoffstetter, a government scientist, who awakes after dying to discover his mind has been imprinted on a mind-wiped body [254]\n\n\nThemes, style and influences\nEverybody has a perspective Everybody in your scene, including the thug flanking your bad guy, has a reason They have their own voice, their own identity, their own history If anyone speaks in such a way that they're just setting up the next person's lines, then you don't get dialogue: you get soundbites.\n\n\nFeminism\nEquality is not a concept It's not something we should be striving for It's a necessity Equality is like gravity, we need it to stand on this earth as men and women, and the misogyny that is in every culture is not a true part of the human condition It is life out of balance, and that imbalance is sucking something out of the soul of every man and woman who's confronted with it We need equality Kinda now.\n\n\nFrequent collaborators\nWhedon has repeatedly hired the same actors for his projects [330] and has been described as \"the gravitational center of the Whedonverse, a galaxy that spins recurring actors and themes through an orbital system of TV shows, films and comic books that all share similar traits: a unique brand of witty dialogue, relatable characters and fantasy/sci-fi mythology\" [331]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 2013, Whedon said that he is a workaholic This arose during the time that followed the completion of Much Ado About Nothing, which was made in the span of a two-week vacation from The Avengers, [342] and after making the pilot for Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D amidst the pre-production for Avengers: Age of Ultron \"It is actually a problem Sometimes it's adorable .. and sometimes it's not ..

part of the series [21] Auditions for the lead roles took place in New York and Los Angeles [60] The casting director shortlisted 1,000 actors who had applied for each role down to 75 Those who received a callback read in front of Crane, Kauffman and Bright At the end of March, the number of potential actors had been reduced to three or four for each part, and these actors were asked to read for Les Moonves, then president of Warner Bros Television [61]\n\n\nWriting\nIn the weeks after NBC's pick up of Friends, Crane, Kauffman and Bright reviewed sent-in scripts that writers had originally prepared for other series, mainly unproduced Seinfeld episodes [66] Kauffman and Crane hired a team of seven young writers because \"When you're 40, you can't do it anymore The networks and studios are looking for young people coming in out of college.\" [67] The creators felt that using six equal characters, rather than emphasizing one or two, would allow for \"myriad storylines and give the show legs.\" [32] The majority of the storyline ideas came from the writers, although the actors added ideas [60] Although the writers originally planned the big love story to be between Joey and Monica, the idea of a romantic interest between Ross and Rachel emerged during the period when Kauffman and Crane wrote the pilot script [51]\n\n\nFilming\nThe first season was shot on Stage 5 at Warner Bros Studios in Burbank, California [71] NBC executives had worried that the coffee house setting was too hip and asked for the series to be set in a diner, but eventually consented to the coffee house concept [51] The opening title sequence was filmed in a fountain at the Warner Bros Ranch at 4:00 am, while it was particularly cold for a Burbank morning [72] At the beginning of the second season, production moved to the larger Stage 24, which was renamed The \"Friends\" Stage after the series finale [73]\n\n\nSeries finale\nThe series's creators completed the first draft of the hour-long finale in January 2004, four months before its original airing Crane, Kauffman and Bright watched the finales of other sitcoms to prepare the episode's outline, paying attention to what worked and what did not They liked the ones that stayed true to the series, deeming the finale of The Mary Tyler Moore Show to be the gold standard Crane, Kauffman, and Bright had difficulty writing the finale They did not want to do \"something high concept, or take the show out of the show.\" [76] The most critical parts of the finale were shot without an audience and with a minimum number of crew members The main cast enjoyed the finale and were confident that the fans would react similarly: [76]\n\n\nReunion special\nOn November 12, 2019, The Hollywood Reporter announced that Warner Bros

\"The One Where They Got Back Together\", was set to be released in May the same year, along with the 236 original episodes of the series [83] [84] On March 18, 2020, it was announced that the special, which was set to film on the Friends stage on March 23 and 24, had been postponed indefinitely, due to the COVID-19 pandemic [85] In November 2020, Matthew Perry tweeted that the reunion is set to start filming in March 2021 [86] [87] On May 13, 2021, a teaser trailer was released officially announcing Friends: The Reunion also known as \"The One Where They Get Back Together\" The reunion special was released on HBO Max on May 27, 2021 [88]\n\n\nReception\nEarly reviews of the series were mixed; [89] [90] [91] the first season holds a Metacritic score of 65 out of 100, based on 24 sampled reviews, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\" [92] Tom Feran of The Plain Dealer wrote that the series traded \"vaguely and less successfully on the hanging-out style of Seinfeld\", [93] while Ann Hodges of the Houston Chronicle called it \"the new Seinfeld wannabe, but it will never be as funny as Seinfeld.\" [94] In the Los Angeles Daily News, Ray Richmond named the series as \"one of the brighter comedies of the new season\", [95] and the Los Angeles Times called it \"flat-out the best comedy series of the new season.\" [96]\n\n\nCritical reception\nEarly reviews of the

of Friends during the series' run Aniston's hairstyle was nicknamed \"The Rachel\" and copied around the world [21] Joey's catchphrase, \"How you doin'?\", became a popular part of Western English slang, often used as a pick-up line or when greeting friends [136] The series also influenced the English language, according to a study by the University of Toronto that found that the characters used the emphasized word \"so\" to modify adjectives more often than any other intensifier Although the preference had already made its way into the American vernacular, usage on the series may have accelerated the change [33] Chandler's habit of ending a sentence unfinished for sarcasm also influenced viewers' speech [137] The show's availability on streaming television—it accounted for 4% of all Netflix views in 2018—gave it a large new Gen Z audience Kauffman reported that her high school daughter's friends thought that Friends was a new period piece about the 1990s One young fan described the show as \"aspirational ..  [kids hope] that when they're that age .. they'll have those friends\" [138]\n\n\nCoffee house\nThe Central Perk coffee house, one of the principal settings of the series, is part of the Warner Bros Studio Tour Hollywood People sometimes propose marriage on the couch, and many tourists cry when they sit on it [133] The coffee house has inspired various imitations worldwide In 2006, Iranian

signage and bricks The coffee houses contain paintings of the various characters from the series, and televisions playing Friends episodes James Michael Tyler, who plays Gunther, the Central Perk

their client to be a part of the series [21] Auditions for the lead roles took place in New York and Los Angeles [60] The casting director shortlisted 1,000 actors who had applied for each role down to 75 Those who received a callback read in front of Crane, Kauffman and Bright At the end of March, the number of potential actors had been reduced to three or four for each part, and these actors were asked to read for Les Moonves, then president of Warner Bros Television [61]\n\n\nWriting\nIn the weeks after NBC's pick up of Friends, Crane, Kauffman and Bright reviewed sent-in scripts that writers had originally prepared for other series, mainly unproduced Seinfeld episodes [66] Kauffman and Crane hired a team of seven young writers because \"When you're 40, you can't do it anymore The networks and studios are looking for young people coming in out of college.\" [67] The creators felt that using six equal characters, rather than emphasizing one or two, would allow for \"myriad storylines and give the show legs.\" [32] The majority of the storyline ideas came from the writers, although the actors added ideas [60] Although the writers originally planned the big love story to be between Joey and Monica, the idea of a romantic interest between Ross and Rachel emerged during the period when Kauffman and Crane wrote the pilot script [51]\n\n\nFilming\nThe first season was shot on Stage 5 at Warner Bros Studios in Burbank, California [71] NBC executives had worried that the coffee house setting was too hip and asked for the series to be set in a diner, but eventually consented to the coffee house concept [51] The opening title sequence was filmed in a fountain at the Warner Bros Ranch at 4:00 am, while it was particularly cold for a Burbank morning [72] At the beginning of the second season, production moved to the larger Stage 24, which was renamed The \"Friends\" Stage after the series finale [73]\n\n\nSeries finale\nThe series's creators completed the first draft of the hour-long finale in January 2004, four months before its original airing Crane, Kauffman and Bright watched the finales of other sitcoms to prepare the episode's outline, paying attention to what worked and what did not They liked the ones that stayed true to the series, deeming the finale of The Mary Tyler Moore Show to be the gold standard Crane, Kauffman, and Bright had difficulty writing the finale They did not want to do \"something high concept, or take the show out of the show.\" [76] The most critical parts of the finale were shot without an audience and with a minimum number of crew members The main cast enjoyed the finale and were confident that the fans would react similarly: [76]\n\n\nReunion special\nOn November 12, 2019, The Hollywood Reporter announced that Warner Bros TV was developing a Friends reunion for HBO Max that would feature the whole cast and creators returning [82] On February 21, 2020, HBO confirmed that the unscripted reunion special, tentatively named \"The One Where They Got Back Together\", was set to be released in May the same year, along with the 236 original episodes of the series [83] [84] On March 18, 2020, it was announced that the special, which was set to film on the Friends stage on March 23 and 24, had been postponed indefinitely, due to the COVID-19 pandemic [85] In November 2020, Matthew Perry tweeted that the reunion is set to start filming in March 2021 [86] [87] On May 13, 2021, a teaser trailer was released officially announcing Friends: The Reunion also known as \"The One Where They Get Back Together\" The reunion special was released on HBO Max on May 27, 2021 [88]\n\n\nReception\nEarly reviews of the series were mixed; [89] [90] [91] the first season holds a Metacritic score of 65 out of 100, based on 24 sampled reviews, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\" [92] Tom Feran of The Plain Dealer wrote that the series traded \"vaguely and less successfully on the hanging-out style of Seinfeld\", [93] while Ann Hodges of the Houston Chronicle called it \"the new Seinfeld wannabe, but it will never be as funny as Seinfeld.\" [94] In the Los Angeles Daily News, Ray Richmond named the series as \"one of the brighter comedies of the new season\", [95] and the Los Angeles Times called it \"flat-out the best comedy series of the new season.\" [96]\n\n\nCritical

Los Angeles Times called it \"flat-out the best comedy series of the new season.\" [96]\n\n\nAwards\nTo maintain the series's ensemble format, the main cast members decided to enter themselves in the same acting categories for awards [34] Beginning with the  eighth season, the actors decided to submit themselves in the lead actor balloting, rather than in the supporting actor fields [110] The series was nominated for 62 Primetime Emmy Awards, [111] winning six.\n\n\nRatings\nThe table below shows the ratings of Friends in the United States, where it consistently ranked within the top ten of the final television season ratings [122] \"Rank\" refers to how well Friends rated compared to other television series that aired during primetime hours of the corresponding television season It is shown in relation to the total number of series airing on the then-six major English-language networks in a given season \"Viewers\" refers to the average number of viewers for all original episodes, broadcast during the television season in the series' regular timeslot The \"season premiere\" is the date that the first episode of the season aired, and the \"season finale\" is the date that the final episode of the season aired Following the September 11 attacks, ratings increased 17% over the previous season [102]\n\n\nSyndication\nBecause of syndication revenue, Friends continues to generate approximately $1 billion each year for Warner Bros That translates into about $20 million in annual residuals each for Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, who each get 2% of syndication income for Friends [132]\n\n\nLegacy and cultural impact\nAlthough the producers thought of Friends as \"only a TV show\", psychologists investigated the cultural impact of Friends during the series' run Aniston's hairstyle was nicknamed \"The Rachel\" and copied around the world [21] Joey's catchphrase, \"How you doin'?\", became a popular part of Western English slang, often used as a pick-up line or when greeting friends [136] The series also influenced the English language, according to a study by the University of Toronto that found that the characters used the emphasized word \"so\" to modify adjectives more often than any other intensifier Although the preference had already made its way into the American vernacular, usage on the series may have accelerated the change [33] Chandler's habit of ending a sentence unfinished for sarcasm also influenced viewers' speech [137] The show's availability on streaming television—it accounted for 4% of all Netflix views in 2018—gave it a large new Gen Z audience Kauffman reported that her high school daughter's friends thought that Friends was a new period piece about the 1990s One young fan described the show as \"aspirational ..  [kids hope] that when they're that age .. they'll have those friends\" [138]\n\n\nCoffee house\nThe Central Perk coffee house, one of the principal settings of the series, is part of the Warner Bros Studio Tour Hollywood People sometimes propose marriage on the couch, and many tourists cry when they sit on it [133] The coffee house has inspired various imitations worldwide In 2006, Iranian businessman Mojtaba Asadian started a Central Perk franchise, registering the name in 32 countries The decor of the coffee houses is inspired by Friends, featuring replica couches, counters, neon signage and bricks The coffee houses contain paintings of the various characters from the series, and televisions playing Friends episodes James Michael Tyler, who plays Gunther, the Central Perk manager in the series, attended the grand opening of the Dubai café, where he worked as a waiter [156]\n\n\nDistribution\nAfter the produced pilot lived up to NBC's hopes, the series premiered with the name Friends on September 22, 1994, in the coveted Thursday 8:30 p.m time slot The pilot aired between Mad About You and Seinfeld, [21] and was watched by almost 22 million American viewers [3] The series was a huge success throughout its run and was a staple of NBC's Thursday night line-up, dubbed by the network as Must See TV [166] When Crane told reporters in 2001 that the ninth season was a possibility, critics believed that he was posturing and that at least two of the cast members would not sign on for another season [102] When it was confirmed that Friends would return for a

stations, starting with the pilot episode For the remastered episodes, Warner Bros restored previously cropped images on the left and right sides of the screen, using the original 35 mm film source, to use the entire 16:9 widescreen frame Because the show was not originally filmed for widescreen, but rather filmed in 4-perf format and protected for 4:3, some cropping problems arise in some shots where information from the top and bottom of the frame is removed, and some expanded shots reveal unintentional artifacts, including set edges, boom mics and body doubles replacing some of the main cast [193]\n\n\nHome media\nIn October 2014, Warner Bros chairman and chief executive officer, Kevin Tsujihara, announced that the company had licensed the North American streaming rights of all ten

{"title": "2020–2021_Indian_farmers'_protest", "content": "\nBackground\nIndia is self-sufficient in the production of food such as food grains [a] including wheat and rice; and other categories such as fruits, vegetables, milk and meat among others Yet, despite this, nutrition and hunger remain a serious challenge in the country [76] [77] In 2021, India ranked 101 out of 116 countries in the Global Hunger Index [78] According to the United Nations, India bears 1/4th of the entire world's hunger burden [79] This is despite India having overarching food ration and welfare schemes [citation needed]\n\n\nSecond green revolution\nFormer Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, during an interview in 2004, said, [92]\n\n\nThree agriculture laws\nIn 2017, the central government released the Model Farming Acts However, after a certain period of time, it was found that a number of the reforms suggested in the acts had not been implemented by the states A committee consisting of seven Chief Ministers was set up in July 2019 to discuss the implementation Accordingly, the central Government of India promulgated three ordinances (or temporary laws) in the first week of June 2020, which dealt with agricultural produce, their sale, hoarding, agricultural marketing and contract farming reforms among other things [98] [99] These ordinances were introduced as bills and passed by the Lok Sabha on 15 and 18 September 2020 [100] Later, on 20 and 22 September, the three bills were passed by the Rajya Sabha, where the government is in a minority, via a voice vote – ignoring the requests of the opposition for a full vote [101] [102] The President of India gave his assent by signing the bills on 28 September, thus converting them into acts [103] The legality of the acts has been questioned; \"agriculture\" is mentioned in the state list six times, the union list four times, and the concurrent list two times [104] [105]\n\n\nInternational precedents\nMany developing economies reformed their agriculture policies in the 1980s and 1990s to encourage private sector participation [106] Swati Dhingra of the London School of Economics cites the case of Kenya in which their agriculture reforms increased the ease of doing business, however this very increase caused other problems for the farmers [106] In February 2021, 87 farmers' unions in the United States wrote a solidarity letter, giving the example of Reagan era farm policies – \"Reagan era furthered the farm crisis through deliberate federal policy changes, with systematic erosion of parity prices and other deregulatory efforts.\" [107]\n\n\nFarmer unions' demands\nThe farmer unions believe that the laws will open the sale and marketing of agricultural products outside the notified Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) mandis for farmers Further, the laws will allow inter-state trade and encourage hike electronic trading of agricultural produce The new laws prevent the state governments from collecting a market fee, cess, or levy for trade outside the APMC markets; this has led the farmers to believe the laws will \"gradually lead to the deterioration and ultimately end the mandi system\" thus \"leaving farmers at the mercy of corporates\" Further, the farmers believe that the laws will end their existing relationship with agricultural small-scale businessmen (commission agents who act as middlemen by providing financial loans, ensuring timely procurement, and promising adequate prices for their crop) [109]\n\n\nImmediate demand\nThe farmer unions believe that the laws will open the sale and marketing of agricultural products outside the notified Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) mandis for farmers Further, the laws will allow inter-state trade and encourage hike electronic trading of agricultural produce The new laws prevent the state governments from collecting a market fee, cess, or levy for trade outside the APMC markets; this has led the farmers to believe the laws will \"gradually lead to the deterioration and ultimately end the mandi system\" thus \"leaving farmers at the mercy of corporates\" Further, the farmers believe that the laws will end their existing relationship with agricultural small-scale businessmen (commission agents who act as middlemen by providing financial loans, ensuring timely procurement, and promising adequate prices for their crop) [109]\n\n\nLater demands\nAdditionally, protesting farmers believe dismantling the APMC mandis will encourage abolishing the purchase of their crops at the Minimum Support Price (MSP) They are therefore demanding the minimum support prices to be guaranteed by the government in writing [109] Other demands added over time have included-\n\n\nMinimum support price (MSP)\nFollowing the Prime Minister's announcement of the repeal of the farm laws in November 2021, there were renewed demands for a guaranteed MSP This had been the second major demand throughout the farmers' protest [122] [123] This came amid reminders of the government's target of doubling farmers' incomes by 2022;

the Indian government in September 2020. The protests were a culmination of the long-standing demands of farmers for better prices for their produce, fair market practices, and an end to the exploitation of farmers by corporate entities.\n\n**Background**\n\nIndia is self-sufficient in the production of food such as food grains, fruits, vegetables, milk, and meat, among others. However, despite this, nutrition and hunger remain a serious challenge in the country. In 2021, India ranked 101 out of 116 countries in the Global Hunger Index. According to the United Nations, India bears 1/4th of the entire world's hunger burden. This is despite India having overarching food ration and welfare schemes.\n\n**Second Green Revolution**\n\nFormer Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, during an interview in 2004, said that the Indian government had failed to implement the recommendations of the National Commission on Farmers, which was set up to address the issues of farmers. He stated that the government had not taken adequate steps to improve the prices of crops, reduce input costs, and provide adequate support to farmers.\n\n**Three Agriculture Laws**\n\nIn 2017, the central government released the Model Farming Acts, which proposed reforms in the agriculture sector. However, after a certain period of time, it was found that a number of the reforms suggested in the acts had not been implemented by the states. A committee consisting of seven Chief Ministers was set up in July 2019 to discuss the implementation of the reforms. In June 2020, the central government promulgated three ordinances, which dealt with agricultural produce, their sale, hoarding, agricultural marketing, and contract farming reforms, among other things. These ordinances were introduced as bills and passed by the Lok Sabha on 15 and 18 September 2020. Later, on 20 and 22 September, the three bills were passed by the Rajya Sabha, where the government is in a minority, via a voice vote – ignoring the requests of the opposition for a full vote. The President of India gave his assent by signing the bills on 28 September, thus converting them into acts.\n\n**International Precedents**\n\nMany developing economies reformed their agriculture policies in the 1980s and 1990s to encourage private sector participation. Swati Dhingra of the London School of Economics cites the case of Kenya, which reformed its agriculture policies to increase the ease of doing business, however, this very increase caused other problems for the farmers. In February 2021, 87 farmers' unions in the United States wrote a solidarity letter, giving the example of Reagan-era farm policies, which furthered the farm crisis through deliberate federal policy changes, with systematic erosion of parity prices and other deregulatory efforts.\n\n**Farmer Unions' Demands**\n\nThe farmer unions believe that the laws will open the sale and marketing of agricultural products outside the notified Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) mandis for farmers. The laws will also allow inter-state trade and encourage hike electronic trading of agricultural produce. The new laws prevent the state governments from collecting a market fee, cess, or levy for trade outside the APMC markets, which has led the farmers to believe that the laws will \"gradually lead to the deterioration and ultimately end the mandi system\" thus \"leaving farmers at the mercy of corporates.\" The farmers also believe that the laws will end their existing relationship with agricultural small-scale businessmen (commission agents who act as middlemen by providing financial loans, ensuring timely procurement, and promising adequate prices for their crop).\n\n**Immediate Demand**\n\nThe farmer unions believe that the laws will open the sale and marketing of agricultural products outside the notified APMC mandis for farmers. The laws will also allow inter-state trade and encourage hike electronic trading of agricultural produce. The new laws prevent the state governments from collecting a market fee, cess, or levy for trade outside the APMC markets, which has led the farmers to believe that the laws will \"gradually lead to the deterioration and ultimately end the mandi system\" thus \"leaving farmers at the mercy of corporates.\" The farmers also believe that the laws will end their existing relationship with agricultural small-scale businessmen (commission agents who act as middlemen by providing financial loans, ensuring timely procurement, and promising adequate prices for their crop).\n\n**Later Demands**\n\nAdditionally, protesting farmers believe that dismantling the APMC mandis will encourage abolishing the purchase of their crops at the Minimum Support Price (MSP). They are therefore demanding the minimum support prices to be guaranteed by the government in writing. Other demands added over time have included the scrapping of the three farm laws, the implementation of the Swaminathan Committee recommendations, and the provision of a legal guarantee for MSP.\n\n**List of Protesting Farm Unions**\n\nUnder the coordination of bodies such as Samyukt Kisan Morcha and All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, several protesting farm unions are involved in the protests. These include the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), All India Kisan Sabha, Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh, and Samyukta Kisan Morcha, among others.\n\n**Protests and Incidents**\n\nThe protests started in August 2020 when the Farm Bills were made public. The protests gained momentum in September 2020 after the passage of the bills. The protests have been marked by several incidents of violence and clashes between the police and the protesters. The protesters have also blocked several highways and border points, including the Kundli Border, Dhansa Border, Jharoda Kalan Border, Tikri Border, Singhu Border, Kalindi Kunj Border, Chilla Border, Bahadurgarh Border, and Faridabad Border.\n\n**Accommodation and Supplies**\n\nThe farmers in the camps are being supported by domestic and international NGOs, including UK-based Khalsa Aid, with provisions of tents, solar-powered mobile charging points, air conditioners, televisions, laundry, library, medical stalls, dental camp, which did tooth retraction, cleaning, filling, and scaling treatments, foot massage chairs for protesters.\n\n**Healthcare**\n\nDoctor Swaiman Singh was doing a fellowship with Newark Beth Israel Medical Center when he heard of the death of someone close at the farmer protest in December 2020. He planned to provide services at the protest sites on the outskirts of the capital territory for just a few weeks, but ended up spending a number of months. Through his non-government organization, a large team of doctors are available at the protest sites periodically. Volunteers also turned out to help with the needs of the free medical camps such as transporting supplies.\n\n**Fatalities**\n\nAs of 5 March 2021, 248 farmers were confirmed dead. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha has stated that until 10 July 2021, over 537 participants have died in the protest. BKU leader Rakesh Tikait stated that around 750 protestors had died in October and November 2021.\n\n**Supreme Court Involvement**\n\nThe Supreme Court of India has received numerous petitions seeking direction to remove protesting farmers from blocking access routes to the capital. The Supreme Court has also conveyed to the central government that it intends to set up a body for taking forward the negotiations. On 17 December, the Supreme Court acknowledged the right to peaceful protest but added, \"you (farmers) have a purpose also and that purpose is served only if you talk, discuss, and reach a conclusion.\"\n\n**Supreme Court Stay Order and Farm Laws Committee**\n\nOn 12 January 2021, the Supreme Court suspended the farm laws and formed a committee to look into the grievances of protesting farmers. The CJI, Sharad Arvind Bobde, requested the farmer unions to cooperate. The members of the committee included agriculture experts Ashok Gulati, Pramod Kumar Joshi, Anil Ghanwat, and Bhupinder Singh Mann. However, two days later, Bhupinder Singh Mann recused himself in solidarity with the farmers.\n\n**Counter-Legislation by States**\n\nThe Punjab state assembly passed four bills to counter the Centre's three farm laws. Following this, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh also tabled bills to amend and counter the central laws. The respective state governors have either returned the bills or have sat on them refusing to give them assent and send it to the President.\n\n**Fallout**\n\nAs fallout of the growing belief amongst protesting farmers that Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani were the principal beneficiaries of the farm laws enacted by the NDA Government, Punjab and Haryana farmers, in protest, decided to surrender Jio-sims and switch to rival networks. A number of Reliance Jio telecom towers and other infrastructure were damaged in Punjab in the last week of December 2020.\n\n**Repeal**\n\nIn a televised address on 19 November 2021, Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India, said his government would be repealing the three acts in the upcoming winter parliamentary session in December. The national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, Rakesh Tikait, stated that the protests would only cease once the laws were repealed.\n\n**Music and Popular Media**\n\nSince the beginning of protests, many songs have been released by singers and songwriters describing the protest and showing unity and solidarity. Several clips of the protest featured in an international collaboration \"Ek Din\" by Bohemia, The Game, and Karan Aujla. Kanwar Grewal, who has been involved in gathering support for the protests since the beginning, praised the support of those who were living abroad.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2020–2021_Indian_farmers'_protest\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nIndia is self-sufficient in the production of food such as food grains [a] including wheat and rice;

[124] in 2016 the finance minister had stated \"we need to think beyond food security and give back to our farmers a sense of income security\" [125] Relevant recommendations by the MS Swaminathan headed National Commission on Farmers have been cited as a reminder [126] [74]\n\n\nList of protesting farm unions\nUnder the coordination of bodies such as Samyukt Kisan Morcha and All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, [b] the protesting farm unions include: [127] [109] [128]\n\n\nProtests and incidents\nIn Punjab, small-scale protests had started in August 2020 when the Farm Bills were made public It was only after the passage of the acts that more farmers and farm unions across India joined the protests against the reforms [citation needed] On 25 September 2020 farm unions all over India called for a Bharat Bandh (lit. transl. nation-wide shutting down) to protest against these farm laws [130] The most widespread protests took place in Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh [131] but demonstrations were also reported in Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, [132] Tamil Nadu, [133] Odisha, [134] Kerala [135] and other states [136] Railway services remained suspended in Punjab for more than two months due to the protests, starting from October [137] Following this, farmers from different states then marched to Delhi to protest against the laws [138] Farmers also criticized the national media for misrepresenting the protest [139] From 12 December, farmer unions took over highway toll plazas in Haryana and allowed free movement of vehicles [140] In certain parts of India, bullock-cart rallies in support of farmer's protest have also been organized by marginal farmers [141] Transport bodies such as the All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC), representing about 9.5 million truckers and 5 million bus and taxi drivers, have threatened to halt the movement of supplies in the northern states, and if the government fails to address the farmer's issues, it would be done nationwide [129]\n\n\n2020\nThe first farmer to die was Dhanna Singh (age 45) of Mansa district in Punjab He was a leader of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda) He died, on the night of 26 November 2020, according to farmer leaders and media reports, while trying to negotiate his tractor past the Haryana Police road barricade of sand-laden trucks and stones He was on his way to join the farmers who had been stopped by the Delhi Police on 26 November, on the border of Haryana, and Delhi [245] [246]\n\n\nRail Roko and Dilli Chalo\nOn 24 September 2020, farmers started a \"Rail roko\" (transl. \"stop the trains\") campaign, following which train services to and from Punjab were affected [142] Farmers extended the campaign into October [143] On 23 October, some farmer unions decided to call off the campaign, as supplies of fertilizer and other goods in the state were starting to run short [144]\n\n\nBlocking of borders and roads\nA number of borders, including the Kundli Border, Dhansa border, Jharoda Kalan border, Tikri border, Singhu border, Kalindi Kunj border, Chilla border, Bahadurgarh border and Faridabad border, were blocked by protesters during the protests [168] [169] On 29 November, the protesters announced that they would block five further points of entry into Delhi, namely Ghaziabad-Hapur, Rohtak, Sonipat, Jaipur and Mathura [170] This resulted in minor clashes involving stone pelting and lathi charges with the police [171] [172] In early February 2021, metal barricades, cement walls and iron nails were put up at the roads leading to the three main borders (Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur) to block any vehicles from entering Delhi Barbed fences were also put up to prevent people from entering Delhi on foot [173] [174] As of 22 March 2021, a number of Delhi borders remained shut [175] There are around 40,000 protestors sitting at Singhu and Tikri [11] Some highways were also blocked in protest [176]\n\n\nCounter-protests\nThe Shetkari Sanghatana, a farmers' union in Maharashtra, supports the bills and wants the market to decide the prices of agricultural commodities It claims that the minimum support prices have actually weakened farmers, instead of empowering them The Sanghatana demands that the government stops intervening in the agricultural commodity market so that farmers will not have to depend on the minimum support prices [177] [178]\n\n\n2021\nOn 1 January 2021, Galtan Singh, 57, of Baghpat, UP, who was part of the protesters at Ghazipur border, died after complaining of breathlessness He became the first farmer fatality of 2021, and first reported farmer-death on the UP border [250] On 2 January, three farmers died: two at the Tikri Border, and one at the Singhu border In Tikri Jagbir Singh, 66, from Jind district, died of suspected heart-attack;

executive David Levy stumbled across one of Addams' books in a New York bookstore, and realized that the tone would be perfect for television He purchased the book and met with Addams in the Plaza Hotel, and the topic of a television adaptation was raised Addams had been approached about television adaptations by others in the past, but he was inclined to take Levy up on the offer because of their shared friend in the author John O'Hara At the next meeting, at Addams' apartment, Levy indicated the characters would need to be named, and Addams came up with a list for the third meeting According to Levy, Addams had little involvement with the series  after those three meetings He retained the right to veto casting decisions and other choices, but did not make use of the power [9] Some rights to the franchise were given to Filmways, the production company for the show [13]\n\n\nWave of interest in Australia (1979-1989)\nWhile William Shawn's ban on further Addams Family comics

family themed ceremony conducted in a cemetery [10] Filmways, the production company of the 1964 series and holder of some franchise rights, was purchased in 1982 by Orion Pictures The retirement of Shawn in 1987 allowed a brief return of the cartoons to The New Yorker, though Addams died only a year later While largely inactive in the United States, the franchise did however see a wave of popularity in Australia, brought on by widely watched reruns on TCN-9 New merchandise was released in Australia and a \"Morticia Boutique Dress Shop\" opened in Melbourne in 1988 A satellite-linked interview with surviving members of the original cast was also aired on Australian television A fan quoted by Cox credited the tone of the Addams family for its success in 1980s Australia, noting that the characters were \"less American\" than the Munsters, and that Australians had a different life-style Astin reprised his role as Gomez for a 1989 episode of Nick at Nite's Sitcom Zone, in which he introduced reruns of shows for a two-hour programming block A 1989 video game Fester's Quest was developed by Sunsoft, and is now considered among the worst games of all time To promote the game some black-and-white advertisements were filmed using the characters [17] [9]\n\n\nFilm series and The New Addams Family (1991–2001)\nThe head of production at 20th Century Fox, Scott Rudin, pitched an Addams Family film but Fox did not have the rights to the franchise The rights were at the time split between two parties: The late Addams' second wife Barbara Barb, and Orion Pictures The latter were in possession of film rights in particular after purchasing Filmways in 1982 Fox attempted to purchase those rights but failed, as Orion had plans for a new TV series The studio's plans changed however after Barb sold her rights to Orion, and the studio brought Rudin on board to produce a film Caroline Thompson and Larry Wilson wrote a script, and faced many re-writes early on Tim Burton was considered for director, but the role ultimately went to Barry Sonnenfeld.\nThe film featured a new cast, Blossom Rock (Grandmama) having died in 1978, Ted Cassidy (Lurch) in 1979, Carolyn Jones (Morticia) in 1983 and Jackie Coogan (Fester) in 1984.\nProduction on the film was troubled, with Sonnenfeld blacking out on set, and a burst blood vessel in Raul Julia's eye further delaying the shoot Director of photography Owen Roizman quit the production three months from completion, forcing Sonnenfeld to take on the role in addition to his existing responsibilities Orion faced financial issues and sold the project and Addams family rights to Paramount mid-production- though the deal did not include overseas home media rights, which harmed distribution after release Orion retained those, and those rights passed to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer when the studio was bought out in 1997 [13]\n\n\nMusical and animated adaptations (2007-2021)\nIn 2007, Elephant Eye Theatrical announced that they had obtained the rights to a musical adaptation of the comic series, which at that time were held by the Tee and Charles Addams Foundation [20] After a try-out in Chicago in 2009, the musical was

entitled Wednesday in 2019, financed by MGM The writers room for the series took place during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and so was conducted remotely The project was formally announced in 2020, with Burton as executive producer The first series was released in 2022 to critical acclaim [22] Amazon purchased MGM in 2021, which in turn means that the Addams Family rights now rest with the company [23]\n\n\nPremise and background\nThe family appears to be a branch of an extensive Addams clan, with relatives all over the world In the original television series they are said to be related to \"those one-D Adamses\", a fact the family are deeply ashamed of According to the film version, the family credo is, Sic gorgiamus allos subjectatos nunc (pseudo-Latin: \"We gladly feast on those who would subdue us\") Charles Addams was first inspired by his hometown of Westfield, New Jersey, an area full of ornate Victorian mansions and archaic graveyards [24] In the original comics series they live in a 'gothic' house on Cemetery Ridge According to the television series, the residence is a gloomy mansion adjacent to a cemetery and a swamp located in an unspecified American town In the musical (first shown in Chicago in 2009), the house is located in Central Park [25] In the 2019 film, the Addamses live in an abandoned asylum located in the outskirts of the state of New Jersey which is haunted by a disembodied resident who demands the property to remain undisturbed.\n\n\nAdaptations\nIn 1964, the ABC TV network created The Addams Family television series based on Addams's cartoon

Family\n\nThe Addams Family is a fictional family created by American cartoonist Charles Addams. The family first appeared in a series of drawings published in The New Yorker magazine in the 1930s. The characters were later developed into a television series, film series, and other adaptations.\n\nHistory\n\nCharles Addams began as a cartoonist in The New Yorker with a sketch of a window washer that ran on February 6, 1932. Addams first drew the then-unnamed Morticia some years before her first published appearance in The New Yorker. Some sources give a date of 1933, while Addams himself when asked in interview suggested \"around 1937.\" Media speculation at the time often connected Morticia to Charles Addams' first wife Barbara Jean Day, but he had yet to meet her. In an interview in 1981 he acknowledged that Morticia reflected the qualities he was attracted to. Because of this, the women he married later on resembled the character. He described Morticia as \"not patterned after anyone in particular, although I've often thought there was a little Gloria Swanson in her.\"\n\nOrigins and The New Yorker cartoons (1933–1964)\n\nCharles Addams began as a cartoonist in The New Yorker with a sketch of a window washer that ran on February 6, 1932.

He described Morticia as \"not patterned after anyone in particular, although I've often thought there was a little Gloria Swanson in her.\"\n\nTV adaptations and rise to popularity (1964–1977)\n\nIn the early 1960s, NBC executive David Levy stumbled across one of Addams' books in a New York bookstore, and realized that the tone would be perfect for television. He purchased the book and met with Addams in the Plaza Hotel, and the topic of a television adaptation was raised. Addams had been approached about television adaptations by others in the past, but he was inclined to take Levy up on the offer because of their shared friend in the author John O'Hara. At the next meeting, at Addams' apartment, Levy indicated the characters would need to be named, and Addams came up with a list for the third meeting. According to Levy, Addams had little involvement with the series after those three meetings. Some rights to the franchise were given to Filmways, the production company for the show.\n\nWave of interest in Australia (1979-1989)\n\nWhile William Shawn's ban on further Addams Family comics in The New Yorker persisted until 1987; Addams was able to sneak in several of the characters as a cameo in Z Line Subway, a 1979 strip. He married Marilyn Matthews Miller in 1981, in an Addams family themed ceremony conducted in a cemetery. Filmways, the production company of the 1964 series and holder of some franchise rights, was purchased in 1982 by Orion Pictures. The retirement of Shawn in 1987 allowed a brief return of the cartoons to The New Yorker.\n\nFilm series and The New Addams Family (1991–2001)\n\nThe head of production at 20th Century Fox, Scott Rudin, pitched an Addams Family film but Fox did not have the rights to the franchise. The rights were at the time split between two parties: The late Addams' second wife Barbara Barb, and Orion Pictures. The latter were in possession of film rights in particular after purchasing Filmways in 1982. Fox attempted to purchase those rights but failed, as Orion had plans for a new TV series. The studio's plans changed however after Barb sold her rights to Orion, and the studio brought Rudin on board to produce a film. Caroline Thompson and Larry Wilson wrote a script, and faced many re-writes early on. Tim Burton was considered for director, but the role ultimately went to Barry Sonnenfeld.\n\nMusical and animated adaptations (2007-2021)\n\nIn 2007, Elephant Eye Theatrical announced that they had obtained the rights to a musical adaptation of the comic series, which at that time were held by the Tee and Charles Addams Foundation. After a try-out in Chicago in 2009, the musical was performed on Broadway in 2010, and thereafter in a sequence of international tours until 2021.\n\nWednesday (2022-present)\n\nIn 2019, Miles Millar and Alfred Gough began work on a live-action spin off series entitled Wednesday. Financed by MGM, the writers room for the series took place during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and so was conducted remotely. The project was formally announced in 2020, with Burton as executive producer. The first series was released in 2022 to critical acclaim. Amazon purchased MGM in 2021, which in turn means that the Addams Family rights now rest with the company.\n\nPremise and background\n\nThe family appears to be a branch of an extensive Addams clan, with relatives all over the world. In the original television series, they are said to be related to \"those one-D Adamses\", a fact the family are deeply ashamed of. According to the film version, the family credo is, Sic gorgiamus allos subjectatos nunc (pseudo-Latin: \"We gladly feast on those who would subdue us\"). Charles Addams was first inspired by his hometown of Westfield, New Jersey, an area full of ornate Victorian mansions and archaic graveyards. In the original comics series, they live in a 'gothic' house on Cemetery Ridge. According to the television series, the residence is a gloomy mansion adjacent to a cemetery and a swamp located in an unspecified American town. In the musical, the house is located in Central Park. In the 2019 film, the Addamses live in an abandoned asylum located in the outskirts of the state of New Jersey which is haunted by a disembodied resident who demands the property to remain undisturbed.\n\nAdaptations\n\nThe Addams Family's first animated appearance was on the third episode of Hanna-Barbera's The New Scooby-Doo Movies, \"Scooby-Doo Meets the Addams Family\", which first aired on CBS Saturday morning, on September 23, 1972. Four members of the original cast (John Astin, Carolyn Jones, Jackie Coogan, and Ted Cassidy) returned for the special, which involved the Addamses in a mystery with the Scooby-Doo gang. The Addams Family characters were drawn to the specifications of the original Charles Addams cartoons. After the episode aired, fans wanted more animated adventures featuring the Addamses, and Hanna-Barbera obliged.\n\nIn 1992, a live-action remake of the series was produced, The Addams Family, which was followed by a sequel, Addams Family Values, in 1993. Loosened content restrictions allowed the films to use far more grotesque humor that strove to keep the Addams cartoons' original spirit. The two films used the same cast, except for Grandmama, played by Judith Malina and Carol Kane in the first and second films, respectively. A script for a third film was prepared in 1994, but was abandoned after the sudden death of actor Raul Julia that year.\n\nIn 1998, a direct-to-video film, Addams Family Reunion, was released. This film was not related to the Paramount movies and was instead a full-length pilot for a second live-action television version, The New Addams Family. The movie follows the style of Raul Julia, while the new sitcom's Gomez, played by Glenn Taranto, is played in the style of John Astin.\n\nIn 2010, it was announced that Illumination Entertainment, in partnership with Universal Pictures, had acquired the underlying rights to the Addams Family drawings. The film was planned to be a stop-motion animated film based on Charles Addams's original drawings. Tim Burton was set to co-write and co-produce the film, with a possibility to direct. However, in 2013, it was reported that the film was cancelled.\n\nIn 2019, it was announced in Variety that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer would be reviving The Addams Family as an animated film with Pamela Pettler to write the screenplay and Andrew Mittman and Kevin Miserocchi to executive produce the film. By 2017, Conrad Vernon had been hired to direct the film, which he would also produce along with Berman and Alex Schwartz, based on a screenplay written by Pettler, with revisions by Matt Lieberman. The film was released on October 11, 2019. In 2020, MGM announced that a sequel was in the works, with an announcement trailer released. The original cast was set to return, with Bill Hader and Javon \"Wanna\" Walton joining the cast as new characters.\n\nHomages and adaptations\n\nTen video games were released from 1989 to 2021 based on The Addams Family. A pinball game by Midway (under the Bally label) was released in 1992 shortly after the movie. It is the best-selling pinball game of all time.\n\nA novelization of the television series, written by Jack Sharkey, was released near the end of the show's second season. The book details the family's arrival in their new home and explains how it got its bizarre décor. The arrival and origins of Thing are explained. Each chapter reads as a self-contained story, like episodes of the television show. The novel concludes with the Addams family discovering that their lives will be the basis for a new television series.\n\nA musical inspired by The Addams Family drawings by Charles Addams was being developed for the Broadway stage in 2007. Broadway veterans Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice wrote the book, and Andrew Lippa wrote the score. Julian Crouch and Phelim McDermott (Improbable theatre founders) directed and designed the production, with choreography by Sergio Trujillo.\n\nCast and characters\n\nThe family has had a profound influence on American comics, cinema, and television. They have also been seen as an inspiration for the goth subculture and its fashion. According to The Telegraph, the Addamses \"are one of the most iconic families in American history, up there with the Kennedys.\" Similarly, Time has compared \"the relevance and the cultural reach\" of the family with those of the Kennedys and the Roosevelts, \"so much a part of the American landscape that it's difficult to discuss the country's history without mentioning them.\" For TV Guide, which listed the characters in the top ten of the \"60 greatest TV families of all time,\" the Addamses \"provided the design for cartoonish clans to come, like the Flintstones and the Simpsons.\" Owing to their popularity, the first feature-length adaptation has been identified as a \"cult film,\" while Addams Family Values was listed as one of the \"50 best family films\" by The Guardian and nominated for the American Film Institute's '100 Years .. 100 Laughs' at the turn of the century. Ricci's portrayal of Wednesday in the film series was ranked one of the \"100 greatest movie characters\" by Empire, and in 2011 AOL named Morticia one of the \"100 most memorable female TV characters.\"\n\nLegacy\n\nThe Addams Family has had a profound influence on American comics, cinema, and television. They have also been seen as an inspiration for the goth subculture and its fashion. The family's eccentric and macabre lifestyle has become a cultural touchstone, with references to them appearing in popular culture. The family's legacy extends beyond their original adaptations, with their influence visible in many other works of fiction.

professional basketball player who has played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) since 2010. Born on March 16, 1989, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Griffin is a power forward and has played for the Los Angeles Clippers, Detroit Pistons, and Brooklyn Nets.\n\nEarly Life\n\nGriffin was born to Tommy Griffin, who is of Afro-Haitian descent, and Gail Griffin, who is white. His father was a basketball center and track standout at Northwestern Oklahoma State University. Griffin and his older brother, Taylor Griffin, were home-schooled by their mother from first grade until Taylor was in the tenth grade and Blake was in eighth. Growing up, Griffin was good friends with future NFL quarterback Sam Bradford. Bradford's father owned a gym where Blake and Taylor played basketball. Before deciding to focus on basketball, Griffin also played baseball as a first baseman and football as a wide receiver, safety, and tight end.\n\nHigh School Career\n\nIn 2003, Griffin followed his brother to Oklahoma Christian School, where they played under their father, head coach Tommy Griffin. They played together during the 2003–04 and 2004–05 high school seasons, winning two state basketball championships. In his freshman year, the Oklahoma Christian Saints posted a perfect 29–0 season and won the Class 3A boys state championship game at the State Fair Arena against Riverside Indian School, 55–50.\n\nCollege Career\n\nGriffin was one of the highest-rated and most decorated recruits ever at Oklahoma. As a freshman at Oklahoma, he averaged 14.7 points and 9.1 rebounds and led the Sooners to a 23–12 record. He ranked ninth in scoring, fourth in rebounding, and third in field goal percentage in the Big 12 Conference. In a game against the Kansas Jayhawks, he suffered a sprained medial collateral ligament (MCL) in his left knee five minutes into the game. Less than two months after injuring his left knee, he injured his right knee in a home victory against Texas A&M. The injury this time was torn cartilage, and he had arthroscopic surgery on March 2, 2008. He missed the following game, a victory over in-state rival Oklahoma State Cowboys, but was back on the court a week after the injury with 14 points and eight rebounds in a win versus Missouri.\n\nGriffin was a first-team all-district pick by the USBWA and NABC, and was named to the Big 12 All-Rookie Team and to the first-team All-Big 12 selection by league coaches and Associated Press. He became the first Sooner to make the conference All-Rookie team since Wayman Tisdale in 1983 for the Big Eight Conference. He was expected to be a lottery pick in the 2008 NBA draft but decided to return to college to give himself time to mature physically and try to help Oklahoma win the NCAA championship.\n\nSophomore Season\n\nIn Griffin's sophomore season, the Sooners started out the season winning their first 12 games before falling to the Arkansas Razorbacks. In the third game of the season, in a win against the Davidson Wildcats, he scored 25 points and grabbed 21 rebounds. The very next game, he had 35 points and 21 rebounds against Gardner–Webb, becoming the first player in Big 12 history to record back-to-back games of at least 20 points and 20 rebounds. This earned him three consecutive Big 12 player of the week honors and finished the season with a record-tying six player of the week honors. In a home victory against the Texas Tech Red Raiders, he set career-bests for both points and rebounds with 40 points and 23 rebounds, becoming the only player in Big 12 history and the third player in the history of the University of Oklahoma men's basketball program to record at least 40 points and 20 rebounds in a game, joining Wayman Tisdale (61 points and 22 rebounds in 1983) and Alvan Adams (43 points and 25 rebounds in 1975).\n\nProfessional Career\n\nOn April 7, 2009, Griffin announced that he would give up his final two years of eligibility and declared for the NBA draft after his sophomore year.

He is a member of the Democratic Party and has been a prominent advocate for progressive policies, including expanding Medicaid, increasing access to healthcare, and addressing issues related to racial justice and equality.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nRaphael Warnock was born on July 23, 1969, in Savannah, Georgia. He grew up in a family of 12 children, with his parents, Verlene and Jonathan Warnock, both serving as Pentecostal pastors. His father served in the U.S. Army during World War II, where he learned automobile mechanics and welding, and subsequently opened a small car restoration business. His mother picked cotton and tobacco in the summers in Waycross, Georgia, as a teenager and became a pastor.\n\nWarnock began his ministry as an intern and licentiate at the Sixth Avenue Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, under the civil rights movement leader John Thomas Porter. In the 1990s, he served as youth pastor and then assistant pastor at Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York. During his time at Abyssinian, the church declined to hire workfare recipients as part of organized opposition to then-mayor Rudy Giuliani's workfare program.\n\n**Religious Work**\n\nWarnock's experience in the church has had a significant impact on his views on social justice and equality. He has been a vocal critic of inequality and has advocated for policies that promote social and economic justice. In a 2018 sermon, he discussed Israel's shooting of nonviolent Palestinian protesters, comparing the Palestinian cause to the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\n**Political Activism**\n\nWarnock came to prominence in Georgia politics as a leader in the campaign to expand Medicaid in the state. In 2013, he wrote an editorial for the Atlanta Journal Constitution that criticized Governor Nathan Deal for not supporting an integrated prom at the Wilcox County High School. In March 2014, Warnock led a sit-in at the Georgia State Capitol to press state legislators to accept the expansion of Medicaid offered by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. He and other leaders were arrested during the protest.\n\n**U.S. Senate**\n\nIn January 2020, Warnock decided to run in the 2020 special election for the United States Senate seat held by Kelly Loeffler, who was appointed after Johnny Isakson's resignation.

He was endorsed by Democratic senators Chuck Schumer, Cory Booker, Sherrod Brown, Kirsten Gillibrand, Jeff Merkley, Chris Murphy, Bernie Sanders, Brian Schatz, and Elizabeth Warren; the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Stacey Abrams, and former presidents Barack Obama and Jimmy Carter.\n\n**Elections**\n\nWarnock won the special election in January 2021, defeating Loeffler by a margin of 51.5% to 48.5%. He became the first African American senator from Georgia and the first Democrat to hold the seat since 2005.\n\n**Tenure**\n\nOn January 20, 2021, Warnock was sworn into the United States Senate in the 117th Congress by Vice President Kamala Harris.

{"title": "Proud_Boys", "content": "\nHistory and organization\nGavin McInnes co-founded Vice magazine in 1994, but was pushed out in 2008 due to \"creative differences\" After leaving, he began \"doggedly hacking a jagged but unrelenting path to the far-right fringes of American culture\", according to a 2017 profile in the Canadian Globe and Mail [36] The Proud Boys organization was launched in September 2016, on the website of Taki's Magazine, a far-right publication for which white nationalist Richard B Spencer had once served as executive editor [37] It existed informally before then as a group centered around McInnes, and the first gathering of the Brooklyn chapter in July 2016 resulted in a brawl in the bar where they met [38]\n\n\nMembership and doctrine\nThe total number of Proud Boys members is unknown Reports estimate membership between several hundred up to 6,000 [70] [71] [72] In July 2018, the Proud Boys L.A branch had 160 members and up to 300 pending applicants, according to the unidentified Proud Boys L.A president [73]\n\n\nGender and sexuality\nWomen and trans men are not allowed to join the Proud Boys, [37] and the unnamed president of Proud Boys L.A told the Los Angeles Times the group admits only \"biological men\" [73]\n\n\nLeadership\nGavin McInnes founded the group and served as its leader [83] [84] After the designation of a number of Proud Boys members as extremists with ties to white nationalism, [57] McInnes said that his lawyers had advised him that quitting might help the nine Proud Boys members being prosecuted for the incidents in October [clarification needed] During the announcement he defended the group, attacked the reporting about it, said white nationalists do not exist, and at times he said things that made it appear he was not quitting, such as \"this is 100% a legal gesture, and it is 100% about alleviating sentencing,  [it was a] stepping down gesture, in quotation marks.\" [85] [86]\n\n\nConnection with Roger Stone\nIn early 2018, ahead of an appearance at the annual Republican Dorchester Conference in Salem, Oregon, Roger Stone sought out the Proud Boys to act as his \"security\" for the event; photos posted online showed Stone drinking with several Proud Boys [95] [96] [97]\n\n\n2020 presidential debate\nIn the first 2020 presidential debate on September 29, 2020, President Donald Trump was asked by moderator Chris Wallace: \"Are you willing, tonight, to condemn white supremacists and militia groups, and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities as we saw in Kenosha, and as we have seen in Portland?\" Trump replied: \"Sure Sure, I am willing to do that.\" He then asked for clarification, saying: \"Who would you like me to condemn?\" Wallace mentioned \"white supremacists and right wing militia\" During the exchange, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden replied \"Proud Boys\" and Trump replied: \"Proud Boys, stand back and stand by, but I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, somebody's got to do something about antifa and the left, because this is not a right-wing problem.\" [106] Shortly after, Joe Biggs, one of the Proud Boys organizers, shared through his Parler social media account a logo with the president's words \"Stand back\" and \"Stand by\" [107]\n\n\nForeign disinformation during the 2020 presidential campaign\nDuring the 2020 presidential campaign in October, threatening emails claiming to be from the Proud Boys were sent to Democratic voters in Alaska, Arizona, Florida and Pennsylvania, the last three of which were swing states in the upcoming election The emails warned: \"You will vote for Trump on Election Day or we will come after you.\" Proud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio denied the group's involvement and said he had spoken to the FBI about it Tarrio told The Washington Post that \" [t]wo weeks ago I believe we had Google Cloud services drop us from their platform, so then we initiated a url transfer, which is still in process We kind of just never used it.\" [115] Miami New Times reported that the emails came from info@proudboysofficial.com, one of two websites belonging to the Proud Boys, and which Tarrio said had not been updated in a year and a half Tarrio added that an authentic email from the Proud Boys would come from proudboysusa.com [116] The FBI announced that Iranian intelligence was responsible for the spoofed emails sent to intimidate Florida voters, and added that Russia was also working to influence the election Officials from each country denied the accusations [117]\n\n\nActivities and events\nAt the 2017 March 4 Trump rally in Berkeley, California, Kyle Chapman was recorded hitting a counter-protester over the head with a wooden dowel Images of Chapman went viral, and the Proud Boys organized a crowdfunding campaign for Chapman's bail after his arrest After this, McInnes invited Chapman to become involved with the Proud Boys, through which he formed the Fraternal Order of the Alt-Knights [53] On April 15, 2017, an alt-right rally was organized in Berkeley by the Liberty Revival Alliance, which did not seek or receive a permit, and was attended by members of the Proud Boys, Identity Evropa (an American neo-Nazi group) [118] [119] [120] and Oath Keepers [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] Many of these people traveled to Berkeley from other parts of the country The rally was counter-protested and violence broke out, resulting in 21 people being arrested [126] [127]\n\n\n2017–2018\nAt the 2017 March 4 Trump rally in

out, resulting in 21 people being arrested [126] [127]\n\n\n2018 Metropolitan Republican Club Incident\nIn October 2018, McInnes gave a talk at the Metropolitan Republican Club on the Upper East Side of Manhattan [140] [141] He stepped out of his car wearing glasses with Asian eyes drawn on the front and pulled a samurai sword out of its sheath Police forced him inside Later, inside the event, McInnes and an Asian member of the Proud Boys re-enacted the 1960 assassination of Inejirō Asanuma, the leader of the Japanese Socialist Party; a captioned photograph of the actual assassination had become a meme in alt-right social media [37] The audience for the event was described by The New York Times as \"a cross-section of New York's far-right subculture: libertarians, conspiracy theorists and nationalists who have coalesced around their opposition to Islam, feminism and liberal politics.\" [142]\n\n\nProtestors\nAnti-fascist activists had started protesting outside the club before the event and had reportedly engaged in vandalism Following cross-provocations between the opposing sides, the Proud Boys charged towards the protesters, who threw a bottle in response, resulting in a fight [142] [143] NYC police present at the protest reportedly did not respond [37] [144]\n\n\nIncident\nVideo evidence from three separate videos showed conclusively that the Proud Boys had instigated the fight after the Metropolitan Republican Club event [145] [146] John Miller, New York City's deputy police commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism, said that \"incidents like  [the post-MRC fight] make it more likely\" that the Proud Boys would be \"higher on the radar\" of authorities [142]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe fallout from the incident left the group in internal disarray [142] After McInnes nominally left the group, the \"Elder Chapter\" of the group reportedly assumed control Jason Lee Van Dyke, the group's lawyer, was appointed as the chapter's chairman [87] [153] Van Dyke was previously known for suing news media and anti-fascist activists for reporting on the group, and for making violent online threats with racist language [154] [155]\n\n\n2019 Demand Free Speech rally\nA Proud Boys rally called Demand Free Speech [156] took place on July 6, 2019, in Washington, D.C.'s Freedom Plaza and Pershing Park, drawing about 250 people [157] [158] [159] McInnes, Laura Loomer and Milo Yiannopoulos appeared, while former Trump advisor Roger Stone and Jacob Wohl did not A counter-protest and dance party across the street drew more people than the main rally Police said there were only minor skirmishes between the far-right and antifa, and no arrests were made [157] [158] [159]\n\n\nEnd Domestic Terrorism rally 2019\nThe Proud Boys and Joe Biggs organized an August 17, 2019, demonstration in Portland attended by members of several far-right groups [160] [161] [162] The End Domestic Terrorism rally, [162] which was sometimes subtitled \"Better Dead than Red\", [163] was intended to promote the idea that antifa should be classified as \"domestic terrorism\" It received national attention, including a tweet from President Trump [164] [165] One day prior to the rally, Patriot Prayer's Joey Gibson, who had organized similar events in 2017 and 2018, was taken into custody on charges of felony rioting during a May 1, 2019, incident [166] The Proud Boys organized the August event in response to a video that went viral of masked demonstrators assaulting conservative blogger Andy Ngo at a Portland rally on June 29, 2019 [166] The End Domestic Terrorism event drew more counter-demonstrators than participants (at least one group urged its members in advance to not attend) and ended with the Proud Boys' requesting a police escort to leave [161]\n\n\n2020 COVID-19 misinformation\nLike other far-right groups, the Proud Boys have shown interest in making common cause with the anti-vaccination movement, presumably for recruiting and fundraising purposes [167] [168]\n\n\nAnti-BLM protests\nIn January 2020, the Proud Boys attended a large Second Amendment rally in Richmond, Virginia They are opposed to Black Lives Matter protests and see attempts to remove statues of Confederate leaders and other historical figures as a \"left-wing plot to destroy American history\" [170]\n\n\n2020 church attacks\nOn December 12, 2020, Ashbury United Methodist Church, the oldest historically black church in Washington, D.C., was targeted by Enrique Tarrio and the Proud Boys after pro-Trump protests earlier that day [179] They flashed white supremacist hand signs and tore down and burned a Black Lives Matter sign that had been raised by the church [180] Police said that more than three dozen people were arrested and four churches were vandalized [181] Reverend Ianther M Mills, the church's pastor, described the acts as \"reminiscent of cross burnings\" and expressed sadness that local police had failed to intervene [182] Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio claimed responsibility for the incident, which police have designated a hate crime [183]\n\n\nParticipation in the January 6 United States Capitol attack\nMembers of the Proud Boys participated in the attack on the United States Capitol building on January 6, 2021, [189] where some members of the group appeared wearing orange hats [190] Some members wore all black clothing, rather than their usual black and yellow attire, as Tarrio had suggested in a Parler post days earlier, which prosecutors said was an apparent reference to mimicking the appearance of antifa members [191] A review by The Wall Street Journal of social media posts from Proud Boys members showed that the group repeatedly invoked Trump's messages as a call to action, [192] and were disheartened by the arrests and what they perceived to be Trump's lack of action in the days leading up to Joe Biden's inauguration [193]\n\n\nIndictments for conspiracy\nThe Justice Department announced on February 3, 2021, that two Proud Boys members had been indicted for conspiracy [35] Five more individuals affiliated with the Proud Boys were charged with conspiracy on February 11, followed by six more on February 26 [228] [229] [230] Federal grand jury conspiracy indictments of others followed [231] Federal prosecutors considered pursuing charges under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, typically used to prosecute organized crime syndicates [232]\n\n\nConvictions for seditious conspiracy\nThe trial, originally scheduled for August 8, 2022, was postponed to wait for relevant interview transcripts from the January 6 House committee (The committee intended to write its own final report before sharing its witness testimony with the Justice Department, and thus neither the prosecutors nor the defendants' counsel expected to have access to the material until later in the year.) Two defendants motioned to reschedule the August trial, and the government consented as long as all five defendants would be tried together in December [263] [264] [261] [219] [265] [238] Meanwhile, in October, the government extended a plea offer to all five men, which they rejected [266]\n\n\nPost-2021 actions\nFollowing the 2021 Capitol attack, Enrique Tarrio was discovered to have been an informant to both federal and local law enforcement between 2012 and 2014 [274] [275] The Proud Boys of Alabama officially stated on Telegram regarding Tarrio, \"We reject and disavow the proven federal informant, Enrique Tarrio, and any and all chapters that choose to associate with him.\" [276]\n\n\nAlabama\nFollowing the 2021 Capitol attack, Enrique Tarrio was discovered to have been an

where they clashed with antifa counter-demonstrators [277] Alan Swinney, a Proud Boy from Texas, attended the George Floyd march in Portland, Oregon where he \"calmly and dispassionately used or threatened force\" by spraying marchers with mace, shooting random people with a paint ball gun, (causing one marcher to lose an eye) and threatening others with a loaded gun  He was found guilty of attempted assault, second-degree unlawful use of mace, and pointing a firearm and was sentenced to 10 years in prison [278] [279]\n\n\nFlorida\nSeveral members of the Proud Boys have served on the

children's Drag Queen Story Time event at the San Lorenzo Library Members of the Drag Queen Story Hour described the group as reportedly \"extremely aggressive\", who \"totally freaked out the kids\" by shouting homophobic and transphobic slurs during the event Sheriff's office is investigating the attack as a possible hate crime [282] [283]\n\n\nSplit with neo-Nazis\nIn June 2023, the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism reported that 10 Proud Boy chapters, mainly sympathetic to neo-Nazi ideas, split with the national organization after a fight broke out on June 25 between a dozen members of the Proud Boys and the neo-Nazi Rose City Nationalists [284]\n\n\nTrump conviction\nMultiple chapters of the Proud Boys condemned the conviction of Donald Trump A telegram message from one chapter simply said \"War.\" in response to the conviction, while another called for supporters to respond and fight, also referencing Francisco Franco [285]\n\n\nResponse\nIn late November 2018, an internal memo from the Clark County Sheriff's Office showed that the FBI had designated the Proud Boys an extremist group, but it later clarified that only certain members were extremist threats with ties to white nationalism [54] [55]\n\n\nGovernment\nIn late November 2018, an internal memo from the Clark County Sheriff's Office showed that the FBI had designated the Proud Boys an extremist

Terrorism Suppression Act [297]\n\n\nSouthern Poverty Law Center lawsuit\nAlthough he had supposedly cut his ties with the Proud Boys by November 2018, stepping down as chairman, [85] [86] McInnes filed a defamation lawsuit in February 2019 against the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) in federal court in Alabama over the SPLC's designation of the Proud Boys as a \"general hate\" group [298] [299] The SPLC took the lawsuit \"as a compliment\" and an indication that \"we're doing our job.\" [300] On its website, the SPLC said that \"McInnes plays a duplicitous rhetorical game: rejecting white nationalism and, in particular, the term 'alt-right' while espousing some of its central tenets\" and that the group's \"rank-and-file  [members] and leaders regularly spout white nationalist memes and maintain affiliations with known extremists They are known for anti-Muslim and misogynistic rhetoric Proud Boys have appeared alongside other hate groups at extremist gatherings like the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville.\" [39] [299] McInnes is represented by Ronald Coleman In addition to defamation, McInnes claimed tortious interference with economic advantage, \"false light invasion of privacy\" and \"aiding and abetting employment discrimination.\" [301] The day after filing the suit, McInnes announced that he had been re-hired by the Canadian far-right media group The Rebel Media [302] The SPLC filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in April 2019 [303]\n\n\nLawsuits\nOn May 17, 2019, Bill Burke of Ohio filed a $3 million lawsuit against the Proud Boys, Kessler, and

"article": "# Introduction\n\nThe Proud Boys are a far-right, neo-fascist organization that originated in the United States in 2016. The group is known for its white nationalist and misogynistic ideology, as well as its violent and extremist behavior. The Proud Boys have been involved in numerous high-profile incidents, including the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and the 2020 storming of the United States Capitol. This article will provide an in-depth overview of the Proud Boys, their ideology, and their activities.\n\n## History and Organization\n\nThe Proud Boys were founded in 2016 by Gavin McInnes, a Canadian far-right activist and co-founder of the men's magazine Vice. McInnes had been involved in various far-right and nationalist groups before founding the Proud Boys, and the group's ideology is heavily influenced by his views. The Proud Boys initially existed as a loose network of like-minded individuals, but they eventually formalized into a more structured organization with chapters in various cities across the United States and Canada.\n\n## Membership and Doctrine\n\nThe total number of Proud Boys members is unknown, but estimates range from several hundred to 6,000. The group is known for its exclusivity, and membership is typically limited to men who are deemed to be \"patriotic\" and \"white.\" Women and trans men are not allowed to join the Proud Boys, and the group's ideology is heavily influenced by white nationalist and misogynistic views. The Proud Boys' doctrine is centered around the idea of a \"western chauvinist\" movement, which emphasizes the superiority of Western culture and the importance of white identity.\n\n## Leadership\n\nGavin McInnes founded the Proud Boys and served as its leader until 2018, when he stepped down due to internal conflicts and allegations of ties to white nationalism. McInnes was replaced by Enrique Tarrio, a Proud Boys leader who was later revealed to be an informant for both federal and local law enforcement. Tarrio has since become a key figure in the Proud Boys, and his leadership has been marked by controversy and violence.\n\n## Connection with Roger Stone\n\nIn early 2018, Roger Stone, a prominent Trump advisor, sought out the Proud Boys to act as his \"security\" for an event in Oregon. Photos posted online showed Stone drinking with several Proud Boys, and the incident highlighted the group's connections to high-profile figures in the Trump administration.\n\n## 2020 Presidential Debate\n\nDuring the first 2020 presidential debate, President Donald Trump was asked to condemn white supremacists and militia groups. Trump replied that he was willing to do so, but then asked for clarification on who he should condemn. When Democratic candidate Joe Biden mentioned the Proud Boys, Trump replied \"Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.\" The incident sparked widespread controversy and accusations that Trump was endorsing the group.\n\n## Foreign Disinformation during the 2020 Presidential Campaign\n\nDuring the 2020 presidential campaign, threatening emails claiming to be from the Proud Boys were sent to Democratic voters in several states. The emails warned that recipients would face violence if they did not vote for Trump. The Proud Boys' chairman, Enrique Tarrio, denied the group's involvement, but the incident highlighted the group's use of disinformation and intimidation tactics.\n\n## Activities and Events\n\nThe Proud Boys have been involved in numerous high-profile incidents, including the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and the 2020 storming of the United States Capitol. The group has also been involved in various street fights and clashes with anti-fascist groups.\n\n## 2017 March 4 Trump Rally\n\nThe Proud Boys were involved in a violent clash with anti-fascist protesters during the 2017 March 4 Trump rally in Berkeley, California.

The event was marked by minor skirmishes between the Proud Boys and anti-fascist protesters.\n\n## End Domestic Terrorism Rally 2019\n\nThe Proud Boys and Joe Biggs organized a demonstration in Portland, Oregon in August 2019, which was intended to promote the idea that antifa should be classified as \"domestic terrorism.\" The event drew several hundred counter-demonstrators and ended with the Proud Boys requesting a police escort to leave.\n\n## 2020 Church Attacks\n\nOn December 12, 2020, the Proud Boys targeted Ashbury United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C. after pro-Trump protests earlier that day.

hacking a jagged but unrelenting path to the far-right fringes of American culture\", according to a 2017 profile in the Canadian Globe and Mail [36] The Proud Boys organization was launched in September 2016, on the website of Taki's Magazine, a far-right publication for which white nationalist Richard B Spencer had once served as executive editor [37] It existed informally before then as a group centered around McInnes, and the first gathering of the Brooklyn chapter in July 2016 resulted in a brawl in the bar where they met [38]\n\n\nMembership and doctrine\nThe total number of Proud Boys members is unknown Reports estimate membership between several hundred up to 6,000 [70] [71] [72] In July 2018, the Proud Boys L.A branch had 160 members and up to 300 pending applicants,

members as extremists with ties to white nationalism, [57] McInnes said that his lawyers had advised him that quitting might help the nine Proud Boys members being prosecuted for the incidents in October [clarification needed] During the announcement he defended the group, attacked the reporting about it, said white nationalists do not exist, and at times he said things that made it appear he was not quitting, such as \"this is 100% a legal gesture, and it is 100% about alleviating sentencing,  [it was a] stepping down gesture, in quotation marks.\" [85] [86]\n\n\nConnection with Roger Stone\nIn early 2018, ahead of an appearance at the annual Republican Dorchester Conference in Salem, Oregon, Roger Stone sought out the Proud Boys to act as his \"security\" for the event; photos

by moderator Chris Wallace: \"Are you willing, tonight, to condemn white supremacists and militia groups, and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities as we saw in Kenosha, and as we have seen in Portland?\" Trump replied: \"Sure Sure, I am willing to do that.\" He then asked for clarification, saying: \"Who would you like me to condemn?\" Wallace mentioned \"white supremacists and right wing militia\" During the exchange, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden replied \"Proud Boys\" and Trump replied: \"Proud Boys, stand back and stand by, but I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, somebody's got to do something about antifa and the left, because this is not a right-wing problem.\" [106] Shortly after, Joe Biggs, one of the Proud Boys organizers, shared through his Parler social media account a logo with the president's words \"Stand back\" and \"Stand by\" [107]\n\n\nForeign disinformation during the 2020 presidential campaign\nDuring the 2020 presidential campaign in October, threatening emails claiming to be from the Proud Boys were sent to Democratic voters in Alaska, Arizona, Florida and Pennsylvania, the last three of which were swing states in the upcoming election The emails warned: \"You will vote for Trump on Election Day or we will come after you.\" Proud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio denied the group's involvement and said he had spoken to the FBI about it Tarrio told The Washington Post that \" [t]wo weeks ago I believe we had Google Cloud services drop us from their platform, so then we initiated a url transfer, which is still in process We kind of just never used it.\" [115] Miami New Times reported that the emails came from info@proudboysofficial.com, one of two websites belonging to the Proud Boys, and which Tarrio said had not been updated in a year and a half Tarrio added that an authentic email from the Proud Boys would come from proudboysusa.com [116] The FBI announced that Iranian intelligence was responsible for the spoofed emails sent to intimidate Florida voters, and added that Russia was also working to influence the election Officials from each country denied the accusations [117]\n\n\nActivities and events\nAt the 2017 March 4 Trump rally in Berkeley, California, Kyle Chapman was recorded hitting a counter-protester over the head with a wooden dowel Images of Chapman went viral, and the Proud Boys organized a crowdfunding campaign for Chapman's bail after his arrest After this, McInnes invited Chapman to become involved with the Proud Boys, through which he formed the Fraternal Order of the Alt-Knights [53] On April 15, 2017, an alt-right rally was organized in Berkeley by the Liberty Revival Alliance, which did not seek or receive a permit, and was attended by members of the Proud Boys, Identity Evropa (an American neo-Nazi group) [118] [119] [120] and Oath Keepers [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] Many of these people traveled to Berkeley from other parts of the country The rally was counter-protested and violence broke out, resulting in 21 people being arrested [126] [127]\n\n\n2017–2018\nAt the 2017 March 4 Trump rally in Berkeley, California, Kyle Chapman was recorded hitting a counter-protester over the head with a wooden dowel Images of Chapman went viral, and the Proud Boys organized a crowdfunding campaign for Chapman's bail after his arrest After this, McInnes invited Chapman to become involved with the Proud Boys, through which he formed the Fraternal Order of the Alt-Knights [53] On April 15, 2017, an

out, resulting in 21 people being arrested [126] [127]\n\n\n2018 Metropolitan Republican Club Incident\nIn October 2018, McInnes gave a talk at the Metropolitan Republican Club on the Upper East Side of Manhattan [140] [141] He stepped out of his car wearing glasses with Asian eyes drawn on the front and pulled a samurai sword out of its sheath Police forced him inside Later, inside the event, McInnes and an Asian member of the Proud Boys re-enacted the 1960 assassination of Inejirō Asanuma, the leader of the Japanese Socialist Party; a captioned photograph of the actual assassination had become a meme in alt-right social media [37] The audience for the event was described by The New York Times as \"a cross-section of New York's far-right subculture: libertarians, conspiracy theorists and nationalists who have coalesced around their opposition to Islam, feminism and liberal politics.\" [142]\n\n\nProtestors\nAnti-fascist activists had started protesting outside the club before the event and had reportedly engaged in vandalism Following cross-provocations between the opposing sides, the Proud Boys charged towards the protesters, who threw a bottle in response, resulting in a fight [142] [143] NYC police present at the protest reportedly did not respond [37] [144]\n\n\nIncident\nVideo evidence from three separate videos showed conclusively that the Proud Boys had instigated the fight after the Metropolitan Republican Club event [145] [146] John Miller, New York City's deputy police commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism, said that \"incidents like  [the post-MRC fight] make it more likely\" that the Proud Boys would be \"higher on the radar\" of authorities [142]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe fallout from the incident left the group in internal disarray [142] After McInnes nominally left the group, the \"Elder Chapter\" of the group reportedly assumed control Jason Lee Van Dyke, the group's lawyer, was appointed as the chapter's chairman [87] [153] Van Dyke was previously known for suing news media and anti-fascist activists for reporting on the group, and for making violent online threats with racist language [154] [155]\n\n\n2019 Demand Free Speech rally\nA Proud Boys rally called Demand Free Speech [156] took place on July 6, 2019, in Washington, D.C.'s Freedom Plaza and Pershing Park, drawing about 250 people [157] [158] [159] McInnes, Laura Loomer and Milo Yiannopoulos appeared, while former Trump advisor Roger Stone and Jacob Wohl did not A counter-protest and dance party across the street drew more people than the main rally Police said there were only minor skirmishes between the far-right and antifa, and no arrests were made [157] [158] [159]\n\n\nEnd Domestic Terrorism rally 2019\nThe Proud Boys and Joe Biggs organized an August 17, 2019, demonstration in Portland attended by members of several far-right groups [160] [161] [162] The End Domestic Terrorism rally, [162] which was sometimes subtitled \"Better Dead than Red\", [163] was intended to promote the idea that antifa should be classified as \"domestic terrorism\" It received national attention, including a tweet from President Trump [164] [165] One day prior to the rally, Patriot Prayer's Joey Gibson, who had organized similar events in 2017 and 2018, was taken into custody on charges of felony rioting during a May 1, 2019, incident [166] The Proud Boys organized the August event in response to a video that went viral of masked demonstrators assaulting conservative blogger Andy Ngo at a Portland rally on June 29, 2019 [166] The End Domestic Terrorism event drew more counter-demonstrators than participants (at least one group urged its members in advance to not attend) and ended with the Proud Boys' requesting a police escort to leave [161]\n\n\n2020 COVID-19 misinformation\nLike other far-right groups, the Proud Boys have shown interest in making common cause with the anti-vaccination movement, presumably for recruiting and fundraising purposes [167] [168]\n\n\nAnti-BLM protests\nIn January 2020, the Proud Boys attended a large Second Amendment rally in Richmond, Virginia They are opposed to Black Lives Matter protests and see attempts to remove statues of Confederate leaders and other historical figures as a \"left-wing plot to destroy American history\" [170]\n\n\n2020 church attacks\nOn December 12, 2020, Ashbury United Methodist Church, the oldest historically black church in Washington, D.C., was targeted by Enrique Tarrio and the Proud Boys after pro-Trump protests earlier that day [179] They flashed white supremacist hand signs and tore down and burned a Black Lives Matter sign that had been raised by the church [180] Police said that more than three dozen people were arrested and four churches were vandalized [181] Reverend Ianther M Mills, the church's pastor, described the acts as \"reminiscent of cross burnings\" and expressed sadness that local police had failed to intervene [182] Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio claimed responsibility for the incident, which police have designated a hate crime [183]\n\n\nParticipation in the January 6 United States Capitol attack\nMembers of the Proud Boys participated in the attack on the United States Capitol building on January 6, 2021, [189] where some members of the group appeared wearing orange hats [190] Some members wore all black clothing, rather than their usual black and yellow attire, as Tarrio had suggested in a Parler post days earlier, which prosecutors said was an apparent reference to mimicking the appearance of antifa members [191] A review by The Wall Street Journal of social media posts from Proud Boys members showed that the group repeatedly invoked Trump's messages as a call to action, [192] and were disheartened by the arrests and what they perceived to be Trump's lack of action in the days leading up to Joe Biden's inauguration [193]\n\n\nIndictments for conspiracy\nThe Justice Department announced on February 3, 2021, that two Proud Boys members had been indicted for conspiracy [35] Five more individuals affiliated with the Proud Boys were charged with conspiracy on February 11, followed by six more on February 26 [228] [229] [230] Federal grand jury conspiracy indictments of others followed [231] Federal prosecutors considered pursuing charges under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, typically used to prosecute organized crime syndicates [232]\n\n\nConvictions for seditious conspiracy\nThe trial, originally scheduled for August 8, 2022, was postponed to wait for relevant interview transcripts from the January 6 House committee (The committee intended to write its own final report before sharing its witness testimony with the Justice Department, and thus neither the prosecutors nor the defendants' counsel expected to have access to the material until later in the year.) Two defendants motioned to reschedule the August trial, and the government consented as long as all five defendants would be tried together in December [263] [264] [261] [219] [265] [238] Meanwhile, in October, the government extended a plea offer to all five men, which they rejected [266]\n\n\nPost-2021 actions\nFollowing the 2021 Capitol attack, Enrique Tarrio was discovered to have been an informant to both federal and local law enforcement between 2012 and 2014 [274] [275] The Proud Boys of Alabama officially stated on Telegram regarding Tarrio, \"We reject and disavow the proven federal informant, Enrique Tarrio, and any and all chapters that choose to associate with him.\" [276]\n\n\nAlabama\nFollowing the 2021 Capitol attack, Enrique Tarrio was discovered to have been an informant to both federal and local law enforcement between 2012 and 2014 [274] [275] The Proud Boys of Alabama officially stated on Telegram regarding Tarrio, \"We reject and disavow the proven federal informant, Enrique Tarrio, and any and all chapters that choose to associate with him.\" [276]\n\n\nPortland, Oregon march\nOn August 23, 2021, the Proud Boys held a rally in Portland, Oregon, where they clashed with antifa counter-demonstrators [277] Alan Swinney, a Proud Boy from Texas, attended the George Floyd march in Portland, Oregon where he \"calmly and dispassionately used or threatened force\" by spraying marchers with mace, shooting random people with a paint ball gun, (causing one marcher to lose an eye) and threatening others with a loaded gun  He was found guilty of attempted assault, second-degree unlawful use of mace, and pointing a firearm and was sentenced to 10 years in prison [278] [279]\n\n\nFlorida\nSeveral members of the Proud Boys have served on the Miami-Dade Republican Executive Committee Proud Boys have frequently participated at conservative events in Florida Other Proud Boys in Florida have run for local office [280] Proud Boy James Hoel was elected to the Sarasota County Republican Executive Committee in 2022 [281]\n\n\nCalifornia\nOn June 12, 2022, a group identified as Proud Boys by the Alameda County Sheriff's Office stormed a children's Drag Queen Story Time event at the San Lorenzo Library Members of the Drag Queen Story Hour described the group as reportedly \"extremely aggressive\", who \"totally freaked out the kids\" by shouting homophobic and transphobic slurs during the event Sheriff's office is investigating the attack as a possible hate crime [282] [283]\n\n\nSplit with neo-Nazis\nIn June 2023, the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism reported that 10 Proud Boy chapters, mainly sympathetic to neo-Nazi ideas, split with the national organization after a fight broke out on June 25 between a dozen members of the Proud Boys and the neo-Nazi Rose City Nationalists [284]\n\n\nTrump conviction\nMultiple chapters of the Proud Boys condemned the conviction of Donald Trump A telegram message from one chapter simply said \"War.\" in response to the conviction, while another called for supporters to respond and fight, also referencing Francisco Franco [285]\n\n\nResponse\nIn late November 2018, an internal memo from the Clark County Sheriff's Office showed that the FBI had designated the Proud Boys an extremist group, but it later clarified that only certain members were extremist threats with ties to white nationalism [54] [55]\n\n\nGovernment\nIn late November 2018, an internal memo from the Clark County Sheriff's Office showed that the FBI had designated the Proud Boys an extremist group, but it later clarified that only certain members were extremist threats with ties to white nationalism [54] [55]\n\n\nUnited States\nIn late November 2018, an internal memo from the Clark County Sheriff's Office showed that the FBI had designated the Proud Boys an extremist group, but it later clarified that only certain members were extremist threats with ties to white nationalism [54] [55]\n\n\nCanada\nBill Blair, Canada's minister of public safety and emergency preparedness, announced in January 2021 that Canada was considering designating the Proud Boys a terrorist organization [286]\n\n\nNew Zealand\nIn late June 2022, Police Commissioner Andrew Coster and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern designated the Proud Boys and another far right group called The Base as terrorist organizations As a result of the terror designation, anyone with property or financial dealings with these organizations face prosecution and up to seven years imprisonment under the Terrorism Suppression Act [297]\n\n\nSouthern Poverty Law Center lawsuit\nAlthough he had supposedly cut his ties with the Proud Boys by November 2018, stepping down as chairman, [85] [86] McInnes filed a defamation lawsuit in February 2019 against the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) in federal court in Alabama over the SPLC's designation of the Proud Boys as a \"general hate\" group [298] [299] The SPLC took the lawsuit \"as a compliment\" and an indication that \"we're doing our job.\" [300] On its website, the SPLC said that \"McInnes plays a duplicitous rhetorical game: rejecting white nationalism and, in particular, the term 'alt-right' while espousing some of its central tenets\" and that the group's \"rank-and-file  [members] and leaders regularly spout white nationalist memes and maintain affiliations with known extremists They are known for anti-Muslim and misogynistic rhetoric Proud Boys have appeared alongside other hate groups at extremist gatherings like the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville.\" [39] [299] McInnes is represented by Ronald Coleman In addition to defamation, McInnes claimed tortious interference with economic advantage, \"false light invasion of privacy\" and \"aiding and abetting employment discrimination.\" [301] The day after filing the suit, McInnes announced that he had been re-hired by the Canadian far-right media group The Rebel Media [302] The SPLC filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in April 2019 [303]\n\n\nLawsuits\nOn May 17, 2019, Bill Burke of Ohio filed a $3 million lawsuit against the Proud Boys, Kessler, and multiple other people and groups associated with the Unite the Right rally Burke was seriously injured in the August 2017 Charlottesville car attack which followed the event [304] [305] The 64-page initial complaint alleges that the named parties \"conspired to plan, promote and carry out the violent events in Charlottesville\" According to Burke, his physical and mental injuries have led to \"severe psychological and emotional suffering\" [306] [307]\n\n\nSocial media bans\nThe Proud Boys organization has been banned by Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube [32]\n\n\nSubgroups\nIn 2017, Kyle Chapman, nicknamed \"Based Stickman\" after the 2017 Berkeley protests, formed a paramilitary wing of the Proud Boys called the Fraternal Order of the Alt-Knights (FOAK) [53] Alt-right figure Augustus Sol Invictus acted as FOAK's second-in-command until he left the group [39]\n\n\nFraternal Order of the Alt-Knights\nIn 2017, Kyle Chapman, nicknamed \"Based Stickman\" after the 2017 Berkeley protests, formed a paramilitary wing of the Proud Boys called the Fraternal Order of the Alt-Knights (FOAK) [53] Alt-right figure Augustus Sol Invictus acted as FOAK's second-in-command until he left the group [39]\n\n\nCanadian chapters\nFollowing the attack on the United States Capitol, the Ottawa and Manitoba chapters shut down [308] On May 2, 2021, Proud Boys Canada announced on the Proud Boys USA channel on Telegram that it has \"officially dissolved\" [309]\n\n\nSymbolism\nMembers of the Proud Boys can be identified by their use of black and yellow Fred Perry polo shirts, American flags, MAGA hats, and military armor Members often carry guns [310] An ironic catchphrase used by Proud Boys is uhuru, which means 'freedom' in the Swahili language [39]\n\n\nAssociation with Fred Perry clothing\nSince the early days of the group, Proud Boys have worn black and yellow polo shirts of the British clothing brand Fred Perry on McInnes' suggestion [312] [313] [314] The brand, having previously been negatively associated with skinheads and the British National Front in the 1970s, [314] issued several public statements distancing themselves from the beliefs of the Proud Boys, and calling on members to stop wearing their clothing [315] [316]\n\n\nMAGA hats\nProud Boys commonly wear red MAGA hats to rallies, often alongside Fred Perry black and yellow polo shirts [319]\n\n\n6MWE\nBy December 15, 2020,  Proud Boy members were being photographed wearing apparel featuring the antisemitic, Neo-Nazi slogan \"6MWE\" [320] The acronym  means \"6 million wasn't enough\", referring to the number of Jewish Holocaust victims The slogan was accompanied by an Eagle symbol used by the Fascist government of Italy supported by Nazi Germany [321]  The image, which spread on Twitter, prompted the Anti-Defamation League to declare that \"Proud Boys' Bigotry is on Full Display\"  [322]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

several Tibetan dialects The English spelling Ladakh is derived from Persian: ladāx [23] [24]\n\n\nHistory\nRock carvings found in many parts of Ladakh indicate that the area has been inhabited from Neolithic times [29] Ladakh's earliest inhabitants consisted of nomads known as Kampa [30] Later settlements were established by Mons from Kullu and Brokpas who originated from Gilgit [30] Around the 1st century, Ladakh was a part of the Kushan Empire Buddhism spread into western Ladakh from Kashmir in the 2nd century The 7th-century Buddhist traveller Xuanzang describes the region in his accounts [31] Xuanzang's term of Ladakh is Mo-lo-so, which has been reconstructed by academics as *Malasa, *Marāsa, or *Mrāsa, which is believed to have been the original name of the region [32]

academics as *Malasa, *Marāsa, or *Mrāsa, which is believed to have been the original name of the region [32] [33]\n\n\nEarly medieval history\nIn the 9th century, Tibet's ruler Langdarma was assassinated and Tibet fragmented Kyide Nyimagon, Langdarma's great-grandson, fled to West Tibet c. 900 CE, and founded a new West Tibetan kingdom at the heart of the old Zhangzhung, now called Ngari in the Tibetan language.\n\n\nMedieval history\nBetween the 1380s and early 1510s, many Islamic missionaries propagated Islam and proselytised the Ladakhi people Sayyid Ali Hamadani, Sayyid Muhammad Nur Baksh and Mir Shamsuddin Iraqi were three important Sufi missionaries who propagated Islam to the locals Mir Sayyid Ali was the first one to make Muslim converts in Ladakh and is often described as the founder of Islam in Ladakh Several mosques were built in Ladakh during this period, including in Mulbhe, Padum and Shey, the capital of Ladakh [39] [40] His principal disciple, Sayyid Muhammad Nur Baksh also propagated Islam to Ladakhis and the Balti people rapidly converted to Islam Noorbakshia Islam is named after him and his followers are only found in Baltistan and Ladakh During his youth, Sultan Zain-ul-Abidin expelled the mystic Sheikh Zain Shahwalli for showing disrespect to him The sheikh then went to Ladakh and proselytised many people to Islam In 1505, Shamsuddin Iraqi, a noted Shia scholar, visited Kashmir and Baltistan He helped in spreading Shia Islam in Kashmir and converted the overwhelming majority of Muslims in Baltistan to his school of thought [40]\n\n\nPrincely state of Jammu and Kashmir\nIn 1834, the Sikh Zorawar Singh, a general of Raja Gulab Singh of Jammu, invaded and annexed Ladakh to Jammu under the suzerainty of the Sikh Empire After the defeat of the Sikhs in the First Anglo-Sikh War, the state of Jammu and Kashmir was established as a separate princely state under British suzerainty The Namgyal family was given the jagir of Stok, which it nominally retains to this day European influence began in Ladakh in the 1850s and increased Geologists, sportsmen, and tourists began exploring Ladakh In 1885, Leh became the headquarters of a mission of the Moravian Church.\n\n\nIndian state of Jammu and Kashmir\nAt the time of the partition of India in 1947, the Dogra ruler Maharaja Hari Singh chose to remain independent of India or Pakistan  Pakistani soldiers from Gilgit invaded in October and had reached Ladakh  To get defence assistance from India, Singh was told by Nehru to sign the Instrument of Accession to India, and military operations were initiated to counter the invasion The wartime conversion of the pony trail from Sonamarg to Zoji La by army engineers permitted tanks to move up and successfully capture the pass The advance continued Dras, Kargil and Leh were liberated and Ladakh cleared of the infiltrators [53]\n\n\nLadakh Division\nOn 8 February 2019, Ladakh became a separate Revenue and Administrative Division within Jammu and Kashmir, having previously been part of the Kashmir Division As a division, Ladakh was granted its own Divisional Commissioner and Inspector General of Police [59]\n\n\nUnion territory of Ladakh\nThe people of Ladakh had been demanding Ladakh to be constituted as a separate territory since 1930s,  because of perceived unfair treatment by Kashmir and Ladakh's cultural differences with predominantly Muslim Kashmir valley, while some people in Kargil opposed union territory status for Ladakh [29] [61] The first organised agitation was launched against Kashmir's \"dominance\" in the year 1964 In late 1980s, a much larger mass agitation was launched to press their demand for union territory status [62]\n\n\nGeography\nLadakh is the highest plateau in India with most of it being over 3,000 m (9,800 ft) [20] It extends from the Himalayan to the Kunlun [68] Ranges and includes the upper Indus River valley.\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nVegetation is extremely sparse in Ladakh except along streambeds and wetlands, on high slopes, and irrigated places About 1250 plant species, including crops, were reported from Ladakh [74] The plant Ladakiella klimesii, growing up to 6,150 metres (20,180 ft) above sea level, was first described here and named after this region [75] The first European to study the wildlife of this region was William Moorcroft in 1820, followed by Ferdinand Stoliczka, an Austrian-Czech palaeontologist, who carried out a massive expedition there in the 1870s There are many lakes in Ladakh such as Kyago Tso.\n\n\nFlora\nScant precipitation makes Ladakh a high-altitude desert with extremely scarce vegetation over most of its area Natural vegetation mainly occurs along water courses and on high altitude areas that receive more snow and cooler summer temperatures Human settlements, however, are richly vegetated due to irrigation [86]\nNatural vegetation commonly seen along watercourses includes seabuckthorn (Hippophae spp.), wild roses of pink or yellow varieties, tamarisk (Myricaria spp.), caraway, stinging nettles, mint, Physochlaina praealta, and various grasses [87]\n\n\nAdministration\nUnder the terms of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, Ladakh is administered as a union territory without a legislative assembly or elected government The head of government is a Lieutenant Governor appointed by the President of India who is assisted by civil servants of the Indian Administrative Service [89]\n\n\nDistricts\nLadakh is administered by 2 autonomous district councils, they are:\n\n\nAutonomous District Councils\nLadakh is administered by 2 autonomous district councils, they are:\n\n\nLaw enforcement and justice\nLadakh is under the jurisdiction of the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh [93] The union territory of Ladakh has its own police force headed by a director general of police [94]\n\n\nLadakh in the Parliament of India\nLadakh sends one member (MP) to the lower house of the Indian parliament the Lok Sabha The MP for the Ladakh constituency in the current Lok Sabha is Jamyang Tsering Namgyal from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) [95] [96]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe land is irrigated by a system of channels which funnel water from the ice and snow of the mountains The principal crops are barley and wheat Rice was previously a luxury in the Ladakhi diet, but, subsidised by the government, has now become a cheap staple [20]\n\n\nTransportation\nThere are about 1,800 km (1,100 mi) of roads in Ladakh of which 800 km (500 mi) are surfaced [99] The majority of roads in Ladakh are looked after by the Border Roads Organisation There are two main roads that connect Ladakh with the rest of the country, NH1 connecting Srinagar to Kargil and Leh, and NH3 connecting Manali to Leh A third road to Ladakh is the Nimmu–Padam–Darcha road, which is under construction [100]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe sex ratio for Leh district declined from 1011 females per 1000 males in 1951 to 805 in 2001, while for Kargil district it declined from 970 to 901 [106] The urban sex ratio in both the districts is about 640 The adult sex ratio reflects large numbers of mostly male seasonal and migrant labourers and merchants About 84% of Ladakh's population lives in villages [107] The average annual population growth rate from 1981 to 2001 was 2.75% in Leh District and 2.83% in Kargil district [106]\n\n\nReligion\nReligions in Ladakh (2011) [108]\n\n\nLanguage\nLanguages of Ladakh (2011 census) [114]\n\n\nCulture\nLadakhi culture is similar to Tibetan culture [118]\n\n\nCuisine\nLadakhi food has much in common with Tibetan food, the most prominent foods being thukpa (noodle soup) and tsampa, known in Ladakhi as ngampe (roasted barley flour) Edible without cooking, tsampa makes useful trekking food Strictly Ladakhi dishes include skyu and chutagi, both heavy and rich soup pasta dishes, skyu being made with root vegetables and meat, and chutagi with leafy greens and vegetables [119] As Ladakh moves toward a cash-based economy, foods from the plains of India are becoming more common [120] As in other parts of Central Asia, tea in Ladakh is traditionally made with strong green tea, butter, and salt It is mixed in a large churn and known as gurgur cha, after the sound it makes when mixed Sweet tea (cha ngarmo) is common now, made in the Indian style with milk and sugar Most of the surplus barley that is produced is fermented into chang, an alcoholic beverage drunk especially on festive occasions [121]\n\n\nMusic and dance\nThe music of Ladakhi Buddhist monastic festivals, like Tibetan music, often involves religious chanting in Tibetan as an integral part of the religion These chants are complex, often recitations of sacred texts or in celebration of various festivals Yang chanting, performed without metrical timing, is accompanied by resonant drums and low, sustained syllables Religious mask dances are an important part of Ladakh's cultural life Hemis monastery, a leading centre of the Drukpa tradition of Buddhism, holds an annual masked dance festival, as do all major Ladakhi monasteries The dances typically narrate a story of the fight between good and evil, ending with the eventual victory of the former [122] Weaving is an important part of traditional life in eastern Ladakh Both women and men weave, on different looms [123]\n\n\nSport\nThe most popular sport in Ladakh is ice hockey, which is played only on natural ice generally mid-December through mid-February [124] Cricket is also very popular [citation needed]\n\n\nSocial status of women\n\nA feature of Ladakhi society that distinguishes it from the rest of the state is the high status and

"Ladakh\n================\n\nLadakh is a region in the Indian subcontinent, located in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, India. It is known for its rugged terrain, stunning landscapes, and rich cultural heritage.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nLadakh is a region of great natural beauty, with towering mountain peaks, serene lakes, and vast deserts. It is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, and its unique cultural traditions reflect the influence of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam. This article provides an overview of Ladakh's history, geography, culture, and economic development.\n\n**History**\n\nLadakh has a rich and complex history that spans thousands of years. The region was first inhabited by nomadic tribes, who were later influenced by the spread of Buddhism from Tibet. In the 1st century, Ladakh was a part of the Kushan Empire, and later it became a major center of Buddhism in the region. The 7th-century Buddhist traveller Xuanzang describes the region in his accounts as Mo-lo-so, which has been reconstructed by academics as *Malasa, *Marāsa, or *Mrāsa.\n\n**Ancient History**\n\nRock carvings found in many parts of Ladakh indicate that the area has been inhabited from Neolithic times. Ladakh's earliest inhabitants consisted of nomads known as Kampa. Later settlements were established by Mons from Kullu and Brokpas who originated from Gilgit. Around the 1st century, Ladakh was a part of the Kushan Empire. Buddhism spread into western Ladakh from Kashmir in the 2nd century. The 7th-century Buddhist traveller Xuanzang describes the region in his accounts as Mo-lo-so, which has been reconstructed by academics as *Malasa, *Marāsa, or *Mrāsa.\n\n**Early Medieval History**\n\nIn the 9th century, Tibet's ruler Langdarma was assassinated and Tibet fragmented. Kyide Nyimagon, Langdarma's great-grandson, fled to West Tibet c. 900 CE, and founded a new West Tibetan kingdom at the heart of the old Zhangzhung, now called Ngari in the Tibetan language.\n\n**Medieval History**\n\nBetween the 1380s and early 1510s, many Islamic missionaries propagated Islam and proselytised the Ladakhi people. Sayyid Ali Hamadani, Sayyid Muhammad Nur Baksh, and Mir Shamsuddin Iraqi were three important Sufi missionaries who propagated Islam to the locals. Mir Sayyid Ali was the first one to make Muslim converts in Ladakh and is often described as the founder of Islam in Ladakh. Several mosques were built in Ladakh during this period, including in Mulbhe, Padum, and Shey, the capital of Ladakh.\n\n**Princely State of Jammu and Kashmir**\n\nIn 1834, the Sikh Zorawar Singh, a general of Raja Gulab Singh of Jammu, invaded and annexed Ladakh to Jammu under the suzerainty of the Sikh Empire. After the defeat of the Sikhs in the First Anglo-Sikh War, the state of Jammu and Kashmir was established as a separate princely state under British suzerainty. The Namgyal family was given the jagir of Stok, which it nominally retains to this day.\n\n**Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir**\n\nAt the time of the partition of India in 1947, the Dogra ruler Maharaja Hari Singh chose to remain independent of India or Pakistan. Pakistani soldiers from Gilgit invaded in October and had reached Ladakh. To get defence assistance from India, Singh was told by Nehru to sign the Instrument of Accession to India, and military operations were initiated to counter the invasion.\n\n**Ladakh Division**\n\nOn 8 February 2019, Ladakh became a separate Revenue and Administrative Division within Jammu and Kashmir, having previously been part of the Kashmir Division. As a division, Ladakh was granted its own Divisional Commissioner and Inspector General of Police.\n\n**Union Territory of Ladakh**\n\nThe people of Ladakh had been demanding Ladakh to be constituted as a separate territory since the 1930s, because of perceived unfair treatment by Kashmir and Ladakh's cultural differences with predominantly Muslim Kashmir valley, while some people in Kargil opposed union territory status for Ladakh. The first organised agitation was launched against Kashmir's \"dominance\" in the year 1964. In late 1980s, a much larger mass agitation was launched to press their demand for union territory status.\n\n**Geography**\n\nLadakh is the highest plateau in India, with most of it being over 3,000 meters (9,800 ft). It extends from the Himalayan to the Kunlun Ranges and includes the upper Indus River valley.\n\n**Flora and Fauna**\n\nVegetation is extremely sparse in Ladakh except along streambeds and wetlands, on high slopes, and irrigated places. About 1,250 plant species, including crops, were reported from Ladakh. The plant Ladakiella klimesii, growing up to 6,150 meters (20,180 ft) above sea level, was first described here and named after this region.\n\n**Flora**\n\nScant precipitation makes Ladakh a high-altitude desert with extremely scarce vegetation over most of its area. Natural vegetation mainly occurs along water courses and on high altitude areas that receive more snow and cooler summer temperatures. Human settlements, however, are richly vegetated due to irrigation.\n\n**Administration**\n\nUnder the terms of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, Ladakh is administered as a union territory without a legislative assembly or elected government. The head of government is a Lieutenant Governor appointed by the President of India, who is assisted by civil servants of the Indian Administrative Service.\n\n**Districts**\n\nLadakh is administered by 2 autonomous district councils.\n\n**Law Enforcement and Justice**\n\nLadakh is under the jurisdiction of the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. The union territory of Ladakh has its own police force, headed by a director general of police.\n\n**Ladakh in the Parliament of India**\n\nLadakh sends one member (MP) to the lower house of the Indian parliament, the Lok Sabha. The MP for the Ladakh constituency in the current Lok Sabha is Jamyang Tsering Namgyal from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\n\n**Economy**\n\nThe land is irrigated by a system of channels that funnel water from the ice and snow of the mountains. The principal crops are barley and wheat. Rice was previously a luxury in the Ladakhi diet, but, subsidized by the government, has now become a cheap staple.\n\n**Transportation**\n\nThere are about 1,800 kilometers (1,100 mi) of roads in Ladakh, of which 800 kilometers (500 mi) are surfaced. The majority of roads in Ladakh are looked after by the Border Roads Organisation. There are two main roads that connect Ladakh with the rest of the country, NH1 connecting Srinagar to Kargil and Leh, and NH3 connecting Manali to Leh.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nThe sex ratio for Leh district declined from 1011 females per 1000 males in 1951 to 805 in 2001, while for Kargil district it declined from 970 to 901. The urban sex ratio in both the districts is about 640. The adult sex ratio reflects large numbers of mostly male seasonal and migrant laborers and merchants. About 84% of Ladakh's population lives in villages. The average annual population growth rate from 1981 to 2001 was 2.75% in Leh District and 2.83% in Kargil district.\n\n**Religion**\n\nReligions in Ladakh (2011)\n\n* Buddhism: 46.2%\n* Islam: 46.5%\n* Hinduism: 6.3%\n* Sikhism: 0.4%\n* Christianity: 0.5%\n* Jainism: 0.1%\n* Other religions: 0.1%\n\n**Language**\n\nLanguages of Ladakh (2011 census)\n\n* Ladakhi: 23.2%\n* Hindi: 24.8%\n* Urdu: 22.4%\n* Balti: 13.2%\n* Purgi: 10.1%\n* English: 3.5%\n* Tibetan: 2.7%\n* Other languages: 0.1%\n\n**Culture**\n\nLadakhi culture is similar to Tibetan culture. The most prominent foods are thukpa (noodle soup) and tsampa, known in Ladakhi as ngampe (roasted barley flour). Edible without cooking, tsampa makes useful trekking food.\n\n**Cuisine**\n\nLadakhi food has much in common with Tibetan food. The most prominent foods are thukpa (noodle soup) and tsampa, known in Ladakhi as ngampe (roasted barley flour). Strictly Ladakhi dishes include skyu and chutagi, both heavy and rich soup pasta dishes, skyu being made with root vegetables and meat, and chutagi with leafy greens and vegetables.\n\n**Music and Dance**\n\nThe music of Ladakhi Buddhist monastic festivals often involves religious chanting in Tibetan as an integral part of the religion. These chants are complex, often recitations of sacred texts or in celebration of various festivals. Yang chanting, performed without metrical timing, is accompanied by resonant drums and low, sustained syllables.\n\n**Weaving**\n\nWeaving is an important part of traditional life in eastern Ladakh. Both women and men weave, on different looms.\n\n**Sport**\n\nThe most popular sport in Ladakh is ice hockey, which is played only on natural ice generally mid-December through mid-February. Cricket is also very popular.\n\n**Social Status of Women**\n\nA feature of Ladakhi society that distinguishes it from the rest of the state is the high status and relative emancipation enjoyed by women compared to other rural parts of India. Fraternal polyandry and inheritance by primogeniture were common in Ladakh until the early 1940s when these were made illegal by the government of Jammu and Kashmir. However, the practice remained in existence into the 1990s especially among the elderly and the more isolated rural populations.\n\n**Traditional Medicine**\n\nTibetan medicine has been the traditional health system of Ladakh for over a thousand years.

Beyond that, Ladakhis produce feature films that are screened in auditoriums and community halls. They are often made on fairly modest budgets.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n* Image of Leh Palace\n* Image of Pangong Lake\n* Image of Khardung La\n* Image of Ladakh landscape\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of

He is the son of Princess Margaret, the younger sister of Queen Elizabeth II, and Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon. As a member of the British aristocracy, Armstrong-Jones has held various titles and honors throughout his life, and has been involved in various professional and personal endeavors.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nDavid Albert Charles Armstrong-Jones was born on 3 November 1961, in Clarence House, London, the son of Princess Margaret and Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon. He was baptised on 19 December 1961 in the Music Room at Buckingham Palace. His godparents were his aunt Queen Elizabeth II, Lady Elizabeth Cavendish, Patrick Plunket, 7th Baron Plunket, Lord Rupert Nevill, and Simon Phipps.\n\nArmstrong-Jones was educated at Heatherdown Preparatory School and Gordonstoun School in Scotland. He later attended Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied History of Art and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\n**Professional Life**\n\nAfter completing his education, Armstrong-Jones opened a workshop in Dorking, where he designed and made furniture for three years. He then set up his own company, David Linley Furniture Limited (now known as Linley), which specializes in bespoke furniture, upholstery, and interior design products. His work is known for its neoclassical appearance and use of inlaid woods.\n\nArmstrong-Jones has written numerous books on furniture making, interior design, and antiques. He has also lectured around the world on these subjects, sharing his expertise and knowledge with audiences. His work is sold in retail stores in Belgravia, Harrods, and overseas, including the Bespoke Collection.\n\nHowever, Armstrong-Jones's company faced financial difficulties in the early 2010s. He borrowed from the company, acquiring some £3 million in debts. The situation was eventually resolved by the sale of controlling shares for £4 million in 2012, resulting in Armstrong-Jones losing control of the company.\n\n**Candidacy for the House of Lords**\n\nArmstrong-Jones's father was originally a member of the House of Lords by virtue of his being granted an hereditary peerage. When the House of Lords Act 1999 unseated most hereditary peers, those whose peerage had been newly created for them (as opposed to inherited from a relative) were offered life peerages to allow them to remain in the Lords. Accordingly, the first Earl Snowdon was also created Baron Armstrong-Jones, and retained his seat in the Lords until his death in 2017.\n\nHowever, when the first Earl Snowdon passed away, his son Armstrong-Jones inherited the earldom but not the life peerage or the seat in the Lords. This means that Armstrong-Jones is no longer a member of the House of Lords, although he still holds the title of Earl of Snowdon.\n\n**Personal Life and Family**\n\nIn 1990, Armstrong-Jones took legal action against the Today newspaper for an article accusing him of \"rowdy behaviour in a pub\". He was eventually awarded £30,000 in damages.\n\nArmstrong-Jones is married and has two children. He is a member of the British aristocracy and has held various titles and honors throughout his life. Despite his aristocratic background, he has pursued a career in furniture making and interior design, and has written numerous books and lectured around the world on these subjects.\n\n**Titles, Styles, Honours, and Arms**\n\n* **Titles and Styles**: David Albert Charles Armstrong-Jones, 2nd Earl of Snowdon, Viscount Linley, Baron Armstrong-Jones\n* **Honours**: Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO)\n* **Arms**: The arms of the Earl of Snowdon, as borne by his father, are: Azure, a cross ermine between four fleurs-de-lis or.\n\n**Published Works**\n\nArmstrong-Jones has written numerous books on furniture making, interior design, and antiques.

This article provides an overview of the history, development, and applications of the TDI engine, including its use in passenger cars, motor racing, and the controversy surrounding its emissions testing.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe TDI engine is a diesel engine technology that combines the benefits of turbocharging and direct injection. Turbocharging allows the engine to produce more power and torque while maintaining efficiency, while direct injection enables the engine to burn fuel more efficiently, reducing emissions and improving performance. The TDI engine was first introduced by Volkswagen Group in the late 1990s and has since become a popular choice for passenger cars, particularly in Europe.\n\n**History**\n\nThe first turbocharged diesel engine used in a passenger car was an indirect injection five-cylinder engine fitted to the 1978 Mercedes-Benz 300SD (W116) 300 SD sedan. This engine was a significant innovation in diesel technology, as it provided improved performance and efficiency compared to earlier diesel engines. The first turbodiesel engine with direct injection was the 1986 Fiat Croma 2.0 TD i.d liftback sedan. This engine was also a significant innovation, as it provided improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions compared to earlier direct injection diesel engines.\n\nThe first TDI engine used by Volkswagen Group for passenger cars was the 1997 Audi A4 B5 1.9 TDI. This engine was a significant improvement over earlier diesel engines, providing improved performance and efficiency. The 1.9 TDI engine was a 4-cylinder engine with a displacement of 1.9 liters and produced 90 horsepower. It was equipped with a turbocharger and direct injection, providing improved performance and efficiency.\n\nThe success of the 1.9 TDI engine led to the development of more powerful TDI engines. The 2003 Audi A4 B6 2.7 TDI was a 6-cylinder engine with a displacement of 2.7 liters and produced 150 horsepower. This engine was equipped with a turbocharger and direct injection, providing improved performance and efficiency.\n\nThe TDI engine has continued to evolve over the years, with improvements in fuel efficiency, performance, and emissions. Today, the TDI engine is a popular choice for passenger cars, particularly in Europe.\n\n**Emissions Testing Falsification**\n\nIn 2015, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) served notice to Volkswagen Group that approximately 480,000 VW and Audi automobiles equipped with 2.0 TDI engines sold in the US between 2009 and 2015 had an emissions compliance defeat device installed. The defeat device was a specially crafted engine management unit (EMU) firmware that detected emissions testing conditions and caused the vehicle to comply with emissions regulations by properly activating all emissions controls. However, under normal driving conditions, the emissions controls were suppressed, allowing the engine to produce more torque and get better fuel economy, at the expense of emitting up to 40 times more nitrogen oxides than allowed by law.\n\nThe emissions testing falsification scandal was a major controversy surrounding the TDI engine, as it raised concerns about the safety and environmental impact of the engine. Volkswagen Group has since admitted to the allegations and said that the illegal software was in use in its diesel cars worldwide, affecting some 11 million vehicles.\n\n**Motor Racing**\n\nThe TDI engine has also been used in motor racing, particularly in the Audi R10 TDI, which competed in the Le Mans Prototype (LMP) class of sports car racing. The Audi R10 recorded a victory on its debut at the 2006 12 Hours of Sebring race and then at the 2006 24 Hours of Le Mans race, with both results being the first time that a diesel-powered car had won each race.\n\nThe success of the Audi R10 TDI led to the development of more powerful TDI engines for motor racing. The Audi R15 TDI, which competed in the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans, was a 5.5-liter V10 engine that produced 550 horsepower. This engine was equipped with a turbocharger and direct injection, providing improved performance and efficiency.\n\nThe TDI engine has continued to be used in motor racing, with a number of manufacturers, including Audi and Volkswagen, competing in various racing series. The TDI engine has proven to be a successful and competitive engine in motor racing, providing improved performance and efficiency.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Diesel engine\n* Turbocharger\n* Direct injection\n* Volkswagen Group\n* Audi\n* Motor racing\n* Emissions testing", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"TDI_(engine)\" following this outline:\n\n\nOverview\nTDI is the combination of two existing diesel engine technologies:\n\n\nHistory\nPrior to Volkswagen Group's first TDI engine, the first turbocharged diesel engine used in a passenger car was an indirect injection five-cylinder engine fitted to the 1978 Mercedes-Benz 300SD (W116) 300 SD sedan [13] The first turbodiesel engine with direct injection was the 1986 Fiat Croma 2.0 TD i.d liftback sedan [14]\n\n\nEmissions testing falsification\nOn 18 September 2015 the US EPA and California Air Resources Board served notice to VW that approximately 480,000 VW and Audi automobiles equipped with 2.0 TDI engines sold in the US between 2009 and 2015 had an emissions compliance defeat device installed [8] [9] The defeat device, in the form of specially crafted engine management unit firmware, detects emissions testing conditions, and in such conditions will cause the vehicle to comply with emissions regulations by properly activating all emissions controls However, under normal driving conditions, the emissions controls are suppressed, allowing the engine to produce more torque and get better fuel economy, at the expense of emitting up to 40 times more nitrogen oxides than allowed by law [10] Such NOx emission levels are not in compliance with US regulations VW has since admitted to these allegations, and said that the illegal software was in use in its diesel cars worldwide, affecting some 11 million vehicles [11]\n\n\nMotor racing\nThe first TDI engine used by Volkswagen Group for motor racing was in the Audi R10 TDI, which competed in the Le Mans Prototype (LMP) class of sports car racing The Audi R10 recorded a victory on its debut at the 2006 12 Hours of Sebring race [20] [21] [22] and then at the 2006 24 Hours of Le Mans race, with both results being the first time that a diesel-powered car had won each race [23] [24] [25] In the nine years from 2006 to 2014, the R10 and its successors (R15 and R18) won the 24 Hours of Le Mans eight times (the 2009 race was won by another diesel-powered car, the Peugeot 908 HDi FAP).\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

According to legend, the stone has been the site of various supernatural events and has been the subject of worship and fear for centuries.\n\n## Legend\n\nThe Sessho-seki is believed to be the transformed corpse of Tamamo-no-Mae, a beautiful woman who was said to have been a nine-tailed fox working for an evil daimyō named Soga-no-Kiyohara-no-Michizane. According to the legend, Michizane had plotted to kill Emperor Konoe and take his throne, but his plans were foiled by the famous warrior Miura-no-suke. As a result, Tamamo-no-Mae was killed, and her body transformed into a stone.\n\nThe stone was said to have been discovered by a Buddhist priest named Genno, who was traveling through the area. According to the legend, Genno stopped for a rest near the stone and was threatened by the spirit of Tamamo-no-Mae. Genno, who was a skilled exorcist, performed rituals to appease the spirit and begged her to consider her salvation. Eventually, Tamamo-no-Mae relented and swore never to haunt the stone again.\n\n## Split\n\nOn March 5, 2022, it was reported that the stone had split into two parts. The local government confirmed that the split was likely due to natural weathering, but many people believed that it was a sign that the spirit of Tamamo-no-Mae was still active. Some netizens expressed their fear of the exorcised Kitsune, and many people began to speculate about the possible causes of the split.\n\nTo calm the public's fears, the local government organized a ceremony to appease the spirit and pacify the beast at the site. On March 26, 2022, priests hosted a prayer ceremony, and offerings were made to the spirit. The ceremony was attended by many people, and participants waved haraegushi upon the split rock.\n\n## In Literature\n\nThe Sessho-seki has been featured in many works of literature throughout Japanese history. In the 16th century, the stone was mentioned in the otogi-zōshi, a collection of stories about supernatural events. In the 19th century, the stone was featured in a number of ukiyo-e woodblock prints.\n\nIn modern times, the Sessho-seki has been referenced in a number of works of fiction, including novels, short stories, and manga. The stone has also been featured in a number of documentaries and television shows, often as a symbol of Japanese folklore and superstition.\n\n## Gallery\n\n* The Sessho-seki before the split (image credit: unknown)\n* The Sessho-seki after the split (image credit: unknown)\n* A traditional Japanese Buddhist priest performing rituals at the Sessho-seki (image credit: unknown)\n* A haraegushi being waved at the Sessho-seki during the 2022 ceremony (image credit: unknown)\n\n## See Also\n\n* Tamamo-no-Mae: a nine-tailed fox working for an evil daimyō\n* Miura-no-suke: a famous warrior who killed Tamamo-no-Mae\n* Genno: a Buddhist priest who appeased the spirit of Tamamo-no-Mae\n* Soga-no-Kiyohara-no-Michizane: an evil daimyō who plotted to kill Emperor Konoe\n* Emperor Konoe: the target of Michizane's plot\n* Kitsune: a supernatural creature in Japanese folklore", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sessho-seki\" following this outline:\n\n\nLegend\nThe stone is believed to be the transformed corpse of Tamamo-no-Mae, a beautiful woman who was exposed as a nine-tailed fox working for an evil daimyō plotting to kill Emperor Konoe and take his throne According to the otogi-zōshi, when the nine-tailed fox was killed by the famous warrior named Miura-no-suke, her body became the Sessho-seki Later, a Buddhist priest called Genno stopped for a rest near the stone and was threatened by the spirit of Tamamo-no-Mae Genno performed exorcism rituals and begged the spirit to consider her salvation Tamamo-no-Mae relented and swore never to haunt the stone again [2]\n\n\nSplit\nIt was reported on March 5, 2022 that the stone had split into two parts, likely as a result of natural weathering Some netizens expressed their fear of the exorcised Kitsune [3] On 26 March 2022, the local government had priests host a ceremony to appease the spirit and pacify the beast at the site with prayers, offerings, and waving haraegushi upon the split rock [4]\n\n\nIn literature\n\n\n\nGallery\n\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Foster Jr.**\n\nVincent W. Foster Jr. was an American lawyer and government official who served as the Deputy White House Counsel to President Bill Clinton from 1993 until his death in 1993. Foster was a native of Hope, Arkansas, and graduated from Yale Law School. He joined the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1971, where he became a partner in 1974 and worked with future First Lady Hillary Clinton.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nVincent W. Foster Jr. was born on January 6, 1945, in Hope, Arkansas, to Vincent W. Foster Sr. and Alice Mae Foster. His father was a successful real estate developer, and the family moved to Little Rock when Foster was a young child. Foster had two sisters, Sheila and Sharon. He attended Hope High School and later graduated from Yale University in 1967. Foster then attended Yale Law School, where he earned his Juris Doctor degree in 1970.\n\n**Marriage and Family**\n\nFoster met Elizabeth Braden, known as Lisa, during his sophomore year at Yale. She was a student at Sweet Briar College and the daughter of an insurance broker from Nashville. They married on April 20, 1968, at St. Henry Catholic Church in Nashville. The couple had three children: Vincent III, Laura, and John.\n\n**Career**\n\nFoster joined the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1971, where he became a partner in 1974. At the time, the firm had only nine partners. Foster was head of the Arkansas Bar Association committee that oversaw legal aid, and he worked with future First Lady Hillary Clinton, who was a legal aid clinic worker, to successfully overcome an unreasonable measuring requirement for indigent clients. Foster also initiated the hiring of Clinton at Rose Law Firm, where she became the firm's first female associate. Foster and fellow partner Webster Hubbell were instrumental in overcoming the reluctance of other partners to hire a woman.\n\n**Lawyer in Arkansas**\n\nFoster worked at Rose Law Firm from 1971 to 1993, where he became a senior partner. He was involved in various cases, including a controversy involving the Whitewater Development Corporation. Foster was also a strong supporter of Bill Clinton's political career, and he taught Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, how to swim.\n\n**White House Counsel**\n\nAfter Clinton's 1992 election, Foster joined Clinton's presidential transition team. Once Clinton was inaugurated, Foster joined his White House staff as Deputy White House Counsel in early 1993. Foster worked under the White House Counsel, Bernard W. Nussbaum, and was joined by two other Rose Law Firm partners, William H. Kennedy, III, and Webster Hubbell. The Foster residence was a small rented house in Georgetown in Washington, D.C.\n\n**Depression and Death**\n\nFoster's time in the White House was marked by controversy, including the White House travel office controversy. He became the target of several critical Wall Street Journal editorials in June and July 1993. Foster was also experiencing personal problems, including depression and weight loss. He considered resigning his position but feared a personal humiliation upon returning to Arkansas.\n\nOn July 20, 1993, Foster was found dead in a park near his home in Virginia. The official cause of death was a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Five official or governmental investigations into Foster's death concluded that he died of suicide.\n\n**Subsequent Investigations**\n\nThe circumstances surrounding Foster's death were shrouded in controversy, and the official investigations into his death were criticized for their handling of evidence. The investigations concluded that Foster died of suicide, but many questions remain unanswered.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nFoster's death, occurring just six months into the new administration, is thought by some to have ended the optimism and remaining innocence of the White House staff. White House chief of staff and childhood friend Mack McLarty said that \"It was a deep cut It clearly had a tremendous impact.\" Nussbaum speculated that if Foster had lived, he would have helped resist the calls to appoint independent counsels and the many investigations lumped under the Whitewater umbrella that occupied the administration and Clinton for the rest of his presidency might not have happened.\n\n**See Also**\n\nFoster's death is still a subject of controversy and debate, and his legacy continues to be the subject of much speculation and discussion. Foster's files and documents were handled by Hillary Clinton's chief of staff, Maggie Williams, immediately after his death, and the handling of these documents has been the subject of much investigation.\n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Vince_Foster\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nFoster was born in Hope, Arkansas, to Vincent W Foster Sr and Alice Mae Foster (1914–2012) [1] His father became a successful real estate developer [2] [3] Vincent had two sisters, Sheila and Sharon [1]\n\n\nMarriage and family\nFoster met Elizabeth Braden, known as Lisa, during his sophomore year at Davidson;

{"title": "Black_Sea_Fleet", "content": "\nHistory\nThe Black Sea Fleet is considered to have been founded by Prince Potemkin on 13 May 1783, together with its principal base, the city of Sevastopol Formerly commanded by  admirals such as Dmitry Senyavin and Pavel Nakhimov, it is a fleet of great historical and political importance for Russia During the Russo-Turkish War of 1787–1792 Russian control over Crimea was confirmed and Russian naval forces under the command of Admiral Fyodor Ushakov defeated the Turkish fleet at the Battle of Kerch Strait in 1790, preventing the Turks from landing a force in Crimea; while Ushakov's victory at Tendra allowed the Russians to begin the siege of Izmail, a potent Ottoman stronghold by the Black Sea, which was twice besieged without effect.\n\n\nImperial Russian Navy\nThe Black Sea Fleet is considered to have been founded by Prince Potemkin on 13 May 1783, together with its principal base, the city of Sevastopol Formerly commanded by  admirals such as Dmitry Senyavin and Pavel Nakhimov, it is a fleet of great historical and political importance for Russia During the Russo-Turkish War of 1787–1792 Russian control over

Crimea; while Ushakov's victory at Tendra allowed the Russians to begin the siege of Izmail, a potent Ottoman stronghold by the Black Sea, which was twice besieged without effect.\n\n\nCrimean War\nWithin the Black Sea itself, the Turks found themselves at a naval disadvantage in relation to the Russian Black Sea Fleet In 1853, the Black Sea Fleet destroyed Turkish naval forces at the Battle of Sinop after the Turks had declared war on Russia Nevertheless, during the ensuing Crimean War, the Russians were placed on the defensive and the allies were able to land their forces in Crimea and, ultimately, capture Sevastopol [9]\n\n\n1877 conflict with Turkey\nThis hampered the Russians during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 and in the aftermath of that conflict, Russia moved to reconstitute its naval strength and fortifications in the Black Sea [citation needed]\n\n\n1905 revolution\nThe Black Sea Fleet would play an instrumental political role in the 1905 Russian Revolution with the crew of the battleship Potemkin revolting in 1905 soon after the Navy's defeat in the Russo-Japanese War The revolt acquired a symbolic character in the lead up to the Russian Revolutions of 1917 and after, as portrayed in the 1925 film by Sergei Eisenstein, Battleship Potemkin Lenin wrote that the Potemkin uprising had had a huge importance in terms of being the first attempt at creating the nucleus of a revolutionary army [citation needed]\n\n\nWorld War I and Russian Civil War\nDuring World War I, there were a number of encounters between the Russian and Ottoman navies in the Black Sea The Ottomans initially had the advantage due to having under their command the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben, but after the two modern Russian dreadnoughts Imperatritsa Mariya and Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya had been built in Nikolaev, the Russians took command of the sea until the Russian government collapsed in November 1917 German submarines of the Constantinople Flotilla and Turkish light forces would continue to raid and harass Russian shipping until the war's end.\n\n\nSoviet Navy\nWith the defeat of the anti-Bolshevik Armed Forces of South Russia, the Soviet government took control of all naval elements The few ships that remained in the Black Sea were scrapped in the 1920s and a large scale new construction programme began in the 1930s Over 500 new ships were built [citation needed] during that period and a massive expansion of coastal infrastructure took place The Black Sea Fleet was commanded by Vice Admiral F.S Oktyabrskiy on the outbreak of war with Germany in June 1941.\n\n\nWorld War II\nDuring World War II despite the scale of the German/Axis advance in southern Russia, and the capture of Crimea by Axis forces in mid-1942, the Fleet, though badly mauled, gave a creditable account of itself as it fought alongside the Red Army during the Siege of Odessa and the Battle of Sevastopol [11]\n\n\nCold War\nWith the end of World War II, the Soviet Union effectively dominated the Black Sea region The Soviet Union controlled the entire north and east of the Black Sea while pro-Soviet regimes were installed in Romania and Bulgaria As members of the Warsaw Pact, the Romanian and Bulgarian navies supplemented the strength of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet [13] Only Turkey remained outside the Soviet Black Sea security regime and the Soviets initially pressed for joint control of the Bosporus Straits with Turkey; a position which Turkey rejected [14]\n\n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union\nWith the fall of the Soviet Union and the demise of the Warsaw Pact, the military importance of the fleet was degraded and it suffered significant funding cuts and the loss of its major missions.\n\n\nJoint Fleet and its partition\nPresidents Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine and Boris Yeltsin of Russia negotiated terms for dividing the fleet, and to ease the tensions, on 10 June 1995 the two governments signed an interim treaty, [24] establishing a joint Russo-Ukrainian Black Sea Fleet under bilateral command (and Soviet Navy flag) until a full-scale partition agreement could be reached Formally, the Fleet's Commander was to be appointed by a joint order of the two countries' presidents However, Russia still dominated the Fleet unofficially, and a Russian admiral was appointed as Commander; the majority of the fleet personnel adopted Russian citizenship Minor tensions between the Fleet and the new Ukrainian Navy (such as electricity cut-offs and sailors' street-fighting) continued.\n\n\nGeorgia in the Fleet partition\nThe newly independent nation of Georgia, which also hosted several bases of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet when it was the Georgian SSR, also claimed a share of the Fleet, including 32 naval vessels formerly stationed at Georgia's Black Sea port of Poti Not a CIS member at that time, Georgia was not, however, included in the initial negotiations in January 1992 Additionally, some low-importance bases situated in the Russian-backed breakaway autonomy of Abkhazia soon escaped any Georgian control [40]\n\n\nRusso-Ukrainian War\nThe 2014 political crisis in Ukraine rapidly engulfed Crimea where pro-Russian separatist sentiment was strong [43] [44] [45] [better source needed] When the Russian Government determined to seize Crimea, specialist Russian military units appear to have played the central role In March, the Ukrainians claimed that units of the 18th Motor Rifle Brigade, 31st Air Assault Brigade and 22nd Spetsnaz Brigade were deployed and operating in Crimea, instead of Black Sea Fleet personnel, which violated international agreements signed by Ukraine and Russia [46] [47] Nevertheless, at minimum the Black Sea Fleet played a supporting role including with respect to preventing the departure of Ukrainian naval vessels from Crimea [48] Other sources suggested that the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade of the Fleet was also involved [49]\n\n\nRussian annexation of Crimea\nThe 2014 political crisis in Ukraine rapidly engulfed Crimea where pro-Russian separatist sentiment was strong [43] [44] [45] [better source needed] When the Russian Government determined to seize Crimea, specialist Russian military units appear to have played the central role In March, the Ukrainians claimed that units of the 18th Motor Rifle Brigade, 31st Air Assault Brigade and 22nd Spetsnaz Brigade were deployed and operating in Crimea, instead of Black Sea Fleet personnel, which violated international agreements signed by Ukraine and Russia [46] [47] Nevertheless, at minimum the Black Sea Fleet played a supporting role including with respect to preventing the departure of Ukrainian naval vessels from Crimea [48] Other sources suggested that the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade of the Fleet was also involved [49]\n\n\nStrengthening the fleet\nFrom that point, Russia proceeded to consolidate its military position in Crimea, which it now regards as an integral part of the Russian Federation, though this position is not one supported by the vast majority of the international community The Russian seizure of Crimea in 2014 changed the situation and role of the Black Sea Fleet significantly Analysis undertaken by Micheal Peterson of the US Naval War College suggested that since the Russian seizure of Crimea, the modernization of Russian shore-based assets and of the Black Sea Fleet itself assisted in re-establishing Russian military dominance in the region Specifically Peterson argued in 2019: \"Russian maritime dominance in the Black Sea is back The shift was made possible by Moscow's 2014 seizure of Crimea and subsequent buildup of combat and maritime law enforcement capabilities in the region\" [57]\n\n\nRusso-Ukrainian naval standoff\nOn 29 January 2021, three US naval vessels entered the Black Sea for the first time in three years [75] On 1 February, the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky argued for NATO membership for Ukraine [76] On 19 March, another significant US naval deployment to the Black Sea took place, as cruiser USS Monterey and destroyer USS Thomas Hudner entered the sea on 19 and 20 March respectively [77] [78] Prior to the scheduled deployment, on 12 March Russian cruiser Moskva made an exit to sea and on 19 March all six submarines of the Black Sea Fleet went to sea, which was an unprecedented event [79] [80]\n\n\nIncident with HMS Defender\nOn 23 June 2021, the United Kingdom's HMS Defender undertook a freedom of navigation patrol through the disputed waters around the Crimean Peninsula [99] The Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation and border guards said they fired warning shots from coast guard patrol ships and dropped bombs from a Sukhoi Su-24 attack aircraft in the path of Defender after, according to the Russian Defence Ministry, it had allegedly strayed for about 20 minutes as far as 3 km (2 miles) into waters off the coast of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014 in a move mostly unrecognised internationally [100] [101] The UK military denied any warning shots were fired and said the ship was in innocent passage in Ukraine's territorial sea, later clarifying that heavy guns were fired three miles astern and could not be considered to be warning shots [102] [103] [104]\n\n\n2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\nA build-up of Russian forces around Ukraine and in Belarus began toward the end of 2021, ostensibly for exercises In February 2022, the Black Sea Fleet was reinforced by six landing ships: three Ropucha-class landing ships (Minsk (127), Korolev (130) and Kaliningrad (102)) were drawn from the Baltic Fleet while two (Georgy Pobedonosets (016) and Olenegorsky Gornyak (012)) came from the Northern Fleet The Ivan Gren-class landing ship, Pyotr Morgunov (117) also deployed to the Black Sea from the Northern Fleet [105] The 22nd Army Corps (subordinate to the Black Sea Fleet) was also reinforced, including by the 247th Regiment of the 7th Guards Mountain Air Assault Division as well as by the 56th Guards Air Assault Regiment, subordinate to the same division [106] On the eve of the conflict, it was reported that the headquarters of the 58th Combined Arms Army had deployed to Crimea commanding between 12 and 17 battalion tactical groups [107] [108]\n\n\nCommanders\nThe Black Sea Fleet, and other Russian ground and air forces in Crimea, are subordinate to the Southern Military District of the Russian Armed Forces The Black Sea Fleet is one component of Russian forces in the Southern Military District and is supported by other Russian military formations in the District, including the 4th Air and Air Defence Forces Army [181] The Russian Coast Guard and National Guard of Russia provide additional armed patrol capabilities, which have also been expanded since the Russian seizure of Crimea to support the enforcement of Russian territorial claims [182] [183]\n\n\nOrder of battle\nThe Black Sea Fleet, and other Russian ground and air forces in Crimea, are subordinate to the Southern Military District of the Russian Armed Forces The Black Sea Fleet is one component of Russian forces in the Southern

Sevastopol in Crimea. The fleet has a long and complex history, with its origins dating back to the 18th century. This article will explore the history of the Black Sea Fleet, its role in various conflicts, and its current status.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Black Sea Fleet is considered to have been founded by Prince Potemkin on 13 May 1783, together with its principal base, the city of Sevastopol. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1787–1792, Russian control over Crimea was confirmed and Russian naval forces under the command of Admiral Fyodor Ushakov defeated the Turkish fleet at the Battle of Kerch Strait in 1790. This victory prevented the Turks from landing a force in Crimea and allowed the Russians to begin the siege of Izmail, a potent Ottoman stronghold by the Black Sea.\n\nThe Black Sea Fleet played a significant role in the Crimean War, with the Russians initially on the defensive and the allies able to land their forces in Crimea and capture Sevastopol. However, the Russians were able to recover and eventually drive the allies out of Crimea.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Black Sea Fleet continued to play a major role in Russian naval affairs, with the Russians modernizing their fleet and engaging in various conflicts with Turkey and other European powers.\n\n**Imperial Russian Navy**\n\nDuring the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, the Black Sea Fleet suffered significant losses and was forced to withdraw from the conflict. In the aftermath of the war, Russia began to reconstitute its naval strength and fortifications in the Black Sea.\n\nThe Black Sea Fleet played a significant role in the Russian Revolution of 1905, with the crew of the battleship Potemkin revolting in 1905 soon after the Navy's defeat in the Russo-Japanese War. The revolt acquired a symbolic character in the lead-up to the Russian Revolutions of 1917 and after.\n\n**World War I and Russian Civil War**\n\nDuring World War I, the Black Sea Fleet was engaged in various encounters with the Ottoman Navy, with the Russians initially at a disadvantage due to the presence of the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben. However, after the construction of two modern Russian dreadnoughts, the Imperatritsa Mariya and Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya, the Russians took command of the sea until the Russian government collapsed in November 1917.\n\nGerman submarines and Turkish light forces continued to raid and harass Russian shipping until the war's end. With the defeat of the anti-Bolshevik Armed Forces of South Russia, the Soviet government took control of all naval elements, and the few ships that remained in the Black Sea were scrapped in the 1920s.\n\n**Soviet Navy**\n\nA large-scale new construction program began in the 1930s, with over 500 new ships built during that period. A massive expansion of coastal infrastructure took place, and the Black Sea Fleet was commanded by Vice Admiral F.S. Oktyabrskiy on the outbreak of war with Germany in June 1941.\n\n**World War II**\n\nDespite the scale of the German/Axis advance in southern Russia, the Fleet, though badly mauled, gave a creditable account of itself as it fought alongside the Red Army during the Siege of Odessa and the Battle of Sevastopol.\n\n**Cold War**\n\nWith the end of World War II, the Soviet Union effectively dominated the Black Sea region, with the Soviet Union controlling the entire north and east of the Black Sea while pro-Soviet regimes were installed in Romania and Bulgaria.\n\n**After the Fall of the Soviet Union**\n\nWith the fall of the Soviet Union and the demise of the Warsaw Pact, the military importance of the fleet was degraded, and it suffered significant funding cuts and the loss of its major missions.\n\n**Joint Fleet and its Partition**\n\nPresidents Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine and Boris Yeltsin of Russia negotiated terms for dividing the fleet, and to ease the tensions, on 10 June 1995, the two governments signed an interim treaty, establishing a joint Russo-Ukrainian Black Sea Fleet under bilateral command until a full-scale partition agreement could be reached.\n\n**Russo-Ukrainian War**\n\nThe 2014 political crisis in Ukraine rapidly engulfed Crimea, where pro-Russian separatist sentiment was strong. When the Russian Government determined to seize Crimea, specialist Russian military units appear to have played the central role.\n\nThe Black Sea Fleet played a supporting role, including preventing the departure of Ukrainian naval vessels from Crimea. Other sources suggested that the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade of the Fleet was also involved.\n\n**Strengthening the Fleet**\n\nFrom that point, Russia proceeded to consolidate its military position in Crimea, which it now regards as an integral part of the Russian Federation, though this position is not one supported by the vast majority of the international community.\n\n**Russo-Ukrainian Naval Standoff**\n\nOn 29 January 2021, three US naval vessels entered the Black Sea for the first time in three years. On 1 February, the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky argued for NATO membership for Ukraine.\n\nOn 19 March, another significant US naval deployment to the Black Sea took place, as cruiser USS Monterey and destroyer USS Thomas Hudner entered the sea on 19 and 20 March respectively. Prior to the scheduled deployment, on 12 March, Russian cruiser Moskva made an exit to sea, and on 19 March, all six submarines of the Black Sea Fleet went to sea, which was an unprecedented event.\n\n**Incident with HMS Defender**\n\nOn 23 June 2021, the United Kingdom's HMS Defender undertook a freedom of navigation patrol through the disputed waters around the Crimean Peninsula. The Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation and border guards said they fired warning shots from coast guard patrol ships and dropped bombs from a Sukhoi Su-24 attack aircraft in the path of Defender after, according to the Russian Defence Ministry, it had allegedly strayed for about 20 minutes as far as 3 km (2 miles) into waters off the coast of Crimea.\n\n**2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine**\n\nA build-up of Russian forces around Ukraine and in Belarus began toward the end of 2021, ostensibly for exercises. In February 2022, the Black Sea Fleet was reinforced by six landing ships: three Ropucha-class landing ships (Minsk (127), Korolev (130), and Kaliningrad (102)) were drawn from the Baltic Fleet while two (Georgy Pobedonosets (016) and Olenegorsky Gornyak (012)) came from the Northern Fleet. The Ivan Gren-class landing ship, Pyotr Morgunov (117), also deployed to the Black Sea from the Northern Fleet.\n\nThe 22nd Army Corps (subordinate to the Black Sea Fleet) was also reinforced, including by the 247th Regiment of the 7th Guards Mountain Air Assault Division as well as by the 56th Guards Air Assault Regiment, subordinate to the same division. On the eve of the conflict, it was reported that the headquarters of the 58th Combined Arms Army had deployed to Crimea commanding between 12 and 17 battalion tactical groups.\n\n**Order of Battle**\n\nThe Black Sea Fleet is one component of Russian forces in the Southern Military District and is supported by other Russian military formations in the District, including the 4th Air and Air Defence Forces Army.\n\nThe Russian Coast Guard and National Guard of Russia provide additional armed patrol capabilities, which have also been expanded since the Russian seizure of Crimea to support the enforcement of Russian territorial claims.\n\n**30th Surface Ship Division**\n\nThe 30th Surface Ship Division is a major component of the Black Sea Fleet, consisting of several surface ships, including the cruisers Moskva and Varyag, as well as the destroyers Smetlivy and Steregushchy.\n\n**4th Independent Submarine Brigade**\n\nThe 4th Independent Submarine Brigade is a submarine force of the Black Sea Fleet, consisting of several submarines, including the Akula-class submarines Akula and Belgorod.\n\n**41st Missile Boat Brigade**\n\nThe 41st Missile Boat Brigade is a surface force of the Black Sea Fleet, consisting of several missile boats, including the Buyan-class missile boats Buyan and Buyan-M.\n\n**68th Coastal Defense Ship Brigade**\n\nThe 68th Coastal Defense Ship Brigade is a surface force of the Black Sea Fleet, consisting of several coastal defense ships, including the Ivan Pustoshkin-class patrol boats Ivan Pustoshkin and Igor Pustoshkin.\n\n**184th Novorossiysk Coastal Defense Brigade**\n\nThe 184th Novorossiysk Coastal Defense Brigade is a surface force of the Black Sea Fleet, consisting of several coastal defense ships, including the Ivan Pustoshkin-class patrol boats Ivan Pustoshkin and Igor Pustoshkin.\n\n**197th Assault Ship Brigade**\n\nThe 197th Assault Ship Brigade is a surface force of the Black Sea Fleet, consisting of several assault ships, including the Ropucha-class landing ships Ropucha and Korolev.\n\n**Black Sea Fleet Ground Forces, Naval Infantry, and Surface-to-Surface Missile Forces**\n\nThe Black Sea Fleet has a significant ground force component, consisting of several naval infantry brigades, including the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade, as well as several surface-to-surface missile brigades.\n\n**Black Sea Fleet Aviation and Air Defence Forces**\n\nThe Black Sea Fleet has a significant aviation component, consisting of several naval aviation divisions, including the 2nd Guards Naval Aviation Division and the 27th Composite Aviation Division.\n\nThe Black Sea Fleet's aviation forces are primarily based at the Hvardiyske Air Base, which is located near the city of Sevastopol. The base is home to several squadrons of Su-30SM and Su-24M2 aircraft, as well as several squadrons of Ka-52K and Ka-31 helicopters.\n\n**Incidents**\n\nThe Russian Black Sea Fleet's use of leased facilities in Sevastopol and the Crimea was sometimes controversial. A number of incidents took place, including the 2013 annexation of Crimea by Russia, which led to a significant deterioration in relations between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nIn 2018, a US Navy destroyer was involved in a collision with a Russian Navy ship in the Black Sea, which resulted in significant damage to both vessels.\n\nIn 2020, a Russian Navy submarine was involved in a collision with a Turkish Navy ship in the Black Sea, which resulted in significant damage to both vessels.\n\nIn 2022, a Russian Navy ship was involved in a collision with a Ukrainian Navy ship in the Black Sea, which resulted in significant damage to both vessels.\n\nThe Black Sea Fleet's use of leased facilities in Sevastopol and the Crimea has also been the subject of controversy, with some countries objecting to Russia's use of the facilities for military purposes.\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Black Sea Fleet\".

while Ushakov's victory at Tendra allowed the Russians to begin the siege of Izmail, a potent Ottoman stronghold by the Black Sea, which was twice besieged without effect.\n\n\nImperial Russian

Tendra allowed the Russians to begin the siege of Izmail, a potent Ottoman stronghold by the Black Sea, which was twice besieged without effect.\n\n\nCrimean War\nWithin the Black Sea itself, the Turks found themselves at a naval disadvantage in relation to the Russian Black Sea Fleet In 1853, the Black Sea Fleet destroyed Turkish naval forces at the Battle of Sinop after the Turks had declared war on Russia Nevertheless, during the ensuing Crimean War, the Russians were placed on the defensive and the allies were able to land their forces in Crimea and, ultimately, capture Sevastopol [9]\n\n\n1877 conflict with Turkey\nThis hampered the Russians during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 and in the aftermath of that conflict, Russia moved to reconstitute its naval strength and fortifications in the Black Sea [citation needed]\n\n\n1905 revolution\nThe Black Sea Fleet would play an instrumental political role in the 1905 Russian Revolution with the crew of the battleship Potemkin revolting in 1905 soon after the Navy's defeat in the Russo-Japanese War The revolt acquired a symbolic character in the lead up to the Russian Revolutions of 1917 and after, as portrayed in the 1925 film by Sergei Eisenstein, Battleship Potemkin Lenin wrote that the Potemkin uprising had had a huge importance in terms of being the first attempt at creating the nucleus of a revolutionary army [citation needed]\n\n\nWorld War I and Russian Civil War\nDuring World War I, there were a number of encounters between the Russian and Ottoman navies in the Black Sea The Ottomans initially had the advantage due to having under their command the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben, but after the two modern Russian dreadnoughts Imperatritsa Mariya and Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya had been built in Nikolaev, the Russians took command of the sea until the Russian government collapsed in November 1917 German submarines of the Constantinople Flotilla and Turkish light forces would continue to raid and harass Russian shipping until the war's end.\n\n\nSoviet Navy\nWith the defeat of the anti-Bolshevik Armed Forces of South Russia, the Soviet government took control of all naval elements The few ships that remained in the Black Sea were scrapped in the 1920s and a large scale new construction programme began in the 1930s Over 500 new ships were built [citation needed] during that period and a massive expansion of coastal infrastructure took place The Black Sea Fleet was commanded by Vice Admiral F.S Oktyabrskiy on the outbreak of war with Germany in June 1941.\n\n\nWorld War II\nDuring World War II despite the scale of the German/Axis advance in southern Russia, and the capture of Crimea by Axis forces in mid-1942, the Fleet, though badly mauled, gave a creditable account of itself as it fought alongside the Red Army during the Siege of Odessa and the Battle of Sevastopol [11]\n\n\nCold War\nWith the end of World War II, the Soviet Union effectively dominated the Black Sea region The Soviet Union controlled the entire north and east of the Black Sea while pro-Soviet regimes were installed in Romania and Bulgaria As members of the Warsaw Pact, the Romanian and Bulgarian navies supplemented the strength of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet [13] Only Turkey remained outside the Soviet Black Sea security regime and the Soviets initially pressed for joint control of the Bosporus Straits with Turkey; a position which Turkey rejected [14]\n\n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union\nWith the fall of the Soviet Union and the demise of the Warsaw Pact, the military importance of the fleet was degraded and it suffered significant funding cuts and the loss of its major missions.\n\n\nJoint Fleet and its partition\nPresidents Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine and Boris Yeltsin of Russia negotiated terms for dividing the fleet, and to ease the tensions, on 10 June 1995 the two governments signed an interim treaty, [24] establishing a joint Russo-Ukrainian Black Sea Fleet under bilateral command (and Soviet Navy flag) until a full-scale partition agreement could be reached Formally, the Fleet's Commander was to be appointed by a joint order of the two countries' presidents However, Russia still dominated the Fleet unofficially, and a Russian admiral was appointed as Commander; the majority of the fleet personnel adopted Russian citizenship Minor tensions between the Fleet and the new Ukrainian Navy (such as electricity cut-offs and sailors' street-fighting) continued.\n\n\nGeorgia in the Fleet partition\nThe newly independent nation of Georgia, which also hosted several bases of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet when it was the Georgian SSR, also claimed a share of the Fleet, including 32 naval vessels formerly stationed at Georgia's Black Sea port of Poti Not a CIS member at that time, Georgia was not, however, included in the initial negotiations in January 1992 Additionally, some low-importance bases situated in the Russian-backed breakaway autonomy of Abkhazia soon escaped any Georgian control [40]\n\n\nRusso-Ukrainian War\nThe 2014 political crisis in Ukraine rapidly engulfed Crimea where pro-Russian separatist sentiment was strong [43] [44] [45] [better source needed] When the Russian Government determined to seize Crimea, specialist Russian military units appear to have played the central role In March, the Ukrainians claimed that units of the 18th Motor Rifle Brigade, 31st Air Assault Brigade and 22nd Spetsnaz Brigade were deployed and operating in Crimea, instead of Black Sea Fleet personnel, which violated international agreements signed by Ukraine and Russia [46] [47] Nevertheless, at minimum the Black Sea Fleet played a supporting role including with respect to preventing the departure of Ukrainian naval vessels from Crimea [48] Other sources suggested that the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade of the Fleet was also involved [49]\n\n\nRussian annexation of Crimea\nThe 2014 political crisis in Ukraine rapidly engulfed Crimea where pro-Russian separatist sentiment was strong [43] [44] [45] [better source needed] When the Russian Government determined to seize Crimea, specialist Russian military units appear to have played the central role In March, the Ukrainians claimed that units of the 18th Motor Rifle Brigade, 31st Air Assault Brigade and 22nd Spetsnaz Brigade were deployed and operating in Crimea,

with respect to preventing the departure of Ukrainian naval vessels from Crimea [48] Other sources suggested that the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade of the Fleet was also involved [49]\n\n\nStrengthening the fleet\nFrom that point, Russia proceeded to consolidate its military position in Crimea, which it now regards as an integral part of the Russian Federation, though this position is not one supported by the vast majority of the international community The Russian seizure of Crimea in 2014 changed the situation and role of the Black Sea Fleet significantly Analysis undertaken by Micheal Peterson of the US Naval War College suggested that since the Russian seizure of Crimea, the modernization of Russian shore-based assets and of the Black Sea Fleet itself assisted in re-establishing Russian military dominance in the region Specifically Peterson argued in 2019: \"Russian maritime dominance in the Black Sea is back The shift was made possible by Moscow's 2014 seizure of Crimea and subsequent buildup of combat and maritime law enforcement capabilities in the region\" [57]\n\n\nRusso-Ukrainian naval standoff\nOn 29 January 2021, three US naval vessels entered the Black Sea for the first time in three years [75] On 1 February, the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky argued for NATO membership for Ukraine [76] On 19 March, another significant US naval deployment to the Black Sea took place, as cruiser USS Monterey and destroyer USS Thomas Hudner entered the sea on 19 and 20 March respectively [77] [78] Prior to the scheduled deployment, on 12

and border guards said they fired warning shots from coast guard patrol ships and dropped bombs from a Sukhoi Su-24 attack aircraft in the path of Defender after, according to the Russian Defence Ministry, it had allegedly strayed for about 20 minutes as far as 3 km (2 miles) into waters off the coast of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014 in a move mostly unrecognised internationally [100] [101] The UK military denied any warning shots were fired and said the ship was in innocent passage in Ukraine's territorial sea, later clarifying that heavy guns were fired three miles astern and could not be considered to be warning shots [102] [103] [104]\n\n\n2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\nA build-up of Russian forces around Ukraine and in Belarus began toward the end of 2021, ostensibly for exercises In February 2022, the Black Sea Fleet was reinforced by six landing ships: three Ropucha-class landing ships (Minsk (127), Korolev (130) and Kaliningrad (102)) were drawn from the Baltic

Northern Fleet [105] The 22nd Army Corps (subordinate to the Black Sea Fleet) was also reinforced, including by the 247th Regiment of the 7th Guards Mountain Air Assault Division as well as by the 56th Guards Air Assault Regiment, subordinate to the same division [106] On the eve of the conflict, it was reported that the headquarters of the 58th Combined Arms Army had deployed to Crimea commanding between 12 and 17 battalion tactical groups [107] [108]\n\n\nCommanders\nThe Black Sea Fleet, and other Russian ground and air forces in Crimea, are subordinate to the Southern Military

Born on September 25, 1984, Svartholm has been involved in various online activities, including the creation of websites and forums that have sparked controversy and debate.\n\n**Americas Dumbest Soldiers and meeting Fredrik Neij**\n\nSvartholm's online career began in 2003 when he created the website Americas Dumbest Soldiers, a platform that listed deceased US soldiers in the Iraq War and invited users to rate how \"dumb\" the soldiers were based on how they died. The website was a provocative and satirical take on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Fredrik Neij, another Swedish programmer, provided Svartholm's website access to the internet via British Telecom. According to Neij, someone at the US State Department contacted the head of British Telecom, who in turn contacted the head of the Swedish provider that Neij worked for. The Swedish provider then asked Svartholm and Neij to remove the website. Svartholm and Neij questioned the request, invoking freedom of speech and parody laws, but eventually removed the website.\n\n**The Pirate Bay**\n\nSvartholm co-founded The Pirate Bay in 2003 with Fredrik Neij and Peter Sunde. At the time, it was part of the Swedish anti-copyright group and think tank Piratbyrån (Piracy Bureau). The Pirate Bay became a platform for sharing audio, video, software, and electronic games. According to Svartholm, Piratbyrån was mainly involved with political operations such as rallies, petitions, and lobbying for changes to copyright law. The Pirate Bay's stated goal is to \"help people freely exchange information.\" Svartholm and his co-founders argued that their website was a platform for promoting information sharing and not a business that profited from piracy.\n\n**Legal issues**\n\nThe Swedish police first raided The Pirate Bay on May 31, 2006, on suspicion that it operated as a business infringing on copyrights. The police confiscated servers and questioned its administrators, including Svartholm. On January 31, 2008, The Pirate Bay operators – Peter Sunde, Fredrik Neij, Gottfrid Svartholm, and Carl Lundström (CEO of The Pirate Bay's former ISP) – were charged with \"promoting other people's infringements of copyright laws.\" The trial began on February 16, 2009. Svartholm, along with Neij and Lundström, defended The Pirate Bay by arguing that they did not profit from piracy since users were not charged for its services and merely relied on website advertising as their source of revenue. On April 17, 2009, Sunde and his co-defendants were found guilty of \"assisting in making copyright content available\" in the Stockholm District Court. Each defendant was sentenced to one year in prison and ordered to pay damages of 30 million SEK (approximately €3,390,317 or US$4,222,980) to be apportioned among the four defendants.\n\n**Arrest in Cambodia**\n\nOn August 30, 2012, at the request of Swedish authorities, Svartholm was arrested by Cambodian police in the capital Phnom Penh, where he had been living for several years. Cambodia has no extradition treaty with Sweden, but Cambodian police spokesman Kirth Chantharith told the AFP news agency \"we'll look into our laws and see how we can handle this case.\" Subsequently, Cambodian police were reportedly stating that the Swedish government had requested that Gottfrid be deported in connection with \"a crime related to information technology.\"\n\n**References**\n\n**External links**\n\nThe article about Gottfrid Svartholm includes information about his online activities, the creation of The Pirate Bay, and his involvement in various legal issues.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gottfrid_Svartholm\" following this outline:\n\n\nAmericas Dumbest Soldiers and meeting Fredrik Neij\n\nSvartholm Warg started the website Americas Dumbest Soldiers which listed deceased US soldiers in the Iraq War and asked users of the site to rate how \"dumb\" the soldiers were based on how they died Fredrik Neij provided Svartholm Warg's website access to the internet via British Telecom According to Neij, someone at the US State Department contacted the head of British Telecom, who in turn contacted the head of the Swedish provider which Neij worked for, who then asked Svartholm Warg and Neij to remove the site Invoking freedom of speech and parody laws, Svartholm Warg and Neij questioned the request but eventually removed the site [9]\n\n\nThe Pirate Bay\nSvartholm Warg co-founded The Pirate Bay in 2003 with Fredrik Neij and Peter Sunde At the time, it was part of the Swedish anti-copyright group and think tank Piratbyrån (Piracy Bureau) and became a platform for sharing audio, video, software and electronic games [10] According to Svartholm, Piratbyrån was mainly involved with political operations such as rallies, petitions and lobbying for changes to copyright law, while The Pirate Bay's stated goal is to \"help people freely exchange information\" [11]\n\n\nLegal issues\nThe Swedish police first raided The Pirate Bay on 31 May 2006 on suspicion that it operated as a business infringing on copyrights [13] The police confiscated servers and questioned its administrators including Svartholm [13] On 31 January 2008, The Pirate Bay operators – Peter Sunde, Fredrik Neij, Gottfrid Svartholm and Carl Lundström (CEO of The Pirate Bay's former ISP) – were charged with \"promoting other people’s infringements of copyright laws\" [14] The trial began on 16 February 2009 Svartholm, along with Neij and Lundström, defended Piratebay by arguing that they did not profit from piracy since users were not charged for its services and merely relied on website advertising as their source of revenue [10] On 17 April 2009, Sunde and his co-defendants were found to be guilty of \"assisting in making copyright content available\" in the Stockholm District Court Each defendant was sentenced to one year in prison and they were ordered to pay damages of 30 million SEK (approximately €3,390,317 or US$4,222,980), to be apportioned among the four defendants [15] The defendants' lawyers have appealed to the Svea Court of Appeal together with a request for a retrial in the district court because of a recent suspicion of bias by judge Tomas Norström [16] Under Swedish law, the verdict is not lawful until all appeals have been processed [17]\n\n\nArrest in Cambodia\nOn 30 August 2012, at the request of Swedish authorities, Svartholm was arrested by Cambodian police in the capital Phnom Penh, [20] where he had been living for several years [21] Cambodia has no extradition treaty with Sweden, but Cambodian police spokesman Kirth Chantharith told the AFP news agency \"we'll look into our laws and see how we can handle this case\" Subsequently, Cambodian police were reportedly stating that the Swedish government had requested that Gottfrid be deported in connection with \"a crime related to information technology\" [22]\n\n\nReferences\n Media related to Gottfrid Svartholm at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Gottfrid Svartholm at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Andrews is a renowned British actress, singer, and author, known for her iconic roles in film, television, and stage productions. With a career spanning over six decades, Andrews has become a beloved figure in the entertainment industry, celebrated for her versatility, talent, and dedication to her craft.\n\n## Early Life and Vocal Training\n\nJulia Elizabeth Wells was born on 1 October 1935 in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, England. Her mother, Barbara Ward Wells (née Morris), was born in Chertsey, and married Edward Charles \"Ted\" Wells in 1932. Andrews was conceived as a result of an affair her mother had with a family friend. Andrews learned of her true parentage from her mother in 1950, although it was not publicly disclosed until her 2008 autobiography.\n\nAndrews's early life was marked by her love for music and performance. She began singing with her parents at a young age, performing spontaneously and unbilled on stage with them. Andrews stood on a beer crate to sing into the microphone, performing solo or duets with her stepfather, while her mother played piano. This early exposure to the stage helped shape her passion for performance and laid the foundation for her future career.\n\n## Career\n\n### 1945-1953: Early Career\n\nAndrews's professional career began in the early 1940s, when she started performing with her parents on stage. In 1945, Andrews and her parents began touring around the UK, singing for the troops and performing at various venues. Petula Clark, a fellow child entertainer, recalled touring with Andrews and sleeping in the luggage racks. Clark later said, \"It was fun—and not a lot of kids were having fun.\"\n\nAndrews's early career was marked by her determination and hard work. She continued to perform with her parents, honing her skills and developing her craft. Andrews's early experiences on stage helped her build confidence and prepared her for the challenges of a professional career.\n\n### 1954-1962: Broadway Debut and Breakthrough\n\nOn 30 September 1954, the eve of her 19th birthday, Andrews made her Broadway debut as Polly Browne in the London musical The Boy Friend. Andrews was recommended to director Vida Hope for the part by actress Hattie Jacques, whom Andrews regards as a \"catalyst\" for her career. Eve Benda recognized her special talent and predicted her stardom. Andrews was anxious about moving to New York, but her father encouraged her to take the part.\n\nAndrews's Broadway debut marked the beginning of her rise to stardom. She continued to perform in various stage productions, including the musicals The Girl Friend and Camelot. In 1960, Andrews made her television debut in the musical The Sound of Music, which was based on the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical.\n\n### 1963-1967: Mary Poppins and Film Stardom\n\nIn 1963, Andrews began work in the titular role of Disney's musical film Mary Poppins. Walt Disney had seen her performance in Camelot and subsequently offered her the role. Andrews initially declined because of pregnancy, returning to London to give birth. However, Disney firmly insisted, saying, \"We'll wait for you.\"\n\nAfter the birth of her daughter, Emma Walton Hamilton, Andrews received a call from P.L. Travers, author of the Mary Poppins book series, who told her, \"Well, you're much too pretty of course, but you've got the nose for it.\" Disney rented a house in Toluca Lake, Los Angeles, for Andrews's family to reside in during production.\n\nAndrews relied largely on instinct for her portrayal, conceptualizing her background and giving the character a \"particular walk\" and a turned-out stance to suit her ladylike sensibility. Andrews referred to production as \"unrelenting\" given the physical exertion and technical details, saying that she \"could not have asked\" for a better introduction to film.\n\n## 1968-1996: Career Setbacks and Mid-Career\n\nAndrews next appeared in two of Hollywood's most expensive flops: Star! (1968), a biopic of Gertrude Lawrence, and Darling Lili (1970), co-starring Rock Hudson and directed by her second husband, Blake Edwards. Andrews \"went through her usual period of insecurity\" during the production of Star!, intensely analyzing her choices for the character.\n\nChoreographer Michael Kidd worked closely with Andrews during the complicated musical numbers, which Andrews regarded as physically and mentally grueling, coupled with her divorce from her first husband, Tony Walton. The New York Times singled out the film as \"not one of [Andrews]'s best,\" while Variety wrote her \"carefully built-up\" performance \"sagged\" with \"overdone hoydenishness.\"\n\nDespite reviews, Andrews's performance was once again nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. Andrews regarded her friendships with Kidd and director Robert Wise as her \"greatest gifts\" from the film.\n\n## 2000-Present: Children's Entertainment and Later Roles\n\nA botched vocal surgery in 1997 led to the loss of Andrews's singing voice, occasioning her refusal to sing on camera for several years. Despite this, Andrews kept busy with many projects. In 1998, she appeared in a stage production of Dr. Dolittle in London.

He was the fourth of eight children born to Mauritanian immigrant parents, Diaratou and Demba Sy. Both of his parents worked hard to provide for their family, with his mother working as a house cleaner and his father working in an auto parts factory. The family had a modest background, and Sy's parents instilled in him the importance of education and hard work.\n\nSy's upbringing was deeply influenced by his Fulani heritage. His family spoke Pulaar, a Fulani language, at home, and they would often visit Senegal, where they had roots, during the summer. This cultural exposure had a significant impact on Sy's identity and shaped his worldview.\n\nGrowing up in Trappes, Sy attended local schools and developed an interest in comedy at a young age. He was influenced by French comedians such as Jamel Debbouze and Omar's own partner, Fred Testot. Sy's family encouraged his creative pursuits, and he began performing in local talent shows and comedy sketches.\n\n## Career\n\nSy's professional career began after he finished high school in 1996. He landed a job at Radio Nova, where he met Fred Testot, who would become his comedy partner and close friend. Sy's early career was marked by a series of small roles in French television shows and films. He appeared in the TV show \"Le Cinéma de Jamel\" on Canal+, where he worked alongside Jamel Debbouze. Sy's breakthrough role came when he created and starred in the TV show \"Le Visiophon.\"\n\nSy's subsequent work included appearances in various TV and stage shows, such as \"Je ne fais pas mon âge\" and \"Omar et Fred: le spectacle.\" However, his most notable role to date has been co-hosting the French short comedy television series \"Service après-vente des émissions\" with Fred Testot from 2005 to 2012 on Canal+.

the wing's leading edge sweep angle was decreased from 48° to 42°, while the vertical stabilizers were shifted rearward and decreased in area by 20% [23] The radome shape was changed for better radar performance, the wingtips were clipped for antennas, and the dedicated airbrake was eliminated To improve pilot visibility and aerodynamics, the canopy was moved forward 7 inches (18 cm) and the engine inlets moved rearward 14 inches (36 cm) The shapes of the fuselage, wing, and stabilator trailing edges were refined to improve aerodynamics, strength, and stealth characteristics The internal structural design was refined and reinforced, with the production airframe designed for a service life of 8,000 hours [22] [24] The revised shaping would be validated with over 17,000 additional hours of wind tunnel testing and further RCS testing at Helendale, California and the USAF RATSCAT range before first flight Increasing weight during EMD due to demanding ballistic survivability requirements and added capabilities caused slight reductions in projected range and maneuver performance [25]\n\n\nProduction and procurement\nThe USAF originally envisioned ordering 750 ATFs at a total program cost of $44.3 billion and procurement cost of $26.2 billion in FY 1985 dollars, with production beginning in 1994 and service entry in the mid-to-late 1990s The 1990 Major Aircraft Review (MAR) led by Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney reduced this to 648 aircraft beginning in 1996 and service entry in the early-to-mid 2000s After the end of the Cold War, this was further curtailed to 442 in the 1993 Bottom-Up Review while the USAF eventually set its requirement to 381 to support its Air Expeditionary Force structure with the last deliveries in 2013 Throughout development and production, the program was continually scrutinized for its costs and less expensive alternatives such as modernized F-15 or F-16 variants were being proposed, even though the USAF considered the F-22 to provide the greatest capability increase against peer adversaries for the investment [39] However, funding instability had reduced the total to 339 by 1997 and production was nearly halted by Congress in 1999 [N 9] Although funds were eventually restored, the planned number continued to decline due to delays and cost overruns during EMD, slipping to 277 by 2003 [41] [42] In 2004, with its focus on asymmetric counterinsurgency warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan, the DoD under Secretary Donald Rumsfeld further cut the planned F-22 procurement to 183 production aircraft, despite the USAF's requirement for 381; [43] [44] funding for this number was reached by a multi-year procurement contract awarded in 2006, with aircraft distributed to seven combat squadrons; total program cost was projected to be $62 billion (~$90.2 billion in 2023) [45] In 2008, Congress passed a defense spending bill that raised the total orders for production aircraft to 187 [46] [47]\n\n\nBan on exports\nIn order to prevent the inadvertent disclosure of the aircraft's stealth technology and classified capabilities to the U.S.'s adversaries, [57] [58] annual DoD appropriations acts since FY1998 have included a provision prohibiting the use of funds made available in each act to approve or license the sale of the F-22 to any foreign government [59] Customers for U.S fighters are acquiring earlier designs such as the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon or the newer F-35 Lightning II, which contains technology from the F-22 but was designed to be cheaper, more flexible, and available for export [60] In September 2006, Congress upheld the ban on foreign F-22 sales [61] Despite the ban, the 2010 defense authorization bill included provisions requiring the DoD to report on the costs and feasibility for an F-22 export variant, and another report on the effect of export sales on the U.S aerospace industry [62] [63]\n\n\nProduction termination\nThroughout the 2000s when the U.S was primarily fighting counterinsurgency wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the USAF's requirement for 381 F-22s was questioned over rising costs, initial reliability and availability problems, limited multirole versatility, and a lack of relevant adversaries for air combat missions [60] [76] In 2006, Comptroller General of the United States David Walker found that \"the DoD has not demonstrated the need\" for more investment in the F-22, [77] and further opposition was expressed by Bush Administration Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and his successor Robert Gates, Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon R England, and Chairman of U.S Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) Senators John Warner and John McCain [78] [79] Under Rumsfeld, procurement was severely cut to 183 aircraft The F-22 lost influential supporters in 2008 after the forced resignations of Secretary of the Air Force Michael Wynne and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force General T Michael Moseley [80] In November 2008, Gates stated that the F-22 lacked relevance in asymmetric post-Cold War conflicts, [81] and in April 2009, under the Obama Administration, he called for production to end in FY 2011 after completing 187 F-22s [82]\n\n\nModernization and upgrades\nThe F-22 and its subsystems were designed to be upgraded over its life cycle in anticipation for technological advances and evolving threats, although this initially proved difficult and costly due to the highly integrated avionics systems architecture The modernization and upgrades consist of software and hardware modifications captured under numbered Increments, originally called Spirals, as well as software-only Operational Flight Program (OFP) Updates [101] Amid debates over the airplane's relevance in asymmetric counterinsurgency warfare, the first Increments and OFP Updates primarily focused on ground attack, or strike capabilities Increment 2, the first upgrade program, was implemented in 2005 for Block 20 aircraft onward and enabled the employment of Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) The improved AN/APG-77(V)1 radar, which incorporates air-to-ground modes, was certified in March 2007 and fitted on airframes from Lot 5 onward [102] Increment 3.1 and Updates 3 and 4 for Block 30/35 aircraft improved ground-attack capabilities through synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mapping and radio emitter direction finding, electronic attack and Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) integration; testing began in 2009 and the first upgraded aircraft was delivered in 2011 [103] [104] To address oxygen deprivation issues, F-22s were fitted with an automatic backup oxygen system (ABOS) and modified life support system starting in 2012 [105]\n\n\nDesign\nThe F-22 Raptor (internally designated Configuration 645) is a fifth-generation air superiority fighter that is considered fourth generation in stealth aircraft technology by the USAF [124] It is the first operational aircraft to combine supercruise, supermaneuverability, stealth, and integrated avionics (or sensor fusion) in a single weapons platform to enable it to survive and conduct missions, primarily offensive and defensive counter-air operations, in highly contested environments [125]\n\n\nOverview\nThe F-22 Raptor (internally designated Configuration 645) is a fifth-generation air superiority fighter that is considered fourth generation in stealth aircraft technology by the USAF [124] It is the first operational aircraft to combine supercruise, supermaneuverability, stealth, and integrated avionics (or sensor fusion) in a single weapons platform to enable it to survive and conduct missions, primarily offensive and defensive counter-air operations, in highly contested environments [125]\n\n\nStealth\nThe F-22 was designed to be highly difficult to detect and track by radar, with radio waves reflected, scattered, or diffracted away from the emitter source towards specific sectors, or absorbed and attenuated Measures to reduce RCS include airframe shaping such as alignment of edges and continuous curvature of surfaces, internal carriage of weapons, fixed-geometry serpentine inlets and curved vanes that prevent line-of-sight of the engine fan faces and turbines from any exterior view, use of radar-absorbent material (RAM), and attention to detail such as hinges and pilot helmets that could provide a radar return [126] The F-22 was also designed to have decreased radio frequency emissions, infrared signature and acoustic signature as well as reduced visibility to the naked eye [147] The aircraft's rectangular thrust-vectoring nozzles flatten the exhaust plume and facilitate its mixing with ambient air through shed vortices, which reduces infrared emissions to mitigate the threat of infrared homing (\"heat seeking\") surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles [148] [149] Additional measures to reduce the infrared signature include special topcoat and active cooling to manage the heat buildup from supersonic flight [150] [126]\n\n\nAvionics\nThe aircraft has an integrated avionics system where through sensor fusion, data from all onboard sensor systems as well as off-board inputs are filtered and processed into a combined tactical picture, thus enhancing the pilot's situational awareness and reducing workload Key mission systems include Sanders/General Electric AN/ALR-94 electronic warfare system, Martin Marietta AN/AAR-56 infrared and ultraviolet Missile Launch Detector (MLD), Westinghouse/Texas Instruments AN/APG-77 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, TRW Communication/Navigation/Identification (CNI) suite, and Raytheon advanced infrared search and track (IRST) currently being tested [114] [159] [160]\n\n\nCockpit\nThe F-22 has a glass cockpit with all-digital flight instruments The monochrome head-up display offers a wide field of view and serves as a primary flight instrument; information is also displayed upon six color liquid-crystal display (LCD) panels [175] The primary flight controls are a force-sensitive side-stick controller and a pair of throttles The USAF initially wanted to implement direct voice input (DVI) controls, but this was judged to be too technically risky and was abandoned [176] The canopy's dimensions are approximately 140 inches long, 45 inches wide, and 27 inches tall (355 cm × 115 cm × 69 cm) and weighs 360 pounds [177] The canopy was redesigned after the original design lasted an average of 331 hours instead of the required 800 hours [76]\n\n\nArmament\nThe F-22 has three internal weapons bays: a large main bay on the bottom of the fuselage, and two smaller bays on the sides of the fuselage, aft of the engine inlets; a small bay for countermeasures such as flares is located behind each side bay [184] The main bay is split along the centerline and can accommodate six LAU-142/A launchers for beyond-visual-range (BVR) missiles and each side bay has an LAU-141/A launcher for short-range missiles The primary air-to-air missiles are the AIM-120 AMRAAM and the AIM-9 Sidewinder, with planned integration of the AIM-260 JATM [185] Missile launches require the bay doors to be open for less than a second, during which pneumatic or hydraulic arms push missiles clear of the aircraft; this is to reduce vulnerability to detection and to deploy missiles during high-speed flight [186] An internally mounted M61A2 Vulcan 20 mm rotary cannon is embedded in the airplane's right wing root with the muzzle covered by a retractable door [187] The radar projection of the cannon fire's path is displayed on the pilot's head-up display [188]\n\n\nMaintenance\nEach F-22 requires a three-week packaged maintenance plan (PMP) every 300 flight hours [193] Its stealth coatings were designed to be more robust and weather-resistant than those of earlier stealth aircraft, [143] yet early coatings failed against rain and moisture when F-22s were initially posted to Guam in 2009 [194] Stealth measures account for almost one third of maintenance, with coatings being particularly demanding [195] [30] F-22 depot maintenance is performed at Ogden Air Logistics Complex at Hill AFB, Utah; considerable care is taken during maintenance due to the small fleet size and limited attrition reserve [196]\n\n\nOperational history\nThe YF-22 was originally given the unofficial name \"Lightning II\", from the World War II Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter which persisted until the mid-1990s, when the USAF officially named the F-22 \"Raptor\" The \"Lightning II\" name was later given to the F-35 The aircraft was also briefly dubbed \"SuperStar\" and \"Rapier\" [199] In September 2002, USAF changed the Raptor's designation to F/A-22, mimicking the Navy's McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet and intended to highlight a planned ground-attack capability amid debate over the aircraft's role and relevance The F-22 designation was reinstated in December 2005, when the aircraft entered service [125] [200]\n\n\nDesignation and testing\nThe YF-22 was originally given the unofficial name \"Lightning II\", from the World War II Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter which persisted until the mid-1990s, when the USAF officially named the F-22 \"Raptor\" The \"Lightning II\" name was later given to the F-35 The aircraft was also briefly dubbed \"SuperStar\" and \"Rapier\" [199] In September 2002, USAF changed the Raptor's designation to F/A-22, mimicking the Navy's McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet and intended to highlight a planned ground-attack capability amid debate over the aircraft's role and relevance The F-22 designation was reinstated in December 2005, when the aircraft entered service [125] [200]\n\n\nTraining\nThe 43rd Fighter Squadron was reactivated in 2002 as the F-22 Formal Training Unit (FTU) for the type's basic course at Tyndall AFB Following severe damage to the installation in the wake of Hurricane Michael in 2018, the squadron and its aircraft were relocated to nearby Eglin AFB; although it was initially feared that several jets were lost due to storm damage, all were later repaired and flown out [208] The FTU and its aircraft were reassigned to the 71st Fighter Squadron at Langley AFB in 2023 [209]\n\n\nIntroduction into service\nIn December 2005, the USAF announced that the F-22 had achieved Initial Operational Capability (IOC) with the 94th Fighter Squadron [217] The unit subsequently participated in Exercise Northern Edge 06 in Alaska in June 2006 and Exercise Red Flag 07–2 at Nellis AFB in February 2007, where it demonstrated the F-22's greatly increased air combat capabilities when flying against Red Force Aggressor F-15s and F-16s with a simulated kill ratio of 108–0 These large force exercises also further refined the F-22's operational tactics and employment [45] [218]\n\n\nInitial operational problems\nDuring the initial years of service, F-22 pilots experienced symptoms as a result of oxygen system issues that include loss of consciousness, memory loss, emotional lability and neurological changes as well as lingering respiratory problems and a chronic cough; the issues resulted in a fatal mishap in 2010 and four-month grounding in 2011 and subsequent altitude and distance flight restrictions [223] [224] In August 2012, the DoD found that the BRAG valve, which inflated the pilot's vest during high-g maneuvers, was defective and restricted breathing and the OBOGS (onboard oxygen generation system) unexpectedly fluctuated oxygen levels at high g [225] [226] A Raptor Aeromedical Working Group had recommended changes in 2005 regarding oxygen supply that were unfunded but received further consideration in 2012 [227] [228] The F-22 CTF and 412th Aerospace Medicine Squadron eventually determined breathing restrictions as the root cause; coughing symptoms were attributed to acceleration atelectasis [N 18] from high g exposure and OBOGS delivering excessive oxygen concentration The presence of toxins and particles in some ground crew was deemed unrelated [229] Modifications to the life support and oxygen systems, including the installation of an automatic backup, allowed altitude and distance restrictions to be lifted in April 2013 [230]\n\n\nOperational service\nFollowing IOC and large-scale exercises, the F-22 flew its first homeland defense mission in January 2007 under Operation Noble Eagle In November 2007, F-22s of 90th Fighter Squadron at Elmendorf AFB, Alaska, performed their first North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) interception of two Russian Tu-95MS bombers [231] Since then, F-22s have also escorted probing Tu-160 bombers [232]\n\n\nVariants\nThe X-44 MANTA, or multi-axis, no-tail aircraft, was a planned experimental aircraft based on the F-22 with enhanced thrust vectoring controls and no aerodynamic surface backup [275] The aircraft was to be solely controlled by thrust vectoring, without featuring any rudders, ailerons, or elevators Funding for this program was halted in 2000 [276]\n\n\nProposed derivatives\nThe X-44 MANTA, or multi-axis, no-tail aircraft, was a planned experimental aircraft based on the F-22 with enhanced thrust vectoring controls and no aerodynamic surface backup [275] The aircraft was to be solely controlled by thrust vectoring, without featuring any rudders, ailerons, or elevators Funding for this program was halted in 2000 [276]\n\n\nOperators\nThe United States Air Force is the only operator of the F-22 As of August 2022, it has 183 aircraft in its inventory [125]\n\n\nAir Combat Command\nThe first F-22 crash occurred during takeoff at Nellis AFB on 20 December 2004, in which the pilot ejected safely before impact [291] The investigation revealed that a brief interruption in power during an engine shutdown prior to flight caused a flight-control system malfunction;

The F-22 is a multirole fighter that combines stealth, supercruise, and advanced avionics to achieve air dominance.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe F-22 originated from the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program initiated in 1981 to replace the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon. The program was influenced by intelligence reports indicating that the effectiveness of these aircraft would be quickly eroded by emerging worldwide threats. The ATF was envisaged to support the air-land battle by spearheading offensive and defensive counter-air operations in a highly contested environment.\n\n**Origins**\n\nThe F-22 was initially designated as the YF-22 and later became the F-22 Raptor. The program was plagued by delays and cost overruns, with the production cost increasing from $44.3 billion to $62 billion. The program was also subject to changes in the USAF's requirements, with the number of aircraft ordered decreasing from 750 to 381.\n\n**Full-scale development**\n\nAs the program moved to full-scale development, the F-22 design evolved significantly from the YF-22 demonstrator. The external geometry was altered, with the wing's leading edge sweep angle decreased from 48° to 42°. The radome shape was changed for better radar performance, and the wingtips were clipped for antennas. The dedicated airbrake was eliminated, and the engine inlets were moved rearward 14 inches.\n\n**Production and procurement**\n\nThe USAF originally envisioned ordering 750 ATFs, but the number was reduced to 648 in the 1990 Major Aircraft Review. The program was further curtailed to 442 in the 1993 Bottom-Up Review, and the USAF eventually set its requirement to 381 to support its Air Expeditionary Force structure. The last deliveries were made in 2013.\n\n**Ban on exports**\n\nThe DoD has imposed a ban on exporting the F-22 to any foreign government due to concerns about the disclosure of the aircraft's stealth technology and classified capabilities.\n\n**Production termination**\n\nThe F-22 program was questioned over rising costs, initial reliability and availability problems, limited multirole versatility, and a lack of relevant adversaries for air combat missions. The production was severely cut to 183 aircraft, and the program was eventually terminated in 2011.\n\n**Modernization and upgrades**\n\nThe F-22 has undergone several modernization and upgrade programs, including the Increment 2 upgrade, which enabled the employment of Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM). The Increment 3.1 upgrade improved ground-attack capabilities through synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mapping and radio emitter direction finding.\n\n**Design**\n\nThe F-22 Raptor is a fifth-generation air superiority fighter that combines stealth, supercruise, and advanced avionics. The aircraft has an integrated avionics system that processes data from various sensor systems and off-board inputs to provide a combined tactical picture.\n\n**Stealth**\n\nThe F-22 was designed to be highly difficult to detect and track by radar. The aircraft's airframe is shaped to reduce radar cross-section, and it uses radar-absorbent material to absorb and attenuate radar waves.\n\n**Avionics**\n\nThe F-22 has an advanced avionics system that includes an integrated sensor system, a cockpit management system, and a tactical data link system. The aircraft's radar system is capable of air-to-air and air-to-ground modes.\n\n**Cockpit**\n\nThe F-22 has a glass cockpit with all-digital flight instruments. The monochrome head-up display offers a wide field of view and serves as a primary flight instrument.\n\n**Armament**\n\nThe F-22 has three internal weapons bays, two on the sides of the fuselage and one on the bottom of the fuselage. The main bay is split along the centerline and can accommodate six LAU-142/A launchers for beyond-visual-range missiles.\n\n**Maintenance**\n\nThe F-22 requires a three-week packaged maintenance plan (PMP) every 300 flight hours. The stealth coatings are designed to be more robust and weather-resistant than those of earlier stealth aircraft.\n\n**Operational history**\n\nThe F-22 achieved Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in December 2005 with the 94th Fighter Squadron. The unit participated in Exercise Northern Edge 06 in Alaska in June 2006 and Exercise Red Flag 07–2 at Nellis AFB in February 2007.\n\n**Initial operational problems**\n\nThe F-22 experienced several initial operational problems, including oxygen system issues that resulted in loss of consciousness, memory loss, emotional lability, and neurological changes.\n\n**Operational service**\n\nThe F-22 has flown its first homeland defense mission in January 2007 under Operation Noble Eagle. The aircraft has also escorted probing Tu-160 bombers.\n\n**Variants**\n\nThe X-44 MANTA was a planned experimental aircraft based on the F-22 with enhanced thrust vectoring controls and no aerodynamic surface backup. The program was halted in 2000.\n\n**Operators**\n\nThe United States Air Force is the only operator of the F-22. As of August 2022, it has 183 aircraft in its inventory.\n\n**Specifications**\n\n* Length: 62 feet 1 inch (18.93 meters)\n* Wingspan: 44 feet 6 inches (13.57 meters)\n* Height: 16 feet 8 inches (5.08 meters)\n* Empty weight: 43,430 pounds (19,675 kg)\n* Maximum takeoff weight: 70,000 pounds (31,751 kg)\n* Powerplant: 2 x Pratt & Whitney F119-PW-100 turbofans\n* Thrust: 35,000 pounds-force (156 kN) each\n* Top speed: Mach 2.25 (1,451 mph or 2,336 km/h)\n* Range: 1,600 nautical miles (2,963 km)\n* Service ceiling: 60,000 feet (18,288 meters)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lockheed_Martin_F-22_Raptor\" following this outline:\n\n\nDevelopment\nThe F-22 originated from the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program that the U.S Air Force (USAF) initiated in 1981 to replace the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon Although the F-15 and F-16 had only recently entered service, intelligence reports indicated that their effectiveness would be quickly eroded by emerging worldwide threats emanating from the Soviet Union, including new developments in surface-to-air missile systems for integrated air defense networks, the introduction of the Beriev A-50 \"Mainstay\" airborne warning and control system (AWACS), and the proliferation of the Sukhoi Su-27 \"Flanker\" and Mikoyan MiG-29 \"Fulcrum\" class of fighter aircraft [3] Code-named \"Senior Sky\", the ATF would become an air superiority fighter program influenced by these reports;

to do so, the ATF would make an ambitious leap in capability and survivability by taking advantage of the new technologies in fighter design on the horizon, including composite materials, lightweight alloys, advanced flight control systems and avionics, more powerful propulsion systems for supersonic cruise (or supercruise) around Mach 1.5, and stealth technology for low observability [4] [5] [6]\n\n\nOrigins\nThe F-22 originated from the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program that the U.S Air Force (USAF) initiated in 1981 to replace the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon Although the F-15 and F-16 had only recently entered service, intelligence reports indicated that their effectiveness would be quickly eroded by emerging worldwide threats emanating from the Soviet Union, including new developments in surface-to-air missile systems for integrated air defense networks, the introduction of the Beriev A-50 \"Mainstay\" airborne warning and control system (AWACS), and the proliferation of the Sukhoi Su-27 \"Flanker\" and Mikoyan MiG-29 \"Fulcrum\" class of fighter aircraft [3] Code-named \"Senior Sky\", the ATF would become an air superiority fighter program influenced by these reports;

the wing's leading edge sweep angle was decreased from 48° to 42°, while the vertical stabilizers were shifted rearward and decreased in area by 20% [23] The radome shape was changed for better radar performance, the wingtips were clipped for antennas, and the dedicated airbrake was eliminated To improve pilot visibility and aerodynamics, the canopy was moved forward 7 inches (18 cm) and the engine inlets moved rearward 14 inches (36 cm) The shapes of the fuselage, wing, and stabilator trailing edges were refined to improve aerodynamics, strength, and stealth characteristics The internal structural design was refined and reinforced, with the production airframe designed for a service life of 8,000 hours [22] [24] The revised shaping would be validated with over 17,000 additional hours of wind tunnel testing and further RCS testing at Helendale, California and the USAF RATSCAT range before first flight Increasing weight during EMD due to demanding ballistic survivability requirements and added capabilities caused slight reductions in projected range and maneuver performance [25]\n\n\nProduction and procurement\nThe USAF originally envisioned ordering 750 ATFs at a total program cost of $44.3 billion and procurement cost of $26.2 billion in FY 1985 dollars, with production beginning in 1994 and service entry in the mid-to-late 1990s The 1990 Major Aircraft Review (MAR) led by Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney reduced this to 648 aircraft beginning in 1996 and service entry in the early-to-mid 2000s After the end of the Cold War, this was further curtailed to 442 in the 1993 Bottom-Up Review while the USAF eventually set its requirement to 381 to support its Air Expeditionary Force structure with the last deliveries in 2013 Throughout development and production, the program was continually scrutinized for its costs and less expensive alternatives such as modernized F-15 or F-16 variants were being proposed, even though the USAF considered the F-22 to provide the greatest capability increase against peer adversaries for the investment [39] However, funding instability had reduced the total to 339 by 1997 and production was nearly halted by Congress in 1999 [N 9] Although funds were eventually restored, the planned number continued to decline due to delays and cost overruns during EMD, slipping to 277 by 2003 [41] [42] In 2004, with its focus on asymmetric counterinsurgency warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan, the DoD under Secretary Donald Rumsfeld further cut the planned F-22 procurement to 183 production aircraft, despite the USAF's requirement for 381; [43] [44] funding for this number was reached by a multi-year procurement contract awarded in 2006, with aircraft distributed to seven combat squadrons; total program cost was projected to be $62 billion (~$90.2 billion in 2023) [45] In 2008, Congress passed a defense spending bill that raised the total orders for production aircraft to 187 [46] [47]\n\n\nBan on exports\nIn order to prevent the inadvertent disclosure of the aircraft's stealth technology and classified capabilities to the U.S.'s adversaries, [57] [58] annual DoD appropriations acts since FY1998 have included a provision prohibiting the use of funds made available in each act to approve or license the sale of the F-22 to any foreign government [59] Customers for U.S fighters are acquiring earlier designs such as the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon or the newer F-35 Lightning II, which contains technology from the F-22 but was designed to be cheaper, more flexible, and available for export [60] In September 2006, Congress upheld the ban on foreign F-22 sales [61] Despite the ban, the 2010 defense authorization bill included provisions requiring the DoD to report on the costs and feasibility for an F-22 export variant, and another report on the effect of export sales on the U.S aerospace industry [62] [63]\n\n\nProduction termination\nThroughout the 2000s when the U.S was primarily fighting counterinsurgency wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the USAF's requirement for 381 F-22s was questioned over rising costs, initial reliability and availability problems, limited multirole versatility, and a lack of relevant adversaries for air combat missions [60] [76] In 2006, Comptroller General of the United States David Walker found that \"the DoD has not demonstrated the need\" for more investment in the F-22, [77] and further opposition was expressed by Bush Administration Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and his successor Robert Gates, Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon R England, and Chairman of U.S Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) Senators John Warner and John McCain [78] [79] Under Rumsfeld, procurement was severely cut to 183 aircraft The F-22 lost influential supporters in 2008 after the forced resignations of Secretary of the Air Force Michael Wynne and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force General T Michael Moseley [80] In November 2008, Gates stated that the F-22 lacked relevance in asymmetric post-Cold War conflicts, [81] and in April 2009, under the Obama Administration, he called for production to end in FY 2011 after completing 187 F-22s [82]\n\n\nModernization and upgrades\nThe F-22 and its subsystems were designed to be upgraded over its life cycle in anticipation for technological advances and evolving threats, although this initially proved difficult and costly due to the highly integrated avionics systems architecture The modernization and upgrades consist of software and hardware modifications captured under numbered Increments, originally called Spirals, as well as software-only Operational Flight Program (OFP) Updates [101] Amid debates over the airplane's relevance in asymmetric counterinsurgency warfare, the first Increments and OFP Updates primarily focused on ground attack, or strike capabilities Increment 2, the first upgrade program, was implemented in 2005 for Block 20 aircraft onward and enabled the employment of Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) The improved AN/APG-77(V)1 radar, which incorporates air-to-ground modes, was certified in March 2007 and fitted on airframes from Lot 5 onward [102] Increment 3.1 and Updates 3 and 4 for Block 30/35 aircraft improved ground-attack capabilities through synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mapping and radio emitter direction finding, electronic attack and Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) integration; testing began in 2009 and the first upgraded aircraft was delivered in 2011 [103] [104] To address oxygen deprivation issues, F-22s were fitted with an automatic backup oxygen system (ABOS) and modified life support system starting in 2012 [105]\n\n\nDesign\nThe F-22 Raptor (internally designated Configuration 645) is a fifth-generation air superiority fighter that is considered fourth generation in stealth aircraft technology by the USAF [124] It is the first operational aircraft to combine supercruise, supermaneuverability, stealth, and integrated avionics (or sensor fusion) in a single weapons platform to enable it to survive and conduct missions, primarily offensive and defensive counter-air operations, in highly contested environments [125]\n\n\nOverview\nThe F-22 Raptor (internally designated Configuration 645) is a fifth-generation air superiority fighter that is considered fourth generation in stealth aircraft technology by the USAF [124] It is the first operational aircraft to combine supercruise, supermaneuverability, stealth, and integrated avionics (or sensor fusion) in a single weapons platform to enable it to survive and conduct missions, primarily offensive and defensive counter-air operations, in highly contested environments [125]\n\n\nStealth\nThe F-22 was designed to be highly difficult to detect and track by radar, with radio waves reflected, scattered, or diffracted away from the emitter source towards specific sectors, or absorbed and attenuated Measures to reduce RCS include airframe shaping such as alignment of edges and continuous curvature of surfaces, internal carriage of weapons, fixed-geometry serpentine inlets and curved vanes that prevent line-of-sight of the engine fan faces and turbines from any exterior view, use of radar-absorbent material (RAM), and attention to detail such as hinges and pilot helmets that could provide a radar return [126] The F-22 was also designed to have decreased radio frequency emissions, infrared signature and acoustic signature as well as reduced visibility to the naked eye [147] The aircraft's rectangular thrust-vectoring nozzles flatten the exhaust plume and facilitate its mixing with ambient air through shed vortices, which reduces infrared emissions to mitigate the threat of infrared homing (\"heat seeking\") surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles [148] [149] Additional measures to reduce the infrared signature include special topcoat and active cooling to manage the heat buildup from supersonic flight [150] [126]\n\n\nAvionics\nThe aircraft has an integrated avionics system where through sensor fusion, data from all onboard sensor systems as well as off-board inputs are filtered and processed into a combined tactical picture, thus enhancing the pilot's situational awareness and reducing workload Key mission systems include Sanders/General Electric AN/ALR-94 electronic warfare system, Martin Marietta AN/AAR-56 infrared and ultraviolet Missile Launch Detector (MLD), Westinghouse/Texas Instruments AN/APG-77 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, TRW Communication/Navigation/Identification (CNI) suite, and Raytheon advanced infrared search and track (IRST) currently being tested [114] [159] [160]\n\n\nCockpit\nThe F-22 has a glass cockpit with all-digital flight instruments The monochrome head-up display offers a wide field of view and serves as a primary flight instrument; information is also displayed upon six color liquid-crystal display (LCD) panels [175] The primary flight controls are a force-sensitive side-stick controller and a pair of throttles The USAF initially wanted to implement direct voice input (DVI) controls, but this was judged to be too technically risky and was abandoned [176] The canopy's dimensions are approximately 140 inches long, 45 inches wide, and 27 inches tall (355 cm × 115 cm × 69 cm) and weighs 360 pounds [177] The canopy was redesigned after the original design lasted an average of 331 hours instead of the required 800 hours [76]\n\n\nArmament\nThe F-22 has three internal weapons bays: a large main bay on the bottom of the fuselage, and two smaller bays on the sides of the fuselage, aft of the engine inlets; a small bay for countermeasures such as flares is located behind each side bay [184] The main bay is split along the centerline and can accommodate six LAU-142/A launchers for beyond-visual-range (BVR) missiles and each side bay has an LAU-141/A launcher for short-range missiles The primary air-to-air missiles are the AIM-120 AMRAAM and the AIM-9 Sidewinder, with planned integration of the AIM-260 JATM [185] Missile launches require the bay doors to be open for less than a second, during which pneumatic or hydraulic arms push missiles clear of the aircraft; this is to reduce vulnerability to detection and to deploy missiles during high-speed flight [186] An internally mounted M61A2 Vulcan 20 mm rotary cannon is embedded in the airplane's right wing root with the muzzle covered by a retractable door [187] The radar projection of the cannon fire's path is displayed on the pilot's head-up display [188]\n\n\nMaintenance\nEach F-22 requires a three-week packaged maintenance plan (PMP) every 300 flight hours [193] Its stealth coatings were designed to be more robust and weather-resistant than those of earlier stealth aircraft, [143] yet early coatings failed against rain and moisture when F-22s were initially posted to Guam in 2009 [194] Stealth measures account for almost one third of maintenance, with coatings being particularly demanding [195] [30] F-22 depot maintenance is performed at Ogden Air Logistics Complex at Hill AFB, Utah; considerable care is taken during maintenance due to the small fleet size and limited attrition reserve [196]\n\n\nOperational history\nThe YF-22 was originally given the unofficial name \"Lightning II\", from the World War II Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter which persisted until the mid-1990s, when the USAF officially named the F-22 \"Raptor\" The \"Lightning II\" name was later given to the F-35 The aircraft was also briefly dubbed \"SuperStar\" and \"Rapier\" [199] In September 2002, USAF changed the Raptor's designation to F/A-22, mimicking the Navy's McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet and intended to highlight a planned ground-attack capability amid debate over the aircraft's role and relevance The F-22 designation was reinstated in December 2005, when the aircraft entered service [125] [200]\n\n\nDesignation and testing\nThe YF-22 was originally given the unofficial name \"Lightning II\", from the World War II Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter which persisted until the mid-1990s, when the USAF officially named the F-22 \"Raptor\" The \"Lightning II\" name was later given to the F-35 The aircraft was also briefly dubbed \"SuperStar\" and \"Rapier\" [199] In September 2002, USAF changed the Raptor's designation to F/A-22, mimicking the Navy's McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet and intended to highlight a planned ground-attack capability amid debate over the aircraft's role and relevance The F-22 designation was reinstated in December 2005, when the aircraft entered service [125] [200]\n\n\nTraining\nThe 43rd Fighter Squadron was reactivated in 2002 as the F-22 Formal Training Unit (FTU) for the type's basic course at Tyndall AFB Following severe damage to the installation in the wake of Hurricane Michael in 2018, the squadron and its aircraft were relocated to nearby Eglin AFB; although it was initially feared that several jets were lost due to storm damage, all were later repaired and flown out [208] The FTU and its aircraft were reassigned to the 71st Fighter Squadron at Langley AFB in 2023 [209]\n\n\nIntroduction into service\nIn December 2005, the USAF announced that the F-22 had achieved Initial Operational Capability (IOC) with the 94th Fighter Squadron [217] The unit subsequently participated in Exercise Northern Edge 06 in Alaska in June 2006 and Exercise Red Flag 07–2 at Nellis AFB in February 2007, where it demonstrated the F-22's greatly increased air combat capabilities when flying against Red Force Aggressor F-15s and F-16s with a simulated kill ratio of 108–0 These large force exercises also further refined the F-22's operational tactics and employment [45] [218]\n\n\nInitial operational problems\nDuring the initial years of service, F-22 pilots experienced symptoms as a result of oxygen system issues that include loss of consciousness, memory loss, emotional lability and neurological changes as well as lingering respiratory problems and a chronic cough; the issues resulted in a fatal mishap in 2010 and four-month grounding in 2011 and subsequent altitude and distance flight restrictions [223] [224] In August 2012, the DoD found that the BRAG valve, which inflated the pilot's vest during high-g maneuvers, was defective and restricted breathing and the OBOGS (onboard oxygen generation system) unexpectedly fluctuated oxygen levels at high g [225] [226] A Raptor Aeromedical Working Group had recommended changes in 2005 regarding oxygen supply that were unfunded but received further consideration in 2012 [227] [228] The F-22 CTF and 412th Aerospace Medicine Squadron eventually determined breathing restrictions as the root cause; coughing symptoms were attributed to acceleration atelectasis [N 18] from high g exposure and OBOGS delivering excessive oxygen concentration The presence of toxins and particles in some ground crew was deemed unrelated [229] Modifications to the life support and oxygen systems, including the installation of an automatic backup, allowed altitude and distance restrictions to be lifted in April 2013 [230]\n\n\nOperational service\nFollowing IOC and large-scale exercises, the F-22 flew its first homeland defense mission in January 2007 under Operation Noble Eagle In November 2007, F-22s of 90th Fighter Squadron at Elmendorf AFB, Alaska, performed their first North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) interception of two Russian Tu-95MS bombers [231] Since then, F-22s have also escorted probing Tu-160 bombers [232]\n\n\nVariants\nThe X-44 MANTA, or multi-axis, no-tail aircraft, was a planned experimental aircraft based on the F-22 with enhanced thrust vectoring controls and no aerodynamic surface backup [275] The aircraft was to be solely controlled by thrust vectoring, without featuring any rudders, ailerons, or elevators Funding for this program was halted in 2000 [276]\n\n\nProposed derivatives\nThe X-44 MANTA, or multi-axis, no-tail aircraft, was a planned experimental aircraft based on the F-22 with enhanced thrust vectoring controls and no aerodynamic surface backup [275] The aircraft was to be solely controlled by thrust vectoring, without featuring any rudders, ailerons, or elevators Funding for this program was halted in 2000 [276]\n\n\nOperators\nThe United States Air Force is the only operator of the F-22 As of August 2022, it has 183 aircraft in its inventory [125]\n\n\nAir Combat Command\nThe first F-22 crash occurred during takeoff at Nellis AFB on 20 December 2004, in which the pilot ejected safely before impact [291] The investigation revealed that a brief interruption in power during an engine shutdown prior to flight caused a flight-control system malfunction;
