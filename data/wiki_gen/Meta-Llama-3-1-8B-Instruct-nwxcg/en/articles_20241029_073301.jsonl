He is the second African American to serve on the Court, after Thurgood Marshall. Thomas is known for his conservative judicial philosophy and his strong dissenting opinions on issues such as affirmative action, abortion, and LGBTQ rights.\n\nEarly life\n\nCollege of the Holy Cross and Yale Law School\n\nThomas was born on June 23, 1948, in Pin Point, Georgia, a small fishing village near Savannah. He grew up in a low-income household with his maternal grandparents, Leola and M.C. Williams, who raised him after his parents abandoned him. Thomas's grandparents instilled in him a strong work ethic and a commitment to education. Thomas attended Savannah State University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English Literature in 1971. He then attended the College of the Holy Cross, where he earned a Master of Arts degree in American History in 1974. Thomas was admitted to Yale Law School, where he earned his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in 1974. During his time at Yale, Thomas was a member of the Yale Law Journal and was awarded the Joseph Henry Beale Prize for Excellence in International Law.\n\nEarly legal career\n\nAfter graduating from Yale Law School, Thomas worked as an attorney for the Monsanto Company, a chemical manufacturing firm. In 1979, he joined the United States Department of Education as an assistant secretary for civil rights, where he worked under Secretary Terrell Bell. Thomas was responsible for enforcing civil rights laws and investigating allegations of racial and sexual harassment. In 1981, he joined the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) as the general counsel. Thomas served in this position until 1982, when he joined the Reagan Administration as the assistant secretary for civil rights at the Department of Education.\n\nDistrict of Columbia Court of Appeals\n\nIn 1990, President George H.W. Bush nominated Thomas to serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Thomas was confirmed by the Senate on March 15, 1990. During his time on the court, Thomas served as a reliable conservative vote and was known for his strong dissenting opinions on issues such as affirmative action and abortion.\n\nNomination to the Supreme Court\n\nOn July 1, 1991, President Bush nominated Thomas to fill the seat of retiring Justice Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court. The nomination was met with widespread controversy, particularly due to the allegations of Anita Hill, a former colleague of Thomas's at the EEOC.\n\nAnita Hill accusations\n\nDuring the Senate hearings on Thomas's nomination, Anita Hill accused Thomas of making unwanted advances and using derogatory language towards her during their time at the EEOC. Thomas denied the allegations, and the Senate Judiciary Committee ultimately decided to hold a second hearing on the matter.\n\nSecond hearing\n\nThe second hearing was held on October 11, 1991, and was a contentious and emotional proceeding. Hill testified again, and Thomas testified in his own defense. The hearing was broadcast live on television, and it generated widespread media attention.\n\nSenate votes\n\nOn October 15, 1991, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 7-6 to forward Thomas's nomination to the full Senate for a vote. On October 15, 1991, the full Senate voted 52-48 to confirm Thomas's nomination. Thomas was sworn in as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court on October 23, 1991.\n\nSupreme Court of the United States\n\nGovernment powers and legal structure\n\nCourt precedent\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for judicial restraint and has argued that the Court should not overstep its constitutional authority. In cases such as Lawrence v. Texas (2003) and District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), Thomas dissented from the majority's decision, arguing that the Court was overstepping its authority and imposing its own policy preferences on the American people.\n\nExecutive power\n\nThomas has been a strong supporter of executive power and has argued that the President has broad constitutional authority to take action in the face of congressional opposition. In cases such as Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006) and Boumediene v. Bush (2008), Thomas dissented from the majority's decision, arguing that the Court was undermining the President's authority to conduct foreign policy.\n\nFederalism and states' rights\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for federalism and states' rights. In cases such as Printz v. United States (1997) and United States v. Lopez (1995), Thomas dissented from the majority's decision, arguing that the Court was overstepping its authority and imposing federal regulations on the states.\n\nIndividual rights\n\nFirst Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for individual rights and has argued that the First Amendment protects freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion. In cases such as Citizens United v. FEC (2010) and Snyder v. Phelps (2011), Thomas dissented from the majority's decision, arguing that the Court was undermining the First Amendment.\n\nSecond Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for the Second Amendment and has argued that the Court should recognize an individual right to bear arms. In cases such as District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) and McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010), Thomas joined the majority's decision, arguing that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms.\n\nFourth Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for the Fourth Amendment and has argued that the Court should recognize the right of individuals to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. In cases such as Florida v. Harris (2013) and Rodriguez v. United States (2015), Thomas dissented from the majority's decision, arguing that the Court was undermining the Fourth Amendment.\n\nSixth Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for the Sixth Amendment and has argued that the Court should recognize the right of individuals to a fair trial. In cases such as Gideon v. Wainwright (1963) and Strickland v. Washington (1984), Thomas joined the majority's decision, arguing that the Sixth Amendment protects the right to a fair trial.\n\nEighth Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for the Eighth Amendment and has argued that the Court should recognize the right of individuals to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. In cases such as Gregg v. Georgia (1976) and Baze v. Rees (2008), Thomas joined the majority's decision, arguing that the Eighth Amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nFourteenth Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for the Fourteenth Amendment and has argued that the Court should recognize the right of individuals to equal protection under the law. In cases such as Brown v. Board of Education (1954) and Loving v. Virginia (1967), Thomas joined the majority's decision, arguing that the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits racial segregation and racial discrimination.\n\nAbortion and family planning\n\nThomas has been a strong opponent of abortion and has argued that the Court should recognize the right of states to regulate abortion. In cases such as Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992) and Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt (2016), Thomas dissented from the majority's decision, arguing that the Court was undermining the states' authority to regulate abortion.\n\nLGBTQ rights\n\nThomas has been a strong opponent of LGBTQ rights and has argued that the Court should not recognize same-sex marriage as a constitutional right. In cases such as Lawrence v. Texas (2003) and Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), Thomas dissented from the majority's decision, arguing that the Court was undermining traditional values and imposing its own policy preferences on the American people.\n\nOral arguments\n\nThomas has been known for his aggressive and confrontational questioning style during oral arguments. In cases such as United States v. Windsor (2013) and Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. (2014), Thomas questioned the government's arguments, arguing that the Court should not recognize the government's authority to regulate personal and religious choices.\n\nPersonal life\n\nFamily\n\nThomas was born to Leola and M.C. Williams, and he was raised by his grandparents after his parents abandoned him. Thomas married Virginia Lamp in 1987, and the couple has two children together, Joan and Jamal.\n\nReligion\n\nThomas is a devout Catholic and has credited his faith with shaping his judicial philosophy. In cases such as Employment Division v. Smith (1990), Thomas argued that the Court should recognize the right of individuals to exercise their faith freely.\n\nLiterary influences\n\nThomas has cited the works of several influential authors, including Friedrich Nietzsche, Ayn Rand, and Thomas Aquinas. In cases such as Lawrence v. Texas (2003), Thomas argued that the Court should recognize the importance of individual freedom and autonomy.\n\nMoira Smith allegations\n\nIn 2020, a former intern, Moira Smith, alleged that Thomas made unwanted advances towards her during her internship in 1992. Thomas denied the allegations, and the incident was widely reported in the media.\n\nNondisclosure of finances\n\nIn 2020, it was reported that Thomas had failed to disclose his financial information to the Supreme Court's ethics committee, despite a requirement to do so. The incident was widely reported in the media, and Thomas was criticized for his lack of transparency.\n\nHonors and recognition\n\nThomas has received numerous awards and honors for his service on the Supreme Court, including the American Bar Association's Thurgood Marshall Award and the National Bar Association's Justice Thurgood Marshall Award.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nThomas has been the subject of several books, films, and documentaries, including the book \"Clarence Thomas: A Biography\" by Tinsley E. Yarbrough, the film \"The People v. Clarence Thomas\" (1994), and the documentary \"Clarence Thomas: The Right Man\" (2013).\n\nWritings\n\nThomas has written several articles and essays on topics related to the law and judicial philosophy, including a book of essays titled \"My Grandfather's Son: A Memoir\" (2007).\n\nSee also\n\n* History of the Supreme Court of the United States\n* List of Supreme Court justices by court composition\n* List of Supreme Court cases by the Supreme Court of the United States\n* List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\nBiographical information on Clarence Thomas from the Oyez Project at the Illinois Institute of Technology College of Law", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Clarence_Thomas\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n##College of the Holy Cross and Yale Law School\n#Early legal career\n#District of Columbia Court of Appeals\n#Nomination to the Supreme Court\n##Anita Hill accusations\n###Second hearing\n##Senate votes\n#Supreme Court of the United States\n##Government powers and legal structure\n###Court precedent\n###Executive power\n###Federalism and states' rights\n##Individual rights\n###First Amendment\n###Second Amendment\n###Fourth Amendment\n###Sixth Amendment\n###Eighth Amendment\n###Fourteenth Amendment\n###Abortion and family planning\n###LGBTQ rights\n##Oral arguments\n#Personal life\n##Family\n##Religion\n##Literary influences\n##Moira Smith allegations\n##Nondisclosure of finances\n#Honors and recognition\n#In popular culture\n#Writings\n#See also\n#Footnotes\n#References\n##Bibliography\n#Further reading\n#External links\n##Biographical\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The event was the 43rd edition of the World Women's Curling Championship, and it featured 13 teams from around the world competing for the title.\n\nQualification\n\nThe qualification process for the 2022 World Women's Curling Championship was overseen by the World Curling Federation (WCF). The top eight teams from the 2021 World Women's Curling Championship qualified automatically, while the remaining five spots were determined through various regional and continental qualifying events.\n\nRussian participation\n\nDue to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the Russian curling team was not allowed to participate in the 2022 World Women's Curling Championship.\n\nCOVID-19 issues\n\nSeveral teams and players were affected by COVID-19 issues during the championship. The Scottish team, led by Eve Muirhead, had to undergo a two-week quarantine before the start of the tournament. However, they were eventually cleared to compete and went on to win the silver medal.\n\nJapan was also affected by COVID-19, with several team members testing positive for the virus. Despite this, the team managed to complete their round-robin schedule, but their playoff hopes were ultimately dashed.\n\nTeams\n\nThe 13 teams that participated in the 2022 World Women's Curling Championship were:\n\n1.

The hammer is a technical advantage that allows a team to throw the final stone in an end, regardless of the score.\n\nRound-robin standings\n\nAfter the completion of the round-robin schedule, the standings were as follows:\n\n1.  Canada (6-1)\n2.  Scotland (5-2)\n3.  Sweden (5-2)\n4.  Japan (4-3)\n5.  South Korea (4-3)\n6.  China (3-4)\n7.  Great Britain (3-4)\n8.  Switzerland (3-4)\n9.  Denmark (2-5)\n10.

Born on September 26, 1948, in Cambridge, England, Newton-John is best known for her hit singles, including \"I Honestly Love You,\" \"You're the One That I Want,\" and \"Physical.\" She has won numerous awards, including four Grammy Awards, and has been a vocal advocate for various social causes, including cancer research and the rights of women and children.\n\n**Early Life and Family**\n\nOlivia Newton-John was born to Brinley and Irene Newton-John, a Welsh physicist and a piano teacher, respectively. She has an older brother, Hugh, and a younger sister, Rona. The family moved to Australia in 1954, when Newton-John was six years old, and settled in Melbourne. Newton-John's early life was marked by a love of music, and she began performing at a young age, singing with her siblings in a local church choir.\n\nNewton-John's parents encouraged her love of music, and she began taking piano lessons at the age of seven. She also began singing lessons with a local singing teacher, and by the time she was 10 years old, she was performing on local television and radio programs. Newton-John's family was supportive of her ambitions, and her parents encouraged her to pursue a career in music.\n\n**Career**\n\n**Career Beginnings**\n\nNewton-John's music career began in the late 1960s, when she formed a folk trio called Sol Four with two friends, Pat Avery and Brenda Holloway. The group released a few singles, but it was not a commercial success. In 1969, Newton-John traveled to the United States to pursue a solo career, but she was not successful at first. She continued to perform and record music, but it wasn't until the early 1970s that she began to achieve success.\n\n**1971–1974: Early Success**\n\nNewton-John's breakthrough came in 1971, when she released her debut album, \"If Not for You.\" The album was a moderate success, but it was her second album, \"Olivia,\" that brought her to wider attention. The album included the hit single \"If You Love Me (Let Me Know),\" which reached the top 10 in the US. Newton-John's early success was marked by her unique blend of folk, pop, and country music styles.\n\n**1975–1977: Have You Never Been Mellow, Clearly Love, and Continued Success**\n\nNewton-John's popularity continued to grow in the mid-to-late 1970s, with the release of her albums \"Have You Never Been Mellow\" and \"Clearly Love.\" The albums included hit singles such as \"Have You Never Been Mellow\" and \"You're the One That I Want,\" which reached the top of the charts in the US and Australia. Newton-John's success was not limited to music alone; she also began to appear on television and in films, including the popular TV series \"The Good Guys\" and the film \"Toomorrow.\"\n\n**1978–1979: Grease and Totally Hot**\n\nNewton-John's biggest success came in 1978, when she starred in the film \"Grease,\" alongside John Travolta.

The storm brought heavy snowfall, high winds, and freezing temperatures, causing widespread disruptions and damage.\n\nMeteorological history\n\nThe storm was a complex low-pressure system that developed over the Rocky Mountains on December 22, 2022. It strengthened rapidly as it moved eastward, driven by a strong upper-level jet stream. The system brought a mass of cold air from the Arctic that clashed with warmer air from the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in a significant temperature gradient.\n\nAs the storm moved eastward, it intensified further, with the National Weather Service (NWS) issuing a Blizzard Warning for parts of the Midwest and Northeast. The storm brought heavy snowfall, with some areas receiving over 2 feet of snow, along with high winds that reduced visibility and caused power outages.\n\nPreparations\n\nIn anticipation of the storm, various authorities and institutions took steps to prepare for the potential disruptions. Governments issued travel advisories and warnings, urging people to stay indoors and avoid non-essential travel. Schools and universities closed early, and many businesses and offices were shut down or operated on a reduced schedule.\n\nEmergency management officials stockpiled supplies and equipment, including sand, salt, and generators, to respond to the storm's impact. Transportation agencies, such as airports and highway departments, prepared for potential disruptions, including flight delays and cancellations, and road closures.\n\nImpact\n\nThe storm had a significant impact on various aspects of life, including human life, infrastructure, sports, corporate and institutional closures, and animals.\n\nDeaths\n\nThe storm was responsible for at least 25 reported deaths, with many more believed to have occurred due to hypothermia and other storm-related causes. The majority of the fatalities were reported in the Midwest and Northeast, where the storm brought the most severe conditions.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nThe storm caused significant disruptions to various forms of infrastructure, including:\n\n### Flight delays and cancellations\n\nNumerous flights were delayed or canceled at airports across the affected region, with many airlines operating reduced schedules or suspending flights altogether. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a ground stop and air traffic control restrictions to manage the flow of air traffic.\n\n### Road closures and crashes\n\nRoads were closed due to heavy snow and high winds, causing hazardous conditions for drivers. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), there were over 1,000 reported crashes and 20 fatalities attributed to the storm.\n\n### Intra-city transit disruptions\n\nPublic transportation systems, such as buses and trains, were severely impacted, with many routes suspended or operating on reduced schedules. This caused difficulties for commuters and residents who relied on public transportation.\n\n### Inter-city train delays and cancellations\n\nAmtrak and other intercity rail services were significantly disrupted, with many trains delayed or canceled. The NTSB reported that over 100 trains were affected, with many more delayed or canceled.\n\n### Energy emergencies\n\nThe storm caused energy emergencies in several areas, with power outages reported in multiple states. Utility companies worked to restore power, but in some areas, outages persisted for several days.\n\n### Power outages\n\nOver 1 million households experienced power outages, with some areas seeing extended outages. The main cause of the outages was the heavy snow and high winds, which damaged power lines and poles.\n\nSports\n\nThe storm had a significant impact on various sports events, including the NFL, NBA, and NHL. Games were postponed or canceled, and some teams were forced to play their games at different venues.\n\nCorporate and institutional closures\n\nSeveral major corporations and institutions were forced to close or operate on a reduced schedule due to the storm. This included many schools, universities, and government agencies.\n\nAnimals\n\nThe storm had a significant impact on animals, with many reported sightings of stranded or injured animals. Wildlife rehabilitation centers and animal shelters reported an influx of animals in need of care.\n\nPost-storm cold wave\n\nThe storm was followed by a prolonged cold wave that affected multiple regions, including:\n\n## Rocky Mountain region\n\nThe Rocky Mountain region was hit by a prolonged cold snap, with temperatures dropping to -20°F (-29°C) or lower in some areas. The cold wave caused widespread disruptions, including power outages and road closures.\n\n## Central United States\n\nThe central United States experienced a prolonged cold wave, with temperatures dropping to -10°F (-23°C) or lower in some areas. The cold wave caused significant disruptions, including power outages and transportation delays.\n\n## Eastern United States\n\nThe eastern United States was affected by a prolonged cold wave, with temperatures dropping to -5°F (-21°C) or lower in some areas. The cold wave caused significant disruptions, including power outages and transportation delays.\n\nSee also\n\n* List of winter storms\n* North American winter storms\n* Weather-related disasters in the United States\n\nNotes\n\n* The data and information presented in this article are based on publicly available sources and may not be comprehensive or up-to-date.\n* The article is intended to provide a general overview of the storm's impact and is not intended to be a comprehensive or definitive account of the event.\n\nReferences\n\n* National Weather Service\n* National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\n* Federal Aviation Administration\n* National Transportation Safety Board\n* National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n\nExternal links\n\n* National Weather Service: Winter Storm Summary\n* National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: Winter Storm Fatalities\n* Federal Aviation Administration: Winter Storm Air Traffic Control Restrictions\n* National Transportation Safety Board: Winter Storm Train Delays and Cancellations", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"December_2022_North_American_winter_storm\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n#Impact\n##Deaths\n##Infrastructure\n###Flight delays and cancellations\n###Road closures and crashes\n###Intra-city transit disruptions\n###Inter-city train delays and cancellations\n###Energy emergencies\n###Power outages\n##Sports\n##Corporate and institutional closures\n##Animals\n#Post-storm cold wave\n##Rocky Mountain region\n##Central United States\n##Eastern United States\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Founded in 1983, the bank's headquarters were located in Santa Clara, California, and it operated a network of branches and offices across the United States.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was a prominent player in the financial services industry, particularly in the technology sector. The bank's collapse in March 2023 sent shockwaves through the financial markets and highlighted the risks associated with the banking system. This article provides an overview of the bank's history, operations, and collapse.\n\n**Foundation and early growth**\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was founded in 1983 by Roger B. Smith, a former executive at the Bank of California. Smith's vision was to create a bank that would serve the unique financial needs of technology companies, which were rapidly growing and expanding in the Silicon Valley region. The bank initially operated with a small team of employees and a modest branch network.\n\nIn the early years, SVB focused on providing deposit and loan services to technology companies, including venture-backed startups and established firms. The bank's early success was driven by its ability to understand the financial needs of its clients and provide tailored solutions. By the late 1980s, SVB had established itself as a leading provider of financial services to the technology industry.\n\n**Expansion**\n\nThroughout the 1990s and 2000s, SVB continued to expand its operations and services. The bank opened new branches and offices in key locations, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City. SVB also expanded its product offerings to include investment banking, research, and capital markets services.\n\nIn 2008, SVB acquired a majority stake in the investment bank, Wedbush Morgan Securities, which added to its capabilities in mergers and acquisitions, equity and debt financing, and corporate advisory services. This move marked a significant milestone in SVB's expansion and solidified its position as a leading financial services provider to the technology industry.\n\n**Operations in lead-up to collapse**\n\nIn the years leading up to its collapse, SVB operated a complex business model that focused on providing deposit and loan services to technology and life science companies. The bank's business model was built around the following key components:\n\n### Business model\n\nSVB's business model was designed to capitalize on the growing demand for financial services from technology and life science companies. The bank's core products and services included:\n\n* Deposit accounts: SVB offered a range of deposit accounts, including checking and savings accounts, money market funds, and commercial deposit accounts.\n* Loans: SVB provided a variety of loan products, including term loans, lines of credit, and asset-based loans.\n* Investment banking: SVB offered investment banking services, including mergers and acquisitions, equity and debt financing, and corporate advisory services.\n* Research: SVB provided research services, including market analysis, industry trends, and company-specific research reports.\n\n### Facilities\n\nSVB operated a network of branches and offices across the United States. The bank's facilities included:\n\n* Branches: SVB had a network of branches located in major cities, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, and Boston.\n* Offices: SVB operated offices in key locations, including the Silicon Valley region, the East Coast, and Europe.\n* Data centers: SVB operated data centers to support its technology infrastructure and provide secure storage for client data.\n\n### Affiliations and community involvement\n\nSVB was an active participant in the technology industry and the broader community. The bank was affiliated with various organizations, including:\n\n* Technology industry associations: SVB was a member of various technology industry associations, including the Semiconductor Industry Association and the Information Technology Industry Council.\n* Community organizations: SVB supported community organizations, including the Silicon Valley Community Foundation and the San Francisco LGBT Community Center.\n* Philanthropic initiatives: SVB sponsored various philanthropic initiatives, including the Silicon Valley Bank Scholarship Program and the SVB Community Development Initiative.\n\n**Collapse**\n\nOn March 10, 2023, SVB announced that it would be sold to First Republic Bank, a commercial bank based in San Francisco, for approximately $2.5 billion. The sale was seen as a strategic move to stabilize the bank's operations and address concerns about its financial health.\n\nHowever, the sale was not successful, and SVB was subsequently placed into receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The FDIC announced that it would guarantee all deposits at SVB, but the bank's operations would be wound down.\n\nThe collapse of SVB sent shockwaves through the financial markets and highlighted the risks associated with the banking system. The bank's failure was attributed to a combination of factors, including a decline in deposit growth, a shift in interest rates, and a significant increase in the value of its investment portfolio.\n\nIn the aftermath of the collapse, regulators and industry experts called for greater oversight and regulation of the banking system. The collapse of SVB also led to a re-evaluation of the risks associated with the banking system and the need for greater transparency and accountability.\n\n**References**\n\nNote: This article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**Further reading**\n\nFor further information on Silicon Valley Bank, readers may want to consult the following sources:\n\n* \"The Rise and Fall of Silicon Valley Bank\" by Bloomberg Businessweek\n* \"Silicon Valley Bank: A History\" by The Financial Times\n* \"The Collapse of Silicon Valley Bank\" by Forbes\n\n**External links**\n\nFor more information on Silicon Valley Bank, readers may want to visit the following websites:\n\n* Silicon Valley Bank (official website)\n* First Republic Bank (official website)\n* Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (official website)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Silicon_Valley_Bank\" following this outline:\n\n#Foundation and early growth\n#Expansion\n#Operations in lead-up to collapse\n##Business model\n##Facilities\n##Affiliations and community involvement\n#Collapse\n#References\n##Works cited\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

These practitioners were often trained in the art of surgery through apprenticeships and hands-on experience, rather than through formal education. Surgical techniques and tools were passed down through generations of practitioners, with each new generation building upon the knowledge and skills of their predecessors.\n\nThe Roman Empire was a time of great cultural and intellectual exchange, and surgery was no exception. Roman surgeons were influenced by the medical practices of other cultures, including the Egyptians, Greeks, and Indians. They adopted and adapted a wide range of surgical techniques, including those for amputations, dissections, and other procedures.\n\n**Tools**\n\nRoman surgeons used a variety of tools to perform their work, including:\n\n### Cupping vessels\n\nCupping vessels were hollow, cup-shaped instruments that were used to create suction on the body. They were often used to treat a range of conditions, including fever, headache, and joint pain. The cupping vessels were typically made of metal or ceramic and were heated before being applied to the skin.\n\n### Chisels and raspatories\n\nChisels and raspatories were used to remove bone and tissue. Chisels were typically made of metal and were used to remove small pieces of bone, while raspatories were used to remove larger pieces.

The team's home stadium is Azadi Stadium in Tehran.\n\n# History\n\n## Early years\n\nThe history of Iranian football dates back to the early 20th century. The first football club in Iran was established in 1922, and the Iran Football Federation was founded in 1921. The team played its first international match against Afghanistan in 1941, and it was not until 1950 that the team began to participate in international competitions. Iran qualified for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, but withdrew before playing any matches.\n\n## After the Iranian Revolution\n\nFollowing the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the team's performance declined, and it did not qualify for the 1982 FIFA World Cup. However, the team made a comeback in the late 1980s and qualified for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. The team's performance improved significantly during this period, and it has since become a regular participant in international competitions.\n\n## 1998–2006\n\nThe team's performance in the 1998 FIFA World Cup was impressive, as it drew 1-1 with the United States and lost 2-1 to Germany.

These Greeks had significant cultural, economic, and political influence on the regions they inhabited. Their legacy can still be seen in the modern-day cultures and languages of these regions.\n\n**Ancient Egypt**\n\nEgypt was one of the earliest civilizations in Africa, and Greek presence in the region dates back to the 7th century BC. Greek settlement in Egypt was largely driven by trade and economic interests.\n\n### First historical colonies\n\nThe first recorded Greek colonies in Egypt were established in the 7th century BC, with the foundation of the city of Naukratis. Naukratis was a major trading center and hub for Greek merchants, and it served as a gateway to the rest of Egypt. The city was also an important center for the worship of Greek deities, including Apis and Serapis.\n\n### Hellenistic times\n\nDuring the Hellenistic period, Egypt was ruled by the Ptolemaic dynasty, which was founded by Ptolemy I Soter, one of Alexander the Great's generals. The Ptolemies were Macedonian Greeks, and they brought Greek culture and language to Egypt.\n\n#### Rule of Alexander the Great (332–323 BC)\n\nAlexander the Great's conquest of Egypt in 332 BC marked the beginning of the Hellenistic period in the region. Alexander's arrival in Egypt was met with enthusiasm by the Egyptians, who saw him as a liberator from Persian rule. During his short stay in Egypt, Alexander founded the city of Alexandria, which became a major center of Greek culture and learning.\n\n#### The Ptolemaic Empire (323–30 BC)\n\nAfter Alexander's death, his general Ptolemy I Soter took control of Egypt and established the Ptolemaic dynasty. The Ptolemies ruled Egypt for over three centuries, and during this time, Greek culture and language became deeply ingrained in Egyptian society. The Ptolemies built numerous temples and monuments, including the famous Library of Alexandria, which became a center of learning and scholarship.\n\n**Roman and Byzantine Egypt**\n\nIn 30 BC, Egypt was conquered by the Roman Empire, and it became a Roman province. During the Roman period, Greek culture continued to thrive in Egypt, and the city of Alexandria remained a major center of Greek learning and culture.\n\n#### Coptic Greeks\n\nThe Coptic Greeks were a group of Greeks who converted to Christianity and became an integral part of the Coptic Church. They played a significant role in the spread of Christianity in Egypt, and their legacy can still be seen in the modern-day Coptic Church.\n\n**Ancient Ethiopia**\n\nEthiopia was another region in Africa where Greek presence was significant. The Axumites, the ancient rulers of Ethiopia, had extensive trade and cultural ties with the Greeks.\n\n### Axumites of Ethiopia\n\nThe Axumites were a powerful kingdom that flourished in Ethiopia from the 1st century BC to the 8th century AD. They had significant cultural and economic ties with the Greeks, and their kingdom was influenced by Greek culture.\n\n### Abyssinian Greeks\n\nThe Abyssinian Greeks were a group of Greeks who settled in Ethiopia and became an integral part of the country's culture and society. They played a significant role in the spread of Christianity in Ethiopia and had a lasting impact on the country's language and culture.\n\n**Ancient Libya**\n\nLibya was another region in North Africa where Greek presence was significant. The Libyan Greeks were a group of Greeks who settled in the region and became an integral part of the local culture and society.\n\n### Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica\n\nThe Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica were a group of Greeks who settled in the region of Cyrenaica, which is now part of modern-day Libya. They played a significant role in the spread of Greek culture and language in the region and had a lasting impact on the local culture and society.\n\n### Libyan Greek culture\n\nLibyan Greek culture was a unique blend of Greek and Libyan influences. The Libyan Greeks adopted many of the Greek customs and traditions, but they also maintained their own distinct cultural identity. The city of Cyrene was a major center of Libyan Greek culture, and it was known for its beautiful architecture and vibrant cultural scene.\n\n**Ancient Nubia**\n\nNubia was a region in Africa that was heavily influenced by Greek culture. The Nubian Greeks were a group of Greeks who settled in the region and became an integral part of the local culture and society.\n\n### Axumite subjugation of Nubia\n\nIn the 1st century AD, the Axumites conquered Nubia and brought Greek culture and language to the region. The Axumites built numerous temples and monuments in Nubia, and they introduced Greek customs and traditions to the local population.\n\n### Nubian Greeks\n\nThe Nubian Greeks were a group of Greeks who settled in Nubia and became an integral part of the local culture and society. They played a significant role in the spread of Greek culture and language in the region and had a lasting impact on the local culture and society.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"African_Greeks\" following this outline:\n\n#Ancient Egypt\n##First historical colonies\n##Hellenistic times\n###Rule of Alexander the Great (332–323 BC)\n###The Ptolemaic Empire (323–30 BC)\n##Roman and Byzantine Egypt\n###Coptic Greeks\n#Ancient Ethiopia\n##Axumites of Ethiopia\n##Abyssinian Greeks\n#Ancient Libya\n##Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica\n##Libyan Greek culture\n#Ancient Nubia\n##Axumite subjugation of Nubia\n##Nubian Greeks\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This designation was established by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to accommodate athletes who meet specific criteria, such as those from countries with no NOC, or those who have been suspended from their NOCs.\n\n# Background\n\n## Timeline\n\nThe concept of Individual Neutral Athlete was first introduced at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France. However, it was not until the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia that the first athletes participated under this designation. Since then, the number of Individual Neutral Athletes has increased, with a total of 29 athletes participating in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. The IOC has continued to refine the criteria for participation as a Neutral Athlete, with the most recent changes being implemented for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.\n\n## Controversies\n\nThe designation of Individual Neutral Athlete has been the subject of controversy over the years. Some critics argue that it undermines the principle of national representation and the NOCs, while others see it as a way to provide opportunities for athletes from countries with limited resources or political instability. In 2018, the IOC faced criticism for its handling of the case of Russian athletes, who were banned from competing under their NOC due to a doping scandal, but were allowed to compete as Neutral Athletes. The decision was seen as inconsistent and unfair by some, while others argued that it was a necessary step to ensure fair competition.\n\n## Media coverage\n\nThe media coverage of Individual Neutral Athletes has varied over the years. In some cases, they have been referred to as \"Olympic Independents\" or \"Neutral Olympians,\" while in others they have been referred to simply as \"Individual Neutral Athletes.\" The media has often focused on the unique circumstances surrounding these athletes, highlighting the challenges they face in competing without the support of a NOC. In some cases, the media has also raised questions about the fairness of the system, with some arguing that it creates an uneven playing field.\n\n# Medals summary\n\nThe table below shows the number of medals won by Individual Neutral Athletes in each sport at the 2024 Summer Olympics:\n\n| Sport | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total |\n| Canoeing |  |  |  |  |\n| Cycling |  |  |  |  |\n| Gymnastics |  |  |  |  |\n| Rowing |  |  |  |  |\n| Shooting |  |  |  |  |\n| Swimming |  |  |  |  |\n| Taekwondo |  |  |  |  |\n| Tennis |  |  |  |  |\n| Weightlifting |  |  |  |  |\n| Wrestling |  |  |  |  |\n\n## Medalists\n\nThe following are the medalists in each sport:\n\n| Sport | Gold | Silver | Bronze |\n| Canoeing |  |  |  |\n| Cycling |  |  |  |\n| Gymnastics |  |  |  |\n| Rowing |  |  |  |\n| Shooting |  |  |  |\n| Swimming |  |  |  |\n| Taekwondo |  |  |  |\n| Tennis |  |  |  |\n| Weightlifting |  |  |  |\n| Wrestling |  |  |  |\n\n# Competitors\n\nThe following are the competitors who have qualified to participate as Individual Neutral Athletes at the 2024 Summer Olympics:\n\n| Athlete | Sport |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |\n\n# Canoeing\n\n## Sprint\n\nThe Individual Neutral Athletes will compete in the sprint events, which include the K-1 200m, K-1 500m, K-1 1000m, K-2 200m, K-2 500m, and K-2 1000m.

This article provides an overview of the background, political, and logistical consequences of such events, as well as lists of notable examples.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe death of a federal judge in active service is a rare but significant event. It can create a vacancy on the bench, which can have far-reaching consequences for the judiciary and the country. The process of filling a vacancy can be complex and often involves political considerations. This article provides an overview of the background, political, and logistical consequences of the death of a federal judge in active service.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe death of a federal judge in active service can occur due to various reasons, including illness, accident, or intentional harm. In some cases, the judge may die in office due to a pre-existing medical condition. In other cases, the death may be sudden and unexpected. The circumstances of the death can have a significant impact on the response of the judiciary and the federal government.\n\nThe death of a federal judge in active service can also raise questions about the fitness of the judge for office and the handling of sensitive information. In some cases, the judge may have been subject to criticism or controversy, which can add complexity to the response to the death. Overall, the death of a federal judge in active service is a significant event that requires careful consideration and attention.\n\n**Political consequences**\n\nThe death of a federal judge in active service can have significant political consequences. The vacancy created by the judge's death can be filled by a presidential nomination, which can be a contentious process. The President may choose to nominate a replacement from their own party or from the opposing party, which can lead to controversy and debate.\n\nThe nomination process can also be influenced by various factors, including the politics of the Senate, the balance of power between the parties, and the interests of special groups. In some cases, the nomination may be delayed or blocked by opposition from members of the Senate or other stakeholders.\n\nThe death of a federal judge in active service can also have implications for the balance of power within the judiciary and the federal government. The vacancy can create an opportunity for the President to shape the judiciary and promote their own agenda. However, the nomination process can also be influenced by the Senate and other stakeholders, which can limit the President's ability to shape the judiciary.\n\n**Logistical consequences**\n\nThe death of a federal judge in active service can also have significant logistical consequences. The vacancy created by the judge's death can lead to a backlog of cases, which can have a negative impact on the administration of justice. In some cases, the death may lead to a re-assignment of cases to other judges or the creation of a special panel to handle the backlog.\n\nThe death of a federal judge in active service can also have implications for the administration of the court. The vacancy can lead to a re-organization of the court's operations, including the assignment of new staff and the creation of new procedures. In some cases, the death may require the court to seek additional funding or resources to handle the backlog of cases.\n\n**Lists**\n\nThe following lists provide examples of notable deaths of federal judges in active service:\n\n### 1789–1869\n\n* **John Jay** (1795–1800), first Chief Justice of the United States, died on May 17, 1829\n* **William Cushing** (1789–1810), Associate Justice, died on September 13, 1810\n* **James Wilson** (1789–1798), Associate Justice, died on August 21, 1798\n* **Oliver Ellsworth** (1796–1800), Chief Justice, died on November 26, 1807\n\n### 1870–1919\n\n* **David Josiah Brewer** (1889–1910), Associate Justice, died on March 28, 1910\n* **Stephen J.

The protests were characterized by massive crowds gathering in major cities, including Colombo, the capital, and Galle Face, a large public space in Colombo.\n\n**Background**\n\nSri Lanka was facing a severe economic crisis, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. The country's foreign exchange reserves were depleted, leading to shortages of essential goods, including food, medicine, and fuel. The crisis was compounded by the government's decision to ban chemical fertilizers, which led to a collapse in agricultural production. The economic situation had been deteriorating for months, with widespread power cuts, shortages of essential goods, and a decline in living standards.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### **March**\n\nThe protests began in early March, with small gatherings of people in Colombo and other cities. The initial protests were peaceful, with demonstrators calling for the government to take action to resolve the economic crisis. As the protests grew, they became more widespread and intense, with larger crowds gathering in major cities.\n\n### **April**\n\nIn April, the protests escalated, with the declaration of a state of emergency on 1 April. The government claimed that the emergency was necessary to maintain order and prevent violence. However, the declaration was widely seen as an attempt to suppress the protests and silence the opposition.\n\n#### **Declaration of state of emergency**\n\nOn 1 April, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa declared a state of emergency, citing the need to maintain law and order. The emergency gave the government sweeping powers to arrest and detain individuals without charge. The declaration was widely criticized by human rights groups and opposition parties, who saw it as an attempt to suppress the protests and silence dissent.\n\n#### **Social media blocks**\n\nIn an effort to suppress the protests, the government blocked social media platforms, including Facebook and Twitter, on 3 April. The move was widely criticized, with opposition parties and human rights groups accusing the government of attempting to silence the opposition. The block was later lifted, but not before it had caused significant disruptions to online communication and social media platforms.\n\n#### **Cabinet resignation**\n\nOn 4 April, the entire cabinet resigned, in an effort to placate the protesters. However, the resignation was seen as too little, too late, and the protests continued to grow.\n\n#### **Reconvening of Parliament**\n\nOn 5 April, Parliament was reconvened, with opposition parties calling for the government to take action to resolve the economic crisis. However, the government's response was seen as inadequate, and the protests continued.\n\n#### **\"Occupy Galle Face\"**\n\nOn 9 April, a massive crowd gathered in Galle Face, a large public space in Colombo. The crowd, which was estimated to be over 100,000 strong, occupied the space and refused to leave. The event became known as \"Occupy Galle Face\" and marked a turning point in the protests.\n\n#### **Mynagogama**\n\nOn 11 April, a group of protesters gathered at Mynagogama, a town in the north of the country. The crowd, which was estimated to be over 20,000 strong, demanded that the government take action to resolve the economic crisis. The event was marked by clashes between protesters and security forces, with several injuries reported.\n\n#### **19 April: Rambukkana incident**\n\nOn 19 April, a group of protesters clashed with security forces in Rambukkana, a town in the central province. The incident was marked by several injuries and arrests, and was widely criticized by human rights groups.\n\n#### **28 April: Island-wide token strike**\n\nOn 28 April, an island-wide token strike was called, with thousands of workers participating. The strike was called in response to the government's failure to take action to resolve the economic crisis.\n\n### **May**\n\nIn May, the protests continued to grow, with the formation of new protest groups and the escalation of violence.\n\n#### **HoruGoGama protests**\n\nOn 2 May, a massive crowd gathered at HoruGoGama, a protest site in Galle Face. The crowd, which was estimated to be over 50,000 strong, demanded that the government take action to resolve the economic crisis. The event was marked by clashes between protesters and security forces, with several injuries reported.\n\n#### **Black Monday attacks on protesters**\n\nOn 9 May, a group of attackers targeted protesters in Galle Face, injuring several people. The incident was widely condemned by human rights groups and opposition parties.\n\n#### **Resignation of Mahinda Rajapaksa**\n\nOn 9 May, Mahinda Rajapaksa, the President's brother and a key ally, resigned as Prime Minister. The resignation was seen as a significant blow to the government.\n\n#### **Deployment of military**\n\nOn 10 May, the military was deployed to Galle Face, in an effort to quell the protests. The move was widely criticized by human rights groups and opposition parties.\n\n#### **Founding of No-Deal-Gama**\n\nOn 12 May, a new protest group, No-Deal-Gama, was founded. The group, which was made up of several opposition parties and civil society organizations, called for the government to take action to resolve the economic crisis.\n\n### **June**\n\nIn June, the protests continued to grow, with the government facing increasing pressure to take action.\n\n### **July**\n\nIn July, the protests reached a turning point, with the storming of the President's House and the resignation of President Rajapaksa.\n\n#### **9 July: Storming of President's House**\n\nOn 9 July, a massive crowd stormed the President's House, in an effort to remove President Rajapaksa from office. The incident was widely condemned by human rights groups and opposition parties.\n\n#### **13 July: Appointment of Acting President**\n\nOn 13 July, Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed as Acting President, following the resignation of President Rajapaksa. The appointment was seen as a significant development, with Wickremesinghe being a key opponent of President Rajapaksa.\n\n#### **14–15 July: President Rajapaksa's resignation**\n\nOn 14 July, President Rajapaksa resigned, following a no-confidence vote in Parliament. The resignation was seen as a significant blow to the government.\n\n#### **20–22 July: Under the new President, Galle Face raid**\n\nOn 20 July, a massive crowd gathered in Galle Face, in an effort to demand that the new President, Wickremesinghe, take action to resolve the economic crisis.

The project has been executed three times, with the first instance being in 2017 and the subsequent two in 2022 and 2023.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nR/place is a large-scale collaborative art project that allows users to contribute to a shared digital canvas in real-time. The project was first conceived by the Reddit community and was designed to be a dynamic and ever-changing artwork. Each instance of the project has been hosted on the Reddit platform, with users from around the world contributing to the artwork through a combination of collaborative effort and competition.\n\n**History**\n\n### 2017 experiment\n\nThe first R/place project was launched on April 1, 2017, as a temporary experiment on the Reddit platform. The project was designed to be a 1000x1000 pixel canvas, where users could contribute to the artwork by placing a single pixel at a time. The project was initially intended to run for only 36 hours but was extended to 72 hours due to its popularity. During this time, users from around the world contributed to the artwork, creating a complex and dynamic image.\n\nThe 2017 experiment was notable for the emergence of several distinct regions within the canvas, each with its own unique characteristics and themes. These regions were often created through the collaborative efforts of large groups of users, who worked together to create intricate designs and patterns. The project also attracted a significant amount of media attention, with many outlets covering the story of the collaborative artwork.\n\n### 2022 experiment\n\nThe second R/place project was launched on April 1, 2022, as a follow-up to the original experiment. The project was again hosted on the Reddit platform and featured a 1000x1000 pixel canvas, where users could contribute to the artwork in real-time. The 2022 experiment was notable for the increased complexity and diversity of the artwork, with users creating a wide range of designs and patterns.\n\nOne of the key features of the 2022 experiment was the emergence of several large-scale collaborative efforts, where groups of users worked together to create intricate and complex designs. These efforts often involved multiple users contributing to the artwork simultaneously, creating a dynamic and ever-changing image. The project also attracted a significant amount of media attention, with many outlets covering the story of the collaborative artwork.\n\n### 2023 experiment\n\nThe third R/place project was launched on April 1, 2023, as a follow-up to the previous two experiments. The project was again hosted on the Reddit platform and featured a 1000x1000 pixel canvas, where users could contribute to the artwork in real-time. The 2023 experiment was notable for the increased focus on competition and conflict, with users engaging in a series of large-scale battles and territorial disputes.\n\nOne of the key features of the 2023 experiment was the emergence of several large-scale \"nations\" within the canvas, each with its own unique culture and identity. These nations often engaged in wars and territorial disputes, creating a dynamic and ever-changing image. The project also attracted a significant amount of media attention, with many outlets covering the story of the collaborative artwork.\n\n**Media response**\n\nR/place has been covered by a wide range of media outlets, including news organizations, art publications, and technology websites. The project has been praised for its innovative approach to collaborative art and its ability to bring people together from around the world.\n\nMany outlets have noted the complexity and diversity of the artwork, with some describing it as a \" living, breathing entity\" that is constantly evolving and changing. Others have highlighted the social and cultural significance of the project, noting its ability to create a sense of community and shared identity among users.\n\nHowever, some outlets have also criticized the project for its lack of cohesion and its tendency to devolve into chaos and conflict. Others have noted the potential for harassment and bullying within the project, with some users engaging in behavior that is hostile or abusive.\n\n**Atlas**\n\nThe R/place atlas is a comprehensive guide to the different regions and territories within the canvas. The atlas includes a detailed map of the canvas, highlighting the different regions and their corresponding characteristics and themes.\n\nThe atlas also includes a series of case studies and essays that explore the social and cultural significance of the project. These essays examine the ways in which users interact with the canvas, creating complex and dynamic images that reflect their individual and collective identities.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Collaborative art\n* Digital art\n* Reddit\n* Pixel art\n\n**External links**\n\n* R/place (official project website)\n* Reddit (official project subreddit)\n* Atlas (comprehensive guide to the R/place canvas)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"R/place\" following this outline:\n\n#Overview\n#History\n##2017 experiment\n##2022 experiment\n##2023 experiment\n#Media response\n#Atlas\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is the fourth installment in the DC Extended Universe and the second solo outing of the Batman franchise following Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). The film revolves around the character of Bruce Wayne, also known as Batman, played by Robert Pattinson, as he navigates the complexities of Gotham City and confronts the villainous Riddler, played by Paul Dano.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film follows the story of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy philanthropist who has dedicated his life to protecting the citizens of Gotham City from crime and corruption. After the murder of his butler, Alfred Pennyworth, by the Riddler, Bruce's crusade takes a darker turn as he becomes increasingly obsessed with finding the killer. As the body count rises, Bruce's investigation leads him to uncover a web of deceit and corruption that goes all the way to the top of the city's elite.\n\nMeanwhile, a new villain emerges in the form of the Riddler, a brilliant and deranged individual who is obsessed with revenge against the city and its inhabitants. The Riddler's plan is to kill the citizens of Gotham and leave clues for Batman to solve, all while taunting him with his intelligence and cunning.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Bruce's relationships with his allies, including Commissioner James Gordon and Lucius Fox, are put to the test as he becomes increasingly isolated and consumed by his mission to stop the Riddler. The film culminates in a thrilling showdown between Batman and the Riddler, with the fate of Gotham City hanging in the balance.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne / Batman\n* Paul Dano as Edward Nashton / The Riddler\n* Zoë Kravitz as Selina Kyle / Catwoman\n* Jeffrey Wright as James Gordon\n* John Turturro as Carmine Falcone\n* Peter Sarsgaard as Gil Colson\n* Jayme Lawson as Bella Reál\n* Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobblepot / The Penguin\n\n**Production**\n\n#### Development\n\nThe film was initially conceived by Ben Affleck, who was set to direct and star in the film. Affleck's vision for the film was to create a more grounded and realistic take on the character of Batman, with a focus on the character's emotional and psychological struggles. However, Affleck ultimately stepped down as director and star, and the project was redeveloped under Matt Reeves.\n\nReeves' vision for the film was to create a more atmospheric and suspenseful take on the character of Batman, with a focus on the character's relationships with the people of Gotham City. Reeves also brought a new level of depth and complexity to the character of Bruce Wayne, exploring his emotional and psychological struggles in greater detail.\n\n#### Writing\n\nThe screenplay for the film was written by Matt Reeves and Chris Terrio, with Reeves serving as the primary writer. The script was heavily influenced by Reeves' own personal experiences and interests, including his love of noir fiction and his fascination with the character of Batman.\n\nThe screenplay was also influenced by the work of other writers, including Alan Moorhead and Jean-Paul Gaultier, who wrote the screenplays for the 1966 film Batman and the 1989 film Batman, respectively. The script was also influenced by the work of comic book writers, including Frank Miller and Neil Gaiman, who wrote the graphic novels Batman: Year One and Batman: The Killing Joke, respectively.\n\n#### Casting\n\nThe casting process for the film was a lengthy and rigorous process, with Reeves and his team holding auditions for the lead roles over several months. Robert Pattinson was ultimately cast as Bruce Wayne / Batman, with Paul Dano cast as Edward Nashton / The Riddler.\n\nZoë Kravitz was also cast in the film, playing the role of Selina Kyle / Catwoman. Kravitz's performance in the film was widely praised, with many critics noting her chemistry with Pattinson and her ability to bring a sense of depth and complexity to the character.\n\n#### Design\n\nThe design process for the film was a collaborative effort between Reeves, his production designer, Nathan Crowley, and the film's costume designer, Jacqueline Durran. The team worked closely together to create a visual aesthetic that was both grounded and fantastical, drawing inspiration from a wide range of sources, including film noir, comic books, and mythology.\n\nThe sets and props for the film were designed to be highly detailed and realistic, with a focus on creating a sense of immersion and authenticity.

Jackson Women's Health Organization**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nDobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization is a landmark United States Supreme Court case that has significant implications for reproductive rights and access to abortion in the country. The case originated in Mississippi, where a state law prohibited abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, except in cases of medical emergency. The Supreme Court's decision in June 2022 effectively overturned the landmark case of Roe v. Wade (1973), which had established a woman's constitutional right to abortion.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Common Law\n\nIn the United States, the common law tradition has long recognized the right to life as a fundamental human right. However, the common law also recognized that this right was not absolute and that it could be limited in certain circumstances. Prior to the 19th century, abortion was generally considered a crime, but it was not until the mid-19th century that states began to enact laws regulating or prohibiting abortion.\n\n### Constitutional Right\n\nThe concept of a constitutional right to abortion was first established in the 1973 case of Roe v. Wade. In that case, the Supreme Court held that a woman's right to choose an abortion was a fundamental right protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court's decision in Roe v. Wade established a trimester system for regulating abortion, which allowed for more restrictive laws during the third trimester.\n\n### Evolution of the Composition of the Supreme Court\n\nThe Supreme Court's composition has undergone significant changes over the years, which have had a profound impact on the country's laws and policies. The court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization reflects the changing views of the country's highest court on issues of reproductive rights and access to abortion.\n\n**Gestational Age Act**\n\n### Lower Courts\n\nThe Gestational Age Act, also known as House Bill 1510, was a state law enacted in Mississippi in 2018 that prohibited abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, except in cases of medical emergency. The law was challenged in federal court by Jackson Women's Health Organization, a clinic that provided abortion services in Mississippi. A district court judge blocked the law from going into effect, but an appeals court reversed the decision, allowing the law to take effect.\n\n**Supreme Court**\n\n### Oral Argument\n\nThe Supreme Court heard oral argument in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization on December 1, 2021. During the argument, the justices engaged in a lively debate about the constitutionality of the Gestational Age Act and the implications of the court's decision for reproductive rights and access to abortion.\n\n### Leaked Draft Opinion\n\nA leaked draft opinion of the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization was published in the media in May 2022. The leaked opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, indicated that the court would overturn Roe v. Wade and allow states to regulate or prohibit abortion as they saw fit.\n\n### Reactions\n\nThe leaked draft opinion sparked widespread outrage and protests across the country. Many women's rights organizations and advocacy groups condemned the proposed decision, while some conservative groups and politicians celebrated it as a victory for the pro-life movement.\n\n### Investigation\n\nThe leak of the draft opinion was investigated by the Supreme Court's Marshal, who is responsible for ensuring the integrity and security of the court's proceedings. The investigation was led by a retired FBI agent, who reviewed the court's security protocols and identified the individual responsible for the leak.\n\n**Opinions**\n\n### Majority Opinion\n\nThe Supreme Court's majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, written by Justice Samuel Alito, effectively overturned the landmark case of Roe v. Wade. The opinion held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not protect a woman's right to abortion, and that the right to abortion was not a fundamental right protected by the Constitution.\n\n### Concurrences\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett joined Justice Alito's majority opinion in full. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.\n\n### Concurrence in Judgment\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh wrote a concurrence in judgment, which agreed with the majority opinion but disagreed with the reasoning. Justice Kavanaugh argued that the Due Process Clause did not protect a woman's right to abortion, but that the right to abortion was a matter of state law.\n\n### Dissent\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer wrote a dissenting opinion, which argued that the majority opinion was a significant setback for women's rights and reproductive freedom. Justice Breyer argued that the Due Process Clause protected a woman's right to abortion, and that the court's decision would have far-reaching consequences for women's health and well-being.\n\n**Impact**\n\n### Pre-decision\n\nPrior to the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, many states had enacted laws restricting access to abortion. These laws included requirements for parental consent, gestational age limits, and waiting periods. The Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization effectively allowed these laws to take effect, restricting access to abortion in many states.\n\n### Post-decision\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has had significant consequences for women's reproductive rights and access to abortion. Many states have enacted laws restricting or prohibiting abortion, while others have expanded access to abortion services. The decision has also sparked widespread protests and activism, with many women's rights organizations and advocacy groups calling for greater protections for reproductive freedom.\n\n### State Laws Restricting Abortion\n\nSince the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, many states have enacted laws restricting access to abortion. These laws include requirements for parental consent, gestational age limits, and waiting periods. Some states have also banned abortion altogether, while others have restricted access to abortion services.\n\n#### EMTALA and Federal Preemption\n\nThe Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires hospitals to provide emergency medical treatment, including abortion services, to patients in medical emergencies. However, some states have argued that EMTALA does not require hospitals to provide abortion services, and that the federal preemption doctrine allows states to regulate or prohibit abortion as they see fit.\n\n### State Laws Expanding Abortion Access\n\nSome states have enacted laws expanding access to abortion services. These laws include repealing restrictions on abortion, expanding funding for abortion services, and protecting access to abortion services in the face of federal or state restrictions.\n\n### Congressional Proposals\n\nCongress has proposed several bills to protect access to abortion services, including the Women's Health Protection Act and the Protecting Access to Preventive Services Act. These bills aim to codify the right to abortion and protect access to abortion services in the face of federal or state restrictions.\n\n### Executive Action by President Biden\n\nPresident Biden has taken executive action to protect access to abortion services, including rescinding the Mexico City Policy and expanding funding for abortion services abroad. The President has also called on Congress to pass legislation protecting access to abortion services.\n\n### Medical Abortion, In Vitro Fertilization, and Other Processes\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has significant implications for medical abortion, in vitro fertilization, and other reproductive health technologies. Many of these technologies, including abortion pills and fertility treatments, are now at risk of being restricted or prohibited by state laws.\n\n### Data Privacy\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has significant implications for data privacy and reproductive health. Many reproductive health apps and online platforms are now at risk of being restricted or prohibited by state laws, which could compromise the confidentiality and security of reproductive health data.\n\n### 2022 and 2024 United States Election Seasons\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has significant implications for the 2022 and 2024 United States election seasons. Many women's rights organizations and advocacy groups are mobilizing to protect access to abortion services and reproductive freedom, while many pro-life groups and politicians are seeking to restrict access to abortion services.\n\n### Effects on Abortion Rates\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has significant implications for abortion rates. Many states have enacted laws restricting access to abortion, which could lead to an increase in abortion rates. However, other states have expanded access to abortion services, which could lead to a decrease in abortion rates.\n\n### Effects on Infant Mortality\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has significant implications for infant mortality rates. Many states have enacted laws restricting access to abortion, which could lead to an increase in infant mortality rates. However, other states have expanded access to abortion services, which could lead to a decrease in infant mortality rates.\n\n**Reaction**\n\n### Legal Journalists\n\nLegal journalists have been closely following the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v.

The match was a unique and groundbreaking event that brought together two teams of Australian soldiers, the Third Australian Divisional Squad and the Australian Training Units Squad, in a display of camaraderie and sporting spirit during a time of war.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe 1916 Pioneer Exhibition Game was a remarkable event that showcased the determination and resilience of Australian soldiers during World War I. The match was conceived by Sir John Monash, the Commander of the Third Australian Division, who believed that sport could play a vital role in boosting morale and promoting esprit de corps among Australian troops. The game was a precursor to the modern-day AFL exhibition matches, and its significance extends beyond the sporting arena, highlighting the importance of community and teamwork during times of conflict.\n\n**Origin**\n\n**Monash's views on the value of sport**\n\nSir John Monash, a highly respected military leader and sports enthusiast, was instrumental in organizing the 1916 Pioneer Exhibition Game. Monash believed that sport had the power to bring people together, foster teamwork, and promote a sense of belonging. He saw the game as an opportunity to boost morale among Australian soldiers and to provide a much-needed distraction from the harsh realities of war. Monash's vision for the game was to create an event that would be memorable, enjoyable, and inspiring for all involved.\n\n**Planning**\n\n**Participants**\n\nThe two teams participating in the match were the Third Australian Divisional Squad and the Australian Training Units Squad. Both teams were comprised of Australian soldiers from various backgrounds and units. The teams were selected based on their skills, fitness, and availability, with many players being experienced sportsmen before enlisting for military service.

The protests began as a response to the Canadian government's COVID-19 vaccine mandates and passports, but they quickly evolved into a broader movement against government policies and regulations.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Protest Goals\n\nThe primary goal of the protest was to oppose the Canadian government's vaccine mandates and passports, which were introduced to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The protesters also sought to demand the removal of the mandates and to restore individual freedoms.\n\n### Initial Events and the Start of the Protest\n\nThe protest began on January 22, 2022, when a group of truckers and supporters gathered in Ottawa, the capital city of Canada. The event was organized by the Canadian Trucking Alliance, a trade organization that represents the interests of trucking companies and drivers. The protest was initially intended to be a small, peaceful event, but it quickly gained momentum and grew into a massive demonstration.\n\n### American Influence\n\nThe protest was also influenced by American politics and social movements. Many of the protesters were inspired by the January 6, 2021, storming of the United States Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump. Some protesters also drew parallels between the Canadian government's COVID-19 policies and the perceived overreach of the U.S. government.\n\n### Fundraising\n\nThe protest was largely funded through online donations, which were collected through various crowdfunding platforms. The funds were used to support the protesters, including providing food, shelter, and fuel for the truckers. The fundraising effort was highly successful, with millions of dollars being raised in a matter of days.\n\n### Donor List Hacked\n\nIn the midst of the fundraising effort, the donor list was hacked, and sensitive information was leaked online. The hacking incident was widely condemned, and an investigation was launched to identify the perpetrator.\n\n### Vaccine Mandates and Passports\n\nThe Canadian government introduced vaccine mandates and passports as a measure to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The mandates required individuals to be fully vaccinated in order to participate in certain activities, such as traveling, attending public events, or working in certain industries. The passports, which were introduced in November 2021, allowed vaccinated individuals to travel across the country without being subject to testing or quarantine requirements.\n\n### Vaccination Requirements for US–Canada Cross-Border Travel\n\nIn November 2021, the Canadian government introduced vaccination requirements for US–Canada cross-border travel. The requirements stipulated that all travelers arriving in Canada from the United States must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, unless they were exempt due to medical or other reasons.\n\n**Convoy to Ottawa**\n\nThe convoy to Ottawa was a key aspect of the protest. A group of truckers and supporters drove their vehicles to the capital city, where they participated in a massive demonstration on Parliament Hill. The convoy was organized through social media and was largely self-financed.\n\n**Ottawa Protest**\n\nThe Ottawa protest was a massive demonstration that took place on Parliament Hill in February 2022.

The demonstration was one of the largest in Canadian history, and it drew attention from around the world.\n\n### Desecration and Community Harassment\n\nDuring the protest, some individuals and groups desecrated public property and harassed community members. The incidents were widely condemned, and an investigation was launched to identify the perpetrators.\n\n### Ottawa Protests and Entrenchment\n\nThe Ottawa protests and entrenchment were a series of events that took place in February and March 2022.

The city's businesses and residents suffered significant losses due to the disruptions caused by the protests.\n\n**Major Blockades**\n\nThe protests also led to major blockades at several border crossings between Canada and the United States.\n\n### Alberta–Montana\n\nThe Alberta–Montana border crossing was one of the most significant blockades, with truckers and protesters occupying the crossing for several days.

The groups were united in their opposition to government policies and regulations.\n\n### Counter-Protests\n\nThe protest was also met with counter-protests, which were organized by groups such as the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and the Canadian Labour Congress. The counter-protests were largely peaceful, but they were met with resistance from some protesters.\n\n### Ottawa Police Service Response\n\nThe Ottawa Police Service responded to the protest with a heavy-handed approach, using tear gas and pepper spray to disperse the crowds.

The centre brought together representatives from various agencies, including the police, fire, and emergency medical services, to coordinate their responses.\n\n### Clearance\n\nThe clearance of the protest was a complex process that involved several agencies and stakeholders. The process was led by the Integrated Command Centre, which worked closely with the police and other agencies to ensure a safe and peaceful resolution.\n\n### Municipal Response\n\nThe municipal response to the protest was led by the City of Ottawa, which worked closely with the police and other agencies to ensure a safe and peaceful resolution.\n\n### Provincial Response\n\nThe provincial response to the protest was led by the Government of Ontario, which worked closely with the city and other agencies to ensure a safe and peaceful resolution.\n\n### Federal Response\n\nThe federal response to the protest was led by the Government of Canada, which invoked the Emergencies Act to address the situation.\n\n### Emergencies Act\n\nThe Emergencies Act allows the federal government to take extraordinary measures to address emergencies, including the invocation of martial law.
