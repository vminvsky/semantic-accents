From its indigenous peoples to its current status as a modern democracy, Taiwan's history is marked by numerous periods of colonization, rebellion, and transformation.\n\n**Prehistory**\n\nThe earliest inhabitants of Taiwan were the indigenous peoples, who arrived on the island around 10,000 years ago. These early settlers developed a complex society with their own distinct cultures, languages, and traditions. The indigenous peoples of Taiwan were skilled farmers, hunters, and gatherers, and they developed a rich spiritual and cultural heritage.\n\nThe earliest known evidence of human habitation in Taiwan dates back to the Late Pleistocene era, with the discovery of fossils and artifacts from the Wushe and Nanyuan archaeological sites. The indigenous peoples of Taiwan were organized into several distinct tribes, each with their own language, culture, and traditions.\n\n**Chinese contact and settlement**\n\nThe first recorded contact between the indigenous peoples of Taiwan and the Chinese was during the Han Dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE). Chinese traders and fishermen began to arrive on the island, and they introduced new technologies, crops, and ideas to the indigenous population. The indigenous peoples of Taiwan were initially resistant to Chinese influence, but over time, they began to adopt Chinese customs and practices.\n\nDuring the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE), the Chinese government began to take a more active interest in Taiwan, and they established trade relations with the island. The indigenous peoples of Taiwan were subjected to Chinese rule, and they were forced to adopt Chinese customs and practices. This marked the beginning of a long period of Chinese domination over Taiwan.\n\n**Dutch and Spanish colonies (1624–1668)**\n\n### Contact and establishment\n\nIn the early 17th century, the Dutch East India Company established a trading post on the island of Taiwan.

It is the world's third-largest country by both area and population. The country is situated in North America, bordered by Canada to the north and Mexico to the south.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"United States\" comes from the 13 British colonies that declared independence in 1776 and formed the United States of America. The name was chosen to reflect the unity and independence of the newly formed nation.\n\n**History**\n\n### Indigenous peoples\n\nThe first human habitation in what is now the United States dates back to the arrival of Native American populations around 15,000 years ago. These indigenous peoples developed complex societies and cultures, with various tribes speaking different languages and practicing distinct traditions.\n\n### European settlement and conflict (1607–1765)\n\nIn 1607, the first permanent English settlement was established at Jamestown, Virginia. Other European colonizers, including the Spanish, French, and Dutch, also settled in the region, leading to conflicts over land and resources. The British colonies expanded and developed, with the founding of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1629 and the establishment of the Pennsylvania Colony by William Penn in 1682.\n\n### American Revolution and the early republic (1765–1800)\n\nThe American Revolution began in 1775 with the Battles of Lexington and Concord, where American colonists clashed with British soldiers. The Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776, marking the formal declaration of independence from Great Britain. The new nation fought for its existence throughout the Revolutionary War, ultimately securing its independence with the Treaty of Paris in 1783. The United States Constitution was ratified in 1788, establishing the framework for the federal government and the system of governance.\n\n### Westward expansion and Civil War (1800–1865)\n\nThe Louisiana Purchase of 1803 doubled the size of the United States, and the Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804-1806) explored the newly acquired territory. The Mexican-American War (1846-1848) resulted in the U.S. gaining control of a significant amount of land, including present-day California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and parts of Colorado, Utah, Nevada, and Wyoming. The American Civil War (1861-1865) was fought between the Union (the northern states) and the Confederacy (the southern states) over issues of slavery and states' rights. The Union ultimately prevailed, but not before the deaths of an estimated 620,000 to 750,000 soldiers.\n\n### Post–Civil War era (1865–1917)\n\nThe Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) saw the passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution, which abolished slavery, granted citizenship to African American men, and protected their right to vote. The Gilded Age (1870s-1890s) was marked by rapid economic growth, industrialization, and immigration. The Spanish-American War (1898) led to the U.S. gaining control of several territories, including Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines.\n\n### Rise as a superpower (1917–1945)\n\nThe United States entered World War I in 1917, and its contribution to the Allied victory helped establish it as a major world power. The Roaring Twenties (1920s) were marked by significant cultural and economic changes, including the rise of jazz, the Harlem Renaissance, and the growth of the automobile industry. The Great Depression (1929-1939) was a severe economic downturn that lasted over a decade. The United States played a key role in World War II, contributing to the Allied victory and emerging as one of the world's two superpowers alongside the Soviet Union.\n\n### Cold War (1945–1991)\n\nThe Cold War was a period of ideological and strategic competition between the United States and the Soviet Union, marked by proxy wars, espionage, and nuclear deterrence. The Korean War (1950-1953) and the Vietnam War (1955-1975) were two significant conflicts fought during this period. The Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s led to significant advances in racial equality, including the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\n### Contemporary (1991–present)\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked the end of the Cold War, and the United States emerged as the world's sole superpower. The Gulf War (1990-1991) and the War in Afghanistan (2001-present) were two significant conflicts fought during this period. The September 11 attacks (2001) led to the War on Terror, which has seen the U.S. involved in various military interventions and counterterrorism operations around the world.\n\n**Geography**\n\n### Climate\n\nThe United States has a diverse climate, ranging from tropical in Hawaii and southern Florida to polar in Alaska. The continental United States has a temperate climate, with cold winters and hot summers. The average temperature varies greatly depending on the region, with the coldest temperatures found in the northern states and the warmest temperatures found in the southern states.\n\n### Biodiversity and conservation\n\nThe United States is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, with various ecosystems, including forests, grasslands, deserts, and wetlands. The country has a rich biodiversity, with over 500 species of mammals, 800 species of birds, and 30,000 species of plants. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 protects threatened and endangered species, and the National Park Service manages over 400 national parks and monuments.\n\n**Government and politics**\n\n### National government\n\nThe United States has a federal system of government, with three branches: the legislative (Congress), the executive (the President), and the judicial (the Supreme Court). The President is both the head of state and the head of government, and is elected by the people through the Electoral College. Congress is composed of the Senate and the House of Representatives, with the Senate having equal representation from each state and the House having representation based on population.\n\n### Political parties\n\nThe two major political parties in the United States are the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. The Democratic Party generally leans towards liberal or progressive policies, while the Republican Party leans towards conservative policies. Other notable parties include the Libertarian Party and the Green Party.\n\n### Subdivisions\n\nThe United States is divided into 50 states, each with its own government and laws. The District of Columbia is a federal district that serves as the capital of the United States. The states are further divided into counties, cities, and towns, with each level of government having its own powers and responsibilities.\n\n### Foreign relations\n\nThe United States has diplomatic relations with over 180 countries, and is a member of various international organizations, including the United Nations, the G20, and the NATO.

The FBI is the primary federal law enforcement agency, while the Department of Homeland Security plays a key role in national security and counterterrorism. The court system is divided into federal and state courts, with the Supreme Court serving as the highest court in the land.\n\n**Economy**\n\n### Science, technology, spaceflight and energy\n\nThe United States has a strong focus on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and research, with many top-ranked universities and research institutions. The country has a significant presence in the fields of space exploration, with NASA being a major player in the international space community. The energy sector is dominated by fossil fuels, but there is a growing focus on renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power.\n\n### Transportation\n\nThe United States has a well-developed transportation system, with a network of roads, highways, and airports.

Wade, a landmark Supreme Court decision that guaranteed a woman's right to an abortion. The protests have continued into 2024, with various groups and individuals advocating for reproductive rights and access to abortion services.\n\nBackground\n\n### Leaked Draft Opinion\n\nIn May 2022, a draft opinion written by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito was leaked to the press, indicating that the Court was poised to overturn Roe v. Wade. The draft opinion, which was later confirmed as the majority opinion in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, argued that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion and that the issue should be left to the states.\n\n### Overturning of Roe v. Wade\n\nOn June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, effectively overturning Roe v. Wade. The decision was met with widespread protests and demonstrations across the United States, as well as internationally.\n\nProtests Before the Ruling\n\n### Midwest\n\nBefore the ruling, protests and demonstrations were already taking place in the Midwest, particularly in states with restrictive abortion laws.\n\n*   In Illinois, which has some of the most permissive abortion laws in the country, pro-choice activists organized rallies and protests in support of Roe v.

Wade.\n\n### West\n\n#### California\n\nIn California, which has some of the most permissive abortion laws in the country, pro-choice activists organized rallies and protests in support of Roe v. Wade.\n\nOutside the United States\n\nProtests and demonstrations were also held outside the United States, particularly in Canada and Europe, where many countries have more permissive abortion laws.\n\nWomen's March\n\nOn January 21, 2023, thousands of people gathered for the Women's March, a global protest and demonstration that took place in cities across the United States and internationally. The march was organized in response to the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the subsequent restrictions on access to abortion services.\n\nResponse\n\n### About Protests Outside Private Homes\n\nIn response to the protests and demonstrations, some private citizens took to social media to express their opposition to the protests, stating that they were taking place outside private homes. However, many pro-choice activists argued that the protests were taking place outside public spaces, such as sidewalks and streets, and that they had the right to protest and express themselves.\n\nProtests After the Ruling\n\n### 2022\n\nIn the aftermath of the ruling, protests and demonstrations continued to take place across the United States.\n\n*   In the Midwest, protests were held in cities such as Chicago, Illinois; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Detroit, Michigan.\n*   In the Northeast, protests were held in cities such as New York City, Boston, Massachusetts; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n*   In the South, protests were held in cities such as Atlanta, Georgia; Nashville, Tennessee; and Austin, Texas.\n*   In the West, protests were held in cities such as Los Angeles, California; San Francisco, California; and Seattle, Washington.\n\n### 2023\n\nIn 2023, protests and demonstrations continued to take place across the United States.\n\n*   In the Midwest, protests were held in cities such as Chicago, Illinois; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Detroit, Michigan.\n*   In the Northeast, protests were held in cities such as New York City, Boston, Massachusetts; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n*   In the South, protests were held in cities such as Atlanta, Georgia; Nashville, Tennessee; and Austin, Texas.\n*   In the West, protests were held in cities such as Los Angeles, California; San Francisco, California; and Seattle, Washington.\n\n### 2024\n\nIn 2024, protests and demonstrations continued to take place across the United States.\n\n*   In the Midwest, protests were held in cities such as Chicago, Illinois; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Detroit, Michigan.\n*   In the Northeast, protests were held in cities such as New York City, Boston, Massachusetts; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n*   In the South, protests were held in cities such as Atlanta, Georgia; Nashville, Tennessee; and Austin, Texas.\n*   In the West, protests were held in cities such as Los Angeles, California; San Francisco, California; and Seattle, Washington.\n\n### Arizona\n\n#### 2022\n\nIn Arizona, protests were held in cities such as Phoenix and Tucson.\n\n#### 2024\n\nIn Arizona, protests were held in cities such as Phoenix and Tucson.\n\nOutside the United States\n\nProtests and demonstrations continued to take place outside the United States, particularly in Canada and Europe, where many countries have more permissive abortion laws.\n\nSee also\n\n*   Abortion in the United States\n*   Dobbs v.

Born in the village of Domremy in northeastern France, Joan is known for her military campaigns, her trial, and her eventual execution as a heretic. In 1920, she was declared a martyr and in 1922 was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church. Her legacy as a military leader and a symbol of French nationalism has endured for centuries, and she remains one of the most revered figures in French history.\n\n**Birth and historical background**\n\nThe Hundred Years' War, a dynastic struggle between the kingdoms of England and France, had been raging for nearly a century when Joan of Arc was born. In 1340, the English king Edward III had claimed the French throne, citing his descent from the French king Philip IV through his mother, Isabella of France. This led to a series of conflicts between the two nations, with the English ultimately controlling large portions of French territory.\n\nJoan's family lived in the village of Domremy, situated in the northeastern region of France known as Lorraine. Her father, Jacques Arc, was a peasant farmer, and her mother, Isabelle Romée, managed the household. Joan's early life was marked by frequent conflicts between Catholics and the French nobility, who were largely sympathetic to the English cause.\n\n**Early life**\n\nJoan was born on January 6, 1412, in Domremy, where she spent her early years surrounded by the rolling hills and forests of the Lorraine countryside. She was the youngest of three children, and her family lived in a small farmhouse on the outskirts of the village. The village was largely Catholic, and the villagers were known for their piety and devotion to the Church.\n\nAs a child, Joan was deeply influenced by the Catholic Church and its teachings. She attended church regularly, and her mother encouraged her to develop a strong faith. Joan's visions of God and the saints, which began when she was around 13 years old, are said to have been a source of comfort and guidance for her throughout her life.\n\n**Chinon**\n\nIn 1429, at the age of 17, Joan arrived at the city of Chinon, which was the seat of the French royal court. She had been summoned by Charles VII, the French king, who was seeking a way to end the English occupation of France. Joan had been experiencing a series of visions and hearings from God, which she believed instructed her to drive the English out of France and to crown the king as the rightful ruler of France.\n\nCharles VII was initially skeptical of Joan's claims, but after meeting with her, he became convinced of her sincerity and her divine mission. He appointed her as the leader of his army, which was assembled in the city of Orléans, a key stronghold of the French resistance.\n\n**Military campaigns**\n\nJoan's military campaigns were marked by several key victories, which helped to shift the momentum of the war in favor of the French. The following sections outline the key events of her campaigns.\n\n### **Orléans**\n\nIn May 1429, Joan arrived at the city of Orléans, which was under siege by the English. The city's defenders were on the brink of surrender, but Joan's arrival and her words of encouragement helped to boost their morale. She led the French army to a series of victories, including the capture of the Tourelles fortress and the defeat of the English at the Battle of Les Tourelles.\n\n### **Loire Campaign**\n\nIn July 1429, Joan led the French army on a campaign along the Loire River, where they scored a series of victories against the English. The campaign was marked by the capture of several key cities, including the city of Tours and the town of Blois.\n\n### **Coronation and siege of Paris**\n\nIn December 1429, Joan led the French army to the city of Paris, which was under siege by the English. However, the city's defenses were too strong, and the French were unable to break through. Despite this, Joan's presence helped to boost the morale of the Parisians, and the city remained in French hands.\n\n### **Campaign against Perrinet Gressart**\n\nIn 1430, Joan led the French army on a campaign against Perrinet Gressart, a French nobleman who had defected to the English side. The campaign was marked by a series of victories, including the capture of Gressart's stronghold and the defeat of his army.\n\n### **Siege of Compiègne and capture**\n\nIn May 1430, Joan led the French army to the city of Compiègne, which was under siege by the English. However, the city's defenses were too strong, and the French were unable to break through. As Joan was attempting to cross the city's moat, she was captured by the Burgundians, who were allies of the English.\n\n**Trials and execution**\n\nJoan's capture marked the beginning of a series of trials, which ultimately led to her execution as a heretic. The following sections outline the key events of her trials and execution.\n\n### **Trial**\n\nJoan's trial was conducted by the Inquisitor Pierre Cauchon, who was appointed by the Bishop of Beauvais. The trial was marked by a series of interrogations and examinations, during which Joan was asked to provide details about her visions and her mission. However, Joan refused to cooperate, citing her loyalty to the French crown and her duty to God.\n\n### **Execution**\n\nOn May 30, 1431, Joan was executed by burning at the stake in the market square of Rouen. The execution was marked by a series of rituals, including the reading of the sentence and the pronouncement of her guilt.\n\n### **Aftermath and rehabilitation trial**\n\nIn 1456, a rehabilitation trial was conducted, which declared Joan's execution to be null and void. The trial was marked by a series of hearings and examinations, during which witnesses testified to Joan's innocence and her martyrdom.\n\n**Visions**\n\nJoan's visions were a central aspect of her life and her mission. She believed that she was instructed by God and the saints to drive the English out of France and to crown the king as the rightful ruler of France. Her visions were said to have been a source of comfort and guidance for her throughout her life.\n\n**Clothing**\n\nJoan's clothing was a subject of controversy during her trial. She was accused of wearing men's clothing, which was seen as a sign of her heresy. However, Joan argued that she wore men's clothing in order to disguise herself as a man, in accordance with her divine mission.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nJoan's legacy as a military leader and a symbol of French nationalism has endured for centuries. She remains one of the most revered figures in French history, and her story has inspired countless works of art and literature.\n\n### **Military leader and symbol of France**\n\nJoan's military campaigns and her victories helped to shift the momentum of the war in favor of the French. She remains a symbol of French resistance and determination, and her legacy continues to inspire generations of French people.\n\n### **Saint and heroic woman**\n\nJoan's canonization as a saint in 1922 marked a significant milestone in her legacy. She remains a revered figure in the Catholic Church, and her story has inspired countless works of art and literature. Her bravery and selflessness have made her a heroic figure, and her legacy continues to inspire people around the world.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Hundred Years' War\n* Charles VII of France\n* Pierre Cauchon\n* Rehabilitation trial of Joan of Arc\n\n**References**\n\nNote: This article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Joan of Arc's visions and hearings were said to have been a source of comfort and guidance for her throughout her life.\n* Her military campaigns and victories helped to shift the momentum of the war in favor of the French.\n* Her trial and execution were marked by a series of rituals and ceremonies.\n* Her rehabilitation trial declared her execution to be null and void.\n\n**Citations**\n\nNote: This article does not include any citations.\n\n**Sources**\n\nNote: This article is based on a variety of historical sources, including contemporary accounts and secondary sources.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Joan of Arc Museum (Rouen)\n* Joan of Arc Foundation (France)\n* Joan of Arc Society (United States)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Joan_of_Arc\" following this outline:\n\n#Name\n#Birth and historical background\n#Early life\n#Chinon\n#Military campaigns\n##Orléans\n##Loire Campaign\n##Coronation and siege of Paris\n##Campaign against Perrinet Gressart\n##Siege of Compiègne and capture\n#Trials and execution\n##Trial\n##Execution\n##Aftermath and rehabilitation trial\n#Visions\n#Clothing\n#Legacy\n##Military leader and symbol of France\n##Saint and heroic woman\n#See also\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The dynasty is said to have ruled over Iran before the Kayanian dynasty, and is associated with the Zoroastrian tradition. The Pishdadian dynasty is also mentioned in other ancient sources, including the Tarikh al-Rusul wa al-Muluk (History of the Prophets and Kings) by al-Tabari.\n\n**Origins, etymology and sources**\n\nThe origins of the Pishdadian dynasty are shrouded in myth and legend. The name \"Pishdadian\" is derived from the Old Persian word \"Pishdad,\" which means \"first-born\" or \"first-issued.\" The dynasty is mentioned in several ancient sources, including the Shahnameh, the Tarikh al-Rusul wa al-Muluk, and the Persian historian Firdawsi's work.\n\n**The Shahnameh and Zoroastrian tradition**\n\nThe Shahnameh, written by Ferdowsi in the 10th century, is the most authoritative source for the history of the Pishdadian dynasty. According to the Shahnameh, the Pishdadians were the first rulers of Iran, who established the foundations of the Persian Empire. The dynasty is said to have been founded by Pishdad, who was the first ruler of Iran and was born from the body of the sun god, Ahura Mazda.\n\n### Overview\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is said to have ruled over Iran for 600 years, during which time they established a strong and prosperous kingdom. The dynasty is associated with the Zoroastrian tradition, and its rulers were said to have been wise and just. The Pishdadians were also known for their military prowess, and their wars with neighboring tribes and kingdoms are legendary.\n\n### The kings\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is said to have had several kings, each with his own unique character and achievements. The most notable of these kings were:\n\n* Pishdad, the first ruler of Iran and the founder of the dynasty.\n* Jamshid, who expanded the empire and established a strong military.\n* Tur, who was a wise and just ruler, known for his great wisdom and kindness.\n* Fereydun, who was a brave warrior and a great leader.\n* Sam, who was a wise and just ruler, known for his great wisdom and kindness.\n* Iraj, who was a brave warrior and a great leader.\n* Manuchehr, who was a wise and just ruler, known for his great wisdom and kindness.\n* Jamasp, who was a brave warrior and a great leader.\n* Zarir, who was a wise and just ruler, known for his great wisdom and kindness.\n* Auzouhah, who was a brave warrior and a great leader.\n* Turak, who was the last ruler of the Pishdadian dynasty and the first ruler of the Kayanian dynasty.\n\n**Tabari and the Muslim narratives**\n\nThe Tarikh al-Rusul wa al-Muluk, written by al-Tabari in the 9th century, provides an alternative account of the Pishdadian dynasty. According to Tabari, the Pishdadian kings were the first rulers of Iran, who established a strong and prosperous kingdom. However, their reign was marked by conflict and strife, particularly with the Turks.\n\n### The first Pishdadian kings and the conflict with Iblis\n\nTabari's account begins with the story of the first Pishdadian king, Pishdad, who was said to have been born from the body of the sun god, Ahura Mazda. Pishdad's reign was marked by great wisdom and kindness, and he established a strong and prosperous kingdom. However, his reign was also marked by conflict with Iblis, a powerful and evil spirit who sought to destroy the kingdom.\n\n### From Jam al-Shidh to Zaw: al-Dahhak and war with the Turks\n\nTabari's account continues with the story of Jam al-Shidh, a Pishdadian king who expanded the empire and established a strong military. However, his reign was marked by conflict with the Turks, who sought to destroy the kingdom.

The debates will take place on a monthly basis, with the first debate scheduled to take place on March 15, 2023.\n\n**#Controversies**\n\n###Primary schedule\n\nThe Democratic Party's primary schedule has been criticized for being too long and drawn out. Some critics argue that the schedule allows too much time for candidates to drop out of the race, which could lead to a fragmented and disorganized primary process.\n\n###Ballot access denials\n\nSome candidates have been denied ballot access in certain states, which could limit their ability to compete in the primary. For example, some candidates have been denied ballot access in states where they do not meet the party's signature requirements.\n\n###Challengers having difficulties\n\nSome challengers have been having difficulties raising funds and building momentum in the primary. For example, some candidates have been struggling to gain traction in the polls and have been unable to raise sufficient funds to compete effectively in the primary.\n\n###Process following Biden's withdrawal\n\nIf Biden were to withdraw from the primary, the process would likely involve a series of debates and forums between the remaining candidates. The candidate with the most delegates would likely emerge as the front-runner, but the process would also involve a series of additional debates and forums to ensure that the remaining candidates have a fair opportunity to compete.\n\n**#Debates and forums**\n\nThe Democratic National Committee (DNC) has announced that the primary debates will be longer and more frequent than in previous cycles. The debates will take place on a monthly basis, with the first debate scheduled to take place on March 15, 2023.\n\n**#Endorsements**\n\nSome notable endorsements have been made by prominent Democrats and organizations. For example, former President Barack Obama has endorsed Joe Biden, while Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has endorsed Bernie Sanders.\n\n**#Opinion polling**\n\nOpinion polling has shown that the Democratic primary is highly competitive, with several candidates vying for the party's nomination. Some polls have shown that Joe Biden is leading in the polls, while others have shown that Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren are in the lead.\n\n**#Campaign finance**\n\nCampaign finance has been a major issue in the Democratic primary, with some candidates struggling to raise sufficient funds to compete effectively. Some candidates have been reliant on small donations, while others have received significant funding from wealthy donors.\n\n**#See also**\n\n* 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries\n* 2024 United States presidential election\n\n**#Notes**\n\n* The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is responsible for overseeing the primary and caucus process.\n* The Iowa caucuses are the first contest in the primary and caucus calendar.\n* Super Tuesday is a series of contests that take place on the same day, including the primaries in several Southern states.\n\n**#References**\n\nThis article has no references.\n\n**#External links**\n\n* Democratic National Committee (DNC) homepage\n* 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries at Ballotpedia", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2024_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries\" following this outline:\n\n#Pledged delegates by candidate following primaries\n#Results\n#Candidates\n##Nominee\n##Declined after the primaries\n##Withdrew after the primaries\n##Withdrew during the primaries\n###Other candidates\n##Withdrew before the primaries\n###Other candidates\n#Vice-presidential candidate selection\n#Primaries and caucus calendar\n#Ballot access\n#Timeline\n##2023\n###February 2023\n###March 2023\n###April 2023\n###June 2023\n###September 2023\n###October 2023\n###November 2023\n###December 2023\n##2024\n###January 2024\n###February 2024\n###March 2024\n###April 2024\n###May 2024\n###June 2024\n###July 2024\n###August 2024\n##Overview\n##Early developments\n##Format changes\n##Controversies\n###Primary schedule\n###Ballot access denials\n###Challengers having difficulties\n###Process following Biden's withdrawal\n#Debates and forums\n#Endorsements\n#Opinion polling\n#Campaign finance\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The operation was a significant reversal of fortunes for the Russian Army, which had previously made gains in the region.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Kharkiv counteroffensive was a major turning point in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which had begun in February 2022. Following a series of setbacks, including the withdrawal from Kyiv and the loss of the Snake Island, Russian forces had been pushing southwards along the Donets River. However, the bravery and resilience of the Ukrainian people, combined with the determination of their military, ultimately led to a major counterattack.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe city of Kharkiv had been under siege by Russian forces since February 2022, with frequent artillery bombardments and air attacks causing significant damage and loss of life. The surrounding region had also been heavily contested, with Ukrainian forces fighting to hold back the Russian advance. However, in late August 2022, Ukrainian military commanders began to plan a counteroffensive to retake lost territory and push Russian forces back.\n\n**Prelude**\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces had been gathering intelligence and preparing their positions. They had established a strong presence along the Oskil River, which formed the northern border of Kharkiv Oblast, and had built up significant stores of ammunition and supplies. Meanwhile, Russian forces had been reorganizing and reequipping, but their morale was reportedly low following a series of defeats.\n\n**Counteroffensive**\n\n### First phase (6–12 September 2022)\n\n#### Initial Advance\n\nOn 6 September 2022, Ukrainian forces launched their counteroffensive, with a series of coordinated attacks along the Oskil River. The initial advance was rapid, with Ukrainian troops quickly breaking through Russian lines and making significant gains. The Russian Army was caught off guard, and their defense was initially disorganized.\n\n#### Breakthrough\n\nOver the next few days, Ukrainian forces continued to push forward, making significant breakthroughs in several areas. They captured key towns and villages, including Izyum and Balakliya, and began to encircle Russian forces. The Russian Army was in disarray, with many units withdrawing in disorder.\n\n#### Russian withdrawal from Kharkiv Oblast west of Oskil River\n\nBy 10 September 2022, Ukrainian forces had advanced so far that they were able to push Russian forces back across the Oskil River, effectively retaking all of Kharkiv Oblast west of the river. The Russian Army had suffered significant losses, and their position was becoming increasingly precarious.\n\n#### Other gains and casualties\n\nIn addition to the advances along the Oskil River, Ukrainian forces had made significant gains in other areas. They had captured key infrastructure, including roads and bridges, and had disrupted Russian supply lines. The Russian Army had suffered significant casualties, including the loss of hundreds of soldiers and equipment.\n\n### Battle of Shevchenkove\n\nOn 9 September 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a major assault on the town of Shevchenkove, which was held by Russian forces. The battle was intense, with both sides suffering significant losses. However, Ukrainian forces ultimately emerged victorious, capturing the town and pushing Russian forces back.\n\n### Second phase (13 September–1 October 2022)\n\n#### Oskil River crossing\n\nOn 13 September 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a new phase of their counteroffensive, with a series of coordinated attacks along the Oskil River. The objective was to cross the river and establish a strong presence on the eastern bank. The operation was successful, with Ukrainian forces establishing a solid foothold on the eastern bank.\n\n#### Encirclement and recapture of Lyman\n\nOver the next few days, Ukrainian forces continued to push forward, encircling Russian forces and recapturing the town of Lyman. The Russian Army was in disarray, and their position was becoming increasingly precarious.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Russia\n\nThe Russian government was quick to respond to the Ukrainian counteroffensive, with President Vladimir Putin issuing a statement condemning the attacks. However, the Russian military was caught off guard, and their response was initially disorganized.\n\n### Worldwide\n\nThe international community was closely watching the situation in Ukraine, with many countries expressing concern over the humanitarian situation and the potential for further escalation. The United States, the United Kingdom, and other Western countries issued statements condemning the Russian invasion and supporting the Ukrain", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Kharkiv_counteroffensive\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Prelude\n#Counteroffensive\n##First phase (6–12 September 2022)\n###Initial advance\n###Breakthrough\n###Russian withdrawal from Kharkiv Oblast west of Oskil River\n###Other gains and casualties\n##Battle of Shevchenkove\n##Second phase (13 September–1 October 2022)\n###Oskil River crossing\n###Encirclement and recapture of Lyman\n#Reactions\n##Russia\n##Worldwide\n#Aftermath of the first phase\n##Mass graves and evidence of torture\n##Military decorations\n##Effect on Russian referendums\n##Captured Russian equipment\n#Aftermath of the second phase\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The order is known for its unique rituals, symbolism, and charitable work. With a rich history spanning over two centuries, the RAOB has a significant presence in several countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.\n\n**Coverage**\n\nThe RAOB has a global presence, with lodges and members spanning across different continents. The order has a strong presence in the UK, where it was founded, as well as in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The RAOB has also established a presence in other countries, including the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean. Despite its global reach, the RAOB remains a predominantly British organization, with many of its traditions and customs rooted in English culture.\n\n**Membership**\n\nMembership in the RAOB is open to individuals who are 18 years or older and who subscribe to the order's principles and values. To join the RAOB, individuals must be proposed by two existing members and undergo a series of interviews and tests to assess their suitability for membership. Once accepted, members are expected to attend lodge meetings, participate in charitable activities, and uphold the order's values and traditions.\n\n**Structure**\n\nThe RAOB has a hierarchical structure, with different levels of membership and a system of lodges and banners. The order is divided into several degrees, each with its own set of rituals and symbolism. Members can progress through the degrees, with each degree representing a higher level of commitment and involvement in the order.\n\n### Degrees\n\nThe RAOB has several degrees, each with its own unique rituals and symbolism. The degrees are as follows:\n\n* **Prince of Jerusalem**: The first degree, which represents the candidate's introduction to the order and its principles.\n* **Lodger**: The second degree, which represents the candidate's commitment to the order and its values.\n* **Esquire**: The third degree, which represents the candidate's advancement to a higher level of membership and responsibility.\n* **Knight of the Royal Antediluvian Order**: The fourth degree, which represents the candidate's full membership in the order and its highest level of commitment.\n* **Grand Primo**: The highest degree, which represents the candidate's election to the highest office in the order.\n\n### Minor Lodges\n\nMinor Lodges are smaller, local chapters of the RAOB that operate under the jurisdiction of a larger lodge or banner. Minor Lodges are often established in rural areas or in areas with a smaller population, and they provide a more intimate and local focus for members.\n\n### Banners\n\nBanners are larger, regional chapters of the RAOB that operate under the jurisdiction of a Grand Lodge or Grand Council. Banners are often established in major cities or regions, and they provide a higher level of organization and structure for members.\n\n### Use of \"Royal\"\n\nThe use of the word \"Royal\" in the RAOB's name and titles is a reference to the order's historical connection to the British monarchy. The RAOB was founded by a group of Freemasons who were also members of the British aristocracy, and the order's early rituals and symbolism reflected this connection.\n\n### Dispensations\n\nDispensations are temporary or emergency measures that allow a lodge or banner to deviate from the order's standard procedures or rituals. Dispensations are often granted in situations where a lodge or banner is facing a unique challenge or opportunity, and they provide a way for the order to adapt to changing circumstances.\n\n### Motto\n\nThe RAOB's motto is \"Perseverance and Help\".

The rebellion, led by Yevgeny Prigozhin and the Wagner Group, a private military company (PMC) closely associated with the Russian government, was a major challenge to the authority of the Russian government and the military leadership.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Yevgeny Prigozhin and the Wagner Group\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian businessman and military commander, founded the Wagner Group in 2014. The group, initially known as the \"Slavic Corps,\" was formed with the aim of supporting Russian interests in Ukraine. Over time, the group grew in size and influence, becoming one of the most prominent private military companies in the world. The Wagner Group has been involved in various conflicts, including the Syrian Civil War and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n### Internal tensions during the invasion of Ukraine\n\nTensions between the Wagner Group and the Russian military leadership had been building for some time. In 2022, the Russian military launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and the Wagner Group was deployed to support the Russian forces. However, the group's leaders, including Prigozhin, became increasingly frustrated with the Russian military leadership's handling of the war. The group felt that it was not being properly supported, and that the Russian military was not providing adequate resources or intelligence to the group.\n\n### Order to integrate Wagner\n\nIn the spring of 2023, the Russian military leadership ordered the Wagner Group to integrate into the Russian military, effectively dissolving the group as a separate entity. This move was seen as a power grab by the Russian military leadership, aimed at consolidating its control over the private military companies. The order sparked outrage among the Wagner Group's leaders, who felt that their autonomy and independence were being threatened.\n\n**Planning the rebellion**\n\nIn response to the order to integrate, the Wagner Group began to secretly plan a rebellion against the Russian military leadership. The group's leaders, including Prigozhin, felt that they had no choice but to take matters into their own hands and fight for their independence. The planning phase was marked by careful coordination and preparation, as the group's leaders knew that they would be facing a well-armed and well-trained Russian military.\n\n**Rebellion**\n\n### Prigozhin's statements\n\nOn June 23, 2023, Yevgeny Prigozhin made a series of statements in which he rebuked the Russian government and alleged that the military was planning to attack the Wagner Group. Prigozhin accused the Russian military leadership of trying to eliminate the group and claimed that the group was being unfairly blamed for the failures in Ukraine. He called on the Russian military leadership to stop the planned attack and warned that the group would not go quietly.\n\n### Call to rebellion\n\nIn the following days, Prigozhin's rhetoric became increasingly defiant, and he called on the Wagner Group to rise up against the Russian military leadership. The group's leaders, emboldened by Prigozhin's words, began to mobilize their forces and prepare for a confrontation with the Russian military.\n\n### Capture of Rostov-on-Don\n\nOn June 25, 2023, the Wagner Group, led by Prigozhin, captured the city of Rostov-on-Don, a strategic location in southern Russia. The group's forces, numbering in the thousands, quickly overran the city's defenses and took control of key infrastructure, including airports and military bases.\n\n### Advance towards Moscow\n\nThe following day, the Wagner Group, now in control of Rostov-on-Don, began to advance towards Moscow, the Russian capital. The group's leaders, driven by a desire for independence and a sense of betrayal by the Russian military leadership, were determined to challenge the government's authority and bring about a change in the country's leadership.\n\n### Security measures\n\nIn response to the Wagner Group's rebellion, the Russian government and military leadership took a series of security measures aimed at containing the situation. The government declared a state of emergency, and the military was put on high alert. The government also deployed troops to the affected regions and imposed a curfew in an effort to prevent the spread of the rebellion.\n\n### Events in Syria\n\nMeanwhile, in Syria, the Russian military, which had been involved in the conflict since 2015, was also affected by the Wagner Group's rebellion. The group's leaders, who had been involved in the conflict, began to mobilize their forces and prepare for a confrontation with the Russian military. The situation in Syria was marked by increasing tension and violence, as the group's forces clashed with the Russian military.\n\n**Resolution**\n\nOn July 1, 2023, the Wagner Group, led by Prigozhin, reached a deal with the Russian government, effectively ending the rebellion. The deal, brokered by the Russian defense minister, Sergey Shoigu, provided for the group's leaders to retire from active duty and for the group to be dissolved. In exchange, the government agreed to provide the group's leaders with immunity from prosecution and to allow them to maintain their business interests.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Domestic\n\n#### Vladimir Putin's address\n\nOn June 26, 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed the nation, urging the people to remain calm and to support the government's efforts to restore order. Putin praised the Russian military for its bravery and professionalism and called on the country's citizens to stand united against the Wagner Group's rebellion.\n\n#### Other government-aligned figures\n\nMany government-aligned figures, including politicians and media personalities, rallied behind Putin and the government, condemning the Wagner Group's rebellion as a treasonous act. They accused the group's leaders of trying to undermine the government's authority and of being puppets of foreign powers.\n\n#### Anti-war opposition and anti-government armed groups\n\nThe anti-war opposition and anti-government armed groups, which had been active in Russia for some time, saw the Wagner Group's rebellion as an opportunity to challenge the government's authority. They began to mobilize their forces and prepare for a confrontation with the government.\n\n#### Ultranationalists and milbloggers\n\nThe ultranationalists and milbloggers, who had been influential in shaping public opinion on the war in Ukraine, were divided in their response to the Wagner Group's rebellion. Some, who had been critical of the government's handling of the war, saw the rebellion as a legitimate response to the government's failures. Others, who had been loyal to the government, condemned the rebellion as a betrayal of national interests.\n\n#### Wider public\n\nThe wider public, which had been following the developments with great interest, was divided in their response to the Wagner Group's rebellion. Some, who had been critical of the government's handling of the war, saw the rebellion as a legitimate response to the government's failures. Others, who had been loyal to the government, condemned the rebellion as a betrayal of national interests.\n\n### International\n\nThe international community, which had been following the developments with great interest, was also divided in their response to the Wagner Group's rebellion. Some, including the United States and the European Union, condemned the rebellion as a threat to national stability and security. Others, including China and India, called for restraint and urged the parties to negotiate a peaceful resolution.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### Fallout and restoring order\n\nThe aftermath of the Wagner Group's rebellion was marked by a series of measures aimed at restoring order and stability in the country. The Russian military, which had been involved in the conflict, began to redeploy its forces and to restore control over key regions. The government, which had been criticized for its handling of the crisis, began to take steps to address the underlying issues and to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\n### Subsequent statements\n\nIn the following weeks and months, the leaders of the Wagner Group, including Prigozhin, made a series of statements in which they expressed their gratitude to the Russian people for their support and their commitment to the country's sovereignty. They also called on the government to take concrete steps to address the underlying issues and to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\n### Fate of the Wagner Group and Yevgeny Prigozhin\n\n#### Closure of criminal case and initial statements\n\nThe Russian authorities, in the aftermath of the rebellion, closed the criminal case against the Wagner Group, effectively ending the group's existence as a separate entity. Prigozhin, who had been a key figure in the group, made a series of statements in which he expressed his gratitude to the Russian people for their support and his commitment to the country's sovereignty.\n\n#### Crackdown on Wagner, alleged purges and related arrests\n\nThe Russian authorities, in the aftermath of the rebellion, launched a crackdown on the Wagner Group, arresting several of its leaders and members. The authorities also alleged that the group had been involved in a series of crimes, including murder, extortion, and money laundering.\n\n#### Prigozhin's return to Russia\n\nIn the aftermath of the rebellion, Prigozhin returned to Russia, where he was met with a mixture of support and criticism. The Russian authorities, while acknowledging his contributions to the country's security, also criticized him for his actions and his perceived disloyalty to the government.\n\n#### Death of Prigozhin and Utkin\n\nIn the following months, Prigozhin and Dmitry Utkin, the founder of the Wagner Group, were involved in a series of controversies, including their alleged involvement in a series of crimes and their perceived disloyalty to the government. The two men eventually died in a mysterious circumstances, with the Russian authorities ruling their deaths as a result of a car accident.\n\n**Measures of NATO countries**\n\nThe NATO countries, which had been following the developments with great interest, took a series of measures in response to the Wagner Group's rebellion. The countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Poland, condemned the rebellion as a threat to national stability and security and called for restraint. They also provided support to the Russian government and military in their efforts to restore order and stability in the country.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n### Political\n\nThe Wagner Group's rebellion was a significant political event in Russia, marking a major challenge to the government's authority and the military leadership.

Nonmetals are typically found on the right side of the periodic table, with the exception of hydrogen, which is a nonmetal but is located on the left side.\n\n**Definition and Applicable Elements**\n\nNonmetals are a class of elements that do not possess the characteristic properties of metals. They are typically non-lustrous, brittle, and have low electrical conductivity. Nonmetals are found in the right-hand side of the periodic table, with the exception of hydrogen, which is a nonmetal but is located on the left side. The following elements are classified as nonmetals:\n\n* Hydrogen (H)\n* Carbon (C)\n* Nitrogen (N)\n* Oxygen (O)\n* Fluorine (F)\n* Neon (Ne)\n* Phosphorus (P)\n* Sulfur (S)\n* Chlorine (Cl)\n* Argon (Ar)\n* Selenium (Se)\n* Bromine (Br)\n* Krypton (Kr)\n* Tellurium (Te)\n* Iodine (I)\n* Xenon (Xe)\n* Radon (Rn)\n\n**General Properties**\n\n### Physical\n\nNonmetals typically exhibit a range of physical properties, including:\n\n* Low melting and boiling points\n* Low density\n* Brittle or non-crystalline structure\n* Low thermal conductivity\n* Low electrical conductivity\n* Non-lustrous appearance\n\n### Allotropes\n\nMany nonmetals exhibit allotropy, which is the existence of different physical forms of an element. For example:\n\n* Carbon exists as diamond and graphite\n* Phosphorus exists as white phosphorus and red phosphorus\n* Sulfur exists as orthorhombic sulfur and monoclinic sulfur\n\n**Chemical**\n\nNonmetals typically exhibit a range of chemical properties, including:\n\n* Reactivity with other elements\n* Ability to form compounds with other elements\n* Ability to form ions or molecules\n* Ability to participate in chemical reactions\n\n**Complications**\n\n### First Row Anomaly\n\nThe first row of the periodic table, which includes hydrogen, lithium, beryllium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and neon, exhibits a range of anomalies that do not follow the expected trends. For example:\n\n* Hydrogen is a nonmetal, but is located on the left side of the periodic table\n* Lithium is an alkali metal, but exhibits some nonmetallic properties\n* Carbon is a nonmetal, but exhibits some metallic properties\n\n### Secondary Periodicity\n\nThe periodic table can be divided into two main blocks: the s-block and the p-block. The s-block elements, which include the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, exhibit a range of metallic properties. The p-block elements, which include the nonmetals and metalloids, exhibit a range of nonmetallic properties.\n\n### Higher Oxidation States\n\nMany nonmetals exhibit higher oxidation states, which are states of oxidation that are higher than the typical oxidation states for the element. For example:\n\n* Phosphorus exhibits a +5 oxidation state in phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5)\n* Sulfur exhibits a +6 oxidation state in sulfuric acid (H2SO4)\n\n### Multiple Bond Formation\n\nNonmetals are capable of forming multiple bonds with other elements, which involve the sharing of multiple pairs of electrons between atoms. For example:\n\n* Carbon forms triple bonds with oxygen in carbon dioxide (CO2)\n* Nitrogen forms double bonds with oxygen in nitrogen dioxide (NO2)\n\n### Property Overlaps\n\nMany nonmetals exhibit properties that overlap with metallic properties. For example:\n\n* Carbon is a nonmetal, but exhibits some metallic properties in the form of graphite\n* Phosphorus is a nonmetal, but exhibits some metallic properties in the form of white phosphorus\n\n**Types**\n\n### Noble Gases\n\nThe noble gases are a group of nonmetals that are found in the far right-hand side of the periodic table. These elements exhibit a range of properties, including:\n\n* Unreactivity with other elements\n* Low reactivity with other elements\n* Ability to exist as monatomic gases\n* Ability to form compounds with other elements\n\nThe noble gases include:\n\n* Helium (He)\n* Neon (Ne)\n* Argon (Ar)\n* Krypton (Kr)\n* Xenon (Xe)\n* Radon (Rn)\n\n### Halogen Nonmetals\n\nThe halogen nonmetals are a group of nonmetals that are found in the upper right-hand side of the periodic table. These elements exhibit a range of properties, including:\n\n* Reactivity with other elements\n* Ability to form compounds with other elements\n* Ability to form ions or molecules\n\nThe halogen nonmetals include:\n\n* Fluorine (F)\n* Chlorine (Cl)\n* Bromine (Br)\n* Iodine (I)\n* Astatine (At)\n\n### Unclassified Nonmetals\n\nThe unclassified nonmetals are a group of nonmetals that do not fit into the noble gas or halogen nonmetal categories. These elements exhibit a range of properties, including:\n\n* Reactivity with other elements\n* Ability to form compounds with other elements\n* Ability to form ions or molecules\n\nThe unclassified nonmetals include:\n\n* Carbon (C)\n* Nitrogen (N)\n* Oxygen (O)\n* Phosphorus (P)\n* Sulfur (S)\n* Selenium (Se)\n* Tellurium (Te)\n\n**Abundance, Extraction, and Uses**\n\n### Abundance\n\nNonmetals are found in a range of natural sources, including:\n\n* Earth's crust\n* Atmosphere\n* Oceans\n* Minerals\n\nThe abundance of nonmetals varies widely, with some elements being highly abundant and others being rare.\n\n### Extraction\n\nNonmetals can be extracted from a range of sources, including:\n\n* Mining\n* Refining\n* Smelting\n* Purification\n\nThe extraction of nonmetals often involves the use of complex processes and technologies.\n\n### Uses\n\nNonmetals have a range of uses, including:\n\n* Industrial applications\n* Medical applications\n* Energy applications\n* Consumer products\n\nNonmetals are used in a wide range of products, including:\n\n* Electronics\n* Pharmaceuticals\n* Energy storage devices\n* Building materials\n\n**Taxonomical History**\n\n### Background\n\nThe classification of nonmetals is a complex and evolving field. Early chemists recognized the distinction between metals and nonmetals, but the exact boundaries between these categories were not well-defined.\n\n### Organization of Elements by Types\n\nThe modern periodic table is a fundamental tool for organizing elements by type. The periodic table is arranged in a way that reflects the relationships between elements, with similar elements grouped together and periodic trends evident.\n\n### Development of Types\n\nThe development of the periodic table was a gradual process, with early chemists recognizing the existence of different types of elements and later chemists refining the classification of these elements.\n\n### Suggested Distinguishing Criteria\n\nSeveral criteria have been suggested for distinguishing between nonmetals and metals, including:\n\n* Reactivity with other elements\n* Ability to form compounds with other elements\n* Ability to form ions or molecules\n* Physical properties, such as melting and boiling points\n\nHowever, these criteria are not universally accepted and the classification of nonmetals remains a subject of ongoing debate.\n\n**Comparison of Selected Properties**\n\n### Physical Properties by Element Type\n\nThe physical properties of nonmetals vary widely, with some elements exhibiting very different properties from others.\n\n| Element | Melting Point (°C) | Boiling Point (°C) | Density (g/cm3) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Carbon (C) | 3800 | 4600 | 3.51 |\n| Nitrogen (N) | -210 | -196 | 0.00125 |\n| Oxygen (O) | -218 | -182 | 0.00143 |\n| Phosphorus (P) | 110 | 280 | 1.82 |\n| Sulfur (S) | 115 | 444 | 2.07 |\n\n### Chemical Properties by Element Type\n\nThe chemical properties of nonmetals also vary widely, with some elements exhibiting very different properties from others.\n\n| Element | Oxidation State | Reactivity with Other Elements |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Carbon (C) | -4, 0, +4, +4 | Highly reactive |\n| Nitrogen (N) | +3, +5 | Moderately reactive |\n| Oxygen (O) | -2 | Highly reactive |\n| Phosphorus (P) | +3, +5 | Highly reactive |\n| Sulfur (S) | +4, +6 | Highly reactive |\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Metals\n* Metalloids\n* Alkali metals\n* Alkaline earth metals\n* Halogen metals\n* Noble gases\n* Periodic table\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The classification of nonmetals is a complex and evolving field.\n* The boundaries between nonmetals and other categories of elements are not universally accepted.\n* The properties of nonmetals vary widely, with some elements exhibiting very different properties from others.\n\n**References**\n\n* Atkins, P.

The playoffs began on January 14, 2023, and concluded on February 12, 2023.\n\n# Participants\n\n## Unused format changes following Week 17 canceled Bills–Bengals game\n\nOn December 17, 2022, the Buffalo Bills and Cincinnati Bengals game scheduled for Week 17 was canceled due to a COVID-19 outbreak among Bengals players. As a result, the NFL decided to use the usual seeding format for the playoffs, rather than the revised one that was to be used for the first time in the 2022 season. This meant that the teams with the best win-loss records in each conference would be seeded 1 through 7, with the exception of the teams that earned a first-round bye. The teams that earned a first-round bye were the top two seeds in each conference.\n\n## New postseason overtime rule\n\nPrior to the 2022 season, the NFL did not have a specific rule governing overtime in the postseason. However, in 2022, the NFL introduced a new rule that would govern overtime in the postseason. According to the rule, if the score was tied at the end of regulation, the game would proceed to overtime. In overtime, the teams would play a 10-minute quarter, and if the score was still tied at the end of the 10-minute quarter, the game would continue until a winner was determined.\n\n# Bracket\n\nThe playoff bracket consisted of four rounds: the Wild Card playoffs, the Divisional playoffs, the Conference Championships, and the Super Bowl. The teams that earned a first-round bye were the top two seeds in each conference. The teams that did not earn a first-round bye played each other in the Wild Card playoffs, with the winners advancing to the Divisional playoffs.\n\n# Schedule\n\n## Wild Card playoffs\n\n### Saturday, January 14, 2023\n\n* NFC: San Francisco 49ers 41, Seattle Seahawks 23\n* AFC: Jacksonville Jaguars 31, Los Angeles Chargers 30\n\n### Sunday, January 15, 2023\n\n* AFC: Buffalo Bills 34, Miami Dolphins 31\n* NFC: New York Giants 31, Minnesota Vikings 24\n* AFC: Cincinnati Bengals 24, Baltimore Ravens 17\n\n### Monday, January 16, 2023\n\n* NFC: Dallas Cowboys 31, Tampa Bay Buccaneers 14\n\n## Divisional playoffs\n\n### Saturday, January 21, 2023\n\n* AFC: Kansas City Chiefs 27, Jacksonville Jaguars 20\n* NFC: Philadelphia Eagles 38, New York Giants 7\n\n### Sunday, January 22, 2023\n\n* AFC: Cincinnati Bengals 27, Buffalo Bills 10\n* NFC: San Francisco 49ers 19, Dallas Cowboys 12\n\n## Conference Championships\n\n### Sunday, January 29, 2023\n\n* NFC Championship Game: Philadelphia Eagles 31, San Francisco 49ers 7\n* AFC Championship Game: Kansas City Chiefs 23, Cincinnati Bengals 20\n\n## Super Bowl LVII: Kansas City Chiefs 38, Philadelphia Eagles 35\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LVII on February 12, 2023.

Grusch's claims have sparked significant interest and debate within the UFO community and beyond.\n\n**Background**\n\nDavid Grusch served as a career intelligence official in the United States government, working extensively on matters related to UAP and national security. His background in intelligence and experience working with sensitive information have contributed to his credibility as a whistleblower.\n\nGrusch's claims of UAP sightings and alleged government cover-ups have been largely centered around the existence of extraterrestrial life and the potential for UAPs to be of non-human origin. His statements have touched on the possibility of a covert government program aimed at investigating and containing UAP-related phenomena.\n\n**Grusch's Public Claims**\n\nIn 2020, Grusch came forward as a whistleblower, sharing his claims with the public through various media outlets. He alleged that the United States government had been aware of UAP sightings for decades, and that these sightings were often associated with extraterrestrial activity. Grusch also claimed that the government had been working to hide this information from the public and to suppress any discussion of UAPs within the scientific community.\n\nGrusch's claims included assertions that UAP sightings were not just random events, but rather indicative of a larger phenomenon that had been observed and studied by government agencies. He also claimed that some UAP sightings were associated with unusual physical effects, such as unusual lighting or radiation patterns.\n\n**Response from Relevant Experts**\n\nExperts in the fields of UAP research, intelligence, and astronomy have responded to Grusch's claims with a mix of interest and skepticism. While some have praised Grusch's courage in coming forward as a whistleblower, others have questioned the credibility of his claims and the evidence he has presented.\n\nSome experts have pointed out that Grusch's claims are largely anecdotal and based on unverified sources, which makes it difficult to verify the accuracy of his statements. Others have suggested that Grusch's claims may be part of a disinformation campaign aimed at generating interest and publicity.\n\n**United States Government Responses**\n\nThe United States government has responded to Grusch's claims with a mix of statements and actions. In 2021, the Department of Defense (DoD) released a statement confirming the existence of UAP sightings, but emphasized that there was no evidence to suggest that these sightings were of extraterrestrial origin.\n\n**Department of Defense and NASA Statements**\n\nThe DoD and NASA have both issued statements regarding UAP sightings, but these statements have been largely cautious and non-committal. In 2021, the DoD released a report on UAP sightings, which concluded that most sightings could be explained by natural phenomena or human error. However, the report also noted that some sightings remained unexplained and required further investigation.\n\nNASA has also issued statements on UAP sightings, but these statements have been largely focused on the scientific study of UAPs rather than their potential extraterrestrial origins.\n\n**Congressional Action and Comments from Members**\n\nCongress has taken an interest in UAP research and has held hearings on the topic. In 2022, the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability held a hearing on UAP research, during which Grusch testified. Some members of Congress have expressed interest in exploring the potential for extraterrestrial life, while others have questioned the credibility of Grusch's claims.\n\n**2023 House Committee Oversight and Accountability Hearing**\n\nIn 2023, the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability held a second hearing on UAP research, during which Grusch testified again. The hearing was marked by controversy, as some members of Congress questioned Grusch's credibility and the accuracy of his claims.\n\n**Sean Kirkpatrick**\n\nSean Kirkpatrick is a former government official who has been involved in UAP research. Kirkpatrick has been critical of Grusch's claims, suggesting that they are exaggerated and lacking in evidence. Kirkpatrick has also expressed concern that Grusch's claims may be part of a disinformation campaign aimed at generating interest and publicity.\n\n**Media Reporting on Grusch's Claims**\n\nThe media has reported extensively on Grusch's claims, with some outlets expressing skepticism and others lending credence to his assertions. Some media outlets have highlighted connections between Grusch's claims and studies funded by Robert Bigelow, a billionaire who has been involved in UAP research.\n\n**Connections to Studies Funded by Robert Bigelow**\n\nGrusch's claims have been linked to studies funded by Robert Bigelow, who has been a major funder of UAP research. Bigelow has been involved in research at the Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies (BAASS) program, which has been accused of promoting pseudoscience and disinformation.\n\n**Reporting on Psychiatric Treatment Received by Grusch**\n\nSome media outlets have reported on Grusch's receipt of psychiatric treatment, which Grusch has attributed to the stress of being a whistleblower. However, some experts have questioned the accuracy of these reports and suggested that they may be part of a disinformation campaign aimed at discrediting Grusch.\n\n**News Stories and Commentary**\n\nNews stories and commentary on Grusch's claims have been extensive, with some outlets expressing skepticism and others lending credence to his assertions. Some media pundits have accused Grusch of being part of a disinformation campaign aimed at generating interest and publicity.\n\n**Disinformation Campaign Allegations from Media Pundits**\n\nSome media pundits have accused Grusch of being part of a disinformation campaign aimed at generating interest and publicity. However, others have defended Grusch's credibility and suggested that his claims may be part of a legitimate effort to expose government secrecy.\n\n**Additional Responses from Media Pundits**\n\nMedia pundits have responded to Grusch's claims with a mix of skepticism and support. Some have questioned the accuracy of his claims and the evidence he has presented, while others have praised his courage in coming forward as a whistleblower.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP)\n* Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO)\n* Intelligence Community\n* Department of Defense\n* NASA\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: This article does not include references as per the requirements)\n\n**External Links**\n\n* [David Grusch's website](https://www.davidgrusch.com)\n* [Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies (BAASS) program](https://www.baass.org)\n* [House Committee on Oversight and Accountability](https://oversight.house.gov)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"David_Grusch_UFO_whistleblower_claims\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Grusch's public claims\n#Response from relevant experts\n#United States government responses\n##Department of Defense and NASA statements\n##Congressional action and comments from members\n##2023 House Committee Oversight and Accountability hearing\n#Sean Kirkpatrick\n#Media reporting on Grusch's claims\n##Connections to studies funded by Robert Bigelow\n##Reporting on psychiatric treatment received by Grusch\n##News stories and commentary\n##Disinformation campaign allegations from media pundits\n##Additional responses from media pundits\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name and is a spin-off of the Spider-Man film series. The film stars Jared Leto as the titular character, alongside Michael Keaton, Adria Arjona, Jared Harris, and AlMadridge.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film follows the story of Dr. Michael Morbius, a brilliant scientist who suffers from a rare blood disorder. Desperate to find a cure, Morbius experiments on himself using the blood of a rare bat, which gives him superhuman powers. However, the process also has a dark side effect, causing Morbius to become a bloodthirsty vampire-like creature.\n\nAs Morbius struggles to control his new powers, he becomes a danger to those around him, including his loved ones. The film follows Morbius's journey as he tries to find a cure for his condition and make amends for the harm he has caused.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Jared Leto as Dr. Michael Morbius\n* Michael Keaton as Dr. Emil Nicholas\n* Adria Arjona as Martine Bancroft\n* Jared Harris as Captain Martinez\n* AlMadridge as Loxias\n* Tyrese Gibson as Simon Stroud\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe film was first announced in 2007, with Blade director Guillermo del Toro attached to direct and write the script. However, the project stalled due to creative differences and del Toro's departure from the project.\n\nIn 2017, it was announced that Daniel Espinosa would direct the film, with Jared Leto set to star as Morbius. The script was rewritten by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, who also wrote the screenplays for the Doctor Strange and The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones films.\n\n### Pre-production\n\nPre-production for the film began in 2018, with the casting of Adria Arjona as Martine Bancroft, Morbius's love interest. The film's production design was overseen by Patrice Vermette, who also designed the sets for the film's predecessor, Spider-Man: Homecoming.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for the film began in March 2019 and lasted for approximately six months. The film was shot on location in London and Budapest, with a budget of around $75 million.\n\n### Post-production\n\nPost-production for the film took several months to complete, with the film's visual effects being handled by Sony Pictures Imageworks. The film's score was composed by Jon Ehrlich, who also composed the music for the film's predecessor, Spider-Man: Far From Home.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe film's soundtrack was released in 2022 and features a mix of electronic and orchestral music. The soundtrack was well-received by critics, with many praising the film's score as one of the best aspects of the film.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe film's marketing campaign was heavily focused on promoting the film's horror elements, with several trailers and TV spots showcasing the film's darker tone. The film's posters and promotional materials also featured a darker, more ominous aesthetic.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Theatrical\n\nThe film was released in theaters on March 19, 2022, in the United States and several other countries. The film's opening weekend saw a modest box office performance, with the film grossing around $59 million worldwide.\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film was released on digital platforms on May 17, 2022, and on Blu-ray and DVD on June 7, 2022.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film's box office performance was underwhelming, with the film grossing around $163 million worldwide on a budget of $75 million. The film's performance was seen as a disappointment by many, particularly given the film's marketing campaign.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, with many praising the film's visuals and action sequences, but criticizing the film's narrative and characters. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 43% approval rating, based on 304 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The critical consensus on the site reads: \"Morbius' visuals can't compensate for its soulless narrative and underdeveloped characters.\"\n\n### Internet memes\n\nThe film became a subject of internet memes, with many users mocking the film's poor box office performance and its perceived lack of quality. The film's marketing campaign was also mocked, with many users criticizing the film's trailers and promotional materials for being over-the-top and misleading.\n\n**Future**\n\nDespite the film's poor performance, Sony Pictures has expressed interest in continuing the Morbius franchise, with a potential sequel and spin-off films in development. However, the future of the franchise remains uncertain, and it is unclear whether the studio will follow through with its plans.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe film's title, Morbius, was inspired by the Latin word for \"disease,\" which reflects the film's themes of illness and transformation.\n\nThe film's score was composed by Jon Ehrlich, who also composed the music for the film's predecessor, Spider-Man: Far From Home.\n\nThe film's visual effects were handled by Sony Pictures Imageworks, who also worked on the visual effects for the film's predecessor, Spider-Man: Homecoming.\n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website\n* Morbius at IMDb\n* Morbius at Box Office Mojo\n* Morbius at Rotten Tomatoes\n* Morbius at Metacritic", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Morbius_(film)\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Pre-production\n##Filming\n##Post-production\n#Music\n#Marketing\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Internet memes\n#Future\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The path continues south, eventually ending at the intersection of Washington Boulevard and Lincoln Boulevard in the Playa del Rey neighborhood.\n\nOne notable feature of the route is its proximity to the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). The path passes within a few hundred feet of the airport's perimeter, offering views of the airport's runways and terminals.\n\n**Airport**\n\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path's proximity to LAX has both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, the path provides a unique opportunity for cyclists and pedestrians to view the airport's operations up close. On the other hand, the noise and air pollution generated by the airport can be a nuisance for users of the path.\n\nDespite these challenges, the path remains a popular destination for those seeking to combine outdoor recreation with a glimpse of the airport's operations. In fact, many users of the path report that the views of the airport's runways and terminals are a major draw, offering a unique perspective on the city's transportation infrastructure.\n\n**Conditions**\n\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path is generally well-maintained, with a smooth and level surface suitable for a wide range of users. The path is paved with asphalt, making it easy to navigate for cyclists, pedestrians, and wheelchairs.\n\nHowever, the path's conditions can vary depending on the time of year and weather patterns. During the rainy season, the path may become muddy and slippery, making it difficult to navigate. Similarly, during periods of extreme heat, the asphalt can become hot and uncomfortable to walk or bike on.\n\n**Rest stops**\n\nThere are several rest stops and access points along the Ballona Creek Bike Path, offering users a chance to take a break and enjoy the scenery. These rest stops often feature benches, picnic tables, and trash receptacles, as well as public art installations and educational signs about the creek's history and ecology.\n\nOne popular rest stop is the Ballona Creek Interpretive Center, located near the intersection of Lincoln Boulevard and Centinela Avenue. The center features a small exhibit on the creek's history and ecology, as well as a gift shop and restrooms.\n\n**Homeless camping**\n\nUnfortunately, the Ballona Creek Bike Path has become a popular destination for homeless camping, with many individuals setting up tent encampments along the path. This has raised concerns about public safety, sanitation, and the impact on the path's users.\n\nIn response to these concerns, the city of Los Angeles has implemented several measures to address homeless camping on the path. These measures include increased enforcement of park rules and regulations, as well as the provision of social services and outreach programs to help individuals access housing and support services.\n\n**Access gates**\n\nThere are several access gates along the Ballona Creek Bike Path, allowing users to enter and exit the path at various points. These gates are typically located near rest stops and other amenities, and are designed to provide easy access to the path for users of all ages and abilities.\n\nOne notable access gate is the Ballona Creek Bridge, located near the intersection of Centinela Avenue and Venice Boulevard. The bridge offers stunning views of the creek and its surroundings, and is a popular spot for photographers and nature enthusiasts.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path has a rich and varied history, dating back to the early 20th century. In the 1920s and 1930s, the path was used as a popular destination for horseback riding and picnicking. During World War II, the path was used as a military training ground, with soldiers using the creek as a training area for amphibious landings.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the path became a popular destination for recreational users, with the establishment of the Ballona Creek Interpretive Center and the creation of several access gates and rest stops. Today, the path remains a popular destination for outdoor recreation, with thousands of users visiting the path each year.\n\n**Improvements**\n\nIn recent years, the city of Los Angeles has made several improvements to the Ballona Creek Bike Path, including the installation of new lighting and signage, as well as the creation of several new access gates and rest stops. The city has also implemented several measures to address homeless camping on the path, including increased enforcement of park rules and regulations.\n\nIn addition, the city has established several partnerships with local community groups and organizations to improve the path and its surroundings. These partnerships have focused on issues such as habitat restoration, water quality improvement, and public safety.\n\n**Proposed extensions**\n\nThere are several proposed extensions to the Ballona Creek Bike Path, including a proposed link to the Marvin Braude Bike Trail, which runs along the beachfront in Santa Monica. The proposed extension would provide a new route for cyclists and pedestrians, offering stunning views of the ocean and the surrounding coastline.\n\nAnother proposed extension is a link to the San Diego Creek Bikeway, which runs along the San Diego Creek in the San Diego neighborhood of Los Angeles. The proposed extension would provide a new route for cyclists and pedestrians, offering views of the creek and its surroundings.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n[Image: Ballona Creek Bike Path, looking east towards the Los Angeles International Airport]\n\n[Image: Ballona Creek Interpretive Center, with exhibit on the creek's history and ecology]\n\n[Image: Access gate at Ballona Creek Bridge, with views of the creek and its surroundings]\n\n[Image: Rest stop with picnic tables and public art installation]\n\n**See also**\n\n* Ballona Creek\n* Los Angeles International Airport\n* Marvin Braude Bike Trail\n* San Diego Creek Bikeway\n* City of Los Angeles Parks and Recreation Department\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: No references are included in this article)\n\n**External links**\n\n* City of Los Angeles Parks and Recreation Department: Ballona Creek Bike Path\n* Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation: Ballona Creek Bike Path\n* Ballona Creek Conservancy: Ballona Creek Bike Path", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ballona_Creek_Bike_Path\" following this outline:\n\n#Route\n##Airport\n#Conditions\n##Rest stops\n##Homeless camping\n#Access gates\n#History\n#Improvements\n#Proposed extensions\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The earthquakes triggered widespread destruction, loss of life, and a massive humanitarian crisis.\n\n**Tectonic Setting**\n\nThe region affected by the earthquakes is located in the Eastern Mediterranean, where the African and Eurasian tectonic plates meet. This region is seismically active, with a history of earthquakes dating back to ancient times.\n\n### Geology\n\nThe geology of the region is characterized by a mix of sedimentary and volcanic rocks, with a thick layer of soft sediments and a brittle crust. This combination of factors makes the region prone to earthquakes.\n\n### Seismicity\n\nThe region has experienced several significant earthquakes in the past, including a M7.4 earthquake in 1668 and a M6.5 earthquake in 1872. However, the earthquakes of 2023 were the most destructive in recent history.\n\n**Earthquake Sequence**\n\nThe earthquake sequence consisted of two main events, followed by numerous aftershocks.\n\n### Aftershocks\n\nThe aftershocks were intense and continued for several days, causing further damage and disruptions to rescue efforts.\n\n### Seismology\n\nThe earthquakes were characterized by a complex rupture process, with multiple fault ruptures and a significant amount of slip on the main faults.\n\n### Rupture Propagation\n\nThe rupture propagation was rapid, with the earthquakes occurring within a short period of time. This rapid rupture propagation was likely due to the complex geology of the region.\n\n### Surface Rupture\n\nThe surface rupture was significant, with large cracks and fissures visible in the affected areas.\n\n### Ground Motion\n\nThe ground motion was intense, with reports of shaking and ground deformation in the affected areas.\n\n### Geological Effects\n\nThe earthquakes triggered a range of geological effects, including landslides, rockfalls, and soil liquefaction.\n\n### Tsunami\n\nThere was a small tsunami triggered by the earthquakes, but it caused minimal damage.\n\n### Effects on Other Faults\n\nThe earthquakes had a significant impact on other faults in the region, with increased seismicity and deformation observed on nearby faults.\n\n**Damage and Casualties**\n\nThe damage and casualties from the earthquakes were widespread and devastating.\n\n### In Turkey\n\nThe damage in Turkey was extensive, with thousands of buildings collapsed or damaged, and many more displaced.

The series depicts Campbell's soup cans in various colors and configurations, and is considered one of the most iconic and influential works of the Pop Art movement.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Cans series was a groundbreaking work that challenged traditional notions of art and consumer culture. Warhol's use of a mundane, mass-produced object as the subject of a work of art was a bold statement about the banality and ubiquity of modern life. The series has become an iconic representation of American culture and a testament to the power of art to reflect and shape our perceptions of the world.\n\n**Early Career**\n\n**New York Art Scene**\n\nWarhol's early career in the art world was marked by a fascination with the commercial and consumerist aspects of modern life. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he began to create silkscreen prints of consumer products, such as chewing gum wrappers and newspaper advertisements. These early works laid the groundwork for the Campbell's Soup Cans series and established Warhol as a key figure in the emerging Pop Art movement.\n\n**Pop Art**\n\nPop Art was a movement that emerged in the late 1950s and 1960s, characterized by its use of popular culture and consumer products as subject matter. Warhol was a leading figure in the movement, along with artists such as Roy Lichtenstein and Jasper Johns. Pop Art challenged traditional notions of high art and sought to blur the line between art and commerce. The Campbell's Soup Cans series was a quintessential example of this movement, using a ubiquitous consumer product as the subject of a work of art.\n\n**Premiere**\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Cans series premiered at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles on April 17, 1962. The exhibition was a groundbreaking event, featuring 32 silkscreen prints of Campbell's soup cans in various colors and configurations. The show was a huge success, with visitors drawn to the novelty and familiarity of the subject matter.\n\n**Subsequent Publicity**\n\nThe success of the exhibition was followed by a series of newspaper and magazine articles, which helped to cement the Campbell's Soup Cans series as a cultural phenomenon. The show was seen as a bold statement about the banality and ubiquity of modern life, and its impact was felt far beyond the art world.\n\n**Campbell's Soup Company**\n\n**Can and Label History**\n\nCampbell's Soup Company was founded in 1869 by Joseph A. Campbell, and was initially known for its canned vegetables and soups. The company's iconic soup cans were first introduced in the early 20th century, and featured a distinctive red and white label. The cans became ubiquitous in American grocery stores, and were seen as a symbol of convenience and accessibility.\n\n**Relation to Warhol's Art**\n\nWarhol's use of Campbell's soup cans as the subject of his art was a deliberate choice, made to reflect the ubiquity and banality of modern life. Warhol was fascinated by the way that consumer products like Campbell's soup cans became part of the fabric of everyday life, and he sought to capture that sense of familiarity and ubiquity in his art. The use of a mundane, mass-produced object as the subject of a work of art was a bold statement about the power of art to reflect and shape our perceptions of the world.\n\n**Inspiration**\n\n**Artist Colleagues**\n\nWarhol's use of Campbell's soup cans as the subject of his art was influenced by his artist colleagues, who were also exploring the possibilities of Pop Art. Artists such as Roy Lichtenstein and Jasper Johns were experimenting with similar themes, using consumer products and popular culture as subject matter. Warhol's use of Campbell's soup cans was a deliberate choice, made to reflect the banality and ubiquity of modern life.\n\n**Interpretation**\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Cans series has been interpreted in a variety of ways, reflecting the complexity and multifaceted nature of the work. Some have seen the series as a commentary on the banality and ubiquity of modern life, while others have interpreted it as a reflection of the power of art to shape our perceptions of the world. The series has also been seen as a commentary on the commercial and consumerist aspects of modern life, and the ways in which art can be used to reflect and shape our perceptions of the world.\n\n**Variations**\n\n**Campbell's Soup I and Campbell's Soup Cans II**\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Cans series was initially created in a single configuration, featuring 32 silkscreen prints of Campbell's soup cans in various colors and configurations. However, Warhol went on to create a number of variations on the series, including Campbell's Soup I and Campbell's Soup Cans II. These works featured different colors and configurations, and were created using a range of techniques, including silkscreen printing and hand-painting.\n\n**Colored Soup Cans**\n\nIn addition to the original Campbell's Soup Cans series, Warhol also created a number of colored versions of the work. These versions featured soup cans in a range of bright, bold colors, and were created using a variety of techniques, including silkscreen printing and hand-painting. The colored versions of the work added a new level of complexity and nuance to the series, and reflected Warhol's ongoing fascination with the possibilities of color and image.\n\n**Unauthorized Versions**\n\nIn addition to the official versions of the Campbell's Soup Cans series, a number of unauthorized versions were created by artists and designers. These versions often featured modifications to the original design, such as changes to the color or configuration of the soup cans. The unauthorized versions of the work were often seen as a commentary on the commercial and consumerist aspects of modern life, and the ways in which art can be used to reflect and shape our perceptions of the world.\n\n**Other Variations**\n\nWarhol also created a number of other variations on the Campbell's Soup Cans series, including works featuring other consumer products, such as chewing gum wrappers and newspaper advertisements. These works reflected Warhol's ongoing fascination with the possibilities of Pop Art, and his desire to explore the complexities and nuances of modern life.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Cans series is a landmark work of American art, and a testament to the power of art to reflect and shape our perceptions of the world. The series has been interpreted in a variety of ways, reflecting the complexity and multifaceted nature of the work. From its origins in the New York art scene to its global popularity today, the Campbell's Soup Cans series remains a powerful and enduring symbol of American culture.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Pop Art\n* Andy Warhol\n* Roy Lichtenstein\n* Jasper Johns\n* Campbell's Soup Company\n* Consumer culture\n* Commercialism\n* Art and commerce\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Campbell's Soup Cans series was first exhibited at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles in 1962.\n* The series was created using a variety of techniques, including silkscreen printing and hand-painting.\n* The series features a range of colors and configurations, including the original red and white labels.\n* The series has been interpreted in a variety of ways, reflecting the complexity and multifaceted nature of the work.\n* The series has been seen as a commentary on the banality and ubiquity of modern life, as well as the power of art to shape our perceptions of the world.\n\n**References**\n\n* Warhol, A.

The mission was a critical test of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and the Orion spacecraft, designed to carry astronauts on long-duration missions to the Moon and beyond.\n\n**Mission Profile**\n\nThe Artemis I mission profile was designed to test the performance of the SLS rocket and the Orion spacecraft in a lunar flyby configuration. The mission was divided into several key phases:\n\n### Mission Profile Animation\n\nAn animation of the Artemis I mission profile was released by NASA, showing the trajectory of the spacecraft from launch to reentry. The animation provided a visual representation of the mission's key events, including launch, outbound flight, lunar flyby, and return flight.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Artemis program was established by NASA in 2019 to return humans to the lunar surface by 2025. The program was designed to be a stepping stone for further human exploration of the solar system, with the ultimate goal of establishing a sustainable presence on the lunar surface. Artemis I was the first mission in the program, aimed at testing the SLS rocket and the Orion spacecraft in a lunar flyby configuration.\n\n### Ground Testing\n\nThe SLS rocket and the Orion spacecraft underwent extensive ground testing before the Artemis I mission. The rocket's core stage was tested at the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi, while the Orion spacecraft was tested at the Plum Brook Station in Ohio. The tests focused on the performance of the rocket's engines and the spacecraft's heat shield.\n\n### Assembly\n\nThe SLS rocket and the Orion spacecraft were assembled at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The rocket's core stage was built at the Michoud Assembly Facility in Louisiana, while the Orion spacecraft was built at the Kennedy Space Center. The spacecraft and rocket were integrated at the Kennedy Space Center, where they were prepared for launch.\n\n### Launch Preparations\n\nThe Artemis I mission was launched from the Kennedy Space Center on November 16, 2022. The launch was conducted using the SLS rocket, with the Orion spacecraft perched on top of the rocket. The launch preparations involved a series of checks and tests to ensure that the rocket and spacecraft were functioning properly.\n\n### Initial Launch Attempts\n\nThe Artemis I mission was delayed several times due to technical issues with the SLS rocket. The rocket experienced a faulty sensor, which prevented the mission from launching on time. The issue was resolved through a series of repairs and tests, which allowed the mission to launch on November 16, 2022.\n\n**Flight**\n\nThe Artemis I mission involved a series of critical events, including launch, outbound flight, lunar flyby, and return flight.\n\n### Launch\n\nThe Artemis I mission was launched from the Kennedy Space Center on November 16, 2022. The SLS rocket lifted off at 1:47 AM EST, carrying the Orion spacecraft into space. The launch was observed by thousands of spectators at the Kennedy Space Center.\n\n### Outbound Flight\n\nThe Orion spacecraft traveled through space for several days, reaching a distance of approximately 280,000 miles from Earth. The spacecraft was propelled by a combination of the SLS rocket's upper stage and the Orion spacecraft's own propulsion system.\n\n### Lunar Orbit\n\nThe Artemis I mission did not enter lunar orbit, but rather flew by the Moon at a distance of approximately 4,100 miles. The flyby provided an opportunity to test the performance of the Orion spacecraft in a lunar flyby configuration.\n\n### Return Flight\n\nThe Orion spacecraft began its return flight to Earth on December 11, 2022. The spacecraft was propelled by the SLS rocket's upper stage, which had been jettisoned earlier in the mission. The spacecraft re-entered Earth's atmosphere on December 11, 2022, and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean.\n\n### Reentry and Splashdown\n\nThe Orion spacecraft re-entered Earth's atmosphere on December 11, 2022, at a velocity of approximately 25,000 mph. The spacecraft was protected by a heat shield, which withstood the extreme temperatures generated during re-entry. The spacecraft splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, where it was recovered by a NASA team.\n\n**Payloads**\n\nThe Artemis I mission carried a number of payloads, including cubesats and other scientific instruments.\n\n### Cubesats\n\nThe Artemis I mission carried a number of cubesats, which were designed to test the performance of small spacecraft in a lunar flyby configuration. The cubesats were built by a number of universities and research institutions, and were launched on the Orion spacecraft.\n\n**Media Outreach**\n\nThe Artemis I mission was widely covered by the media, with thousands of journalists and media outlets following the mission's progress. NASA provided a number of updates and press releases, which were widely reported by the media.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Artemis program\n* Space Launch System\n* Orion spacecraft\n* Lunar flyby\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe Artemis I mission was a critical test of the Space Launch System rocket and the Orion spacecraft. The mission demonstrated the performance of the rocket and spacecraft in a lunar flyby configuration, and provided valuable insights for future human missions to the Moon and beyond.\n\n**References**\n\n None\n\n**External Links**\n\n* NASA Artemis Program\n* Space Launch System (SLS) Rocket\n* Orion Spacecraft", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Artemis_I\" following this outline:\n\n#Mission profile\n##Mission profile animation\n#Background\n##Ground testing\n##Assembly\n##Launch preparations\n##Initial launch attempts\n#Flight\n##Launch\n##Outbound flight\n##Lunar orbit\n##Return flight\n##Reentry and splashdown\n#Payloads\n##Cubesats\n#Media outreach\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election was the 47th federal election in Australian history and the fifth election since the introduction of compulsory preferential voting.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Previous election\n\nThe previous federal election was held on 18 May 2019, with the Australian Labor Party (ALP) led by Anthony Albanese defeating the Liberal Party of Australia (LP) led by Scott Morrison. The ALP won 77 seats in the House of Representatives, while the LP won 51 seats.\n\n### Composition of parliament\n\nFollowing the 2019 election, the Australian Parliament consisted of:\n\n* House of Representatives: 151 members, with 90 members from the ALP, 48 members from the LP, 6 members from the National Party of Australia (NPA), 1 member from the Australian Greens, and 6 independent members.\n* Senate: 76 members, with 26 members from the ALP, 26 members from the LP, 4 members from the NPA, 1 member from the Australian Greens, and 19 independent senators.\n\n### Events of the 46th Parliament\n\nDuring the 46th Parliament, several key events occurred, including:\n\n* The COVID-19 pandemic, which led to widespread lockdowns, border closures, and economic restrictions.\n* The Black Summer bushfires, which burned millions of hectares of land and killed hundreds of people.\n* The Australian government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the introduction of vaccination mandates and mask-wearing requirements.\n* The government's budget and economic policies, including the introduction of a JobKeeper wage subsidy and a series of tax cuts.\n\n### Change in party registration rules\n\nPrior to the 2022 election, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) changed its rules regarding party registration. The AEC introduced a new rule requiring parties to have at least 500 members and to have operated for at least 12 months to be eligible to register. This rule change was intended to reduce the number of minor parties and independent candidates.\n\n### Party preselection issues\n\nSeveral parties, including the ALP and the LP, faced preselection issues in the lead-up to the election. Some candidates were challenged by internal party opponents, while others faced allegations of corruption or misconduct.\n\n### Independents\n\nSeveral independent candidates, including Zali Steggall, Allegra Spender, and Sophie Scamps, ran in the election. These candidates were often at odds with the major parties, and their success was seen as a key factor in determining the outcome of the election.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe Australian electoral system is a preferential voting system, where voters rank candidates in order of preference. The candidate with the fewest primary votes is eliminated in each round of counting, and their preferences are distributed to other candidates.\n\n**State of electorates**\n\nPrior to the election, several electorates were redistributed following the 2021 Australian census. The redistributions resulted in changes to the boundaries of 44 electorates.\n\n### Redistribution\n\nThe redistributions were overseen by the AEC, which used data from the 2021 census to determine the boundaries of the electorates. The redistributions resulted in changes to the boundaries of 44 electorates, including the abolition of the former electorate of New England.\n\n### Election pendulum (House of Representatives)\n\nThe election pendulum is a tool used to predict the outcome of the election. The pendulum shows the number of seats that each party is expected to win, based on the current voting patterns and demographic trends.\n\n**Voter registration**\n\nAs of 2022, there were over 17 million enrolled voters in Australia, with the majority of voters enrolled in the ALP and the LP. Independent voters made up a smaller proportion of enrolled voters.\n\n**Election date**\n\nThe election was scheduled to take place on 21 May 2022.\n\n### Dissolution of parliament\n\nThe 46th Parliament was dissolved on 11 April 2022, with the election to be held on 21 May 2022.\n\n**Election timeline**\n\nThe election timeline was as follows:\n\n* 11 April 2022: Parliament dissolved\n* 21 May 2022: Election day\n* 23 May 2022: Counting of votes completed\n\n**Campaign events**\n\nThe election campaign was marked by several key events, including:\n\n* Leaders' debates: The leaders of the major parties, Anthony Albanese and Scott Morrison, participated in several debates and interviews during the campaign.\n* Campaign: The parties and candidates ran extensive campaigns, including door-knocking, advertising, and social media engagement.\n* Preferences: The parties and candidates negotiated and distributed preferences to each other, with the goal of maximizing their chances of winning seats.\n\n**Leaders' debates**\n\nThe leaders' debates were a key part of the election campaign, with Anthony Albanese and Scott Morrison participating in several debates and interviews. The debates were moderated by journalists and focused on key policy issues, including the economy, healthcare, and climate change.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe parties and candidates ran extensive campaigns, including door-knocking, advertising, and social media engagement. The campaigns were focused on key issues, including the economy, healthcare, and climate change.\n\n**Preferences**\n\nThe parties and candidates negotiated and distributed preferences to each other, with the goal of maximizing their chances of winning seats. The preferences were often complex and involved multiple parties and candidates.\n\n**Candidates**\n\nA total of 1,217 candidates ran in the election, representing 44 parties and independents.\n\n### Parties\n\nThe following parties and independents ran in the election:\n\n* Australian Labor Party (ALP)\n* Liberal Party of Australia (LP)\n* National Party of Australia (NPA)\n* Australian Greens\n* One Nation\n* United Australia Party (UAP)\n* Australian Conservatives\n* Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)\n* Reason Party\n* Animal Justice Party (AJP)\n* Sustainable Australia Party (SAP)\n* and 34 other parties and independents.\n\n**Retiring members**\n\nSeveral members of parliament retired at the 2022 election, including:\n\n* Labor: Tony Burke (Watson), Graham Perrett (Moreton), and Maria Vamvakinou (Calwell)\n* Liberal: Angus Taylor (Hume), Michael Sukkar (Deakin), and Jane Prentice (Ryan)\n* National: Michelle Landry (Capricornia) and Keith Pitt (Hinkler)\n\n### Labor\n\nThe Labor Party, led by Anthony Albanese, was the main challenger to the Liberal Party in the election.

Atomic clocks are the most accurate timekeeping devices in the world, with some versions achieving an accuracy of one second over tens of millions of years. They are used as primary time standards, and their accuracy is crucial for scientific research, navigation, and communication.\n\n# History\n\n## Definition of the Second\n\nThe concept of time is based on the idea of a cycle or a period of repetition. In ancient times, this cycle was often associated with the rotation of the Earth on its axis, resulting in day and night. However, as people began to explore and settle in different parts of the world, the need for a more precise and universal timekeeping system became apparent. In 1967, the International System of Units (SI) defined the second as the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom.\n\n## Metrology Advancements and Optical Clocks\n\nThe development of atomic clocks was a gradual process that involved significant advancements in metrology, the science of measurement. The first atomic clock was built in 1949 by physicist Isidor Rabi and his team at Columbia University, using a beam of caesium atoms to regulate its timekeeping. However, this early clock was not very accurate and was prone to errors. Over the years, scientists improved the design of atomic clocks, and in the 1950s, the first practical atomic clock was developed using a caesium beam. This was followed by the development of optical clocks, which use light to regulate their timekeeping. Optical clocks are more accurate than traditional atomic clocks and have the potential to redefine the second.\n\n## Chip-Scale Atomic Clocks\n\nIn recent years, the development of chip-scale atomic clocks has revolutionized the field of timekeeping. Chip-scale atomic clocks are small, portable, and highly accurate devices that use a chip to regulate their timekeeping. These clocks are based on the principles of atomic physics and use a tiny sample of atoms to regulate their timekeeping. Chip-scale atomic clocks have a wide range of applications, from navigation and communication to scientific research and education.\n\n# Measuring Time with Atomic Clocks\n\n## Clock Mechanism\n\nAtomic clocks work by measuring the frequency of a particular type of atom, usually caesium or rubidium, as it absorbs or emits light. The frequency of the atom is used to regulate the clock's timekeeping, ensuring that the clock keeps accurate time. The clock mechanism consists of several components, including a vacuum chamber containing the atoms, a light source to excite the atoms, and a sensor to detect the frequency of the atoms.\n\n## Tuning and Optimization\n\nTo ensure accurate timekeeping, atomic clocks require tuning and optimization. The clock's frequency is adjusted to match the frequency of the atoms, and the clock's performance is optimized to minimize errors. This process involves carefully calibrating the clock's components and adjusting its parameters to ensure accurate timekeeping.\n\n# Accuracy\n\nAtomic clocks are the most accurate timekeeping devices in the world, with some versions achieving an accuracy of one second over tens of millions of years. The accuracy of an atomic clock is determined by its stability, which refers to its ability to maintain a consistent frequency over time. Atomic clocks are used as primary time standards, and their accuracy is crucial for scientific research, navigation, and communication.\n\n# Comparing Atomic Clocks\n\n## Time Standards\n\nAtomic clocks are used as primary time standards, which means that they are the basis for defining the second.

Born in a tribal family in Odisha, she rose through the ranks of Indian politics to become the first woman from the Scheduled Tribe to occupy the highest office in the land.\n\n#Personal life\n\nDroupadi Murmu was born on 20 June 1958 in Uparbeda, a small village in Mayurbhanj district of Odisha, to Biranchi Narayan Tudu and Bidyut Prava Tudu. Her father was a farm laborer, and her mother was a homemaker. She was the eldest child and had three siblings. She was educated at the local government school and later moved to Rairangpur to complete her secondary education. After completing her education, she married Shyam Charan Murmu in 1979, and the couple has a son named Bidyut.\n\nMurmu's family has a strong tradition of social activism and community service. Her father was involved in the local Gandhian movement, and her mother was a member of the All India Kisan Sabha, a peasants' organization. This upbringing instilled in Murmu a sense of social responsibility and a commitment to public service.\n\n#Early career\n\nAfter her marriage, Murmu worked as a school teacher in Rairangpur. She was involved in various social and community activities, including the promotion of education and women's empowerment. In 1997, she became the president of the Rairangpur Block Development Committee, a local government organization responsible for the development of the block.\n\nMurmu's entry into politics began in 2002, when she was elected as a panchayat samiti member from the Rairangpur block. She was the first woman from her community to hold this position. In 2006, she was elected as the member of the Odisha Legislative Assembly from the Rairangpur constituency.\n\n#Political career\n\nMurmu's entry into the Odisha Legislative Assembly marked the beginning of her rise through the ranks of Indian politics. She served as the Minister of State for Education and Tribal Affairs in the Odisha government. During her tenure as a minister, she focused on the development of education and healthcare infrastructure in tribal areas.\n\nIn 2015, Murmu was appointed as the Governor of Jharkhand, a position she held until 2021. During her tenure as Governor, she was involved in various controversies, including the Pathalgadi movement and the religion and land bill.\n\n##Pathalgadi movement\n\nThe Pathalgadi movement was a grassroots movement that began in 2018, with the aim of promoting the rights of the indigenous people of Jharkhand. The movement involved the erection of stone plaques, known as \"pathals,\" in various villages, with the names of the tribal leaders and the laws governing their rights. Murmu was critical of the movement, stating that it was an attempt to defy the authority of the state. However, the movement drew widespread support from the tribal community, who saw it as a means of asserting their rights and challenging the dominance of the state.\n\n##Religion and land bill\n\nIn 2019, Murmu was involved in a controversy surrounding the religion and land bill. The bill, which was passed by the Jharkhand Assembly, aimed to prevent the conversion of tribal land into non-tribal land. Murmu was critical of the bill, stating that it was an attempt to provoke communal tensions. However, the bill drew widespread support from the tribal community, who saw it as a means of protecting their lands and their way of life.\n\n#Presidential campaign\n\nIn 2021, Murmu was announced as the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) candidate for the presidential election. She was the first woman from the Scheduled Tribe to be nominated for the highest office in the land. Murmu's campaign focused on her commitment to social justice and her experience as a tribal leader. She campaigned extensively across the country, meeting with various community leaders and politicians.\n\n#Presidency (2022–present)\n\nMurmu was elected as the 15th President of India on 21 July 2022, with a landslide victory. She became the first woman from the Scheduled Tribe to occupy the highest office in the land. Her presidency has focused on promoting social justice and empowering marginalized communities. She has also emphasized the importance of education and healthcare infrastructure in tribal areas.\n\n#Electoral performance\n\nMurmu's electoral performance has been impressive, with a landslide victory in the presidential election. However, her performance as Governor of Jharkhand has been more contested, with criticism surrounding her handling of the Pathalgadi movement and the religion and land bill.\n\n#State honours\n\nMurmu has received numerous state honours, including the Padma Shri, India's fourth-highest civilian award. She has also been awarded the Mahatma Gandhi National Fellowship for her contributions to social justice and tribal empowerment.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of Governors of Jharkhand\n* List of Presidents of India\n* Bharatiya Janata Party\n* Scheduled Tribe\n\n#Notes\n\n* This article is for informational purposes only and does not reflect the author's opinion or views.\n\n#References\n\n* Please note that this article does not include any references, as per the requirements.\n\n#Further reading\n\n* \"Droupadi Murmu: A Profile\" by The Hindu\n* \"Droupadi Murmu Elected as India's 15th President\" by The New York Times\n* \"Droupadi Murmu's Rise to the Top\" by The Indian Express\n\n#External links\n\n* Official website of the President of India\n* Official website of the Governor of Jharkhand", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Droupadi_Murmu\" following this outline:\n\n#Personal life\n#Early career\n#Political career\n#Governor of Jharkhand (2015–2021)\n##Pathalgadi movement\n##Religion and land bill\n#Presidential campaign\n#Presidency (2022–present)\n#Electoral performance\n#State honours\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
