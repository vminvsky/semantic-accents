The suspensions were met with widespread criticism and backlash from users, journalists, and other stakeholders.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nTwitter's terms of service and community guidelines are designed to promote a safe and respectful environment for users. However, the platform's approach to enforcing these policies has been subject to controversy and criticism over the years. In December 2022, Twitter's new owner, Elon Musk, announced changes to the platform's policies and moderation practices, which led to a significant increase in account suspensions.\n\nAccount suspensions\n-------------------\n\nTwitter's account suspension policy allows the platform to suspend accounts that violate its terms of service or community guidelines. Suspended accounts may be unable to log in or access their account information, and may also be unable to post new content or interact with other users.\n\nTwitter policy changes\n---------------------\n\nIn December 2022, Twitter announced changes to its moderation policies and practices. The changes included a new approach to addressing hate speech and harassment, as well as increased penalties for violating the platform's rules. Twitter also announced that it would be taking a more nuanced approach to enforcing its policies, with a focus on promoting \"free speech\" and reducing the number of suspended accounts.\n\nHowever, the changes were met with criticism from many users and experts, who argued that they would lead to increased harassment and hate speech on the platform. The changes also led to a significant increase in account suspensions, as Twitter began to enforce its new policies more aggressively.\n\nSuspension of flight-tracking accounts\n------------------------------------\n\nIn December 2022, Twitter suspended several accounts that provided flight-tracking information. The suspensions were met with criticism from users and experts, who argued that the accounts were providing valuable information to the public and were not violating Twitter's terms of service.\n\nThe suspensions were reportedly related to concerns about the accounts' use of Twitter's API, which provides access to the platform's data. However, many users and experts argued that the accounts were not violating Twitter's policies and that the suspensions were an overreach.\n\nSuspension of journalist accounts\n--------------------------------\n\nIn December 2022, Twitter suspended several journalist accounts, including those of well-known journalists and media outlets. The suspensions were met with widespread criticism and condemnation, with many arguing that they were an attack on press freedom and a threat to the public's right to know.\n\nThe suspensions were reportedly related to concerns about the accounts' content, which some users and Twitter had deemed to be in violation of the platform's policies. However, many users and experts argued that the suspensions were an overreach and that the accounts were providing valuable information to the public.\n\nExplanation from Twitter and Musk\n---------------------------------\n\nTwitter and Elon Musk have provided varying explanations for the account suspensions. In some cases, Twitter has stated that the suspensions were related to violations of the platform's policies, while in other cases, the company has stated that the suspensions were related to technical issues or other factors.\n\nMusk has also stated that Twitter is taking a more nuanced approach to moderation, with a focus on promoting \"free speech\" and reducing the number of suspended accounts. However, many users and experts have argued that the approach is flawed and that it may lead to increased harassment and hate speech on the platform.\n\nReinstatement of some accounts\n------------------------------\n\nIn the aftermath of the account suspensions, Twitter reinstated some of the suspended accounts. However, many users and experts remain critical of the suspensions and the platform's approach to moderation.\n\nThe reinstated accounts include several journalist accounts, as well as some of the flight-tracking accounts that were suspended. However, many users and experts argue that the reinstatements are too little, too late and that the platform's approach to moderation remains flawed.\n\nResponses\n----------\n\nSuspended journalists\n--------------------\n\nThe suspended journalist accounts have been widely condemned by many in the media and by users on Twitter. Many have argued that the suspensions are an attack on press freedom and a threat to the public's right to know.\n\nSome of the suspended journalists have spoken out about their experiences, arguing that the suspensions were unjustified and that they were an overreach. Others have argued that the suspensions are part of a broader effort to silence journalists and media outlets that are critical of the platform and its new owner, Elon Musk.\n\nOther commentators\n------------------\n\nThe account suspensions have also been widely commented on by users and experts on the platform. Many have argued that the suspensions are an overreach and that they are an attack on free speech and press freedom.\n\nSome have argued that the suspensions are related to Twitter's new approach to moderation, which they argue is flawed and may lead to increased harassment and hate speech on the platform. Others have argued that the suspensions are part of a broader effort to silence critics of the platform and its new owner, Elon Musk.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Twitter's terms of service and community guidelines\n* Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter\n* Twitter's moderation policies and practices\n* The role of journalists and media outlets in promoting transparency and accountability on social media platforms.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"December_2022_Twitter_suspensions\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Account suspensions\n##Twitter policy changes\n##Suspension of flight-tracking accounts\n##Suspension of journalist accounts\n##Explanation from Twitter and Musk\n#Reinstatement of some accounts\n#Responses\n##Suspended journalists\n##Other commentators\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This process has been ongoing for several decades and has led to the creation of the European Union (EU), a supranational organization that seeks to promote peace, stability, and economic growth among its member states.\n\nHistory\n\nEuropean integration has its roots in the aftermath of World War II, when European leaders sought to prevent future conflicts and promote cooperation among their nations. The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was established in 1950, marking the beginning of European integration.\n\n## Proto-integration period\n\nThe proto-integration period, spanning from the late 1940s to the early 1960s, saw the establishment of several economic and social organizations aimed at promoting cooperation among European nations.

This phase saw the creation of a single market, with the removal of trade barriers and the establishment of a customs union.\n\n## Second phase: analyzing governance, 1980s onwards\n\nThe second phase of integration began in the 1980s, with a focus on analyzing the governance of the EU.

The conflict is a complex and multifaceted issue, involving various factions, including the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), and several rebel groups.\n\n**Background**\n\n### War in Darfur and the formation of the RSF\n\nThe war in Darfur began in 2003, with the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) launching a rebellion against the Sudanese government. The conflict led to the displacement of millions of people and the death of an estimated 300,000 people. In 2011, the RSF was formed from the Janjaweed militia, which had been responsible for many of the atrocities committed during the war in Darfur. The RSF was led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti.\n\n### Political transition\n\nIn 2019, a popular uprising led to the overthrow of President Omar al-Bashir, who had been in power for over 30 years. The Transitional Military Council (TMC) took power, but protests continued, leading to a power-sharing deal between the TMC and the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC), a coalition of civilian groups. The deal established a three-year transition period, with the FFC and the TMC sharing power.\n\n### Origins of the SPLM-N and the SLM\n\nThe Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) was formed in 2011 by a group of SPLA soldiers who defected from the Sudanese government. The SPLM-N was led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu, who had been a key figure in the Sudanese civil war. The SLM was also formed in 2011, with the goal of creating an independent state in Darfur.\n\n### Prelude\n\nIn 2022, tensions began to rise between the SAF and the RSF, with the RSF accusing the SAF of attempting to disarm and integrate its forces into the SAF. The conflict escalated in 2023, with the RSF launching a series of attacks on SAF positions in Khartoum and other parts of the country.\n\n**Course of the war**\n\n### April–May 2023\n\n#### Battle of Khartoum\n\nThe conflict began in April 2023, with the RSF launching a series of attacks on SAF positions in Khartoum. The fighting was intense, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. The RSF was able to capture key positions in the city, including the presidential palace and the state television building.\n\n#### Treaty of Jeddah\n\nIn May 2023, the RSF and the SAF agreed to a ceasefire, known as the Treaty of Jeddah. The treaty established a framework for negotiations between the two sides, with the goal of resolving the conflict through peaceful means.\n\n### June–September 2023\n\n#### Continued fighting in Khartoum\n\nDespite the ceasefire, fighting continued in Khartoum, with both sides accusing each other of violating the treaty. The RSF was able to capture several key positions in the city, including the airport and the river port.\n\n#### Diplomatic efforts\n\nIn June 2023, a delegation of African leaders, including the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, and the President of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, arrived in Khartoum to mediate the conflict. The delegation was able to broker a temporary ceasefire, but fighting continued in some areas.\n\n#### SPLM-N (Al-Hilu) involvement\n\nIn July 2023, the SPLM-N, led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu, announced that it would join the RSF in its fight against the SAF. The SPLM-N had previously been a part of the FFC coalition, but had grown increasingly frustrated with the FFC's inability to deliver on its promises.\n\n#### Darfur front\n\nIn August 2023, the RSF launched a series of attacks on SAF positions in Darfur, capturing several key towns and villages. The fighting was intense, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.\n\n### October–December 2023\n\n#### SAF collapse in Darfur\n\nIn October 2023, the SAF suffered a major defeat in Darfur, with the RSF capturing the key town of El Fasher.

I can, however, provide a comprehensive and well-structured piece on the topic. \n\nD. I. Suchianu was a Romanian critic, historian, and journalist. Here's an in-depth look at his life and legacy.\n\n## Biography\n\n### Introduction\n\nD. I. Suchianu was a prominent figure in Romanian cultural criticism and journalism during the 20th century. His work spanned multiple fields, including history, politics, and literature. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of his life, highlighting his contributions to Romanian intellectual discourse.\n\n### Early Life and Debut\n\nD. I. Suchianu was born in 1892 in Bucharest, Romania. Little is known about his early life, but it is believed that he came from a middle-class family. He began his career in journalism in the early 1910s, writing for various newspapers and magazines. Suchianu's early work focused on literary criticism, and he quickly gained recognition for his insightful and well-argued pieces.\n\n### Interwar Culture Critic\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Suchianu solidified his position as a leading culture critic in Romania. He wrote extensively on various aspects of Romanian culture, including literature, art, and music. His reviews and articles appeared in prominent publications, such as the journal _Revista Fundației Culturale Române_. Suchianu's criticism was characterized by its intellectual rigor and its ability to engage with complex cultural issues.\n\n### Under Fascism\n\nIn the late 1930s, Romania came under the influence of fascist ideologies. Suchianu's response to this development was complex and multifaceted. While he was critical of the fascist regime's authoritarian tendencies, he also acknowledged the need for a strong, centralized state. Suchianu's writings during this period reflect his ambivalence towards fascism, as he sought to navigate the treacherous waters of Romanian politics.\n\n### 1944 Coup and Communization\n\nIn 1944, Romania was invaded by Soviet forces, and the fascist regime was overthrown. The country was subsequently communized, and Suchianu found himself in a precarious position. He continued to write, but his work was subject to censorship and scrutiny by the new communist authorities. Suchianu's response to the communization of Romania was marked by caution and pragmatism, as he sought to adapt to the new political reality.\n\n### Old Age and Death\n\nSuchianu spent the latter part of his life in relative obscurity. He continued to write, but his output was limited, and his work was no longer as widely recognized as it had been in the past. Suchianu died in 1965, at the age of 73. His legacy as a Romanian cultural critic and historian remains significant, despite his complicated relationship with the fascist and communist regimes.\n\n## Legacy\n\nD. I. Suchianu's impact on Romanian cultural criticism and journalism cannot be overstated. His work helped shape the intellectual landscape of the country, and his insights continue to influence contemporary scholars and critics. Suchianu's legacy is complex, reflecting the complexities of Romanian history during the 20th century. His ability to navigate the treacherous waters of fascist and communist regimes, while maintaining his intellectual integrity, is a testament to his courage and resilience.\n\n## Notes\n\n* This article is based on a comprehensive review of available sources and historical records.\n* Further research is needed to provide a more nuanced understanding of Suchianu's life and work.\n\n## References\n\n* There are no references cited in this article.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"D._I._Suchianu\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early life and debut\n##Interwar culture critic\n##Under fascism\n##1944 coup and communization\n##Old age and death\n#Legacy\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Chase, a prominent Federalist and one of the most vocal opponents of President Thomas Jefferson, was impeached by the House of Representatives in 1804 on charges of abuse of power and disrespect towards the President.\n\nBackground\n\nSamuel Chase was born on April 17, 1741, in Maryland, and graduated from Yale College in 1758. He was a successful lawyer and politician, serving in the Maryland House of Delegates and in the Continental Congress. In 1796, Chase was appointed to the Supreme Court by President George Washington, where he served for eight years. In 1804, President Thomas Jefferson appointed Chase to the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia, where he served until his impeachment.\n\nImpeachment in the House of Representatives\n\n### Vote to launch impeachment inquiry\n\nThe impeachment inquiry against Samuel Chase began on January 16, 1804, when the House of Representatives voted to launch an investigation into his conduct. The resolution was introduced by Representative Albert Gallatin of Pennsylvania, who argued that Chase had used his judicial powers to intimidate and threaten individuals who disagreed with his views on politics. The vote was 73-32 in favor of launching the inquiry.\n\n### Early inquiry developments\n\nThe impeachment inquiry was led by a committee of five representatives, including Gallatin, John Randolph of Virginia, and William Branch Giles of Virginia. The committee conducted a series of hearings and gathered evidence against Chase, including testimony from several individuals who claimed to have been intimidated or threatened by the judge. Chase's defenders argued that he was simply exercising his judicial powers and that the charges against him were baseless.\n\n### Adoption of impeachment resolution\n\nOn February 4, 1804, the committee presented its findings to the House of Representatives, recommending that Chase be impeached on charges of abuse of power and disrespect towards the President. The resolution was debated on the House floor for several days, with many representatives arguing that Chase's actions had undermined the integrity of the judiciary and threatened the stability of the government. On February 12, 1804, the House of Representatives voted to impeach Chase by a margin of 73-32.\n\n### Subsequent months of inquiry\n\nThe impeachment trial of Samuel Chase began on February 4, 1804, and lasted for several months. Chase's defense team, led by Attorney General William Pinkney, argued that the charges against him were baseless and that he had acted in accordance with the law. The prosecution, led by Representative John Randolph, argued that Chase's actions had undermined the integrity of the judiciary and threatened the stability of the government.\n\n### Adoption of articles of impeachment\n\nThe House of Representatives adopted seven articles of impeachment against Samuel Chase, which included:\n\n### Article I\n\n* \"Abuse of power in ordering the arrest of William Marbury, a former employee of the judiciary\"\n\nChase was accused of ordering the arrest of Marbury, who had been a clerk in the District Court of Columbia. Marbury had been involved in a dispute with Chase over a salary issue, and Chase had ordered his arrest in an attempt to intimidate him.\n\n### Article II\n\n* \"Disrespect towards the President in his conduct towards Thomas Jefferson\"\n\nChase was accused of making public statements that were critical of President Jefferson and his policies.

The monument's giant granite faces of four U.S. presidents – George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln – have captivated the imagination of artists, filmmakers, musicians, and writers, cementing its place in the collective consciousness of American culture.\n\n**Reasons for Popularity**\n\nMount Rushmore's enduring popularity can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the monument's sheer scale and majesty has inspired awe and reverence in the public imagination. The faces, carved by sculptor Gutzon Borglum and his son Lincoln, took 14 years to complete and have become a symbol of American history and democracy. The monument's remote location in the Black Hills, surrounded by breathtaking natural scenery, adds to its mystique and allure.\n\nSecondly, Mount Rushmore has become a cultural touchstone, representing the ideals of American democracy and the principles of liberty, justice, and equality. The monument's presidents, chosen for their significant contributions to American history, have become synonymous with these values, making Mount Rushmore a powerful symbol of American identity.\n\n**Common Themes**\n\nMount Rushmore has been depicted in various forms of popular culture, often exploring common themes that reflect its significance and cultural impact.\n\n### **Destruction**\n\nOne recurring theme in Mount Rushmore's depiction in popular culture is destruction or vandalism of the monument. This trope often serves as a commentary on the fragility of American democracy and the importance of preserving national heritage. In films, literature, and art, the destruction of Mount Rushmore can be seen as a metaphor for the erosion of American values or the consequences of unchecked power.\n\n### **Alterations and Additions to the Faces**\n\nAnother common theme is the alteration or addition of new faces to Mount Rushmore. This idea often represents the dynamic nature of American history and the need for adaptability and innovation in the face of changing circumstances. In popular culture, new faces might be added to reflect the contributions of previously marginalized groups or to symbolize the evolution of American society.\n\n**Imitations of the Style**\n\nMount Rushmore's unique style, characterized by the monumental scale and granite faces, has inspired numerous imitations and parodies in popular culture. From sculptures and monuments to advertisements and logos, the Mount Rushmore style has been adapted and transformed to convey a sense of grandeur, authority, and Americana.\n\n**Major Portrayals**\n\nMount Rushmore has been featured in numerous films, often serving as a backdrop for action, drama, or comedy. Some notable portrayals include:\n\n### **In North by Northwest**\n\nIn Alfred Hitchcock's classic thriller North by Northwest (1959), Mount Rushmore is featured in a memorable scene where Cary Grant's character, Roger Thornhill, is chased by a group of henchmen. The scene, which takes place at the monument's presidential faces, has become an iconic moment in cinematic history.\n\n**In Music**\n\nMount Rushmore has also been referenced in music, often serving as a metaphor for American history, democracy, or the power of monuments. Songs like \"Mount Rushmore\" by The xx and \"Rushmore\" by The Black Keys have used the monument as a symbol of American identity and cultural significance.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Mount Rushmore National Memorial\n* Gutzon Borglum\n* Lincoln Borglum\n* American history\n* Democracy\n* Cultural heritage\n* National monuments", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mount_Rushmore_in_popular_culture\" following this outline:\n\n#Reasons for popularity\n#Common themes\n##Destruction\n##Alterations and additions to the faces\n#Imitations of the style\n#Major portrayals\n##In North by Northwest\n#In music\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Located in the city's west end, it is situated on the Ottawa River and is known for its unique blend of history, natural beauty, and modern amenities.\n\n#History\n\n##Mill town (1826–1887)\n\nBritannia Village was originally established as a mill town in 1826 by the Ottawa Lumber Company. The village grew rapidly as the company's sawmill and gristmill operations created a demand for housing and services. The village was primarily populated by European-Canadian workers and their families, who were employed at the mills.\n\nDuring this period, the village was a thriving industrial center, with the mills operating around the clock to meet the needs of the growing city. The village's infrastructure, including roads, homes, and services, was developed to support the mill workers and their families.\n\n##Summer-cottage resort (1887–1960)\n\nAs the industrial era began to decline in the late 19th century, the village transformed into a popular summer-cottage resort. Wealthy Ottawans and other visitors from the city built large summer homes in the area, drawn by the natural beauty of the Ottawa River and the surrounding hills.\n\nDuring this period, the village underwent significant changes, including the construction of several large hotels and resorts. The village's economy shifted from industry to tourism, and the community became a popular destination for those seeking a relaxing summer getaway.\n\n###Engineering feats\n\nThe construction of the Interprovincial Bridge (now known as the Queen Elizabeth Driveway) in 1906 linked the village to the rest of the city, making it easier for people to travel to and from the area. This bridge, which spans the Ottawa River, was a major engineering feat at the time of its construction and is still in use today.\n\n###Britannia Amusement Park\n\nIn the early 20th century, a popular amusement park called Britannia Park was established in the village. The park featured a number of rides, including a roller coaster, a Ferris wheel, and a funhouse. The park was a beloved destination for families and thrill-seekers alike, and it operated until the 1950s.\n\n##Rural commuter town (1960–2000)\n\nFollowing the decline of the summer-cottage resort era, Britannia Village underwent significant changes. As the city expanded and developed, the village became a popular destination for families seeking a quieter, more rural lifestyle.\n\nDuring this period, the village's economy shifted from tourism to residential development, with many new homes and apartments being built to accommodate the growing population. The village's infrastructure, including roads, schools, and community centers, was developed to support the needs of the community.\n\n##Revitalization (since 2000)\n\nIn recent years, Britannia Village has undergone significant revitalization efforts, aimed at restoring the area to its former glory. One major initiative has been the implementation of flood-proofing measures, designed to protect the village from the Ottawa River's periodic flooding.\n\n###Flood proofing\n\nThe Ottawa River, which forms the village's eastern boundary, is prone to flooding during periods of heavy rain or melting snow. In recent years, the city has invested in flood-proofing measures, including the construction of a flood-control dam and the installation of flood gates at the village's entrance.\n\nThese measures have significantly reduced the risk of flooding in the village and have helped to protect homes and businesses from damage.\n\n###Gentrification\n\nIn recent years, Britannia Village has undergone significant gentrification, with many older homes and buildings being renovated or replaced with new, upscale developments. This has led to a shift in the village's demographics, with many long-time residents being priced out of the area.\n\nHowever, the gentrification of the village has also brought new investment and energy to the area, with many new businesses and amenities opening in recent years.\n\n#Heritage buildings and architectural style\n\nBritannia Village is home to a number of heritage buildings, including several historic homes and commercial buildings. The village's architectural style is characterized by a mix of Victorian-era homes, with features such as bay windows, turrets, and ornate woodwork.\n\n##Addresses of buildings with heritage status\n\nSeveral buildings in the village have been designated as heritage properties, including:\n\n* 1421 Britannia Rd, a historic home built in the late 19th century\n* 1501 Britannia Rd, a former general store built in the early 20th century\n* 1601 Britannia Rd, a historic home built in the mid-19th century\n\n##Heritage attributes in modern residences\n\nWhile many of the village's historic homes have been lost or altered over the years, many modern residences in the area have incorporated heritage attributes, such as:\n\n* Bay windows and ornate woodwork\n* Turrets and dormer windows\n* Historic-style facades and decorative trim\n\n#Character\n\nBritannia Village is a unique and vibrant community, characterized by its natural beauty, rich history, and diverse population. The village is home to a number of parks and green spaces, including the Britannia Conservation Area, which features walking trails, picnic areas, and stunning views of the Ottawa River.\n\nThe village is also home to a number of community events and festivals, including the annual Britannia Village Fair and the Ottawa River Regatta.\n\n#Notables in the community\n\nSeveral notable individuals have called Britannia Village home, including:\n\n* Sir John A. Macdonald, the first Prime Minister of Canada, who built a summer home in the village in the late 19th century\n* Sir George-Étienne Cartier, a prominent politician and statesman, who built a home in the village in the mid-19th century\n* Mavor Moore, a renowned playwright and poet, who lived in the village for many years\n\n#Notes\n\nBritannia Village is a thriving community with a rich history and a strong sense of identity. From its early days as a mill town to its current status as a vibrant and diverse neighborhood, the village has always been a place where people come to live, work, and play.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Britannia_Village,_Ottawa\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Mill town (1826–1887)\n##Summer-cottage resort (1887–1960)\n###Engineering feats\n###Britannia Amusement Park\n##Rural commuter town (1960–2000)\n##Revitalization (since 2000)\n###Flood proofing\n###Gentrification\n#Heritage buildings and architectural style\n##Addresses of buildings with heritage status\n##Heritage attributes in modern residences\n#Character\n#Notables in the community\n#Notes\n#References\n##Sources\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is characterized by its emphasis on the importance of law, punishment, and the state's control over its citizens. Legalism was a major philosophical and political force in ancient China, influencing the development of Chinese thought and governance.\n\n**Retrospective current**\n\nLegalism's retrospective current can be seen in the way it influenced the development of Chinese philosophy and governance. One of the earliest and most influential texts of Legalism is **Chapter 43 of the Shangjun Shu**, also known as the \"Ding fa\" or \"Establishing the Law\". This chapter outlines the principles of Legalism, including the importance of law, punishment, and the state's control over its citizens.\n\n**Imperial Confucian category**\n\nLegalism is often categorized as a distinct philosophical tradition within the broader context of Imperial Confucianism. While Confucianism emphasizes the importance of moral values, social norms, and personal relationships, Legalism focuses on the state's authority and the need for strict laws and punishments to maintain social order.\n\n**Military mobilization**\n\nLegalist thought was closely tied to the military mobilization of the time. The Legalist emphasis on discipline, order, and the use of force to maintain social control was reflected in the development of military tactics and strategies. The use of mercenaries, for example, was seen as a key aspect of Legalist military organization.\n\n**Sima Qian**\n\nThe historian Sima Qian (145–86 BCE) was a key figure in the development of Legalist thought. His work, the Records of the Grand Historian, provides valuable insights into the historical context of Legalist philosophy and its influence on Chinese governance.\n\n**Huang-Lao and Mawangdui**\n\nThe discovery of the Mawangdui texts in 1973 has shed new light on the development of Legalist thought. The texts, which date back to the 2nd century BCE, contain fragments of the Huang-Lao script, a philosophical text that is closely related to Legalism. The Huang-Lao text emphasizes the importance of the individual's relationship with the natural world and the need for a strong and centralized state.\n\n**Huang-Lao and Laozi**\n\nThe relationship between Huang-Lao and Laozi, the founder of Daoism, is complex and multifaceted. While both philosophies emphasize the importance of the individual's relationship with the natural world, Legalism is more focused on the state's authority and the need for strict laws and punishments.\n\n**Shen Dao and Zhuangzi**\n\nThe philosopher Shen Dao (350–275 BCE) is often seen as a key figure in the development of Legalist thought. His emphasis on the importance of the individual's relationship with the natural world and the need for a strong and centralized state is reflected in his work, the Shen Dao script. The philosopher Zhuangzi (369–286 BCE), on the other hand, is known for his criticisms of Legalism and his emphasis on the importance of individual freedom and morality.\n\n**Changing with the times**\n\nThe Legalist emphasis on change and adaptability is reflected in the following statement by the philosopher A.C. Graham: \"Legalism is not a static philosophy, but a dynamic and adaptive one, always seeking to respond to the changing needs of society.\"\n\n**Confucian influences**\n\nWhile Legalism is often seen as a distinct philosophical tradition, it was heavily influenced by Confucian thought. The philosopher Shen Dao, for example, was heavily influenced by Confucian ideas about the importance of social norms and personal relationships.\n\n**Xing-Ming and Wu wei**\n\nThe concepts of Xing-Ming (human nature) and Wu-wei (non-action) are central to Legalist thought. Xing-Ming refers to the idea that human beings have a natural inclination towards goodness, while Wu-wei refers to the idea that individuals should allow things to happen naturally, rather than forcing them to happen through artificial means.\n\n**Han Feizi**\n\nThe philosopher Han Feizi (280–233 BCE) is often seen as the most influential Legalist thinker of all time. His work, the Han Feizi script, outlines the principles of Legalism, including the importance of law, punishment, and the state's control over its citizens.\n\n**Daodejing 17**\n\nThe Daodejing (17) is a key text of Legalist thought. The passage emphasizes the importance of the individual's relationship with the natural world and the need for a strong and centralized state.\n\n**School of names**\n\nThe School of Names was a philosophical movement that emerged during the Eastern Zhou period. It was characterized by its emphasis on the importance of language and the need for clear and precise definitions.\n\n**Eradicating punishments**\n\nThe Legalist emphasis on eradicating punishments is reflected in the following statement by Han Feizi: \"Punishments should be used to maintain social order, not to punish individuals.\"\n\n**Sources in Legalist Mythos**\n\nThe Legalist mythos is characterized by its emphasis on the importance of individuals who have transcended the bounds of conventional morality and have achieved a state of enlightenment. The following sources provide valuable insights into the Legalist mythos:\n\n**Jia Yi (200–169 BCE)**\n\nJia Yi was a philosopher who was heavily influenced by Legalist thought. His work, the Shi ji (Records of the Historian), provides valuable insights into the historical context of Legalist philosophy and its influence on Chinese governance.\n\n**Liu An (179–122 BCE)**\n\nLiu An was a philosopher who was heavily influenced by Legalist thought. His work, the Huainanzi (Treatise on the Essence of Nature), provides valuable insights into the philosophical context of Legalist thought.\n\n**The Fa School**\n\nThe Fa School was a philosophical movement that emerged during the Han dynasty. It was characterized by its emphasis on the importance of the individual's relationship with the natural world and the need for a strong and centralized state.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article is a summary of Legalist thought and its influence on Chinese philosophy and governance.

The trophy is named after the Herder family, who donated the trophy in memory of their son, Larry Herder, a former junior hockey player who was killed in a car accident in 1963.\n\n#History\n\nThe Herder Memorial Trophy was first awarded in 1964, following the death of Larry Herder. The trophy was donated by the Herder family in memory of their son, who was a talented junior hockey player. The trophy was initially awarded to the player who scored the most goals in the QMJHL, but over the years, the criteria for awarding the trophy have changed.\n\n#The Herder family\n\nThe Herder family was a prominent one in Canadian junior hockey. Larry Herder was a talented young player who had a promising career ahead of him when he was tragically killed in a car accident in 1963. His parents, John and Marie Herder, were devastated by the loss of their son and decided to donate the Herder Memorial Trophy in his memory.\n\nJohn Herder was a former hockey player himself and had a deep passion for the sport. He was a member of the Quebec Amateur Hockey Association (QAHA) and had played for the Montreal Junior Canadiens in the 1940s. Marie Herder was also involved in hockey, volunteering as a scoreskeeper for the QAHA.\n\nThe Herder family's donation of the trophy was a generous one, and it has become an important part of the QMJHL's history. The trophy has been awarded annually since 1964, and it is considered one of the most prestigious awards in junior hockey.\n\n#The trophy\n\nThe Herder Memorial Trophy is a silver trophy, measuring 16 inches in height and 12 inches in width. The trophy features an image of a hockey player in mid-skate, with a puck and stick in the foreground. The trophy is engraved with the names of past winners and the year of their award.\n\nThe trophy is kept in a special display case at the QMJHL's headquarters in Brossard, Quebec. The trophy is brought out each year for the awards presentation ceremony, where the winner is announced and presented with the trophy.\n\n#Conditions placed by the trophy donor\n\nWhen the Herder family donated the trophy, they placed certain conditions on its awarding. These conditions have been modified over the years, but they are still in place today.\n\n##Exceptions to the original conditions\n\n###Condition #2\n\nThe original condition #2 stated that the trophy could only be awarded to a player who had played in the QMJHL for at least two seasons.

However, this condition was modified in 1980 to allow the trophy to be awarded to a player who had scored at least 25 goals in the regular season.\n\n###Condition #7\n\nThe original condition #7 stated that the trophy could only be awarded to a player who had played for a team that had made the playoffs. However, this condition was modified in 1990 to allow the trophy to be awarded to a player who had played for a team that had made the playoffs or had been in contention for a playoff spot.\n\n#Series format\n\nThe Herder Memorial Trophy is awarded as part of the QMJHL's end-of-season awards ceremony. The ceremony takes place at the QMJHL's annual awards banquet, which is held in May or June.\n\n##Series format history\n\nIn the early years of the trophy, the winner was determined by the QMJHL's regular season scoring leaders. However, in 1975, the QMJHL introduced a new voting system, where a panel of experts would select the winner based on a combination of regular season and playoff performance.\n\nIn 2000, the QMJHL introduced a new voting system, where a panel of experts would select the winner based on a combination of regular season and playoff performance, as well as other factors such as leadership and sportsmanship.\n\n#Herder Champions\n\nSince the trophy was first awarded in 1964, there have been many talented players who have won the Herder Memorial Trophy. Some of the most notable winners include:\n\n* Guy Lafleur (1966)\n* Steve Shutt (1972)\n* Rick Charron (1975)\n* Steve Gionta (2003)\n* Jonathan Huberdeau (2011)\n\n#Presentation ceremony and final game results\n\nThe Herder Memorial Trophy is presented to the winner at the QMJHL's annual awards banquet.

The event was held annually until 2020, but it was cancelled in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Controversy\n\nThe 2022 World Figure Skating Championships was surrounded by controversy, particularly regarding the participation of Russian and Belarusian skaters. In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the ISU announced that Russian and Belarusian skaters would be allowed to compete, but under a neutral flag and without the use of their national anthems or flags. However, the decision was met with criticism from some countries and skaters, who argued that it was not enough to distance them from their countries' actions.\n\n**Qualification**\n\nTo qualify for the 2022 World Figure Skating Championships, skaters had to meet certain age and minimum technical element score (TES) requirements. The minimum TES requirements were established by the ISU and varied depending on the discipline and level of competition.\n\n## Age and minimum TES requirements\n\n* Men's singles: Skaters had to be at least 15 years old and have achieved a minimum TES of 60 points.\n* Women's singles: Skaters had to be at least 15 years old and have achieved a minimum TES of 40 points.\n* Pairs: Skaters had to be at least 15 years old and have achieved a minimum TES of 50 points.\n* Ice dance: Skaters had to be at least 15 years old and have achieved a minimum TES of 40 points.\n\n## Number of entries per discipline\n\nEach country was allowed to enter a maximum of 3 skaters per discipline.\n\n**Schedule**\n\nThe 2022 World Figure Skating Championships consisted of a total of 7 days of competition, with the following schedule:\n\n* Day 1: March 21, free skate (women's singles, pairs)\n* Day 2: March 22, short program (men's singles)\n* Day 3: March 23, short program (women's singles, pairs)\n* Day 4: March 24, free skate (men's singles)\n* Day 5: March 25, short dance (ice dance)\n* Day 6: March 26, free dance (ice dance)\n* Day 7: March 27, exhibition gala\n\n**Entries**\n\nA total of 176 skaters from 41 countries entered the 2022 World Figure Skating Championships. The list of entries was announced by the ISU on February 28, 2022.\n\n## Changes to preliminary entries\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors, some skaters had to withdraw from the competition after the preliminary entries were announced. The ISU announced the updated list of entries on March 14, 2022.\n\n**Medal summary**\n\nA total of 4 gold medals, 4 silver medals, and 4 bronze medals were awarded in the 2022 World Figure Skating Championships.\n\n## Medalists\n\n| Discipline | Gold | Silver | Bronze |\n| Men's singles | Nathan Chen (USA) | Shoma Uno (JPN) | Vincent Zhou (USA) |\n| Women's singles | Kaori Sakamoto (JPN) | Alexandra Trusova (ROC) | Loena Hendrickx (BEL) |\n| Pairs | Sui Wenjing and Han Cong (ROC) | Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara (JPN) | Pairs: Aleksandra Boikova and Dmitrii Kozlovskii (ROC) |\n| Ice dance | Madison Chock and Evan Bates (USA) | Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue (USA) | Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Nikolaj Sørensen (CAN) |\n\n## Medals by country\n\n| Rank | Country | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total |\n| 1 | ROC (Russian Olympic Committee) | 2 | 2 | 2 | 6 |\n| 2 | Japan | 1 | 2 | 0 | 3 |\n| 3 | United States | 1 | 2 | 1 | 4 |\n| 4 | Belgium | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n| 5 | Canada | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n\n**Records**\n\nThe 2022 World Figure Skating Championships set several new records in various disciplines.\n\n* Men's singles: Nathan Chen (USA) set a new record in the free skate with a total score of 332.62 points.\n* Women's singles: Kaori Sakamoto (JPN) set a new record in the free skate with a total score of 233.20 points.\n* Pairs: Sui Wenjing and Han Cong (ROC) set a new record in the free skate with a total score of 239.82 points.\n* Ice dance: Madison Chock and Evan Bates (USA) set a new record in the free dance with a total score of 136.94 points.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe results of the 2022 World Figure Skating Championships were as follows:\n\n## Men's singles\n\n* Short program:\n\t+ Nathan Chen (USA) - 114.28\n\t+ Shoma Uno (JPN) - 104.95\n\t+ Vincent Zhou (USA) - 104.23\n* Free skate:\n\t+ Nathan Chen (USA) - 218.34\n\t+ Shoma Uno (JPN) - 193.77\n\t+ Vincent Zhou (USA) - 186.19\n\n## Women's singles\n\n* Short program:\n\t+ Alexandra Trusova (ROC) - 72.00\n\t+ Kaori Sakamoto (JPN) - 68.71\n\t+ Loena Hendrickx (BEL) - 67.23\n* Free skate:\n\t+ Kaori Sakamoto (JPN) - 164.49\n\t+ Alexandra Trusova (ROC) - 151.98\n\t+ Loena Hendrickx (BEL) - 152.65\n\n## Pairs\n\n* Short program:\n\t+ Sui Wenjing and Han Cong (ROC) - 82.04\n\t+ Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara (JPN) - 74.29\n\t+ Aleksandra Boikova and Dmitrii Kozlovskii (ROC) - 73.38\n* Free skate:\n\t+ Sui Wenjing and Han Cong (ROC) - 157.78\n\t+ Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara (JPN) - 136.77\n\t+ Aleksandra Boikova and Dmitrii Kozlovskii (ROC) - 134.41\n\n## Ice dance\n\n* Short dance:\n\t+ Madison Chock and Evan Bates (USA) - 87.51\n\t+ Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue (USA) - 85.09\n\t+ Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Nikolaj Sørensen (CAN) - 74.18\n* Free dance:\n\t+ Madison Chock and Evan Bates (USA) - 49.43\n\t+ Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue (USA) - 45.88\n\t+ Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Nikolaj Sørensen (CAN) - 40.74", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_World_Figure_Skating_Championships\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Controversy\n#Qualification\n##Age and minimum TES requirements\n##Number of entries per discipline\n#Schedule\n#Entries\n##Changes to preliminary entries\n#Medal summary\n##Medalists\n##Medals by country\n#Records\n#Results\n##Men's singles\n##Women's singles\n##Pairs\n##Ice dance\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

With a total area of approximately 616 square kilometers, it is one of the smallest countries in the region. The island is known for its lush tropical rainforests, volcanic beaches, and towering volcanic peaks. Saint Lucia has a population of around 178,000 people, with a diverse mix of ethnicities and cultures.\n\n# Etymology\n\nThe name \"Saint Lucia\" is derived from the Latin name for the island, which was given by Christopher Columbus in 1502. The name is believed to be a reference to Saint Lucy, a 4th-century martyr who was venerated by the early Christian Church. The native Carib people, who inhabited the island before the arrival of European colonizers, called the island \"Iouana\", which means \"where the iguana is found\".\n\n# History\n\n## Pre-colonial period\n\nThe first inhabitants of Saint Lucia were the Carib people, who migrated to the island from the mainland of South America around 1000 AD. The Caribs were skilled farmers and fishermen, and they developed a complex society with a system of chiefs and villages. They also had trade relations with other islands in the Caribbean and with the native peoples of the mainland.\n\n## Early European period\n\nIn 1502, Christopher Columbus became the first European to sight the island. He named it \"Santa Lucia\" and claimed it for Spain. However, the Spanish did not colonize the island, and it remained uninhabited for the next several decades. In 1660, the French established a settlement on the island, and they began to cultivate sugar, coffee, and other crops. The French also introduced African slaves to the island, who were used to work on the plantations.\n\n## 18th and 19th centuries\n\nIn 1717, the French ceded Saint Lucia to the British, who renamed it \"Saint Lucia\". The British established a series of plantations on the island, and they brought in more African slaves to work on them. The British also introduced new crops, such as cotton and indigo, and they developed a thriving export economy. However, the slave trade was abolished in 1834, and many of the plantations were abandoned.\n\n## 20th century\n\nIn the early 20th century, Saint Lucia began to move towards independence. The island gained internal self-government in 1958, and in 1967, it became a fully independent nation.

The island is subject to hurricanes and tropical storms, particularly during the summer months.

The highest peak, Mount Gimie, reaches a height of 950 meters. The island is also home to several hot springs and geysers, which are a result of the volcanic activity.\n\n# Government\n\n## Administrative divisions\n\nSaint Lucia is divided into 11 administrative districts, each with its own local government. The districts are: Anse-la-Raye, Castries, Choiseul, Dennery, Gros-Islet, Laborie, Micoud, Praslin, Soufrière, Vieux-Fort, and Villages.\n\n## Law and crime\n\nSaint Lucia has a relatively high crime rate, with a focus on petty theft and burglary. The country also has a problem with human trafficking and organized crime. The government has implemented a range of measures to address these issues, including the establishment of a police force and a prison system.\n\n## Foreign relations\n\nSaint Lucia has diplomatic relations with over 100 countries around the world. The country is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, and the Caribbean Community. Saint Lucia also has a number of bilateral agreements with other countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada.\n\n# Economy\n\n## Tourism\n\nTourism is a major sector of the Saint Lucian economy, accounting for around 30% of GDP. The country has a number of popular tourist attractions, including the Sulphur Springs, the Gros Piton, and the Rodney Bay Marina.

He is a long-time member of the Italian Communist Party and has held various positions in the Italian government and parliament.\n\nEarly life\n\nGiorgio Napolitano was born in Pola, a city in the Istrian region of what was then Italian Dalmatia, on June 29, 1925. His family was of Italian descent, and his parents were both from the southern region of Campania. Napolitano's early life was marked by the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini, which ruled Italy from 1922 to 1943. He grew up in a family that was not particularly politicized, but he was exposed to the ideology of the fascist regime through his school and community.\n\nEarly political career\n\n### World War II and anti-fascist resistance\n\nDuring World War II, Napolitano joined the Italian resistance movement against the fascist regime. He was a member of the Young Communist League and participated in various acts of sabotage and resistance against the fascist authorities. After the Allied invasion of Italy in 1943, Napolitano continued to fight against the fascist regime, which had allied itself with Nazi Germany.\n\n### From post-war years to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956\n\nAfter the war, Napolitano returned to Italy and became involved in the country's post-war reconstruction. He joined the Italian Communist Party (PCI) and quickly rose through the party's ranks. In the 1950s, Napolitano became a key figure in the PCI's youth organization, the Young Communists. He also played a role in the party's foreign policy, particularly with regard to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.\n\nLeading member of the Italian Communist Party\n\n### From the 1960s to 1980s\n\nIn the 1960s, Napolitano became a leader of the PCI, serving as the party's national secretary from 1975 to 1990. During this period, he played a key role in shaping the party's policies and ideology. He was a strong advocate for the party's participation in national politics and for the creation of a socialist economy.\n\nNapolitano was also a key figure in the PCI's relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. He was a strong supporter of the Soviet Union and its policies, but he also advocated for greater autonomy and reform within the Eastern European communist bloc.\n\nAfter the Italian Communist Party\n\n### President of the Chamber of Deputies\n\nIn 1992, Napolitano was elected as the President of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the Italian parliament. He served in this position until 1996, when he was elected as the President of the Italian Senate.\n\n### Late 1990s and early 2000s\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Napolitano continued to play a key role in Italian politics. He was a key figure in the negotiations that led to the creation of the center-left coalition government led by Prime Minister Romano Prodi. He also played a role in the party's foreign policy, particularly with regard to the Balkans and the Middle East.\n\nPresident of Italy\n\n### First term (2006-2013)\n\nIn 2006, Napolitano was elected as the 11th President of Italy, serving a seven-year term. He was the first Italian president to have previously served as the head of the Communist Party.\n\n#### Election\n\nNapolitano was elected as President by the Italian parliament with a large majority, receiving 543 votes out of 945. He was supported by the center-left coalition government led by Prime Minister Romano Prodi.\n\n#### Prodi Cabinet\n\nDuring his presidency, Napolitano worked closely with the Prodi cabinet, which was formed in 2006. He played a key role in shaping the cabinet's policies and was a strong supporter of its efforts to reform the Italian economy and reduce unemployment.\n\n#### 2008 political crisis\n\nIn 2008, Italy was hit by a severe financial crisis, which led to a political crisis in the country. Napolitano played a key role in mediating the crisis, working closely with the government and the opposition to find a solution.\n\n#### Eluana Englaro incident\n\nIn 2009, Napolitano became involved in a controversy surrounding the case of Eluana Englaro, a woman who had been in a coma for 17 years. Her family had sought to remove her from life support, but the Italian government had intervened to prevent this. Napolitano played a key role in mediating the crisis, ultimately allowing Englaro to be removed from life support.\n\n#### 2011 political crisis\n\nIn 2011, Italy was hit by another financial crisis, which led to a political crisis in the country. Napolitano played a key role in mediating the crisis, working closely with the government and the opposition to find a solution.\n\n### Second term (2013-2015)\n\nIn 2013, Napolitano was re-elected as President of Italy, serving a second seven-year term. He was the first Italian president to be re-elected since the end of World War II.\n\n#### Re-election\n\nNapolitano was re-elected as President by the Italian parliament with a large majority, receiving 665 votes out of 943. He was supported by the center-left coalition government led by Prime Minister Enrico Letta.\n\n#### Letta Cabinet\n\nDuring his second term, Napolitano worked closely with the Letta cabinet, which was formed in 2013. He played a key role in shaping the cabinet's policies and was a strong supporter of its efforts to reform the Italian economy and reduce unemployment.\n\n#### Renzi Cabinet\n\nIn 2014, Napolitano worked closely with the Renzi cabinet, which was formed after the resignation of Prime Minister Enrico Letta. He played a key role in shaping the cabinet's policies and was a strong supporter of its efforts to reform the Italian economy and reduce unemployment.\n\nResignation\n\nIn 2015, Napolitano resigned as President of Italy, citing his desire to retire from politics. He was succeeded by Sergio Mattarella, who was elected as the 12th President of Italy.\n\nLater life\n\nSince his resignation as President of Italy, Napolitano has remained active in politics, serving as a member of the Italian Senate. He has also written several books on Italian politics and history.\n\nPersonal life\n\n### Relations with the Catholic Church\n\nNapolitano has had a complex relationship with the Catholic Church throughout his career. In the 1960s and 1970s, he was a strong supporter of the Church's social teachings, but he also criticized the Church's conservative stance on issues such as birth control and abortion. In the 1980s and 1990s, he became increasingly critical of the Church's politics, particularly its opposition to the Italian Communist Party.\n\n### Death and state funeral\n\nNapolitano died on February 23, 2023, at the age of 97.

The Polish judicial system is based on the principles of independence, impartiality, and separation of powers.\n\n**Structure**\n\nThe Polish judiciary is composed of several types of courts and tribunals, each with its own jurisdiction and powers.\n\n### Common courts\n\nCommon courts in Poland are the courts of first instance, with jurisdiction over civil, criminal, and administrative cases. These courts are divided into three levels: district courts (Sądy Rejonowe), regional courts (Sądy Okręgowe), and the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy).\n\n**District courts**\n\nDistrict courts are the lowest level of common courts, with jurisdiction over cases in a specific geographic area. There are 164 district courts in Poland, each serving a population of approximately 100,000 to 200,000 people. District courts have jurisdiction over civil cases with a value of up to 50,000 PLN (approximately 12,000 EUR), as well as minor criminal cases.\n\n**Regional courts**\n\nRegional courts are the next level of common courts, with jurisdiction over appeals from district courts. There are 42 regional courts in Poland, each serving a population of approximately 1 million to 2 million people. Regional courts have jurisdiction over civil cases with a value of up to 100,000 PLN (approximately 24,000 EUR), as well as more serious criminal cases.\n\n**Supreme Court**\n\nThe Supreme Court is the highest level of common courts, with jurisdiction over appeals from regional courts. The Supreme Court is composed of 120 judges, who are divided into 27 chambers. The Supreme Court has jurisdiction over all types of cases, including civil, criminal, and administrative cases.\n\n### Military courts\n\nMilitary courts in Poland have jurisdiction over cases involving military personnel and civilians who have committed crimes related to national security or military service. There are three military courts in Poland: the Military Court of Appeal, the Military Court of First Instance, and the Military Prosecutor's Office.\n\n### Administrative courts\n\nAdministrative courts in Poland have jurisdiction over cases involving administrative decisions made by government agencies and public institutions. There are 43 administrative courts in Poland, each serving a population of approximately 1 million to 2 million people. Administrative courts have jurisdiction over cases involving administrative decisions related to taxes, social security, and public services.\n\n### Constitutional Tribunal\n\nThe Constitutional Tribunal is the highest court in Poland, with jurisdiction over constitutional cases. The Constitutional Tribunal has nine judges, who are appointed by the President of Poland. The Constitutional Tribunal has jurisdiction over cases involving the interpretation of the Constitution, as well as cases involving the constitutionality of laws and government actions.\n\n### State Tribunal\n\nThe State Tribunal is a specialized court that has jurisdiction over cases involving high-ranking government officials and politicians. The State Tribunal has jurisdiction over cases involving corruption, embezzlement, and other serious crimes committed by government officials.\n\n**Procedure**\n\nThe procedure for bringing a case to court in Poland varies depending on the type of case and the level of court. In general, the procedure involves the following steps:\n\n1. Filing a complaint: The plaintiff files a complaint with the court, which must include a statement of the facts of the case and the relief sought.\n2. Investigation: The court investigates the complaint and gathers evidence.\n3. Hearing: The court holds a hearing, during which the parties present their arguments and evidence.\n4. Decision: The court renders a decision, which is binding on the parties.\n\n**Staff**\n\nThe Polish judiciary is staffed by judges and court assessors, who are appointed by the President of Poland.\n\n### Judges and court assessors\n\nJudges and court assessors are appointed by the President of Poland, who is assisted by the National Council of the Judiciary.\n\n#### National Council of the Judiciary\n\nThe National Council of the Judiciary is a body that oversees the appointment and evaluation of judges and court assessors. The National Council of the Judiciary is composed of 25 members, who are appointed by the President of Poland.\n\n#### Procedure of appointment\n\nThe procedure for appointing judges and court assessors involves the following steps:\n\n1. Nomination: The President of Poland nominates candidates for the position of judge or court assessor.\n2. Evaluation: The National Council of the Judiciary evaluates the candidates and recommends them for appointment.\n3. Appointment: The President of Poland appoints the candidates as judges or court assessors.\n\n#### Rights and duties\n\nJudges and court assessors have the following rights and duties:\n\n* The right to hear cases and render decisions\n* The duty to remain impartial and independent\n* The duty to uphold the law and the Constitution\n* The duty to respect the rights of the parties\n\n### Judges sitting in the tribunals\n\nJudges sitting in the tribunals are responsible for hearing cases and rendering decisions. They must remain impartial and independent, and must uphold the law and the Constitution.\n\n### Other judicial positions\n\nThere are several other judicial positions in Poland, including:\n\n* The President of the Supreme Court\n* The President of the Constitutional Tribunal\n* The President of the State Tribunal\n* Court clerks and other administrative staff\n\n### Remuneration\n\nJudges and court assessors are remunerated for their work, with salaries and benefits determined by the government.\n\n**Minimal requirements**\n\nTo become a judge or court assessor in Poland, one must meet the following minimal requirements:\n\n* Be a citizen of Poland\n* Have a higher education degree in law\n* Have at least 5 years of experience in the legal profession\n* Pass a written examination administered by the National Council of the Judiciary\n\n**Issues**\n\nThe Polish judiciary has faced several issues in recent years, including:\n\n### Length of proceedings\n\nOne of the issues facing the Polish judiciary is the length of proceedings. Cases can take years to resolve, which can cause frustration and anxiety for the parties involved.\n\n### Lack of popular support and trust\n\nAnother issue facing the Polish judiciary is the lack of popular support and trust. Many Poles have lost confidence in the judiciary, which can be due to a variety of factors, including perceived corruption and bias.\n\n### Other issues\n\nOther issues facing the Polish judiciary include:\n\n* Underfunding and lack of resources\n* Insufficient training and development for judges and court assessors\n* Lack of transparency and accountability\n\n### Rule of law concerns\n\nThe Polish judiciary has also faced concerns related to the rule of law, including:\n\n* **Capture of the Constitutional Tribunal**: In 2015, the Polish government passed a law that gave it control over the Constitutional Tribunal, which led to concerns about the independence of the judiciary.\n* **Undue influence on judges**: There have been allegations of undue influence on judges, particularly in cases involving high-ranking government officials and politicians.\n* **Partisan control of the National Council of the Judiciary**: The National Council of the Judiciary has been criticized for its partisan composition, which can lead to biased decisions.\n\n### Repercussions in Poland and abroad\n\nThe issues facing the Polish judiciary have had repercussions both in Poland and abroad, including:\n\n* Loss of public trust and confidence in the judiciary\n* International criticism and sanctions\n* Economic and social consequences, including reduced foreign investment and tourism\n\n**See also**\n\n* Judiciary of Poland (in Polish)\n* National Council of the Judiciary (in Polish)\n* Constitutional Tribunal of Poland (in Polish)\n* State Tribunal of Poland (in Polish)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and is intended for informational purposes only.\n* The information contained in this article may not be comprehensive or up-to-date, and should not be relied upon as the sole source of information on the subject.\n\n**References**\n\n* (none)\n\n**External links**\n\n* National Council of the Judiciary (in Polish)\n* Constitutional Tribunal of Poland (in Polish)\n* State Tribunal of Poland (in Polish)\n* Ministry of Justice of Poland (in Polish)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Judiciary_of_Poland\" following this outline:\n\n#Structure\n##Common courts\n##Military courts\n##Supreme Court\n##Administrative courts\n##Constitutional Tribunal\n##State Tribunal\n#Procedure\n#Staff\n##Judges and court assessors\n###National Council of the Judiciary\n####Procedure of appointment\n####Rights and duties\n##Judges sitting in the tribunals\n##Other judicial positions\n##Remuneration\n#Minimal requirements\n#Issues\n##Length of proceedings\n##Lack of popular support and trust\n##Other issues\n##Rule of law concerns\n###Capture of the Constitutional Tribunal\n###Undue influence on judges\n###Partisan control of the National Council of the Judiciary\n####Arbitrary secondment of judges\n###Repercussions in Poland and abroad\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

These balloons have been used for military surveillance and espionage purposes, allowing countries to gather intelligence on enemy territories and military movements. China has been known to use reconnaissance balloons in the past, particularly during the Cold War era.\n\n#### Past Chinese Balloons and Unidentified Objects\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the United States detected and shot down several Chinese reconnaissance balloons that had entered American airspace. In the 2000s, the United States and China had several incidents involving unidentified objects entering the airspace of both countries. In 2006, the United States shot down a Chinese unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that had entered American airspace.\n\n### U.S.–China Tensions\n\nThe U.S.–China relationship has been strained for several years, with tensions rising over issues such as trade, security, and human rights. The Chinese balloon incident has further strained relations between the two countries, with the United States viewing the balloon as a serious breach of national security.\n\n**Incident**\n\nThe 2023 Chinese balloon incident began on January 28, 2023, when a high-altitude balloon was detected entering the airspace of Alaska, United States. Over the next several days, the balloon traveled across the United States, entering the airspace of several states, including Montana, Idaho, and Nebraska.\n\n### Balloon\n\nThe balloon was estimated to be approximately 200 feet (61 meters) tall and 60 feet (18 meters) wide. It was propelled by a buoyant gas, which allowed it to stay aloft for extended periods of time. The balloon was equipped with a payload, which included a surveillance system capable of collecting signals intelligence.\n\n### Signals Intelligence Capabilities\n\nThe balloon's payload was equipped with a signals intelligence system, which allowed it to collect communications and electronic signals from various sources. This system was capable of intercepting and decoding a wide range of signals, including those used by military and civilian communications systems.\n\n### Detection\n\nThe balloon was initially detected by radar systems in Alaska, which alerted authorities to its presence. As the balloon traveled across the United States, it was tracked by a variety of sensors and surveillance systems, including those operated by the U.S. military and civilian agencies.\n\n### Flight Path\n\nThe balloon's flight path took it across several states, including Montana, Idaho, and Nebraska. It also entered the airspace of several major cities, including Chicago and Washington, D.C.\n\n### U.S. Monitoring and Counterintelligence\n\nAs the balloon traveled across the United States, U.S. authorities monitored its activities closely, using a variety of sensors and surveillance systems to track its movements and intercept its communications. The U.S. military also scrambled fighter jets to intercept the balloon, but it was not shot down until it had entered Canadian airspace.\n\n### Downing\n\nOn February 4, 2023, the United States shot down the balloon over the Atlantic Ocean, using an F-22 Raptor fighter jet. The balloon was destroyed, and its debris was recovered by the U.S. military.\n\n### Debris Recovery\n\nThe U.S. military recovered several pieces of the balloon's debris, including a large piece of the balloon's skin and a piece of its payload. The debris was examined by U.S. authorities, who confirmed that it was of Chinese origin.\n\n**Legality of Airspace and Downing**\n\nThe Chinese balloon incident raises several questions about the legality of airspace and the downing of the balloon. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) governs the use of airspace, including the rights of states to shoot down foreign objects that enter their airspace. However, the specifics of the convention are complex, and the downing of the balloon may be subject to interpretation.\n\n**Response and Reactions**\n\nThe Chinese balloon incident has sparked a wide range of reactions from governments and international organizations around the world.\n\n### United States\n\nThe United States has condemned the Chinese balloon incident, viewing it as a serious breach of national security. The U.S. government has also called on China to explain the purpose of the balloon and to take steps to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\n### Canada\n\nCanada has also condemned the Chinese balloon incident, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau calling it a \"serious incident.\" The Canadian government has demanded an explanation from China and has pledged to work closely with the United States to address the incident.\n\n### China\n\nChina has responded to the incident by denying any wrongdoing and claiming that the balloon was a weather balloon that had strayed off course. Chinese officials have also accused the United States of overreacting and of trying to stigmatize China.\n\n### NATO\n\nNATO has issued a statement condemning the Chinese balloon incident and calling on China to explain its actions. The alliance has also emphasized the importance of maintaining open lines of communication and cooperation between nations.\n\n### Australia\n\nAustralia has also condemned the Chinese balloon incident, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese calling it a \"serious breach of international norms.\" The Australian government has pledged to work closely with the United States and other allies to address the incident.\n\n### Japan\n\nJapan has also condemned the Chinese balloon incident, with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida calling it a \"serious incident.\" The Japanese government has demanded an explanation from China and has pledged to work closely with the United States and other allies to address the incident.\n\n### Singapore\n\nSingapore has also condemned the Chinese balloon incident, with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong calling it a \"serious incident.\" The Singaporean government has demanded an explanation from China and has pledged to work closely with the United States and other allies to address the incident.\n\n### United Kingdom\n\nThe United Kingdom has also condemned the Chinese balloon incident, with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling it a \"serious breach of international norms.\" The British government has demanded an explanation from China and has pledged to work closely with the United States and other allies to address the incident.\n\n### Venezuela\n\nVenezuela has also condemned the Chinese balloon incident, with President Nicolás Maduro calling it a \"serious incident.\" The Venezuelan government has demanded an explanation from China and has pledged to work closely with the United States and other allies to address the incident.\n\n### Media Reactions\n\nThe Chinese balloon incident has sparked a wide range of reactions from the media, with many outlets condemning the incident and calling for greater accountability from China.\n\n#### Analysis\n\nMany analysts have viewed the Chinese balloon incident as a serious breach of national security and a challenge to the international order. They have argued that the incident highlights the need for greater cooperation and communication between nations, as well as greater transparency and accountability from China.\n\n#### Satire\n\nSome outlets have responded to the incident with satire, with many humorously accusing China of using the balloon to spy on American fast food joints. Others have poked fun at the U.S. government's response, with many joking that the downing of the balloon was a serious overreaction.\n\n**Other high-altitude objects in February 2023**\n\nIn addition to the Chinese balloon incident, several other high-altitude objects were detected in February 2023, including a U.S. Air Force balloon that was launched to test a new propulsion system.\n\n**Additional assessments of the balloon**\n\nThe U.S. government has conducted several assessments of the Chinese balloon, including an examination of its payload and a review of its flight path. These assessments have concluded that the balloon was equipped with a sophisticated surveillance system and was used for military purposes.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of Chinese surveillance balloons\n* U.S.–China relations\n* International relations\n* Military espionage\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The exact details of the Chinese balloon incident are still emerging, and this article will be updated as more information becomes available.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Chinese_balloon_incident\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##History and development of reconnaissance balloons\n###Past Chinese balloons and unidentified objects\n##U.S.–China tensions\n#Incident\n##Balloon\n###Size, propulsion, and payload\n###Signals intelligence capabilities\n##Detection\n##Flight path\n##U.S. monitoring and counterintelligence\n##Downing\n##Debris recovery\n#Legality of airspace and downing\n#Response and reactions\n##United States\n##Canada\n##China\n##NATO\n##Australia\n##Japan\n##Singapore\n##United Kingdom\n##Venezuela\n##Media reactions\n###Analysis\n###Satire\n#Other high-altitude objects in February 2023\n#Additional assessments of the balloon\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They have been a member of FIFA since 1960 and have participated in several international competitions, including the FIFA World Cup and the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\n**History**\n\n### Pre-independence period\n\nThe Morocco national football team was first established in 1908, when Morocco was still a French protectorate. The team played their first international match in 1920 against France, which they lost 7-1. During this period, the team was made up of French and Moroccan players.\n\n### Beginning of Morocco (1955–1963)\n\nAfter Morocco gained its independence in 1956, the national football team began to take shape. The team's first coach was Frenchman Jean Snella, who led the team to several victories against African and Arab countries. In 1957, Morocco joined the African Football Federation and began to participate in international competitions.\n\n### First appearances in international competitions (1963–1976)\n\nMorocco made their debut in the Africa Cup of Nations in 1963, where they finished fourth. They also participated in the 1964 Summer Olympics, where they lost to Hungary in the first round. During this period, the team was coached by Frenchmen Jean Snella and Omar Béhar.\n\n### Between successes and defeats (1976–1986)\n\nIn the 1970s, Morocco experienced a period of success, finishing third in the 1976 Africa Cup of Nations and reaching the quarterfinals of the 1976 Olympic Games. However, the team also suffered several defeats, including a 9-0 loss to Argentina in a friendly match in 1981.\n\n### Golden generation (1986–2000)\n\nThe 1980s saw the emergence of Morocco's golden generation, which included players such as Abdellah Benachir, Ahmed Faras, and Mustapha Khalloufi. Under the coaching of Frenchman Henri Michel, the team reached the quarterfinals of the 1986 World Cup and finished third in the 1988 Africa Cup of Nations.\n\n### Difficult years (2006–2017)\n\nIn the 2000s, Morocco experienced a decline in their fortunes, failing to qualify for several major international competitions. The team was also plagued by poor management and a lack of investment in youth development. During this period, the team was coached by several managers, including Frenchman Henri Michel and Moroccan coach Roger Lemerre.\n\n### Second golden generation (2017–present)\n\nIn 2017, Morocco appointed Walid Regragui as their new coach, marking the beginning of a new era for the team. The team has since shown significant improvement, reaching the quarterfinals of the 2018 Africa Cup of Nations and finishing third in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.\n\n**Home stadium**\n\nThe Morocco national football team plays their home matches at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat, which has a capacity of 52,000. The stadium was opened in 1983 and has undergone several renovations over the years.\n\n**Kit suppliers**\n\nThe Morocco national football team's kits are supplied by Adidas, who have been their official kit supplier since 2013.\n\n**Results and fixtures**\n\n### 2023\n\n* Friendlies:\n\t+ Morocco 2-1 Burkina Faso (March 24, 2023)\n\t+ Morocco 2-1 Guinea (March 28, 2023)\n* Africa Cup of Nations:\n\t+ Group stage: Morocco 2-0 Malawi (June 12, 2023)\n\t+ Group stage: Morocco 2-1 Senegal (June 16, 2023)\n\n### 2024\n\n* Friendlies:\n\t+ Morocco vs. Brazil (March 26, 2024)\n\t+ Morocco vs. Argentina (March 30, 2024)\n* Africa Cup of Nations:\n\t+ Group stage: Morocco vs. Egypt (June 2, 2024)\n\t+ Group stage: Morocco vs. Mozambique (June 6, 2024)\n\n**Coaching staff**\n\n### Coaching history\n\n* Abdulhadi Benslimane (1955-1956)\n* Jean Snella (1957-1960)\n* Omar Béhar (1961-1964)\n* François Worms (1965-1966)\n* Rachid Abdellatif (1967-1968)\n* Rachid Abdellatif (1969-1970)\n* Henri Michel (1971-1972)\n* Rachid Abdellatif (1973-1974)\n* Henri Michel (1975-1976)\n* Rachid Abdellatif (1977-1978)\n* Henri Michel (1979-1980)\n* Rachid Abdellatif (1981)\n* Henri Michel (1982-1983)\n* Rachid Abdellatif (1984-1985)\n* Henri Michel (1986-1987)\n* Rachid Abdellatif (1988-1989)\n* Henri Michel (1990-1991)\n* Rachid Abdellatif (1992-1993)\n* Henri Michel (1994-1995)\n* Rachid Abdellatif (1996-1997)\n* Henri Michel (1998-1999)\n* Rachid Abdellatif (2000-2001)\n* Henri Michel (2002-2003)\n* Rachid Abdellatif (2004-2005)\n* Henri Michel (2006-2007)\n* Rachid Abdellatif (2008-2009)\n* Henri Michel (2010-2011)\n* Rachid Abdellatif (2012-2013)\n* Walid Regragui (2014-2015)\n* Rachid Abdellatif (2016-2017)\n* Walid Regragui (2018-2019)\n* Rachid Abdellatif (2020-2021)\n* Walid Regragui (2022-present)\n\n**Players**\n\n### Current squad\n\n* Goalkeepers:\n\t+ Yassine Bounou (Sevilla)\n\t+ Munir Mohamedi (Al-Wehda)\n\t+ Ahmed Reda Tagnaouti (Dijon)\n* Defenders:\n\t+ Romain Saïss (Besiktas)\n\t+ Achraf Hakimi (Paris Saint-Germain)\n\t+ Rami Ghezal (GFC Ajaccio)\n\t+ Karim Achahbar (Hajer)\n\t+ Sofyan Amrabat (Fiorentina)\n* Midfielders:\n\t+ Hakim Ziyech (Chelsea)\n\t+ Mehdi Carcela (Al-Hilal)\n\t+ Amine Harit (Sevilla)\n\t+ Sofyan Amrabat (Fiorentina)\n\t+ Karim El Ahmadi (Umm Salal)\n* Forwards:\n\t+ Sofiane Boufal (Angers)\n\t+ Youssef En-Nesyri (Sevilla)\n\t+ Ayoub El Kaabi (Hatayspor)\n\t+ Anass Zaroury (Burnley)\n\n### Recent call-ups\n\n* Sofyan Amrabat (Fiorentina) -

The majority of these wells are located in rural areas, where the original operators have gone bankrupt or ceased operations. The province has been working to address the issue, with a focus on reclamation and abandonment procedures.\n\n**Context**\n\nThe oil and gas industry has been a significant contributor to Alberta's economy for decades, with thousands of wells drilled and producing oil and natural gas. However, the industry has faced significant challenges in recent years, including declining oil prices, increased competition, and environmental concerns. As a result, many operators have gone bankrupt, leaving behind a trail of abandoned wells.\n\n**Landowners and Municipalities**\n\nLandowners and municipalities are often affected by orphan wells, as they may be responsible for maintenance and cleanup costs. In some cases, landowners may be required to pay for the abandonment of wells on their property, even if they were not the original operators. Municipalities may also be responsible for providing services and infrastructure to support oil and gas operations.\n\n**Orphan Well Association**\n\nThe Orphan Well Association (OWA) is a non-profit organization that works to reclaim and abandon orphan wells in Alberta. The OWA was established in 2017 and is funded by the Alberta government. The organization's main goal is to ensure that orphan wells are properly reclaimed and abandoned, reducing the risk of environmental harm and economic liability.\n\n**OWA Funding**\n\nThe OWA receives funding from the Alberta government, which is allocated through the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER). The AER is responsible for overseeing the oil and gas industry in Alberta and ensuring that operators comply with regulations. The OWA also receives funding from federal government subsidies, which are discussed below.\n\n##Federal and Provincial Subsidies\n\nThe federal and provincial governments provide subsidies to the OWA to support the reclamation and abandonment of orphan wells. The Canadian government has committed to providing funding to support the cleanup of orphan wells, with a focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting economic growth.\n\n##Alberta Energy Regulator\n\nThe Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) is responsible for overseeing the oil and gas industry in Alberta, including the reclamation and abandonment of orphan wells. The AER sets regulations and guidelines for operators to follow, and enforces compliance through inspections and fines.\n\n**Legal and Regulatory Considerations**\n\nThe polluter pays principle is a key concept in environmental law, which holds that the party responsible for pollution should be responsible for its cleanup and mitigation. In the case of orphan wells, the polluter pays principle suggests that the original operator should be responsible for the costs of reclamation and abandonment.\n\n##Polluter Pays Principle\n\nThe polluter pays principle is an important consideration in the context of orphan wells, as it ensures that the party responsible for the pollution is held accountable for its cleanup and mitigation. This principle is reflected in the regulations and guidelines set by the AER.\n\n##Suspended Inactive Wells\n\nSuspended inactive wells are wells that are no longer producing oil or gas, but are still maintained by operators. These wells are often at risk of becoming orphaned, as operators may go bankrupt or cease operations. The AER requires operators to provide bonds or other forms of security to ensure that suspended inactive wells are properly reclaimed and abandoned.\n\n**Bankruptcies and Orphan Wells**\n\nBankruptcies and orphan wells are closely linked, as many operators have gone bankrupt due to declining oil prices, increased competition, and environmental concerns. When an operator goes bankrupt, the AER takes over responsibility for the abandonment of wells, which can lead to costly cleanup and reclamation procedures.\n\n##Strategic Packaging of Costly Liabilities with Productive Assets\n\nStrategic packaging of costly liabilities with productive assets refers to the practice of bundling abandoned wells with productive wells to reduce costs and liabilities. This practice can be beneficial for operators, but it can also lead to environmental and economic risks.\n\n**Environmental Impacts of Orphan Wells**\n\nOrphan wells can have significant environmental impacts, including fugitive gas emissions, surface casing vent flow (SCVF), and gas migration (GM).\n\n##Fugitive Gas Emissions\n\nFugitive gas emissions refer to the release of greenhouse gases, such as methane and carbon dioxide, from abandoned wells. These emissions can contribute to climate change and have significant environmental and economic impacts.\n\n##Surface Casing Vent Flow (SCVF) and Gas Migration (GM)\n\nSurface casing vent flow (SCVF) and gas migration (GM) refer to the release of fluids and gases from abandoned wells, which can contaminate soil and groundwater. These issues can be costly to mitigate and require specialized cleanup procedures.\n\n**Potential Geothermal Conversion of Orphan Wells in Alberta**\n\nGeothermal conversion of orphan wells in Alberta is a promising technology that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote economic growth. By converting abandoned wells into geothermal power plants, operators can generate clean energy and reduce their environmental footprint.\n\n**Responses**\n\nThe Alberta government and industry stakeholders are working to address the issue of orphan wells, with a focus on reclamation and abandonment procedures. The OWA is playing a key role in this effort, working to reclaim and abandon orphan wells and promote environmental sustainability.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Oil and gas industry in Alberta\n* Environmental impacts of oil and gas production\n* Climate change mitigation strategies\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and may not reflect the views of individual companies or organizations.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Orphan Well Association (OWA)\n* Alberta Energy Regulator (AER)\n* Government of Alberta: Orphan Wells\n* Canadian Energy Research Institute: Orphan Wells", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Orphan_wells_in_Alberta,_Canada\" following this outline:\n\n#Current overview\n#Context\n#Landowners and municipalities\n#Orphan Well Association\n#OWA funding\n##Federal and provincial subsidies\n#Alberta Energy Regulator\n#Legal and regulatory considerations\n##Polluter pays principle\n##Suspended inactive wells\n#Bankruptcies and orphan wells\n##Strategic packaging of costly liabilities with productive assets\n#Environmental impacts of orphan wells\n##Fugitive gas emissions\n##Surface casing vent flow (SCVF) and gas migration (GM)\n#Potential geothermal conversion of orphan wells in Alberta\n#Responses\n#See also\n#Notes\n#External links\n#Citations\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
