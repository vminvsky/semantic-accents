He was a member of the powerful House of Retz and played a significant role in the Hundred Years' War between France and England. However, his life took a dark turn, marked by allegations of occult involvement, child murders, and ultimately, a tragic end.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nGilles de Rais was born in 1404 in Champtocé, a small village in the province of Anjou, France. He was the youngest son of Guy de Rais, a nobleman and military leader, and Catherine de Thouars, a member of the powerful House of Thouars. Gilles' early life was marked by a complex web of family disputes, matrimonial projects, and a desire for wealth and power.\n\n**House of Retz**\n\n### Early life\n\nGilles de Rais was raised in a world of luxury and privilege, surrounded by the trappings of nobility. His family, the House of Retz, was one of the most powerful in France, with extensive lands and titles. However, Gilles' early life was also marked by turmoil and conflict. His family was embroiled in a bitter dispute over the succession to the throne of Brittany, which would eventually lead to a series of civil wars.\n\n### Matrimonial projects\n\nAs a young man, Gilles de Rais was betrothed to Marie of Anjou, a member of the powerful House of Valois-Anjou. The marriage was part of a larger alliance between the two families, designed to secure their power and influence in the region. However, the marriage was ultimately canceled, and Gilles de Rais was left without a clear path to wealth and power.\n\n### Family disputes\n\nGilles de Rais' family was marked by a series of bitter disputes over land, wealth, and power. His father, Guy de Rais, was a rival of the powerful Jean de Montfort, who would eventually become the Duke of Brittany. These disputes would have a lasting impact on Gilles' life, shaping his military career and ultimately, his downfall.\n\n### Titles, estates, and wealth\n\nDespite the challenges he faced, Gilles de Rais was a wealthy and influential nobleman. He inherited a significant amount of land and titles from his family, including the lordship of Champtocé and the castle of Machecoul. He also received a significant dowry from his cancelled marriage to Marie of Anjou, which further increased his wealth and influence.\n\n**Military career**\n\n### First hypothetical feat of arms\n\nGilles de Rais' military career began at a young age, serving under his father, Guy de Rais, in a series of battles against the English. His first recorded feat of arms was in 1425, when he led a group of soldiers in a successful raid against an English garrison in the province of Maine.\n\n### Franco-Breton alliance through the House of Valois-Anjou\n\nGilles de Rais played a key role in the Franco-Breton alliance, serving as a military leader and diplomat for the House of Valois-Anjou. He was a key advisor to the Duke of Brittany, Jean de Montfort, and helped to negotiate a series of alliances between the two families.\n\n### Guerilla warfare against English garrisons on the borders of Maine\n\nGilles de Rais was a skilled guerrilla warrior, using his knowledge of the land and his military tactics to launch a series of successful raids against English garrisons on the borders of Maine.\n\n### Companion in arms with Joan of Arc\n\nGilles de Rais was a close companion and advisor to Joan of Arc, serving as her military leader and mentor. He played a key role in her campaign to drive the English out of France and was present at several of her most famous battles.\n\n### Civil wars between La Trémoille and Richemont's allies\n\nGilles de Rais was embroiled in a series of civil wars between the allies of La Trémoille and Richemont. He fought on the side of La Trémoille, using his military skills and knowledge of the land to launch a series of successful attacks against Richemont's forces.\n\n### Lifting of the siege of Lagny\n\nGilles de Rais played a key role in the lifting of the siege of Lagny, a town on the borders of Maine. He led a group of soldiers in a successful attack against the English garrison, lifting the siege and securing the town for the French.\n\n### Reduction of military commitments\n\nAs the Hundred Years' War drew to a close, Gilles de Rais began to reduce his military commitments. He returned to his castle at Machecoul, where he lived a quiet life, surrounded by his family and his wealth.\n\n**Squandering of heritage**\n\nHowever, Gilles de Rais' life took a dark turn, marked by a series of reckless and extravagant spending. He squandered his inheritance, spending vast sums on luxury goods, including fine clothes, jewelry, and art.\n\n**Criminal life**\n\n### Occult involvement\n\nGilles de Rais became increasingly involved in occult practices, believed to have included witchcraft and demonic rituals. His involvement in these practices would have a lasting impact on his life, shaping his actions and ultimately, his downfall.\n\n### Child murders\n\nGilles de Rais was accused of murdering several young children, believed to have been used in his occult rituals. The allegations were shocking, and Gilles de Rais was eventually arrested and put on trial.\n\n### Act of force in Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte\n\nGilles de Rais was also accused of committing an act of force in Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte, a small village in the province of Anjou. The details of the incident are unclear, but it is believed to have involved the murder of several young children.\n\n### Ecclesiastical and secular investigations\n\nThe allegations against Gilles de Rais sparked a series of ecclesiastical and secular investigations. The Catholic Church launched an inquiry into the allegations, while the French authorities began to gather evidence against him.\n\n### Trial and execution\n\nGilles de Rais was eventually put on trial, accused of murder, heresy, and witchcraft. The trial was a sham, with the outcome predetermined. Gilles de Rais was found guilty and sentenced to death. He was hanged and burned at the stake in Nantes in 1440.\n\n**Question of guilt**\n\nThe question of Gilles de Rais' guilt remains a subject of debate. Some historians argue that he was a serial killer, responsible for the murder of dozens of young children. Others argue that the allegations against him were trumped up, part of a larger conspiracy to destroy his reputation.\n\n### Doubts about the verdict in the Age of Enlightenment tradition\n\nIn the Age of Enlightenment, historians began to question the verdict against Gilles de Rais. They argued that the trial was a sham, with the outcome predetermined. They also pointed out the lack of evidence against him, highlighting the inconsistencies and contradictions in the testimony of his accusers.\n\n### Occultist interpretations\n\nSome occultists have interpreted Gilles de Rais' involvement in occult practices as evidence of his guilt. They argue that his involvement in witchcraft and demonic rituals was a form of satanic worship, which led him to commit the atrocities for which he was accused.\n\n### Georges Bataille's interpretations\n\nThe French philosopher Georges Bataille wrote extensively on Gilles de Rais, arguing that his involvement in occult practices was a form of transgressive behavior, which allowed him to break free from the constraints of society.\n\n### 1992 mock re-trial\n\nIn 1992, a group of lawyers and historians organized a mock re-trial of Gilles de Rais, in an effort to clear his name and establish his guilt. The re-trial was a re-enactment of the original trial, with the same charges and the same evidence.\n\n### Contemporary academic views\n\nToday, academic views on Gilles de Rais are divided. Some historians continue to argue that he was a serial killer, responsible for the murder of dozens of young children. Others argue that the allegations against him were trumped up, part of a larger conspiracy to destroy his reputation.\n\n**Fictional portraits**\n\nGilles de Rais has been the subject of several fictional portraits, including novels, plays, and films. These works have often taken creative liberties with his life, exaggerating or distorting the facts to suit the needs of the story.\n\n### Fin de siècle portrayals\n\nIn the late 19th century, Gilles de Rais was often portrayed as a Byronic hero, a charismatic and troubled figure, driven by his passions and his demons. These portrayals were influenced by the Romantic movement, which emphasized the power of the human imagination and the importance of individual expression.\n\n### Classification as a serial killer\n\nToday, Gilles de Rais is often classified as a serial killer, responsible for the murder of dozens of young children. However, this classification is not universally accepted, and some historians argue that the allegations against him were trumped up, part of a larger conspiracy to destroy his reputation.\n\n**Gilles de Rais and the Bluebeard myth**\n\nGilles de Rais has been linked to the Bluebeard myth, a legendary figure who was said to have murdered his wives and hidden their bodies in a secret room. While the connection between Gilles de Rais and Bluebeard is not clear, it is possible that the two were influenced by a common cultural trope, the idea of the monstrous other.\n\n**Relationship with Joan of Arc**\n\nGilles de Rais was a close companion and advisor to Joan of Arc, serving as her military leader and mentor. He played a key role in her campaign to drive the English out of France and was present at several of her most famous battles.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Joan of Arc\n* Hundred Years' War\n* Occultism\n* Serial killers\n* Bluebeard myth\n\n**References**\n\n### Notes\n\n* [Note 1]\n* [Note 2]\n* [Note 3]\n\n### Footnotes\n\n* [Footnote 1]\n* [Footnote 2]\n* [Footnote 3]\n\n### Bibliography\n\n### Historical studies and literary scholarship\n\n* [Book 1]\n* [Book 2]\n* [Book 3]\n\n### Essays\n\n* [Essay 1]\n* [Essay 2]\n* [Essay 3]\n\n**External links**\n\n* [Link 1]\n* [Link 2]\n* [Link 3]", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gilles_de_Rais\" following this outline:\n\n#House of Retz\n##Early life\n##Matrimonial projects\n##Family disputes\n##Titles, estates and wealth\n#Military career\n##First hypothetical feat of arms\n##Franco-Breton alliance through the House of Valois-Anjou\n##Guerilla warfare against English garrisons on the borders of Maine\n##Companion in arms with Joan of Arc\n##Civil wars between La Trémoille and Richemont's allies\n##Lifting of the siege of Lagny\n##Reduction of military commitments\n#Squandering of heritage\n#Criminal life\n##Occult involvement\n##Child murders\n##Act of force in Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte\n##Ecclesiastical and secular investigations\n##Trial and execution\n#Question of guilt\n##Doubts about the verdict in the Age of Enlightenment tradition\n##Occultist interpretations\n##Georges Bataille's interpretations\n##1992 mock re-trial\n##Contemporary academic views\n#Fictional portraits\n#Psychopathological interpretations\n##Fin de siècle portrayals\n##Classification as a serial killer\n#Gilles de Rais and the Bluebeard myth\n#Relationship with Joan of Arc\n#See also\n#References\n##Notes\n##Footnotes\n##Bibliography\n###Historical studies and literary scholarship\n###Essays\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election was held after the 118th United States Congress convened, and it marked the first time since 1923 that the House failed to elect a Speaker on the first ballot.\n\n# Process and conventions\nThe Speaker of the United States House of Representatives is elected by the members of the House of Representatives. The Speaker is the presiding officer of the House and is responsible for setting the legislative agenda and presiding over debates. The Speaker is typically the leader of the majority party in the House, but it is not a requirement. The Speaker is elected through a series of ballots, with each member of the House casting a vote.\n\n# Democratic nomination\nThe Democratic Party nominated Hakeem Jeffries as its candidate for Speaker. Jeffries, a member of the House from New York, was the chair of the House Democratic Caucus and had been mentioned as a potential candidate for Speaker for several years.\n\n## Candidates\nJeffries was the only candidate nominated by the Democratic Party.\n\n### Nominee\nHakeem Jeffries was nominated by the Democratic Party to be its candidate for Speaker.\n\n### Declined to run\nSeveral other members of the House Democratic Caucus were mentioned as potential candidates for Speaker, but ultimately declined to run.

During this time, Italian artists such as Donatello, Michelangelo, and Bernini created works that not only reflected the cultural and social values of their time but also raised the bar for future generations of artists.\n\n# Periods\n\nThe Italian Renaissance can be broadly divided into several periods, each characterized by distinct artistic trends and styles.\n\n## To 1400\n\nPrior to 1400, Italian sculpture was heavily influenced by the International Gothic style, which emphasized elegance and refinement. Artists such as Jacopo della Quercia and Donatello began to break away from this style, introducing more naturalistic and emotive forms.\n\n## From 1400\n\nFrom 1400 onwards, Italian sculpture underwent a significant transformation, marked by the emergence of humanist ideals and the revival of classical forms. Artists such as Donatello and Michelangelo became masters of this new style, creating works that celebrated the beauty and dignity of the human form.\n\n### Doors of the Florence Baptistery\n\nThe doors of the Florence Baptistery, created by Lorenzo Ghiberti in the early 15th century, are considered one of the greatest artistic achievements of the Italian Renaissance. The doors, which depict scenes from the Bible, showcased Ghiberti's skill in combining classical forms with a sense of movement and drama.\n\n### Donatello\n\nDonatello, a pioneer of the Renaissance style, is widely regarded as one of the greatest sculptors of all time. His works, such as the bronze statue of David, showcased his mastery of technique and his ability to infuse his subjects with a sense of life and emotion.\n\n### Middle of the century\n\nDuring the middle of the 15th century, Italian sculpture continued to evolve, with artists such as Michelangelo and Verrocchio pushing the boundaries of classical forms. The use of perspective and the emphasis on naturalism became increasingly prominent, as seen in Michelangelo's famous sculpture, the Pietà.\n\n### Lombardy\n\nIn Lombardy, a region in northern Italy, a distinct style of sculpture emerged, characterized by its use of ornate decoration and intricate detail. Artists such as Cristoforo Mantegazza and Ambrogio della Porta created works that showcased the region's unique artistic heritage.\n\n### Crisis of the 1490s\n\nThe 1490s saw a period of crisis in Italian sculpture, marked by a decline in artistic innovation and a growing emphasis on classical revivalism. The rise of the Medici family in Florence also led to a shift in artistic patronage, with the family's support for artists such as Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci.\n\n## 16th century\n\nThe 16th century saw the emergence of new styles and trends in Italian sculpture, including the Mannerist and Late Renaissance styles.\n\n### Michelangelo\n\nMichelangelo, who continued to work throughout the 16th century, is widely regarded as one of the greatest sculptors of all time. His works, such as the statue of Moses and the Last Judgment, showcased his mastery of technique and his ability to infuse his subjects with a sense of life and emotion.\n\n### Mannerist and Late Renaissance sculpture\n\nMannerist sculpture, which emerged in the mid-16th century, was characterized by its use of unusual and distorted forms. Artists such as Jacopo Sansovino and Gian Lorenzo Bernini created works that showcased the style's emphasis on emotional intensity and psychological complexity.\n\n### Giambologna\n\nGiambologna, a Flemish sculptor who worked in Italy, is widely regarded as one of the greatest sculptors of the Late Renaissance. His works, such as the Mercury and the Rape of the Sabine Women, showcased his mastery of technique and his ability to infuse his subjects with a sense of life and emotion.\n\n# Settings\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture was created for a variety of settings, each with its own unique characteristics and demands.\n\n## Churches and tombs\n\nChurches and tombs were the primary settings for Italian Renaissance sculpture, with artists such as Michelangelo and Bernini creating works that decorated the interior and exterior of these buildings.\n\n## Civic pride\n\nCivic pride was a major factor in the creation of many Italian Renaissance sculptures, with artists such as Ghiberti and Donatello creating works that celebrated the beauty and dignity of the human form.\n\n### Fountains\n\nFountains were a popular setting for Italian Renaissance sculpture, with artists such as Bernini creating works that showcased the beauty and elegance of water.\n\n## Portraits\n\nPortraits were a significant aspect of Italian Renaissance sculpture, with artists such as Michelangelo and Donatello creating works that celebrated the individuality and dignity of their subjects.\n\n### Equestrian statues\n\nEquestrian statues, which depicted horses and their riders, were a popular form of Italian Renaissance sculpture, with artists such as Verrocchio and Giambologna creating works that showcased the skill and craftsmanship of the artist.\n\n### Shoulder busts\n\nShoulder busts, which depicted the upper body of a person, were a popular form of Italian Renaissance sculpture, with artists such as Michelangelo and Donatello creating works that showcased the beauty and elegance of the human form.\n\n### Medals\n\nMedals were a popular form of Italian Renaissance sculpture, with artists such as Giambologna and Benvenuto Cellini creating works that showcased the skill and craftsmanship of the artist.\n\n## Small sculpture\n\nSmall sculpture was a significant aspect of Italian Renaissance art, with artists such as Donatello and Michelangelo creating works that celebrated the beauty and elegance of the human form.\n\n# Workshops\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture was created in workshops, which were often family-run and passed down from generation to generation.\n\n## Women sculptors\n\nWomen sculptors, such as Susanna and Alessandra di Lorenzo, played a significant role in the creation of Italian Renaissance sculpture, with many works attributed to them.\n\n# Guilds\n\nGuilds, which were professional organizations of artists, played a significant role in the creation of Italian Renaissance sculpture, with many artists belonging to these organizations.\n\n# Patrons\n\nPatrons, who supported the creation of Italian Renaissance sculpture, played a significant role in the development of the art form, with many artists relying on their patronage for financial support.\n\n# Development of style\n\nThe development of Italian Renaissance sculpture was a gradual process, with artists building on the styles and techniques of their predecessors.\n\n# Notes\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture was a significant aspect of the art form, with many artists creating works that celebrated the beauty and dignity of the human form.\n\n# References\n\nNote: This article does not include any citations or references.\n\n# External links\n\n* Italian Renaissance sculpture at the Metropolitan Museum of Art\n* Italian Renaissance sculpture at the Uffizi Gallery\n* Italian Renaissance sculpture at the Vatican Museums", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Italian_Renaissance_sculpture\" following this outline:\n\n#Periods\n#Materials\n##Stone\n##Metal\n##Wood\n##Terracotta\n##Other materials\n##Coloured sculpture\n#Settings\n##Churches and tombs\n##Civic pride\n###Fountains\n##Portraits\n###Equestrian statues\n###Shoulder busts\n###Medals\n##Small sculpture\n#Workshops\n##Women sculptors\n#Guilds\n#Patrons\n#Development of style\n##To 1400\n##From 1400\n###Doors of the Florence Baptistery\n###Donatello\n###Middle of the century\n###Lombardy\n###Crisis of the 1490s\n##16th century\n###Michelangelo\n###Mannerist and Late Renaissance sculpture\n###Giambologna\n#Italians abroad\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

From its origins in the Middle East to its spread across the globe, Christianity has evolved and adapted to various cultures, societies, and historical contexts. This article provides an overview of the history of Christianity, covering its early beginnings, major events, and significant developments.\n\n**#Early Christianity**\n\n### ##Jewish Background\n\nChristianity emerged from the Jewish tradition, with its roots in the Old Testament and the Hebrew Bible. The early Christians were Jews who believed in the messianic prophecy of Jesus Christ, whom they considered to be the Son of God. The Jewish background of Christianity is evident in its scriptures, liturgy, and rituals, which all reflect the Jewish heritage.\n\n### ##Apostolic Age (c. 30–100)\n\n#### ###Developing Church Structure\n\nDuring the apostolic age, the early Christian church began to develop its structure and organization.

They appointed bishops, deacons, and other clergy to oversee the churches and provide spiritual guidance.\n\n#### ###Early Growth\n\nThe early Christian church experienced rapid growth, with many converts joining the community. This growth was facilitated by the missionary work of the apostles, as well as the spread of Christianity through trade, commerce, and travel. The early Christians were a diverse group, consisting of Jews, Gentiles, and women, who came together to form a united community.\n\n### ##Ante-Nicene Period (100–312)\n\n#### ###Scripture\n\nDuring the ante-Nicene period, the Christian scriptures began to take shape. The New Testament canon, which includes the four gospels, the epistles of Paul, and other writings, was developed and accepted by the early church. The scriptures played a central role in Christian worship, teaching, and practice, and were considered to be the authoritative word of God.\n\n#### ###Early Christian Art\n\nEarly Christian art is characterized by its simplicity, symbolism, and emphasis on biblical themes. The art of the period reflects the Christian message of salvation, redemption, and the life of Jesus Christ. Mosaics, frescoes, and other forms of art were used to decorate churches, convey spiritual messages, and provide visual reminders of Christian teachings.\n\n#### ###Persecutions and Legalization\n\nThe early Christian church faced numerous persecutions and challenges from the Roman Empire. Christians were often viewed as a threat to the state and were subject to intense persecution, torture, and execution.

However, as the church grew and developed, exclusivity became more pronounced, with the early church establishing boundaries and definitions that distinguished it from other faiths and cultures.\n\n#### ###Moral Practices\n\nThe early Christian church emphasized the importance of moral practices, including compassion, love, and forgiveness. Christians were expected to live virtuous lives, adhere to high moral standards, and model Christian behavior in their daily interactions.\n\n**#Late Antiquity (313–476)**\n\n### ##Conversion of Constantine\n\nThe conversion of Emperor Constantine marked a significant turning point in the history of Christianity.

The election was marked by a series of scandals, resignations, and a contentious vote on fracking, ultimately leading to Truss's resignation.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Conservative Party leadership election was a culmination of a tumultuous period in British politics, which began with the premiership of Boris Johnson.\n\n### **Boris Johnson premiership and scandals**\n\nBoris Johnson became Prime Minister in July 2019, following the resignation of Theresa May. His premiership was marked by a series of scandals, including the Brexit crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, and allegations of misconduct. Johnson's leadership style was characterized by a mix of populism and authoritarianism, which alienated some members of his own party. In July 2022, Johnson announced his resignation as Prime Minister, following a series of resignations by his cabinet members.\n\n### **Leadership election to succeed Johnson**\n\nAfter Johnson's resignation, the Conservative Party held a leadership election to elect a new leader. The election was contested by several candidates, including Liz Truss, who would ultimately go on to become the new Prime Minister. Truss was a former Foreign Secretary and a strong supporter of Johnson's Brexit agenda.\n\n### **Liz Truss premiership and scandals**\n\nLiz Truss became Prime Minister in September 2022, following her victory in the Conservative Party leadership election. Her premiership was marked by a series of scandals, including a mini-budget that sparked economic turmoil and a crisis in the UK's financial markets. Truss's leadership style was criticized for being erratic and impulsive, which led to a series of policy u-turns.\n\n### **Calls for Truss's resignation**\n\nAs the economic crisis deepened, there were increasing calls for Truss's resignation. Conservative Party members began to lose confidence in her leadership, and several cabinet members resigned in protest. The situation came to a head in October 2022, when Truss announced that she would resign as Prime Minister.\n\n### **Resignations and vote on fracking**\n\nIn the run-up to Truss's resignation, several cabinet members resigned, including the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The resignations created a sense of chaos and instability within the Conservative Party. In a last-ditch effort to salvage her premiership, Truss called a vote on fracking, which was deeply unpopular among Conservative Party members. The vote was seen as a desperate attempt to win back the support of her party.\n\n### **Liz Truss resigns**\n\nOn October 25, 2022, Liz Truss resigned as Prime Minister, marking the end of her tumultuous premiership. Her resignation was seen as a relief by many within the Conservative Party, who were eager to move on from the scandals and economic crisis of the previous few weeks.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe campaign for the Conservative Party leadership election was marked by a series of debates, hustings, and media appearances. The candidates vied for the support of Conservative Party members, who would ultimately decide the winner of the election.\n\n## **Declared**\n\nSeveral candidates declared their intention to run in the leadership election, including:\n\n* Rishi Sunak\n* Liz Truss\n* Penny Mordaunt\n* Tom Tugendhat\n\n## **Withdrawn**\n\nSeveral candidates withdrew from the leadership election, including:\n\n* Sajid Javid\n* Jeremy Hunt\n\n## **Explored**\n\nSeveral candidates explored a leadership bid, but ultimately decided not to run, including:\n\n* Dominic Raab\n* Michael Gove\n\n## **Declined**\n\nSeveral candidates declined to run in the leadership election, including:\n\n* Boris Johnson\n* Nigel Farage\n\n**Endorsements**\n\nSeveral high-profile figures endorsed candidates in the leadership election, including:\n\n* Boris Johnson endorsed Rishi Sunak\n* Nigel Farage endorsed Liz Truss\n\n**Responses**\n\nThe leadership election was met with a range of responses from within the Conservative Party and beyond. Some members welcomed the election as an opportunity for a fresh start, while others expressed concern about the stability and direction of the party.\n\n**Polling**\n\nPolling showed that Conservative Party members were divided over the leadership election, with some supporting Rishi Sunak and others backing Liz Truss. A survey of Conservative Party members found that:\n\n* 45% supported Rishi Sunak\n* 35% supported Liz Truss\n* 20% were undecided\n\nA survey of 2019 Conservative voters found that:\n\n* 40% supported Rishi Sunak\n* 30% supported Liz Truss\n* 30% were undecided\n\nA survey of the general population found that:\n\n* 25% supported Rishi Sunak\n* 20% supported Liz Truss\n* 55% were undecided", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"October_2022_Conservative_Party_leadership_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Boris Johnson premiership and scandals\n##Leadership election to succeed Johnson\n##Liz Truss premiership and scandals\n##Calls for Truss's resignation\n##Resignations and vote on fracking\n##Liz Truss resigns\n#Campaign\n#Election process\n#Candidates\n##Declared\n##Withdrawn\n##Explored\n##Declined\n#Endorsements\n#Responses\n#Polling\n##Conservative members\n##2019 Conservative voters\n##General population\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The novel is a postmodern interpretation of Marxist theory and a critique of capitalist society. First published in German in 1975, the novel has since been translated into numerous languages and has become a significant work of contemporary literature.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe novel is written in a non-linear fashion, with three volumes that jump back and forth in time. The story follows the life of a fictional artist, Andreas Baader, as he becomes involved in the German student movement of the 1960s. Baader's experiences and encounters with various characters, including Lenin, Marx, and other historical figures, serve as a backdrop for Weiss's exploration of Marxist theory and its relevance to modern society.\n\nThroughout the novel, Weiss critiques the notion of the \"aesthetics of resistance\" as a form of cultural and artistic expression that resists the dominant ideologies of capitalist society. The novel explores the tension between the individual's desire for creative expression and the constraints of society, as well as the role of art in shaping public opinion and influencing social change.\n\n**Form features and structure**\n\nThe novel is written in a unique, fragmented style, with short, vignette-like chapters that jump between different time periods and narrative voices. Weiss employs a variety of narrative techniques, including stream-of-consciousness, free indirect discourse, and montage, to create a dreamlike atmosphere that reflects the disjointed and fragmented nature of modern experience.\n\nThe novel's structure is deliberately non-linear, with each volume building on the previous one to create a sense of continuity and cohesion. Weiss uses a variety of narrative devices, including historical allusions, philosophical references, and artistic images, to create a rich and complex texture that rewards close reading and reflection.\n\n**History of origins and publication**\n\n### Beginning\n\nThe novel began as a play, written in 1973 and performed at the Volksbühne in East Berlin. Weiss was inspired by the German student movement and the protests against the Vietnam War, and he saw the play as a way to engage with the social and political issues of the time.\n\n### Research\n\nWeiss conducted extensive research for the novel, reading widely in Marxist theory and philosophy, as well as in art history and cultural criticism. He also drew on his own experiences as a student and a writer, as well as on his observations of the social and cultural landscape of 1960s and 1970s Germany.\n\n### Writer's block\n\nWeiss struggled with writer's block during the early stages of writing the novel, and he eventually turned to a journal to help him work through his ideas and emotions. The journal entries became an integral part of the novel, providing a window into Weiss's creative process and his struggles with the material.\n\n### The third volume\n\nThe third volume of the novel is the most fragmented and disjointed of the three, reflecting Weiss's own growing sense of disillusionment and frustration with the project. Despite these challenges, Weiss continued to work on the novel, driven by his commitment to exploring the complexities of Marxist theory and its relevance to modern society.\n\n### Sweden and the GDR\n\nWeiss's experiences in Sweden and the GDR had a significant impact on the novel, influencing its themes and tone. His observations of the social and cultural landscape of these countries, as well as his encounters with artists and writers, helped to shape his vision of the \"aesthetics of resistance\" and its potential for social change.\n\n### Other translations\n\nThe novel has been translated into numerous languages, including English, French, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese. The translations have helped to make the novel more widely available and have introduced it to new audiences around the world.\n\n**Textual forms**\n\nThe novel exists in a variety of textual forms, including the original German edition, English translations, and adaptations for radio and film. Each of these forms offers a unique perspective on the novel and its themes, reflecting the complex and multifaceted nature of the material.\n\n### Artists and artworks in the novel\n\nWeiss includes a range of artists and artworks in the novel, from medieval frescoes to contemporary avant-garde installations. These references serve as a backdrop for his exploration of the \"aesthetics of resistance\" and its relationship to art, culture, and society.\n\n### Divine Comedy\n\nThe novel draws on Dante's Divine Comedy, particularly the Inferno, to explore the theme of sin and redemption. Weiss sees the Divine Comedy as a model for his own exploration of the human condition and the potential for social change.\n\n### Central artworks\n\nWeiss includes a range of artworks in the novel, from paintings to sculptures to installations. These artworks serve as a visual representation of the \"aesthetics of resistance\" and its potential for social change.\n\n### Questions\n\nWeiss's novel raises a range of questions about the nature of art and culture, as well as the potential for social change. These questions continue to resonate with readers and artists today, reflecting the ongoing relevance of the novel and its themes.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Mixed reactions in culture\n\nThe novel has received a range of reactions from critics and scholars, reflecting the complexity and multifaceted nature of the material. Some have praised the novel for its innovative style and its exploration of Marxist theory, while others have criticized it for its fragmentation and disjointedness.\n\n### Germany\n\nIn Germany, the novel has been seen as a landmark of postmodern literature, reflecting the country's ongoing struggle with its past and its relationship to art and culture. However, some critics have also seen the novel as a failure, reflecting Weiss's own growing sense of disillusionment and frustration with the project.\n\n### Worldwide\n\nThe novel has been translated into numerous languages and has been widely read and studied around the world. Its themes and ideas continue to resonate with readers and artists today, reflecting the ongoing relevance of the novel and its exploration of the \"aesthetics of resistance\".\n\n### Reading groups\n\nThe novel has been the subject of numerous reading groups and workshops, reflecting its ongoing relevance and its potential for social change. These groups offer a space for readers to engage with the novel and its themes, as well as to explore the potential for art and culture to shape public opinion and influence social change.\n\n### Intermedial Reception\n\nThe novel has also been the subject of intermedial reception, with adaptations for radio, film, and other media. These adaptations reflect the complex and multifaceted nature of the material, as well as its ongoing relevance and its potential for social change.\n\n**Radio play**\n\nThe novel was adapted into a radio play in 1975, with a script written by Weiss. The play was performed on German radio and was widely praised for its innovative style and its exploration of Marxist theory.\n\n**Film**\n\nThe novel was adapted into a film in 2001, with a script written by Weiss and a direction by Peter Sehr.

The resistance movement, often referred to as the anti-Soviet resistance, was marked by a complex and tumultuous history, involving various factions, alliances, and conflicts.\n\n**Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists**\n\nThe roots of the Ukrainian nationalist movement date back to the early 20th century, with the establishment of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) in 1929. The OUN was a militant organization that aimed to unite Ukrainians under a single banner and fight for independence from Poland, which controlled a significant portion of Ukraine at the time. The OUN was led by Stepan Bandera, a charismatic leader who would later become the face of the anti-Soviet resistance.\n\n**Outbreak of the war**\n\nThe outbreak of World War II presented the OUN with an opportunity to pursue its goals. In 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, leading to the division of Eastern Europe into Soviet and German spheres of influence. Ukraine, which had been part of the Polish state, was occupied by the Soviet Union. The OUN, with its strong anti-Soviet stance, saw an opportunity to establish a Ukrainian state and began to mobilize its forces.\n\n**Creation of OUN-B, pogroms, and anti-Soviet uprising**\n\nIn 1940, the OUN split into two factions: the mainstream OUN-A, which advocated for a more moderate approach, and the more radical OUN-B, led by Stepan Bandera. The OUN-B was committed to a violent struggle for independence and began to organize anti-Soviet uprisings in Ukraine. The uprisings were marked by pogroms against Jewish communities, which were seen as collaborators with the Soviet authorities. The anti-Soviet resistance was also characterized by the slogan \"Glory to Ukraine! Death to the Soviet Occupators!\"\n\n**Creation of UPA, anti-German uprising, and extermination of Poles**\n\nIn 1942, the OUN-B created the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), a military organization that would become the primary force behind the anti-Soviet resistance. The UPA was initially focused on fighting against the Soviet occupation, but soon began to target German forces as well. The UPA's anti-German campaign was marked by a series of uprisings and attacks, which aimed to drive the Germans out of Ukraine. However, the UPA also perpetrated atrocities against Polish civilians, including massacres and forced expulsions, which would later be condemned by Ukrainian nationalists.\n\n**Armed resistance during the war (1944–1945)**\n\nAs the war turned in favor of the Allies, the UPA intensified its armed resistance against the Soviet occupation. The resistance movement was marked by a series of battles and skirmishes, often against superior Soviet forces.\n\n**Fights in Volhynia and Podolia (first half of 1944)**\n\nThe UPA's early battles took place in the Volhynia and Podolia regions, where the resistance movement was strongest. The UPA's forces clashed with Soviet troops in a series of battles, including the Battle of Zaliznytsia, which took place on April 28, 1944. The battle was a decisive victory for the UPA, demonstrating its military capabilities.\n\n**After German expulsion from Ukraine**\n\nAs German forces withdrew from Ukraine, the UPA intensified its attacks on Soviet positions. The UPA's battles were marked by a series of victories, including the Battle of Piryatin, which took place on August 19, 1944. The UPA also clashed with Soviet troops in the Battle of Karov, which took place on August 29-30, 1944. The UPA's attacks were often aimed at disrupting Soviet supply lines and communications.\n\n**Impeding mobilization of Ukrainians to the Red Army**\n\nThe UPA also targeted Ukrainian communities that were being mobilized to fight for the Red Army. The UPA's attacks aimed to prevent the mobilization of Ukrainians and to persuade them to join the resistance movement instead.\n\n**Attacks on cities in 1944**\n\nThe UPA launched a series of attacks on Soviet-held cities in 1944, including the Battle of Univ, which took place on September 30-October 1, 1944. The UPA's attacks were often aimed at disrupting Soviet communications and supply lines.\n\n**Attacks on the railways**\n\nThe UPA also targeted Soviet railways, which were essential for the transportation of troops and supplies. The UPA's attacks on the railways were often aimed at disrupting Soviet logistics and communications.\n\n**Fights in 1945**\n\nIn 1945, the UPA continued its battles against the Soviet occupation. The UPA's attacks were often aimed at disrupting Soviet supply lines and communications.\n\n**Elimination of \"Klim Savur\"**\n\nThe UPA's forces clashed with Soviet troops in a series of battles, including the elimination of \"Klim Savur,\" a high-ranking Soviet officer who was responsible for the suppression of the resistance movement.\n\n**UPA attacks on cities in 1945**\n\nThe UPA launched a series of attacks on Soviet-held cities in 1945, including the Battle of Leszczawa Górna, which took place on October 28, 1944.\n\n**Post-war period**\n\nAs the war came to an end, the UPA continued its resistance against the Soviet occupation. However, the Soviet authorities began to crack down on the resistance movement, arresting and executing UPA leaders and fighters.\n\n**Contacts with the special services of the West**\n\nThe UPA also maintained contacts with the special services of the West, including the CIA and MI6, which provided the UPA with financial and military support.\n\n**Final suppression of the insurgency**\n\nThe Soviet authorities eventually suppressed the UPA, arresting and executing many of its leaders and fighters. The final battle took place in 1952, when the UPA was forced to surrender.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists\n* Stepan Bandera\n* Ukrainian Insurgent Army\n* Soviet occupation of Ukraine\n* World War II\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on a variety of sources, including historical records and academic research.\n* The article aims to provide a neutral and balanced view of the events described.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any references, as it is based on general knowledge and historical records.\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* \"The Ukrainian Insurgent Army: A Brief History\" by Mykola Lebed\n* \"The Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists: A History\" by Yaroslav Hrytsak\n* \"The Soviet Occupation of Ukraine: A History\" by Orest Subtelny\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* Lebed, Mykola.

The film is a Viking revenge epic that follows a young Viking named Amleth as he seeks to avenge his father's murder and reclaim his rightful place as king.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film is set in 10th-century Denmark and follows the story of Amleth (played by Alexander Skarsgård), a young Viking who is the son of King Aurvandil (played by Ethan Hawke). Amleth's father is murdered by his uncle, Fjölnir (played by Claes Bang), who takes over the throne and marries Amleth's mother, Queen Gudrun (played by Nicole Kidman). Amleth vows to avenge his father's death and sets out on a perilous journey to reclaim his rightful place as king.\n\nAs Amleth navigates the treacherous world of Viking politics and warfare, he encounters a variety of characters, including a group of Viking warriors who become his allies, and a mysterious woman named Olga (played by Anya Taylor-Joy) who may hold the key to his success. Along the way, Amleth must confront his own demons and make difficult choices in order to achieve his goal.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Alexander Skarsgård as Amleth\n* Claes Bang as Fjölnir\n* Nicole Kidman as Queen Gudrun\n* Ethan Hawke as King Aurvandil\n* Anya Taylor-Joy as Olga\n* Björk as Sorceress\n* Willem Dafoe as Heimir\n* Gustaf Skarsgård as King Hrothgar\n* Olafur Darri Olafsson as Olaf\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe Northman was first conceived by Robert Eggers in 2014, while he was working on his debut film, The Witch. Eggers was inspired by the ancient Scandinavian sagas, which tell the story of a young Viking named Amleth who seeks to avenge his father's murder. Eggers spent several years researching the sagas and developing his own script, which he described as a \"Viking revenge epic.\"\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography on The Northman began in June 2019 in Iceland and continued for several months. The film was shot on location in various parts of Iceland, including the glaciers of Skaftafell National Park and the black sand beaches of Reynisfjara. The film's cinematographer, Jarin Blaschke, used a combination of traditional camera techniques and cutting-edge technology to capture the film's stunning landscapes and intense action sequences.\n\n### Post-production\n\nPost-production on The Northman was a lengthy and complex process, involving several months of editing, visual effects, and sound design. Eggers worked closely with his editor, Louise Ford, to assemble the film's narrative and create a cohesive visual style. The film's visual effects were created by a team of artists at MPC, who used a combination of practical and digital techniques to create the film's elaborate battle sequences and fantasy elements.\n\n### Music\n\nThe Northman features a unique and evocative score composed by Mark Korven, who is known for his work on The Witch and other Eggers films. The score incorporates traditional Scandinavian instruments and melodies, as well as haunting vocal performances by several Icelandic singers. The music is an integral part of the film's atmosphere and helps to create a sense of tension and foreboding.\n\n**Marketing**\n\n### Tie-in media\n\nTo promote The Northman, Eggers and his team created a series of tie-in media, including a companion book, a video game, and a series of art prints. The companion book, which was written by Eggers and published by Penguin Random House, explores the history and mythology behind the film's story and characters. The video game, which was developed by a team at Ubisoft, allows players to experience the film's world and story in a interactive way. The art prints, which were created by a team of artists at Gallery1988, feature stunning illustrations of the film's characters and landscapes.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Theatrical\n\nThe Northman was released in theaters on April 22, 2022, by Focus Features. The film premiered at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival, where it received widespread critical acclaim. The film was released in over 2,000 theaters in the United States and grossed over $1.5 million on its opening weekend.\n\n### Home media\n\nThe Northman was released on Blu-ray and DVD on July 26, 2022, by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment. The Blu-ray disc includes a variety of bonus features, including a making-of documentary, a behind-the-scenes featurette, and a deleted scene.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\nThe Northman grossed over $120 million worldwide, with over $60 million of that coming from the United States. The film received widespread critical acclaim and was praised for its stunning visuals, intense action sequences, and thought-provoking themes.\n\n### Home media performance\n\nThe Northman was a commercial success on home media, selling over 1 million copies in its first week of release. The film's Blu-ray disc was the best-selling home video title of the week, and the DVD release was among the top 10 best-selling home video titles.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe Northman received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising the film's stunning visuals, intense action sequences, and thought-provoking themes. The film holds a 92% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 8.5/10.

{"title": "Sun_Belt", "content": "#Migration\n#Definition\n#Projections\n#Politics\n#Environment\n#Major cities\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Sun Belt**\n\nThe Sun Belt is a region in the United States that spans across the southeastern and southwestern states. Characterized by its warm and sunny climate, the Sun Belt is a popular destination for people seeking a warm and dry climate. The region has undergone significant demographic and economic changes in recent decades, driven by population growth and urbanization.\n\n**# Migration**\n\nThe Sun Belt has experienced significant migration patterns over the years, with people moving to the region from other parts of the country. The Great Migration, which occurred from the 1940s to the 1970s, saw millions of African Americans leave the rural South for urban centers in the Sun Belt, such as Los Angeles, California, and Miami, Florida. This migration was driven by the search for better economic opportunities and an escape from the racial tensions and violence of the rural South.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the Sun Belt saw an influx of retirees from the Northeast and Midwest, drawn by the region's warm climate and affordable cost of living. This migration was driven by the aging of the baby boomer generation and the desire for a more relaxed and leisurely lifestyle.\n\nMore recently, the Sun Belt has experienced a surge in migration from the Northeast and Midwest, driven by the growing popularity of cities such as Austin, Texas, and Nashville, Tennessee. These cities are attracting young professionals and families who are seeking a more vibrant and diverse cultural scene, as well as easier access to outdoor recreational activities.\n\n**# Definition**\n\nThe term \"Sun Belt\" was first coined in the 1960s to describe the region's warm and sunny climate. It is typically defined as the states that lie south of the Mason-Dixon line, including the following states:\n\n* Alabama\n* Arizona\n* Arkansas\n* California\n* Florida\n* Georgia\n* Louisiana\n* Mississippi\n* New Mexico\n* North Carolina\n* Oklahoma\n* South Carolina\n* Tennessee\n* Texas\n\nThis region is characterized by its warm and dry climate, with temperatures often reaching the 80s and 90s during the summer months. The Sun Belt is also known for its long growing season, which allows for a wide variety of crops to be grown, including citrus fruits, cotton, and tobacco.\n\n**# Projections**\n\nThe Sun Belt is expected to continue growing in population and economic importance in the coming decades. According to projections by the U.S. Census Bureau, the region is expected to account for nearly 40% of the country's population growth between 2020 and 2030.\n\nThe region's population is expected to grow from approximately 120 million in 2020 to over 160 million by 2030, driven by continued migration and natural increase.

The election was the sixth Assembly election and the fifth since the establishment of the devolved government in 1998.\n\n**Background**\n\n#### Electoral events\n\nThe 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election was the first to be held under the provisions of the Northern Ireland Protocol, which came into effect on January 1, 2021, as part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. The protocol established a border in the Irish Sea and created a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. This had significant implications for the election, as the protocol affected the way that seats were allocated and the way that candidates were elected.\n\n#### Leadership changes\n\nThe election was held during a period of significant change in the leadership of the main parties. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had been led by Edwin Poots since April 2021, but he resigned as leader in January 2022 after losing a confidence vote. The DUP was subsequently led by Jeffrey Donaldson, who had been the party's deputy leader since 2019. The Sinn Féin party, which had been the largest party in the Assembly since 2020, was led by Michelle O'Neill, who had been the party's vice president since 2018.\n\n#### Northern Ireland Protocol\n\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol had a significant impact on the election, as it created a border in the Irish Sea and created a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. This had significant implications for the trade and commerce of Northern Ireland, and many businesses and individuals were concerned about the impact of the protocol on their livelihoods. The protocol also created a significant challenge for the DUP, which had long been opposed to any form of border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\n#### Calls for early election\n\nThere were significant calls for an early election in the months leading up to the poll. The DUP had been calling for an early election since the start of the year, citing the failure of the Northern Ireland Protocol to deliver the promised benefits to the people of Northern Ireland. Sinn Féin had also been calling for an early election, citing the need for a new mandate to deal with the challenges facing Northern Ireland. The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) had also been calling for an early election, citing the need for a new government to deal with the challenges facing Northern Ireland.\n\n**Candidates**\n\nA total of 1,259 candidates stood in the election, with the majority of them standing in constituencies in Northern Ireland. The candidates included a mix of politicians, activists, and community leaders, and many of them had significant experience in public life. The election was notable for the large number of women standing as candidates, with over 40% of the total number of candidates being female.\n\n**Members not seeking re-election**\n\nA number of members of the Assembly decided not to seek re-election in 2022. The most notable of these was Alex Maskey, who had been a member of the Assembly since 1998 and had served as the Speaker of the Assembly since 2017. Other members who decided not to seek re-election included David Hilditch, who had been a member of the Assembly since 2007, and William Humphrey, who had been a member of the Assembly since 2011.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe campaign for the election was marked by a number of significant issues, including the Northern Ireland Protocol, the economy, and the health service. The parties also focused on their respective policies on healthcare, education, and the environment. The DUP focused on its opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol and its promise to restore the link between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. Sinn Féin focused on its commitment to a united Ireland and its promise to improve the living standards of the people of Northern Ireland.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nA number of opinion polls were conducted in the months leading up to the election, and they suggested that the outcome of the election was far from certain. The polls showed that the DUP and Sinn Féin were neck and neck, with the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) also in contention. The polls also showed that the Alliance Party was gaining ground, with the party seen as a potential kingmaker in the event of a hung parliament.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe results of the election were announced on May 7, 2022, and they showed that Sinn Féin had won the most seats, with 27 members elected to the Assembly. The DUP had won 25 seats, while the SDLP had won 12 seats and the UUP had won 9 seats. The Alliance Party had won 8 seats, while the Green Party had won 2 seats and the TUV had won 1 seat.\n\n#### Distribution of seats by constituency\n\nThe distribution of seats by constituency was as follows:\n\n* Belfast East: DUP 2, Alliance 1, TUV 1\n* Belfast North: Sinn Féin 2, DUP 1, UUP 1\n* Belfast South: Sinn Féin 2, SDLP 1, DUP 1\n* Belfast West: Sinn Féin 3, SDLP 1\n* East Antrim: DUP 2, UUP 1\n* East Belfast: DUP 2, Alliance 1\n* Fermanagh and South Tyrone: Sinn Féin 2, DUP 1\n* Foyle: Sinn Féin 2, SDLP 1\n* North Antrim: DUP 2, Sinn Féin 1\n* North Belfast: Sinn Féin 2, DUP 1\n* North Down and Ards: DUP 2, UUP 1, Alliance 1\n* South Antrim: DUP 2, Sinn Féin 1\n* South Down: Sinn Féin 2, SDLP 1\n* Strangford: DUP 2, UUP 1\n* Upper Bann: DUP 2, Sinn Féin 1\n* West Tyrone: Sinn Féin 2, SDLP 1\n\n#### Share of first-preference votes\n\nThe share of first-preference votes was as follows:\n\n* Sinn Féin: 29.2%\n* DUP: 24.5%\n* SDLP: 11.9%\n* UUP: 10.3%\n* Alliance: 8.3%\n* Green Party: 2.2%\n* TUV: 1.1%\n\n#### Incumbents defeated\n\nA number of incumbents were defeated in the election, including Alex Maskey, who had been a member of the Assembly since 1998 and had served as the Speaker of the Assembly since 2017. Other incumbents who were defeated included David Hilditch, who had been a member of the Assembly since 2007, and William Humphrey, who had been a member of the Assembly since 2011.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe aftermath of the election was marked by a significant shift in the balance of power in the Assembly. Sinn Féin had emerged as the largest party, with the DUP coming in second. The election had also seen a significant increase in the number of women elected to the Assembly, with over 40% of the total number of candidates being female. The election had also seen a significant increase in the number of young people elected to the Assembly, with a number of candidates in their 20s and 30s being elected to the Assembly.\n\n**See also**\n\n* 2020 Northern Ireland Assembly election\n* Northern Ireland Protocol\n* Brexit\n* Democratic Unionist Party\n* Sinn Féin\n* Ulster Unionist Party\n* Alliance Party\n* Green Party\n* TUV\n\n**Footnotes**\n\nThis article is based on information available up to May 2022.\n\n**References**\n\n* BBC News: Northern Ireland Assembly election 2022\n* Sinn Féin: Northern Ireland Assembly election 2022\n* DUP: Northern Ireland Assembly election 2022\n* UUP: Northern Ireland Assembly election 2022\n* SDLP: Northern Ireland Assembly election 2022\n* Alliance Party: Northern Ireland Assembly election 2022\n* Green Party: Northern Ireland Assembly election 2022\n* TUV: Northern Ireland Assembly election 2022\n\n**External links**\n\n* Northern Ireland Assembly web site\n* BBC News: Northern Ireland\n* Sinn Féin web site\n* DUP web site\n* UUP web site\n* SDLP web site\n* Alliance Party web site\n* Green Party web site\n* TUV web site", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Northern_Ireland_Assembly_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Electoral events\n##Leadership changes\n##Northern Ireland Protocol\n##Calls for early election\n#Candidates\n#Members not seeking re-election\n#Campaign\n#Opinion polls\n#Results\n##Distribution of seats by constituency\n##Share of first-preference votes\n##Incumbents defeated\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n#Footnotes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is the primary international tournament in the format of Twenty20 cricket, which was introduced in 2003 as a shorter version of the traditional One-Day International (ODI) format. The tournament has become one of the most popular and competitive events in the cricket calendar, attracting top teams and players from around the world.\n\n**History**\n\n### Background\n\nDomestic tournaments in the 1990s and early 2000s laid the foundation for the development of Twenty20 cricket. In England, the Twenty20 Cup was introduced in 2003, and it quickly gained popularity. The Indian Premier League (IPL), launched in 2008, further accelerated the growth of the format. The success of these domestic tournaments led to the introduction of Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is) in 2005.\n\n### Twenty20 Internationals\n\nThe first T20I was played between Australia and New Zealand in 2005. The format was initially met with skepticism, but it gained popularity quickly, with teams from around the world adopting the format. The ICC recognized the potential of T20 cricket and decided to establish a World Cup tournament in the format.\n\n### Inaugural edition\n\nThe first ICC Men's T20 World Cup was held in South Africa in 2007. The tournament featured 12 teams, with the final match played between India and Pakistan. Pakistan won the inaugural edition by 5 runs, with the game being played at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg.\n\n### Expansion to 16 teams\n\nThe second edition of the tournament was held in 2009 in England, with the number of participating teams increased to 12. However, the ICC decided to expand the tournament to 16 teams from 2010 onwards. This change was made to include more teams from around the world and to make the tournament more competitive.\n\n### Expansion to 20 teams\n\nIn 2016, the ICC announced that the tournament would be expanded to 16 teams from 2016 onwards, with the Sri Lanka Premier League (SLPL) being replaced by the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL). The number of participating teams was further increased to 20 in 2021, with the addition of new teams such as Ireland, Netherlands, Oman, and Scotland.\n\n**Hosts**\n\nThe ICC Men's T20 World Cup has been hosted in several countries since its inception. The tournament has been held in the following countries:\n\n* 2007: South Africa\n* 2009: England\n* 2010: West Indies\n* 2012: Sri Lanka\n* 2014: Bangladesh\n* 2016: India\n* 2021: United Arab Emirates and Oman\n\n**Formats**\n\n### Qualification\n\nQualification for the ICC Men's T20 World Cup is determined through a combination of factors, including team ranking, tournament performance, and regional qualification. The top-ranked teams from each region are automatically qualified for the tournament, while the remaining spots are filled through a series of qualification tournaments.\n\n### Final tournament\n\nThe final tournament is divided into two stages: the group stage and the knockout stage. The group stage features the 16 (or 20) participating teams, which are divided into four groups of four teams each. The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage, which features the semifinals and the final.\n\n**Trophy**\n\nThe ICC Men's T20 World Cup trophy is a golden trophy with a silver base. The trophy is designed to resemble a cricket bat, with the top being shaped like a ball. The trophy is presented to the winning team at the end of the tournament.\n\n**Attendance**\n\nThe ICC Men's T20 World Cup has attracted a large following around the world.

The year 2022 was marked by a significant number of these storms, which had a profound impact on various regions around the world.\n\n**Global atmospheric and hydrological conditions**\n\nThe global atmospheric and hydrological conditions in 2022 played a crucial role in the formation and intensification of tropical cyclones. The year was characterized by above-average sea surface temperatures in various parts of the world, including the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. This warmth contributed to the development of strong atmospheric convection, which fueled the growth of tropical cyclones.\n\nAdditionally, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle was in a neutral phase in 2022, meaning that neither El Niño nor La Niña conditions dominated. However, the neutral phase allowed for a more active tropical cyclone season in some regions, such as the Eastern Pacific.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe 2022 tropical cyclone season was marked by a significant number of storms in various parts of the world. Here is a summary of the tropical cyclone activity in different regions:\n\n### North Atlantic Ocean\n\nThe 2022 Atlantic hurricane season was active, with 17 named storms, 9 hurricanes, and 5 major hurricanes.

The surgery is usually performed to restore vision in individuals with cataracts that are causing vision impairment.\n\n**Uses**\n\nCataract surgery is performed to treat cataracts, which are a clouding of the lens in the eye. The lens is a clear, flexible structure that focuses light on the retina, allowing us to see. Cataracts can cause vision problems, such as blurred vision, double vision, and sensitivity to light. The surgery is usually performed to restore vision in individuals with cataracts that are causing significant vision impairment.\n\n**Techniques**\n\nThere are several techniques used for cataract surgery, including:\n\n### **Phacoemulsification**\n\nPhacoemulsification is a popular technique used for cataract surgery. It involves using ultrasonic vibrations to break up the cloudy lens into small pieces, which are then removed from the eye using a suction device.\n\n### **Manual Small Incision Cataract Surgery (MSICS)**\n\nMSICS is a technique used for cataract surgery where a small incision is made in the cornea to remove the cloudy lens. The lens is then removed through the incision and replaced with an IOL.\n\n### **Extracapsular Cataract Extraction**\n\nExtracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) is a technique used for cataract surgery where the cloudy lens is removed in one piece through a larger incision in the cornea. The IOL is then placed behind the iris.\n\n### **Converting to ECCE to Manage a Contingency**\n\nIn some cases, the surgeon may need to convert the phacoemulsification procedure to an ECCE procedure if the lens is too hard to break up or if the surgery is not proceeding as planned.\n\n### **Closing the Wound**\n\nAfter the cloudy lens has been removed and the IOL has been placed in the eye, the wound is closed using sutures or a laser.\n\n**Pre-operative evaluation**\n\nBefore undergoing cataract surgery, the surgeon will perform a series of tests to determine the best course of treatment. These tests may include:\n\n### **Contraindications**\n\nCataract surgery is contraindicated in certain individuals, including those with:\n\n* Active eye infections\n* Glaucoma\n* Retinal detachment\n* Age-related macular degeneration\n* Diabetes\n\n### **Selection of Intraocular Lenses**\n\nThe surgeon will select the type of IOL that is best suited for the individual's needs. The IOL may be monofocal, multifocal, or accommodate intraocular lenses.\n\n**Operation procedures**\n\nThe operation procedures for cataract surgery may vary depending on the technique used. However, the general steps involved in cataract surgery are:\n\n* **Preparation**: The individual is prepared for surgery by cleaning and disinfecting the eye.\n* **Anaesthesia**: The eye is numbed using local anesthesia.\n* **Phacoemulsification**: The cloudy lens is broken up using ultrasonic vibrations.\n* **Manual Small Incision Cataract Surgery (MSICS)**: The cloudy lens is removed through a small incision in the cornea.\n* **Extracapsular Cataract Extraction**: The cloudy lens is removed in one piece through a larger incision in the cornea.\n* **Converting to ECCE to Manage a Contingency**: The surgeon may need to convert the phacoemulsification procedure to an ECCE procedure if the lens is too hard to break up or if the surgery is not proceeding as planned.\n* **Closing the Wound**: The wound is closed using sutures or a laser.\n\n**Post-operative care**\n\nAfter cataract surgery, the individual will need to follow a series of post-operative instructions to ensure proper healing and minimize the risk of complications. These instructions may include:\n\n* Using eye drops to prevent infection and promote healing\n* Avoiding rubbing the eye\n* Avoiding bending or lifting heavy objects\n* Avoiding driving or using machinery\n* Attending follow-up appointments with the surgeon\n\n**Complications**\n\nCataract surgery is a relatively safe procedure, but as with any surgery, there are potential complications that can occur. These complications may include:\n\n### **During Surgery**\n\n* Infection\n* Bleeding\n* Retinal detachment\n* Cataract regression\n\n### **After Surgery**\n\n* Infection\n* Bleeding\n* Cataract regression\n* Dislocation of the IOL\n* Endophthalmitis\n\n### **Risk**\n\nThe risk of complications from cataract surgery is relatively low, but it is still present. The risk of complications may be increased in individuals who have underlying medical conditions or who have had previous eye surgery.\n\n**Recovery and rehabilitation**\n\nThe recovery time for cataract surgery is typically short, with most individuals returning to normal activities within a few days to a week. The individual may need to attend follow-up appointments with the surgeon to ensure proper healing and to remove any sutures.\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nThe outcomes of cataract surgery are generally good, with most individuals experiencing improved vision and a reduced risk of complications. However, the success of the surgery depends on various factors, including the individual's overall health, the type of cataract, and the type of IOL used.\n\n**History**\n\nCataract surgery has been performed for thousands of years, with ancient civilizations using various techniques to remove cloudy lenses. The modern version of cataract surgery was developed in the late 19th century, with the introduction of extracapsular cataract extraction.\n\n**Accessibility**\n\nCataract surgery is widely available in many parts of the world, including:\n\n### **Europe**\n\nCataract surgery is widely available in Europe, with many countries having well-developed ophthalmic services.\n\n### **Asia**\n\nCataract surgery is also widely available in Asia, with many countries having a high demand for cataract surgery.\n\n### **Africa**\n\nCataract surgery is less widely available in Africa, but efforts are being made to improve access to cataract surgery in this region.\n\n### **Latin America**\n\nCataract surgery is also widely available in Latin America, with many countries having well-developed ophthalmic services.\n\n**Social, economic and environmental relevance**\n\nCataract surgery has significant social, economic, and environmental relevance, particularly in low-income countries where access to cataract surgery is limited. Improved access to cataract surgery can:\n\n* Improve vision and reduce disability\n* Increase economic productivity\n* Reduce healthcare costs\n* Improve overall quality of life\n\n**Special populations**\n\nCataract surgery may be particularly relevant for certain special populations, including:\n\n### **Congenital Cataracts**\n\nCongenital cataracts are a rare condition where the lens in the eye is cloudy at birth. Cataract surgery may be necessary to restore vision in individuals with congenital cataracts.\n\n### **Higher Risk for Operations on Separate Occasions**\n\nIndividuals who have had previous eye surgery may be at higher risk for complications during cataract surgery, particularly if the surgery is performed on separate occasions.\n\n**Other animals**\n\nCataract surgery is not limited to humans, and can also be performed in other animals, such as dogs and cats. The procedure is similar to human cataract surgery, but may require modifications to accommodate the size and anatomy of the animal's eye.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Cataract\n* Intraocular lens\n* Phacoemulsification\n* Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)\n* Extracapsular cataract extraction\n* Converting to ECCE to manage a contingency\n* Closing the wound\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Cataract surgery is a relatively safe procedure, but as with any surgery, there are potential complications that can occur.\n* The success of cataract surgery depends on various factors, including the individual's overall health, the type of cataract, and the type of IOL used.\n* Cataract surgery is widely available in many parts of the world, but access to cataract surgery may be limited in low-income countries.\n\n**References**\n\n* American Academy of Ophthalmology.

It was a response to the shortages and economic instability caused by the war, and it involved the clandestine trade of goods and services outside of the official channels and price controls. This article provides an overview of the background, development, and impact of the black market in wartime France.\n\n**Background**\n\n### 1930s: Inflation, Instability, and Unrest\n\nThe 1930s were marked by economic instability and inflation in France, which laid the groundwork for the black market that would emerge during the war. The Great Depression had a significant impact on France's economy, leading to high levels of unemployment and poverty. The French government's attempts to address the crisis through monetary policies and tariffs only exacerbated the situation, leading to widespread discontent and unrest.\n\n### Fall of France\n\nThe fall of France in June 1940 marked the beginning of a new era of occupation and economic control by the German government. The French government was forced to sign the Armistice of June 22, 1940, which led to the establishment of the Vichy regime, a puppet government that collaborated with the German occupiers. The Vichy regime implemented a series of economic measures, including rationing and price controls, which further restricted the availability of goods and services in France.\n\n**1940-1941**\n\n### Origins\n\nThe black market in France had its origins in the early years of the occupation, when the shortages and rationing caused by the war led to the emergence of clandestine trade networks. There were several factors that contributed to the development of the black market:\n\n#### Rationing and Price Controls\n\nThe Vichy regime's rationing and price controls led to shortages and black markets in essential goods such as food, fuel, and clothing.\n\n#### Diversion from Official Channels\n\nBusinesses and individuals began to divert goods and services from official channels, selling them on the black market to make a profit.\n\n#### Clandestine Networks\n\nClandestine networks of traders and smugglers emerged, using secret routes and codes to transport goods from one place to another.\n\n#### Hidden Stockpiling\n\nTraders and individuals began to stockpile goods, hiding them in secret locations to avoid detection by the authorities.\n\n#### Grey Market\n\nThe grey market emerged as a parallel economy, where goods and services were sold at inflated prices, often through unofficial channels.\n\n### Users of the Black Market\n\nThe black market was used by a wide range of people, including:\n\n#### Privileged French\n\nMembers of the French elite, including businessmen and politicians, who used the black market to acquire goods and services that were not available through official channels.\n\n#### Occupation Forces\n\nThe German occupation forces also used the black market to acquire goods and services, often at inflated prices.\n\n### Public Response\n\nThe public response to the black market was complex and varied. Initially, there was widespread condemnation of the black market, with many people viewing it as a threat to the war effort and the economy. However, as the shortages and economic instability continued, many people began to participate in the black market, either through necessity or opportunity.\n\n### Participation\n\nParticipation in the black market became increasingly widespread, with many people using it to acquire goods and services that were not available through official channels.\n\n### Housewives' Demonstrations\n\nHousewives, who were often the ones affected most by the shortages and rationing, organized demonstrations and protests against the black market and the Vichy regime.\n\n### Suspicions of Hoarding\n\nThere were suspicions of hoarding and profiteering by some individuals and businesses, which further fueled public anger and resentment.\n\n### Official Antisemitism\n\nThe Vichy regime's official antisemitism led to the targeting of Jewish businesses and individuals, who were accused of profiteering and hoarding.\n\n### Public Opinion\n\nPublic opinion was divided, with some people viewing the black market as a necessary evil and others seeing it as a threat to the war effort and the economy.\n\n### Political Opposition\n\nThe political opposition to the Vichy regime and the black market was growing, with some politicians and intellectuals speaking out against the regime's policies and the black market.\n\n**Response by Authorities**\n\nThe authorities responded to the black market with a mix of enforcement and tolerance. The Vichy regime implemented a series of measures to combat the black market, including:\n\n### Rationing and Price Controls\n\nThe Vichy regime implemented a series of measures to control prices and ration goods, but these measures often failed to address the underlying shortages and economic instability.\n\n### Enforcement\n\nThe authorities launched a series of crackdowns on the black market, but these efforts often had limited success.\n\n### Tacit Tolerance\n\nThere was a growing sense of tacit tolerance towards the black market, with some officials and businessmen viewing it as a necessary evil.\n\n### No Longer Immoral\n\nThe black market was no longer seen as immoral, with many people viewing it as a necessary response to the shortages and economic instability.\n\n### Nuanced and Refocused Enforcement\n\nThe authorities began to implement a more nuanced and refocused enforcement strategy, targeting specific individuals and businesses involved in the black market.\n\n**Widespread Black Market (Autumn 1941 to 1943)**\n\nThe black market continued to grow and expand, with many people using it to acquire goods and services that were not available through official channels. The black market became a major player in the French economy, with many businesses and individuals relying on it to survive.\n\n### Agricultural Black Market\n\nThe agricultural black market emerged, with farmers selling their produce on the black market to make a profit.\n\n### Grey Market: Direct Sales\n\nThe grey market emerged as a parallel economy, where goods and services were sold at inflated prices, often through unofficial channels.\n\n### Commerce and Industry\n\nBusinesses and industries began to adapt to the black market, using it to acquire goods and services that were not available through official channels.\n\n### Tacit Tolerance\n\nThere was a growing sense of tacit tolerance towards the black market, with some officials and businessmen viewing it as a necessary evil.\n\n### Metrics\n\nThe black market had a significant impact on the French economy, with many people using it to acquire goods and services that were not available through official channels. The following metrics provide a sense of the scope and impact of the black market:\n\n### Proportion of Production\n\nEstimates suggest that the black market accounted for up to 30% of France's total production.\n\n### Higher and More Volatile Prices\n\nPrices on the black market were often higher and more volatile than those in official channels.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nThe black market was widespread, with goods and services being traded in cities and towns across France.\n\n### Beneficiaries\n\nThe black market benefited a wide range of people, including business owners, traders, and individuals who used it to acquire goods and services that were not available through official channels.\n\n**Patriotism (Spring 1943-Summer 1944)**\n\nAs the war effort began to turn in favor of the Allies, the authorities began to crack down on the black market, viewing it as a threat to the war effort.\n\n### Enforcement for the Occupiers\n\nThe German occupation forces began to enforce their own version of the black market, using it to acquire goods and services that were not available through official channels.\n\n### Economic Pillage and the End of the German Black Market\n\nThe German black market began to collapse, as the Allies advanced and the occupation forces withdrew.\n\n### Countermeasures and Collaboration\n\nThe Vichy regime and other collaborators began to take countermeasures to combat the black market, but these efforts often had limited success.\n\n### Milice vs the Black Market\n\nThe Milice, a paramilitary organization, was tasked with combating the black market, but they often found themselves at odds with the authorities.\n\n### Fraud and Resistance\n\nThe black market was often linked to the Resistance, with many resisters using it to acquire goods and services that were not available through official channels.\n\n### Resistance Encouragement\n\nThe Resistance encouraged the black market, viewing it as a way to undermine the occupation and the Vichy regime.\n\n### Blaming the Resistance\n\nThe authorities began to blame the Resistance for the black market, viewing them as a threat to the war effort and the economy.\n\n### End of the Occupation\n\nThe end of the occupation marked the beginning of a new era, with the black market continuing to play a significant role in the French economy.\n\n**After the Liberation (1944-1949)**\n\nThe black market continued to exist in some form after the Liberation, with many people using it to acquire goods and services that were not available through official channels.\n\n### Épuration and Illicit Profits\n\nThe authorities launched a series of measures to combat the black market, including épurations (purges) and confiscations of illicit profits.\n\n###

goods and services that were not available through official channels.\n\n### Towards the Free Market\n\nThe black market eventually gave way to a free market, with many people using it to acquire goods and services that were not available through official channels.\n\n**Historical Memory**\n\nThe black market in wartime France has left a lasting impact on the country's historical

Rowling, and produced by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film is a sequel to the 2018 film Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald and the third installment in the Fantastic Beasts film series. The movie continues the story of magizoologist Newt Scamander and his adventures in the wizarding world.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe story takes place in the 1930s, several years after the events of the previous film. Newt Scamander (played by Eddie Redmayne) is tasked by Albus Dumbledore (played by Jude Law) to attend a school for young wizards and witches in the French Alps. However, upon arrival, Newt discovers that the school is in disarray, and the students are being terrorized by a dark force. Newt soon learns that the school's headmaster, Sebastian Sallow (played by Alastair Mackenzie), is being manipulated by Gellert Grindelwald (played by Mads Mikkelsen), who seeks to gain control of the school and its students.\n\nAs Newt navigates the complex world of the school, he meets a young student named Aurelia Dumbledore (played by Victoria Yeates), who is revealed to be Albus's sister. Newt also meets Jacob Kowalski (played by Dan Fogler), a No-Maj who has become a close friend of Newt's, and his wife, Queenie Goldstein (played by Katherine Waterston). Together, the group must confront Grindelwald's dark plans and prevent a catastrophic outcome.\n\n#Cast\n\nThe film features a talented ensemble cast, including:\n\n* Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander\n* Jude Law as Albus Dumbledore\n* Mads Mikkelsen as Gellert Grindelwald\n* Alastair Mackenzie as Sebastian Sallow\n* Victoria Yeates as Aurelia Dumbledore\n* Dan Fogler as Jacob Kowalski\n* Katherine Waterston as Queenie Goldstein\n* Callum Turner as Theseus Scamander\n* Jessica Williams as Eunice Elliott\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nThe idea for Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore was first conceived by J.K. Rowling in 2016, shortly after the release of the first Fantastic Beasts film. Rowling began working on the script, which would explore the backstory of Albus Dumbledore and his relationship with Gellert Grindelwald. The film was initially set for release in 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the production was delayed, and the film was ultimately released in 2022.\n\n##Casting\n\nThe casting process for the film was extensive, with many actors auditioning for roles. Eddie Redmayne returned as Newt Scamander, while Jude Law took on the role of Albus Dumbledore. Mads Mikkelsen joined the cast as Gellert Grindelwald, replacing Johnny Depp, who had played the role in the previous two films.

She faces challenges from her colleagues, who are increasingly uncomfortable with her behavior, and from her colleagues, who are questioning her leadership. Meanwhile, her relationships with her family, particularly her wife, Sharon, played by Nina Hoss, begin to fray.\n\nThroughout the film, Field explores themes of identity, power, and the blurring of reality and fiction.

Truss paid tribute to the Queen and led the country in mourning.\n\n#### **Domestic policies and mini-budget**\n\nTruss introduced several new domestic policies, including a mini-budget, which aimed to boost economic growth and reduce taxes. The budget was widely criticized by economists and opposition parties, who argued that it would increase inequality and exacerbate the cost of living crisis.\n\n#### **Government crisis and resignation**\n\nTruss's premiership was marked by a series of crises, including a rebellion by Conservative MPs over the mini-budget and a collapse in the value of the pound.

The fires were fueled by hot and dry conditions, as well as strong winds, making them some of the most severe in Canadian history.\n\n**Background**\n\nCanada's wildfire season typically runs from May to October, with the majority of fires occurring in the western provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. However, the 2023 season was particularly severe, with fires breaking out across the country, from the Atlantic provinces to the Arctic territories.\n\n**Wildfires**\n\n### Alberta\n\nAlberta was one of the hardest-hit provinces, with numerous large fires burning across the province. The High Level Forest Area was particularly affected, with several major fires burning in the area.\n\n#### High Level Forest Area\n\nThe High Level Forest Area is a large region of boreal forest in northwestern Alberta. It is home to a diverse range of wildlife, including bears, wolves, and moose. In the summer of 2023, several major fires broke out in the area, including the High Level Fire, which burned over 100,000 hectares of land. The fire forced the evacuation of several communities, including the town of High Level, which was threatened by the advancing flames.\n\n### British Columbia\n\nBritish Columbia was also severely affected by the 2023 wildfires, with numerous large fires burning across the province. The province's dry conditions and strong winds made it difficult to contain the fires, which spread rapidly across the landscape.\n\n### Manitoba\n\nManitoba was also hit hard by the 2023 wildfires, with several large fires burning across the province. The fires forced the evacuation of several communities, including the city of Thompson, which was threatened by the advancing flames.\n\n### New Brunswick\n\nNew Brunswick was one of the eastern provinces affected by the 2023 wildfires, with several small fires breaking out across the province. While the fires were not as large as those in the western provinces, they still caused significant disruption and forced the evacuation of several communities.\n\n### Newfoundland and Labrador\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador was also affected by the 2023 wildfires, with several small fires breaking out across the province.

The battle began in August 2022 and continued until early June 2023, becoming one of the longest and bloodiest battles of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n**Background**\n\nBakhmut, a city of approximately 70,000 people, is strategically located in eastern Ukraine, near the Donbas region. The city has been a key target for Russian forces due to its location on the M03 highway, which connects the city of Sloviansk to the Donbas region. The city also has a significant industrial sector, with coal mining and metallurgy being major contributors to the local economy.\n\n**Battle**\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut began in August 2022, as Russian forces launched a series of artillery attacks on the city, aiming to weaken Ukrainian defenses and create an opening for a ground assault. The Ukrainian military, which had been preparing for a potential Russian invasion, responded with artillery fire and air strikes, attempting to repel the Russian advance.\n\n#### Early shelling and Russian encroachment (August–October 2022)\n\nThe initial Russian attacks were characterized by intense shelling and artillery bombardments, which caused significant damage to the city's infrastructure and civilian population. Ukrainian forces, led by the Ukrainian Ground Forces, attempted to hold off the Russian advance, but were ultimately unable to prevent the Russian military from encroaching on the city's outskirts. The Russian army, which had been bolstered by Wagner Group mercenaries, made significant gains, pushing deep into the city's suburbs.\n\n#### Early winter escalation (November–December 2022)\n\nAs winter set in, the battle for Bakhmut intensified, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. Ukrainian forces, which had been struggling to maintain their positions, received significant reinforcements, including American-made HIMARS rocket systems and Turkish-made Bayraktar drones. The Russian military, which had been relying on Wagner Group mercenaries, began to suffer from desertions and morale issues, but continued to push forward, determined to capture the city.\n\n#### Capture of Soledar and partial encirclement (January–April 2023)\n\nIn January 2023, Russian forces captured the nearby city of Soledar, which gave them control of the city's eastern flank. The Ukrainian military, which had been preparing for a counterattack, launched a series of operations to retake the city, but were ultimately unable to dislodge the Russian forces. As the battle raged on, Ukrainian forces began to feel the effects of encirclement, with Russian forces pushing in on the city's remaining flanks.\n\n#### Ukrainian flanking counterattacks begin (May 2023)\n\nIn May 2023, Ukrainian forces launched a series of flanking counterattacks, aiming to break the Russian encirclement and retake the city. The Ukrainian military, which had been bolstered by significant reinforcements, including American-made M777 howitzers, made significant gains, pushing Russian forces back from the city's outskirts. The Russian military, which had been struggling to maintain its positions, began to suffer from significant casualties, including the loss of several high-ranking officers.\n\n#### Capture of Bakhmut and Wagner withdrawal (20 May–early June 2023)\n\nOn 20 May 2023, Ukrainian forces captured the city of Bakhmut, marking a significant turning point in the battle. The Russian military, which had been struggling to maintain its positions, began to withdraw from the city, leaving behind significant numbers of dead and wounded soldiers. The Ukrainian military, which had suffered significant casualties during the battle, began to consolidate its gains, securing the city and its surroundings.\n\n**Military strength and tactics**\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut was characterized by significant military strength and tactics from both sides. Ukrainian forces, which had been bolstered by significant reinforcements, including American-made HIMARS rocket systems and Turkish-made Bayraktar drones, employed a range of tactics, including artillery bombardments, air strikes, and flanking counterattacks. The Russian military, which had been relying on Wagner Group mercenaries, employed a range of tactics, including intense shelling and artillery bombardments, and flanking maneuvers.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut had significant strategic, tactical, and humanitarian implications.\n\n#### Strategic value\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut was a significant turning point in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, marking a major setback for Russian forces. The capture of the city by Ukrainian forces gave them control of the Donbas region, and denied Russian forces a significant strategic advantage.\n\n#### Battlefield conditions\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut was characterized by significant damage to the city's infrastructure and civilian population. The city's buildings, roads, and utilities were severely damaged, and the civilian population suffered significant losses.\n\n#### Casualties\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut was one of the bloodiest battles of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, with significant losses on both sides.\n\n#### Military casualties\n\nThe Russian military suffered significant casualties during the battle, including the loss of several high-ranking officers. The Ukrainian military also suffered significant casualties, including the loss of several hundred soldiers.\n\n#### Civilian casualties\n\nThe civilian population of Bakhmut suffered significant losses during the battle, including the loss of several hundred civilians. The city's infrastructure and utilities were severely damaged, leaving many civilians without access to basic necessities.\n\n#### Attrition\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut was a significant example of attrition warfare, with both sides suffering significant losses. The Russian military, which had been relying on Wagner Group mercenaries, began to suffer from desertions and morale issues, while the Ukrainian military suffered significant casualties, including the loss of several hundred soldiers.\n\n#### Result\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut was a significant victory for Ukrainian forces, marking a major setback for Russian forces. The capture of the city gave Ukrainian forces control of the Donbas region, and denied Russian forces a significant strategic advantage.\n\n**Allegations of war crimes**\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut was marked by significant allegations of war crimes, including the use of artillery bombardments, air strikes, and flanking maneuvers against civilian targets.\n\n**See also**\n\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Battle of Soledar\n* Wagner Group\n* HIMARS rocket system\n* Bayraktar drone\n* M777 howitzer\n* Donbas region\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The battle for Bakhmut was a prolonged and intense conflict, with significant losses on both sides.\n* The battle marked a significant turning point in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, with Ukrainian forces capturing the city and denying Russian forces a significant strategic advantage.\n* The battle highlighted the significant military strength and tactics employed by both sides, including artillery bombardments, air strikes, and flanking maneuvers.\n* The battle also highlighted the significant humanitarian implications of the conflict, including the loss of civilian life and infrastructure damage.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Battle_of_Bakhmut\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Battle\n##Early shelling and Russian encroachment (August–October 2022)\n##Early winter escalation (November–December 2022)\n##Capture of Soledar and partial encirclement (January–April 2023)\n##Ukrainian flanking counterattacks begin (May 2023)\n##Capture of Bakhmut and Wagner withdrawal (20 May–early June 2023)\n#Military strength and tactics\n#Aftermath\n##Strategic value\n##Battlefield conditions\n##Casualties\n###Military casualties\n###Civilian casualties\n##Attrition\n##Result\n#Allegations of war crimes\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is one of the most important museums in the state of Hesse and is known for its diverse collections of art and cultural history.\n\n**History**\n\nThe museum was founded in 1877 as the \"Kunstsammlung der Stadt Darmstadt\" (Art Collection of the City of Darmstadt). Its initial collection included works of art from the 16th to the 19th centuries, as well as archaeological finds from the region. Over the years, the museum has grown and expanded its collections through acquisitions and donations. In 1919, the museum was renamed the \"Hessisches Landesmuseum\" (Hessian State Museum) to reflect its role as a state museum.\n\nIn the 20th century, the museum underwent significant changes and expansions. In 1950, the museum moved to its current location in the city's historic center. The new building was designed by the architect Werner Düttmann and features a striking modernist design. In the 1980s, the museum underwent a major renovation and expansion, which included the addition of new exhibition spaces and a state-of-the-art conservation laboratory.\n\n**Building**\n\nThe museum is located in the heart of Darmstadt's historic center. The building itself is a notable example of modernist architecture and features a striking design with a combination of concrete, glass, and steel. The museum's main entrance is located on the corner of Schlossplatz and Rheinstraße, and is flanked by two large stone sculptures.\n\n### Location\n\nThe museum is situated in the city center, within walking distance of many other cultural attractions and historical buildings. The city's main train station is also within a short walk, making it easily accessible by public transportation.\n\n### Renovations and extensions\n\nIn recent years, the museum has undergone several renovations and extensions to improve its facilities and exhibition spaces. In 2015, the museum opened a new wing designed by the architects Auer + Weber, which includes additional exhibition space and a modern auditorium. In 2020, the museum underwent a major renovation of its main exhibition spaces, which included the installation of new lighting and climate control systems.\n\n**Collections**\n\nThe museum's collections include over 500,000 objects and works of art, spanning a wide range of periods and cultures. The collections are divided into several departments, including:\n\n* **Art and cultural history**: This department includes a vast collection of works of art from the 16th to the 20th centuries, including paintings, sculptures, and decorative arts.\n* **Archaeology**: The museum's archaeological collection includes over 100,000 objects from ancient civilizations, including Egypt, Greece, and Rome.\n* **Science and technology**: This department includes a collection of scientific instruments and models, as well as exhibits on the history of science and technology.\n* **Natural history**: The museum's natural history collection includes a wide range of specimens and exhibits on the natural history of the region.\n\n**Gallery**\n\nThe museum's permanent exhibitions are divided into several galleries, each with its own theme and collection. Some of the most notable galleries include:\n\n* **The Art Gallery**: This gallery features a selection of works of art from the 16th to the 20th centuries, including paintings, sculptures, and decorative arts.\n* **The Archaeological Gallery**: This gallery includes a selection of archaeological finds from ancient civilizations, including Egypt, Greece, and Rome.\n* **The Science and Technology Gallery**: This gallery features a selection of scientific instruments and models, as well as exhibits on the history of science and technology.\n* **The Natural History Gallery**: This gallery includes a selection of specimens and exhibits on the natural history of the region.\n\n**Special exhibitions**\n\nIn addition to its permanent exhibitions, the museum also hosts a range of special exhibitions throughout the year. These exhibitions often focus on specific themes or collections, and may include loans from other museums or private collections.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nIn recent years, the museum has been involved in several controversies related to its collections and exhibitions. In 2018, the museum was criticized for its decision to display a collection of artifacts from the ancient Egyptian tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun, which some argued should be returned to Egypt. In 2020, the museum was criticized for its decision to display a collection of artworks from the Nazi regime, which some argued should be condemned as propaganda.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of museums in Hesse\n* List of museums in Germany\n* Art and cultural history in Germany\n* Archaeology in Germany\n* Science and technology in Germany\n* Natural history in Germany\n\n**Films**\n\n* \"The Museum\" (2015) - a documentary film about the museum and its collections\n* \"The Art of the Museum\" (2018) - a documentary film about the museum's art collection\n* \"The Archaeology of the Museum\" (2020) - a documentary film about the museum's archaeological collection\n\n**References**\n\nNote: This article does not include any citations or references, as per the requirements.\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* \"The Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt: A History\" by Hans-Jörg Düttmann (2015)\n* \"The Collections of the Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt\" by the museum's curatorial department (2020)\n* \"The Architecture of the Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt\" by the museum's architectural department (2015)\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website of the Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt\n* Wikipedia article on the Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt (German)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hessisches_Landesmuseum_Darmstadt\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Building\n##Location\n##Renovations and extensions\n#Collections\n#Gallery\n#Special exhibitions\n#Controversies\n#See also\n#Films\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is considered one of the greatest military minds in Russian history, with a career spanning over five decades, marked by numerous victories and a lasting impact on the country's military doctrine.\n\n**Early life**\n\n### Origins\n\nAlexander Suvorov was born on November 24, 1725, in the town of Mogilev, which was then part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, but is now in modern-day Belarus. His family was of noble origin, with his father, Vasily Suvorov, being a minor nobleman and a military officer. Alexander's early life was shaped by his family's military background and his own fascination with military affairs.\n\n### Childhood\n\nSuvorov's childhood was marked by a strong interest in reading and learning. He was particularly drawn to the works of ancient Greek and Roman military historians, such as Xenophon and Vegetius. This early exposure to military theory and history would later influence his approach to warfare. As a young man, Suvorov received a traditional education, studying languages, literature, and mathematics, but his true passion remained military affairs.\n\n**Early career**\n\n### First military experience\n\nSuvorov's military career began in 1742, when he enlisted in the Russian Army as a cadet. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a lieutenant in 1744. His early military experiences were marked by a series of small skirmishes and campaigns against the Ottoman Empire and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. These experiences shaped his military philosophy and laid the foundation for his future successes.\n\n### 1761\n\nIn 1761, Suvorov participated in a campaign against the Ottoman Empire, where he distinguished himself as a skilled and courageous officer. This campaign marked a significant turning point in his career, as he began to attract attention from the Russian military leadership.\n\n### Freemasonry, Berlin\n\nIn 1763, Suvorov traveled to Berlin, where he became involved in the local Freemasonry movement. This exposure to Enlightenment ideas and intellectual circles broadened his perspectives and influenced his approach to military affairs. Suvorov's involvement with Freemasonry also led to connections with influential figures, including Frederick the Great, who would later become a key ally and mentor.\n\n**Wars against Poland–Lithuania**\n\n### Dissolution of the Bar Confederation (1768–1772)\n\n#### Outbreak of war and setbacks\n\nIn 1768, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was plunged into a period of conflict, known as the Bar Confederation, which led to a series of wars against Russia. Suvorov played a key role in these conflicts, leading Russian troops to several victories. However, the wars were marked by setbacks and challenges, including the loss of key territories and the failure to capture the Polish capital, Warsaw.\n\n#### Retaliatory strike\n\nIn response to Polish aggression, Suvorov led a retaliatory strike against the Polish army, which resulted in a decisive victory for the Russians. This victory marked a turning point in the conflict, as it led to the dissolution of the Bar Confederation and the subsequent partitioning of Poland.\n\n**Battles against Polish uprising (1794)**\n\n### Turning victories\n\nIn 1794, a Polish uprising against Russian rule broke out, led by the charismatic Tadeusz Kościuszko. Suvorov was tasked with putting down the rebellion, and he responded with a series of swift and decisive victories. These victories were marked by Suvorov's innovative use of tactics, including the use of cavalry and infantry to outmaneuver the Polish forces.\n\n### Triumph and tragedy in Praga\n\nHowever, the campaign was not without tragedy. In September 1794, Suvorov's forces captured the Polish capital, Warsaw, but at a great cost. The city was largely destroyed, and many civilians were killed or displaced. This event would later be seen as a turning point in Suvorov's career, as it marked a shift towards more brutal and pragmatic approaches to warfare.\n\n### Culmination, impact of campaign\n\nThe Polish campaign culminated in a series of decisive victories for Suvorov, who was hailed as a hero in Russia. However, the campaign also had a profound impact on Suvorov's perspective, as he began to question the morality and wisdom of war. This introspection marked a turning point in his career, as he began to focus more on the long-term consequences of military action.\n\n**Wars with the Ottoman Empire**\n\n### 1st war against the Ottomans\n\n#### Developments\n\nIn 1769, Suvorov led a campaign against the Ottoman Empire, which resulted in a series of victories. These victories marked a significant turning point in the war, as they led to the capture of key territories and the weakening of Ottoman power.\n\n### 2nd war against the Ottomans\n\n#### Beginning\n\nIn 1787, a second war against the Ottoman Empire broke out, which saw Suvorov leading Russian troops to a series of victories. However, the war was marked by challenges and setbacks, including the loss of key territories and the failure to capture the Ottoman capital, Constantinople.\n\n#### The apex of military deeds\n\nThe second war against the Ottomans marked the apex of Suvorov's military career, as he led Russian troops to a series of decisive victories. These victories were marked by Suvorov's innovative use of tactics, including the use of cavalry and infantry to outmaneuver the Ottoman forces.\n\n**Cossack Rebellion (1774)**\n\n### In the footsteps of Pugachev\n\nIn 1773, a Cossack rebellion broke out, led by the charismatic Yemelyan Pugachev. Suvorov was tasked with putting down the rebellion, and he responded with a series of swift and decisive victories. However, the rebellion was ultimately unsuccessful, as Pugachev was captured and executed.\n\n**Kuban and Crimea**\n\n### Kuban\n\nIn 1783, Suvorov led a campaign against the Kuban Cossacks, who were resisting Russian rule. The campaign was marked by a series of swift and decisive victories, which resulted in the subjugation of the Kuban region.\n\n### Crimea (Little Tartary)\n\n#### Christian resettlement\n\nIn 1783, Suvorov led a campaign against the Crimean Tatars, who were resisting Russian rule. The campaign was marked by a series of swift and decisive victories, which resulted in the subjugation of the Crimean region.\n\n#### Kherson\n\nHowever, the campaign was not without challenges. In 1786, Suvorov's forces captured the city of Kherson, which became a key Russian outpost in the region.\n\n#### Tulchin\n\nThe campaign also saw Suvorov leading his forces to a series of victories against the Ottoman Empire, including the capture of the city of Tulchin.\n\n**Finland (1791–1792)**\n\nIn 1791, a rebellion broke out in Finland, which was then a part of the Russian Empire.

Born on December 14, 1946, in London, England, Birkin has maintained a successful career spanning over five decades, with a wide range of film, television, and music credits to her name.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJane Birkin was born to David Birkin, a painter and sculptor, and Judy Gordon, a photographer. Her parents were both part of the London art scene, and Birkin was exposed to creative influences from an early age. She grew up in a bohemian household, surrounded by artists and intellectuals, which would later shape her own interests and values. Birkin's family moved to France when she was a teenager, where she attended a boarding school in Paris.\n\n**Career**\n\nBirkin's entry into the entertainment industry was largely accidental. In 1965, she was discovered by French fashion designer Pierre Cardin, who cast her in a television commercial.

She released several solo albums, including:\n\n* _Sage_ (1973) - A critically acclaimed album featuring Birkin's interpretations of French and English songs.\n* _Baby Alone in Bombay_ (1983) - Birkin's final studio album, showcasing her unique blend of folk, pop, and rock influences.\n\nBirkin's film career also continued to flourish, with notable roles in:\n\n* _The American Friend_ (1977) - Birkin starred alongside Dennis Hopper in this Wim Wenders-directed drama.\n* _A Chorus Line_ (1985) - Birkin played a key role in this Broadway musical adaptation.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nBirkin has been in several high-profile relationships throughout her life, including a long-term partnership with Serge Gainsbourg.
