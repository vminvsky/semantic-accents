From its humble beginnings in the mid-19th century to its current status as a global phenomenon, rock climbing has undergone significant transformations, driven by technological advancements, changing societal values, and the contributions of pioneering individuals.\n\n**Origins**\n\nThe origins of rock climbing are closely tied to the history of mountaineering, which dates back to the early 17th century. During this period, European explorers and mountaineers began to conquer the highest peaks in the Alps, laying the groundwork for the development of rock climbing as we know it today. However, the early history of rock climbing is often shrouded in mystery, and it is difficult to pinpoint exactly when and where the first rock climbing expedition took place.\n\nOne of the earliest recorded instances of rock climbing dates back to 1770, when a group of Swiss mountaineers climbed the north face of the Eiger, a notorious mountain in the Swiss Alps. This feat was considered a significant achievement at the time, but it marked only the beginning of a long and arduous journey towards the development of modern rock climbing.\n\n**19th century**\n\nDuring the 19th century, rock climbing continued to evolve, with the establishment of the Alpine Club in 1857 marking a significant milestone in the sport's history. The Alpine Club, founded by British mountaineers, aimed to promote the development of mountaineering and rock climbing, and it played a crucial role in standardizing climbing techniques, equipment, and safety protocols.\n\nThe 19th century also saw the emergence of some of the most iconic climbing routes in the world, including the Matterhorn and the Eiger. These routes, which were often considered impossible to climb, became a challenge for mountaineers and rock climbers, who sought to push the boundaries of human endurance and achievement.\n\n**1900s**\n\nThe early 20th century marked a significant turning point in the history of rock climbing, with the development of new equipment, techniques, and climbing styles. The introduction of the first climbing harnesses, carabiners, and ropes allowed climbers to tackle more challenging routes and push the limits of human endurance.\n\nOne of the most influential climbers of the early 20th century was the British mountaineer George Mallory, who attempted to climb Mount Everest in 1924. Mallory's expedition marked the beginning of a new era in high-altitude climbing, and it paved the way for future generations of climbers.\n\n**1910s**\n\nThe 1910s saw the rise of the \"Golden Age\" of climbing, during which some of the most iconic climbing routes in the world were established. The decade saw the first ascent of the Grand Traverse of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California, and the first ascent of the Matterhorn's north face.\n\nThe 1910s also saw the emergence of the climbing community as we know it today, with the establishment of the first climbing clubs and organizations. The British Mountaineering Council, founded in 1919, became one of the most influential climbing organizations in the world, and it played a key role in promoting the development of climbing and mountaineering.\n\n**1920s**\n\nThe 1920s were marked by a significant increase in climbing activity, with the establishment of new climbing routes and the development of new techniques and equipment. The decade saw the first ascent of the Eiger's north face, and the first ascent of the Grand Traverse of the Matterhorn.\n\nThe 1920s also saw the rise of the first female climbers, who began to make a name for themselves in the climbing community. Women like Annie Peck, who climbed the Matterhorn in 1908, and Ruth Mary Reynolds, who climbed the Grand Traverse of the Sierra Nevada mountains in 1911, paved the way for future generations of female climbers.\n\n**1930s**\n\nThe 1930s saw the rise of the \"Golden Age\" of climbing in the United States, during which some of the most iconic climbing routes in the world were established. The decade saw the first ascent of the Grand Traverse of the Sierra Nevada mountains, and the first ascent of the Matterhorn's north face.\n\nThe 1930s also saw the emergence of the climbing community as a distinct cultural entity, with the establishment of the first climbing clubs and organizations. The Sierra Club, founded in 1892, became one of the most influential climbing organizations in the world, and it played a key role in promoting the development of climbing and mountaineering.\n\n**1940s**\n\nThe 1940s saw a significant increase in climbing activity, with the establishment of new climbing routes and the development of new techniques and equipment. The decade saw the first ascent of the Eiger's north face, and the first ascent of the Grand Traverse of the Matterhorn.\n\nThe 1940s also saw the rise of the cold war, which had a significant impact on the climbing community. The development of new equipment and techniques, such as the use of crampons and ice axes, allowed climbers to tackle more challenging routes and push the limits of human endurance.\n\n**1950s**\n\nThe 1950s saw a significant increase in climbing activity, with the establishment of new climbing routes and the development of new techniques and equipment. The decade saw the first ascent of the Grand Traverse of the Sierra Nevada mountains, and the first ascent of the Matterhorn's north face.\n\nThe 1950s also saw the emergence of the climbing community as a global phenomenon, with the establishment of climbing clubs and organizations around the world. The International Federation of Mountaineering and Climbing, founded in 1958, became one of the most influential climbing organizations in the world, and it played a key role in promoting the development of climbing and mountaineering.\n\n**1960s**\n\nThe 1960s were marked by a significant increase in climbing activity, with the establishment of new climbing routes and the development of new techniques and equipment. The decade saw the first ascent of the Grand Traverse of the Sierra Nevada mountains, and the first ascent of the Matterhorn's north face.\n\nThe 1960s also saw the rise of the counterculture movement, which had a significant impact on the climbing community. The development of new climbing equipment and techniques, such as the use of nylon ropes and carabiners, allowed climbers to tackle more challenging routes and push the limits of human endurance.\n\n**1970s**\n\nThe 1970s saw a significant increase in climbing activity, with the establishment of new climbing routes and the development of new techniques and equipment. The decade saw the first ascent of the Grand Traverse of the Sierra Nevada mountains, and the first ascent of the Matterhorn's north face.\n\nThe 1970s also saw the emergence of the climbing community as a distinct cultural entity, with the establishment of climbing festivals and events. The first climbing festival, held in 1971, marked the beginning of a new era in climbing culture, and it paved the way for future generations of climbers.\n\n**1980s**\n\nThe 1980s saw a significant increase in climbing activity, with the establishment of new climbing routes and the development of new techniques and equipment. The decade saw the first ascent of the Grand Traverse of the Sierra Nevada mountains, and the first ascent of the Matterhorn's north face.\n\nThe 1980s also saw the rise of the \"Extreme Climbing\" movement, which emphasized the use of new and innovative equipment and techniques to tackle more challenging routes. The decade saw the first ascent of the Eiger's north face, and the first ascent of the Grand Traverse of the Matterhorn.\n\n**1990s**\n\nThe 1990s saw a significant increase in climbing activity, with the establishment of new climbing routes and the development of new techniques and equipment.

The film stars R. Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi in the lead roles. It is a remake of the 2017 Tamil film of the same name, which was also written and directed by the duo. The film follows the story of a police officer named Vikram and a gangster named Vedha, whose paths intersect in a series of intense and dramatic events.\n\nPlot\n--------\n\nThe film revolves around the lives of two men, Vikram (R. Madhavan) and Vedha (Vijay Sethupathi), who are vastly different in their backgrounds and ideologies. Vikram is a methodical and principled police officer who believes in the rule of law and upholding justice, while Vedha is a ruthless and cunning gangster who takes advantage of the system to further his interests. Their paths cross in a series of events that lead to a cat-and-mouse game between the two, with Vikram set on bringing Vedha to justice, and Vedha determined to outsmart him at every turn.\n\nAs the story unfolds, it becomes clear that Vedha is a complex and multi-dimensional character, driven by a desire for power and revenge against a system that has wronged him. Vikram, on the other hand, is a symbol of the establishment, determined to uphold the law and maintain order. The film's central theme is the clash between these two ideologies, and the consequences that follow when they come face to face.\n\nCast\n-----\n\n* R.

The film was shot on location in Chennai and other parts of Tamil Nadu, and used a mix of practical and visual effects to bring the story to life.

S., who worked closely with the directors to develop the film's soundtrack. The film's score is a mix of traditional and contemporary elements, and features a range of instruments and styles. The soundtrack was released in 2022, and features several songs that have become popular among fans of the film.\n\nMarketing\n---------\n\nThe marketing campaign for Vikram Vedha was extensive and well-planned.

The process of making pottery involves shaping, drying, and firing clay to create a hard, non-porous, and durable material. Pottery has been a significant part of human culture for thousands of years, with evidence of early pottery dating back to around 9000 BC.\n\n**Main types**\n\nPottery can be classified into several main types based on the type of clay body used and the firing temperature. The three main types of pottery are earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain.\n\n### Earthenware\n\nEarthenware pottery is made from a type of clay body that is high in silica and alumina. The clay body is often mixed with other materials such as sand and feldspar to enhance its strength and durability. Earthenware pottery is fired at a relatively low temperature, typically between 1000°C and 1200°C. The resulting product is often porous and can be prone to cracking.\n\nEarthenware pottery is commonly used for functional items such as plates, bowls, and cups. It is also often used for decorative items such as vases and ornaments. Some types of earthenware pottery are glazed, while others are left unglazed.\n\n### Stoneware\n\nStoneware pottery is made from a type of clay body that is high in silica and low in alumina. The clay body is often mixed with other materials such as feldspar and quartz to enhance its strength and durability. Stoneware pottery is fired at a higher temperature than earthenware pottery, typically between 1200°C and 1400°C. The resulting product is often impermeable and non-porous.\n\nStoneware pottery is commonly used for functional items such as plates, bowls, and cups. It is also often used for decorative items such as vases and ornaments. Some types of stoneware pottery are glazed, while others are left unglazed.\n\n### Porcelain\n\nPorcelain pottery is made from a type of clay body that is high in silica and kaolin. The clay body is often mixed with other materials such as feldspar and quartz to enhance its strength and durability. Porcelain pottery is fired at a very high temperature, typically between 1400°C and 1600°C. The resulting product is often translucent and non-porous.\n\nPorcelain pottery is commonly used for decorative items such as vases, figurines, and ornaments. It is also often used for functional items such as plates, bowls, and cups. Porcelain pottery is prized for its beauty and durability.\n\n**Archaeology**\n\nArchaeology is an important aspect of pottery study, as it allows researchers to understand the history and development of pottery-making techniques. Archaeologists use various methods to analyze pottery, including fabric analysis.\n\n### Fabric analysis\n\nFabric analysis is a technique used to determine the composition of a clay body. This involves examining the physical and chemical properties of the clay, such as its texture, color, and mineral content. Fabric analysis can provide valuable information about the origins and production techniques of a particular piece of pottery.\n\n**Clay bodies and raw materials**\n\nThe raw materials used to make pottery are typically clay, silica, and other minerals. Clay is the primary component of pottery, as it provides the structure and strength. Silica is often added to clay to enhance its durability and water-resistance.\n\nClay can be extracted from a variety of sources, including rivers, lakes, and underground deposits. The quality and type of clay can vary significantly depending on the source, which can affect the final product.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe production of pottery involves several stages, including shaping, drying, firing, and decorating.\n\n### Shaping\n\nShaping is the process of creating the desired form of the pottery. This can be done using a variety of techniques, including hand-building, throwing on a wheel, and slip-casting.\n\nHand-building involves shaping the clay by hand, using techniques such as coiling, pinching, and sculpting. Throwing on a wheel involves using a potter's wheel to shape the clay into a symmetrical form. Slip-casting involves pouring liquid clay into a mold to create a symmetrical form.\n\n### Drying\n\nDrying is the process of removing excess moisture from the clay. This can be done using a variety of methods, including air drying, oven drying, and kiln drying.\n\n### Firing\n\nFiring is the process of heating the pottery to a high temperature to achieve the desired properties. This can be done using a variety of methods, including electric kilns, gas kilns, and wood-fired kilns.\n\n### Temperature\n\nThe temperature at which the pottery is fired can significantly affect its properties. Earthenware pottery is typically fired at a lower temperature than stoneware and porcelain pottery.\n\n### Atmosphere\n\nThe atmosphere in which the pottery is fired can also affect its properties. A reducing atmosphere, which is low in oxygen, can help to prevent the formation of brown spots on the surface of the pottery.\n\n### Methods\n\nThere are several methods of firing pottery, including oxidation, reduction, and raku.\n\nOxidation firing involves heating the pottery in an atmosphere that is high in oxygen. This can help to produce a range of colors and effects on the surface of the pottery.\n\nReduction firing involves heating the pottery in an atmosphere that is low in oxygen. This can help to produce a range of colors and effects on the surface of the pottery.\n\nRaku firing involves heating the pottery in a very hot kiln, and then rapidly cooling it in cold air. This can help to produce a range of colors and effects on the surface of the pottery.\n\n### Stages\n\nThe firing stage is the final stage of the production process. This involves heating the pottery to a high temperature to achieve the desired properties.\n\n**Decorating**\n\nDecorating is the process of adding visual interest to the pottery. This can be done using a variety of techniques, including glazing, slip trailing, and underglaze painting.\n\n### Methods\n\nThere are several methods of decorating pottery, including glazing, slip trailing, and underglaze painting.\n\nGlazing involves applying a layer of glaze to the surface of the pottery. This can be done using a variety of techniques, including brushing, pouring, and dipping.\n\nSlip trailing involves applying a layer of slip to the surface of the pottery. This can be done using a variety of techniques, including pouring, brushing, and dipping.\n\nUnderglaze painting involves painting the surface of the pottery with underglaze before applying a layer of glaze. This can be done using a variety of techniques, including brush painting and stamping.\n\n**Glazing**\n\nGlazing is the process of applying a layer of glaze to the surface of the pottery. This can be done using a variety of techniques, including brushing, pouring, and dipping.\n\nGlazes can be made from a variety of materials, including clay, silica, and feldspar. They can be colored using a variety of materials, including metal oxides and carbonates.\n\n**Health and environmental issues**\n\nThe production of pottery can have health and environmental implications. The use of certain materials, such as lead and cadmium, can be hazardous to human health.\n\nThe production of pottery can also have environmental implications, such as the release of pollutants into the air and water. The use of fossil fuels in kilns can contribute to climate change.\n\n**History**\n\nPottery has been a significant part of human culture for thousands of years. The history of pottery can be divided into several periods, including the early history of pottery, and the history of pottery by region.\n\n### Early history of pottery\n\nThe early history of pottery dates back to around 9000 BC.

The exodus was triggered by a violent insurgency led by militant groups such as the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) and the Hizbul Mujahideen, which sought to establish an independent Kashmir or merge the region with Pakistan.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Kashmir Valley has a long history of Hindu and Muslim coexistence, dating back to the time of the ancient Indian kingdoms of Kashmir. However, the region's strategic location and natural resources have also made it a prize for various empires and dynasties, including the Mughal Empire, the Sikh Empire, and the British East India Company. In the early 20th century, the Kashmir Valley was a predominantly Hindu region, with a population of around 1.5 million Hindus, including the Kashmiri Pandits, who were the traditional rulers of the region.\n\n**Insurgency activity**\n\nIn the late 1980s, a separatist movement began to gain momentum in the Kashmir Valley, with militant groups such as the JKLF and the Hizbul Mujahideen emerging as the main players. The movement was fueled by a combination of factors, including a desire for self-determination, economic grievances, and a sense of resentment towards the Indian government. The militants began to target Hindus, attacking them and their properties, and warning them to leave the valley.\n\n##Attack and threats\n\nThe first major attack on Hindus in the Kashmir Valley occurred in 1989, when a group of militants stormed the home of a prominent Kashmiri Pandit leader, Lassa Kaul, and killed him along with his son. The attack was followed by a wave of threats and intimidation, as militants began to target individual Hindus, warning them to leave the valley", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Exodus_of_Kashmiri_Hindus\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Insurgency activity\n##Attack and threats\n#Aftermath\n#Rehabilitation\n#In popular culture\n##Books\n##Movies\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Heard, was a civil lawsuit filed by the American actor Johnny Depp against his ex-wife Amber Heard in 2019. The trial gained significant media attention worldwide, with many considering it a major celebrity drama. The lawsuit centered around a 2018 op-ed article written by Heard for The Washington Post, which Depp claimed contained defamatory statements about him.\n\nBackground\n\n### Depp and Heard's relationship\n\nJohnny Depp and Amber Heard began dating in 2012 and got married in 2015. Their marriage was marked by controversy, with reports of Depp's alleged substance abuse and domestic violence. In 2016, Heard filed a restraining order against Depp, accusing him of physical and emotional abuse. Depp denied the allegations, and the couple eventually separated in 2017. Their divorce was finalized in 2017.\n\n### Depp v News Group Newspapers Ltd\n\nIn 2018, Depp sued News Group Newspapers Ltd, the publisher of The Sun, over an article that alleged he was a \"wife beater.\" Depp denied the allegations, and the case was eventually settled out of court.\n\n### Heard's op-ed in The Washington Post\n\nIn December 2018, Heard wrote an op-ed article for The Washington Post titled \"I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture's wrath. That has to change.\" In the article, Heard described herself as a survivor of domestic abuse but did not mention Depp by name. Depp's lawyers argued that the article implied that Depp was the abuser, and that Heard's silence about the abuse was a false narrative.\n\n### Waldman's comments in the Daily Mail\n\nIn 2018, a Daily Mail article quoted Heard's friend and former lawyer, Laura Waldman, who stated that Heard had been honest about her relationship with Depp. Waldman's comments were seen as evidence that Heard had not fabricated the allegations against Depp.\n\nCivil action\n\n### Pre-trial developments\n\nIn 2019, Depp filed a $50 million defamation lawsuit against Heard, claiming that the op-ed article had damaged his reputation and caused him to lose business opportunities. Heard counter-sued Depp for $100 million, claiming that he had defamed her by accusing her of fabricating the allegations against him.\n\n### Trial\n\nThe trial began on April 11, 2022, in Fairfax County Circuit Court. The first witness called by Depp's lawyers was the actor's former bodyguard, Sean Viles, who testified that Depp had never shown any signs of domestic violence. Heard's lawyers then called several witnesses, including Heard's sister, Whitney Henriquez, who testified that Heard had been physically and emotionally abused by Depp.\n\n### Opening statements\n\nIn his opening statement, Depp's lawyer, Camille Vasquez, argued that Heard had fabricated the allegations against Depp in an attempt to boost her career. Heard's lawyer, Benjamin Rottenborn, countered that Depp had a history of domestic violence and that Heard had been a victim of abuse.\n\n### Testimony\n\nOver the course of several weeks, numerous witnesses testified in the trial, including Depp's ex-partners, friends, and family members. Depp himself took the stand and testified that he had never abused Heard. Heard also testified, denying that she had fabricated the allegations against Depp.\n\n### Closing arguments\n\nIn his closing argument, Depp's lawyer, Camille Vasquez, argued that Heard had acted with \"malice and ill will\" in writing the op-ed article and that Depp had been \"ruined\" by the allegations. Heard's lawyer, Benjamin Rottenborn, countered that Depp had a \"history of abuse\" and that Heard had been a victim of domestic violence.\n\n### Verdict\n\nOn June 1, 2022, the jury delivered a verdict in favor of Johnny Depp, finding that Heard had defamed him in the 2018 op-ed article. The jury awarded Depp $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages. Heard was also awarded $2 million in damages for one of the three statements made by Depp's lawyer that the jury found to be defamatory.\n\n### Post-trial motions\n\nAfter the verdict, Heard's lawyers filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the jury's verdict was \"unjust\" and that the judge had made errors in the trial. Depp's lawyers also filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that Heard's lawyers had engaged in \"misconduct\" during the trial.\n\n### Appeals, settlement and carrier lawsuit\n\nIn June 2022, Heard's lawyers announced that they would appeal the verdict. Depp's lawyers also announced that they would appeal the jury's award of $2 million in damages to Heard. In July 2022, Heard's insurance carrier, Chubb, filed a lawsuit against Heard, claiming that it had paid out $1 million in damages to Depp as part of a settlement in a separate lawsuit.\n\nReactions\n\n### Livestream\n\nThe trial was livestreamed on various social media platforms, including YouTube and Facebook. Millions of people watched the trial online, with some viewing it as a \"trainwreck\" and others as a \" soap opera.\"\n\n### Social media coverage\n\nThe trial generated significant social media coverage, with many people sharing their opinions and reactions to the trial on Twitter and other platforms. The hashtag #JusticeForJohnnyDepp was widely used on Twitter, while the hashtag #BelieveWomen was also used by supporters of Heard.\n\n### Comments by juror\n\nAfter the verdict, one of the jurors, a woman who wished to remain anonymous, commented on the trial, saying that she had been \"skeptical\" of Heard's allegations from the beginning. She added that she had been convinced by Depp's testimony and that the jury had made the \"right decision.\"\n\n### The Washington Post\n\nThe Washington Post, which published Heard's op-ed article, issued a statement after the verdict, saying that it \"stands by\" Heard's story and that the article was \"not an attack on Depp.\"\n\n### Commentary on verdict\n\nThe verdict was widely covered in the media, with many commentators expressing surprise and shock at the jury's decision. Some commentators argued that the verdict was a \"victory for men's rights\" and that it would have \"chilling effects\" on women who come forward with allegations of domestic violence. Others argued that the verdict was a \"miscarriage of justice\" and that it would have \"devastating consequences\" for Heard.\n\nMedia coverage\n\n### Film adaptation\n\nA film adaptation of the trial was released in 2022, titled \"Johnny Depp vs. Amber Heard: Aftermath.\" The film was directed by Alex Gibney and premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\n### Books\n\nSeveral books have been written about the trial, including \"Johnny Depp vs. Amber Heard: The Verdict\" by Nina Burleigh and \"The Amber Heard and Johnny Depp Show\" by Ben Child.\n\n### TV\n\nThe trial was covered extensively on television, with many news programs and talk shows devoting segments to the trial.

The system consists of a Super Heavy booster and a Starship spacecraft, designed to be capable of taking both people and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations in the solar system. The Starship program aims to create a fully reusable transportation system that can significantly reduce the cost of access to space.\n\n**Description**\n\n### **Super Heavy booster**\n\nThe Super Heavy booster is the largest member of the Starship family and serves as the first stage of the launch vehicle. It is designed to be reusable and is powered by a cluster of 33 Raptor engines, each producing 200 tons of thrust. The booster is approximately 230 feet (70 meters) tall and has a diameter of 33 feet (10 meters). The Super Heavy booster is designed to lift the Starship spacecraft into orbit, and then return to Earth to land vertically.\n\n#### **Tanks**\n\nThe Super Heavy booster has a tank system that consists of two major components: the fuel tank and the oxidizer tank. The fuel tank holds the liquid methane, while the oxidizer tank holds the liquid oxygen. The tanks are designed to be lightweight and efficient, allowing for the maximum amount of propellant to be carried.\n\n#### **Propulsion**\n\nThe Raptor engines that power the Super Heavy booster are full-flow staged combustion cycle engines, meaning that they have a high specific impulse and high thrust-to-weight ratio. Each engine has a vacuum thrust of 200 tons and a vacuum specific impulse of 360 seconds. The engines are designed to be reusable and can be fired multiple times.\n\n#### **Interstage**\n\nThe interstage is the section of the launch vehicle that connects the Super Heavy booster to the Starship spacecraft. It is designed to be a lightweight structure that can withstand the stresses of launch and re-entry. The interstage is equipped with a separation system that allows the Super Heavy booster to separate from the Starship spacecraft after the first stage has completed its firing.\n\n### **Starship spacecraft**\n\nThe Starship spacecraft is the second stage of the launch vehicle and is designed to take both people and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations in the solar system. It is approximately 164 feet (50 meters) tall and has a diameter of 30 feet (9 meters). The spacecraft has a tank system that holds liquid methane and liquid oxygen, which are used to power the Raptor engines.\n\n#### **Heat shield**\n\nThe Starship spacecraft has a heat shield that protects it from the intense heat generated during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. The heat shield is made of a ceramic material that can withstand temperatures of up to 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,760 degrees Celsius).\n\n#### **Variants**\n\nThere are several variants of the Starship spacecraft, each designed for a specific mission. The Starship Mk 1 is the original design, while the Starship Mk 2 and Starship Mk 3 are upgraded versions with improved performance and capabilities.\n\n**Raptor engine**\n\nThe Raptor engine is a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine that powers the Super Heavy booster and Starship spacecraft.

However, the roots of the school date back to 1818 when the Presentation Sisters were established in Ireland by Nano Nagle, a pioneering Irish nun.

A stampede occurred during a football match between Arema FC and Persebaya Surabaya, resulting in the deaths of 135 people and injuring over 300 others.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Kanjuruhan Stadium, with a seating capacity of over 42,000, is a multi-purpose stadium used for football, concerts, and other events. The stadium is owned and operated by PT Kanjuruhan, a subsidiary of the Indonesian Football Association (PSSI). The stadium has a complex history, with several renovations and expansions over the years.\n\nThe match between Arema FC and Persebaya Surabaya was the 36th round of the Liga 1, Indonesia's top-tier football league. Arema FC was hosting Persebaya Surabaya, a team from a rival city, in a highly anticipated match. The match had been delayed several times due to rain and other issues, and the crowd was eager to see the game.\n\n**Disaster**\n\nThe disaster occurred during the 39th minute of the match, when Persebaya Surabaya scored a goal, making the score 3-2 in their favor. The crowd, which had been restless and chanting throughout the match, suddenly surged towards the exit gates, pushing and shoving in an attempt to leave the stadium. The exit gates, which were not designed to handle such a large crowd, became jammed, trapping many fans inside.\n\nAs the crowd pushed and panicked, a stampede broke out, with fans trampling each other in an attempt to escape. The stampede quickly spread throughout the stadium, with fans fleeing in all directions. The situation was exacerbated by the lack of emergency exits and the poor design of the stadium, which made it difficult for fans to escape quickly.\n\n**Casualties**\n\nThe Kanjuruhan Stadium disaster resulted in the deaths of 135 people, with over 300 others injured.

The election took place as part of the 2022 United States elections, in which all 150 seats in the Texas House of Representatives were up for election.\n\n# Background\nThe 2022 Texas House of Representatives election was the first election held in Texas after the 2020 United States census. The census revealed that Texas had gained two congressional seats, which meant that the Texas House of Representatives would also gain two seats. This led to a significant redistricting process, in which the district boundaries were redrawn to reflect the population changes.\n\n# Redistricting\n## Seats without incumbents\nAs a result of the redistricting process, several seats in the Texas House of Representatives were left without incumbents. These seats were created due to the addition of two new districts and changes to the existing district boundaries. Some of the seats without incumbents included Districts 23, 33, 97, and 119.\n\n## Double-bunked incumbents\nIn some cases, incumbents were double-bunked, meaning that they were placed in the same district as another incumbent. This occurred in several districts, including Districts 1, 22, 43, and 63. In these districts, the incumbents were forced to run against each other in the Republican primary.\n\n# Retirements\nSeveral incumbents in the Texas House of Representatives chose not to run for re-election in 2022. These include:\n\n* Rep. Dwayne Bohac (R-Houston)\n* Rep. Giovanni Capriglioni (R-New Braunfels)\n* Rep. Sarah Davis (R-West University Place)\n* Rep. Cody Harris (R-Hillister)\n* Rep. Tom Oliverson (R-Cypress)\n\n# Special elections\nSeveral special elections were held in 2022 to fill vacancies in the Texas House of Representatives. These elections included:\n\n* District 34 (R): Won by Rep. Pat Fallon, who resigned to run for the U.S. Senate.\n* District 68 (D): Won by Rep. Celia Israel, who resigned to run for the U.S. House of Representatives.\n* District 128 (R): Won by Rep. Dan Huberty, who resigned to run for a role in the private sector.\n\n# Incumbents defeated\n## In primaries\n### Democrats\nSeveral Democratic incumbents were defeated in the 2022 primary elections. These include:\n\n* Rep. Joe Deshotel (D-Beaumont)\n* Rep. Donna Howard (D-Austin)\n* Rep. Garnet Coleman (D-Houston)\n* Rep. Gina Hinojosa (D-Austin)\n* Rep. Eddie Lucio III (D-Brownsville)\n\n### Republicans\nSeveral Republican incumbents were defeated in the 2022 primary elections. These include:\n\n* Rep. Tony Dale (R-Cedar Park)\n* Rep. Wayne Faircloth (R-District 23)\n* Rep. Jason Isaac (R-Dripping Springs)\n* Rep. Steve Toth (R-The Woodlands)\n* Rep.

The team has a rich history, having undergone significant transformations and achievements throughout its existence.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nAEL Limassol B.C. has been a prominent force in Cypriot basketball since its founding in 1966. With a storied history, the team has experienced periods of success, decline, and rebirth. AEL Limassol B.C. has not only dominated the Cypriot league but has also participated in various European competitions, including the FIBA EuroCup and the EuroChallenge. This article will delve into the team's history, its achievements, and its current status.\n\n**Founding, early years & First Golden Age (1966–1988)**\n\nAEL Limassol B.C. was founded in 1966 as the basketball section of the Limassol-based football club, AEL Limassol. The team started competing in the Cypriot basketball league and quickly gained popularity, with its first notable achievement being the championship title in the 1975-76 season. This marked the beginning of the team's first Golden Age, which would last until the end of the 1987-88 season.\n\nDuring this period, AEL Limassol B.C. established itself as a dominant force in Cypriot basketball, winning numerous championships and competing in European tournaments. The team's success can be attributed to its talented players, skilled coaches, and strong team spirit.\n\n**Decline, relegation & return to glory (1989–2001)**\n\nThe late 1980s and early 1990s marked a decline in AEL Limassol B.C.'s fortunes. The team struggled to maintain its competitiveness, and by the end of the 1990-91 season, it had been relegated to the second division. This marked the beginning of a difficult period for the team, with several consecutive seasons spent in the lower divisions.\n\nHowever, with the appointment of new management and coaching staff, AEL Limassol B.C. began to rebuild and eventually returned to the top division in the 1998-99 season. The team's return to the top tier marked the beginning of a new era, and it would go on to experience another period of success.\n\n**Second Golden Age & various European successes (2002–2010)**\n\nThe 2002-03 season marked the beginning of AEL Limassol B.C.'s second Golden Age, which would last until the end of the 2009-10 season. During this period, the team experienced significant success, both domestically and in European competitions.\n\n### The initial Dragan Raca era (2002–2005)\n\nDragan Raca, a former Serbian basketball player and coach, took over as head coach of AEL Limassol B.C. in 2002.

The rebellion was a violent confrontation between the gold miners and the colonial authorities, which resulted in the deaths of six miners and the overthrow of the government's authority in the goldfields.\n\n##Introduction\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion was a culmination of months of protests and tensions between the gold miners and the colonial authorities. The gold miners, who were primarily immigrants from Europe, were dissatisfied with the conditions on the goldfields, including the lack of representation in government, the exorbitant cost of living, and the oppressive treatment by the authorities. The rebellion was a turning point in Australian history, marking the beginning of a new era of democracy and self-governance.\n\n##Origins in the Victorian Gold Rush\n\n###Protests on the Goldfields: 1851–1854\n\nThe Victorian gold rush began in 1851, when Edward Hargraves discovered gold in Bathurst, New South Wales. The news of the discovery sparked a rush of prospectors to the goldfields, including to the Ballarat and Bendigo regions. As the number of miners increased, so did the tensions between the miners and the authorities. The miners were dissatisfied with the lack of representation in government, the high cost of living, and the oppressive treatment by the authorities.\n\n###La Trobe Introduces Monthly Mining Tax as Protests Begin\n\nIn 1852, Governor Charles La Trobe introduced a monthly mining tax, which further enraged the miners. The tax was seen as a direct attack on the miners' livelihood, and it sparked widespread protests across the goldfields. The miners demanded that the tax be repealed, but La Trobe refused to back down.\n\n###First Gold Commissioner Arrives in Ballarat\n\nIn 1853, the first gold commissioner, Captain Hesse, arrived in Ballarat to oversee the goldfields. Hesse was seen as a representative of the colonial authorities, and his presence further exacerbated the tensions between the miners and the authorities.\n\n###Bendigo Petition and the Red Ribbon Movement\n\nIn 1853, a petition was circulated in Bendigo, calling for the government to address the grievances of the miners. The petition was signed by over 10,000 miners, and it marked a significant turning point in the protests. The Red Ribbon Movement, a movement of miners who wore red ribbons on their hats to show their support for the petition, also gained momentum.\n\n###Legislative Council Calls for Commission of Inquiry\n\nIn 1854, the Legislative Council called for a Commission of Inquiry into the conditions on the goldfields. The commission was tasked with investigating the grievances of the miners and making recommendations for reform. However, the commission was seen as a delaying tactic by the authorities, and it only served to further enrage the miners.\n\n###Hotham Replaces La Trobe\n\nIn 1854, Governor Sir Charles Hotham replaced La Trobe as governor. Hotham was seen as a hardliner, and his appointment only served to further escalate the tensions between the miners and the authorities.\n\n##Tensions Escalate\n\n###Murder of James Scobie and the Burning of the Eureka Hotel\n\nIn November 1854, a miner named James Scobie was murdered in the Eureka Hotel. The murder was seen as a direct attack on the miners, and it sparked widespread outrage. The Eureka Hotel was subsequently burned to the ground, marking a significant escalation of the tensions between the miners and the authorities.\n\n###Ballarat Reform League Meetings\n\nIn 1854, the Ballarat Reform League was formed, with the aim of addressing the grievances of the miners. The league was led by Peter Lalor, a Irish-born miner who had been instrumental in organizing the protests. The league held a series of meetings, which were attended by thousands of miners, and it called for reform and self-governance.\n\n###Escalating Violence as Military Convoy Looted\n\nIn December 1854, a military convoy was looted by a group of miners. The looting was seen as a direct attack on the authorities, and it sparked widespread violence. The authorities responded by deploying troops to the goldfields, but the miners were well-prepared and ready for a fight.\n\n##Open Rebellion\n\n###Paramilitary Mobilisation and Swearing Allegiance to the Southern Cross\n\nIn December 1854, the miners mobilized a paramilitary force, which was led by Peter Lalor. The force swore allegiance to the Southern Cross flag, which had become a symbol of the miners' struggle for self-governance. The paramilitary force was well-armed and well-prepared, and it was determined to fight for the miners' rights.\n\n###Fortification of the Eureka Lead\n\nThe paramilitary force fortified the Eureka Lead, a site of significant historical importance, and prepared for battle. The Eureka Lead was a site of great symbolic value, and the miners were determined to defend it at all costs.\n\n####Vinegar Hill Blunder: Irish Dimension Factors in Dwindling Numbers at Stockade\n\nThe paramilitary force was led by Peter Lalor, an Irish-born miner, who had significant influence over the miners. However, Lalor's leadership style and his Irish background may have contributed to the dwindling numbers at the stockade. The Vinegar Hill blunder, a reference to the Irish Rebellion of 1798, suggests that Lalor's leadership may have been influenced by his Irish heritage.\n\n####Departing Detachment of Independent Californian Rangers Leaves Small Garrison Behind\n\nIn the days leading up to the battle, a detachment of Independent Californian Rangers departed the goldfields, leaving a small garrison behind. The departure of the Rangers may have contributed to the miners' confidence and determination to fight.\n\n##Battle of the Eureka Stockade\n\nOn December 3, 1854, the Battle of the Eureka Stockade took place. The battle was a violent confrontation between the paramilitary force and the authorities, which resulted in the deaths of six miners and the overthrow of the government's authority in the goldfields. The battle marked a significant turning point in Australian history, marking the beginning of a new era of democracy and self-governance.\n\n##Aftermath\n\n###Trials for Sedition and High Treason\n\nIn the aftermath of the battle, trials were held for sedition and high treason. Peter Lalor and other leaders of the paramilitary force were charged with treason, but they were acquitted. The trials marked a significant shift in the balance of power between the miners and the authorities.\n\n###Commission of Inquiry Report\n\nIn 1855, a Commission of Inquiry was established to investigate the events leading up to the battle. The commission's report was highly critical of the authorities, and it recommended significant reforms to address the grievances of the miners.\n\n###Peter Lalor Enters Parliament\n\nIn 1856, Peter Lalor entered parliament, where he became a vocal advocate for the rights of the miners. Lalor's entry into parliament marked a significant step towards self-governance and democracy in Australia.\n\n##Location of Bakery Hill and the Eureka Stockade\n\nThe Eureka Stockade was located on the Eureka Lead, a site of significant historical importance. The site is now a museum and a popular tourist destination. Bakery Hill, a nearby site, is also of great historical significance and is now a museum.\n\n##Political Legacy\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion had a significant impact on Australian politics. The rebellion marked a turning point in the country's history, marking the beginning of a new era of democracy and self-governance. The rebellion also led to significant reforms, including the establishment of a new constitution and the expansion of the franchise.\n\n##Commemoration\n\n###19th Century\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion was commemorated in the 19th century, with the establishment of a memorial on the site of the stockade. The memorial was dedicated in 1859, and it marked a significant milestone in the country's history.\n\n###20th Century\n\nIn the 20th century, the Eureka Rebellion was commemorated with a series of events and exhibits. The rebellion was seen as a key moment in Australian history, and it was celebrated as a symbol of democracy and self-governance.\n\n###21st Century\n\nIn the 21st century, the Eureka Rebellion continues to be commemorated, with a range of events and exhibits celebrating the country's history. The rebellion is seen as a key moment in Australian history, marking the beginning of a new era of democracy and self-governance.\n\n##Popular Culture\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion has been immortalized in popular culture, with a range of books, films, and songs celebrating the country's history. The rebellion is seen as a symbol of Australian identity, and it continues to be celebrated as a key moment in the country's history.\n\n##See Also\n\n* Australian history\n* Gold rush\n* Democracy and self-governance\n* Peter Lalor\n* Eureka Lead\n* Bakery Hill\n\n##Notes\n\n* The Eureka Rebellion was a significant turning point in Australian history, marking the beginning of a new era of democracy and self-governance.\n* The rebellion was led by Peter Lalor, an Irish-born miner, who had significant influence over the miners.\n* The rebellion was fought against the authorities, who were seen as oppressive and corrupt.\n* The rebellion marked a significant shift in the balance of power between the miners and the authorities.\n* The rebellion led to significant reforms, including the establishment of a new constitution and the expansion of the franchise.\n\n##References\n\n* None\n\n##Bibliography\n\n* \"The Eureka Stockade\" by Peter Lalor\n* \"The Eureka Rebellion\" by R.

The year saw the continued rise of streaming services and the growth of the global film industry. This article provides an overview of the year's notable events, highest-grossing films, award ceremonies, film festivals, and notable releases.\n\n**Evaluation of the Year**\n\n2023 was a significant year for the film industry, with a number of notable trends and developments. The year saw a continued shift towards streaming services, with many major studios releasing their films directly to these platforms. This trend was driven in part by the COVID-19 pandemic, which had accelerated the growth of streaming services as people turned to them for entertainment during lockdown.\n\nThe year also saw a number of notable box office successes, with films such as \"Oppenheimer\" and \"Barbie\" dominating the charts. However, the year was also marked by a number of high-profile flops, including the costly misfire \"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\".\n\nDespite these trends, 2023 was also a year of innovation and experimentation in the film industry.

Her high-profile case drew widespread media attention and sparked conversations about social class, privilege, and the psychological tactics used by con artists.\n\nEarly life\n\nAnna Sorokin was born on January 23, 1991, in Domodedovo, Moscow, Russia, to a working-class family. Her parents were both factory workers, and the family lived in a small apartment. Sorokin has stated that she experienced a difficult childhood, marked by poverty and neglect. Her family moved to Germany when she was 9 years old, where her father struggled to find employment.\n\nSorokin's parents encouraged her to pursue higher education, and she attended a vocational school in Germany. However, she dropped out of school at the age of 18 to pursue a career in fashion. Sorokin began working as a waitress and later as a sales associate in a clothing store. She became interested in social media and began to build a online presence, creating a persona that showcased her affluent lifestyle.\n\nFraud\n\nSorokin's scheme began in 2017, when she created a fake online profile that presented her as a wealthy heiress from Russia. She claimed to be the daughter of a wealthy oil magnate and created a series of fake bank statements, credit card statements, and receipts to support her claims. Sorokin used these fake documents to scam numerous individuals, businesses, and hotels, convincing them to provide her with financial assistance, luxury goods, and accommodations.\n\nSorokin's scams ranged from convincing a friend to invest in a fake startup to renting a luxury apartment in Manhattan and claiming that she was unable to pay the rent. She also claimed to be suffering from a rare medical condition and convinced a doctor to write her a prescription for a costly medication. Sorokin's scheme was estimated to have cost her victims over $275,000.\n\nIndictment and arrest\n\nSorokin was arrested in October 2018, after a hotel in Manhattan reported that she had failed to pay for a stay. She was charged with multiple counts of grand larceny, theft of services, and attempted grand larceny. Sorokin was held in jail on a $22,000 bond, which was posted by a friend.\n\nTrial, conviction, and sentence\n\nSorokin's trial began in February 2019 and lasted for several weeks. She was represented by a team of lawyers, who argued that she was a victim of circumstance and that her actions were those of a young woman who had been taken advantage of by her wealthy acquaintances. Sorokin's defense team also argued that she had been suffering from a series of mental health issues, including depression and anxiety.\n\nHowever, the prosecution presented evidence that showed Sorokin's scheme was premeditated and that she had intentionally deceived her victims. The prosecution also presented expert testimony from a psychologist who stated that Sorokin's behavior was consistent with that of a con artist.\n\nOn April 9, 2019, Sorokin was found guilty on multiple counts of grand larceny, theft of services, and attempted grand larceny. She was sentenced to 4 to 12 years in prison and ordered to pay restitution to her victims.\n\nICE custody\n\nIn August 2020, Sorokin was transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody, where she was held for approximately 12 days. During her time in ICE custody, Sorokin's lawyers argued that she was a German citizen and that she had not been properly informed of the charges against her. Sorokin was eventually released from ICE custody and returned to a women's prison in New York.\n\nMedia representation\n\nSorokin's case drew widespread media attention, with numerous news outlets and publications covering her arrest, trial, and sentencing. Her case sparked conversations about social class, privilege, and the psychological tactics used by con artists.\n\nSorokin's case was also the subject of several documentaries and podcasts, including a Netflix documentary series that explored her life and actions. Sorokin's story was also featured in several books, including a memoir written by a journalist who had interviewed her while she was in prison.\n\nAfter prison\n\nAfter her release from prison, Sorokin began to rebuild her life. She started working as a writer and artist, and has since published several articles and essays on topics such as social class and privilege.\n\nArt shows\n\nIn 2022, Sorokin held her first art show, titled \"The Fake Heiress,\" which featured a series of paintings and installations that explored her experiences as a con artist. The show was held at a gallery in Los Angeles and was attended by several art critics and journalists.\n\nNon-fungible tokens\n\nIn 2022, Sorokin began creating non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are digital artworks that are stored on a blockchain and can be bought and sold. Sorokin's NFTs feature a series of images and videos that explore her life and experiences as a con artist.\n\nFashion\n\nSorokin has also started working in the fashion industry, creating a clothing line that features a series of high-end garments and accessories. Sorokin's fashion line is inspired by her experiences as a con artist and features a series of bold and provocative designs.\n\nPersonal life\n\nSorokin is currently single and resides in New York City. She has stated that she is working to rebuild her life and to become a more honest and authentic person. Sorokin has also stated that she is working to use her experiences to help others, including those who have been victims of scams and cons.\n\nSee also\n\n* Con artist\n* Social class\n* Privilege\n* Non-fungible token\n* Fashion\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n* Anna Sorokin's official website\n* Anna Sorokin's Instagram account\n* Anna Sorokin's Twitter account\n* Anna Sorokin's LinkedIn profile", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Anna_Sorokin\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Fraud\n#Indictment and arrest\n#Trial, conviction, and sentence\n#ICE custody\n#Media representation\n#After prison\n##Art shows\n##Non-fungible tokens\n##Fashion\n#Personal life\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This can occur due to various reasons, including respiratory or cardiac problems, anemia, or exposure to high altitudes. Hypoxia can have a significant impact on the body's organs and systems, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and confusion.\n\n**Classification**\n\nHypoxia can be classified in several ways, including by cause, extent, and affected tissues and organs.\n\n### By Cause\n\nHypoxia can be caused by various factors, including:\n\n* **Ischemia**: Reduced blood flow to a specific area of the body, leading to inadequate oxygen delivery.\n* **Hypoxemic hypoxia**: Low levels of oxygen in the blood, often caused by respiratory or cardiac problems.\n* **Anemia**: Insufficient red blood cells or hemoglobin, leading to reduced oxygen-carrying capacity.\n* **Histotoxic hypoxia**: Inhibition of oxygen utilization by tissues, often caused by certain toxins or chemicals.\n\n### By Extent\n\nHypoxia can be classified as:\n\n* **Generalized hypoxia**: Widespread reduction in oxygen supply to the body's tissues.\n* **Localized hypoxia**: Reduced oxygen supply to a specific area or organ.\n* **Mild hypoxia**: Slightly reduced oxygen supply, often causing minimal symptoms.\n* **Severe hypoxia**: Significant reduction in oxygen supply, leading to severe symptoms and potentially life-threatening complications.\n\n### By Affected Tissues and Organs\n\nHypoxia can affect various tissues and organs, including:\n\n#### Cerebral hypoxia\n\n* Reduced oxygen supply to the brain, leading to symptoms such as confusion, disorientation, and loss of consciousness.\n* Can cause permanent damage to brain tissue if not promptly treated.\n\n#### Corneal hypoxia\n\n* Reduced oxygen supply to the cornea, leading to symptoms such as blurred vision, dryness, and corneal ulcers.\n* Can cause permanent damage to the cornea if not promptly treated.\n\n#### Intrauterine hypoxia\n\n* Reduced oxygen supply to the fetus during pregnancy, leading to symptoms such as fetal distress and potential birth defects.\n* Can cause long-term developmental and cognitive problems if not promptly treated.\n\n#### Tumor hypoxia\n\n* Reduced oxygen supply to tumor cells, leading to reduced effectiveness of cancer treatment.\n* Can cause tumor cells to become more aggressive and resistant to treatment.\n\n#### Vestibular system\n\n* Reduced oxygen supply to the vestibular system, leading to symptoms such as dizziness, vertigo, and balance problems.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nHypoxia can cause a range of symptoms, including:\n\n* Fatigue\n* Shortness of breath\n* Confusion\n* Disorientation\n* Dizziness\n* Vertigo\n* Balance problems\n* Headaches\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Rapid heart rate\n\n### Complications\n\nSevere or prolonged hypoxia can lead to complications, including:\n\n* Organ failure\n* Respiratory failure\n* Cardiac arrest\n* Stroke\n* Seizures\n* Coma\n* Death\n\n**Causes**\n\nHypoxia can be caused by various factors, including:\n\n### Ischemia\n\n* Reduced blood flow to a specific area of the body, leading to inadequate oxygen delivery.\n* Can be caused by a range of factors, including atherosclerosis, blood clots, and cardiac problems.\n\n### Hypoxemic hypoxia\n\n* Low levels of oxygen in the blood, often caused by respiratory or cardiac problems.\n* Can be caused by a range of factors, including pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and heart failure.\n\n### Carbon monoxide poisoning\n\n* Inhaling carbon monoxide gas, which binds to hemoglobin and reduces oxygen-carrying capacity.\n* Can be caused by a range of factors, including faulty gas appliances, vehicle exhaust, and industrial accidents.\n\n### Altitude\n\n* Reduced oxygen levels at high altitudes, leading to hypoxia.\n* Can cause symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and headaches.\n\n### Hypoxic breathing gases\n\n* Breathing gases with low oxygen levels, often caused by medical equipment or altitude exposure.\n* Can cause hypoxia and potentially life-threatening complications.\n\n### Other\n\n* Anemia\n* Histotoxic hypoxia\n* Other medical conditions that affect oxygen supply or utilization.\n\n**Mechanism**\n\nHypoxia occurs when there is an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand, leading to reduced oxygen availability for tissues and organs.\n\n### Physiological responses\n\nThe body responds to hypoxia by increasing respiration and circulation to try to meet oxygen demands.\n\n### Acute\n\nAcute hypoxia occurs when there is a sudden reduction in oxygen supply, often caused by a medical emergency or accident.\n\n### Chronic\n\nChronic hypoxia occurs when there is a prolonged reduction in oxygen supply, often caused by a medical condition or environmental exposure.\n\n### Pathological responses\n\nHypoxia can cause pathological responses, including:\n\n* Cerebral ischemia: Reduced oxygen supply to the brain, leading to symptoms such as confusion, disorientation, and loss of consciousness.\n* Myocardial ischemia: Reduced oxygen supply to the heart, leading to symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and potential heart attack.\n* Tumor angiogenesis: Formation of new blood vessels to supply oxygen to tumor cells, leading to tumor growth and potential metastasis.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosis of hypoxia typically involves a combination of physical examination, history, and tests, including:\n\n### Physical examination and history\n\n* Medical history and review of symptoms\n* Physical examination, including vital signs and neurological examination\n* Review of laboratory results, including blood tests and imaging studies\n\n### Tests\n\n* Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis to measure oxygen levels in the blood\n* Pulse oximetry to measure oxygen saturation\n* Echocardiogram to evaluate heart function\n* MRI or CT scan to evaluate brain or other organ function\n* Other tests, such as pulmonary function tests or cardiac stress tests, may be ordered depending on the suspected cause of hypoxia.\n\n### Differential diagnosis\n\nHypoxia can be diagnosed by ruling out other medical conditions that may cause similar symptoms, including:\n\n* Respiratory problems, such as pneumonia or COPD\n* Cardiac problems, such as heart failure or cardiac arrhythmias\n* Anemia or other blood disorders\n* Altitude exposure or other environmental factors\n* Other medical conditions, such as neurological disorders or metabolic disorders\n\n**Prevention**\n\nPrevention of hypoxia depends on the cause, but general strategies include:\n\n### Prevention of altitude induced hypoxia\n\n* Acclimatization to high altitudes by gradually increasing exposure to higher elevations\n* Use of supplemental oxygen or specialized equipment, such as oxygen tanks or altitude masks\n* Avoidance of high-altitude activities, such as mountain climbing or flying, if not properly acclimatized.\n\n**Treatment and management**\n\nTreatment of hypoxia typically involves addressing the underlying cause, as well as providing oxygen therapy and supportive care.\n\n### Treatment of acute and chronic cases\n\n* Acute hypoxia: Oxygen therapy, ventilation support, and cardiac or respiratory stabilization may be necessary.\n* Chronic hypoxia: Treatment of underlying medical conditions, such as anemia or cardiac problems, may be necessary, as well as long-term oxygen therapy or other supportive care.\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nOutcomes for hypoxia depend on the severity and duration of the condition, as well as the effectiveness of treatment. In some cases, hypoxia can be fatal if not promptly treated. In other cases, long-term damage to organs or tissues may occur, leading to chronic health problems.\n\n**Epidemiology**\n\nHypoxia is a significant public health problem, with an estimated 1 in 5 people experiencing hypoxia at some point in their lives. Silent hypoxia, or undiagnosed hypoxia, is a particular concern, as it can lead to long-term health problems without proper diagnosis or treatment.\n\n**History**\n\nThe term \"hypoxia\" was first coined in the 17th century to describe a condition of insufficient oxygen supply. Since then, the understanding of hypoxia has evolved significantly, with advances in medical technology and our understanding of the mechanisms underlying this condition.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe word \"hypoxia\" comes from the Greek words \"hypo,\" meaning \"under\" or \"below,\" and \"oxia,\" meaning \"oxygen.\"", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hypoxia_(medicine)\" following this outline:\n\n#Classification\n##By cause\n##By extent\n###Generalized hypoxia\n###Localized hypoxia\n###By affected tissues and organs\n####Cerebral hypoxia\n####Corneal hypoxia\n####Intrauterine hypoxia\n####Tumor hypoxia\n####Vestibular system\n#Signs and symptoms\n##Complications\n#Causes\n##Ischemia\n##Hypoxemic hypoxia\n###Carbon monoxide poisoning\n###Altitude\n###Hypoxic breathing gases\n###Other\n##Anemia\n##Histotoxic hypoxia\n#Mechanism\n##Physiological responses\n##Acute\n##Chronic\n##Pathological responses\n###Cerebral ischemia\n###Myocardial ischemia\n###Tumor angiogenesis\n#Diagnosis\n##Physical examination and history\n##Tests\n##Differential diagnosis\n#Prevention\n##Prevention of altitude induced hypoxia\n#Treatment and management\n##Treatment of acute and chronic cases\n#Outcomes\n#Epidemiology\n##Silent hypoxia\n#History\n##Etymology\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film features a talented ensemble cast, including Tom Hanks, Benjamin Evan Ainsworth, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Pinocchio was released in theaters on September 23, 2022, and has since become a commercial success.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film tells the story of Geppetto, a poor but kind-hearted woodcarver who creates a puppet named Pinocchio. Geppetto's wish to bring Pinocchio to life is granted by a mysterious and magical blue fairy, but with a caveat: Pinocchio must prove himself to be brave, truthful, and unselfish in order to become a real boy. Pinocchio's journey takes him through various adventures, including encounters with a cricket named Jiminy, a fox named Honest John, and a cat named Stromboli. Along the way, Pinocchio learns valuable lessons about loyalty, honesty, and responsibility.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Tom Hanks as Geppetto\n* Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Pinocchio\n* Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Jiminy Cricket\n* Keegan-Michael Key as Lampwick\n* Lorraine Bracco as Mother Fox\n* Luke Evans as Coachman\n* Jackie Weaver as Blue Fairy\n* Giacomo Gianniotti as Father Carlo\n* Chris Noth as The Coachman's Assistant\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe idea for a live-action Pinocchio film was first conceived in the early 1990s, with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Tom Schulman attached to the project. However, the film was repeatedly delayed and underwent numerous rewrites before finally going into production in 2020. Zemeckis has stated that he wanted to create a film that would be faithful to the original story while also introducing new elements and themes.\n\n### Casting\n\nBenjamin Evan Ainsworth was cast as Pinocchio in 2019, after a lengthy audition process. Ainsworth had previously appeared in a number of stage productions, including a production of Pinocchio at the Royal Shakespeare Company. Tom Hanks was cast as Geppetto in 2020, with Zemeckis stating that he was the only actor he wanted for the role.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for Pinocchio began in September 2020 and wrapped in April 2021. The film was shot on location in Italy and in studios in the United Kingdom. Zemeckis has stated that he used a combination of practical and CGI effects to bring the world of Pinocchio to life.\n\n### Visual effects and animation\n\nThe visual effects for Pinocchio were created by Industrial Light & Magic, with a team of over 100 artists and technicians working on the project. The film's visual style was designed to be reminiscent of classic fairy tales, with a mix of practical and CGI effects used to create the characters and sets.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe music for Pinocchio was composed by Alan Silvestri, who has previously worked with Zemeckis on a number of films, including Back to the Future and Forrest Gump. The soundtrack features a mix of orchestral and choral music, with a number of original songs written for the film.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nPinocchio was marketed as a family-friendly film, with a focus on its themes of loyalty, honesty, and responsibility. The film's trailer was released in June 2022, with a number of promotional tie-ins and partnerships established with toy companies and other brands.\n\n**Release**\n\nPinocchio was released in theaters on September 23, 2022, in the United States and on September 30, 2022, in the United Kingdom. The film was released in a number of formats, including 3D, IMAX, and Dolby Cinema.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Audience viewership\n\nPinocchio was a commercial success, grossing over $440 million at the global box office.

The exercises were seen as a demonstration of China's military prowess and a test of its ability to project power in the region. This article will provide an overview of the background, military exercises, reactions, and aftermath of the 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Incursions into Taiwan ADIZ\n\nIn 2022, China's military incursions into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) increased significantly. Taiwan's ADIZ is a buffer zone that extends 12 nautical miles from Taiwan's coastline and is used to detect and respond to potential threats. China's incursions into Taiwan's ADIZ involved fighter jets, bombers, and other military aircraft. These incursions were seen as a deliberate attempt by China to challenge Taiwan's sovereignty and test its military defenses.\n\n### Escalation of Tensions\n\nThe increase in China's military incursions into Taiwan's ADIZ was accompanied by an escalation of tensions between China and Taiwan. China has long considered Taiwan to be a part of its territory and has threatened to use military force to bring the island under its control. Taiwan, on the other hand, has maintained its independence and has been recognized by many countries as a sovereign state. The escalation of tensions between China and Taiwan has been fueled by China's growing military capabilities and its increasing assertiveness in the region.\n\n**Military Exercises**\n\nIn response to China's incursions into Taiwan's ADIZ, Taiwan's military conducted a series of exercises to demonstrate its military capabilities and show its determination to defend its sovereignty. The exercises involved fighter jets, bombers, and other military aircraft, as well as naval and ground forces. The exercises were seen as a show of force by Taiwan's military and a demonstration of its ability to defend the island against potential threats.\n\nChina, in turn, conducted a series of military exercises to demonstrate its military capabilities and show its determination to bring Taiwan under its control. The exercises involved fighter jets, bombers, and other military aircraft, as well as naval and ground forces.

This demographic group is often described as being between the ages of 22 and 30, although the exact age range may vary depending on the source.\n\n**#Etymology**\n\nThe term \"Zillennials\" is a portmanteau of \"Zoomer\" (a colloquial term for Generation Z) and \"Millennial.\" It was first coined by media outlets and social commentators to describe individuals who were born during the same time period as Millennials but grew up in a world with different technological, social, and economic conditions. The term is not universally accepted, and some individuals may identify with other generations or demographic labels.\n\n**#Birth date and age range**\n\nAs the term \"Zillennials\" is still evolving, there is no clear consensus on the birth date and age range that defines this demographic group. However, based on available data and trends, it is generally agreed that Zillennials were born between 1990 and 2002, with the majority falling within the 1995-1997 range. This age range would place Zillennials in their early twenties to late twenties as of 2023.\n\n**#Characteristics**\n\nZillennials are often described as being shaped by the unique social, cultural, and economic conditions of their time. Here are some key characteristics that are commonly associated with this demographic group:\n\n##**Arts and culture**\n\nZillennials grew up in a world where digital technology and social media dominated popular culture. They were exposed to a wide range of artistic and cultural influences, including reality TV, YouTube, and streaming services. As a result, Zillennials are known for their eclectic tastes and diverse interests, which often blend traditional and modern elements. They are also highly attuned to social justice and activism, with many identifying as LGBTQ+, people of color, or individuals with disabilities.\n\n##**Economic activity**\n\nZillennials entered the workforce during a time of economic uncertainty, characterized by the Great Recession and rising income inequality. As a result, they are often described as being cautious and pragmatic in their economic decision-making, prioritizing financial stability and security over other goals. However, they are also known for their entrepreneurial spirit and willingness to take risks, with many starting their own businesses or pursuing freelance careers.\n\n##**Health**\n\nZillennials are growing up in a world where health and wellness are increasingly important. They are more likely to prioritize self-care and mental health, with many seeking out therapy, meditation, and other holistic practices. They are also highly aware of the importance of physical activity and nutrition, with many following plant-based diets and engaging in regular exercise.\n\n##**Personal values**\n\nZillennials are known for their commitment to social justice and activism, with many identifying as allies to marginalized communities. They value diversity, inclusivity, and equality, and are often involved in volunteer work, community organizing, and advocacy efforts. They are also highly attuned to environmental issues, with many prioritizing sustainability and reducing their carbon footprint.\n\n##**Political activity**\n\nZillennials are growing up in a world where politics is increasingly polarized and divisive. As a result, they are often described as being apathetic or disillusioned with traditional politics. However, they are also highly engaged in social media and online activism, with many using digital platforms to mobilize support and raise awareness about social and environmental issues.\n\n##**Social life**\n\nZillennials are known for their love of social media and online communities. They are highly connected and engaged, with many spending hours each day scrolling through social media, texting friends, and participating in online forums. They are also highly attuned to social norms and trends, with many prioritizing authenticity and transparency in their online interactions.\n\n##**Technology**\n\nZillennials grew up in a world dominated by technology, with smartphones, social media, and streaming services becoming an integral part of their daily lives. They are highly skilled and confident in their use of digital tools, often using technology to learn new skills, access information, and connect with others.\n\n**#See also**\n\n* Millennials\n* Generation Z\n* Generation Alpha\n* Social media\n* Digital culture\n* Entrepreneurship\n* Sustainability\n* Social justice\n* Mental health\n\n**#References**\n\n(Note: This section is typically used to provide a list of sources used in the article.

The row led to a series of protests, court cases, and violence, highlighting the complexities of religious freedom and identity in India.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe controversy began in Udupi, a city in the coastal region of Karnataka, where a group of Muslim students at the Government Pre-University College (GPC) wore hijabs to school. This was not a new phenomenon, as Muslim students had been wearing hijabs to school for years without any issues. However, in 2022, the controversy surrounding the hijab took a different turn.\n\n**Events**\n\n### Udupi Dispute\n\nOn February 4, 2022, the college administration, under pressure from right-wing Hindu groups, told the Muslim students to remove their hijabs. The students refused, citing their right to wear the hijab as part of their religious freedom. The college administration, backed by the state government, argued that the hijab was not part of the college's dress code.\n\n### Saffron Protests\n\nIn response to the college's decision, Hindu student groups and right-wing organizations, led by the Sri Ram Sena, began protesting outside the college, waving saffron flags and chanting slogans against the hijab. The protests turned violent, with reports of stone-throwing and clashes between the protesters and the police.\n\n### Government Reaction\n\nThe Karnataka government, led by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, initially supported the college's decision, stating that the hijab was not part of the dress code. However, as the controversy escalated, the government tried to mediate, setting up a committee to resolve the issue.\n\n### Fallout\n\nThe controversy spread to other parts of the state, with protests and counter-protests erupting in several cities. The hashtag #HijabRow began trending on social media, with many Indians expressing their opinions on the issue. The controversy also drew international attention, with human rights organizations and diplomats weighing in on the issue.\n\n**Petitions in the High Court**\n\n### Religious Rights\n\nOn February 10, 2022, a group of Muslim students filed a petition in the Karnataka High Court, challenging the college's decision to ban the hijab. The petitioners argued that the hijab was an essential part of their religious identity and that the college's decision was a violation of their right to freedom of religion.\n\n### Government Order\n\nThe Karnataka government, in an attempt to resolve the issue, issued an order stating that students could wear hijabs, but only outside the college campus. This order was widely criticized by Muslim organizations, who argued that it was an attempt to restrict their freedom of religion.\n\n### College Development Committees\n\nIn an effort to resolve the issue, the college administration set up a committee to develop a new dress code for students. However, the committee's recommendations were widely criticized by Muslim students and organizations, who argued that they were not consulted and that the recommendations were biased against the hijab.\n\n### Udupi College and Other Institutions\n\nThe controversy surrounding the hijab spread to other institutions in Karnataka, with several colleges and universities imposing dress codes that banned the hijab. Muslim students and organizations filed petitions in the High Court, challenging these dress codes and arguing that they were a violation of their right to freedom of religion.\n\n**High Court Verdict**\n\nOn March 15, 2022, the Karnataka High Court delivered a verdict in the case, ruling that the hijab was an essential part of Muslim women's dress and that the college's decision to ban it was unconstitutional. The court also ruled that the government's order allowing students to wear hijabs outside the college campus was unconstitutional.\n\n**Supreme Court**\n\nThe Karnataka government filed a Special Leave Petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court, challenging the High Court's verdict. On May 13, 2022, the Supreme Court stayed the High Court's verdict, allowing the college to continue its ban on the hijab.\n\n**Violence**\n\nThe controversy surrounding the hijab led to several incidents of violence, including clashes between protesters and the police, and attacks on Muslim students and organizations. On March 18, 2022, a group of Hindu extremists attacked a group of Muslim students in Udupi, injuring several people.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Domestic\n\nThe controversy surrounding the hijab drew reactions from various sections of Indian society. Many Indians, including Muslims, supported the High Court's verdict, arguing that it was a victory for freedom of religion. Others, including Hindu nationalists, opposed the verdict, arguing that it was a threat to national security.\n\n### International\n\nThe controversy surrounding the hijab drew international attention, with human rights organizations and diplomats weighing in on the issue. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, expressed concern over the situation, stating that it was a test of India's commitment to freedom of religion.\n\n### Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)\n\nThe Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) issued a statement on February 18, 2022, stating that the Indian government was committed to protecting the rights of all citizens, including those who wore the hijab.
