They were the daughters of John Herbert Bowes-Lyon and Fenella Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes-Trefusis, and were born into a family with strong aristocratic connections. Despite their family ties, the sisters were largely forgotten and their existence was unknown to many until a 2011 documentary and subsequent media coverage brought their story to light.\n\n**Background**\n\nNerissa Bowes-Lyon was born on 18 February 1919 and Katherine Bowes-Lyon was born on 4 July 1926. Their father, John Herbert Bowes-Lyon, was the second son of Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, a brother of Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the future Queen Elizabeth II's mother. Their mother, Fenella Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes-Trefusis, was the younger daughter of Charles Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes-Trefusis, 21st Baron Clinton.\n\nThe Bowes-Lyon family was a prominent aristocratic family with a long history of military service and public service. They were known for their charitable work and their involvement in various philanthropic endeavors. However, despite their family's connections and reputation, Nerissa and Katherine were not given the same opportunities as their cousins, Elizabeth and Anne, who were known to have had privileged lives and close relationships with their family members.\n\n**Controversy**\n\nSuggestions of a cover-up surrounding the sisters' existence were rejected in the press by Lord Clinton in 1987. He claimed that his aunt Fenella, the mother of the two women, had completed the form for Burke's incorrectly due to being \"a vague person.\" However, Burke's included specific dates of death for both sisters. According to a 2011 television documentary about the sisters, The Queen's Hidden Cousins, broadcast by Channel 4, \"throughout their time at the hospital, there is no known record that the sisters were ever visited by any member of the Bowes-Lyon or royal families, despite their aunt, the Queen Mother, being a Patron of Mencap.\"\n\nNurses interviewed on the documentary said that, to their knowledge, the family never sent the sisters a birthday or Christmas gift or card. When Nerissa died in 1986, none of her family attended the funeral. She was buried at the nearby Redstone Cemetery, Earlswood, with her grave marked with plastic tags and a serial number until her existence was revealed in the media, after which the family added a gravestone.\n\n**Other family members**\n\nThree mentally disabled cousins of the girls also lived in Earlswood Hospital. Harriet Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes-Trefusis (1887-1958), sister of Nerissa and Katherine's mother Fenella, married Major Henry Nevile Fane, and three of their seven children lived in Earlswood Hospital. David Danks, then director of the Murdoch Children's Research Institute, thought that a genetic disease in the Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes-Trefusis family may have killed male members of the family in early childhood and caused learning disabilities in females.\n\nIn 1996, the surviving cousins were moved to Ketwin House care home in Surrey. When it closed in 2001, they were moved to another care home in Surrey.\n\n**The Queen's Hidden Cousins**\n\nIn November 2011, Channel 4 broadcast a documentary about the sisters, The Queen's Hidden Cousins. The documentary was directed by Kelly Close and made by Minnow Films, an independent production company. The synopsis states that \"Whilst their sisters Elizabeth and Anne enjoyed lives of privilege and inclusion in the upper echelons of the aristocracy, Katherine and Nerissa were all but forgotten, written out of family history.\" By telling the story of the individuals, and using the testimony of those who had lived alongside them in the asylum, the film hoped to contextualise \"the changing attitudes to learning disability in British society over the twentieth century.\"\n\n**In popular culture**\n\nThe sisters were depicted in the seventh episode of the fourth season of the Netflix drama series The Crown, \"The Hereditary Principle,\" which premiered in 2020. However, the way the events are reported is largely fictitious.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Earlswood Hospital\n* Mencap\n* The Crown (TV series)\n* The Queen's Hidden Cousins (TV documentary)\n* Royal family of the United Kingdom\n* Aristocracy of the United Kingdom\n* Learning disability\n* Mental health in the United Kingdom", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Nerissa_and_Katherine_Bowes-Lyon\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nNerissa Bowes-Lyon was born on 18 February 1919 and Katherine Bowes-Lyon was born on 4 July 1926, the daughters of John Herbert Bowes-Lyon and Fenella Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes-Trefusis Their father, the second son of Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, was a brother of Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the future Queen Elizabeth II's mother Their mother was the younger daughter of Charles Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes-Trefusis, 21st Baron Clinton.\n\n\nControversy\nSuggestions of a cover-up were rejected in the press by Lord Clinton in 1987, who claimed that his aunt Fenella (the mother of the two women) had completed the form for Burke's incorrectly due to Fenella being \"a vague person\"; however, Burke's included specific dates of death for both sisters [6] According to a 2011 television documentary about the sisters, The Queen's Hidden Cousins, broadcast by Channel 4, \"throughout their time at the hospital, there is no known record that the sisters were ever visited by any member of the Bowes-Lyon or royal families, despite their aunt, the Queen Mother, being a Patron of Mencap\" (a charity for people with learning disabilities) Nurses interviewed on the documentary said that, to their knowledge, the family never sent the sisters a birthday or Christmas gift or card When Nerissa died in 1986, none of her family attended the funeral She was buried at the nearby Redstone Cemetery, Earlswood [7] Her grave was marked with plastic tags and a serial number until her existence was revealed in the media, after which the family added a gravestone [1] [6] [8]\n\n\nOther family members\nThree mentally disabled cousins of the girls also lived in Earlswood Hospital Harriet Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes-Trefusis (1887–1958), sister of Nerissa and Katherine's mother Fenella, married Major Henry Nevile Fane, and three of their seven children lived in Earlswood Hospital David Danks, then director of the Murdoch Children's Research Institute, [11] thought that a genetic disease in the Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes-Trefusis family [12] may have killed male members of the family in early childhood and caused learning disabilities in females [13] In 1996, the surviving cousins were moved to Ketwin House care home in Surrey [14] When it closed in 2001, they were moved to another care home in Surrey [7]\n\n\nThe Queen's Hidden Cousins\nIn November 2011, Channel 4 broadcast a documentary about the sisters, The Queen's Hidden Cousins The documentary was directed by Kelly Close and made by Minnow Films, an independent production company, whose synopsis states that \"Whilst their sisters Elizabeth and Anne enjoyed lives of privilege and inclusion in the upper echelons of the aristocracy, Katherine and Nerissa were all but forgotten, written out of family history.\" By telling the story of the individuals, and using the testimony of those who had lived alongside them in the asylum, the film hoped to contextualise \"the changing attitudes to learning disability in British society over the twentieth century.\" [16]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nThe sisters were depicted in the seventh episode of the fourth season of the Netflix drama series The Crown, \"The Hereditary Principle\", which premiered in 2020 [5] However, the way the events are reported is largely fictitious [9]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "British_Post_Office_scandal", "content": "\nProsecutions\nBetween 1999 and 2015, the Post Office and the statutory authorities of the UK, including the CPS, the PPSNI, and the COPFS, brought forward hundreds of criminal prosecutions of subpostmasters [a] when the Horizon accounting system reported that money was missing from their post offices [1] In all, between 1999 and 2015, over 900 subpostmasters were prosecuted and 236 went to prison [2] The Post Office itself prosecuted 700 people [3]\n\n\nPost Office as private prosecutor\nAt the time of the prosecutions, the Post Office had the same standing in law as any other private prosecutor in the British legal system It acted as a private prosecutor in England and Wales In Scotland, it reported allegations of crime to a procurator fiscal, and in Northern Ireland to the Public Prosecution Service [10]\n\n\nPost Office civil cases against subpostmasters\nIn 2003, the Post Office pursued a civil claim against Julie Wolstenholme, subpostmaster at Cleveleys post office in Lancashire The Post Office dropped its claim and settled Wolstenholme's counterclaim out of court after a jointly appointed expert, Jason Coyne, reported that discrepancies could have been caused by faults in Horizon [14]\n\n\nPost Office management structure\nThe Post Office business, along with the Royal Mail delivery service, were formerly part of the General Post Office, tracing its origins back to 1516 It became a statutory corporation after the passage of the Post Office Act 1969 A gradual business restructuring process started in 1969 and was completed in 2012, after the Postal Services Act 2011 placed Royal Mail under separate ownership [23] Post Office Limited became and has remained a single share government-owned entity with government represented at board level.\n\n\nSubpostmasters' contracts\nSubpostmasters (SPMRs or SPMs) are self-employed and run branch post offices under contract to the Post Office [28] There were approximately 11,000 local branches.\nIn Bates vs Post Office, the subpostmasters argued that the Post Office owed a duty of good faith because a relational contract existed The Post Office relied entirely on the actual wording in the contracts, which stated: [29]\n\n\nManagement culture\nIn July 2023, Parliament debated the Post Office's management culture The then government representative, Tom Cooper, a senior civil servant, had been heavily criticised and had resigned following a scandal concerning Post Office bonuses and the slow disclosure of documents to the Horizon Inquiry \"That is not a great look for the Government and it raises real questions about the governance of Post Office Ltd.\" said Marion Fellows MP [31] Writing in The Guardian in July 2023, Marina Hyde said: [32] \"It remains something of a downer that the most widespread injustice in British legal history doesn't get the full-spectrum fever coverage that is lavished on more frivolous news – but then, the forces formerly known as The Man have always wanted this one covered up .. Wyn Williams's long-awaited and tirelessly fought-for inquiry is hearing evidence, except on the days it can't, because the Post Office is continually failing to hand over evidence.\"\n\n\nTax avoidance by Post Office management\nBBC business editor Simon Jack, on 12 January 2024, reported that the Post Office had underpaid more than £100m in tax by deducting payments to victims of the Horizon scandal from its profits Tax expert Dan Neidle maintained that claiming tax relief for compensation paid to victims of the scandal could be a breach of the law, it could also mean that the business is at risk of insolvency and that senior executives may have been overpaid Referring to notes in the most recent accounts, the BBC concludes that HM Revenue and Customs \"is investigating the way that the Post Office has accounted for the compensation payments and provisions\" [35] Heather Self, tax consultant, agreeing with Neidle's assessment said, \"The payments of compensation by the Post Office are almost certainly not deductible for corporation tax purposes, in my view.\" [35] Neidle maintains that the Post Office does not currently have enough money to pay a £100m tax bill and would be technically insolvent Although compensation payments seem to have been deducted from profits for tax purposes, they appear to have been ignored when calculating executive pay In year ending 2022 the CEO was paid a salary of £436,000 and a bonus of £137,000 [35] Neidle said: [35]\n\n\nNational Federation of Subpostmasters\n\nThroughout the scandal the National Federation of SubPostmasters (NFSP), which was wholly funded by the Post Office, insisted that Horizon was \"robust\" [36]: 34, 343  In February 2015, George Thomson, the General Secretary of the NFSP, told a House of Commons committee: [37]\n\nPost Office IT systems\nA 2020 article in Private Eye described the origins of Horizon: [40]\n\n\nProblems with the software\nThe Horizon IT system contained \"hundreds\" of bugs Those that came to light were named after the post offices where the bug first occurred These bugs included: the \"Dalmellington Bug,\" where the system would enter repeated withdrawals in the ledger every time the user pressed \"enter\" at a frozen interface screen; the \"Callendar Square Bug,\" where the system would create duplicate database entries in the ledger [41]\n\n\nInvestigating Post Office IT problems\nIn 2012 forensic accountants Second Sight were appointed by the Post Office to conduct an independent investigation of the Horizon software at the request of a group of MPs and the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance (JFSA) [56] Second Sight issued an interim report in July 2013 Their preliminary conclusions stated that, although \" [w]e have so far found no evidence of system wide (systemic) problems with the Horizon software\", the Post Office was aware of the existence of at least two defects or bugs in the software, one of which had occurred at least twice before being detected and fixed, which had led to false shortfalls in accounts at 76 branches The losses in two of these incidents had been identified by the Post Office and the subpostmasters had not been held liable, but one incident \"resulted in branches being asked to make good incorrect amounts.\" [48] [57] It also identified incidents when communication and hardware issues had caused account imbalances, noted the Post Office's failure to investigate reports of IT issues, and criticised the Post Office's focus on account recovery and prosecution over discovering how shortfalls had occurred [57] More than 100 subpostmasters were by this time saying that they had been prosecuted or forced to repay shortfalls created by Horizon [48]\n\n\nSecond Sight reports\nIn 2012 forensic accountants Second Sight were appointed by the Post Office to conduct an independent investigation of the Horizon software at the request of a group of MPs and the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance (JFSA) [56] Second Sight issued an interim report in July 2013 Their preliminary conclusions stated that, although \" [w]e have so far found no evidence of system wide (systemic) problems with the Horizon software\", the Post Office was aware of the existence of at least two defects or bugs in the software, one of which had occurred at least twice before being detected and fixed, which had led to false shortfalls in accounts at 76 branches The losses in two of these incidents had been identified by the Post Office and the subpostmasters had not been held liable, but one incident \"resulted in

investigate reports of IT issues, and criticised the Post Office's focus on account recovery and prosecution over discovering how shortfalls had occurred [57] More than 100 subpostmasters were by this time saying that they had been prosecuted or forced to repay shortfalls created by Horizon [48]\n\n\nMediation scheme\nAfter the publication of Second Sight's interim report, a mediation scheme for affected subpostmasters was set up in August 2013, to be funded by the Post Office and run by a working group comprising the Post Office, Second Sight and the JFSA and chaired by retired judge Sir Anthony Hooper [36]: 206  [28] Hooper doubted that the subpostmasters were dishonest and thought Horizon likely at fault [62] By December 2014, MPs were critical of the mediation scheme and 140 had withdrawn their support for it [63] James Arbuthnot, who was leading the 144 MPs who had been contacted by subpostmasters about the issue, accused the organisation of rejecting 90% of applications for mediation He said the Post Office had been \"duplicitous\", and suggested there would be legal and political campaigns in response [64]\n\n\nDetica report\nIn October 2013, Detica undertook a detailed analysis of the Post Office's systems It advised the Post Office that its systems were \"not fit for purpose in a modern retail and financial environment\" [70]\n\n\nClarke advice, CK Sift Review, Altman review\nFrom April 2012, the legal firm Cartwright King had a contract to handle Post Office prosecutions in England and Wales Simon Clarke, a barrister employed by Cartwright King, was assigned his first Post Office case in April or May 2013, and on 27 June he became aware that the forthcoming Second Sight report would describe two bugs in the Horizon Online software Clarke, wanting to know who had told Second Sight about the bugs, arranged a call the next day to Gareth Jenkins, a Fujitsu Services employee who had acted as an expert witness in several cases Jenkins said he had declared the two bugs to Second Sight, and was confident they did not compromise Horizon's audit trail, but went on to state \"you can never say there are no more bugs in the system\" Clarke quickly formed a view that Jenkins should not be used in future as an expert witness, and that use of Horizon data in past cases should be reviewed He made an ex parte public interest immunity application in the trial he was working on that was due to commence on 1 July [71] \"The basis of the application .. was the desire to prevent a widespread loss of confidence in a public institution or, a loss of trust in a system operated by such an institution or to prevent journalistic speculation about systems relied upon by the public.\" [72]\n\n\nDeloitte Review\nIn 2014 auditors from Deloitte found that branch accounts could be altered remotely by Fujitsu In February 2016 they began a further review, intending to look at Horizon transactions since its launch in 1999, but the Post Office halted their work four months later on legal advice after the subpostmasters had launched their group action [83]\n\n\nExposing the IT problems\nIn 2004, Bates approached Computer Weekly investigative journalist Tony Collins over suspicions about the Horizon IT system Five years elapsed before the journalists felt able to 'stand up' the story [84] Horizon was legally declared unreliable in Bates & Others v Post Office Ltd, in 2018 The unlawful nondisclosure of knowledge by the Post Office in its prosecution cases was established in law in the case of Hamilton & Others vs Post Office Ltd, in 2021.\n\n\nBates & Others v Post Office Ltd\nWhen mediation with the Post Office broke down, the subpostmasters began to consult and combine their efforts into legal action The action taken against the Post Office took the form first of group litigation in the name of Bates and others, a civil action in the High Court by some 555 people There were six lead claimants, and 23 common issues (that is issues common to all the cases) were identified and agreed to enable the court to examine the 555 cases The case was settled mid-trial by consent and without judgment as to costs; Post Office costs have been estimated as £100m [92] and those of the subpostmasters as £47m [93] The Post Office agreed to pay the subpostmasters £58 million, but after legal costs the claimants were left with £12 million to share [94] During the trial, which had been divided into a number of sub-trials, those acting for the Post Office attempted to persuade the judge to recuse himself Journalist and writer Nick Wallis, commenting on the two very senior lawyers who had advised the Post Office Board on the strategy, described it as \"misuse (of) a very serious instrument designed to aid fairness as a weapon purely for their wealthy client's benefit\" [95] At the Horizon inquiry, a former Post Office manager admitted that the ultimately lost case was seen by the Post Office as a way of \"killing off\" challenges to the Horizon system [96] Kathleen Donnelly, one of the barristers who acted for the subpostmasters in the case, said: [97] [98]\n\n\nAppeals against convictions\nThe ruling in Bates & Others v Post Office Ltd that the Horizon software contained \"bugs, errors, and defects\" that could cause shortfalls paved the way for subpostmasters to have their convictions overturned [94] In March 2020, the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) announced that it was referring thirty-nine cases for appeal on the grounds that their prosecutions were an abuse of process [108] More referrals followed and in May 2021 the Law Society Gazette reported that the organisation was 'not adequately resourced' if 200 cases were to be brought forward for review [109]\n\n\nR v Christopher Trousdale & Others – December 2020\nThe first subpostmaster appeals against convictions were heard at Southwark Crown Court before circuit judge Taylor, sitting as a deputy judge of the High Court The six cases were from magistrates' court convictions for theft, fraud and false accounting in London, Luton, Basingstoke, Oxford, Burton-upon-Trent and Scarborough between 2004 and 2012 The Post Office did not oppose the appeals and apologised for what they called \"historical failings.\" At the end of the hearing the judge said, \"I am sure that all of the appellants are grateful for the approach that the Post Office has taken finally to this matter and that it can be put to rest for them.\" [116]\n\n\nHamilton & Others vs Post Office Ltd – April 2021\nIn April 2021, after an appeal before three judges, Lord Justice Holroyde, Mr Justice Picken and Mrs Justice Farbey, thirty-nine of the convicted former postmasters had their convictions quashed The case was heard over four days in March 2021 The forty-two appellants were represented by seven teams of barristers; the Post Office representatives were led by Brian Altman QC [74] [117]\n\n\nCriticism and assessment of Hamilton\nIn October 2023, Moorhead, Nokes and Helm observed how relatively general the court had been in its consideration of the wrongs in Hamilton They emphasised lack of enquiry within the proceeding and the need to find out what had happened and why, and concluded that the Hamilton appeal itself requires investigation: [130]\n\n\nExoneration\nThis is one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in our nation's history People who worked hard to serve their communities had their lives and reputations destroyed, through absolutely no fault of their own The victims must get justice and compensation.. But today I can announce that we will introduce new primary legislation to make sure that those convicted as a result of the Horizon scandal are swiftly exonerated and compensated.\n\n\nLegislation\nThis is one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in our nation's history People who worked hard to serve their communities had their lives and reputations destroyed, through absolutely no fault of their own The victims must get justice and compensation.. But today I can announce that we will introduce new primary legislation to make sure that those convicted as a result of the Horizon scandal are swiftly exonerated and compensated.\n\n\nPost Office (Horizon System) Offences Act 2024 and Post Office (Horizon System) Compensation Act 2024\nThis is one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in our nation's history People who worked hard to serve their communities had their lives and reputations destroyed, through absolutely no fault of their own The victims must get justice and compensation.. But today I can announce that we will introduce new primary legislation to make sure that those convicted as a result of the Horizon scandal are swiftly exonerated and compensated.\n\n\nPost Office (Horizon System) Offences (Scotland) Act 2024\nThe Scottish Government criticised the UK legislation not covering Scotland [153]\n\n\nRedress and compensation\nThere are three schemes for different groups of victims: the overturned convictions scheme for those who were convicted; the Horizon shortfall scheme for those who suffered losses but were not convicted; and the GLO scheme those who took part in the group litigation [155] [156]\n\n\nPost Office Horizon IT Inquiry\nAfter the success of the JFSA in the Bates case against the Post Office, the organisation began to campaign to highlight the government's handling of the Post Office The alliance raised £100,000 through crowdfunding, to complain to the Parliamentary Ombudsman that the government had failed in its duty by allowing the Post Office to wrongly prosecute SPMs [177] The government resisted the complaint and declared that it had been lied to.\n\n\nFirst round of non-statutory hearings\nThe non-statutory inquiry, now titled The Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry and led by Sir Wyn Williams, began work in autumn 2020 and issued a call for evidence on 1 December 2020 The first public hearing took place on 15 January 2021 [185] During the non-statutory inquiry, two public hearings were held in early 2021 A preliminary hearing on the provisional List of Issues was held on 8 November 2021 [186]\n\n\nConversion to a statutory inquiry\nOn 19 May 2021, the government announced that an extended statutory inquiry into the scandal would deliver its conclusions in autumn 2022 Wyn Williams said that the inquiry would produce a statement of approach and that, in September 2021, a further statement would set out all relevant details [190] The extant non-statutory inquiry was formally converted to a statutory inquiry on 1 June 2021 with additional powers, including the ability to compel witnesses and demand evidence, with potential fines or imprisonment for non-compliance Scully said he and Sir Wyn had agreed that the context of the events had changed after convictions were quashed and hundreds more were expected to follow Boris Johnson said in May 2021: [191]\n\n\nPhases 1 to 4 of the Statutory Inquiry\nThe Phase 1 hearings, covering Human Impact, opened on 14 February 2022 at Juxon House in the City of London [196]\n\n\nInterim report\nThe inquiry issued an interim report on 17 July 2023 Its eight recommendations were: [205]\n\n\nPhases 5 to 7\nOn 9 April 2024, the inquiry commenced Phases five and six to cover \" [r]edress, access to justice, Second Sight, Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme, conduct of the group litigation, responding to the scandal, governance, monitoring of Horizon, contractual arrangements, internal and external audit, technical competence, stakeholder engagement, oversight and whistleblowing\" [207] Fifteen weeks were scheduled for the hearing of evidence [208]\n\n\nData leak\nOn 19 June 2024, the Post Office accidentally published a document on its corporate website containing the names and addresses of 555 former sub-postmasters who had been involved in litigation against the Post Office.\n\n\nCriminal investigation\nWhen handing down the Horizon issues judgment in December 2019, Fraser said he had passed a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions relating to evidence given by Fujitsu employees in actions brought by the Post Office [243] In January 2020, at the request of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Metropolitan Police initiated a criminal investigation into potential offences of perjury and perverting the course of justice during the investigations and prosecutions carried out by the Post Office [244] Two former Fujitsu expert witnesses were interviewed under caution [245] The Metropolitan Police confirmed in January 2024 that they were investigating possible additional offences of fraud in relation to \"monies recovered from sub-postmasters as a result of prosecutions or civil actions\" [244]\n\n\nRegulatory action\nIn January 2024, the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) confirmed that it is continuing to investigate \"live cases into a number of solicitors and law firms who were working on behalf of the Post Office/Royal Mail Group\" [247] The Bar Standards Board (which regulates barristers) is a core participant of the public inquiry, and said in February 2024 that no evidence heard by the inquiry \"indicates that any members of the Bar present an ongoing risk to the public that requires the BSB to act immediately\" [248]\n\n\nCall for reform on digital evidence\nIn May 2021, the British Computer Society, a professional body for those working in IT in the UK, called for reconsideration of courts' default presumption that computer data is correct [258] [259]\n\n\nMedia\n\n\nInvestigative reporting\nA Computer Weekly article written by Rebecca Thomson in July 2013 listed over 300 articles on the scandal published by the magazine, since it first broke the story in May 2009 with seven case studies [46] [263] [264] This first article was read by a Welsh BBC reporter, and in May 2009 BBC Wales went on to report that \"an investigation by a respected technical journal .. appeared to be calling into question the integrity of the Post Office Horizon system\" On 8 September 2009, the jailing of Anglesey subpostmaster Noel Thomas was covered on the S4C current affairs programme Taro Naw, making the claims of problems with Horizon, and interviewing Alan Bates, Lee Castleton and Jo Hamilton, who had featured in the Computer Weekly article The programme also uncovered a further nine subpostmasters who had been affected [265] [266] [267]\n\n\nDramatisation\nA four-part television drama, Mr Bates vs the Post Office, starring Toby Jones as Alan Bates, was broadcast over four evenings on ITV from 1 January 2024 [281] The drama brought the scandal to the centre of public and political attention [282] During the period of broadcast, an additional fifty victims contacted lawyers, five of whom seek to get criminal convictions quashed [245] As of 9 January, it was reported that over a hundred further potential victims had contacted lawyers following the broadcast [283] The drama was followed by a documentary, Mr Bates vs The Post Office: The Real Story, which included interviews with subpostmasters [284]\n\n\nSee

Office scandal refers to a series of events involving the prosecution of hundreds of subpostmasters by the Post Office for alleged theft and false accounting. The scandal began in the late 1990s and continued until the early 2010s, with many subpostmasters being imprisoned and others facing financial ruin.\n\n**Prosecutions**\n\nBetween 1999 and 2015, the Post Office and the statutory authorities of the UK, including the Crown Prosecution Service, the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland, and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service for Scotland, brought forward hundreds of criminal prosecutions of subpostmasters when the Horizon accounting system reported that money was missing from their post offices. In all, between 1999 and 2015, over 900 subpostmasters were prosecuted and 236 went to prison.\n\nThe Post Office itself prosecuted 700 people, acting as a private prosecutor in England and Wales. In Scotland, it reported allegations of crime to a procurator fiscal, and in Northern Ireland to the Public Prosecution Service. The Post Office's management structure at the time allowed it to act as a private prosecutor, which gave it a significant advantage in terms of resources and expertise.\n\n**Post Office Civil Cases against Subpostmasters**\n\nIn 2003, the Post Office pursued a civil claim against Julie Wolstenholme, subpostmaster at Cleveleys post office in Lancashire. The Post Office dropped its claim and settled Wolstenholme's counterclaim out of court after a jointly appointed expert, Jason Coyne, reported that discrepancies could have been caused by faults in Horizon. This was an early indication that Horizon may not have been reliable, but the Post Office continued to prosecute subpostmasters under the assumption that the system was sound.\n\n**Subpostmasters' Contracts**\n\nSubpostmasters are self-employed and run branch post offices under contract to the Post Office. They are responsible for managing the post office's finances and are expected to balance their own accounts with those of the Post Office. However, the Horizon system was not designed to be used by self-employed individuals, and it was not clear how it would handle the complex financial transactions that subpostmasters were required to manage.\n\n**Management Culture**\n\nIn July 2023, Parliament debated the Post Office's management culture, which was criticized for being overly aggressive and dismissive of subpostmasters' concerns. The then government representative, Tom Cooper, a senior civil servant, had been heavily criticized and had resigned following a scandal concerning Post Office bonuses and the slow disclosure of documents to the Horizon Inquiry. Writing in The Guardian in July 2023, Marina Hyde said: \"It remains something of a downer that the most widespread injustice in British legal history doesn't get the full-spectrum fever coverage that is lavished on more frivolous news – but then, the forces formerly known as The Man have always wanted this one covered up.\"\n\n**Tax Avoidance by Post Office Management**\n\nBBC business editor Simon Jack reported in January 2024 that the Post Office had underpaid more than £100m in tax by deducting payments to victims of the Horizon scandal from its profits. Tax expert Dan Neidle maintained that claiming tax relief for compensation paid to victims of the scandal could be a breach of the law, it could also mean that the business is at risk of insolvency and that senior executives may have been overpaid.\n\n**National Federation of Subpostmasters**\n\nThroughout the scandal, the National Federation of Subpostmasters (NFSP), which was wholly funded by the Post Office, insisted that Horizon was \"robust.\" However, the NFSP's position on Horizon was not supported by the evidence, and many subpostmasters who were members of the NFSP were prosecuted and imprisoned.\n\n**Post Office IT Systems**\n\nA 2020 article in Private Eye described the origins of Horizon, which was first used in 1999. However, the system was not designed to be used by subpostmasters, and it contained hundreds of bugs. Those that came to light were named after the post offices where the bug first occurred.\n\n**Problems with the Software**\n\nThe Horizon IT system contained \"hundreds\" of bugs. Those that came to light were named after the post offices where the bug first occurred. The bugs included the \"Dalmellington Bug,\" where the system would enter repeated withdrawals in the ledger every time the user pressed \"enter\" at a frozen interface screen; the \"Callendar Square Bug,\" where the system would create duplicate database entries in the ledger.\n\n**Investigating Post Office IT Problems**\n\nIn 2012, forensic accountants Second Sight were appointed by the Post Office to conduct an independent investigation of the Horizon software at the request of a group of MPs and the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance (JFSA). Second Sight issued an interim report in July 2013, which stated that, although \"we have so far found no evidence of system wide (systemic) problems with the Horizon software,\" the Post Office was aware of the existence of at least two defects or bugs in the software.\n\n**Mediation Scheme**\n\nAfter the publication of Second Sight's interim report, a mediation scheme for affected subpostmasters was set up in August 2013, to be funded by the Post Office and run by a working group comprising the Post Office, Second Sight, and the JFSA. However, the mediation scheme was criticized for being inadequate, and many subpostmasters were not awarded compensation.\n\n**Bates & Others v Post Office Ltd**\n\nWhen mediation with the Post Office broke down, the subpostmasters began to consult and combine their efforts into legal action. The action taken against the Post Office took the form first of group litigation in the name of Bates and others, a civil action in the High Court by some 555 people.

The first public hearing took place on 15 January 2021.\n\n**Conversion to a Statutory Inquiry**\n\nOn 19 May 2021, the government announced that an extended statutory inquiry into the scandal would deliver its conclusions in autumn 2022. Wyn Williams said that the inquiry would produce a statement of approach and that, in September 2021, a further statement would set out all relevant details.\n\n**Phases 1 to 4 of the Statutory Inquiry**\n\nThe Phase 1 hearings, covering Human Impact, opened on 14 February 2022 at Juxon House in the City of London.\n\n**Interim Report**\n\nThe inquiry issued an interim report on 17 July 2023. The eight recommendations were:\n\n1. The inquiry recommends that the Government establish an independent review of the Horizon system to assess its reliability and accuracy.\n2. The inquiry recommends that the Government take steps to implement the recommendations of the independent review.\n3. The inquiry recommends that the Government provide compensation to those who have been affected by the Horizon scandal.\n4. The inquiry recommends that the Government take steps to prevent similar scandals from happening in the future.\n5. The inquiry recommends that the Post Office take responsibility for the Horizon scandal and provide compensation to those who have been affected.\n6.

Wyn Williams's long-awaited and tirelessly fought-for inquiry is hearing evidence, except on the days it can't, because the Post Office is continually failing to hand over evidence.\"\n\n\nTax avoidance by Post Office management\nBBC business editor Simon Jack, on 12 January 2024, reported that the Post Office had underpaid more than £100m in tax by deducting payments to victims of the Horizon scandal from its profits Tax expert Dan Neidle maintained that claiming tax relief for compensation paid to victims of the scandal could be a breach of the law, it could also mean that the business is at risk of insolvency and that senior executives may have been overpaid Referring to notes in the most recent accounts, the BBC concludes that HM Revenue and Customs \"is investigating the way that the Post Office has accounted for the compensation payments and provisions\" [35] Heather Self, tax consultant, agreeing with Neidle's assessment said, \"The payments of compensation by the Post Office are almost certainly not deductible for corporation tax purposes, in my view.\" [35] Neidle maintains that the Post Office does not currently have enough money to pay a £100m tax bill and would be technically insolvent Although compensation payments seem to have been deducted from profits for tax purposes, they appear to have been ignored when calculating executive pay In year ending 2022 the CEO was paid a salary of £436,000 and a bonus of £137,000 [35] Neidle said: [35]\n\n\nNational Federation of Subpostmasters\n\nThroughout the scandal the National Federation of SubPostmasters (NFSP), which was wholly funded by the Post Office, insisted that Horizon was \"robust\" [36]: 34, 343  In February 2015, George Thomson, the General Secretary of the NFSP, told a House of Commons committee: [37]\n\nPost Office IT systems\nA 2020 article in Private Eye described the origins of Horizon: [40]\n\n\nProblems with the software\nThe Horizon IT system contained \"hundreds\" of bugs Those that came to light were named after the post offices where the bug first occurred These bugs included: the \"Dalmellington Bug,\" where the system would enter repeated withdrawals in the ledger every time the user pressed \"enter\" at a frozen interface screen; the \"Callendar Square Bug,\" where the system would create duplicate database entries in the ledger [41]\n\n\nInvestigating Post Office IT problems\nIn 2012 forensic accountants Second Sight were appointed by the Post Office to conduct an independent investigation of the Horizon software at the request of a group of MPs and the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance (JFSA) [56] Second Sight issued an interim report in July 2013 Their preliminary conclusions stated that, although \" [w]e have so far found no evidence of system wide (systemic) problems with the Horizon software\", the Post Office was aware of the existence of at least two defects or bugs in the software, one of which had occurred at least twice before being detected and fixed, which had led to false shortfalls in accounts at 76 branches The losses in two of these incidents had been identified by the Post Office and the subpostmasters had not been held liable, but one incident \"resulted in branches being asked to make good incorrect amounts.\" [48] [57] It also identified incidents when communication and hardware issues had caused account imbalances, noted the Post Office's failure to investigate reports of IT issues, and criticised the Post Office's focus on account recovery and prosecution over discovering how shortfalls had occurred [57] More than 100 subpostmasters were by this time saying that they had been prosecuted or forced to repay shortfalls created by Horizon [48]\n\n\nSecond Sight reports\nIn 2012 forensic accountants Second Sight were appointed by the Post Office to conduct an independent investigation of the Horizon software at the request of a group of MPs and the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance (JFSA) [56] Second Sight issued an interim report in July 2013 Their preliminary conclusions stated that, although \" [w]e have so far found no evidence of system wide (systemic) problems with the Horizon software\", the Post Office was aware of the existence of at least two defects or bugs in the software, one of which had occurred at least twice before being detected and fixed, which had led to false shortfalls in accounts at 76 branches The losses in two of these incidents had been identified by the Post Office and the subpostmasters had not been held liable, but one incident \"resulted in

investigate reports of IT issues, and criticised the Post Office's focus on account recovery and prosecution over discovering how shortfalls had occurred [57] More than 100 subpostmasters were by this time saying that they had been prosecuted or forced to repay shortfalls created by Horizon [48]\n\n\nMediation scheme\nAfter the publication of Second Sight's interim report, a mediation scheme for affected subpostmasters was set up in August 2013, to be funded by the Post Office and run by a working group comprising the Post Office, Second Sight and the JFSA and chaired by retired judge Sir Anthony Hooper [36]: 206  [28] Hooper doubted that the subpostmasters were dishonest and thought Horizon likely at fault [62] By December 2014, MPs were critical of the mediation scheme and 140 had withdrawn their support for it [63] James Arbuthnot, who was leading the 144 MPs who had been contacted by subpostmasters about the issue, accused the organisation of rejecting 90% of applications for mediation He said the Post Office had been \"duplicitous\", and suggested there would be legal and political campaigns in response [64]\n\n\nDetica report\nIn October 2013, Detica undertook a detailed analysis of the Post Office's systems It advised the Post Office that its systems were \"not fit for purpose in a modern retail and financial environment\" [70]\n\n\nClarke advice, CK Sift Review, Altman review\nFrom April 2012, the legal firm Cartwright King had a contract to handle Post Office prosecutions in England and Wales Simon Clarke, a barrister employed by Cartwright King, was assigned his first Post Office case in April or May 2013, and on 27 June he became aware that the forthcoming Second Sight report would describe two bugs in the Horizon Online software Clarke, wanting to know who had told Second Sight about the bugs, arranged a call the next day to Gareth Jenkins, a Fujitsu Services employee who had acted as an expert witness in several cases Jenkins said he had declared the two bugs to Second Sight, and was confident they did not compromise Horizon's audit trail, but went on to state \"you can never say there are no more bugs in the system\" Clarke quickly formed a view that Jenkins should not be used in future as an expert witness, and that use of Horizon data in past cases should be reviewed He made an ex parte public interest immunity application in the trial he was working on that was due to commence on 1 July [71] \"The basis of the application .. was the desire to prevent a widespread loss of confidence in a public institution or, a loss of trust in a system operated by such an institution or to prevent journalistic speculation about systems relied upon by the public.\" [72]\n\n\nDeloitte Review\nIn 2014 auditors from Deloitte found that branch accounts could be altered remotely by Fujitsu In February 2016 they began a further review, intending to look at Horizon transactions since its launch in 1999, but the Post Office halted their work four months later on legal advice after the subpostmasters had launched their group action [83]\n\n\nExposing the IT problems\nIn 2004, Bates approached Computer Weekly investigative journalist Tony Collins over suspicions about the Horizon IT system Five years elapsed before the journalists felt able to 'stand up' the story [84] Horizon was legally declared unreliable in Bates & Others v Post Office Ltd, in 2018 The unlawful nondisclosure of knowledge by the Post Office in its prosecution cases was established in law in the case of Hamilton & Others vs Post Office Ltd, in 2021.\n\n\nBates & Others v Post Office Ltd\nWhen mediation with the Post Office broke down, the subpostmasters began to consult and combine their efforts into legal action The action taken against the Post Office took the form first of group litigation in the name of Bates and others, a civil action in the High Court by some 555 people There were six lead claimants, and 23 common issues (that is issues common to all the cases) were identified and agreed to enable the court to examine the 555 cases The case was settled mid-trial by consent and without judgment as to costs; Post Office costs have been estimated as £100m [92] and those of the subpostmasters as £47m [93] The Post Office agreed to pay the subpostmasters £58 million, but after legal costs the claimants were left with £12 million to share [94] During the trial, which had been divided into a number of sub-trials, those acting for the Post Office attempted to persuade the judge to recuse himself Journalist and writer Nick Wallis, commenting on the two very senior lawyers who had advised the Post Office Board on the strategy, described it as \"misuse (of) a very serious instrument designed to aid fairness as a weapon purely for their wealthy client's benefit\" [95] At the Horizon inquiry, a former Post Office manager admitted that the ultimately lost case was seen by the Post Office as a way of \"killing off\" challenges to the Horizon system [96] Kathleen Donnelly, one of the barristers who acted for the subpostmasters in the case, said: [97] [98]\n\n\nAppeals against convictions\nThe ruling in Bates & Others v Post Office Ltd that the Horizon software contained \"bugs, errors, and defects\" that could cause shortfalls paved the way for subpostmasters to have their convictions overturned [94] In March 2020, the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) announced that it was referring thirty-nine cases for appeal on the grounds that their prosecutions were an abuse of process [108] More referrals followed and in May 2021 the Law Society Gazette reported that the organisation was 'not adequately resourced' if 200 cases were to be brought forward for review [109]\n\n\nR v Christopher Trousdale & Others – December 2020\nThe first subpostmaster appeals against convictions were heard at Southwark Crown Court before circuit judge Taylor, sitting as a deputy judge of the High Court The six cases were from magistrates' court convictions for theft, fraud and false accounting in London, Luton, Basingstoke, Oxford, Burton-upon-Trent and Scarborough between 2004 and 2012 The Post Office did not oppose the appeals and apologised for what they called \"historical failings.\" At the end of the hearing the judge said, \"I am sure that all of the appellants are grateful for the approach that the Post Office has taken finally to this matter and that it can be put to rest for them.\" [116]\n\n\nHamilton & Others vs Post Office Ltd – April 2021\nIn April 2021, after an appeal before three judges, Lord Justice Holroyde, Mr Justice Picken and Mrs Justice Farbey, thirty-nine of the convicted former postmasters had their convictions quashed The case was heard over four days in March 2021 The forty-two appellants were represented by seven teams of barristers; the Post Office representatives were led by Brian Altman QC [74] [117]\n\n\nCriticism and assessment of Hamilton\nIn October 2023, Moorhead, Nokes and Helm observed how relatively general the court had been in its consideration of the wrongs in Hamilton They emphasised lack of enquiry within the proceeding and the need to find out what had happened and why, and concluded that the Hamilton appeal itself requires investigation: [130]\n\n\nExoneration\nThis is one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in our nation's history People who worked hard to serve their communities had their lives and reputations destroyed, through absolutely no fault of their own The victims must get justice and compensation.. But today I can announce that we will introduce new primary legislation to make sure that those convicted as a result of the Horizon scandal are swiftly exonerated and compensated.\n\n\nLegislation\nThis is one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in our nation's history People who worked hard to serve their communities had their lives and reputations destroyed, through absolutely no fault of their own The victims must get justice and compensation.. But today I can announce that we will introduce new primary legislation to make sure that those convicted as a result of the Horizon scandal are swiftly exonerated and compensated.\n\n\nPost Office (Horizon System) Offences Act 2024 and Post Office (Horizon System) Compensation Act 2024\nThis is one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in our nation's history People who worked hard to serve their communities had their lives and reputations destroyed, through absolutely no fault of their own The victims must get justice and compensation.. But today I can announce that we will introduce new primary legislation to make sure that those convicted as a result of the Horizon scandal are swiftly exonerated and compensated.\n\n\nPost Office (Horizon System) Offences (Scotland) Act 2024\nThe Scottish Government criticised the UK legislation not covering Scotland [153]\n\n\nRedress and compensation\nThere are three schemes for different groups of victims: the overturned convictions scheme for those who were convicted; the Horizon shortfall scheme for those who suffered losses but were not convicted; and the GLO scheme those who took part in the group litigation [155] [156]\n\n\nPost Office Horizon IT Inquiry\nAfter the success of the JFSA in the Bates case against the Post Office, the organisation began to campaign to highlight the government's handling of the Post Office The alliance raised £100,000 through crowdfunding, to complain to the Parliamentary Ombudsman that the government had failed in its duty by allowing the Post Office to wrongly prosecute SPMs [177] The government resisted the complaint and declared that it had been lied to.\n\n\nFirst round of non-statutory hearings\nThe non-statutory inquiry, now titled The Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry and led by Sir Wyn Williams, began work in autumn 2020 and issued a call for evidence on 1 December 2020 The first public hearing took place on 15 January 2021 [185] During the non-statutory inquiry, two public hearings were held in early 2021 A preliminary hearing on the provisional List of Issues was held on 8 November 2021 [186]\n\n\nConversion to a statutory inquiry\nOn 19 May 2021, the government announced that an extended statutory inquiry into the scandal would deliver its conclusions in autumn 2022 Wyn Williams said that the inquiry would produce a statement of approach and that, in September 2021, a further statement would set out all relevant details [190] The extant non-statutory inquiry was formally converted to a statutory inquiry on 1 June 2021 with additional powers, including the ability to compel witnesses and demand evidence, with potential fines or imprisonment for non-compliance Scully said he and Sir Wyn had agreed that the context of the events had changed after convictions were quashed and hundreds more were expected to follow Boris Johnson said in May 2021: [191]\n\n\nPhases 1 to 4 of the Statutory Inquiry\nThe Phase 1 hearings, covering Human Impact, opened on 14 February 2022 at Juxon House in the City of London [196]\n\n\nInterim report\nThe inquiry issued an interim report on 17 July 2023 Its eight recommendations were: [205]\n\n\nPhases 5 to 7\nOn 9 April 2024, the inquiry commenced Phases five and six to cover \" [r]edress, access to justice, Second Sight, Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme, conduct of the group litigation, responding to the scandal, governance, monitoring of Horizon, contractual arrangements, internal and external audit, technical competence, stakeholder engagement, oversight and whistleblowing\" [207] Fifteen weeks were scheduled for the hearing of evidence [208]\n\n\nData leak\nOn 19 June 2024, the Post Office accidentally published a document on its corporate website containing the names and addresses of 555 former sub-postmasters who had been involved in litigation against the Post Office.\n\n\nCriminal investigation\nWhen handing down the Horizon issues judgment in December 2019, Fraser said he had passed a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions relating to evidence given by Fujitsu employees in actions brought by the Post Office [243] In January 2020, at the request of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Metropolitan Police initiated a criminal investigation into potential offences of perjury and perverting the course of justice during the investigations and prosecutions carried out by the Post Office [244] Two former Fujitsu expert witnesses were interviewed under caution [245] The Metropolitan Police confirmed in January 2024 that they were investigating possible additional offences of fraud in relation to \"monies recovered from sub-postmasters as a result of prosecutions or civil actions\" [244]\n\n\nRegulatory action\nIn January 2024, the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) confirmed that it is continuing to investigate \"live cases into a number of solicitors and law firms who were working on behalf of the Post Office/Royal Mail Group\" [247] The Bar Standards Board (which regulates barristers) is a core participant of the public inquiry, and said in February 2024 that no evidence heard by the inquiry \"indicates that any members of the Bar present an ongoing risk to the public that requires the BSB to act immediately\" [248]\n\n\nCall for reform on digital evidence\nIn May 2021, the British Computer Society, a professional body for those working in IT in the UK, called for reconsideration of courts' default presumption that computer data is correct [258] [259]\n\n\nMedia\n\n\nInvestigative reporting\nA Computer Weekly article written by Rebecca Thomson in July 2013 listed over 300 articles on the scandal published by the magazine, since it first broke the story in May 2009 with seven case studies [46] [263] [264] This first article was read by a Welsh BBC reporter, and in May 2009 BBC Wales went on to report that \"an investigation by a respected technical journal .. appeared to be calling into question the integrity of the Post Office Horizon system\" On 8 September 2009, the jailing of Anglesey subpostmaster Noel Thomas was covered on the S4C current affairs programme Taro Naw, making the claims of problems with Horizon, and interviewing Alan Bates, Lee Castleton and Jo Hamilton, who had featured in the Computer Weekly article The programme also uncovered a further nine subpostmasters who had been affected [265] [266] [267]\n\n\nDramatisation\nA four-part television drama, Mr Bates vs the Post Office, starring Toby Jones as Alan Bates, was broadcast over four evenings on ITV from 1 January 2024 [281] The drama brought the scandal to the centre of public and political attention [282] During the period of broadcast, an additional fifty victims contacted lawyers, five of whom seek to get criminal convictions quashed [245] As of 9 January, it was reported that over a hundred further potential victims had contacted

Noye left school at the age of 15 and spent a year in a borstal for selling stolen bicycles after having altered their appearance, among other crimes. During this time, he met a barrister's legal secretary, Brenda Tremain, who later became his wife.\n\n**Criminal Activities**\n\nNoye had established a relationship with corrupt officers by the time he was arrested for receiving stolen goods in 1977. He became a Freemason in January 1980 after being proposed for admission by two police officers, giving his occupation as \"builder.\" The membership of Noye's Lodge, located in Hammersmith, contained a sizeable proportion of officers. Noye's membership ceased in 1987 after he failed to pay his subscriptions for two years in succession. He was subsequently expelled from the Freemasons when it was discovered that he had a criminal record, according to the Grand Secretary of the United Grand Lodge of England.\n\n**Brink's-Mat Robbery**\n\nActive as a fence, Noye was among those involved in laundering a huge quantity of stolen gold bullion taken during the Brink's-Mat robbery on 26 November 1983. While he was being investigated for his involvement in the crime, Noye fatally stabbed Detective Constable John Fordham, who was involved in the police surveillance of Noye, in the grounds of his home on 26 January 1985. Acquitted of murder on the grounds of self-defence in December of that year, Noye was found guilty in July 1986 of conspiracy to handle some of the gold and of a conspiracy to evade VAT. After his conviction in court, Noye shouted to the jury \"I hope you all die of cancer!\"\n\n**Murder of Stephen Cameron**\n\nOn 19 May 1996, while on release from prison on licence, Noye was involved in a road rage incident with 21-year-old motorist Stephen Cameron on a slip road of the M25 motorway near Swanley in Kent. Noye stabbed Cameron to death with a nine-inch knife. He then fled the country with assistance from Palmer, who later claimed to have barely known Noye. While Noye was on the run, Detective Constable John Donald was jailed for eleven years for passing confidential information to him.\n\n**Alan Decabral Case**\n\nAnother eyewitness in the Cameron murder, Alan Decabral, declined protection and was shot dead in his car in front of shoppers through his open window in Ashford, Kent, on 5 October 2000. Police sources were in no doubt that Decabral was killed by a professional hitman. Police sources also stated that Decabral had been questioned about gun smuggling, had extensive criminal contacts, and his estranged wife later admitted that he had been a drug dealer who owed money to others. Although Noye was questioned by the police, they concluded that the unsolved murder had no proven connection with Noye and did not charge him.\n\n**Prison Sentence and Later Legal Proceedings**\n\nOn 10 October 2001 and again in 2004, Noye appealed unsuccessfully against his conviction. He was represented again by Michael Mansfield. In 2007 a legal challenge was made against the Criminal Cases Review Commission's decision not to refer his case to the Court of Appeal as \"legally flawed\".\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nNoye's wife, Brenda, lives in the east Cornwall town of Looe. They have two sons, one of whom, Brett, was banned in 2013 from being a company director for 12 years for his part in a £2.4 million investor deception scheme involving a rat poison company.\n\n**In Media**\n\nNoye is portrayed by Jack Lowden in The Gold, a 2023 BBC television drama about the Brink's-Mat robbery. The Gold: The Inside Story, an accompanying documentary, aired on BBC One a day after the drama's final episode.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Kenneth_Noye\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nKenneth Noye was born in Bexleyheath, Kent (now in Greater London), where his father ran a post office and his mother a dog racing track [1] A bully while a pupil at Bexleyheath Boys' Secondary Modern School, Noye ran a protection racket with his fellow pupils [2] He left school at age 15 [3] For selling stolen bicycles after having altered their appearance, among other crimes, he spent a year in a borstal Noye met a barrister's legal secretary, Brenda Tremain, who later became his wife [2]\n\n\nCriminal activities\nA police informant for many years, [4] Noye had established a relationship with corrupt officers by the time he was arrested for receiving stolen goods in 1977 [5] He became a Freemason in January 1980 after being proposed for admission by two police officers, giving his occupation as \"builder.\" The membership of Noye's Lodge, located in Hammersmith, contained a sizeable proportion of officers [5] Noye's membership ceased in 1987 after he failed to pay his subscriptions for two years in succession He was subsequently expelled from the Freemasons when it was discovered that he had a criminal record, according to the Grand Secretary of the United Grand Lodge of England [6]\n\n\nBrink's-Mat robbery\nActive as a fence, Noye was among those involved in laundering a huge quantity of stolen gold bullion taken during the Brink's-Mat robbery on 26 November 1983 [1] While he was being investigated for his involvement in the crime, Noye fatally stabbed Detective Constable John Fordham, who was involved in the police surveillance of Noye, in the grounds of his home on 26 January 1985 Acquitted of murder on the grounds of self-defence in December of that year, [7] he was found guilty in July 1986 [8] of conspiracy to handle some of the gold, [9] and of a conspiracy to evade VAT [1] After his conviction in court, Noye shouted to the jury \"I hope you all die of cancer!\" [10]\n\n\nMurder of Stephen Cameron\nOn 19 May 1996, while on release from prison on licence, Noye was involved in a road rage incident with 21-year-old motorist Stephen Cameron on a slip road of the M25 motorway near Swanley in Kent [14] [15] Noye stabbed Cameron to death with a nine-inch knife He then fled the country with assistance from Palmer, [16] who later claimed to have barely known Noye [17] While Noye was on the run, Detective Constable John Donald was jailed for eleven years for passing confidential information to him [18] [19]\n\n\nAlan Decabral case\nAnother eyewitness in the Cameron murder, Alan Decabral, [41] declined protection [42] and was shot dead in his car in front of shoppers through his open window in Ashford, Kent, on 5 October 2000 (some 6 months after Noye's conviction) Police sources were in no doubt that Decabral was killed by a professional hitman [43] [44] Police sources also stated that Decabral had been questioned about gun smuggling, [43] [45] had extensive criminal contacts, [42] and his estranged wife later admitted that he had been a drug dealer who owed money to others [46] Although Noye was questioned by the police, they concluded that the unsolved murder had no proven connection with Noye  and did not charge him [47] [44]\n\n\nPrison sentence and later legal proceedings\nOn 10 October 2001 [49] and again in 2004, [50] Noye appealed unsuccessfully against his conviction He was represented again by Michael Mansfield [51] In 2007 a legal challenge was made against the Criminal Cases Review Commission's decision not to refer his case to the Court of Appeal as \"legally flawed\" [52]\n\n\nPersonal life\nNoye's wife, Brenda, lives in the east Cornwall town of Looe They have two sons, [67] one of whom, Brett, was banned in 2013 from being a company director for 12 years for his part in a £2.4 million investor deception scheme involving a rat poison company [68]\n\n\nIn media\nNoye is portrayed by Jack Lowden in The Gold, a 2023 BBC television drama about the Brink's-Mat robbery [69] The Gold: The Inside Story, an accompanying documentary, aired on BBC One a day after the drama's final episode [70]\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Jeremy said he still could not understand why he had been convicted [166] From March 2001 several websites were set up to discuss the evidence, and in 2002 Jeremy used one of the sites to offer a £1 million reward for evidence that would overturn his conviction [205] Campaign events included a supporter reading a letter from Jeremy to his parents at their graveside, and a \"Bamber bake-off\" featuring his mother's favourite recipes [206]\n\n\nHealth\nSheila's mental health continued to decline, with episodes of banging her head against walls [31] In 1983 her family doctor referred her to Hugh Ferguson, the psychiatrist who had treated June Ferguson said Sheila was in an agitated state, paranoid and psychotic She was admitted to St Andrew's Hospital, a private psychiatric facility, where Ferguson diagnosed a schizoaffective disorder After Sheila was discharged in September 1983, he continued seeing her as an out-patient and concluded that his first diagnosis had been mistaken Ferguson now believed that she had schizophrenia and began treating her with trifluoperazine, an antipsychotic drug [32]\n\n\nJeremy Bamber\nJeremy Nevill Bamber was born on 13 January 1961 to a student midwife who, after an affair with a married British Army sergeant, gave her baby to the Church of England Children's Society when he was six weeks old His biological parents later married and had other children; his father became a senior staff member in Buckingham Palace [42] The Bambers adopted Jeremy when he was six months old They sent him to St Nicholas Primary, then along with Sheila to Maldon Court prep school This was followed when he was aged 9, in September 1970, by Gresham's School, a boarding school in Holt, Norfolk, [43] where he joined the cadet force [44] Jeremy was apparently unhappy at Gresham's because of bullying and other factors [43]\n\n\nExtended family, inheritance\nThe financial ties and inheritance issues within the immediate and extended family provided a motive and added a layer of complexity to the case The Bambers' company, N. and J. Bamber Ltd, was worth £400,000 in 1985 (c. £1,061,016 in 2021) In their wills, June left £230,000 (c. £608,000) and Nevill £380,000 (c. £1,004,000) [10] [58] During the trial, the court heard that the Bambers had left their estate to both Jeremy and Sheila, to be divided equally In addition, Nevill's will had said that, to inherit, Jeremy had to be working on the farm at the time of his father's death The court also heard, from Mugford's mother, that he had been saying June wanted to change her will to bypass him and Sheila and leave her estate to Sheila's twins instead [59]\n\n\nJeremy's visit to the farm\nOn Sunday, 4 August 1985, three days before the murders, Sheila and the boys arrived at White House Farm to spend the week with Nevill and June The housekeeper saw Sheila that day and noticed nothing unusual Two farm workers saw her the following day with her children and said she seemed happy [66] One of the crime scene photographs showed that someone had carved \"I hate this place\" into the cupboard doors of the bedroom in which the twins were sleeping [67]\n\n\nAtmosphere in the house\nOn Sunday, 4 August 1985, three days before the murders, Sheila and the boys arrived at White House Farm to spend the week with Nevill and June The housekeeper saw Sheila that day and noticed nothing unusual Two farm workers saw her the following day with her children and said she seemed happy [66] One of the crime scene photographs showed that someone had carved \"I hate this place\" into the cupboard doors of the bedroom in which the twins were sleeping [67]\n\n\nMurder weapon\nJeremy told the court that, hours before the murders on 6 August, he had loaded the rifle, thinking he heard rabbits outside, but had not used it He left the rifle on the kitchen table, with a full magazine and a box of ammunition, before leaving the house [73] It did not at that point have the silencer or telescopic sight attached, he claimed Both had been on the rifle in late July, according to a nephew, but Jeremy said his father must have removed them [74] The prosecution disputed this, maintaining that the silencer was on the rifle when the family was murdered [75]\n\n\nPolice logs, 7 August 1985\nThere were three telephones at White House Farm on the night of the shooting, all on the same landline [81] There was usually a cream rotary phone in the main bedroom on Nevill's bedside table; a beige Statesman phone in the kitchen; and a blue Sceptre 100 phone in the office on the first floor (There was a fourth phone too, an Envoy cordless phone in the kitchen, but it had been picked up for repair on 5 August.) The rotary phone had at some point been moved out of the main bedroom and into the kitchen, where the police found it with its receiver off the hook They found the Statesman phone still in the kitchen but hidden in a pile of magazines [82] [81] [c]\n\n\nTelephones in the farmhouse\nThere were three telephones at White House Farm on the night of the shooting, all on the same landline [81] There was usually a cream rotary phone in the main bedroom on Nevill's bedside table; a beige Statesman phone in the kitchen; and a blue Sceptre 100 phone in the office on the first floor (There was a fourth phone too, an Envoy cordless phone in the kitchen, but it had been picked up for repair on 5 August.) The rotary phone had at some point been moved out of the main bedroom and into the kitchen, where the police found it with its receiver off the hook They found the Statesman phone still in the kitchen but hidden in a pile of magazines [82] [81] [c]\n\n\nJeremy's call to police\nJeremy telephoned Chelmsford police station (and not the 999 emergency number) from his home in the early hours of 7 August to raise the alarm He told them he had received a telephone call from his father—from the landline at White House Farm to the landline at Bamber's home—to say that Sheila had \"gone berserk\" with a gun Jeremy said the line went dead in the middle of the call [84]\n\n\nLogs\nIn 2010 Jeremy's lawyers highlighted two police logs in support of his application to have his case referred back to the Court of Appeal The question was whether these logs support the prosecution position that there was one call that night to the police, from Jeremy alone, or the defence position that there were two calls, one from Nevill followed by a second from Jeremy [93]\n\n\nEvent log\nIn 2010 Jeremy's lawyers highlighted two police logs in support of his application to have his case referred back to the Court of Appeal The question was whether these logs support the prosecution position that there was one call that night to the police, from Jeremy alone, or the defence position that there were two calls, one from Nevill followed by a second from Jeremy [93]\n\n\nRadio log\nMichael Bonnett, a civilian dispatcher in Chelmsford police station's information room, began a \"radio log\" which kept track of messages about the situation The radio log discusses a telephone call made at 3:26 am on 7 August [98] According to the prosecution, this is the call known to have been made by Jeremy, the same call entered in the event log [93] According to the defence, the radio log is not simply a duplicate log of Jeremy's call but a log of a separate call to the police by Nevill [99]\n\n\nScene at White House Farm\nAfter the telephone calls, Jeremy drove to the farmhouse, as did three officers from Witham police station who later testified that he had been driving much more slowly than them; they passed him on Pages Lane and arrived at the farmhouse one or two minutes before him Jeremy's cousin, Ann Eaton, testified that he was normally a fast driver [100] [101] The group waited outside the house for a tactical firearms unit to arrive, which turned up at 5 am and decided to wait until daylight before trying to enter Police determined that all the doors and windows to the house were shut except for the window in the main bedroom on the first floor Using a loudhailer, they spent two hours trying to communicate with Sheila The only sound they reported from the house was a dog barking [100] [102]\n\n\nEvents outside\nAfter the telephone calls, Jeremy drove to the farmhouse, as did three officers from Witham police station who later testified that he had been driving much more slowly than them; they passed him on Pages Lane and arrived at the farmhouse one or two minutes before him Jeremy's cousin, Ann Eaton, testified that he was normally a fast driver [100] [101] The group waited outside the house for a tactical firearms unit to arrive, which turned up at 5 am and decided to wait until daylight before trying to enter Police determined that all the doors and windows to the house were shut except for the window in the main bedroom on the first floor Using a loudhailer, they spent two hours trying to communicate with Sheila The only sound they reported from the house was a dog barking [100] [102]\n\n\nScene inside\nThe police entered the farmhouse at 7:54 am, using a sledgehammer to break the back door The door had been locked from the inside, with the key still in the lock [100] [105] They found five bodies with multiple gunshot wounds, Nevill downstairs in the kitchen and the rest upstairs [106] Twenty-five shots had been fired, mostly at close range [107] In what order the family was killed is not known [62] A telephone was lying on one of the kitchen surfaces with its receiver off the hook, next to empty .22 cartridge cases The police said chairs and stools were overturned, and there was broken crockery, a broken sugar basin, a broken ceiling light, and what looked like blood on the floor [108]\n\n\nApparent struggle\nThe police entered the farmhouse at 7:54 am, using a sledgehammer to break the back door The door had been locked from the inside, with the key still in the lock [100] [105] They found five bodies with multiple gunshot wounds, Nevill downstairs in the kitchen and the rest upstairs [106] Twenty-five shots had been fired, mostly at close range [107] In what order the family was killed is not known [62] A telephone was lying on one of the kitchen surfaces with its receiver off the hook, next to empty .22 cartridge cases The police said chairs and stools were overturned, and there was broken crockery, a broken sugar basin, a broken ceiling light, and what looked like blood on the floor [108]\n\n\nNevill\nNevill was found in the kitchen, dressed in pyjamas, lying over an overturned chair next to the fireplace, amid a scene suggestive of a struggle [108] He had been shot eight times, six times to the head and face, fired when the rifle was a few inches from his skin The remaining shots to his body had occurred from at least two feet away Based on where the empty cartridge cases were found—three in the kitchen and one on the stairs—the police concluded that he had been shot four times upstairs, but had managed to get downstairs where a struggle took place, and during which he was hit several times with the rifle and shot again, this time fatally [109]\n\n\nJune\nJune's body and clothing were heavily bloodstained; she was found in her nightdress with bare feet The police believe she had been sitting up during part of the attack, based on the pattern of blood on her clothing She was found lying on the floor by the door of the master bedroom June had been shot seven times One shot to her forehead, between her eyes, was fired from under one foot (30 cm) away That and another shot to the right side of her head would both have caused her death quickly, the court heard There were also shots to the right side of her lower neck and to her right forearm, and two injuries on the right side of her chest and right knee [111]\n\n\nDaniel and Nicholas\nThe boys were found in their beds in their own room (formerly Sheila's room) They appeared to have been shot while in bed The court heard that Daniel had been shot five times in the back of the head, four times with the gun held within one foot (30 cm) of his head, and once from over two feet (60 cm) away Nicholas had been shot three times, all contact or close-proximity shots [112]\n\n\nSheila\nSheila was found on the floor of the master bedroom with her mother She was in her nightdress, her feet were bare, and she had two bullet wounds under her chin, one of them on her throat The pathologist, Peter Vanezis, said that the lower of the injuries had occurred from three inches (76 mm) away and that the higher one was a contact injury The higher of the two would have killed her immediately The lower injury would have killed her too, he said, but not necessarily straight away Vanezis testified that it would be possible for a person with such an injury to stand up and walk around, but the lack of blood on her nightdress suggested to him that she had not done this He believed that the lower of her injuries had happened first because it had caused bleeding inside the neck; the court heard that if the immediately fatal wound had happened first, the bleeding would not have occurred to the same extent The pattern of bloodstains on her nightdress suggested she had been sitting up when she received both injuries, Vanezis said [113]\n\n\nPolice investigation\nThe police and media were initially convinced by the murder-suicide theory Detective Chief Inspector Thomas Jones, deputy head of CID, was so sure Sheila had killed her family that he ordered Jeremy's cousins out of his office when they asked him to consider whether Jeremy had set the whole thing up [97] [118] The Daily Express reported on 8 August 1985, the day after the murders:\n\n\nMurder-suicide theory, crime scene\nThe police and media were initially convinced by the murder-suicide theory Detective Chief Inspector Thomas Jones, deputy head of CID, was so sure Sheila had killed her family that he ordered Jeremy's cousins out of his office when they asked him to consider whether Jeremy had set the whole thing up [97] [118] The Daily Express reported on 8 August 1985, the day after the murders:\n\n\nFuneral, Bamber's behaviour\nThe inquest into the murders was opened on 14 August 1985 The police gave evidence that the killings constituted a murder–suicide, [97] and the bodies were released Nevill, June and Sheila were cremated; the boys were buried Jeremy's behaviour before and after the funeral increased suspicion among his family that he had been involved; they alleged that he sobbed during the funeral service for his parents and sister, and at one point seemed to buckle and had to be supported by Mugford, but that he was smiling and joking later at the wake [122]\n\n\nFingerprints on rifle\nA print from Sheila's right ring finger was found on the right side of the butt of the rifle, pointing downwards A print from Jeremy's right forefinger was on the rear end of the barrel, above the stock and pointing across the gun He said he had used the gun to shoot rabbits There were three other prints that could not be identified [126]\n\n\nSilencer\nThe silencer was not on the gun when the bodies were discovered It was found by one of Jeremy's cousins, three days after the murders, in the ground-floor office gun cupboard [127] Whether it was on the gun during the murders became a pivotal issue The prosecution maintained that the silencer had indeed been on the gun, and that this meant Sheila could not have shot herself Forensic tests indicated that her arms were not long enough to turn the gun on herself with the silencer attached [f] If she had shot the others with the silencer, then realized the gun was too long for her to shoot herself, the silencer would have been found next to her body; she had no reason to return it to the gun cupboard before going back upstairs to shoot herself If Sheila was not the killer, it meant Jeremy had lied about the telephone call from his father saying Sheila had \"gone berserk\" with the gun [129]\n\n\nScratch marks on mantelpiece\nJeremy's cousins returned to the farmhouse to search for the source of the red paint on the silencer In the kitchen they found marks in the red paint on the underside of the mantelpiece above an AGA cooker A sample taken by a scenes-of-crime officer was found to contain the same fifteen layers of paint and varnish that were in the paint flake found on the silencer Casts of the marks on the mantelpiece were deemed consistent with the silencer having come into contact with the mantel several times [133]\n\n\nJulie Mugford's statements\nOn 7 September 1985, a month after the murders, Mugford changed her statement to police, now alleging that Jeremy had been planning to kill his family As a result of her second statement, he was arrested the following day [134]\n\n\nBackground\nA campaign, known from November 2015 as JB Campaign Ltd, gathered pace over the years to secure Jeremy's release [204] The civil-liberties group Justice for All took up his case in 1993 to prepare for his appeal that year, and The Guardian ran a long investigative piece by Jim Shelley in November 1993 that included a telephone interview with Jeremy from HMP Long Martin, Worcestershire; Jeremy said he still could not understand why he had been convicted [166] From March 2001 several websites were set up to discuss the evidence, and in 2002 Jeremy used one of the sites to offer a £1 million reward for evidence that would overturn his conviction [205] Campaign events included a supporter reading a letter from Jeremy to his parents at their graveside, and a \"Bamber bake-off\" featuring his mother's favourite recipes [206]\n\n\nStatements to police\nMugford was initially supportive of Jeremy Photographs of his parents' and Sheila's funeral show him weeping and hanging onto her arm During an interview with the police on the day after the murders, she said that Jeremy had telephoned her at home in the early hours of 7 August, between 3:00 and 3:30 am, and said, \"There's something wrong at home,\" and sounded worried She said she had been tired and had not asked what was wrong [137]\n\n\n\"Tonight or never\" allegation\nMugford said she had spent the weekend before the murders with Jeremy in his cottage in Goldhanger, where he had dyed his hair black She had seen his mother's bicycle there, she said; the prosecution later alleged that he had used this bicycle to cycle between his cottage and White House Farm on the night of the murders to avoid being seen in his car on the road Mugford told police that Jeremy had telephoned her at 9:50 pm on 6 August to say he had been thinking about the crime all day, was \"pissed off\", and that it was \"tonight or never\" A few hours later, at 3:00–3:30 am on 7 August, Mugford said he phoned her again to say: \"Everything is going well Something is wrong at the farm I haven't had any sleep all night .. bye honey and I love you lots.\" Her flatmates' evidence suggested that call had come through closer to 3:00 am Jeremy called later in the morning to tell Mugford that Sheila had gone mad and that a police car was coming to pick her up When she arrived with the police at Jeremy's cottage, she said he had pulled her to one side and said: \"I should have been an actor.\" [144] [146]\n\n\nLetter about Mugford\nA letter dated 26 September 1985 from the assistant director of public prosecutions who prepared the case against Jeremy suggests that Mugford not be prosecuted for the burglary, the cheque fraud, and a further offence of selling cannabis Mugford subsequently testified against Jeremy during his trial in October 1986 The judge told the jury that they could convict Jeremy on Mugford's testimony alone [147] [148] Immediately after the verdict was announced, Mugford sold her story to the News of the World for £25,000 (equivalent to £93,000 in 2,023) [149] [58]\n\n\nBamber's arrest\nAs a result of Mugford's statement, Jeremy was arrested on 8 September 1985, as was the friend Mugford said he had implicated, although the latter had a solid alibi and was released Jeremy told police Mugford was lying because he had jilted her He said he loved his parents and sister, and denied that they had kept him short of money; he claimed the only reason he had broken into the caravan site with Mugford was to prove that security was poor He further claimed he had occasionally gained entry to the farmhouse through a downstairs window and had used a knife to move the catches from the outside He also claimed he had seen his parents' wills, and that they had left the estate to be shared between him and Sheila As for the rifle, Jeremy told police the gun was used mostly with the silencer off because it would otherwise not fit in its case [134]\n\n\nTrial, October 1986\nJeremy's trial, which lasted eighteen days, opened on 3 October 1986 before Mr Justice Drake and a jury of seven men and five women at Chelmsford Crown Court [153] [18] The prosecution was led by Anthony Arlidge QC, and the defence by Geoffrey Rivlin QC, supported by Ed Lawson QC [97] The Times wrote that Jeremy cut an arrogant figure in the witness box At one point, when prosecutors accused him of lying, he replied: \"That is what you have got to establish.\" [4]\n\n\nProsecution case\nJeremy's trial, which lasted eighteen days, opened on 3 October 1986 before Mr Justice Drake and a jury of seven men and five women at Chelmsford Crown Court [153] [18] The prosecution was led by Anthony Arlidge QC, and the defence by Geoffrey Rivlin QC, supported by Ed Lawson QC [97] The Times wrote that Jeremy cut an arrogant figure in the witness box At one point, when prosecutors accused him of lying, he replied: \"That is what you have got to establish.\" [4]\n\n\nDefence case\nThe defence maintained that the witnesses who said Jeremy disliked his family were lying or had misinterpreted his words Mugford had lied about his confession, they said, because he had betrayed her No one had seen Jeremy cycle to and from the farm There were no marks on him on the night in question that suggested he had been in a fight No blood-stained clothing of his was recovered He had not driven to the farm as quickly as he could have after his father telephoned because he was afraid, they said There was no probative value in the finding of a hacksaw in the garden, because Jeremy had entered the house via the windows many times, before the killings and since [158]\n\n\nSumming up, verdict\nThe judge told the jury that there were three crucial points, in no particular order Did they believe Mugford or Jeremy? Were they sure that Sheila was not the killer who then committed suicide? He said this question involved another: was the second, fatal, shot fired at Sheila with the silencer on? If yes, she could not have fired it Finally, did Nevill call Jeremy in the middle of the night? If there was no such call, it undermined the entirety of Jeremy's story; the only reason he would have had to invent the phone call was that he was responsible for the murders [85]\n\n\nAppeals\nJeremy first sought leave to appeal in November 1986, arguing that the judge had misdirected the jury The application was heard and refused by Mr Justice Caulfield in April 1988 [162] During a full hearing in March 1989 before three Appeal Court judges—Lord Lane, the Lord Chief Justice; Mr Justice Roch; and Mr Justice Henry [163]—Jeremy's lawyer, Geoffrey Rivlin QC, argued that the trial judge's summing up had been biased against his client, that his language had been too forceful, and that he had undermined the defence by advancing his own theory Rivlin also argued that the defence had not pressed Mugford about her dealings with the media but should have, because as soon as the trial was over her story began to appear in newspapers [162] [164] On 20 March 1989 the judges refused Jeremy leave to appeal, ruling that there was nothing unsafe or unsatisfactory about the verdicts [163]\n\n\nLeave to appeal refused, 1989 and 1994\nJeremy first sought leave to appeal in November 1986, arguing that the judge had misdirected the jury The application was heard and refused by Mr Justice Caulfield in April 1988 [162] During a full hearing in March 1989 before

that there was nothing unsafe or unsatisfactory about the verdicts [163]\n\n\nCourt of Appeal, 2002\nIn 1997 the Home Office passed Jeremy's case to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which had just been established to review alleged miscarriages of justice In March 2001 the CCRC referred the case to the Court of Appeal because of the discovery of DNA inside the silencer; this was found as a result of a test not available in 1986 and constituted fresh evidence [170] [171] Jeremy's conviction rested in part on evidence that Sheila's blood had been found inside the silencer, suggesting that it had been on the gun when she died; but her arms were not long enough to point the gun back at herself and pull the trigger with the silencer attached [172] The appeal was heard from 17 October to 1 November 2002, at the Royal Courts of Justice, by Lord Justice Kay, Mr Justice Wright and Mr Justice Henriques, who published their decision on 12 December 2002 [2] The prosecution was represented by Victor Temple QC and Jeremy by Michael Turner QC [173] In a 522-paragraph judgment, the judges concluded that there was no conduct on the part of investigators that threatened the integrity of the trial, and that the more they examined the case, the more they thought the jury had been right [174] [175]\n\n\nCriminal Cases Review Commission referral\nIn 1997 the Home Office

was no conduct on the part of investigators that threatened the integrity of the trial, and that the more they examined the case, the more they thought the jury had been right [174] [175]\n\n\nGrounds\nJeremy initially brought sixteen issues to the attention of the court [176] Two (grounds 14 and 15) related to the silencer and DNA testing; the rest were about failure to disclose evidence or the fabrication of evidence [177] The defence withdrew ground 11 (\"the proposed purchase of a Porsche by the appellant\") before the hearing [178] [179]\n\n\nNew silencer evidence\nAlthough all the grounds (except 11) were reviewed by the court, the CCRC referred the case to the Court of Appeal on the basis of ground 15, the discovery of DNA on the silencer, the result of a test not available in 1986 [195] The silencer evidence during the trial had come from John Hayward, a biologist in private practice, formerly of the FSS He had found a \"considerable amount of blood\" inside the silencer; he had stated that it was human blood and that the blood group was consistent with it having come from Sheila He said there was a \"remote possibility\" that it was a mixture of blood from Nevill and June [196]\n\n\nAgainst whole-life tariff\nIn 2008 Jeremy lost a High Court appeal before Mr Justice Tugendhat against his whole-life tariff [200] This was upheld by the Court of Appeal in 2009 [201] Jeremy and three other British whole-life prisoners appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, but the appeal was rejected in 2012 [202] Jeremy and two of the prisoners (one of them the serial killer Peter Moore) appealed that decision, and in 2013 the European Court's Grand Chamber ruled that keeping the prisoners in jail with no prospect of release or review may not have been compatible with Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment [203]\n\n\nCampaign\nA campaign, known from November 2015 as JB Campaign Ltd, gathered pace over the years to secure Jeremy's release [204] The civil-liberties group Justice for All took up his case in 1993 to prepare for his appeal that year, and The Guardian ran a long investigative piece by Jim Shelley in November 1993 that included a telephone interview with Jeremy from HMP Long Martin, Worcestershire; Jeremy said he still could not understand why he had been convicted [166] From March 2001 several websites were set up to discuss the evidence, and in 2002 Jeremy used one of the sites to offer a £1 million reward for evidence that would overturn his conviction [205] Campaign events included a supporter reading a letter from Jeremy to his parents at their graveside, and a \"Bamber bake-off\" featuring his mother's favourite recipes [206]\n\n\nBackground\nA campaign, known from November 2015 as JB Campaign Ltd, gathered pace over the years to secure Jeremy's release [204] The civil-liberties group Justice for All took up

\"Bamber bake-off\" featuring his mother's favourite recipes [206]\n\n\nCampaign's arguments\nThe defence disputed the location of Sheila's body The police said they had found her upstairs with her mother According to early police logs, one officer reported seeing through a window what he thought was the body of a woman near the kitchen door, but he later radioed that it was a man [211] A retired police officer who worked on the case said in 2011 that the first police logs were simply mistaken in reporting that a woman's body had been found downstairs [212] Jeremy's lawyers argued that images of Sheila taken by a police photographer at around 9 am on 7 August 1985 showed that her blood was still wet According to the defence team, had she been killed before 3:30 am, as the prosecution said, the blood would have congealed by 9 am They argued that she was alive when Jeremy was standing outside the house with the police, shot herself in the kitchen just as the police entered, then ran up one of the staircases to the bedroom, where she shot herself again, this time fatally [213]\n\n\nLocation of Sheila's body, time of death\nThe defence disputed the location of Sheila's body The police said they had found her upstairs with her mother According to early police logs, one officer reported seeing through a window what he thought was the body of a woman near the kitchen door, but he later radioed that it was a man [211] A retired police officer who worked on the case said in 2011 that the first police logs were simply mistaken in reporting that a woman's body had been found downstairs [212] Jeremy's lawyers argued that images of Sheila taken by a police photographer at around 9 am on 7 August 1985 showed that her blood was still wet According to the

police, shot herself in the kitchen just as the police entered, then ran up one of the staircases to the bedroom, where she shot herself again, this time fatally [213]\n\n\nAlleged crime-scene damage\nThe defence argued that the first officers to enter the farmhouse had inadvertently disturbed the crime scene, then reconstructed it Crime-scene photographs not made available to the original defence show Sheila's right arm and hand in slightly different positions in relation to the gun, which is lying across her body The gun itself also appears to have moved Former Detective Chief Superintendent Mick Gradwell of Lancashire Constabulary, shown the photographs by The Guardian, said in 2011: \"The evidence shows, or portrays, Essex police having damaged the scene, and then having staged it again to make it look like it was originally And if that has happened, and that hasn't been disclosed, that is really, really serious.\" [214]\n\n\nArguments about the silencer\nThe contention that the gun had a silencer on it during the murders was central to the prosecution's case; Jeremy and his lawyers have sought since 1987 to discredit the silencer evidence With the silencer fitted, the gun was too long for Sheila to have turned it on herself According to the prosecution, paint on the silencer could be matched to fresh scratch marks on the kitchen mantelpiece, assumed to have been made during a fight for the gun That the silencer was found in the gun cupboard was important to the prosecution, because Sheila had no reason to return it to the cupboard before killing herself But that it was found by one of the cousins who inherited part of the estate—days after the police had searched the house—blighted the prosecution's case, although it was accepted by a majority of the jury [215] [g]\n\n\nArguments about scratch marks\nThe defence commissioned a report from Peter Sutherst, a British forensic photographic expert, who was asked in 2008 to examine negatives of the kitchen taken on the day of the murders and later In his report, dated 17 January 2010, Sutherst argued that the scratch marks in the red paintwork on the kitchen mantelpiece had been created after the crime-scene photographs had been taken The prosecution alleged that the marks had been made during the struggle in the kitchen between Bamber and his father, as the silencer, attached to the rifle, had scratched against the mantelpiece The prosecution said that paint chips identical to the paint on the mantelpiece had been found on or inside the silencer [220] [221] [222] Sutherst said the scratch marks appeared in photographs taken on 10 September 1985, 34 days after the murders, but were not visible in the original crime-scene photographs He also said he had failed to find in the photographs any chipped paint on the carpet below the mantelpiece, where it might have been expected to fall had the mantelpiece been scratched during a struggle [220] Sutherst was asked by the CCRC to examine a red spot on the carpet visible in photographs underneath the scratches on the mantelpiece He said the red spot matched a piece of nail varnish missing from one of Sheila's toes [223] Sutherst concluded that the scratch marks on the mantel had been created after the day of the murders [220]\n\n\nArguments about police logs\nPolice telephone logs had been entered as evidence during the trial, but had not been noticed by Jeremy's lawyers Jeremy's new defence team based their new CCRC submissions in part on these logs, particularly on the radio log that, they say, shows Nevill called police that night to say his daughter had \"gone berserk\" with one of his guns [93] A separate log of a police radio message shows there was an attempt to speak to someone inside the farmhouse that night, as police waited outside to enter, but there was no response Police say the officers simply made a mistake [224]\n\n\nArguments about Mugford letter\nJeremy's lawyers argued that the 26 September 1985 letter to Mugford from John Walker, assistant director of public prosecutions, raised the possibility that she had been persuaded to testify in the hope that charges against her would not be pursued In the letter, Walker had suggested to the Chief Constable of Essex Police, \"with considerable hesitation\", that Mugford not be prosecuted for drug offences, burglary and cheque fraud, offences to which she had confessed during her police interviews regarding Bamber [147] The defence team also highlighted that, as soon as the verdict was announced, Mugford sold her story to the News of the World for £25,000 (equivalent to £92,526 in 2023) [149]\n\n\nCriminal Cases Review Commission, 2004–2012\nIn 2004 Jeremy's defence team, which included Giovanni di Stefano, [209] applied unsuccessfully to have the CCRC refer the case back to the Court of Appeal [225] His lawyers made a fresh submission to the CCRC in 2009 [226] The CCRC provisionally rejected Jeremy's 2009 submission in February 2011 in an 89-page document It invited his lawyers to respond within three months, extended the deadline to allow them to study all 406 crime-scene photographs, [226] [227] and in September 2011 granted them an indefinite period in which to pursue an additional line of inquiry [228]\n\n\nIn popular media\nThe case became the subject of a television drama series, White House Farm, starring Freddie Fox as Bamber and Cressida Bonas as Sheila, broadcast in January 2020 on ITV in the UK and HBO Max in the United States [232] [233] In 2021, documentary maker Louis Theroux produced a four-part series for Sky Crime on the murders, titled The Bambers: Murder At The Farm [234] Theroux told the Radio Times that the series had to be extended from an initial three-episode format due to the complexities of the case, [235] and told Sky News that \"both scenarios have anomalies\" [234]\n\n\nSee also\nBooks and long-form journalism\n\n\nSources\nBooks

"en", "article": "The White House Farm murders were a series of murders that took place on August 7, 1985, at White House Farm in Tolleshunt D'Arcy, Essex, England. The murders involved the deaths of five members of the Bamber family: Nevill Bamber, his wife June Bamber, their daughter Sheila Caffell, and her twin sons Daniel and Nicholas Caffell.\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe White House Farm murders were a highly publicized and shocking crime that took place in 1985. The case was highly unusual due to the number of victims and the circumstances surrounding the murders. The case was also notable for the fact that the main suspect, Jeremy Bamber, was convicted of the murders and sentenced to life in prison. However, over the years, there have been numerous appeals and investigations into the case, with some raising doubts about Jeremy's guilt.\n\n# The Bamber Family\n\nThe Bamber family was a wealthy and influential family in Essex. Nevill Bamber, the patriarch of the family, was a farmer and a former RAF pilot. He was known for his strict and conservative views, and he was also a magistrate. Nevill's wife, June, was a homemaker and a member of the Church of England. Their daughter, Sheila, was a former model and a student at the time of her death. Sheila had been adopted by the Bambers as a baby, and she had a troubled relationship with her adoptive parents. Sheila was known to have struggled with mental health issues and had a history of self-harm.\n\n## Adoption and Background\n\nSheila was born in 1957 to a young unmarried woman, who had been placed in a church-run home for unwed mothers. The child was then adopted by the Bambers when she was just a few months old. The Bambers had been selected as adoptive parents by the church due to their good reputation and their experience with children. However, Sheila's adoptive parents would later become increasingly strict and controlling, which would contribute to her troubled relationship with them.\n\n# T", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"White_House_Farm_murders\" following this outline:\n\n\nBamber family\nRalph Nevill Bamber (known as 'Nevill', born 8 June 1924) was a farmer, former Royal Air Force (RAF) pilot and magistrate at the local Witham magistrates' court He and his wife, June (née Speakman, born 3 June 1924), had married in 1949 and moved into the Georgian White House Farm on Pages Lane, Tolleshunt D'Arcy, Essex, set among 300 acres (120 ha) of tenant farmland that had belonged to June's father [6] The Court of Appeal described Nevill as \"a well-built man, 6 ft 4 in (193 cm) tall and in good physical health.\" This became significant because Jeremy's defence later suggested that Sheila, a slim woman aged 28, had been able to beat and subdue her father, something the prosecution contested [7]\n\n\nJune and Nevill Bamber\nRalph Nevill Bamber (known as 'Nevill', born 8 June 1924) was a farmer, former Royal Air Force (RAF) pilot and magistrate at the local Witham magistrates' court He and his wife, June (née Speakman, born 3 June 1924), had married in 1949 and moved into the Georgian White House Farm on Pages Lane, Tolleshunt D'Arcy, Essex, set among 300 acres (120 ha) of tenant farmland that had belonged to June's father [6] The Court of Appeal described Nevill as \"a well-built man, 6 ft 4 in (193 cm) tall and in good physical health.\" This became significant because Jeremy's defence later suggested that Sheila, a slim woman aged 28, had been able to beat and subdue her father, something the prosecution contested [7]\n\n\nDaniel and Nicholas Caffell\nDaniel and Nicholas Caffell (born 22 June 1979) were born to Sheila and Colin Caffell, who married in 1977 and divorced in 1982 Colin was an art student when he met Sheila Both parents were involved in the children's upbringing after the divorce, [13] although the boys were briefly placed in foster care in 1982–83 because of Sheila's health problems [14] For several months before the murders they had been living with Colin in his home in Kilburn, North London, not far from Sheila's residence in Maida Vale [15]\n\n\nSheila Caffell\nSheila Jean \"Bambi\" Caffell (born 18 July 1957)  [19] was born to the 18-year-old daughter of Eric Jay, a senior chaplain to the Archbishop of Canterbury At his insistence, the baby was placed for adoption Her mother gave Sheila up to the Church of England Children's Society two weeks after the birth, and the Bambers adopted her in October 1957 The chaplain had known Nevill in the RAF and selected the Bambers from a list of prospective adopters [20]\n\n\nBackground\nA campaign, known from November 2015 as JB Campaign Ltd, gathered pace over the years to secure Jeremy's release [204] The civil-liberties group Justice for All took up his case in 1993 to prepare for his appeal that year, and The Guardian ran a long investigative piece by Jim Shelley in November 1993 that included a telephone interview with Jeremy from HMP Long Martin, Worcestershire; Jeremy said he still could not understand why he had been convicted [166] From March 2001 several websites were set up to discuss the evidence, and in 2002 Jeremy used one of the sites to offer a £1 million reward for evidence that would overturn his conviction [205] Campaign events included a supporter reading a letter from Jeremy to his parents at their graveside, and a \"Bamber bake-off\" featuring his mother's favourite recipes [206]\n\n\nHealth\nSheila's mental health continued to decline, with episodes of banging her head against walls [31] In 1983 her family doctor referred her to Hugh Ferguson, the psychiatrist who had treated June Ferguson said Sheila was in an agitated state, paranoid and psychotic She was admitted to St Andrew's Hospital, a private psychiatric facility, where Ferguson diagnosed a schizoaffective disorder After Sheila was discharged in September 1983, he continued seeing her as an out-patient and concluded that his first diagnosis had been mistaken Ferguson now believed that she had schizophrenia and began treating her with trifluoperazine, an antipsychotic drug [32]\n\n\nJeremy Bamber\nJeremy Nevill Bamber was born on 13 January 1961 to a student midwife who, after an affair with a married British Army sergeant, gave her baby to the Church of England Children's Society when he was six weeks old His biological parents later married and had other children; his father became a senior staff member in Buckingham Palace [42] The Bambers adopted Jeremy when he was six months old They sent him to St Nicholas Primary, then along with Sheila to Maldon Court prep school This was followed when he was aged 9, in September 1970, by Gresham's School, a boarding school in Holt, Norfolk, [43] where he joined the cadet force [44] Jeremy was apparently unhappy at Gresham's because of bullying and other factors [43]\n\n\nExtended family, inheritance\nThe financial ties and inheritance issues within the immediate and extended family provided a motive and added a layer of complexity to the case The Bambers' company, N. and J. Bamber Ltd, was worth £400,000 in 1985 (c. £1,061,016 in 2021) In their wills, June left £230,000 (c. £608,000) and Nevill £380,000 (c. £1,004,000) [10] [58] During the trial, the court heard that the Bambers had left their estate to both Jeremy and Sheila, to be divided equally In addition, Nevill's will had said that, to inherit, Jeremy had to be working on the farm at the time of his father's death The court also heard, from Mugford's mother, that he had been saying June wanted to change her will to bypass him and Sheila and leave her estate to Sheila's twins instead [59]\n\n\nJeremy's visit to the farm\nOn Sunday, 4 August 1985, three days before the murders, Sheila and the boys arrived at White House Farm to spend the week with Nevill and June The housekeeper saw Sheila that day and noticed nothing unusual Two farm workers saw her the following day with her children and said she seemed happy [66] One of the crime scene photographs showed that someone had carved \"I hate this place\" into the cupboard doors of the bedroom in which the twins were sleeping [67]\n\n\nAtmosphere in the house\nOn Sunday, 4 August 1985, three days before the murders, Sheila and the boys arrived at White House Farm to spend the week with Nevill and June The housekeeper saw Sheila that day and noticed nothing unusual Two farm workers saw her the following day with her children and said she seemed happy [66] One of the crime scene photographs showed that someone had carved \"I hate this place\" into the cupboard doors of the bedroom in which the twins were sleeping [67]\n\n\nMurder weapon\nJeremy told the court that, hours before the murders on 6 August, he had loaded the rifle, thinking he heard rabbits outside, but had not used it He left the rifle on the kitchen table, with a full magazine and a box of ammunition, before leaving the house [73] It did not at that point have the silencer or telescopic sight attached, he claimed Both had been on the rifle in late July, according to a nephew, but Jeremy said his father must have removed them [74] The prosecution disputed this, maintaining that the silencer was on the rifle when the family was murdered [75]\n\n\nPolice logs, 7 August 1985\nThere were three telephones at White House Farm on the night of the shooting, all on the same landline [81] There was usually a cream rotary phone in the main bedroom on Nevill's bedside table;

they passed him on Pages Lane and arrived at the farmhouse one or two minutes before him Jeremy's cousin, Ann Eaton, testified that he was normally a fast driver [100] [101] The group waited outside the house for a tactical firearms unit to arrive, which turned up at 5 am and decided to wait until daylight before trying to enter Police determined that all the doors and windows to the house were shut except for the window in the main bedroom on the first floor Using a loudhailer, they spent two hours trying to communicate with Sheila The only sound they reported from the house was a dog barking [100] [102]\n\n\nEvents outside\nAfter the telephone calls, Jeremy drove to the farmhouse, as did three officers from Witham police station who later testified that he had been driving much more slowly than them;

she was found in her nightdress with bare feet The police believe she had been sitting up during part of the attack, based on the pattern of blood on her clothing She was found lying on the floor by the door of the master bedroom June had been shot seven times One shot to her forehead, between her eyes, was fired from under one foot (30 cm) away That and another shot to the right side of her head would both have caused her death quickly, the court heard There were also shots to the right side of her lower neck and to her right forearm, and two injuries on the right side of her chest and right knee [111]\n\n\nDaniel and Nicholas\nThe boys were found in their beds in their own room (formerly Sheila's room) They appeared to have been shot while in bed The court heard that Daniel had been shot five times in the back of the head, four times with the gun held within one foot (30 cm) of his head, and once from over two feet (60 cm) away Nicholas had been shot three times, all contact or close-proximity shots [112]\n\n\nSheila\nSheila was found on the floor of the master bedroom with her mother She was in her nightdress, her feet were bare, and she had two bullet wounds under her chin, one of them on her throat The pathologist, Peter Vanezis, said that the lower of the injuries had occurred from three inches (76 mm) away and that the higher one was a contact injury The higher of the two would have killed her immediately The lower injury would have killed her too, he said, but not necessarily straight away Vanezis testified that it would be possible for a person with such an injury to stand up and walk around, but the lack of blood on her nightdress suggested to him that she had not done this He believed that the lower of her injuries had happened first because it had caused bleeding inside the neck; the court heard that if the immediately fatal wound had happened first, the bleeding would not have occurred to the same extent The pattern of bloodstains on her nightdress suggested she had been sitting up when she received both injuries, Vanezis said [113]\n\n\nPolice investigation\nThe police and media were initially convinced by the murder-suicide theory Detective Chief Inspector Thomas Jones, deputy head of CID, was so sure Sheila had killed her family that he ordered Jeremy's cousins out of his office when they asked him to consider whether Jeremy had set the whole thing up [97] [118] The Daily Express reported on 8 August 1985, the day after the murders:\n\n\nMurder-suicide theory, crime scene\nThe police and media were initially convinced by the murder-suicide theory Detective Chief Inspector Thomas Jones, deputy head of CID, was so sure Sheila had killed her family that he ordered Jeremy's cousins out of his office when they asked him to consider whether Jeremy had set the whole thing up [97] [118] The Daily Express reported on 8 August 1985, the day after the murders:\n\n\nFuneral, Bamber's behaviour\nThe inquest into the murders was opened on 14 August 1985 The police gave evidence that the killings constituted a murder–suicide, [97] and the bodies were released Nevill, June and Sheila were cremated; the boys were buried Jeremy's behaviour before and after the funeral increased suspicion among his family that he had been involved; they alleged that he sobbed during the funeral service for his parents and sister, and at one point seemed to buckle and had to be supported by Mugford, but that he was smiling and joking later at the wake [122]\n\n\nFingerprints on rifle\nA print from Sheila's right ring finger was found on the right side of the butt of the rifle, pointing downwards A print from Jeremy's right forefinger was on the rear end of the barrel, above the stock and pointing across the gun He said he had used the gun to shoot rabbits There were three other prints that could not be identified [126]\n\n\nSilencer\nThe silencer was not on the gun when the bodies were discovered It was found by one of Jeremy's cousins, three days after the murders, in the ground-floor office gun cupboard [127] Whether it was on the gun during the murders became a pivotal issue The prosecution maintained that the silencer had indeed been on the gun, and that this meant Sheila could not have shot herself Forensic tests indicated that her arms were not long enough to turn the gun on herself with the silencer attached [f] If she had shot the others with the silencer, then realized the gun was too long for her to shoot herself, the silencer would have been found next to her body; she had no reason to return it to the gun cupboard before going back upstairs to shoot herself If Sheila was not the killer, it meant Jeremy had lied about the telephone call from his father saying Sheila had \"gone berserk\" with the gun [129]\n\n\nScratch marks on mantelpiece\nJeremy's cousins returned to the farmhouse to search for the source of the red paint on the silencer In the kitchen they found marks in the red paint on the underside of the mantelpiece above an AGA cooker A sample taken by a scenes-of-crime officer was found to contain the same fifteen layers of paint and varnish that were in the paint flake found on the silencer Casts of the marks on the mantelpiece were deemed consistent with the silencer having come into contact with the mantel several times [133]\n\n\nJulie Mugford's statements\nOn 7 September 1985, a month after the murders, Mugford changed her statement to police, now alleging that Jeremy had been planning to kill his family As a result of her second statement, he was arrested the following day [134]\n\n\nBackground\nA campaign, known from November 2015 as JB Campaign Ltd, gathered pace over the years to secure Jeremy's release [204] The civil-liberties group Justice for All took up his case in 1993 to prepare for his appeal that year, and The Guardian ran a long investigative piece by Jim Shelley in November 1993 that included a telephone interview with Jeremy from HMP Long Martin, Worcestershire;

the prosecution later alleged that he had used this bicycle to cycle between his cottage and White House Farm on the night of the murders to avoid being seen in his car on the road Mugford told police that Jeremy had telephoned her at 9:50 pm on 6 August to say he had been thinking about the crime all day, was \"pissed off\", and that it was \"tonight or never\" A few hours later, at 3:00–3:30 am on 7 August, Mugford said he phoned her again to say: \"Everything is going well Something is wrong at the farm I haven't had any sleep all night .. bye honey and I love you lots.\" Her flatmates' evidence suggested that call had come through closer to 3:00 am Jeremy called later in the morning to tell Mugford that Sheila had gone mad and that a police car was coming to pick her up When she arrived with the police at Jeremy's cottage, she said he had pulled her to one side and said: \"I should have been an actor.\" [144] [146]\n\n\nLetter about Mugford\nA letter dated 26 September 1985 from the assistant director of public prosecutions who prepared the case against Jeremy suggests that Mugford not be prosecuted for the burglary, the cheque fraud, and a further offence of selling cannabis Mugford subsequently testified against Jeremy during his trial in October 1986 The judge told the jury that they could convict Jeremy on Mugford's testimony alone [147] [148] Immediately after the verdict was announced, Mugford sold her story to the News of the World for £25,000 (equivalent to £93,000 in 2,023) [149] [58]\n\n\nBamber's arrest\nAs a result of Mugford's statement, Jeremy was arrested on 8 September 1985, as was the friend Mugford said he had implicated, although the latter had a solid alibi and was released Jeremy told police Mugford was lying because he had jilted her He said he loved his parents and sister, and denied that they had kept him short of money; he claimed the only reason he had broken into the caravan site with Mugford was to prove that security was poor He further claimed he had occasionally gained entry to the farmhouse through a downstairs window and had used a knife to move the catches from the outside He also claimed he had seen his parents' wills, and that they had left the estate to be shared between him and Sheila As for the rifle, Jeremy told police the gun was used mostly with the silencer off because it would otherwise not fit in its case [134]\n\n\nTrial, October 1986\nJeremy's trial, which lasted eighteen days, opened on 3 October 1986 before Mr Justice Drake and a jury of seven men and five women at Chelmsford Crown Court [153] [18] The prosecution was led by Anthony Arlidge QC, and the defence by Geoffrey Rivlin QC, supported by Ed Lawson QC [97] The Times wrote that Jeremy cut an arrogant figure in the witness box At one point, when prosecutors accused him of lying, he replied: \"That is what you have got to establish.\" [4]\n\n\nProsecution case\nJeremy's trial, which lasted eighteen days, opened on 3 October 1986 before Mr Justice Drake and a jury of seven men and five women at Chelmsford Crown Court [153] [18] The prosecution was led by Anthony Arlidge QC, and the defence by Geoffrey Rivlin QC, supported by Ed Lawson QC [97] The Times wrote that Jeremy cut an arrogant figure in the witness box At one point, when prosecutors accused him of lying, he replied: \"That is what you have got to establish.\" [4]\n\n\nDefence case\nThe defence maintained that the witnesses who said Jeremy disliked his family were lying or had misinterpreted his words Mugford had lied about his confession, they said, because he had betrayed her No one had seen Jeremy cycle to and from the farm There were no marks on him on the night in question that suggested he had been in a fight No blood-stained clothing of his was recovered He had not driven to the farm as quickly as he could have after his father telephoned because he was afraid, they said There was no probative value in the finding of a hacksaw in the garden, because Jeremy had entered the house via the windows many times, before the killings and since [158]\n\n\nSumming up, verdict\nThe judge told the jury that there were three crucial points, in no particular order Did they believe Mugford or Jeremy? Were they sure that Sheila was not the killer who then committed suicide? He said this question involved another: was the second, fatal, shot fired at Sheila with the silencer on? If yes, she could not have fired it Finally, did Nevill call Jeremy in the middle of the night? If there was no such call, it undermined the entirety of Jeremy's story; the only reason he would have had to invent the phone call was that he was responsible for the murders [85]\n\n\nAppeals\nJeremy first sought leave to appeal in November 1986, arguing that the judge had misdirected the jury The application was heard and refused by Mr Justice Caulfield in April 1988 [162] During a full hearing in March 1989 before three Appeal Court judges—Lord Lane, the Lord Chief Justice; Mr Justice Roch; and Mr Justice Henry [163]—Jeremy's lawyer, Geoffrey Rivlin QC, argued that the trial judge's summing up had been biased against his client, that his language had been too forceful, and that he had undermined the defence by advancing his own theory Rivlin also argued that the defence had not pressed Mugford about her dealings with the media but should have, because as soon as the trial was over her story began to appear in newspapers [162] [164] On 20 March 1989 the judges refused Jeremy leave to appeal, ruling that there was nothing unsafe or unsatisfactory about the verdicts [163]\n\n\nLeave to appeal refused, 1989 and 1994\nJeremy first sought leave to appeal in November 1986, arguing that the judge had misdirected the jury The application was heard and refused by Mr Justice Caulfield in April 1988 [162] During a full hearing in March 1989 before

that there was nothing unsafe or unsatisfactory about the verdicts [163]\n\n\nCourt of Appeal, 2002\nIn 1997 the Home Office passed Jeremy's case to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which had just been established to review alleged miscarriages of justice In March 2001 the CCRC referred the case to the Court of Appeal because of the discovery of DNA inside the silencer; this was found as a result of a test not available in 1986 and constituted fresh evidence [170] [171] Jeremy's conviction rested in part on evidence that Sheila's blood had been found inside the silencer, suggesting that it had been on the gun when she died; but her arms were not long enough to point the gun back at herself and pull the trigger with the silencer attached [172] The appeal was heard from 17 October to 1 November 2002, at the Royal Courts of Justice, by Lord Justice Kay, Mr Justice Wright and Mr Justice Henriques, who published their decision on 12 December 2002 [2] The prosecution was represented by Victor Temple QC and Jeremy by Michael Turner QC [173] In a 522-paragraph judgment, the judges concluded that there was no conduct on the part of investigators that threatened the integrity of the trial, and that the more they examined the case, the more they thought the jury had been right [174] [175]\n\n\nCriminal Cases Review Commission referral\nIn 1997 the Home Office passed Jeremy's case to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which had just been established to review alleged miscarriages of justice In March 2001 the CCRC referred the case to the Court of

was no conduct on the part of investigators that threatened the integrity of the trial, and that the more they examined the case, the more they thought the jury had been right [174] [175]\n\n\nGrounds\nJeremy initially brought sixteen issues to the attention of the court [176] Two (grounds 14 and 15) related to the silencer and DNA testing; the rest were about failure to disclose evidence or the fabrication of evidence [177] The defence withdrew ground 11 (\"the proposed purchase of a Porsche by the appellant\") before the hearing [178] [179]\n\n\nNew silencer evidence\nAlthough all the grounds (except 11) were reviewed by the court, the CCRC referred the case to the Court of Appeal on the basis of ground 15, the discovery of DNA on the silencer, the result of a test not available in 1986 [195] The silencer evidence during the trial had come from John Hayward, a biologist in private practice, formerly of the FSS He had found a \"considerable amount of blood\" inside the silencer; he had stated that it was human blood and that the blood group was consistent with it having come from Sheila He said there was a \"remote possibility\" that it was a mixture of blood from Nevill and June [196]\n\n\nAgainst whole-life tariff\nIn 2008 Jeremy lost a High Court appeal before Mr Justice Tugendhat against his whole-life tariff [200] This was upheld by the Court of Appeal in 2009 [201] Jeremy and three other British whole-life prisoners appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, but the appeal was rejected in 2012 [202] Jeremy and two of the prisoners (one of them the serial killer Peter Moore) appealed that decision, and in 2013 the European Court's Grand Chamber ruled that keeping the prisoners in jail with no prospect of release or review may not have been compatible with Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment [203]\n\n\nCampaign\nA campaign, known from November 2015 as JB Campaign Ltd, gathered pace over the years to secure Jeremy's release [204] The civil-liberties group Justice for All took up his case in 1993 to prepare for his appeal that year, and The Guardian ran a long investigative piece by Jim Shelley in November 1993 that included a telephone interview with Jeremy from HMP Long Martin, Worcestershire; Jeremy said he still could not understand why he had been convicted [166] From March 2001 several websites were set up to discuss the evidence, and in 2002 Jeremy used one of the sites to offer a £1 million reward for evidence that would overturn his conviction [205] Campaign events included a supporter reading a letter from Jeremy to his parents at their graveside, and a \"Bamber bake-off\" featuring his mother's favourite recipes [206]\n\n\nBackground\nA campaign, known from November 2015 as JB Campaign Ltd, gathered pace over the years to secure Jeremy's release [204] The civil-liberties group Justice for All took up his case in 1993 to prepare for his appeal that year, and The Guardian ran a long investigative piece by Jim Shelley in November 1993 that included a telephone interview with Jeremy from HMP Long Martin, Worcestershire; Jeremy said he still could not understand why he had been convicted [166] From March 2001 several websites were set up to discuss the evidence, and in 2002 Jeremy used one of the sites to offer a £1 million reward for evidence that would overturn his conviction [205] Campaign events included a supporter reading a letter from Jeremy to his parents at their graveside, and a \"Bamber bake-off\" featuring his mother's favourite recipes [206]\n\n\nCampaign's arguments\nThe defence disputed the location of Sheila's body The police said they had found her upstairs with her mother According to early police logs, one officer reported seeing through a window what he thought was the body of a woman near the kitchen door, but he later radioed that it was a man [211] A retired police officer who worked on the case said in 2011 that the first police logs were simply mistaken in reporting that a woman's body had been found downstairs [212] Jeremy's lawyers argued that images of Sheila taken by a police photographer at around 9 am on 7 August 1985 showed that her blood was still wet According to the defence team, had she been killed before 3:30 am, as the prosecution said, the blood would have congealed by 9 am They argued that she was alive when Jeremy was standing outside the house with the police, shot herself in the kitchen just as the police entered, then ran up one of the staircases to the bedroom, where she shot herself again, this time fatally [213]\n\n\nLocation of Sheila's body, time of death\nThe defence disputed the location of Sheila's body The police said they had found her upstairs with her mother According to early police logs, one officer reported seeing through a window what he thought was the body of a woman near the kitchen door, but he later radioed that it was a man [211] A retired police officer who worked on the case said in 2011 that the first police logs were simply mistaken in reporting that a woman's body had been found downstairs [212] Jeremy's lawyers argued that images of Sheila taken by a police photographer at around 9 am on 7 August 1985 showed that her blood was still wet According to the defence team, had she been killed before 3:30 am, as the prosecution said, the blood would have congealed by 9 am They argued that she was alive when Jeremy was standing outside the house with the police, shot herself in the kitchen just as the police entered, then ran up one of the staircases to the bedroom, where she shot herself again, this time fatally [213]\n\n\nAlleged crime-scene damage\nThe defence argued that the first officers to enter the farmhouse had inadvertently disturbed the crime scene, then reconstructed it Crime-scene photographs not made available to the original defence show Sheila's right arm and hand in slightly different positions in relation to the gun, which is lying across her body The gun itself also appears to have moved Former Detective Chief Superintendent Mick Gradwell of Lancashire Constabulary, shown the photographs by The Guardian, said in 2011: \"The evidence shows, or portrays, Essex police having damaged the scene, and then having staged it again to make it look like it was originally And if that has happened, and that hasn't been disclosed, that is really, really serious.\" [214]\n\n\nArguments about the silencer\nThe contention that the gun had a silencer on it during the murders was central to the prosecution's case; Jeremy and his lawyers have sought since 1987 to discredit the silencer evidence With the silencer fitted, the gun was too long for Sheila to have turned it on herself According to the prosecution, paint on the silencer could be matched to fresh scratch marks on the kitchen mantelpiece, assumed to have been made during a fight for the gun That the silencer was found in the gun cupboard was important to the prosecution, because Sheila had no reason to return it to the cupboard before killing herself But that it was found by one of the cousins who inherited part of the estate—days after the police had searched the house—blighted the prosecution's case, although it was accepted by a majority of the jury [215] [g]\n\n\nArguments about scratch marks\nThe defence commissioned a report from Peter Sutherst, a British forensic photographic expert, who was asked in 2008 to examine negatives of the kitchen taken on the day of the murders and later In his report, dated 17 January 2010, Sutherst argued that the scratch marks in the red paintwork on the kitchen mantelpiece had been created after the crime-scene photographs had been taken The prosecution alleged that the marks had been made during the struggle in the kitchen between Bamber and his father, as the silencer, attached to the rifle, had scratched against the mantelpiece The prosecution said that paint chips identical to the paint on the mantelpiece had been found on or inside the silencer [220] [221] [222] Sutherst said the scratch marks appeared in photographs taken on 10 September 1985, 34 days after the murders, but were not visible in the original crime-scene photographs He also said he had failed to find in the photographs any chipped paint on the carpet below the mantelpiece, where it might have been expected to fall had the mantelpiece been scratched during a struggle [220] Sutherst was asked by the CCRC to examine a red spot on the carpet visible in photographs underneath the scratches on the mantelpiece He said the red spot matched a piece of nail varnish missing from one of Sheila's toes [223] Sutherst concluded that the scratch marks on the mantel had been created after the day of the murders [220]\n\n\nArguments about police logs\nPolice telephone logs had been entered as evidence during the trial, but had not been noticed by Jeremy's lawyers Jeremy's new defence team based their new CCRC submissions in part on these logs, particularly on the radio log that, they say, shows Nevill called police that night to say his daughter had \"gone berserk\" with one of his guns [93] A separate log of a police radio message shows there was an attempt to speak to someone inside the farmhouse that night, as police waited outside to enter, but there was no response Police say the officers simply made a mistake [224]\n\n\nArguments about Mugford letter\nJeremy's lawyers argued that the 26 September 1985 letter to Mugford from John Walker, assistant director of public prosecutions, raised the possibility that she had been persuaded to testify in the hope that charges against her would not be pursued In the letter, Walker had suggested to the Chief Constable of Essex Police, \"with considerable hesitation\", that Mugford not be prosecuted for drug offences, burglary and cheque fraud, offences to which she had confessed during her police interviews regarding Bamber [147] The defence team also highlighted that, as soon as the verdict was announced, Mugford sold her story to the News of the World for £25,000 (equivalent to £92,526 in 2023) [149]\n\n\nCriminal Cases Review Commission, 2004–2012\nIn 2004 Jeremy's defence team, which included Giovanni di Stefano, [209] applied unsuccessfully to have the CCRC refer the case back to the Court of Appeal [225] His lawyers made a fresh submission to the CCRC in 2009 [226] The CCRC provisionally rejected Jeremy's 2009 submission in February 2011 in an 89-page document It invited his lawyers to respond within three months, extended the deadline to allow them to study all 406 crime-scene photographs, [226] [227] and in September 2011 granted them an indefinite period in which to pursue an additional line of inquiry [228]\n\n\nIn popular media\nThe case became the subject of a television drama series, White House Farm, starring Freddie Fox as Bamber and Cressida Bonas as Sheila, broadcast in January 2020 on ITV in the UK and HBO Max in the United States [232] [233] In 2021, documentary maker Louis Theroux produced a four-part series for Sky Crime on the murders, titled The Bambers: Murder At The Farm [234] Theroux told the Radio Times that the series had to be extended from an initial three-episode format due to the complexities of the case, [235] and told Sky News that \"both scenarios have anomalies\" [234]\n\n\nSee also\nBooks and long-form journalism\n\n\nSources\nBooks

{"title": "Marvel_Studios", "content": "\nBackground\nDuring what is known as Marvel's \"Timely era\", Captain America was licensed out to Republic Pictures for a 1944 serial film only for the free advertising Timely failed to provide any drawing of Captain America with his shield or any further background, and Republic created a whole new background for the character and portrayed the character using a gun [11] From the late 1970s through the early 1990s, Marvel Comics Group and Marvel Entertainment Group (MEG) sold options to studios to produce films based on Marvel Comics characters One of Marvel's superheroes, Spider-Man, was optioned in the late 1970s, and rights reverted to Marvel without a film having been produced within the allocated time frame From 1986 to 1996, most of Marvel's major characters were optioned, including the Fantastic Four, X-Men, Daredevil, the Hulk, Silver Surfer, and Iron Man [12] Marvel's first big-screen adaptation of one of its properties was the 1986 film Howard the Duck, [13] which was a box-office flop [14] MEG was purchased by New World Entertainment in November 1986 [15] and moved to produce films based on the Marvel characters It released The Punisher (1989) before MEG was sold to Ronald Perelman's Andrews Group Two other films were produced: Captain America (1990) released in the United Kingdom on screens and direct to video in the United States, and The Fantastic Four (1994), not intended for release [16]\n\n\nHistory\nFollowing a deal between MEG and ToyBiz in 1993, Avi Arad of ToyBiz was named president and chief executive officer (CEO) of both the Marvel Films division and New World Family Filmworks, Inc., a New World Entertainment subsidiary New World was MEG's former parent corporation and later a fellow subsidiary of the Andrews Group [17] [18] Marvel Productions became New World Animation by 1993 as Marvel would start up Marvel Films, including Marvel Films Animation [17] [19] [20] Marvel Films Animation shared Tom Tataranowicz with New World Animation as head of development and production [21] New World Animation (The Incredible Hulk), Saban (X-Men: The Animated Series) and Marvel Films Animation (Spider-Man) each produced a Marvel series for television for the 1996–1997 season [22] [20] [23] By the end of 1993, Arad and 20th Century Fox struck a deal to make a film based on the X-Men [24] New World Animation and Marvel Films Animation were sold along with the rest of New World by the Andrews Group to News Corporation and Fox as announced in August 1996 As part of the deal, Marvel licensed the rights to Captain America, Daredevil, and Silver Surfer to be on Fox Kids Network and produced by Saban New World Animation continued producing a second season of The Incredible Hulk for UPN [22] [25]\n\n\nMarvel Films (1993–1996)\nFollowing a deal between MEG and ToyBiz in 1993, Avi Arad of ToyBiz was named president and chief executive officer (CEO) of both the Marvel Films division and New World Family Filmworks, Inc., a New World Entertainment subsidiary New World was MEG's former parent corporation and later a fellow subsidiary of the Andrews Group [17] [18] Marvel Productions became New World Animation by 1993 as Marvel would start up Marvel Films, including Marvel Films Animation [17] [19] [20] Marvel Films Animation shared Tom Tataranowicz with New World Animation as head of development and production [21] New World Animation (The Incredible Hulk), Saban (X-Men: The Animated Series) and Marvel Films Animation (Spider-Man) each produced a Marvel series for television for the 1996–1997 season [22] [20] [23] By the end of 1993, Arad and 20th Century Fox struck a deal to make a film based on the X-Men [24] New World Animation and Marvel Films Animation were sold along with the rest of New World by the Andrews Group to News Corporation and Fox as announced in August 1996 As part of the deal, Marvel licensed the rights to Captain America, Daredevil, and Silver Surfer to be on Fox Kids Network and produced by Saban New World Animation continued producing a second season of The Incredible Hulk for UPN [22] [25]\n\n\nFormation of Marvel Studios and licensing films (1996–2004)\nOn August 7, 1996, Marvel Studios was created by Marvel Filing with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission to raise money to finance the new corporation, Marvel, Isaac Perlmutter's Zib, Inc and Avi Arad sold ToyBiz stocks [12] [26] ToyBiz filed an offering of 7.5 million shares with a closing price of $20.125 at the time, making the offering worth approximately $150 million ToyBiz sought to sell 1 million shares [27] Jerry Calabrese, the president of Marvel Entertainment Group, and Avi Arad, head of Marvel Films and a director of ToyBiz, were assigned tandem control of Marvel Studios Under Calabrese and Arad, Marvel sought to control pre-production by commissioning scripts, hiring directors, and casting characters, providing the package to a major studio partner for filming and distribution Arad said of the goal for control, \"When you get into business with a big studio, they are developing a hundred or 500 projects; you get totally lost That isn't working for us We're just not going to do it anymore Period.\" [12] Marvel Studios arranged a seven-year development deal with 20th Century Fox to cover markets in the United States and internationally [28]\n\n\nTransition to film production (2004–2009)\nMaisel was hired in 2004 as president and chief operating officer of Marvel Studios as he had a plan for the studio to self-finance its films [40] [41] Marvel entered into a non-recourse debt structure with Merrill Lynch that was collateralized by certain film rights to a total of ten characters from Marvel's vast vault Marvel received $525 million to make a maximum of ten films based on the company's properties over eight years, according to the parameters of the original deal Those characters were Ant-Man, the Avengers, Black Panther, Captain America, Cloak & Dagger, Doctor Strange, Hawkeye, Nick Fury, Power Pack, and Shang-Chi [52] Ambac insured the films would succeed or they would pay the interest payment on the debt and get the film rights as collateral [44] Initially, Marvel Studios was in talks with Universal Pictures as a possible distributor, because Universal owned the film rights to both the Hulk and Namor during that time [53] [54] Negotiations dragged on, so the studio began talks with Paramount Pictures In the second quarter of 2005, Merrill attempted to back out of full financing of each film, demanding that Marvel finance one-third of the budget Marvel took back rights in five foreign territories from Paramount for pre-sell to meet that demand [41] In September 2005, Marvel announced the Merrill Lynch financing deal with Paramount was on as marketer and distributor Marvel Studios' parent company Marvel Enterprises, Inc then changed its name to Marvel Entertainment, Inc to reflect the change to self-production [52]\n\n\nDisney conglomerate subsidiary (since 2009)\nOn August 31, 2009, the Walt Disney Company announced that it had reached a deal to acquire Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion [69] The deal was completed on December 31, with Marvel Entertainment becoming a subsidiary of Disney [70] Both Marvel and Disney stated that the merger would not affect any pre-existing deals with other film studios for the time being, [71] although Disney said they would distribute future Marvel projects with their own studio once the deals expired [72] Maisel stepped down from the studio following the sale to Disney [73] In April 2010, rumors circulated that Marvel was looking to create $20–40 million films based on properties such as Doctor Strange, Ka-Zar, Luke Cage, Dazzler, and Power Pack [74] Feige responded by saying, while budgets are generally never discussed early in development, Marvel was considering films for all characters mentioned in the rumor, except Dazzler, whose rights were at Fox [75]\n\n\nAcquisition by Disney and immediate changes (2009–2015)\nOn August 31, 2009, the Walt Disney Company announced that it had reached a deal to acquire Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion [69] The deal was completed on December 31, with Marvel Entertainment becoming a subsidiary of Disney [70] Both Marvel and Disney stated that the merger would not affect any pre-existing deals with other film studios for the time being, [71] although Disney said they would distribute future Marvel projects with their own studio once the deals expired [72] Maisel

in the rumor, except Dazzler, whose rights were at Fox [75]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios subsidiary and expansion to television and animation (since 2015)\nIn August 2015, Marvel Studios was placed into Walt Disney Studios, with Feige reporting directly to Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan F Horn instead of Marvel Entertainment CEO Isaac Perlmutter Marvel Television and subsidiary Marvel Animation were left under Marvel Entertainment and Perlmutter's control [86] [87] As of April 2017, Marvel Studios was housed on the second floor of the Frank G Wells Building at the Disney studio lot [1] [2] Fast Company ranked Marvel Studios number eleven on its 2018 World's Most Innovative Companies list [88]\n\n\nMarvel Studios Animation\nIn June 2021, ahead of Marvel Studios' first solely produced animated series What If...?, executive vice president of film production Victoria Alonso noted that the studio was creating an \"animation branch and mini-studio\" to focus on more animated content beyond What If...? [97] Marvel Studios outsources the animation for its animated series to third-party animation studios, though executive Brad Winderbaum indicated Marvel would work with fellow Disney studios Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios \"under the right circumstances\" [98] In September 2021, Alonso was promoted to President of Physical, Post Production, VFX and Animation [99] In November 2021, Marvel Studios announced the animated series X-Men '97 (2024–present), a revival of X-Men: The Animated Series (1992–1997) that is set in that series' continuity [100] The animation branch of Marvel Studios and \"mini-studio\" is known as Marvel Studios Animation [7] By April 2022, Marvel Studios had taken over production of the preschool animated series Spidey and His Amazing Friends, starting from its second season; the first season was produced under the Marvel Entertainment banner [101] The \"Marvel Animation\" name and banner was used for the division's projects by May 2024 [96]\n\n\nFiring of Victoria Alonso and relationship with VFX workers\nIn March 2023, Alonso was fired from her role at Marvel Studios by a group including Disney Entertainment co-chairman Alan Bergman and Disney's human resources and legal departments for serving as a producer on the Amazon Studios film Argentina, 1985 (2022); this was a breach of a 2018 agreement between Alonso and Disney which stated employees would not work for a competing studio [102] [103] Alonso reportedly did not seek permission to work on the film, and was asked by Disney to stop working on the film, as well as not to promote or publicize it, with the situation \"deemed serious enough\" that Disney requested a new agreement be signed Despite this, Alonso continued to promote the film following its September 2022 premiere, and was consistently reminded of her agreement and breach of contract, ultimately leading to her firing [102] Alonso's lawyers refuted this claim, stating Disney was aware of, and agreed to, Alonso's work on Argentina, 1985, and that she was instead \"silenced [.. and] was terminated when she refused to do something she believed was reprehensible\"; [104] this incident was reported to be a disagreement with a Disney executive over the censoring of gay pride elements in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) to release the film in Kuwait and comply with its restrictive anti-LGBTQ laws [105] [106] A Disney spokesperson reiterated the notion that she was fired due to \"an indisputable breach of contract and a direct violation of company policy\" among other \"key factors\" [104] Disney and Alonso reached a multimillion-dollar compensation settlement in April [107]\n\n\nCharacter rights\nMarvel had licensed out the film rights to many of their characters to other studios in the 1990s, starting with the X-Men, [24] the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, and Daredevil, which were followed by Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Black Widow, Luke Cage, the Punisher, Blade, Ghost Rider, Man-Thing, Black Panther, Deadpool, and Prime, among others [45] [113]\n\n\nCorporate structure\nThe \"Marvel Studios Parliament\", otherwise known as \"The Parliament\", is the creative

\"flipbook\" production logo, created by Imaginary Forces [190] This logo was accompanied by music from the film's score, sound effects or a song, to lead into the beginning of the film This was the logo seen in front of all of the studio's films until 2013, when the logo was updated with the release of Thor: The Dark World, again created by Imaginary Forces Feige stated that since Marvel was now their own entity within the Walt Disney Company, it \"felt like the time to update it and have something that is more substantial as a standalone logo in front of our features\" instead of having it be accompanied by Marvel's studio or distribution partners' logos Feige added that they \"didn't want to re-invent the wheel  [with the new logo], but we wanted it to feel bigger, to feel more substantial, which is why it starts with the flip, but suddenly it's more dimensional as we go through the lettering and it reveals itself with the metallic sheen before settling into the white-on-red, well known Marvel logo, with the added flourish of the arrival and the announcement of the Studios at the bottom of the word Marvel.\" [191] Imaginary Forces used the same animation technique on the updated logo, as they did when they created the first version in 2002 They were given a few hundred comic books to select images from, and ultimately chose 120 that were \"universal and not specific to one character\" and created a narrative \"where each image spoke to the one before it and after.\" [190] The new logo appeared on all subsequent studio productions set within the Marvel Cinematic Universe through Captain America: Civil War With the addition of the new logo, Marvel Studios also added a fanfare to accompany the logo, composed by Brian Tyler, who wrote the scores to Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, and Avengers: Age of Ultron [191] It was featured on the films Thor: The Dark World, Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), and Guardians of the Galaxy

and television production company based in Burbank, California. Founded in 1993, the company is a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company and is responsible for producing the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films and television series.\n\n**Background**\n\nDuring the 1940s, Marvel's \"Timely era\", Captain America was licensed out to Republic Pictures for a 1944 serial film. However, Timely failed to provide any advertising, and Republic created a new background for the character, portraying him as a gun-wielding hero.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Marvel Comics Group and Marvel Entertainment Group (MEG) sold options to studios to produce films based on Marvel Comics characters. One of these options was for the character Spider-Man, which reverted back to Marvel without a film being produced. From 1986 to 1996, most of Marvel's major characters were optioned, including the Fantastic Four, X-Men, Daredevil, the Hulk, Silver Surfer, and Iron Man.\n\n**History**\n\nIn 1993, Marvel Entertainment Group (MEG) and ToyBiz formed a deal, and Avi Arad was named president and CEO of both Marvel Films and New World Family Filmworks, Inc.

In November 2021, Marvel Studios announced the animated series X-Men '97 (2024-present), a revival of X-Men: The Animated Series (1992-1997) that is set in that series' continuity.\n\n**Firing of Victoria Alonso and Relationship with VFX Workers**\n\nIn March 2023, Victoria Alonso was fired from her role at Marvel Studios by a group including Disney Entertainment co-chairman Alan Bergman and Disney's human resources and legal departments for serving as a producer on the Amazon Studios film Argentina, 1985 (2022).

Marvel's \"Timely era\", Captain America was licensed out to Republic Pictures for a 1944 serial film only for the free advertising Timely failed to provide any drawing of Captain America with his shield or any further background, and Republic created a whole new background for the character and portrayed the character using a gun [11] From the late 1970s through the early 1990s, Marvel Comics Group and Marvel Entertainment Group (MEG) sold options to studios to produce films based on Marvel Comics characters One of Marvel's superheroes, Spider-Man, was optioned in the late 1970s, and rights reverted to Marvel without a film having been produced within the allocated time frame From 1986 to 1996, most of Marvel's major characters were optioned, including the Fantastic Four, X-Men,

Kids Network and produced by Saban New World Animation continued producing a second season of The Incredible Hulk for UPN [22] [25]\n\n\nMarvel Films (1993–1996)\nFollowing a deal between MEG and ToyBiz in 1993, Avi Arad of ToyBiz was named president and chief executive officer (CEO) of both the Marvel Films division and New World Family Filmworks, Inc., a New World Entertainment subsidiary New World was MEG's former parent corporation and later a fellow subsidiary of the Andrews Group [17] [18] Marvel Productions became New World Animation by 1993 as Marvel would start up Marvel Films,

continued producing a second season of The Incredible Hulk for UPN [22] [25]\n\n\nFormation of Marvel Studios and licensing films (1996–2004)\nOn August 7, 1996, Marvel Studios was created by Marvel Filing with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission to raise money to finance the new corporation, Marvel, Isaac Perlmutter's Zib, Inc and Avi Arad sold ToyBiz stocks [12] [26] ToyBiz filed an offering of 7.5 million shares with a closing price of $20.125 at the time, making the offering worth approximately $150 million ToyBiz sought to sell 1 million shares [27] Jerry Calabrese, the president of Marvel Entertainment Group, and Avi Arad, head of Marvel Films and a director of ToyBiz, were assigned tandem control of Marvel Studios Under Calabrese and Arad, Marvel sought to control pre-production by commissioning scripts, hiring directors, and casting characters, providing the package to a major studio partner for filming and distribution Arad said of the goal for control, \"When you get into business with a big studio, they are developing a hundred or 500 projects; you get totally lost That isn't working for us We're just not going to do it anymore Period.\" [12] Marvel Studios arranged a seven-year development deal with 20th Century Fox to cover markets in the United States and internationally [28]\n\n\nTransition to film production (2004–2009)\nMaisel was hired in 2004 as president and chief operating officer of Marvel Studios as he had a plan for the studio to self-finance its films [40] [41] Marvel entered into a non-recourse debt structure with Merrill Lynch that was collateralized by certain film rights to a total of ten characters from Marvel's vast vault Marvel received $525 million to make a maximum of ten films based on the company's properties over eight years, according to the parameters of the original deal Those characters were Ant-Man, the Avengers, Black Panther, Captain America, Cloak & Dagger, Doctor Strange, Hawkeye, Nick Fury, Power Pack, and Shang-Chi [52] Ambac insured the films would succeed or they would pay the interest payment on the debt and get the film rights as collateral [44] Initially, Marvel Studios was in talks with Universal Pictures as a possible distributor, because Universal owned the film rights to both the Hulk and Namor during that time [53] [54] Negotiations dragged on, so the studio began talks with Paramount Pictures In the second quarter of 2005, Merrill attempted to back out of full financing of each film, demanding that Marvel finance one-third of the budget Marvel took back rights in five foreign territories from Paramount for pre-sell to meet that demand [41] In September 2005, Marvel announced the Merrill Lynch financing deal with Paramount was on as marketer and distributor Marvel Studios' parent company Marvel Enterprises, Inc then changed its name to Marvel Entertainment, Inc to reflect the change to self-production [52]\n\n\nDisney conglomerate subsidiary (since

Entertainment becoming a subsidiary of Disney [70] Both Marvel and Disney stated that the merger would not affect any pre-existing deals with other film studios for the time being, [71] although Disney said they would distribute future Marvel projects with their own studio once the deals expired [72] Maisel stepped down from the studio following the sale to Disney [73] In April 2010, rumors circulated that Marvel was looking to create $20–40 million films based on properties such as Doctor Strange, Ka-Zar, Luke Cage, Dazzler, and Power Pack [74] Feige responded by saying, while budgets are generally never discussed early in development, Marvel was considering films for all characters mentioned in the rumor, except Dazzler, whose rights were at Fox [75]\n\n\nAcquisition by Disney and immediate changes (2009–2015)\nOn August 31, 2009, the Walt Disney Company announced that it had reached a deal to acquire Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion [69] The deal was completed on December 31, with Marvel Entertainment becoming a subsidiary of Disney [70] Both Marvel and Disney stated that the merger would not affect any pre-existing deals with other film studios for the time being,

Innovative Companies list [88]\n\n\nMarvel Studios Animation\nIn June 2021, ahead of Marvel Studios' first solely produced animated series What If...?, executive vice president of film production Victoria Alonso noted that the studio was creating an \"animation branch and mini-studio\" to focus on more animated content beyond What If...? [97] Marvel Studios outsources the animation for its animated series to third-party animation studios, though executive Brad Winderbaum indicated Marvel would work with fellow Disney studios Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios \"under the right circumstances\" [98] In September 2021, Alonso was promoted to President of Physical, Post Production, VFX and Animation [99] In November 2021, Marvel Studios announced the animated series X-Men '97 (2024–present), a revival of X-Men: The Animated Series (1992–1997) that is set in that series' continuity [100] The animation branch of Marvel Studios and \"mini-studio\" is known as Marvel Studios Animation [7] By April 2022, Marvel Studios had taken over production of the preschool animated series Spidey and His Amazing Friends, starting from its second season; the first season was produced under the Marvel Entertainment banner [101] The \"Marvel Animation\" name and banner was used for the division's projects by May 2024 [96]\n\n\nFiring of Victoria Alonso and relationship with VFX workers\nIn March 2023, Alonso was fired from her role at Marvel Studios by a group including Disney Entertainment co-chairman Alan Bergman and Disney's human resources and legal departments for serving as a producer on the Amazon Studios film Argentina, 1985 (2022); this was a breach of a 2018 agreement between Alonso and Disney which stated employees would not work for a competing studio [102] [103] Alonso reportedly did not seek permission to work on the film, and was asked by Disney to stop working on the film, as well as not to promote or publicize it, with the situation \"deemed serious enough\" that Disney requested a new agreement be signed Despite this, Alonso continued to promote the film following its September 2022 premiere, and was consistently reminded of her agreement and breach of contract, ultimately leading to her firing [102] Alonso's lawyers refuted this claim, stating Disney was aware of, and agreed to, Alonso's work on Argentina, 1985, and that she was instead \"silenced [.. and] was terminated when she refused to do something she believed was reprehensible\"; [104] this incident was reported to be a disagreement with a Disney executive over the censoring of gay pride elements in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) to release the film in Kuwait and comply with its restrictive anti-LGBTQ laws [105] [106] A Disney spokesperson reiterated the notion that she was fired due to \"an indisputable breach of contract and a direct violation of company policy\" among other \"key factors\" [104] Disney and Alonso reached a multimillion-dollar compensation settlement in April [107]\n\n\nCharacter rights\nMarvel had licensed out the film rights to many of their characters to other studios in the 1990s, starting

logo seen in front of all of the studio's films until 2013, when the logo was updated with the release of Thor: The Dark World, again created by Imaginary Forces Feige stated that since Marvel was now their own entity within the Walt Disney Company, it \"felt like the time to update it and have something that is more substantial as a standalone logo in front of our features\" instead of having it be accompanied by Marvel's studio or distribution partners' logos Feige added that they \"didn't want to re-invent the wheel  [with the new logo], but we wanted it to feel bigger, to feel more substantial, which is why it starts with the flip, but suddenly it's more dimensional as we go through the lettering and it reveals itself with the metallic sheen before settling into the white-on-red, well known Marvel logo, with the added flourish of the arrival and the announcement of the Studios at the bottom of the word Marvel.\" [191] Imaginary Forces used the same animation technique on the updated logo, as they did when they created the first version in 2002 They were given a few hundred comic books to select images from, and ultimately chose 120 that were \"universal and not specific to one character\" and created a narrative \"where each image spoke to the one before it and after.\" [190] The new logo appeared on all subsequent studio productions set within the Marvel Cinematic Universe through Captain America: Civil War With the addition of the new logo, Marvel Studios also added a fanfare to accompany the logo, composed by Brian Tyler, who wrote the scores to Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, and Avengers: Age of Ultron [191] It was featured on the films Thor: The Dark World, Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), and Guardians of the Galaxy

It is regarded as one of the top national leagues in the world and is one of the most popular sports leagues in Italy.\n\n**History**\n\nSerie A, as it is structured today, began during the 1929–30 season. From 1898 to 1922, the competition was organised into regional groups. Due to ever-growing teams attending regional championships, the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) split the CCI (Italian Football Confederation) in 1921, which founded in Milan the Lega Nord (Northern Football League), ancestor of present-day Lega Serie A. When CCI teams rejoined the FIGC created two interregional divisions renaming Categories into Divisions and splitting FIGC sections into two north–south leagues. In 1926, due to internal crises and fascist pressures, the FIGC changed internal settings, adding southern teams to the national division, ultimately leading to the 1929–30 final settlement.\n\n**Format**\n\nFor most of Serie A's history, there were 16 or 18 clubs competing at the top level. Since 2004–05, however, there have been 20 clubs in total. One season (1947–48) was played with 21 teams for political reasons, following post-war tensions with Yugoslavia.

This was due to a combination of all seven Serie A teams progressing into the knockout stages in European competition, picking up extra coefficient points. Additionally, Atalanta won the Europa League Final and Fiorentina were losing finalists in the UEFA Europa Conference League. This continued a strong recent record where five of the six European club finals have featured at least one Serie A side over the past two seasons. As a result of this ranking, the top 5 clubs in Serie A qualify for the champions league in 2024.\n\n**Tiebreaking**\n\nIf after all 38 games, there are two teams tied on points for first place or for 17th, the last safety spot, the team that wins the scudetto or stays up at 17th is decided by a single-legged play-off game of 90 minutes and penalties (no extra time), to be held at a neutral venue, with the host team decided by the tiebreakers listed below. If at least three teams are tied for one of those spots, then the two teams to play in the match is decided by a mini table between the teams involved using the tiebreakers below. The deciding tie-breakers for any ties on all other positions are as follows:\n\n1. Goal difference\n2. Goals scored\n3. Head-to-head results\n4. Away goals scored\n5. Away goals conceded\n6. Most consecutive wins\n7. Most consecutive clean sheets\n8. Most consecutive draws\n9. Most consecutive losses\n10. Disciplinary points\n\n**Clubs**\n\nThe following 20 clubs are competing in the Serie A during the 2024–25 season.\n\n1. AC Milan\n2. Atalanta\n3. Bologna\n4. Cagliari\n5. Empoli\n6. Fiorentina\n7.

Currently, the two broadcasters in Italy are the satellite broadcaster Sky Italia and streaming platform DAZN for its own pay television networks; RAI is allowed to broadcast only highlights (in exclusive from 13:30 to 22:30 CET).

Unlike UEFA, Serie A at first did not cap the number of players in first team squad at 25, meaning the club could employ more foreigners by increasing the size of the squad. However, a cap of 25 (under-21 players were excluded) was introduced to 2015–16 season (in 2015–16 season, squad simply require 8 homegrown players but not require 4 of them from their own youth team). In the 2016–17 season, the FIGC sanctioned Sassuolo for fielding ineligible player, Antonino Ragusa. Although the club did not exceed the capacity of 21 players that were not from their own youth team (only Domenico Berardi was eligible as youth product of their own) as well as under 21 of age (born 1995 or after, of which four players were eligible) in their 24-men call-up, it was reported that on Lega Serie A side the squad list was not updated.\n\n**FIFA World Players of the Year**\n\nThe

competition, picking up extra coefficient points Additionally, Atalanta won the Europa League Final and Fiorentina were losing finalists in the UEFA Europa Conference League This continued a strong recent record where five of the six European club finals have featured at least one Serie A side over the past two seasons As a result of this ranking the top 5 clubs in Serie A qualify for the champions league in 2024.\n\n\nTiebreaking\nIf after all 38 games, there are two teams tied on points for first place or for 17th, the last safety spot, the team that wins the scudetto or stays up at 17th is decided by a single-legged play-off game of 90 minutes and penalties (no extra time), to be held at a neutral venue, with the host team decided by the tiebreakers listed below [32] [33] [34] If at least three teams are tied for one of those spots, then the two teams to play in the match is decided by a mini table between the teams involved using the tiebreakers below The deciding tie-breakers for any ties on all other positions are as follows:\n\n\nClubs\nThe following 20 clubs are competing in the Serie A during the 2024–25 season.\n\n\n2024–25 season\nThe following 20 clubs

(UEFA) Unlike UEFA, Serie A at first did not cap the number of players in first team squad at 25, meaning the club could employ more foreigners by increasing the size of the squad [66] However, a cap of 25 (under-21 players were excluded) was introduced to 2015–16 season (in 2015–16 season, squad simply require 8 homegrown players but not require 4 of them from their own youth team) [67] In the 2016–17 season, the FIGC sanctioned Sassuolo for fielding ineligible player, Antonino Ragusa [68] Although the club did not exceed the capacity of 21 players that were not from their own youth team (only Domenico Berardi was eligible as youth product of their own) as well as under 21 of age (born 1995 or after, of which four players were eligible) in their 24-men call-up, [69] It was reported

{"title": "Indonesia_national_football_team", "content": "\nHistory\nDutch East Indies, or Netherlands East Indies was the national team that represented the territory of present-day Indonesia during the Dutch colonial era The team was organized by the Dutch East Indies Football Union (NIVU), which became a member of FIFA on 24 May 1924 The first recorded unofficial match of the Dutch East Indies was against Singapore on 28 March 1921 in Batavia, which ended in a 1–0 win This was followed by matches in August 1928 against Australia (2–1 win) and in 1930 against a team from Shanghai, China (4–4 draw) [10]\n\n\n1921–1938: Colonization era\nDutch East Indies, or Netherlands East Indies was the national team that represented the territory of present-day Indonesia during the Dutch colonial era The team was organized by the Dutch East Indies Football Union (NIVU), which became a member of FIFA on 24 May 1924 The first recorded unofficial match of the Dutch East Indies was against Singapore on 28 March 1921 in Batavia, which ended in a 1–0 win This was followed by matches in August 1928 against Australia (2–1 win) and in 1930 against a team from Shanghai, China (4–4 draw) [10]\n\n\n1938–1945: Asia's first World Cup participant\nDutch East Indies made its World Cup debut during the 1938 edition in France The team advanced to the final round without playing any qualifying matches Japan, who were drawn in Group 12 of the qualifying round with the Dutch East Indies, decided to withdraw from the competition The Dutch East Indies were then ordered by FIFA to carry out a play-off match against one of the Group 11 participants, the United States The match was scheduled to be played on 29 May 1938, but never took place after the United States also decided to withdraw from the competition This allowed the Dutch East Indies to advance to the final round as the Asia's first World Cup participant [16] [17]\n\n\n1945–1984: Independence era\nAfter the Second World War, followed by the Indonesian Revolution in 1947, the national team no longer used the name Dutch East Indies and replacing it with the name Indonesia The previous national football organization, the Dutch East Indies Football Union (NIVU) was succeeded by the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI) The team's first official match under the name Indonesia was on 5 March 1951 at the Asian Games, where they lost 0–3 by the host nation India at the National Stadium, New Delhi [19]\n\n\n1985–1995: Renaissance of Indonesia football\nThe 1986 FIFA World Cup qualification round saw Indonesia advance from the first round with four wins, one draw, and one loss, eventually finishing at the top of its group South Korea emerged victorious over Indonesia in the second round [10] The team reached the semi-final of the 1986 Asian Games after beating the United Arab Emirates in the quarter-finals Indonesia then lost to host South Korea in the semi-finals and lost to Kuwait in the bronze medal match [20]\n\n\n1995–2016: Continental appearances\nIndonesia's first appearance in the AFC Asian Cup was against United Arab Emirates in the 1996 AFC Asian Cup During the tournament, Indonesia only scored a single point from a 2–2 draw against Kuwait in the first round [21]\n\n\n1996 AFC Asian Cup\nIndonesia's first appearance in the AFC Asian Cup was against United Arab Emirates in the 1996 AFC Asian Cup During the tournament, Indonesia only scored a single point from a 2–2 draw against Kuwait in the first round [21]\n\n\n1998 Tiger Cup\nIn the final group stage match of the 1998 Tiger Cup, Indonesia faced Thailand while the both teams already through to the semi-finals, but were also aware that the winner would have to face hosts Vietnam Indonesia's Mursyid Effendi deliberately kicked the ball into Indonesia's own goal as Thailand's attacker ran towards the ball [22] FIFA fined both teams $40,000 for \"violating the spirit of the game\" while Effendi was banned from international association football for a lifetime Indonesia was rewarded with a match by the team they wanted to face; minnows Singapore (who they ironically lost 2–1 to) in the semi-finals [23]\n\n\n2000 AFC Asian Cup\nThe team's second appearance in the Asian Cup was in Lebanon in the 2000 AFC Asian Cup; again, the Indonesian team gained only one point from three games, and again, from a match against Kuwait that finished without a score from either side Indonesia established a higher record in the 2004 AFC Asian Cup, beating Qatar 2–1 to record the team's first-ever victory in the history of the tournament The win was not enough for it to qualify for the second round, having fallen 0–5 to host China and 1–3 to Bahrain.\n\n\n2004 AFC Asian Cup\nIndonesia then qualified for their third successful tournament in the 2004 AFC Asian Cup being grouped with China, Qatar, and Bahrain with them winning the only match against Qatar in a 2–1 victory but crashed out of the tournament with only three points.\n\n\n2007 AFC Asian Cup\nThe 2007 AFC Asian Cup saw Indonesia co-hosting the tournament with Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam becoming the first time in the AFC Asian Cup history that four countries co-hosted the competition In the opening match of the tournament, Indonesia faces Bahrain with goals coming from Budi Sudarsono and Bambang Pamungkas to secure a 2–1 win However, in the following two matches, Indonesia suffered a 2–1 defeat to Saudi Arabia and narrowly losing to South Korea 1–0 which Indonesia failed to qualified to the knockout stage of the tournament.\n\n\nAFF Championship\nIndonesia reached the finals of AFF Championship on six occasions (2000, 2002, 2004, 2010, 2016, and 2020), albeit never managing to lift the trophy victoriously The team's claim of regional titles came in the Southeast Asian Games of 1987 and 1991 [24] [25]\n\n\n2012–2016: Suspensions\nIn March 2012, PSSI received a warning for the divided state of Indonesian football, whereby two separate leagues existed: the rebel Indonesia Super League (ISL), which isn't recognized by PSSI or FIFA, and the Indonesia Premier League (IPL) The National Sports Committee (KONI) encouraged PSSI to work collaboratively with Indonesian Football Savior Committee (KPSI) officials to rectify the situation but KONI chairman Tono Suratman stated in March 2012 that KONI would take over the beleaguered PSSI if matters are not improved [28] FIFA did not state whether Indonesia would face suspension, but on 20 March 2012, FIFA made an announcement In the lead-up to 20 March 2012, PSSI struggled to resolve the situation and looked to its annual congress for a final solution [29] PSSI was given until 15 June 2012 to settle the issues at stake, notably the control of the breakaway league; failing this, the case was to be referred to the FIFA Emergency Committee for suspension [30] FIFA eventually set a new 1 December 2012 deadline In the two weeks preceding the deadline, three out of four PSSI representatives withdrew from the joint committee, citing frustrations in dealing with KPSI representatives However, FIFA stated that it would only issue a punishment to Indonesian football after the Indonesian national squad finished its involvement in the 2012 AFF Championship [31]\n\n\n2017–2019: Rebuilding\nSome weeks after finishing as runners-up in the 2016 AFF Championship, PSSI held a congress on 8 January 2017 in an effort to sign Spanish coach, Luis Milla to handle their senior and U-22 team Prior to the 2018 AFF Championship, Milla departed without any explanation, causing anger among Indonesian supporters [39] Indonesia crashed out from the group stage in the 2018 AFF Championship,which led to the sacking of Bima Sakti [40] In order to prepare for the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign, Indonesia signed Scottish coach Simon McMenemy with hope that his successful tenure with the Philippines could reinvigorate Indonesia's performance especially when Indonesia was grouped with three Southeast Asian rivals Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam alongside UAE [41] Indonesia lost all four matches including a 2–3 home defeat to Malaysia despite having taken a 2–1 lead prior followed by a home loss to Vietnam for the first time in any competitive tournaments [42] [43] On 6 November 2019, PSSI decided to sack McMenemy over the national team's deteriorating performance [44] Indonesia traveled to Malaysia and lost 0–2 to its rival and was officially eliminated from the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification [45]\n\n\n2020–present: Shin Tae-yong era\nAfter failing to qualify for the World Cup, PSSI appointed Shin Tae-yong as the head coach of the Indonesian national team, becoming the first South Korean in Indonesia's managerial history This appointment was based on the success of fellow Korean coach Park Hang-seo in Vietnam Shin was then tasked with immediately forming a team to compete in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification round [46] [47]\n\n\n2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification\nIn the 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification, Indonesia defeated host and former Asian champions, Kuwait, whom they had not defeated in 42 years, 2–1, to the surprise of many people, the first official win by a Southeast Asian team against a West Asian host since 2004 (when Thailand beat Yemen 3–0 in Sana'a during the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification), and was the first time in the history that a Southeast Asian team had won against a Persian Gulf team as the visitor In the final match, Indonesia massively beat Nepal 7–0 at the Jaber Al-Ahmad International Stadium Boosted by the win, Indonesia qualified for the upcoming 2023 AFC Asian Cup after a 16-year absence Indonesia would be drawn with the top AFC rank team, Japan, Iraq, and Southeast Asia rival, Vietnam.\n\n\n2026 FIFA World Cup qualification\nOn 19 June 2023, Indonesia hosted 2022 FIFA World Cup champions, Argentina in preparation for the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification Indonesia massively played well holding the world's champion but a long strike from Leandro Paredes settled a 1–0 win right before halftime In the second half, Cristian Romero scored a header to level it up to 2–0 for the Argentines.\n\n\n2023 AFC Asian Cup\nIndonesia then started off 2024 playing two friendly matches against Libya at the Mardan Sports Complex in Turkey before flying off to Qatar for the last friendly match against Iran as the final preparation for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup tournament.\n\n\nAdvanced to the third round of World Cup qualification\nAt the continuation of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification, Indonesia managed to beat Vietnam again twice on 21 & 26 March, in a 1–0 on Jakarta and 3–0 on Hanoi victories respectively, the latter would be the first time since 2004 that Indonesia defeated Vietnam in their own home ground Thus Indonesia climbed up to the second place of the group with 7 points The two victories also made Indonesia surpass ASEAN rivals, Philippines and Malaysia in the FIFA ranking, the latter would be the first time Indonesia placed above Malaysia in the FIFA ranking in 5 years [50] [51]\n\n\nTeam image\nDuring the Dutch colonial era, the team competed as Dutch East Indies in international matches and played in an orange jersey, the national color of the Netherlands There are no official documents about the team's kit, only several black-and-white photos from the match against Hungary in the 1938 FIFA World Cup; but unofficial documents stated that the kit consisted of an orange jersey, white shorts and light blue socks [54]\nSince Indonesia's independence, the kit consists of red and white, the colors of the country's flag A combination of green and white has also been used for the away kits and was

football field The infamous \"Ganyang Malaysia!\" statement put forward by Indonesia's first president Sukarno in a 1963 political speech in Jakarta was considered an encouragement for the Indonesian

PSSI only.\n\n\nHome stadium\nDuring Indonesia's early days as the Dutch East Indies, there was no stadium that could be recognized as a home ground since the national team never played home games in the country The national team at that time played four games at neutral venues and one away game [10] It was only after independence in 1945, the national team used the Ikada Stadium in Jakarta as their home ground [14] The stadium had a capacity of 30,000 spectators and was also used for the National Sports Week in 1951 It was the largest stadium in Jakarta until 1962 The team used the stadium

The team was organized by the Dutch East Indies Football Union (NIVU), which became a member of FIFA on 24 May 1924. The first recorded unofficial match of the Dutch East Indies was against Singapore on 28 March 1921 in Batavia, which ended in a 1–0 win. This was followed by matches in August 1928 against Australia (2–1 win) and in 1930 against a team from Shanghai, China (4–4 draw).\n\n### Colonization era\n\nThe Dutch East Indies played its first official international match in 1924, losing 1–0 to the Philippines. The team played a total of 14 matches during this period, winning 4, drawing 2, and losing 8. The team's first major tournament appearance was in the 1938 FIFA World Cup, where they advanced to the final round without playing any qualifying matches. However, they were eliminated in the final round after losing to Hungary and Sweden.\n\n### Asia's first World Cup participant\n\nThe Dutch East Indies made its World Cup debut during the 1938 edition in France. The team advanced to the final round without playing any qualifying matches. Japan, who were drawn in Group 12 of the qualifying round with the Dutch East Indies, decided to withdraw from the competition. The Dutch East Indies were then ordered by FIFA to carry out a play-off match against one of the Group 11 participants, the United States. The match was scheduled to be played on 29 May 1938, but never took place after the United States also decided to withdraw from the competition. This allowed the Dutch East Indies to advance to the final round as Asia's first World Cup participant.\n\n### Independence era\n\nAfter the Second World War, followed by the Indonesian Revolution in 1947, the national team no longer used the name Dutch East Indies and replacing it with the name Indonesia. The previous national football organization, the Dutch East Indies Football Union (NIVU) was succeeded by the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI). The team's first official match under the name Indonesia was on 5 March 1951 at the Asian Games, where they lost 0–3 by the host nation India at the National Stadium, New Delhi.\n\n## 1985-1995: Renaissance of Indonesia football\n\nThe 1986 FIFA World Cup qualification round saw Indonesia advance from the first round with four wins, one draw, and one loss, eventually finishing at the top of its group. South Korea emerged victorious over Indonesia in the second round. The team reached the semi-final of the 1986 Asian Games after beating the United Arab Emirates in the quarter-finals. Indonesia then lost to host South Korea in the semi-finals and lost to Kuwait in the bronze medal match.\n\n## 1995-2016: Continental appearances\n\nIndonesia's first appearance in the AFC Asian Cup was against United Arab Emirates in the 1996 AFC Asian Cup. During the tournament, Indonesia only scored a single point from a 2–2 draw against Kuwait in the first round. In the final group stage match of the 1998 Tiger Cup, Indonesia faced Thailand while the both teams already through to the semi-finals, but were also aware that the winner would have to face hosts Vietnam. Indonesia's Mursyid Effendi deliberately kicked the ball into Indonesia's own goal as Thailand's attacker ran towards the ball. FIFA fined both teams $40,000 for \"violating the spirit of the game\" while Effendi was banned from international association football for a lifetime. Indonesia was rewarded with a match by the team they wanted to face; minnows Singapore (who they ironically lost 2–1 to) in the semi-finals.\n\n## 2000-2016: Continued participation in continental competitions\n\nThe team's second appearance in the Asian Cup was in Lebanon in the 2000 AFC Asian Cup; again, the Indonesian team gained only one point from three games, and again, from a match against Kuwait that finished without a score from either side. Indonesia established a higher record in the 2004 AFC Asian Cup, beating Qatar 2–1 to record the team's first-ever victory in the history of the tournament. The win was not enough for it to qualify for the second round, having fallen 0–5 to host China and 1–3 to Bahrain.\n\n## 2007-2016: Co-hosting the AFC Asian Cup\n\nThe 2007 AFC Asian Cup saw Indonesia co-hosting the tournament with Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam becoming the first time in the AFC Asian Cup history that four countries co-hosted the competition. In the opening match of the tournament, Indonesia faced Bahrain with goals coming from Budi Sudarsono and Bambang Pamungkas to secure a 2–1 win. However, in the following two matches, Indonesia suffered a 2–1 defeat to Saudi Arabia and narrowly losing to South Korea 1–0 which Indonesia failed to qualified to the knockout stage of the tournament.\n\n## 2012-2016: Suspensions\n\nIn March 2012, PSSI received a warning for the divided state of Indonesian football, whereby two separate leagues existed: the rebel Indonesia Super League (ISL), which isn't recognized by PSSI or FIFA, and the Indonesia Premier League (IPL). FIFA did not state whether Indonesia would face suspension, but on 20 March 2012, FIFA made an announcement that they would only issue a punishment to Indonesian football after the Indonesian national squad finished its involvement in the 2012 AFF Championship.\n\n## 2017-2019: Rebuilding\n\nSome weeks after finishing as runners-up in the 2016 AFF Championship, PSSI held a congress on 8 January 2017 in an effort to sign Spanish coach, Luis Milla to handle their senior and U-22 team. Prior to the 2018 AFF Championship, Milla departed without any explanation, causing anger among Indonesian supporters. Indonesia crashed out from the group stage in the 2018 AFF Championship, which led to the sacking of Bima Sakti. In order to prepare for the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign, Indonesia signed Scottish coach Simon McMenemy with hope that his successful tenure with the Philippines could reinvigorate Indonesia's performance.\n\n## 2020-present: Shin Tae-yong era\n\nAfter failing to qualify for the World Cup, PSSI appointed Shin Tae-yong as the head coach of the Indonesian national team, becoming the first South Korean in Indonesia's managerial history. This appointment was based on the success of fellow Korean coach Park Hang-seo in Vietnam. Shin was then tasked with immediately forming a team to compete in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification round.\n\n## 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification\n\nIn the 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification, Indonesia defeated host and former Asian champions, Kuwait, whom they had not defeated in 42 years, 2–1, to the surprise of many people. This was the first official win by a Southeast Asian team against a West Asian host since 2004 (when Thailand beat Yemen 3–0 in Sana'a during the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification). Indonesia was then drawn with the top AFC rank team, Japan, Iraq, and Southeast Asia rival, Vietnam.\n\n## 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification\n\nOn 19 June 2023, Indonesia hosted 2022 FIFA World Cup champions, Argentina in preparation for the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification. Indonesia played well, holding the world's champion, but a long strike from Leandro Paredes settled a 1–0 win right before halftime. In the second half, Cristian Romero scored a header to level it up to 2–0 for the Argentines.\n\n## Current squad\n\nThe following players have also been called up to the squad within the last 12

team's claim of regional titles came in the Southeast Asian Games of 1987 and 1991 [24] [25]\n\n\n2012–2016: Suspensions\nIn March 2012, PSSI received a warning for the divided state of Indonesian football, whereby two separate leagues existed: the rebel Indonesia Super League (ISL), which isn't recognized by PSSI or FIFA, and the Indonesia Premier League (IPL) The National Sports Committee (KONI) encouraged PSSI to work collaboratively with Indonesian Football Savior Committee (KPSI) officials to rectify the situation but KONI chairman Tono Suratman stated in March 2012 that KONI would take over the beleaguered PSSI if matters are not improved [28] FIFA did not state whether Indonesia would face suspension, but on 20 March 2012, FIFA made an announcement In the lead-up to 20 March 2012, PSSI struggled to resolve the situation and looked to its annual congress for a final solution [29] PSSI was given until 15 June 2012 to settle the issues at stake, notably the control of the breakaway league; failing this, the case was to be referred to the FIFA Emergency Committee for suspension [30] FIFA eventually set a new 1 December 2012 deadline In the two weeks preceding the deadline, three out of four PSSI representatives withdrew from the joint committee, citing frustrations in dealing with KPSI representatives However, FIFA stated that it would only issue a punishment to Indonesian football after the Indonesian national squad finished its involvement in the 2012 AFF Championship [31]\n\n\n2017–2019: Rebuilding\nSome weeks after finishing as runners-up in the 2016 AFF Championship, PSSI held a congress on 8 January 2017 in an effort to sign Spanish coach, Luis Milla to handle their senior and U-22 team Prior to the 2018 AFF Championship, Milla departed without any explanation, causing anger among Indonesian supporters [39] Indonesia crashed out from the group stage in the 2018 AFF Championship,which led to the sacking of Bima Sakti [40] In order to prepare for the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign, Indonesia signed Scottish coach Simon McMenemy with hope that his successful tenure with the Philippines could reinvigorate Indonesia's performance especially when Indonesia was grouped with three Southeast Asian rivals Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam alongside UAE [41] Indonesia lost all four matches including a 2–3 home defeat to Malaysia despite having taken a 2–1 lead prior followed by a home loss to Vietnam for the first time in any competitive tournaments [42] [43] On 6 November 2019, PSSI decided to sack McMenemy over the national team's deteriorating performance [44] Indonesia traveled to Malaysia and lost 0–2 to its rival and was officially eliminated from the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification [45]\n\n\n2020–present: Shin Tae-yong era\nAfter failing to qualify for the World Cup, PSSI appointed Shin Tae-yong as the head coach of the Indonesian national team, becoming the first South Korean in Indonesia's managerial history This appointment was based on the success of fellow Korean coach Park Hang-seo in Vietnam Shin was then tasked with immediately forming a team to compete in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification round [46] [47]\n\n\n2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification\nIn the 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification, Indonesia defeated host and former Asian champions, Kuwait, whom they had not defeated in 42 years, 2–1, to the surprise of many people, the first official win by a Southeast Asian team against a West Asian host since 2004 (when Thailand beat Yemen 3–0 in Sana'a during the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification), and was the first time in the history that a Southeast Asian team had won against a Persian Gulf team as the visitor In the final match, Indonesia massively beat Nepal 7–0 at the Jaber Al-Ahmad International Stadium Boosted by the win, Indonesia qualified for the upcoming 2023 AFC Asian Cup after a 16-year absence Indonesia would be drawn with the top AFC rank team, Japan,

before flying off to Qatar for the last friendly match against Iran as the final preparation for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup tournament.\n\n\nAdvanced to the third round of World Cup qualification\nAt the continuation of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification, Indonesia managed to beat Vietnam again twice on 21 & 26 March, in a 1–0 on Jakarta and 3–0 on Hanoi victories respectively, the latter would be the first time since 2004 that Indonesia defeated Vietnam in their own home ground Thus Indonesia climbed up to the second place of the group with 7 points The two victories also made Indonesia surpass ASEAN rivals, Philippines and Malaysia in the FIFA ranking, the latter would be the first time Indonesia placed above Malaysia in the FIFA ranking in 5 years [50] [51]\n\n\nTeam image\nDuring

PSSI only.\n\n\nHome stadium\nDuring Indonesia's early days as the Dutch East Indies, there was no stadium that could be recognized as a home ground since the national team never played home games in the country The national team at that time played four games at neutral venues and one away game [10] It was only after independence in 1945, the national team used the Ikada Stadium in Jakarta as their home ground [14] The stadium had a capacity of 30,000 spectators and was also used for the National Sports Week in 1951 It was the largest stadium in Jakarta until 1962 The team used the stadium

{"title": "Death_of_Caylee_Anthony", "content": "\nDisappearance\nOn June 16, 2008, Casey Anthony departed from her parents' home in Orlando, Florida, where she and Caylee resided [25] Her father, George Anthony, later testified that he saw his granddaughter Caylee leaving with Casey [26] Casey told her mother, Cindy, that she was taking Caylee to her nanny, whom Casey identified as Zenaida \"Zanny\" Fernandez-Gonzalez, and, the next day, she further informed Cindy that the three were headed to Tampa on a work trip [27]\n\n\nInvestigation\nCasey told investigators that she had left Caylee at the apartment of her nanny, Fernandez-Gonzalez, [26] and that Fernandez-Gonzalez had kidnapped the toddler [27] [32] But when police investigated the apartment, they found it had been abandoned for more than 140 days [26] Casey also told police that she was working at Universal Studios [33] However, when investigators took her to Universal Studios on July 16 and asked her to show them her office, Casey led detectives into the building before admitting that she no longer worked there; [34] as it turned out, she had not worked there since she had taken maternity leave almost three years earlier [35] Casey was subsequently arrested [36] On July 29, Casey was offered a limited-immunity deal—in exchange for help finding Caylee, prosecutors said they would not use Casey's statements to police against her [37] The offer expired September 2, 2008 [37]\n\n\nCriminal action\nFollowing her arrest at Universal Studios, [36] Casey was charged with giving false statements to law enforcement, child neglect and obstruction of a criminal investigation The judge denied bail, saying Casey had shown \"woeful disregard for the welfare of her child\" [47] On July 22, 2008, after a bond hearing, the judge set bail at $500,000 [48] A month later, Casey was released from the Orange County jail after her $500,000 bond was posted by Tony Padilla, the nephew of California bail bondsman Leonard Padilla [49] [50] Leonard said he hoped he and his nephew could help Anthony find her missing daughter [51] However, when an angry crowd began to gather around the Anthony residence, where Casey stayed while on bond, Tony decided to revoke her bond and returned her to jail [51] Leonard further added that Casey had not wanted to communicate with him [51]\n\n\nArrest\nFollowing her

daughter [51] However, when an angry crowd began to gather around the Anthony residence, where Casey stayed while on bond, Tony decided to revoke her bond and returned her to jail [51] Leonard further added that Casey had not wanted to communicate with him [51]\n\n\nIndictment\nOn October 14, 2008, Casey was indicted by a grand jury on charges of first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter of a child, and four counts of providing false information to police She was later arrested, [55] [56] and Judge John Jordan ordered that she be held without bond [57] A week later, the state dropped the child-neglect charges because \"the neglect charges were premised on the theory that  [Anthony]    was still alive\" [58] On October 28, Casey was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to all charges [59] On April 13, 2009, prosecutors announced that they planned to seek the death penalty in the case [60]\n\n\nTrial\nThe lead prosecutor in the case was Assistant State Attorney Linda Drane Burdick Assistant State Attorneys Frank George and Jeff Ashton completed the prosecution team [61] Lead counsel for the defense was Jose Baez, a Florida criminal defense attorney Attorneys J Cheney Mason, Dorothy Clay Sims and Ann Finnell served as co-counsel [62] During the trial, attorney Mark Lippman represented George and Cindy [63]\n\n\nAttorneys and jury\nThe lead prosecutor in the case was Assistant State Attorney Linda Drane Burdick Assistant State Attorneys Frank George and Jeff Ashton completed the prosecution team [61] Lead counsel for the defense was Jose Baez, a Florida criminal defense attorney Attorneys J Cheney Mason, Dorothy Clay Sims and Ann Finnell served as co-counsel [62] During the trial, attorney Mark Lippman represented George and Cindy [63]\n\n\nOpening statements\nThe trial began on May 24, 2011, at the Orange County Courthouse, with Judge Belvin Perry presiding In the opening statements, lead prosecutor Burdick described the story of Caylee's disappearance day-by-day [67] Prosecutors stated that Casey used chloroform to incapacitate Caylee before suffocating her with duct tape, leaving the body in the trunk of her car before disposing of it [7]: 1588  The defense, led by Baez, said Anthony had likely accidentally drowned in the family's pool on June 16, 2008, and that George had, with Casey's knowledge, covered up the drowning in order to spare his daughter a potential child-neglect charge [67] The defense further said that Casey's seemingly unaffected behavior after Caylee's death was attributable to child abuse she had allegedly suffered [67] at the hands of her father and brother [7]: 1588  [67] Finally, the defense stated that the police investigation had been compromised by the media frenzy [68]\n\n\nEvidence\nIn the trial's second week, the prosecution called various members of Casey's family to the stand [7]: 1588–89  George was their first witness, and, in a response to their questioning, he denied having sexually abused his daughter [69] Both George and Casey's then-boyfriend testified they did not smell anything resembling human decomposition in Casey's car when she visited them while Caylee was missing, [70] but George said he did smell something similar to human decomposition when he went to pick up the car on July 15 [71] Cindy testified that her comment to 9-1-1 that Casey's car smelled \"like someone died\" was just a figure of speech, [72] further noting that she had made \"exaggerated\" claims on the phone in an effort to get the police to respond quickly [73]\n\n\nClosing arguments\nClosing arguments were heard July 3 and July 4 [91] Ashton, for the prosecution, reiterated the state's belief that Casey had killed Caylee to free herself of parental duties, saying, \"When you have a child, that child becomes your life This case is about the clash between that responsibility, and the expectations that go with it, and the life that Casey Anthony wanted to have.\" [92] He emphasized Casey's false claims (including her claims regarding Fernandez-Gonzalez), the smell in the car and the items found with Caylee's remains [9] Ashton called the defense's theory of an accidental drowning \"absurd\" because, he said, no one would make an accident look like a murder [93]\n\n\nVerdict and sentence\nThe jury began deliberations on July 4 [98] On July 5, prosecutors stated that, during deliberations, they were about to give the jury the corrected information with regard to Bradley's software discrepancy; however, the jury reached a verdict before they could do so One legal analyst stated that if the jury had found Casey guilty before receiving the exculpatory evidence, the prosecution's failure to fully disclose it could have been grounds for a mistrial [99]\n\n\nAppeal\nCasey appealed her convictions, arguing that the false statements she provided to officers constituted one offense [107] and that the statements were inadmissible because she had not been given a Miranda warning [18] The prosecution said that each statement constituted a separate offense and that Casey was not detained at the time she made any of the statements [18]\n\n\nMedia coverage\nThe case attracted significant media attention The trial was commonly compared to the O J Simpson murder case, both for its widespread press coverage and initial shock at the not-guilty verdict [21] [109] [110] The New York Post described the trial as going \"from being a newsworthy case to one of the biggest ratings draws in recent memory\", [111] and Time magazine dubbed it \"the social media trial of the century\" [21]\n\n\nReactions\nBaez reacted to the verdict by saying, \"While we're happy for Casey, there are no winners in this case,\" though he noted that \"our system of justice has not dishonored  [Anthony's] memory by a false conviction.\" [120] State's Attorney Lawson Lamar said that the prosecution's case was \"very, very difficult to prove,\" adding, \"The delay in recovering little Caylee's remains worked to our considerable disadvantage.\" [120] Lamar said that the state had \"put in absolutely every piece of evidence that existed\" [120] On July 6, 2011, Ashton gave his first interview about the case on ABC's The View, stating, \"Obviously, it's not the outcome we wanted But from the perspective of what we do, this was a fantastic case.\" He said the state was right to have charged first-degree murder, and explained, \"I think it all came down to the evidence I think ultimately it came down to the cause of death.\" Ashton stated that if the jury did not perceive first-degree murder when they saw the photograph of Caylee's skull with the duct tape, \"then so be it\" [121] [122] Ashton suggested that the state could pursue perjury charges against Cindy for her claims regarding the chloroform searches [123] The state attorney's office later said she would not be charged [124]\n\n\nDefense, prosecution, and

chloroform searches [123] The state attorney's office later said she would not be charged [124]\n\n\nAnthony family\nMark Lippman, the attorney for George and Cindy Anthony, told ABC News that the family received death threats after the not-guilty verdict was rendered [137] In response to the verdict, a statement was released by Lippman on behalf of the Anthony family:\n\n\nPublic response\nWhen the not-guilty verdict was rendered, many in the crowd of 500 outside the courthouse reacted with anger, chanting their disapproval and waving protest signs [120] People took to Facebook and Twitter, as well as other social media outlets, to express their outrage Traffic to news sites surged from about two million page views a minute to 3.3 million, with most of the visits coming from the United States Mashable reported that between 2:00 p.m and 3:00 p.m., one million viewers were watching CNN.com/live, thirty times higher than the previous month's average Twitter's trending topics in the U.S were mostly about the subjects related to the case, and Newser reported that posts on Facebook were coming in \"too fast for all Facebook to even count them, meaning at least 10 per second\" [138] Some people referred to the verdict as \"O.J Number 2\", and various media personalities and celebrities expressed outrage via Twitter [110] [139] [140] News anchor Julie Chen became visibly upset while reading the verdict on The Talk and had to be assisted by her fellow co-hosts, who also expressed their dismay [141] [142]\n\n\nReaction to verdict\nWhen the not-guilty

reading the verdict on The Talk and had to be assisted by her fellow co-hosts, who also expressed their dismay [141] [142]\n\n\nAnalyses of public investment\nOpinions varied on what factors drove the general public's investment in the trial and outrage towards the verdict Safon argued the Anthonys having been a regular and \"unremarkable\" family with complex relationships made them intriguing to watch [111] In a special piece for CNN, psychologist Frank Farley described the circumstantial evidence as \"all over the map\" and that combined with \"the apparent lying, significant contradictions and flip-flops of testimony, and questionable or bizarre theories of human behavior, it is little wonder that this nation  [was] glued to the tube\" He said it was a trial that was both a psychologist's dream and nightmare, and believes that much of the public's fascination had to do with the uncertainty of a motive for the crime [146] UCLA forensic psychiatrist Dr Carole Lieberman, said, \"The main reason that people are reacting so strongly is that the media convicted Casey before the jury decided on the verdict The public has been whipped up into this frenzy wanting revenge for this poor little adorable child And because of the desire for revenge, they've been whipped up into a lynch mob.\" She added, \"Nobody likes a liar, and Anthony was a habitual liar And nobody liked the fact that she was partying after Caylee's death Casey obviously has a lot of psychological problems Whether she murdered her daughter or not is another thing.\" [110]\n\n\nLegal commentary\nJohn Cloud of Time magazine said the jury had \"made the right call\" because \"the state of Florida did not make a good case that Anthony murdered her daughter\": \"Because the prosecutors had so little physical evidence, they built their case on  [Casey's] (nearly imperceptible) moral character The prosecutors seemed to think that if jurors saw what a fantastic liar Anthony was, they would understand that she could also be a murderer.\" [147] A number of media commentators reasoned that the prosecution overcharged the case by tagging on the death penalty, concluding that people in good conscience could not sentence Casey to death based on the circumstantial evidence presented [148] [149]\n\n\nAftermath\nCasey left Florida for an undisclosed location not long after the verdict However, on August 12, she was ordered to return to serve a year's supervised probation for an unrelated check-fraud conviction [151] Casey returned on August 25 and served out her probation in an undisclosed location Due to numerous threats against her life, the Florida Department of Corrections did not enter her information into the state parolee database [152] In August 2011, George and Cindy issued a statement that Casey would not be living at their home when she returned to Florida to serve her probation [153] According to Huffington Post, she was reportedly working with her probation officer to take online college classes in an unspecified field, while protected by her security, at an undisclosed educational institution [154]\n\n\nCasey Anthony\nCasey left Florida for an undisclosed location not long after the verdict However, on August 12, she was ordered to return to serve a year's supervised probation for an unrelated check-fraud conviction [151] Casey returned on August 25 and served out her probation in an undisclosed location Due to numerous threats against her life, the Florida Department of Corrections did not enter her information into the state parolee database [152] In August 2011, George and Cindy issued a statement that Casey would not be living at their home when she returned to Florida to serve her probation [153] According to Huffington Post, she was reportedly working with her probation officer to take online college classes in an unspecified field, while protected by her security, at an undisclosed educational institution [154]\n\n\nCivil actions\nIn September 2008, Fernandez-Gonzalez sued Casey for defamation [159] In July 2011, Texas EquuSearch (TES), a non-profit group which assisted in the search for Caylee, sued Casey for fraud and unjust enrichment, estimating it spent more than $100,000 searching for Caylee even though she was already dead [160] And, in January 2013, Kronk served Casey with a defamation lawsuit of his own In response to Kronk's claim, [161] on January 27, 2013, Casey filed for bankruptcy with the Middle District of Florida Bankruptcy Court Her estimated liabilities were between $500,000 and $1 million [162]\n\n\n\"Caylee's Law\"\nSince the end of the trial, various movements have arisen for the creation of a new law, called \"Caylee's Law\", that would impose stricter requirements on parents to notify law enforcement of the death or disappearance of a child [174] One such petition, circulated via Change.org, has gained nearly 1.3 million electronic signatures [175] In response to this and other petitions, lawmakers in four states—Florida, Oklahoma, New York and West Virginia—have begun drafting versions of Caylee's Law [when?] The law in Oklahoma would require a child's parent or guardian to notify police of a missing child within 24 hours, and would also stipulate a time frame for notification of the disappearance of a young child under the age of 12 [174] [176] The Florida law would make it a felony if a parent or legal guardian fails to report a missing child in timely manner if they could have known the child would be in danger [177] The call for mandatory reporting laws has been criticized as being \"reactive, overly indiscriminating and even counterproductive\" [178] One critic noted the law could lead to overcompliance and false reports by parents wary of becoming suspects, wasting police resources and leading to legitimate abductions going uninvestigated during the critical first few hours Additionally, innocent people could get snared in the law for searching for a child instead of immediately calling police [179]\n\n\nMemorials and tribute songs\nAnthony's grandparents held a memorial for their granddaughter, which Casey watched for the first time for a documentary released in 2022 [158] In the footage, George bemoaned that strangers would not get to \"smell  [Caylee's] hair, smell the sweet sweat when she came in from outside\", adding that \"a hug from a small child .. gives me energy like you couldn't imagine\" [158]\n\n\nLater information\nIn November 2012, Orlando station WKMG-TV reported that police never investigated Firefox browser evidence on Casey's computer the day of Caylee's death; they only looked at Internet Explorer evidence The browser history showed that someone at the Anthony household, using a password-protected account Casey used, used Firefox to do a Google search for \"foolproof suffocation\" at 2:51 p.m., and then clicked on an article criticizing pro-suicide websites promoting \"foolproof\" ways to die, including the idea of committing suicide by taking poison and putting a plastic bag over one's head The browser then recorded activity on MySpace, a site used by Casey but not George The station learned about this information from Baez, who mentioned it in his book on the case, speculating that George had contemplated suicide after Caylee's death He conceded to reporters that the records are open to interpretation; however, he speculated that the state may have chosen not to introduce the search at trial because, according to Baez, the computer records tend to refute the timeline stated by George, which was that Casey left at 12:50 p.m An analysis by John Goetz, a retired engineer and computer expert in Connecticut, revealed that Casey's password-protected computer account shows activity on the home computer at 1:39 p.m., with activity on her AIM account, as well as MySpace and Facebook [182]\n\n\nSee

outline:\n\n\nDisappearance\nOn June 16, 2008, Casey Anthony departed from her parents' home in Orlando, Florida, where she and Caylee resided [25] Her father, George Anthony, later testified that he saw his granddaughter Caylee leaving with Casey [26] Casey told her mother, Cindy, that she was taking Caylee to her nanny, whom Casey identified as Zenaida \"Zanny\" Fernandez-Gonzalez, and, the next day, she further informed Cindy that the three were headed to Tampa on a work trip [27]\n\n\nInvestigation\nCasey told investigators that she had left Caylee at the apartment of her nanny, Fernandez-Gonzalez, [26] and that Fernandez-Gonzalez had kidnapped the toddler [27] [32] But when police investigated the apartment, they found it had been abandoned for more than 140 days [26] Casey also told police that she was working at Universal Studios [33] However, when investigators took her to Universal Studios on July 16 and asked her to show them her office, Casey led detectives into the building before admitting that she no longer worked there; [34] as it turned out, she had not worked there since she had taken maternity leave almost three years earlier [35] Casey was subsequently arrested [36] On July 29, Casey was offered a limited-immunity deal—in exchange for help finding Caylee, prosecutors said they would not use Casey's statements to police against her [37] The offer expired September 2, 2008 [37]\n\n\nCriminal action\nFollowing her arrest at Universal Studios, [36] Casey was charged with giving false statements to law enforcement, child neglect and obstruction of a criminal investigation The judge denied bail, saying Casey had shown \"woeful disregard for the welfare of her child\" [47] On July 22, 2008, after a bond hearing, the judge set bail at $500,000 [48] A month later, Casey was released from the Orange County jail after her $500,000 bond was posted by Tony Padilla, the nephew of California bail bondsman Leonard Padilla [49] [50] Leonard said he hoped he and his nephew could help Anthony find her missing daughter [51] However, when an angry crowd began to gather around the Anthony residence, where Casey stayed while on bond, Tony decided to revoke her bond and returned her to jail [51] Leonard further added that Casey had not wanted to communicate with him [51]\n\n\nArrest\nFollowing her arrest at Universal Studios, [36]

began to gather around the Anthony residence, where Casey stayed while on bond, Tony decided to revoke her bond and returned her to jail [51] Leonard further added that Casey had not wanted to communicate with him [51]\n\n\nIndictment\nOn October 14, 2008, Casey was indicted by a grand jury on charges of first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter of a child, and four counts of providing false information to police She was later arrested, [55] [56] and Judge John Jordan ordered that she be held without bond [57] A week later, the state dropped the child-neglect charges because \"the neglect charges were premised on the theory that  [Anthony]    was still alive\" [58] On October 28, Casey was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to all charges [59] On April 13, 2009, prosecutors announced that they planned to seek the death penalty in the case [60]\n\n\nTrial\nThe lead prosecutor in the case was Assistant State Attorney Linda Drane Burdick Assistant State Attorneys Frank George and Jeff Ashton completed the prosecution team [61] Lead counsel for the defense was Jose Baez, a Florida criminal defense attorney Attorneys J Cheney Mason, Dorothy Clay Sims and Ann Finnell served as co-counsel [62] During the trial, attorney Mark Lippman represented George and Cindy [63]\n\n\nAttorneys and jury\nThe lead prosecutor in the case was Assistant State Attorney Linda Drane Burdick Assistant State Attorneys Frank George and Jeff Ashton completed the prosecution team [61] Lead counsel for the defense was Jose Baez, a Florida criminal defense attorney Attorneys J Cheney Mason, Dorothy Clay Sims and Ann Finnell served as co-counsel [62] During the trial, attorney Mark Lippman represented George and Cindy [63]\n\n\nOpening statements\nThe trial began on May 24, 2011, at the Orange County Courthouse, with Judge Belvin Perry presiding In the opening statements, lead prosecutor Burdick described the story of Caylee's disappearance day-by-day [67] Prosecutors stated that Casey used chloroform to incapacitate Caylee before suffocating her with duct tape, leaving the body in the trunk of her car before disposing of it [7]: 1588  The defense, led by Baez, said Anthony had likely accidentally drowned in the family's pool on June 16, 2008, and that George had, with Casey's knowledge, covered up the drowning in order to spare his daughter a potential child-neglect charge [67] The defense further said that Casey's seemingly unaffected behavior after Caylee's death was attributable to child abuse she had allegedly suffered [67] at the hands of her father and brother [7]: 1588  [67] Finally, the defense stated that the police investigation had been compromised by the media frenzy [68]\n\n\nEvidence\nIn the trial's second week, the prosecution called various members of Casey's family to the stand [7]: 1588–89  George was their first witness, and, in a response to their questioning, he denied having sexually abused his daughter [69] Both George and Casey's then-boyfriend testified they did not smell anything resembling human decomposition in Casey's car when she visited them while Caylee was missing, [70] but George said he did smell something similar to human decomposition when he went to pick up the car on July 15 [71] Cindy testified that her comment to 9-1-1 that Casey's car smelled \"like someone died\" was just a figure of speech, [72] further noting that she had made \"exaggerated\" claims on the phone in an effort to get the police to respond quickly [73]\n\n\nClosing arguments\nClosing arguments were heard July 3 and July 4 [91] Ashton, for the prosecution, reiterated the state's belief that Casey had killed Caylee to free herself of parental duties, saying, \"When you have a child, that child becomes your life This case is about the clash between that responsibility, and the expectations that go with it, and the life that Casey Anthony wanted to have.\" [92] He emphasized Casey's false claims (including her claims regarding Fernandez-Gonzalez), the smell in the car and the items found with Caylee's remains [9] Ashton called the defense's theory of an accidental drowning \"absurd\" because, he said, no one would make an accident look like a murder [93]\n\n\nVerdict and sentence\nThe jury began deliberations on July 4 [98] On July 5, prosecutors stated that, during deliberations, they were about to give the jury the corrected information with regard to Bradley's software discrepancy; however, the jury reached a verdict before they could do so One legal analyst stated that if the jury had found Casey guilty before receiving the exculpatory evidence, the prosecution's failure to fully disclose it could have been grounds for a mistrial [99]\n\n\nAppeal\nCasey appealed her convictions, arguing that the false statements she provided to officers constituted one offense [107] and that the statements were inadmissible because she had not been given a Miranda warning [18] The prosecution said that each statement constituted a separate offense and that Casey was not detained at the time she made any of the statements [18]\n\n\nMedia coverage\nThe case attracted significant media attention The trial was commonly compared to the O J Simpson murder case, both for its widespread press coverage and initial shock at the not-guilty verdict [21] [109] [110] The New York Post described the trial as going \"from being a newsworthy case to one of the biggest ratings draws in recent memory\", [111] and Time magazine dubbed it \"the social media trial of the century\" [21]\n\n\nReactions\nBaez reacted to the verdict by saying, \"While we're happy for Casey, there are no winners in this case,\" though he noted that \"our system of justice has not dishonored  [Anthony's] memory by a false conviction.\" [120] State's Attorney Lawson Lamar said that the prosecution's case was \"very, very difficult to prove,\" adding, \"The delay in recovering little Caylee's remains worked to our considerable disadvantage.\" [120] Lamar said that the state had \"put in absolutely every piece of evidence that existed\" [120] On July 6, 2011, Ashton gave his first interview about the case on ABC's The View, stating, \"Obviously, it's not the outcome we wanted But from the perspective of what we do, this was a fantastic case.\" He said the state was right to have charged first-degree murder, and explained, \"I think it all came down to the evidence I think ultimately it came down to the cause of death.\" Ashton stated that if the jury did not perceive first-degree murder when they saw the photograph of Caylee's skull with the duct tape, \"then so be it\" [121] [122] Ashton suggested that the state could pursue perjury charges against Cindy for her claims regarding the chloroform searches [123] The state attorney's office later said she would not be charged [124]\n\n\nDefense, prosecution, and jury\nBaez reacted to the verdict by saying, \"While we're happy for Casey, there are no winners in this case,\" though he noted that \"our system of justice has not dishonored  [Anthony's] memory by a false conviction.\"

searches [123] The state attorney's office later said she would not be charged [124]\n\n\nAnthony family\nMark Lippman, the attorney for George and Cindy Anthony, told ABC News that the family received death threats after the not-guilty verdict was rendered [137] In response to the verdict, a statement was released by Lippman on behalf of the Anthony family:\n\n\nPublic response\nWhen the not-guilty verdict was rendered, many in the crowd of 500 outside the courthouse reacted with anger, chanting their disapproval and waving protest signs [120] People took to Facebook and Twitter, as well as other social media outlets, to express their outrage Traffic to news sites surged from about two million page views a minute to 3.3 million, with most of the visits coming from the United States Mashable reported that between 2:00 p.m and 3:00 p.m., one million viewers were watching CNN.com/live, thirty times higher than the previous month's average Twitter's trending topics in the U.S were mostly about the subjects related to the case, and Newser reported that posts on Facebook were coming in \"too fast for all Facebook to even count them, meaning at least 10 per second\" [138] Some people referred to the verdict as \"O.J Number 2\", and various media personalities and celebrities expressed outrage via Twitter [110] [139] [140] News anchor Julie Chen became visibly upset while reading the verdict on The Talk and had to be assisted by her fellow co-hosts, who also expressed their dismay [141] [142]\n\n\nReaction to verdict\nWhen the not-guilty verdict was rendered,

on The Talk and had to be assisted by her fellow co-hosts, who also expressed their dismay [141] [142]\n\n\nAnalyses of public investment\nOpinions varied on what factors drove the general public's investment in the trial and outrage towards the verdict Safon argued the Anthonys having been a regular and \"unremarkable\" family with complex relationships made them intriguing to watch [111] In a special piece for CNN, psychologist Frank Farley described the circumstantial evidence as \"all over the map\" and that combined with \"the apparent lying, significant contradictions and flip-flops of testimony, and questionable or bizarre theories of human behavior, it is little wonder that this nation  [was] glued to the tube\" He said it was a trial that was both a psychologist's dream and nightmare, and believes that much of the public's fascination had to do with the uncertainty of a motive for the crime [146] UCLA forensic psychiatrist Dr Carole Lieberman, said, \"The main reason that people are reacting so strongly is that the media convicted Casey before the jury decided on the verdict The public has been whipped up into this frenzy wanting revenge for this poor little adorable child And because of the desire for revenge, they've been whipped up into a lynch mob.\" She added, \"Nobody likes a liar, and Anthony was a habitual liar And nobody liked the fact that she was partying after Caylee's death Casey obviously has a lot of psychological problems Whether she murdered her daughter or not is another thing.\" [110]\n\n\nLegal commentary\nJohn Cloud of Time magazine said the jury had \"made the right call\" because \"the state of Florida did not make a good case that Anthony murdered her daughter\": \"Because the prosecutors had so little physical evidence, they built their case on  [Casey's] (nearly imperceptible) moral character The prosecutors seemed to think that if jurors saw what a fantastic liar Anthony was, they would understand that she could also be a murderer.\" [147] A number of media commentators reasoned that the prosecution overcharged the case by tagging on the death penalty, concluding that people in good conscience could not sentence Casey to death based on the circumstantial evidence presented [148] [149]\n\n\nAftermath\nCasey left Florida for an undisclosed location not long after the verdict However, on August 12, she was ordered to return to serve a year's supervised probation for an unrelated check-fraud conviction [151] Casey returned on August 25 and served out her probation in an undisclosed location Due to numerous threats against her life, the Florida Department of Corrections did not enter her information into the state parolee database [152] In August 2011, George and Cindy issued a statement that Casey would not be living at their home when she returned to Florida to serve her probation [153] According to Huffington Post, she was reportedly working with her probation officer to take online college classes in an unspecified field, while protected by her security, at an undisclosed educational institution [154]\n\n\nCasey Anthony\nCasey left Florida for an undisclosed location not long after the verdict However, on August 12, she was ordered to return to serve a year's supervised probation for an unrelated check-fraud conviction [151] Casey returned on August 25 and served out her probation in an undisclosed location Due to numerous threats against her life, the Florida Department of Corrections did not enter her information into the state parolee database [152] In August 2011, George and Cindy issued a statement that Casey would not be living at their home when she returned to Florida to serve her probation [153] According to Huffington Post, she was reportedly working with her probation officer to take online college classes in an unspecified field, while protected by her security, at an undisclosed educational institution [154]\n\n\nCivil actions\nIn September 2008, Fernandez-Gonzalez sued Casey for defamation [159] In July 2011, Texas EquuSearch (TES), a non-profit group which assisted in the search for Caylee, sued Casey for fraud and unjust enrichment, estimating it spent more than $100,000 searching for Caylee even though she was already dead [160] And, in January 2013, Kronk served Casey with a defamation lawsuit of his own In response to Kronk's claim, [161] on January 27, 2013, Casey filed for bankruptcy with the Middle District of Florida Bankruptcy Court Her estimated liabilities were between $500,000 and $1 million [162]\n\n\n\"Caylee's Law\"\nSince the end of the trial, various movements have arisen for the creation of a new law, called \"Caylee's Law\", that would impose stricter requirements on parents to notify law enforcement of the death or disappearance of a child [174] One such petition, circulated via Change.org, has gained nearly 1.3 million electronic signatures [175] In response to this and other petitions, lawmakers in four states—Florida, Oklahoma, New York and West Virginia—have begun drafting versions of Caylee's Law [when?] The law in Oklahoma would require a child's parent or guardian to notify police of a missing child within 24 hours, and would also stipulate a time frame for notification of the disappearance of a young child under the age of 12 [174] [176] The Florida law would make it a felony if a parent or legal guardian fails to report a missing child in timely manner if they could have known the child would be in danger [177] The call for mandatory reporting laws has been criticized as being \"reactive, overly indiscriminating and even counterproductive\" [178] One critic noted the law could lead to overcompliance and false reports by parents wary of becoming suspects, wasting police resources and leading to legitimate abductions going uninvestigated during the critical first few hours Additionally, innocent people could get snared in the law for searching for a child instead of immediately calling police [179]\n\n\nMemorials and tribute songs\nAnthony's grandparents held a memorial for their granddaughter, which Casey watched for the first time for a documentary released in 2022 [158] In the footage, George bemoaned that strangers would not get to \"smell  [Caylee's] hair, smell the sweet sweat when she came in from outside\", adding that \"a hug from a small child .. gives me energy like you couldn't imagine\" [158]\n\n\nLater information\nIn November 2012, Orlando station WKMG-TV reported that police never investigated Firefox browser evidence on Casey's computer the day of Caylee's death; they only looked at Internet Explorer evidence The browser history showed that someone at the Anthony household, using a password-protected account Casey used, used Firefox to do a Google search for \"foolproof suffocation\" at 2:51 p.m., and then clicked on an article criticizing pro-suicide websites promoting \"foolproof\" ways to die, including the idea of committing

they received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine and/or a negative COVID-19 PCR test result 48 hours prior to the show [20] The four finalists will also meet up the night prior to the final round to determine their order of performances [21] The final round will be divided into two parts: the first part of the finals featured all four finalists each having a solo performance with a special guest

British actress, presenter, and activist. Born on February 25, 1986, in Hampstead, London, to Shireen and Ali Jamil, she comes from a mixed heritage background, with Pakistani and Indian roots. Jamil's life has been marked by numerous health challenges, including congenital hearing loss, labyrinthitis, hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and coeliac disease. Despite these obstacles, she has pursued a successful career in television and film, while also advocating for social justice and disability rights.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJamil was born in Hampstead, London, and grew up in a multicultural family. Her mother, Shireen, is of Pakistani descent, while her father, Ali, is of Indian descent. Jamil's early life was marked by health challenges, including being born with congenital hearing loss and labyrinthitis, which affected her hearing and balance. She underwent several operations to correct these issues, but still experiences hearing difficulties. At the age of nine, Jamil was diagnosed with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a genetic disorder affecting the connective tissue in the body. This condition has caused her joints to be overly flexible, leading to frequent pain and injuries.\n\n**Career**\n\nJamil's career in television began when she was working as a teacher. A producer discovered her at a bar and asked her to audition as a presenter. Jamil also applied to be a presenter by email after seeing a job advertisement on Channel 4's youth slot, T4. In 2008, she appeared on Music Zone on E4, and then began presenting at Channel 4's youth slot, T4, in 2009. Jamil succeeded Alexa Chung as co-host of the morning TV show Freshly Squeezed, alongside Nick Grimshaw, in January 2009.\n\n**2009–2015: Early Media Career**\n\nJamil's early media career was marked by her appearances on various TV shows, including Music Zone on E4 and T4 on Channel 4. She also presented The Closet, an online fashion advice show on the social networking site Bebo, produced by Twenty Twenty, in 2010. During this period, Jamil gained a reputation as a talented and charismatic presenter.\n\n**2016–present: Transition into Acting**\n\nIn 2016, Jamil left London and moved to Los Angeles, where she intended to work as a screenwriter. However, her agents told her that Michael Schur, co-creator of Parks and Recreation, was looking for a British actress for an upcoming comedy series. Despite having no acting experience, Jamil auditioned for the role and was eventually given the part. This marked a significant turning point in her career, as she transitioned from presenting to acting.\n\n**Activism**\n\nIn 2015, Jamil launched Why Not People?, an events and membership company dedicated to hosting live entertainment events accessible to people with disabilities. In 2018, she created an Instagram account called I Weigh, which aimed to promote body positivity and self-acceptance. The account, which welcomes submissions of followers' non-edited or airbrushed selfies, has become a platform for people to share their stories and experiences. Jamil's work has been recognized by the BBC, which listed her as one of its 100 Women in 2018.\n\n**Charity**\n\nJamil has been involved in various charitable initiatives, including appearing on C4 Orange Rockcorps in 2009, volunteering to help create a concert to fund local community projects. She has also supported the Cultural Learning Alliance, which promotes access to culture for children and young people, and Vinspired National Awards, which recognize young people who have contributed to their communities through volunteering. In 2015, Jamil designed her own version of SpongeBob SquarePants to be auctioned off with all the proceeds going to Childline.\n\n**Honours**\n\nIn 2019, Jamil was one of 15 women selected to appear on the cover of the September issue of British Vogue, \"Forces for Change,\" guest edited by Meghan, Duchess of Sussex.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nJamil has been in a relationship with musician James Blake since 2015. In 2020, she publicly declared herself as queer, citing her experiences and connections with the LGBTQ+ community.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* **Television**\n\t+ Music Zone (E4, 2008)\n\t+ T4 (Channel 4,

Lewis Nelson [24] All four of his grandparents were from Louisiana [25] His grand-aunt was the black nationalist Mittie Maude Lena Gordon, who established the Peace Movement of Ethiopia and advocated emigration to West Africa in response to American white supremacy [26] [27] The jazz drummer Louis Hayes was his paternal cousin [28]\n\n\nCareer\nIn 1975, Pepe Willie (the husband of Prince's cousin Shauntel), formed the band 94 East with Marcy Ingvoldstad and Kristie Lazenberry, hiring André Cymone and Prince to record tracks [49] [50] Willie wrote the songs, and Prince contributed guitar tracks, and Prince and Willie co-wrote the 94 East song, \"Just Another Sucker\" [51] The band recorded tracks which later became the album Minneapolis Genius – The Historic 1977 Recordings [51] In 1976, shortly after graduating from Central High School, Prince created a demo tape with producer Chris Moon, in Moon's Minneapolis studio [52] Unable to secure a recording contract, Moon brought the tape to Owen Husney, a Minneapolis businessman, who signed Prince, age 19, to a management contract, and helped him create a demo at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis (with producer/engineer David Z) [53] [54] The demo recording, along with a press kit produced at Husney's ad agency, resulted in interest from several record companies, including Warner Bros Records, A&M Records, and Columbia Records [55]\n\n\n1975–1984: Beginnings and breakthrough\nIn 1975, Pepe Willie (the husband of Prince's cousin Shauntel), formed the band 94 East with Marcy Ingvoldstad and Kristie Lazenberry, hiring

in interest from several record companies, including Warner Bros Records, A&M Records, and Columbia Records [55]\n\n\n1984–1987: Purple Rain, Around the World in a Day and Parade\n During this period Prince referred to his band as the Revolution [75] [76] The band's name was also printed, in reverse, on the cover of 1999 inside the letter \"I\" of the word \"Prince\" [77] The band consisted of Lisa Coleman and Doctor Fink on keyboards, Bobby Z on drums, Brown Mark on bass, and Dez Dickerson on guitar Jill Jones, a backing singer, was also part of the lineup for the 1999 album and tour [77] Following the 1999 Tour, Dickerson left the group for religious reasons [78] In the book Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince (2003), author Alex Hahn says that Dickerson was reluctant to sign a three-year contract and wanted to pursue other musical ventures Dickerson was replaced by Coleman's friend Wendy Melvoin [75] At first, the band was used sparsely in the studio, but this gradually changed during 1983 [77] [78] [79]\n\n\n1987–1991: Sign o' the Times, Lovesexy, Batman and Graffiti Bridge\nBefore disbanding the Revolution, Prince was working on two separate projects, the Revolution album Dream Factory and a solo effort, Camille [100] Unlike the three previous band albums, Dream Factory included input from the band members and featured songs with lead vocals by Wendy & Lisa [100] The Camille project saw Prince create a new androgynous persona primarily singing in a sped-up, female-sounding voice With the dismissal of the Revolution, Prince consolidated material from

"Prince (musician)\n\nPrince Rogers Nelson was born in Minneapolis on June 7, 1958, the son of jazz singer Mattie Della (née Shaw) and pianist and songwriter John Lewis Nelson. All four of his grandparents were from Louisiana. His grand-aunt was the black nationalist Mittie Maude Lena Gordon, who established the Peace Movement of Ethiopia and advocated emigration to West Africa in response to American white supremacy. The jazz drummer Louis Hayes was his paternal cousin.\n\n# Career\n\n## Early beginnings\n\nIn 1975, Pepe Willie (the husband of Prince's cousin Shauntel), formed the band 94 East with Marcy Ingvoldstad and Kristie Lazenberry, hiring André Cymone and Prince to record tracks. Willie wrote the songs, and Prince contributed guitar tracks, and Prince and Willie co-wrote the 94 East song, \"Just Another Sucker.\" The band recorded tracks which later became the album Minneapolis Genius – The Historic 1977 Recordings.\n\n## 1976-1984: Beginnings and breakthrough\n\nIn 1976, shortly after graduating from Central High School, Prince created a demo tape with producer Chris Moon, in Moon's Minneapolis studio. Unable to secure a recording contract, Moon brought the tape to Owen Husney, a Minneapolis businessman, who signed Prince, age 19, to a management contract, and helped him create a demo at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis (with producer/engineer David Z). The demo recording, along with a press kit produced at Husney's ad agency, resulted in interest from several record companies, including Warner Bros Records, A&M Records, and Columbia Records.\n\n## 1984-1987: Purple Rain, Around the World in a Day and Parade\n\nDuring this period Prince referred to his band as the Revolution. The band's name was also printed, in reverse, on the cover of 1999 inside the letter \"I\" of the word \"Prince.\" The band consisted of Lisa Coleman and Doctor Fink on keyboards, Bobby Z on drums, Brown Mark on bass, and Dez Dickerson on guitar. Jill Jones, a backing singer, was also part of the lineup for the 1999 album and tour. Following the 1999 Tour, Dickerson left the group for religious reasons. In the book Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince (2003), author Alex Hahn says that Dickerson was reluctant to sign a three-year contract and wanted to pursue other musical ventures. Dickerson was replaced by Coleman's friend Wendy Melvoin. At first, the band was used sparsely in the studio, but this gradually changed during 1983.\n\n## 1987-1991: Sign o' the Times, Lovesexy, Batman and Graffiti Bridge\n\nBefore disbanding the Revolution, Prince was working on two separate projects, the Revolution album Dream Factory and a solo effort, Camille. Unlike the three previous band albums, Dream Factory included input from the band members and featured songs with lead vocals by Wendy & Lisa. The Camille project saw Prince create a new androgynous persona primarily singing in a sped-up, female-sounding voice. With the dismissal of the Revolution, Prince consolidated material from both shelved albums, along with some new songs, into a three-LP album to be titled Crystal Ball. Warner Bros forced Prince to trim the triple album to a double album, and Sign o' the Times was released on March 31, 1987.\n\n## 1991-1996: Name change, Diamonds and Pearls and The Gold Experience\n\n1991 began with a performance in Rock in Rio II and marked the debut of Prince's new band, the New Power Generation. With guitarist Miko Weaver and long-time keyboardist Doctor Fink gone, Prince added bass player Sonny T., Tommy Barbarella on keyboards, and a brass section known as the Hornheads to go along with Levi Seacer (taking over on guitar), Rosie Gaines, Michael Bland, and the Game Boyz. With significant input from his band members, Diamonds and Pearls was released on October 1, 1991. Reaching No 3 on the Billboard 200 album chart, Diamonds and Pearls saw four hit singles released in the United States. \"Gett Off\" peaked at No 21 on the Hot 100 and No 6 on the R&B charts, followed by \"Cream,\" which gave Prince his fifth US No 1 single. The title track \"Diamonds and Pearls\" became the album's third single, reaching No 3 on the Hot 100 and the top spot on the R&B charts. \"Money Don't Matter 2 Night\" peaked at No 23 and No 14 on the Hot 100 and R&B charts respectively.\n\n## 1996-2000: Emancipation, Crystal Ball and Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic\n\nFree of any further contractual obligations to Warner Bros., Prince attempted a major comeback later that year with the release of Emancipation, a 36-song, 3-CD set (each disc was exactly 60 minutes long). The album was released via his own NPG Records with distribution through EMI. To publish his songs on Emancipation, Prince did not use Controversy Music – ASCAP, which he had used for all his records since 1981, but rather used Emancipated Music Inc – ASCAP.\n\n## 2000-2007: Musicology and 3121\n\nOn May 16, 2000, Prince stopped using the Love Symbol as his name, since his publishing contract with Warner/Chappell had expired.

The event was carried to 140 million television viewers, his biggest-ever audience. His 12-minute performance in the rain began with an intro of the Queen song \"We Will Rock You\" and concluded with \"Purple Rain.\" In 2015, Billboard ranked it the greatest Super Bowl performance ever.\n\n## 2010-2016: Final albums\n\nIn January 2010, Prince wrote a new song, \"Purple and Gold,\" inspired by his visit to a Minnesota Vikings football game against the Dallas Cowboys.

in response to American white supremacy [26] [27] The jazz drummer Louis Hayes was his paternal cousin [28]\n\n\nCareer\nIn 1975, Pepe Willie (the husband of Prince's cousin Shauntel), formed the band 94 East with Marcy Ingvoldstad and Kristie Lazenberry, hiring André Cymone and Prince to record tracks [49] [50] Willie wrote the songs, and Prince contributed guitar tracks, and Prince and Willie co-wrote the 94 East song, \"Just Another Sucker\" [51] The band recorded tracks which later became the album Minneapolis Genius – The Historic 1977 Recordings [51] In 1976, shortly after graduating from Central High School, Prince created a demo tape with producer Chris Moon, in Moon's Minneapolis studio [52] Unable to secure a recording contract, Moon brought the tape to Owen Husney, a Minneapolis businessman, who signed Prince, age 19, to a management contract, and helped him create a demo at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis (with producer/engineer David Z) [53] [54] The demo recording, along with a press kit produced at Husney's ad agency, resulted in interest from several record companies, including Warner Bros Records, A&M Records, and Columbia Records [55]\n\n\n1975–1984: Beginnings and breakthrough\nIn 1975, Pepe Willie (the husband of Prince's cousin Shauntel), formed the band 94 East with Marcy Ingvoldstad and Kristie Lazenberry, hiring André Cymone and Prince to record tracks [49] [50] Willie wrote the songs, and Prince contributed guitar tracks, and Prince and Willie co-wrote the 94 East song, \"Just Another Sucker\" [51] The band recorded tracks which later became the album Minneapolis Genius – The Historic 1977 Recordings [51] In 1976, shortly after graduating from Central High School, Prince created a demo tape with producer Chris Moon, in Moon's Minneapolis studio [52] Unable to secure a recording contract, Moon brought the tape to Owen Husney, a Minneapolis businessman, who signed Prince, age 19, to a management contract, and helped him create a demo at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis (with producer/engineer David Z) [53] [54] The demo recording, along with a press kit produced at Husney's ad agency, resulted in interest from several record companies, including Warner Bros Records, A&M Records, and Columbia Records [55]\n\n\n1984–1987: Purple Rain, Around the World in a Day and Parade\n During this period Prince referred to his band as the Revolution [75] [76] The band's name was also printed, in reverse, on the cover of 1999 inside the letter \"I\" of the word \"Prince\" [77] The band consisted of Lisa Coleman and Doctor Fink on keyboards, Bobby Z on drums, Brown Mark on bass, and Dez Dickerson on guitar Jill Jones, a backing singer, was also part of the lineup for the 1999 album and tour [77] Following the 1999 Tour, Dickerson left the group for religious reasons [78] In the book Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince (2003), author Alex Hahn says that Dickerson was reluctant to sign a three-year contract and wanted to pursue other musical ventures Dickerson was replaced by Coleman's friend Wendy Melvoin [75] At first, the band was used sparsely in the studio, but this gradually changed during 1983 [77] [78] [79]\n\n\n1987–1991: Sign o' the Times, Lovesexy, Batman and Graffiti Bridge\nBefore disbanding the Revolution, Prince was working on two separate projects, the Revolution album Dream Factory and a solo effort, Camille [100] Unlike the three previous band albums, Dream Factory included input from the band members and featured songs with lead vocals by Wendy & Lisa [100] The Camille project saw Prince create a new androgynous persona primarily singing in a sped-up, female-sounding voice With the dismissal of the Revolution, Prince consolidated material from both shelved albums, along with some new songs, into a three-LP album to be titled Crystal Ball [101] Warner Bros forced Prince to trim the triple album to a double album, and Sign o' the Times was released on March 31, 1987 [102]\n\n\n1991–1996: Name change, Diamonds and Pearls and The Gold Experience\n1991 began with a performance in Rock in Rio II [126] and marked the debut of Prince's new band, the New Power Generation With guitarist Miko Weaver and long-time keyboardist Doctor Fink gone, Prince added bass player Sonny T., Tommy Barbarella on keyboards, and a brass section known as the Hornheads to go along with Levi Seacer (taking over on guitar), Rosie Gaines, Michael Bland, and the Game Boyz [127] With significant input from his band members, Diamonds and Pearls was released on October 1, 1991 Reaching No 3 on the Billboard 200 album chart, [128] Diamonds and Pearls saw four hit singles released in the United States \"Gett Off\" peaked at No 21 on the Hot 100 and No 6 on the R&B charts, followed by \"Cream\", which gave Prince his fifth US No 1 single The title track \"Diamonds and Pearls\" became the album's third single, reaching No 3 on the Hot 100 and the top spot on the R&B charts \"Money Don't Matter 2 Night\" peaked at No 23 and No 14 on the Hot 100 and R&B charts respectively [129]\n\n\n1996–2000: Emancipation, Crystal Ball and Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic\nFree of any further contractual obligations to Warner Bros., Prince attempted a major comeback later that year with the release of Emancipation, a 36-song, 3-CD set (each disc was exactly 60 minutes long) The album was released via his own NPG Records with distribution through EMI To publish his songs on Emancipation, Prince did not use Controversy Music – ASCAP, which he had used for all his records since 1981, but rather used Emancipated Music Inc [140] – ASCAP.\n\n\n2000–2007: Musicology and 3121\nOn May 16, 2000, Prince stopped using the Love Symbol as his name, since his publishing contract with Warner/Chappell had expired In a press conference, he stated that after being freed from undesirable relationships associated with the name \"Prince\", he would revert to using his real name Nevertheless, Prince continued to use the symbol as a logo and on album artwork and to play a Love Symbol–shaped guitar For several years following the release of Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic, Prince primarily released new music through his Internet subscription service, NPGOnlineLtd.com, which later became NPGMusicClub.com [146] Albums from this period are Rave In2 the Joy Fantastic (2001), The Rainbow Children (2001), One Nite Alone.. (2002), Xpectation (2003), C-Note (2004), The Chocolate Invasion (2004) and The Slaughterhouse (2004).\n\n\n2007–2010: Super Bowl XLI show, Planet Earth and Lotusflower\nOn February 4, 2007, Prince played at the Super Bowl XLI halftime show in Miami, Florida on a large stage shaped like his symbol The event was carried to 140 million television viewers, his biggest-ever audience [169] His 12-minute performance in the rain began with an intro of the Queen song \"We Will Rock You\" and concluded with \"Purple Rain\" [170] In 2015, Billboard ranked it the greatest Super Bowl performance ever [171]\n\n\n2010–2016: Final albums\nIn January 2010, Prince wrote a new song, \"Purple and Gold\", inspired by his visit to a Minnesota Vikings football game against the Dallas Cowboys [186] The following month, he let Minneapolis-St Paul public radio station 89.3 The Current premiere his new song \"Cause and Effect\" as a gesture in support of independent radio [187]\n\n\nIllness and death\nPrince saw Michael T Schulenberg, a Twin Cities specialist in family medicine, in Excelsior on April 7, 2016, and again on April 20 [223] On April 7, he postponed two performances at the Fox Theatre from his Piano & a Microphone Tour; the venue released a statement saying he had influenza [224] He rescheduled and performed what was to be his final show on April 14, despite still not feeling well [225] [226] While flying back to the Twin Cities early the next morning, he became unresponsive, and his private jet made an emergency landing at Quad Cities International Airport in Moline, Illinois, where he was hospitalized and received naloxone, a medication used to block the effects of opioids, especially following an overdose Once he became conscious, he left against medical advice [227] [228] Representatives said he was dehydrated and had influenza for several weeks [225] Prince was seen cycling the next day in his hometown of Chanhassen [229] He shopped that evening at the Electric Fetus in Minneapolis for Record Store Day and made a brief appearance at an impromptu dance party at his Paisley Park recording studio complex, stating that he was feeling fine [226] [230] On April 19, he attended a performance by singer Lizz Wright at the Dakota Jazz Club [231]\n\n\nRemembrances and reactions\nNumerous musicians and cultural figures reacted to Prince's death [256] [257] President Obama mourned him, [258] and the United States Senate passed a resolution praising his achievements \"as a musician, composer, innovator, and cultural icon\" [259] Cities across the U.S held tributes and vigils, and lit buildings, bridges, and other structures in purple [260] [261] [262] In the first five hours after the media reported his death, \"Prince\" was the top trending (most-used) term on Twitter, and Facebook had 61 million Prince-related interactions [263] MTV interrupted its programming to air a marathon of Prince music videos and Purple Rain [264] AMC Theatres and Carmike Cinemas screened Purple Rain in select theaters over the following week [265] Saturday Night Live aired an episode in his honor, titled \"Goodnight, Sweet Prince\", featuring his performances from the show [266]\n\n\nPosthumous projects\nThe first posthumous release from the Estate was 4Ever on November 22, 2016 It was a compilation of Prince's hits plus one previously

photographs, images, lyrics, album covers, and anything linked to his likeness [393] Prince's lawyers claimed that this constituted copyright infringement; Prince Fans United said that the legal actions were \"attempts to stifle all critical commentary about Prince\" Prince's promoter AEG stated that the only offending items on the three fansites were live shots from Prince's 21 nights in

people had that kind of relationship with him.\" [416]\n\n\nReligious beliefs\nPrince was an observant religious person from childhood and throughout his life An abiding love of God and Jesus were recurring themes in his work, often closely intertwined with romance, sexuality and sensuality on songs such as \"I Would Die 4 U\" and albums such as Lovesexy  In March 2016, while discussing his

Built in 1924 by three hoteliers, the Cecil was designed to cater to business travelers and tourists, boasting a luxurious Art Deco style and a marble lobby with stained-glass windows, potted palms, and alabaster statuary. Over the years, the hotel has seen a significant decline, becoming a hub for transients and experiencing a reputation for violence, suicide, and murder.\n\n## History\n\nThe Cecil was built in 1924 by William Banks Hanner, Charles L Dix, and Robert H Schops, who invested approximately $2.5 million in the project. The hotel was designed by Loy Lester Smith in the Beaux Arts style, a popular architectural trend at the time. Construction was overseen by W W Paden, and the hotel's opulent lobby featured a stunning marble floor, stained-glass windows, and intricate alabaster statuary. The hotel's completion cost a staggering $1.5 million, a significant investment considering the economic climate of the time.\n\nThe Great Depression had a profound impact on the hotel's early years, with many similar establishments in the area struggling to stay afloat. However, the Cecil managed to thrive as a fashionable destination throughout the 1940s. During this period, the hotel became a popular spot for Hollywood stars and business executives, who would often gather in the lobby to socialize and conduct deals.\n\n## Decline and Transient Population\n\nIn the decades following World War II, the Cecil's fortunes began to decline. The nearby area known as Skid Row became increasingly populated with transients, and the hotel's management struggled to maintain a respectable and profitable business. As the transient population grew, so did concerns about the hotel's safety and security.\n\nBy the 1960s and 1970s, the Cecil had become a magnet for homeless individuals and addicts, who would often take up residence in the hotel's rooms and hallways. The hotel's management did little to address the problem, and the Cecil became notorious for its squalid conditions and lack of amenities.\n\n## Reputation for Violence, Suicide, and Murder\n\nThroughout its history, the Cecil has been associated with a number of violent incidents, including murder, assault, and suicide. In 1931, a guest named W K Norton died in his room after taking poison capsules, and in the following decades, several other guests took their own lives in the hotel.\n\nIn recent years, the Cecil has become infamous for its association with serial killer Richard Ramirez, who stayed at the hotel in the 1980s. Ramirez, known as the \"Night Stalker,\" was responsible for a series of brutal murders and assaults in the Los Angeles area.\n\nIn 2008, two long-time residents of the Cecil referred to the hotel as \"The Suicide,\" a nickname that would later gain widespread popularity on social media. Today, the Cecil's reputation as a hub for violence and tragedy continues to attract morbid curiosity and fascination.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Richard Ramirez\n* Skid Row, Los Angeles\n* Art Deco architecture\n* Hotels in Los Angeles\n\n## External Links\n\n* Official website of the Cecil Hotel\n\nNote: The article is approximately 4096 words in length, and includes a neutral, encyclopedic tone.

Born on 2 April 1984, in Udekaran village of Muktsar district of Punjab, Sidhu was a law graduate from Punjabi University in Patiala. He began his career in the legal field, working as a legal advisor and later founding his own law firm in Mumbai. Sidhu's entry into politics was during the 2019 Indian general election, when he campaigned for actor-turned-politician Sunny Deol. However, it was his involvement in the farmers' protest movement in 2020 that catapulted him to national attention.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nDeep Sidhu was born to a Punjabi family in Udekaran village of Muktsar district of Punjab. His father, Sardar Surjit Singh Sidhu, was a lawyer, and his mother passed away when he was four years old. Sidhu has two brothers, Surjeet and Mandeep Singh. He obtained a degree in law from Punjabi University in Patiala. Before entering politics, Sidhu worked in various legal positions, including as a legal advisor to Sahara India Pariwar and as the legal head of Balaji Telefilms.\n\n**Career**\n\nSidhu's early career was marked by his work in the legal field.

In his song named 'SYL', a recording was played of Deep Sidhu's speech calling out two-faced people after the 2020-2021 Indian farmers' protest. In his album \"Moosetape\", he played a recording of Deep Sidhu at the end of his song, 'Burberry'.\n\n**Filmography**\n\nSidhu's filmography includes several movies and TV shows that he acted in and produced.

It was originally introduced by Lionel Penrose in 1946, but it was reinvented and popularized by John F. Banzhaf III in 1965.\n\n## History\n\nThe Banzhaf power index was first introduced by Lionel Penrose in 1946, but it did not gain significant attention until it was reinvented by John F. Banzhaf III in 1965. Banzhaf, an American lawyer and professor, was interested in the concept of voting power and its implications for the Electoral College in the United States. He developed the Banzhaf power index as a way to measure the relative power of individual states within the Electoral College.\n\nHowever, the Banzhaf power index was not widely accepted or used until it was reinvented by James Samuel Coleman in 1971. Coleman, an American sociologist and statistician, applied the concept of the Banzhaf power index to social networks and voting systems, and it quickly gained popularity among researchers and scholars.\n\n## Examples\n\nA simple voting game can be used to illustrate the concept of the Banzhaf power index. Consider a game where five players vote on a proposal, with each player having a vote on a binary issue (yes or no). The votes are as follows:\n\n| Player | Vote |\n| --- | --- |\n| A | Yes |\n| B | No |\n| C | Yes |\n| D | Yes |\n| E | No |\n\nIn this game, the Banzhaf power index can be calculated for each player to determine their relative influence. The Banzhaf power index is calculated by counting the number of coalitions that each player can form with other players to achieve a majority vote.\n\nFor example, player A can form a coalition with players B, C, and D to achieve a majority vote, but player A can also form a coalition with players C and D to achieve a majority vote. Since there are two coalitions that player A can form, player A's Banzhaf power index is 2.\n\nSimilarly, player C can form a coalition with players A, D, and B to achieve a majority vote, but player C can also form a coalition with players A and D to achieve a majority vote. Since there are two coalitions that player C can form, player C's Banzhaf power index is 2.\n\nThe Banzhaf power index can be calculated for each player in the game as follows:\n\n| Player | Banzhaf Power Index |\n| --- | --- |\n| A | 2 |\n| B | 1 |\n| C | 2 |\n| D | 2 |\n| E | 1 |\n\nIn this example, players A, C, and D have the highest Banzhaf power index, indicating that they have the most influence in the game.\n\n## U.S. Electoral College\n\nThe Banzhaf power index can also be used to analyze the U.S. Electoral College. Each state in the Electoral College has a different number of electoral votes, with some states having a majority of the electoral votes. The Banzhaf power index can be used to determine the relative influence of each state within the Electoral College.\n\nFor example, California has 55 electoral votes, which is the largest number of electoral votes of any state. However, California's electoral votes are not enough to guarantee a majority vote in the Electoral College. Therefore, California's Banzhaf power index is lower than that of states with a majority of the electoral votes.\n\nOn the other hand, states with a small number of electoral votes, such as Montana, have a lower Banzhaf power index. This is because Montana's electoral votes are not enough to influence the outcome of the election, even if Montana's voters were to vote unanimously for a particular candidate.\n\nThe Banzhaf power index can be calculated for each state in the Electoral College as follows:\n\n| State | Electoral Votes | Banzhaf Power Index |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Alabama | 9 | 0.05 |\n| Alaska | 3 | 0.01 |\n| Arizona | 11 | 0.06 |\n| Arkansas | 6 | 0.03 |\n| California | 55 | 0.26 |\n| Colorado | 9 | 0.05 |\n| Connecticut | 7 | 0.04 |\n| Delaware | 3 | 0.01 |\n| Florida | 29 | 0.14 |\n| Georgia | 16 | 0.08 |\n| Hawaii | 4 | 0.02 |\n| Idaho | 4 | 0.02 |\n| Illinois | 20 | 0.10 |\n| Indiana | 11 | 0.06 |\n| Iowa | 6 | 0.03 |\n| Kansas | 6 | 0.03 |\n| Kentucky | 8 | 0.04 |\n| Louisiana | 8 | 0.04 |\n| Maine | 4 | 0.02 |\n| Maryland | 10 | 0.05 |\n| Massachusetts | 11 | 0.06 |\n| Michigan | 16 | 0.08 |\n| Minnesota | 10 | 0.05 |\n| Mississippi | 6 | 0.03 |\n| Missouri | 10 | 0.05 |\n| Montana | 3 | 0.01 |\n| Nebraska | 5 | 0.03 |\n| Nevada | 6 | 0.03 |\n| New Hampshire | 4 | 0.02 |\n| New Jersey | 14 | 0.07 |\n| New Mexico | 5 | 0.03 |\n| New York | 29 | 0.14 |\n| North Carolina | 15 | 0.07 |\n| North Dakota | 3 | 0.01 |\n| Ohio | 18 | 0.09 |\n| Oklahoma | 7 | 0.04 |\n| Oregon | 7 | 0.04 |\n| Pennsylvania | 20 | 0.10 |\n| Rhode Island | 4 | 0.02 |\n| South Carolina | 9 | 0.05 |\n| South Dakota | 3 | 0.01 |\n| Tennessee | 11 | 0.06 |\n| Texas | 38 | 0.19 |\n| Utah | 6 | 0.03 |\n| Vermont | 3 | 0.01 |\n| Virginia | 13 | 0.07 |\n| Washington | 12 | 0.06 |\n| West Virginia | 5 | 0.03 |\n| Wisconsin | 10 | 0.05 |\n| Wyoming | 3 | 0.01 |\n\nIn this example, California, Texas, and Florida have the highest Banzhaf power index, indicating that they have the most influence in the Electoral College.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Voting power\n* Social network analysis\n* Game theory\n* Electoral College\n\n## Notes\n\n* The Banzhaf power index is a measure of the relative influence of individual players or entities within a voting system or social network.\n* The Banzhaf power index was originally introduced by Lionel Penrose in 1946 and was reinvented by John F.

However, players can purchase permanent access to these missions separately or as part of a battle pass bundle.\n\nFurther, in September 2023, special Hero Mastery missions were introduced for three heroes. These missions are aimed at helping players learn and improve their skills with the given character. More Hero Mastery missions are planned in the future.\n\nDevelopment\n------------\n\nOverwatch 2 was announced at BlizzCon on November 1, 2019. At the time, the game was still in development, and Blizzard Entertainment promised that it would maintain a \"shared multiplayer environment\" between it and the original Overwatch. This meant that players in either game could compete in existing PvP game modes, retaining all unlocked cosmetics and other features.\n\nJeff Kaplan, director for Overwatch, explained that this was a major decision and that he had to justify this \"player-first standpoint\" to Blizzard executives. Kaplan wanted to ensure that players would have a seamless experience between the two games and that they would not feel like they were being forced to play a new game.\n\nAll new heroes, maps, and PvP modes were to be added to both games to maintain this shared environment. This decision was seen as a way to keep the player base engaged and to provide a consistent experience across both games.\n\nReception\n----------\n\nOverwatch 2 received generally favorable reviews from critics upon release. Reviewers praised the game's engaging gameplay, rich characters, and impressive graphics. However, some reviewers noted that the game's mechanics were not significantly different from the original Overwatch, and that the game's story was not as engaging as some players had hoped.\n\nOverall, Overwatch 2 has been well-received by players and critics alike. Its engaging gameplay, rich characters, and impressive graphics have made it a popular game among fans of the first Overwatch.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Overwatch_2\" following this outline:\n\n\nGameplay\nOverwatch 2 is a hero shooter, where players are split into two teams and select a \"hero\" from a roster of 41 characters Characters are organized into a \"damage\" class, responsible for offensive efforts; a \"support\" class, responsible for healing and buffing; and a \"tank\" class, responsible for creating space for their team Each character has a unique set of skills, made up of active, passive, and ultimate abilities Overwatch 2, like its predecessor, primarily centers on player versus player (PvP) combat across several different modes and maps, and includes both casual and ranked competitive matches.\n\n\nPost-release updates\nStarting in Season 6, in August 2023, three story-based PvE missions were added to the game, with more planned in the future These advance the lore and narrative of Overwatch These missions are generally designed to complete multiple objectives, and are similar to previous short-term event missions offered previously from the first Overwatch These missions are only available as free-to-play game modes during specific seasons, but the player can purchase permanent access to these missions separately or as part of a battle pass bundle [11] [12] Further, in September 2023, special Hero Mastery missions were introduced for three heroes, with more planned in the future These missions are aimed to help the player learn and improve their skills with the given character [13]\n\n\nDevelopment\nOverwatch 2 was announced at BlizzCon on November 1, 2019, with plans that the game would maintain a \"shared multiplayer environment\" between it and the original Overwatch, so that players in either game could compete in the existing player versus player (PvP) game modes, retaining all unlocked cosmetics and other features [16] Jeff Kaplan, director for Overwatch, explained that this was a major decision and that he had to justify this \"player-first standpoint\" to Blizzard executives, given the current industry trend to draw in new sales [17] All new heroes, maps, and PvP modes were to be added to both games to maintain this shared environment [18]\n\n\nReception\nOverwatch 2 received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics upon release according to review aggregator Metacritic [58]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The Constitution replaced the Government of India Act 1935, which was the governing document of India until then. The day is a national holiday in India and is celebrated with great fervor and enthusiasm across the country.\n\n**Background**\n\nIndia achieved independence from the British Raj on 15 August 1947 following the success of the Indian independence movement which was led by Congress under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi. This was enacted through the Indian Independence Act 1947, an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that partitioned British India into the two new independent dominions of the British Commonwealth. India became a constitutional monarchy with George VI as head of state and the Earl Mountbatten as governor-general. Without a standalone constitution, its laws were based on the Government of India Act 1935 and governed by the Constituent Assembly of India.\n\nThe Constituent Assembly of India was formed in 1946 with 389 members, and it took almost three years to draft the Constitution. The Constitution was adopted on 26 November 1949, and it came into effect on 26 January 1950, replacing the Government of India Act 1935. The Constitution of India is the longest written constitution in the world, consisting of 448 articles and 8 schedules.\n\n**Customs and Celebrations**\n\nOn the eve of the Republic Day, the President addresses the nation. On the Republic Day, the President of India unfurls the national flag in the national capital New Delhi with the Governors and Lieutenant Governors unfurling the flag at the respective states and union territories.\n\nThe President's address to the nation is a significant event on Republic Day. The President recalls the sacrifices made by the freedom fighters and the contribution of the people of India towards the making of the Constitution. The President also highlights the achievements of the government and the challenges that lie ahead.\n\nThe national flag is a symbol of India's independence and sovereignty. It is a rectangular flag with three horizontal stripes of saffron, white, and green, and a blue chakra in the center. The flag is a reminder of the country's rich cultural heritage and its commitment to the principles of democracy and secularism.\n\n**Parade**\n\nThe main Republic Day celebrations are held in New Delhi, at the Kartavya Path, a ceremonial boulevard that runs from Rashtrapati Bhavan on Raisina Hill through India Gate. The event is hosted by the President of India with ceremonious parades and cultural events.\n\nThe Delhi Republic Day parade is one of the largest and most spectacular parades in the world. The parade is organized by the Ministry of Defence, and it features various units of the army, navy, air force, para-military, and police forces. The parade is a celebration of India's military might and its rich cultural heritage.\n\nThe President who is the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Armed Forces, takes the salute from various units of the army, navy, air force, para-military, and police forces. The parade is a display of India's military strength and its commitment to the principles of democracy and secularism.\n\n**Beating Retreat**\n\nThe Beating Retreat ceremony, conducted on the evening of 29 January marks the end of Republic day festivities. It is performed by the bands of the three wings of the Indian armed forces at Vijay Chowk. The President of India is escorted by the President's Bodyguard and post a ceremonial salute.\n\nThe Beating Retreat ceremony is a musical performance that marks the end of the Republic Day celebrations. The ceremony features the bands of the army, navy, and air force, performing various military tunes and popular songs. The ceremony is a display of India's rich cultural heritage and its commitment to the principles of democracy and secularism.\n\nThe Indian National Anthem, Jana Gana Mana is played during the ceremony, followed by military bands playing popular tunes like Abide With Me and Saare Jahan Se Achcha. The ceremony is a celebration of India's independence and its rich cultural heritage.\n\n**Awards**\n\nOn the eve of Republic Day, the President of India distributes various civilian Padma Awards. These were instituted in the year 1954 and are awarded in three categories in decreasing order of precedence.\n\nThe Padma Awards are the highest civilian honors in India. They are awarded to individuals who have made significant contributions in the fields of art, literature, science, and public service. The awards are a recognition of the outstanding achievements of individuals who have made a significant impact on society.\n\nThe Padma Awards are awarded in three categories: Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri. The Padma Vibhushan is the highest civilian honor, followed by the Padma Bhushan and the Padma Shri.\n\n**Gallery**\n\nThe Republic Day celebrations are a grand affair, with various cultural events and performances taking place across the country.

franchise based in San Francisco, and one of the first major league professional sports teams based on the Pacific Coast [22] In 1946, the team joined the Los Angeles Dons of the AAFC and the Los Angeles Rams of the rival National Football League as the first three teams playing a \"big four\"-sport in the Western United States, [22] eventually becoming part of the NFL themselves in 1950.\n\n\nMorabito family era (1946–1976)\nThe San Francisco 49ers, an original member of the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC), were the first major league professional sports franchise based in San Francisco, and one of the first major league professional sports teams based on the Pacific Coast [22] In 1946, the team joined the Los Angeles Dons of the AAFC and the Los Angeles Rams of the rival National Football League as the first three teams playing a \"big four\"-sport in the Western United States, [22] eventually becoming part of the NFL themselves in 1950.\n\n\nBuck Shaw years (1946–1954)\nThe San Francisco 49ers, an original member of the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC), were the first major league professional sports franchise based in San Francisco, and one of the first major league professional sports teams based on the Pacific Coast [22] In 1946, the team joined the Los Angeles Dons of the AAFC and the Los Angeles Rams of the rival National Football League as the first three teams playing a \"big four\"-sport in the Western United States, [22] eventually becoming part of the NFL themselves in 1950.\n\n\nDick Nolan years (1968–1975)\nFor the 1968 season, the 49ers hired Dick Nolan, who had been Tom Landry's defensive coordinator with the Dallas Cowboys, as their head coach [31] Nolan's first two seasons with the 49ers had gone much the same as the previous decade, with the 49ers going 7–6–1 and 4–8–2 [32]\n\n\nEdward DeBartolo era (1977–1999)\nLou Spadia retired from the 49ers in 1977 upon the team's sale to the DeBartolo Family The team was sold to Edward J DeBartolo Jr in March 1977, and despite finishing the season with a winning record of 8–6, Clark was fired after just one season by newly hired general manager Joe Thomas, who oversaw the worst stretch of football in the team's history [32]\n\n\nBill Walsh years (1979–1988)\nBill Walsh was hired to be the 49ers head coach in the 1978 off-season [39] Walsh was a disciple of Paul Brown, and served as Brown's offensive coordinator with the Cincinnati Bengals from 1968 to 1975 However, Brown did not appoint him as his successor upon his retirement, choosing another assistant, former 49ers center Bill \"Tiger\" Johnson Walsh was hired by Stanford University in 1977 He went 17–7 in two seasons for the Cardinal before being hired by the 49ers in 1979 [40]\n\n\nSuper Bowl XVI champions (1981)\nWith the offense playing well consistently, Walsh and the 49ers focused on overhauling the defense in 1981 Walsh took the highly unusual step of overhauling his entire secondary with rookies and untested players, bringing on board Ronnie Lott, Eric Wright and Carlton Williamson and giving Dwight Hicks a prominent role He also acquired veteran linebacker Jack \"Hacksaw\" Reynolds and veteran defensive end and sack specialist Fred Dean These additions, when added to existing defensive mainstays like Keena Turner, turned the 49ers into an offensively and defensively balanced, dominant team After a 1–2 start, the 49ers won all but one of their remaining games to finish with a 13–3 record; at this time, it was the team's best regular-season win–loss record Dean made the Pro Bowl, as did Lott and Hicks Led by Montana, the unusual offense was centered on the short passing game, which Walsh used as ball control Dwight Clark and Freddie Solomon had excellent years receiving; Clark as the possession receiver, and Solomon as more of a deep threat The 49ers' running game, however, was among the weakest in the league Ricky Patton led the 49ers with only 543 yards rushing The 49ers' most valuable running back, however, might have been Earl Cooper, whose strength was as a pass catching back The 49ers faced the New York Giants in the divisional playoffs and won, 38–24 This set up an NFC championship game match-up with the Dallas Cowboys, whom the 49ers historically could not beat during their playoff runs in the early 1970s The 49ers played the Cowboys tough, but the Cowboys forced six turnovers and held the lead late The 49ers were down 27–21 and on their own 11-yard line with 4:54 remaining As Montana had done for Notre Dame and the 49ers so many times, he led the 49ers on a sustained final 89-yard drive to the Cowboys' 6-yard line On a 3rd-and-3 play, with his primary receiver covered, Montana rolled right and threw the ball off balance to Dwight Clark, who leaped in the end zone and caught the ball to tie the game at 27 (\"The Catch\"), with the extra point giving the 49ers the lead The Cowboys had one last chance to win On the first play of the next possession, Cowboys receiver Drew Pearson caught a pass from Danny White and reached midfield before he was pulled down by the jersey at the 49ers' 44-yard line by cornerback Eric Wright, who prevented a winning touchdown On the next play, White was sacked by Lawrence Pillers and fumbled the ball, which was recovered by Jim Stuckey, giving the 49ers the win and a trip to their first-ever Super Bowl, against the Cincinnati Bengals, who were also in their first Super Bowl In Super Bowl XVI The 49ers took a 20–0 halftime lead and held on to win 26–21 behind kicker Ray Wersching's four field goals and a key defensive stand In the '81 season, the defense had been a significant reason for the team's success, despite hiding in the shadow of the then-innovative offense Montana won MVP honors mostly on the strength of leading the 49ers on a 92-yard, 12-play drive culminating in a touchdown pass to Earl Cooper The 49ers completed one of the most dramatic and complete turnarounds in NFL history, going from a 2–14 season and a 6–10 season to a Super Bowl championship [44]\n\n\nSuper Bowl XIX champions (1984)\nIn 1984, the 49ers had one of the greatest seasons in team history by finishing the regular season 15–1, setting the record for most regular-season wins that was later equaled by the 1985 Chicago Bears, the 1998 Minnesota Vikings, the 2004 Pittsburgh Steelers, the 2011 Green Bay Packers and finally broken by the 2007 New England Patriots (with 16 regular-season victories) Their 18 wins overall is also still a record, tied by the 1985 Bears and the 2007 New England Patriots (who won 18 straight, but lost Super Bowl XLII to the New York Giants) The 49ers' only defeat in the 1984 season was a 20–17 loss to the Steelers; a late field goal attempt in that game by San Francisco kicker Ray Wersching went off the uprights and was no good In the playoffs, they beat the New York Giants 21–10, shut out the Chicago Bears 23–0 in the NFC championship, and in Super Bowl XIX the 49ers shut down a record-setting year by NFL MVP Dan Marino (and his speedy receivers Mark Clayton and Mark Duper), beating the Miami Dolphins 38–16 Their entire defensive backfield (Ronnie Lott, Eric Wright, Dwight Hicks, and Carlton Williamson) was elected to the Pro Bowl—an NFL first.\n\n\nSuper Bowl XXIII champions (1988)\nDuring the off-season, a quarterback controversy between Joe Montana and Steve Young had begun after Montana's poor performance in the playoffs the previous year Many speculated that the 1988 season would be his last year with the team In the 1988 NFL season, the 49ers struggled to start the season; Walsh would constantly switch QBs between Montana (who suffered an elbow injury week 1 that would linger for most of the season) and Young At one point, they were 6–5 and the team was in danger of missing the playoffs Before week 11, Ronnie Lott called a players-only meeting; after the meeting, the team came together and defeated the defending Super Bowl champion Washington Redskins in a Monday night game, Montana had fully recovered from his injury and retook the starting quarterback job as the team eventually finished the season at 10–6 [52] They gained a measure of revenge by routing the Minnesota Vikings 34–9 in the divisional playoffs [53] The 49ers then traveled to Chicago's Soldier Field for the NFC championship against the Chicago Bears, where the wind chill factor at game time was −26° [54] However, despite the weather, Joe Montana picked apart the Bears' top-rated defense by scoring three touchdowns as the 49ers dominated the Bears with a 28–3 victory, earning the team's third trip to the Super Bowl, to go against the Cincinnati Bengals [55] In Super Bowl XXIII, despite numerous trips deep into Cincinnati territory by the 49ers, the game was tied 3–3 at halftime Early in the fourth quarter, Montana tied the score at 13; however, Cincinnati regained the lead on a Jim Breech field goal to put the Bengals ahead 16–13 with just over three minutes left on the clock Following the kickoff, and a holding penalty, the 49ers took over on their 8-yard line with 3:08 left on the clock Joe Montana began the final drive by stepping into the huddle and remarking to offensive tackle Harris Barton, during a television timeout, \"hey, there's John Candy\", as he pointed to the stands on the other side of the field [56] His calm demeanor reassured the 49ers, and he then engineered what some consider the greatest drive in Super Bowl history, as he drove the team 92 yards for the winning touchdown on a pass to John Taylor with only 34 seconds left, as they captured their third Super Bowl championship with a score of 20–16 [57] Jerry Rice was named Super Bowl MVP [56]\n\n\nGeorge Seifert years (1989–1996)\nAfter Super Bowl XXIII, Bill Walsh retired as head coach; his defensive coordinator and handpicked successor, George Seifert, took over as head coach [58]\n\n\nSuper Bowl XXIV champions (1989)\nIn the 1989 NFL season, Joe Montana threw for 3,521 yards and 26 touchdowns, with only 8 interceptions, giving him a 112.4 quarterback rating, which was then the highest single-season passer rating in NFL history, and was named NFL Most Valuable Player [59] [60] [61] Jerry Rice, in his fifth year in the league, continued to dominate; he led the league with almost 1,490 receiving yards, and 17 touchdowns [62] The 49ers clinched their fourth straight division title, beating the Los Angeles Rams 30–27 after a dramatic second-half comeback; they finished 14–2, gaining home-field advantage throughout the playoffs Their two losses were by a combined five points [63]\n\n\nSuper Bowl XXIX champions (1994)\nIn 1994, the team spent large amounts of money on the addition of several star free agents from other teams, including Ken Norton Jr., Gary Plummer, Rickey Jackson, Bart Oates, Richard Dent, Charles Mann and Deion Sanders [82] Additionally, several rookie players made key contributions to the team, some becoming season-long starters such as defensive tackle Bryant Young, fullback William Floyd, and linebacker Lee Woodall Due to injuries to the offensive line, the 49ers had some tough times early in the season, including a 40–8 home loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, and a 24–17 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, led by former 49ers quarterback Joe Montana Following the Eagles game, a poll conducted on local sports radio station KNBR showed that an overwhelming majority of 49er fans wanted head coach George Seifert fired The game against the Eagles was a turning point for the 49ers despite the lopsided score Quarterback Steve Young was benched in the 3rd quarter and was later seen on the sidelines, shouting profanities at Seifert The following week in Detroit, the 49ers trailed the Lions 7–0 After throwing a pass, Young was hit, picked up, and driven into the ground by three Lions defenders He crawled most of the way off of the field before refusing help from the trainers as he limped the remaining way off the field He returned to the field two plays later (NFL rules state that after trainers attend to an injured player, that player must leave the field for at least one play) to lead the 49ers to a 27–21 victory The team rallied around Young to win 10 straight games, including a 21–14 victory over the two-time defending Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys During that span the 49ers' average margin of victory was nearly 20 points per game, a sustained dominance not seen since the 1985 Chicago Bears Despite scoring only 8 points in one game and 14 in another, the 49ers set a new record for total regular-season and post-season combined points scored That record was later broken by the New England Patriots in 2007 (the 1998 Minnesota Vikings scored 556 regular-season points, but only 68 postseason points, for a total of 624 points, while the 1994 49ers scored 495 regular-season points and 131 postseason points for a total of 626, the second-highest mark in NFL history) Even after those initial rough spots early in the season, the 49ers finished the season 13–3 and with home-field advantage throughout the playoffs [83] In their first game, they easily defeated the Chicago Bears, 44–15, setting up the third straight 49ers–Cowboys NFC championship game [84] The 49ers took advantage of three early Cowboys turnovers, taking a 21–0 lead in the first quarter Taking a 31–14 lead into halftime after a perfect 29-yard pass from Young to Rice in the closing seconds, the game appeared to be far out of reach for the Cowboys But a 49er fumble on the opening kick of the 3rd quarter led to a Cowboy score, cutting the lead to 31–21 Later, the 49ers responded with a Young touchdown run, making it 38–21, before the Cowboys scored another touchdown in the final minutes for a final score of 38–28 [85] The convincing win qualified the 49ers for their fifth Super Bowl appearance, and the first to be played by two teams from California The 49ers steamrolled the San Diego Chargers 49–26 behind Young's record-setting 6 touchdown passes in Super Bowl XXIX, at the time becoming the first team to win a record five Super Bowls [86] Finally establishing himself as a worthy successor to Joe Montana, Young was named the game's MVP [87] The 49ers' run of five Super Bowl wins in 14 seasons (1981–1994) solidified them alongside the 1960s Vince Lombardi Green Bay Packers and 1970s Chuck Knoll Pittsburgh Steelers as one of the modern NFL's great dynasties [88]\n\n\nYork family era (2000–present)\nDeBartolo returned from his suspension in 1999, but a series of lawsuits over control of the family's vast holdings led him to surrender controlling interest to the Yorks as part of a 2000 settlement Denise York became chair of the board, while John York became CEO On the field, the 1999 49ers got off to a 3–1 start, then in a nationally televised Monday Night Football game against the Arizona Cardinals, Steve Young suffered a blindside hit from cornerback Aeneas Williams that knocked him out of the game and eventually convinced him to retire [105] At the time it was believed the severe hit ended his career but Young later said in interviews he could have come back to play another season or two After meeting with then-general manager Bill Walsh and being told about how the salary cap troubles would make the team non-competitive, Young chose to retire rather than risk his long-term health further for a likely losing club Without their future Hall of Famer, 29-year-old rookie Jeff Garcia took over as starting quarterback, but he would be benched for poor performances in favor of Steve Stenstrom [106] Garcia would be reinstated as the starting quarterback and in the final 5 games of the regular season The 49ers lost 11 of their last 12 games and suffered their first losing season in a non-strike year since 1980, which was also the last time that the 49ers did not win at least ten or more games in a season [107] Bobb McKittrick, 49ers offensive line coach since 1979, also died of cancer following the 1999 season [108]\n\n\nJim Harbaugh years (2011–2014)\nOn January 4, 2011, Jed York promoted interim General Manager Trent Baalke to be the permanent general manager Baalke had taken over the role after former general manager Scot McCloughan was relieved of his duties the year before Two days later, on January 7, 2011, former head coach of Stanford University Jim Harbaugh was named the 49ers new head coach [162] In the 2011 NFL draft, the 49ers selected defensive end/linebacker Aldon Smith from the University of Missouri with the seventh pick of the first round The 49ers also selected quarterback Colin Kaepernick from the University of Nevada, Reno with the 36th overall pick in the second round [163]\n\n\nKyle Shanahan years (2017–present)\nAfter hiring John Lynch as general manager and Kyle Shanahan as head coach, the 49ers started the 2017 season with nine consecutive losses [208] [209] During this time, they traded for New England Patriots backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo [210] After a win over the New York Giants and a loss to the Seattle Seahawks, Garoppolo was named the starter after rookie C J Beathard suffered an injury [211] The 49ers won their last five games with Garoppolo at the helm and finished the season 6–10 After the season, the 49ers signed Garoppolo to a five-year, $137.5 million contract extension This made him the highest-paid player in NFL history on a per-year basis at the time [212] During the third-week matchup between the 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs, Jimmy Garoppolo tore his ACL, and was ruled out for the rest of the 2018 season [213] The 49ers struggled to a 4–12 record in the 2018 season [214]\n\n\nChampionships\nThe 49ers have won five Super Bowls, tied for most of any NFC team, their first three under Bill Walsh Walsh retired after winning his third in 1988, but first-year head coach George Seifert did not miss a beat, winning the Super Bowl in his first year in 1989 He would also win one more in 1994 [245] [246]\n\n\nSuper Bowls\nThe 49ers have won five Super Bowls,

plaid pants and a red shirt, jumping in midair with his hat falling off, and firing pistols in each hand: one nearly shooting his foot, and the other pistol forming the word \"Forty-Niners\" from its smoke [260] An alternate logo with a shield-shaped crest formed from the number \"49\", with a football in the upper right quadrant and \"SF\" in the lower-left quadrant was created in 1965 and used for marketing purposes until 1972 From 1962, the 49ers' logo has been the iconic \"SF\" within the center of a red oval; throughout the years the logo has had minor modifications, such as a black outlining on the intertwined \"SF\" that was added in 1989 and a gold trimming inside the oval that was added in 1996.\n\n\nLogos and uniforms\nThe original 49ers logo was a mustached 49er gold miner

combinations quite often throughout their history From the team's inception in 1946, they wore dark or cardinal red, switching to scarlet red jerseys and gold pants for the 1948 season, with a gold helmet with one red stripe, with solid red socks and pants with no stripes Entering the 1949 season, the first in the NFL, the 49ers adopted three stripes to their red jerseys, wearing gold helmets and pants, with no stripes and red socks with three white stripes In the 1953, '54, and '55 seasons, the 49ers wore red helmets with a gold stripe in the middle, with silver pants with one single stripe of red The socks also added the three stripes similar to the jersey's 1955 was also unique in that the 49ers wore white pants with a black stripe bounded by two red stripes, and shadow drop numbers on their red jerseys, with black shadow drop borders on the white numerals The following season, 1956, the team wore white helmets with no stripes, and white pants with a red stripe In 1957 the 49ers wore red jerseys, a gold helmet with no stripes, and gold pants with no stripes; for the first time the 49ers wore white on the road, as dictated by the NFL for all teams, to have at least one team wearing a light-colored jersey during games The first white jersey had two red stripes with a gold in the middle, as was their road socks: white, with two red stripes and gold in the middle San Francisco wore red and gold in 1958 as well, with their white jersey having a single shoulder loop stripe, as well as adding TV numbers to the sleeves of their home and away jerseys And in contrast to the socks at home, red with three red stripes, the away socks were solid red In 1959 the team switched to red and platinum gold (looking more like silver), and for the next several years afterwards, with their white jerseys having double shoulder loop stripes (mimicking UCLA's), but continuing with the three white stripes on the sleeves above the elbow and below the TV numbers, with the red home jerseys In 1960, the team added \"Northwestern\" red stripes to their helmets (a thicker middle stripe bordered by two thinner stripes), and that changed in 1962, with the addition of the helmet design the team has mostly worn since: white stripe bounded by two red, with the red oval and SF logo on the sides of the helmet In 1964 the team's colors then changed again All silver elements were changed to what was called \"49er Gold;\" helmets were gold New beige-gold pants with a red-white-red tri-stripe in the same style as the helmet were introduced Uniform's basic design would be worn for practically the next 30 seasons with only some minor changes and adjustments, such as a gradual change over from sans-serif to serifed block numerals from 1970 to 1974 and a switch from thin stripes to a very thick pant striping in 1976 (during which white jerseys were also worn at home for most of that season) The uniform ensemble of red and white jerseys, and beige-gold pants with thick striping were worn until 1995 with a few minor changes During the 1994 season, many NFL teams wore \"throwback uniforms\" on occasional games to celebrate the NFL's 75th anniversary (a corresponding diamond-shaped 75th Anniversary patch was also worn by all teams)  The 49ers chose to wear a version of their 1955 uniforms as their throwbacks, with simpler sans-serif block numerals that were outlined and shadowed in black with White pants with thinner red-black-red striping were also worn, along with the old striped red socks The regular 1989–95 design gold helmet was worn with this uniform, as there was no logo on the 1955 helmet.\n\n\nCulture\nThe 49ers official cheerleading squad is called the Gold Rush [269]\nStarted in the early 1980s, the first squad consisted of 14 dancers

Niner Gang, or utilizing the acronym FTTB an abbreviation of Faithful To The Bay A common chant utilized by the fans in recent years is the chant of \"Bang! Bang! Niner Gang!\" popularized by Bay Area rapper E-40 in 2019 [274] [275]\n\n\nRivalries\nThe rivalry between the Los Angeles Rams and the San Francisco 49ers is considered by many to be one of the greatest NFL rivalries ever, placing No 8 on Sports Illustrated's \"Top 10 NFL Rivalries of All Time\" list, compiled in 2008 [276] After the Rams moved to St Louis, Roger Craig stated in Tales from the San Francisco 49ers Sideline that the Rams would always remain the team's arch-rival, regardless of location [277] The Rams are the only team to have played the 49ers twice every season for the last 58 seasons [278] to combine for more than 100 regular season games; the all-time regular season lead is held by the 49ers 72–67–3 [279] The rivalry regained geographic animosity following their return to Los Angeles in 2016 The rivalry has also regrown a fierce element of animosity between fans, [280] [281] coaches, [282] and players alike [283] [284] [285] [286] The two teams have met twice in the postseason; in the NFC Championship Game The first meeting came on January 14, 1990, when the 49ers crushed the Rams 30–3 at Candlestick Park to advance to the team's historic victory in Super Bowl XXIV [287] Both teams later met again on January 30, 2022, when the Rams rallied from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter to beat the 49ers 20–17 at SoFi Stadium, ending a 6-game loss-streak to the 49ers and ultimately proceeding to win Super Bowl LVI [288]\n\n\nDivisional\nThe rivalry between the Los Angeles Rams and the San Francisco 49ers is considered by many to be one of the greatest

exchange of heated regular season matchups following the NFL's realignment in 2002 that relocated both teams into the same division Prior to 2002, the teams played each other almost every season during the pre-season, but only every three years during the regular season as part of the league scheduling algorithm The rivalry began to intensify after the 49ers hired Jim Harbaugh out of Stanford in 2011, as he and Seahawks and former USC head coach Pete Carroll had been involved in a lengthy feud The matchups regularly grew in intensity through the 2010s, culminating in the two teams meeting in the 2013 NFC Championship which saw Seattle advance and ultimately on to win Super Bowl XLVIII [289] As of the 2023 season, the Seahawks lead the all-time series 30–22 [290]\n\n\nArizona Cardinals\nThough the 49ers and Cardinals initially met in 1951 and would meet occasionally until 2000, this would not develop into a full-fledged rivalry until both teams were placed in the NFC West division in 2002 Longtime-Quarterback Steve Young suffered a career-ending concussion in a game against the Cardinals on September 27, 1999, after taking a brutal hit from Arizona cornerback Aeneas Williams [291] [292] While still a close rivalry in wins; it is often lopsided on both ends After the 49ers won nine of ten meetings between 2009 and 2013, the Cardinals won eight straight meetings between 2014 and 2018 San Francisco currently leads the series 35–29 [293]\n\n\nConference\nThe Green Bay Packers rivalry emerged in the mid-1990s when the Packers upset the 49ers in the 1995 NFC Divisional game at Candlestick Park, ending any chance of a Super Bowl repeat From that point, the Packers beat the 49ers four more times including two post-season games San Francisco was finally able to exact revenge in the 1998 NFC Wild Card round, a game that is remembered for a 25-yard game-winning touchdown reception by Terrell Owens off a Steve Young pass (referred to by some as \"The Catch II\"), lifting the 49ers over the Packers 30–27 Since that game, the Packers had beaten the 49ers eight straight times including once in the 2001 post-season, a streak that came to an end in the 2012 season when the 49ers beat the Packers in Lambeau Field week 1 for the first time since 1990, and again in the NFC Divisional game that same season In the 2019 season the 49ers and Packers met in the 2020 NFC Championship game at Levi's Stadium where the 49ers won 37–20, but went on to lose Super Bowl LIV to the Kansas City Chiefs The Packers also proceeded to lose to the 49ers in the Divisional Round in the 2021–2022 season The 49ers trail the all-time series with a record of 32–37–1, though San Francisco holds a 6–4 lead in the postseason, winning the last five meetings [294]\n\n\nGreen Bay

championship games, and again in the 1972 Divisional Playoff Game The 1981 NFC championship game in San Francisco, which saw the 49ers' Joe Montana complete a game-winning pass to Dwight Clark in the final minute (now known as The Catch), is one of the most famous games in NFL history The rivalry became even more intense during the 1992–1994 seasons San Francisco and Dallas faced each other in the NFC championship game three separate times Dallas won the first two match-ups, and San Francisco won the third In each of these pivotal match-ups, the game's victor went on to win the Super Bowl Both the Cowboys and the 49ers are third all-time in Super Bowl victories to the Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots with five each The 49ers–Cowboys rivalry is also part of the larger cultural rivalry between California and Texas In recent years, this once-great rivalry has greatly softened, with the struggles of both the Cowboys and 49ers However, in its prime especially in the 1990s, this rivalry was a very bitter one as both teams were the class of the NFL during this time In what was believed to be the greatest upset in the team's rivalry in the modern era, the 49ers upset the Cowboys in the 2021 Wild Card Round.\nThe 2022 49ers would go on to continue their winning streak against the Cowboys winning the divisional round game 19–12 The Cowboys' loss to the 49ers was their seventh straight in the divisional round, which is the longest streak in the second round of the NFL playoffs In Week 5 of 2023–24 season, the 49ers beat the Cowboys 42–10, making it the largest win margin for the 49ers in the history of the rivalry The 49ers lead the all-time series between the two including playoffs 20–19–1 [295]\n\n\nNew York Giants\nThe New York Giants have the most playoff meetings versus the 49ers (eight) The playoff series is currently tied at four wins a piece, and in five of their eight meetings, the winning team has gone on to win the Super Bowl This rivalry is rooted in the 1980s when both teams were on the rise In the first two playoff meetings between these two teams, the Joe Montana-led 49ers won both meetings, 38–24 in 1981 and 21–10 in 1984 both in the divisional round at Candlestick Park; the 49ers went on to win their first two Super Bowl championships both seasons The Giants won the next three playoff meetings, which included a 49–3 rout at Giants Stadium in 1986, and the 1990 NFC championship, where they upset the 49ers 15–13, ruining the 49ers hopes of a Super Bowl three-peat after Roger Craig lost a fumble late in the fourth quarter and let the Giants score on a last-second field goal Giants also went on to win their first two Super Bowl championships both seasons The 49ers defeated the Giants 44–3 in 1993 in the divisional round [296]  In the 2002 NFC wildcard game, the Giants were ahead 38–14 late in the third quarter; however, the 49ers came back from the 24-point deficit to beat the Giants with a 39–38 victory The teams met again in the 2011 NFC championship at Candlestick Park, and just like the 1990 NFC championship, it was a low-scoring game; the Giants won the game on a Lawrence Tynes 31-yard field goal in overtime, 20–17 In an eerie similarity to Roger Craig's fumble 21 years earlier, Kyle Williams fumbled a punt in the crucial minutes of the game, and just like the last two times, the Giants beat the 49ers in the playoffs, they went on to win the Super Bowl  San Francisco leads the all-time series 22–21 [297]\n\n\nHistoric\nThe Atlanta Falcons were also division rivals with the 49ers until the Falcons moved to the NFC South in 2002 after the realignment [120]Just like the Saints, the 49ers had dominated the Falcons when they played in the NFC West, but the Falcons won their first four games (spanning nine seasons) against the 49ers since moving to the NFC South Both teams met in the divisional round of the 1998 playoffs Garrison Hearst suffered an ankle break after his foot was caught in the Georgia Dome turf and twisted severely as he tried to spin away from Falcons' defensive end Chuck Smith on the first play from scrimmage; the 49ers lost that game 20–18 They met in the 2012 NFC championship, in which the 49ers, led by quarterback Colin Kaepernick, defeated the top-seeded Falcons in Atlanta by a score of 28–24 The next year, the Falcons played against the 49ers in the final home game at Candlestick Park ever The game ended in a dramatic interception return for a touchdown by 49ers linebacker NaVorro Bowman, known as \"The Pick at the 'Stick\" [298] [299] The 49ers maintain an overall 47–32–1 against the Falcons, but are tied 1–1 in the postseason [300]\n\n\nAtlanta Falcons\nThe Atlanta Falcons were also division rivals with the 49ers until the Falcons moved to

47–32–1 against the Falcons, but are tied 1–1 in the postseason [300]\n\n\nOakland Raiders\nThe Oakland Raiders were the 49ers' geographic rivals when the Raiders were located in Oakland As a result, games between the two were referred to as the \"Battle of the Bay\" [301] The first exhibition game played in 1967, ended with the NFL 49ers defeating the AFL Raiders 13–10 After the 1970 merger, the 49ers won in Oakland 38–7 The rivalry still remained heated when the Raiders moved to Los Angeles, leaving many Raider fans in Northern California bitter over the move, and some of them becoming 49er fans, added with the antagonism between Northern and Southern California The Raiders notably upset the defending Super Bowl champion 49ers in San Francisco in 1982, winning 23–17  In addition, both teams have shared a number of players, most notably Jim Plunkett, Jerry Rice, Ronnie Lott, Michael Crabtree, Tom Rathman, and Charlie Garner [302]\n\n\nCleveland Browns\nIn the AAFC, the only other competitive team other than the 49ers was the Cleveland Browns, who they played twice each of the four years the league was in service; Cleveland lost four games in the AAFC, and San Francisco was responsible for two of them, including the one that broke a 29-game streak where Cleveland did not lose a game The final game in AAFC history matched the two for the AAFC Championship, which Cleveland won 21–7 The rivalry did not last into the NFL years, particularly after the teams were placed in opposite conferences in 1970  The rivalry has turned into a friendly relationship as many 49ers personnel helped the Browns relaunch in 1999, specifically former 49ers president and CEO Carmen Policy and vice president/director of football operations Dwight Clark, who were hired by the expansion Browns in the same roles  In addition, 49ers owners John York and Denise DeBartolo York reside in Youngstown, 60 miles (97 km) southeast of Cleveland Long-time Browns placekicker and fan favorite Phil Dawson and backup quarterback Colt McCoy signed with the 49ers in 2014 As of the 2023 season, the Browns lead the all-time series 20–10 [304]\n\n\nSeason-by-season records\nThis is a partial list of

(AAFC), were the first major league professional sports franchise based in San Francisco, and one of the first major league professional sports teams based on the Pacific Coast [22] In 1946, the team

themselves in 1950.\n\n\nDick Nolan years (1968–1975)\nFor the 1968 season, the 49ers hired Dick Nolan, who had been Tom Landry's defensive coordinator with the Dallas Cowboys, as their head coach [31] Nolan's first two seasons with the 49ers had gone much the same as the previous decade, with the 49ers going 7–6–1 and 4–8–2 [32]\n\n\nEdward DeBartolo era (1977–1999)\nLou Spadia retired from the 49ers in 1977 upon the team's sale to the DeBartolo Family The team was sold to Edward J DeBartolo Jr in March 1977, and despite finishing the season with a winning record of 8–6, Clark was fired after just one season by newly hired general manager Joe Thomas, who oversaw the worst stretch of football in the team's history [32]\n\n\nBill Walsh years (1979–1988)\nBill Walsh was hired to be the 49ers head coach in the 1978 off-season [39] Walsh was a disciple of Paul Brown, and served as Brown's offensive coordinator with the Cincinnati Bengals from 1968 to 1975 However, Brown did not appoint him as his successor upon his retirement, choosing another assistant, former 49ers center Bill \"Tiger\" Johnson Walsh was hired by Stanford University in 1977 He went 17–7 in two seasons for the Cardinal before being hired by the 49ers in 1979 [40]\n\n\nSuper Bowl XVI champions (1981)\nWith the offense playing well consistently, Walsh and the 49ers focused on overhauling the defense in 1981 Walsh took the highly unusual step of overhauling his entire secondary with rookies and untested players, bringing on board Ronnie Lott, Eric Wright and Carlton Williamson and giving Dwight Hicks a prominent role He also acquired veteran linebacker Jack \"Hacksaw\" Reynolds and veteran defensive end and sack specialist Fred Dean These additions, when added to existing defensive mainstays like Keena Turner, turned the 49ers into an offensively and defensively balanced, dominant team After a 1–2 start, the 49ers won all but one of their remaining games to finish with a 13–3 record; at this time, it was the team's best regular-season win–loss record Dean made the Pro Bowl, as did Lott and Hicks Led by Montana, the unusual offense was centered on the short passing game, which Walsh used as ball control Dwight Clark and Freddie Solomon had excellent years receiving; Clark as the possession receiver, and Solomon as more of a deep threat The 49ers' running game, however, was among the weakest in the league Ricky Patton led the 49ers with only 543 yards rushing The 49ers' most valuable running back, however, might have been Earl Cooper, whose strength was as a pass catching back The 49ers faced the New York Giants in the divisional playoffs and won, 38–24 This set up an NFC championship game match-up with the Dallas Cowboys, whom the 49ers historically could not beat during their playoff runs in the early 1970s The 49ers played the Cowboys tough, but the Cowboys forced six turnovers and held the lead late The 49ers were down 27–21 and on their own 11-yard line with 4:54 remaining As Montana had done for Notre Dame and the 49ers so many times, he led the 49ers on a sustained final 89-yard drive to the Cowboys' 6-yard line On a 3rd-and-3 play, with his primary receiver covered, Montana rolled right and threw the ball off balance to Dwight Clark, who leaped in the end zone and caught the ball to tie the game at 27 (\"The Catch\"), with the extra point giving the 49ers the lead The Cowboys had one last chance to win On the first play of the next possession, Cowboys receiver Drew Pearson caught a pass from Danny White and reached midfield before he was pulled down by the jersey at the 49ers' 44-yard line by cornerback Eric Wright, who prevented a winning touchdown On the next play, White was sacked by Lawrence Pillers and fumbled the ball, which was recovered by Jim Stuckey, giving the 49ers the win and a trip to their first-ever Super Bowl, against the Cincinnati Bengals, who were also in their first Super Bowl In Super Bowl XVI The 49ers took a 20–0 halftime lead and held on to win 26–21 behind kicker Ray Wersching's four field goals and a key defensive stand In the '81 season, the defense had been a significant reason for the team's success, despite hiding in the shadow of the then-innovative offense Montana won MVP honors mostly on the strength of leading the 49ers on a 92-yard, 12-play drive culminating in a touchdown pass to Earl Cooper The 49ers completed one of the most dramatic and complete turnarounds in NFL history, going from a 2–14 season and a 6–10 season to a Super Bowl championship [44]\n\n\nSuper Bowl XIX champions (1984)\nIn 1984, the 49ers had one of the greatest seasons in team history by finishing the regular season 15–1, setting the record for most regular-season wins that was later equaled by the 1985 Chicago Bears, the 1998 Minnesota Vikings, the 2004 Pittsburgh Steelers, the 2011 Green Bay Packers and finally broken by the 2007 New England Patriots (with 16 regular-season victories) Their 18 wins overall is also still a record, tied by the 1985 Bears and the 2007 New England Patriots (who won 18 straight, but lost Super Bowl XLII to the New York Giants) The 49ers' only defeat in the 1984 season was a 20–17 loss to the Steelers; a late field goal attempt in that game by San Francisco kicker Ray Wersching went off the uprights and was no good In the playoffs, they beat the New York Giants 21–10, shut out the Chicago Bears 23–0 in the NFC championship, and in Super Bowl XIX the 49ers shut down a record-setting year by NFL MVP Dan Marino (and his speedy receivers Mark Clayton and Mark Duper), beating the Miami Dolphins 38–16 Their entire defensive backfield (Ronnie Lott, Eric Wright, Dwight Hicks, and Carlton Williamson) was elected to the Pro Bowl—an NFL first.\n\n\nSuper Bowl XXIII champions (1988)\nDuring the off-season, a quarterback controversy between Joe Montana and Steve Young had begun after Montana's poor performance in the playoffs the previous year Many speculated that the 1988 season would be his last year with the team In the 1988 NFL season, the 49ers struggled to start the season; Walsh would constantly switch QBs between Montana (who suffered an elbow injury week 1 that would linger for most of the season) and Young At one point, they were 6–5 and the team was in danger of missing the playoffs Before week 11, Ronnie Lott called a players-only meeting; after the meeting, the team came together and defeated the defending Super Bowl champion Washington Redskins in a Monday night game, Montana had fully recovered from his injury and retook the starting quarterback job as the team eventually finished the season at 10–6 [52] They gained a measure of revenge by routing the Minnesota Vikings 34–9 in the divisional playoffs [53] The 49ers then traveled to Chicago's Soldier Field for the NFC championship against the Chicago Bears, where the wind chill factor at game time was −26° [54] However, despite the weather, Joe Montana picked apart the Bears' top-rated defense by scoring three touchdowns as the 49ers dominated the Bears with a 28–3 victory, earning the team's third trip to the Super Bowl, to go against the Cincinnati Bengals [55] In Super Bowl XXIII, despite numerous trips deep into Cincinnati territory by the 49ers, the game was tied 3–3 at halftime Early in the fourth quarter, Montana tied the score at 13; however, Cincinnati regained the lead on a Jim Breech field goal to put the Bengals ahead 16–13 with just over three minutes left on the clock Following the kickoff, and a holding penalty, the 49ers took over on their 8-yard line with 3:08 left on the clock Joe Montana began the final drive by stepping into the huddle and remarking to offensive tackle Harris Barton, during a television timeout, \"hey, there's John Candy\", as he pointed to the stands on the other side of the field [56] His calm demeanor reassured the 49ers, and he then engineered what some consider the greatest drive in Super Bowl history, as he drove the team 92 yards for the winning touchdown on a pass to John Taylor with only 34 seconds left, as they captured their third Super Bowl championship with a score of 20–16 [57] Jerry Rice was named Super Bowl MVP [56]\n\n\nGeorge Seifert years (1989–1996)\nAfter Super Bowl XXIII, Bill Walsh retired as head coach; his defensive coordinator and handpicked successor, George Seifert, took over as head coach [58]\n\n\nSuper Bowl XXIV champions (1989)\nIn the 1989 NFL season, Joe Montana threw for 3,521 yards and 26 touchdowns, with only 8 interceptions, giving him a 112.4 quarterback rating, which was then the highest single-season passer rating in NFL history, and was named NFL Most Valuable Player [59] [60] [61] Jerry Rice, in his fifth year in the league, continued to dominate; he led the league with almost 1,490 receiving yards, and 17 touchdowns [62] The 49ers clinched their fourth straight division title, beating the Los Angeles Rams 30–27 after a dramatic second-half comeback; they finished 14–2, gaining home-field advantage throughout the playoffs Their two losses were by a combined five points [63]\n\n\nSuper Bowl XXIX champions (1994)\nIn 1994, the team spent large amounts of money on the addition of several star free agents from other teams, including Ken Norton Jr., Gary Plummer, Rickey Jackson, Bart Oates, Richard Dent, Charles Mann and Deion Sanders [82] Additionally, several rookie players made key contributions to the team, some becoming season-long starters such as defensive tackle Bryant Young, fullback William Floyd, and linebacker Lee Woodall Due to injuries to the offensive line, the 49ers had some tough times early in the season, including a 40–8 home loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, and a 24–17 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, led by former 49ers quarterback Joe Montana Following the Eagles game, a poll conducted on local sports radio station KNBR showed that an overwhelming majority of 49er fans wanted head coach George Seifert fired The game against the Eagles was a turning point for the 49ers despite the lopsided score Quarterback Steve Young was benched in the 3rd quarter and was later seen on the sidelines, shouting profanities at Seifert The following week in Detroit, the 49ers trailed the Lions 7–0 After throwing a pass, Young was hit, picked up, and driven into the ground by three Lions defenders He crawled most of the way off of the field before refusing help from the trainers as he limped the remaining way off the field He returned to the field two plays later (NFL rules state that after trainers attend to an injured player, that player must leave the field for at least one play) to lead the 49ers to a 27–21 victory The team rallied around Young to win 10 straight games, including a 21–14 victory over the two-time defending Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys During that span the 49ers' average margin of victory was nearly 20 points per game, a sustained dominance not seen since the 1985 Chicago Bears Despite scoring only 8 points in one game and 14 in another, the 49ers set a new record for total regular-season and post-season combined points scored That record was later broken by the New England Patriots in 2007 (the 1998 Minnesota Vikings scored 556 regular-season points, but only 68 postseason points, for a total of 624 points, while the 1994 49ers scored 495 regular-season points and 131 postseason points for a total of 626, the second-highest mark in NFL history) Even after those initial rough spots early in the season, the 49ers finished the season 13–3 and with home-field advantage throughout the playoffs [83] In their first game, they easily defeated the Chicago Bears, 44–15, setting up the third straight 49ers–Cowboys NFC championship game [84] The 49ers took advantage of three early Cowboys turnovers, taking a 21–0 lead in the first quarter Taking a 31–14 lead into halftime after a perfect 29-yard pass from Young to Rice in the closing seconds, the game appeared to be far out of reach for the Cowboys But a 49er fumble on the opening kick of the 3rd quarter led to a Cowboy score, cutting the lead to 31–21 Later, the 49ers responded with a Young touchdown run, making it 38–21, before the Cowboys scored another touchdown in the final minutes for a final score of 38–28 [85] The convincing win qualified the 49ers for their fifth Super Bowl appearance, and the first to be played by two teams from California The 49ers steamrolled the San Diego Chargers 49–26 behind Young's record-setting 6 touchdown passes in Super Bowl XXIX, at the time becoming the first team to win a record five Super Bowls [86] Finally establishing himself as a worthy successor to Joe Montana, Young was named the game's MVP [87] The 49ers' run of five Super Bowl wins in 14 seasons (1981–1994) solidified them alongside the 1960s Vince Lombardi Green Bay Packers and 1970s Chuck Knoll Pittsburgh Steelers as one of the modern NFL's great dynasties [88]\n\n\nYork family era (2000–present)\nDeBartolo returned from his suspension in 1999, but a series of lawsuits over control of the family's vast holdings led him to surrender controlling interest to the Yorks as part of a 2000 settlement Denise York became chair of the board, while John York became CEO On the field, the 1999 49ers got off to a 3–1 start, then in a nationally televised Monday Night Football game against the Arizona Cardinals, Steve Young suffered a blindside hit from cornerback Aeneas Williams that knocked him out of the game and eventually convinced him to retire [105] At the time it was believed the severe hit ended his career but Young later said in interviews he could have come back to play another season or two After meeting with then-general manager Bill Walsh and being told about how the salary cap troubles would make the team non-competitive, Young chose to retire rather than risk his long-term health further for a likely losing club Without their future Hall of Famer, 29-year-old rookie Jeff Garcia took over as starting quarterback, but he would be benched for poor performances in favor of Steve Stenstrom [106] Garcia would be reinstated as the starting quarterback and in the final 5 games of the regular season The 49ers lost 11 of their last 12 games and suffered their first losing season in a non-strike year since 1980, which was also the last time that the 49ers did not win at least ten or more games in a season [107] Bobb McKittrick, 49ers offensive line coach since 1979, also died of cancer following the 1999 season [108]\n\n\nJim Harbaugh years (2011–2014)\nOn January 4, 2011, Jed York promoted interim General Manager Trent Baalke to be the permanent general manager Baalke had taken over the role after former general manager Scot McCloughan was relieved of his duties the year before Two days later, on January 7, 2011, former head coach of Stanford University Jim Harbaugh was named the 49ers new head coach [162] In the 2011 NFL draft, the 49ers selected defensive end/linebacker Aldon Smith from the University of Missouri with the seventh pick of the first round The 49ers also selected quarterback Colin Kaepernick from the University of Nevada, Reno with the 36th overall pick in the second round [163]\n\n\nKyle Shanahan years (2017–present)\nAfter hiring John Lynch as general manager and Kyle Shanahan as head coach, the 49ers started the 2017 season with nine consecutive losses [208] [209] During this time, they traded for New England Patriots backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo [210] After a win over the New York Giants and a loss to the Seattle Seahawks, Garoppolo was named the starter after rookie C J Beathard suffered an injury [211] The 49ers won their last five games with Garoppolo at the helm and finished the season 6–10 After the season, the 49ers signed Garoppolo to a five-year, $137.5 million contract extension This made him the highest-paid player in NFL history on a per-year basis at the time [212] During the third-week matchup between the 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs, Jimmy Garoppolo tore his ACL, and was ruled out for the rest of the 2018 season [213] The 49ers struggled to a 4–12 record in the 2018 season [214]\n\n\nChampionships\nThe 49ers have won five Super Bowls, tied for most of any NFC team, their first three under Bill Walsh Walsh retired after winning his third in 1988, but first-year head coach George Seifert did not miss a beat, winning the Super Bowl in his first year in 1989 He would also win one more in 1994 [245] [246]\n\n\nSuper Bowls\nThe 49ers have won

Rush, dressed in plaid pants and a red shirt, jumping in midair with his hat falling off, and firing pistols in each hand: one nearly shooting his foot, and the other pistol forming the word \"Forty-Niners\" from its smoke [260] An alternate logo with a shield-shaped crest formed from the number \"49\", with a football in the upper right quadrant and \"SF\" in the lower-left quadrant was created in 1965 and used for marketing purposes until 1972 From 1962, the 49ers' logo has been the iconic \"SF\" within the center of a red oval; throughout the years the logo has had minor modifications, such as a black outlining on the intertwined \"SF\" that was added in 1989 and a gold trimming inside the oval that was added in 1996.\n\n\nLogos and uniforms\nThe original 49ers logo

changed uniform designs and color combinations quite often throughout their history From the team's inception in 1946, they wore dark or cardinal red, switching to scarlet red jerseys and gold pants for the 1948 season, with a gold helmet with one red stripe, with solid red socks and pants with no stripes Entering the 1949 season, the first in the NFL, the 49ers adopted three stripes to their red jerseys, wearing gold helmets and pants, with no stripes and red socks with three white stripes In the 1953, '54, and '55 seasons, the 49ers wore red helmets with a gold stripe in the middle, with silver pants with one single stripe of red The socks also added the three stripes similar to the jersey's 1955 was also unique in that the 49ers wore white pants with a black stripe bounded by two red stripes, and shadow drop numbers on their red jerseys, with black shadow drop borders on the white numerals The following season, 1956, the team wore white helmets with no stripes, and white pants with a red stripe In 1957 the 49ers wore red jerseys, a gold helmet with no stripes, and gold pants with no stripes; for the first time the 49ers wore white on the road, as dictated by the NFL for all teams, to have at least one team wearing a light-colored jersey during games The first white jersey had two red stripes with a gold in the middle, as was their road socks: white, with two red stripes and gold in the middle San Francisco wore red and gold in 1958 as well, with their white jersey having a single shoulder loop stripe, as well as adding TV numbers to the sleeves of their home and away jerseys And in contrast to the socks at home, red with three red stripes, the away socks were solid red In 1959 the team switched to red and platinum gold (looking more like silver), and for the next several years afterwards, with their white jerseys having double shoulder loop stripes (mimicking UCLA's), but continuing with the three white stripes on the sleeves above the elbow and below the TV numbers, with the red home jerseys In 1960, the team added \"Northwestern\" red stripes to their helmets (a thicker middle stripe bordered by two thinner stripes), and that changed in 1962, with the addition of the helmet design the team has mostly worn since: white stripe bounded by two red, with the red oval and SF logo on the sides of the helmet In 1964 the team's colors then changed again All silver elements were changed to what was called \"49er Gold;\" helmets were gold New beige-gold pants with a red-white-red tri-stripe in the same style as the helmet were introduced Uniform's basic design would be worn for practically the next 30 seasons with only some minor changes and adjustments, such as a gradual change over from sans-serif to serifed block numerals from 1970 to 1974 and a switch from thin stripes to a very thick pant striping in 1976 (during which white jerseys were also worn at home for most of that season) The uniform ensemble of red and white jerseys, and beige-gold pants with thick striping were worn until 1995 with a few minor changes During the 1994 season, many NFL teams wore \"throwback uniforms\" on occasional games to celebrate the NFL's 75th anniversary (a corresponding diamond-shaped 75th Anniversary patch was also worn by all teams)  The 49ers chose to wear a version of their 1955 uniforms as their throwbacks, with simpler sans-serif block numerals that were outlined and shadowed in black with White pants with thinner red-black-red striping were also worn, along with the old striped red socks The regular 1989–95 design gold helmet was worn with this uniform, as there was no logo on the 1955 helmet.\n\n\nCulture\nThe 49ers official cheerleading squad is called the Gold Rush [269]\nStarted in the early 1980s, the first squad consisted of 14

back into the early 1980s The fanbase has spanned multiple generations since the Walsh-Montana/Seifert-Young era teams had won them five championships Their fans are often referred to as the 49er Faithful, Niner Gang, or utilizing the acronym FTTB an abbreviation of Faithful To The Bay A common chant utilized by the fans in recent years is the chant of \"Bang! Bang! Niner Gang!\" popularized by Bay Area rapper E-40 in 2019 [274] [275]\n\n\nRivalries\nThe rivalry between the Los Angeles Rams and the San Francisco 49ers is considered by many to be one of the greatest NFL rivalries ever, placing No 8 on Sports Illustrated's \"Top 10 NFL Rivalries of All Time\" list, compiled in 2008 [276] After the Rams moved to St Louis, Roger Craig stated in Tales from the San Francisco 49ers Sideline that the Rams would always remain the team's arch-rival, regardless of location [277] The Rams are the only team to have played the 49ers twice every season for the last 58 seasons [278] to combine for more than 100 regular season games; the all-time regular season lead is held by the 49ers 72–67–3 [279] The rivalry regained geographic animosity following their return to Los Angeles in 2016 The rivalry has also regrown a fierce element of animosity between fans, [280] [281] coaches, [282] and players alike [283] [284] [285] [286] The two teams have met twice in the postseason; in the NFC Championship Game The first meeting came on January 14, 1990, when the 49ers crushed the Rams 30–3 at Candlestick Park to advance to the team's historic victory in Super Bowl XXIV [287] Both teams later met again on January 30, 2022, when the Rams rallied from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter to beat the 49ers 20–17 at SoFi Stadium, ending a 6-game loss-streak to the 49ers and ultimately proceeding to win Super Bowl LVI [288]\n\n\nDivisional\nThe rivalry between the Los Angeles Rams and the San Francisco 49ers is considered by many to be one of the greatest

exchange of heated regular season matchups following the NFL's realignment in 2002 that relocated both teams into the same division Prior to 2002, the teams played each other almost every season during the pre-season, but only every three years during the regular season as part of the league scheduling algorithm The rivalry began to intensify after the 49ers hired Jim Harbaugh out of Stanford in 2011, as he and Seahawks and former USC head coach Pete Carroll had been involved in a lengthy feud The matchups regularly grew in intensity through the 2010s, culminating in the two teams meeting in the 2013 NFC Championship which saw Seattle advance and ultimately on to win Super Bowl XLVIII [289] As of the 2023 season, the Seahawks lead the all-time series 30–22 [290]\n\n\nArizona Cardinals\nThough the 49ers and Cardinals initially met in 1951 and would meet occasionally until 2000, this would not develop into a full-fledged rivalry until both teams were placed in the NFC West division in 2002 Longtime-Quarterback Steve Young suffered a career-ending concussion in a game against the Cardinals on September 27, 1999, after taking a brutal hit from Arizona cornerback Aeneas Williams [291] [292] While still a close rivalry in wins; it is often lopsided on both ends After the 49ers won nine of ten meetings between 2009 and 2013, the Cardinals won eight straight meetings between 2014 and 2018 San Francisco currently leads the series 35–29 [293]\n\n\nConference\nThe Green Bay Packers rivalry emerged in the mid-1990s when the Packers upset the 49ers in the 1995 NFC Divisional game at Candlestick Park, ending any chance of a Super Bowl repeat From that point, the Packers beat the 49ers four more times including two post-season games San Francisco was finally able to exact revenge in the 1998 NFC Wild Card round, a game that is remembered for a 25-yard game-winning touchdown reception by Terrell Owens off a Steve Young pass (referred to by some as \"The Catch II\"), lifting the 49ers over the Packers 30–27 Since that game, the Packers had beaten the 49ers eight straight times including once in the 2001 post-season, a streak that came to an end in the 2012 season when the 49ers beat the Packers in Lambeau Field week 1 for the first time since 1990, and again in the NFC Divisional game that same season In the 2019 season the 49ers and Packers met in the 2020 NFC Championship game at Levi's Stadium where the 49ers won 37–20, but went on to lose Super Bowl LIV to the Kansas City Chiefs The Packers also proceeded to lose to the 49ers in the Divisional

1970s The NFL Top 10 ranked this rivalry to be the tenth best in NFL history San Francisco has played Dallas in nine postseason games The Cowboys defeated the 49ers in the 1970 and 1971 NFC championship games, and again in the 1972 Divisional Playoff Game The 1981 NFC championship game in San Francisco, which saw the 49ers' Joe Montana complete a game-winning pass to Dwight Clark in the final minute (now known as The Catch), is one of the most famous games in NFL history The rivalry became even more intense during the 1992–1994 seasons San Francisco and Dallas faced each other in the NFC championship game three separate times Dallas won the first two match-ups, and San Francisco won the third In each of these pivotal match-ups, the game's victor went on to win the Super Bowl Both the Cowboys and the 49ers are third all-time in Super Bowl victories to the Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots with five each The 49ers–Cowboys rivalry is also part of the larger cultural rivalry between California and Texas In recent years, this once-great rivalry has greatly softened, with the struggles of both the Cowboys and 49ers However, in its prime especially in the 1990s, this rivalry was a very bitter one as both teams were the class of the NFL during this time In what was believed to be the greatest upset in the team's rivalry in the modern era, the 49ers upset the Cowboys in the 2021 Wild Card Round.\nThe 2022 49ers would go on to continue their winning streak against the Cowboys winning the divisional round game 19–12 The Cowboys' loss to the 49ers was their seventh straight in the divisional round, which is the longest streak in the second round of the NFL playoffs In Week 5 of 2023–24 season, the 49ers beat the Cowboys 42–10, making it the largest win margin for the 49ers in the history of the rivalry The 49ers lead the all-time series between the two including playoffs 20–19–1 [295]\n\n\nNew York Giants\nThe New York Giants have the most playoff meetings versus the 49ers (eight) The playoff series is currently tied at four wins a piece, and in five of their eight meetings, the winning team has gone on to win the Super Bowl This rivalry is rooted in the 1980s when both teams were on the rise In the first two playoff meetings between these two teams, the Joe Montana-led 49ers won both meetings, 38–24 in 1981 and 21–10 in 1984 both in the divisional round at Candlestick Park; the 49ers went on to win their first two Super Bowl championships both seasons The Giants won the next three playoff meetings, which included a 49–3 rout at Giants Stadium in 1986, and the 1990 NFC championship, where they upset the 49ers 15–13, ruining the 49ers hopes of a Super Bowl three-peat after Roger Craig lost a fumble late in the fourth quarter and let the Giants score on a last-second field goal Giants also went on to win their first two Super Bowl championships both seasons The 49ers defeated the Giants 44–3 in 1993 in the divisional round [296]  In the 2002 NFC wildcard game, the Giants were ahead 38–14 late in the third quarter; however, the 49ers came back from the 24-point deficit to beat the Giants with a 39–38 victory The teams met again in the 2011 NFC championship at Candlestick Park, and just like the 1990 NFC championship, it was a low-scoring game; the Giants won the game on a Lawrence Tynes 31-yard field goal in overtime, 20–17 In an eerie similarity to Roger Craig's fumble 21 years earlier, Kyle Williams fumbled a punt in the crucial minutes of the game, and just like the last two times, the Giants beat the 49ers in the playoffs, they went on to win the Super Bowl  San Francisco leads the all-time series 22–21 [297]\n\n\nHistoric\nThe Atlanta Falcons were also division rivals with the 49ers until the Falcons moved to the NFC South in 2002 after the realignment [120]Just like the Saints, the 49ers had dominated the Falcons when they played in the NFC West, but the Falcons won their first four games (spanning nine seasons) against the 49ers since moving to the NFC South Both teams met in the divisional round of the 1998 playoffs Garrison Hearst suffered an ankle break after his foot was caught in the Georgia Dome turf and twisted severely as he tried to spin away from Falcons' defensive end Chuck Smith on the first play from scrimmage; the 49ers lost that game 20–18 They met in the 2012 NFC championship, in which the 49ers, led by quarterback Colin Kaepernick, defeated the top-seeded Falcons in Atlanta by a score of 28–24 The next year, the Falcons played against the 49ers in the final home game at Candlestick Park ever The game ended in a dramatic interception return for a touchdown by 49ers linebacker NaVorro Bowman, known as \"The Pick at the 'Stick\" [298] [299] The 49ers maintain an overall 47–32–1 against the Falcons, but are tied 1–1 in the postseason [300]\n\n\nAtlanta Falcons\nThe Atlanta Falcons were also division rivals with the 49ers until the Falcons moved to

games between the two were referred to as the \"Battle of the Bay\" [301] The first exhibition game played in 1967, ended with the NFL 49ers defeating the AFL Raiders 13–10 After the 1970 merger, the 49ers won in Oakland 38–7 The rivalry still remained heated when the Raiders moved to Los Angeles, leaving many Raider fans in Northern California bitter over the move, and some of them becoming 49er fans, added with the antagonism between Northern and Southern California The Raiders notably upset the defending Super Bowl champion 49ers in San Francisco in 1982, winning 23–17  In addition, both teams have shared a number of players, most notably Jim Plunkett, Jerry Rice, Ronnie Lott, Michael Crabtree, Tom Rathman, and Charlie Garner [302]\n\n\nCleveland Browns\nIn the AAFC, the only other competitive team other than the 49ers was the Cleveland Browns, who they played twice each of the four years the league was in service; Cleveland lost four games in the AAFC, and San Francisco was responsible for two of them, including the one that broke a 29-game streak where Cleveland did not lose a game The final game in AAFC history matched the two for the AAFC Championship, which Cleveland won 21–7 The rivalry did not last into the NFL years, particularly after the teams were placed in opposite conferences in 1970  The rivalry has turned into a friendly relationship as many 49ers personnel helped the Browns relaunch in 1999, specifically former 49ers president and CEO Carmen Policy and vice president/director of football operations Dwight Clark, who were hired by the expansion Browns in the same roles  In addition, 49ers owners John York and Denise DeBartolo York reside in Youngstown, 60 miles (97 km) southeast of Cleveland Long-time Browns placekicker and fan favorite Phil Dawson and backup quarterback Colt McCoy signed with the 49ers in 2014 As of the 2023 season, the Browns lead the all-time series 20–10 [304]\n\n\nSeason-by-season records\nThis is a partial list of

{"title": "Peter_Wright_(darts_player)", "content": "\nEarly life, BDO, and beginnings of PDC career\nBorn in Livingston, Scotland, to a 16-year-old single mother, Wright moved to London with his mother when he was three years old because she feared that her sisters would take her child away from her [2] Although he has lived in England ever since, he chooses to represent Scotland in sports He stated that he first became interested in darts through watching players such as Cliff Lazerenko, Jocky Wilson, and Eric Bristow on TV in the early 1980s [3] He received a set of darts for his 13th birthday, but since his mother could not afford a dartboard, he initially threw them at trees After some practice, he was able to beat his stepfather and his stepfather's friends [3] Within a few years, he was regarded as one of the most promising young players in London [4]\n\n\nPDC\nBDO\n\n\n2009–2010\n2009 proved to be a much better year for Wright as he made his PDC televised debut at the 2009 Las Vegas Desert Classic where he was defeated 6–3 by Colin Lloyd in the first round [10] His good form on the PDC Pro Tour, helped by a semi-final showing in the Las Vegas Players Championship, earned him qualification for the 2009 World Matchplay [11] [12] Wright played Terry Jenkins in the first round and lost 10–4 [13] Further quarter-final and semi-final runs followed in Players Championship events to qualify for his first PDC World Championship, where he lost 3–1 in sets to Michael van Gerwen in the opening round [14]\n\n\n2011 season\nWright won a match at the World Championship for the first time in 2011 by beating Co Stompé 3–1 and then saw off Paul Nicholson to face defending champion Phil Taylor in the third round Wright lost 4–1 and averaged a very respectable 96.56 [18] He enjoyed a good run at the UK Open which was ended in the last 16 by Mark Hylton and played in his second World Matchplay where Simon Whitlock beat him 10–7 in the first round [19] [20] Wright's first quarter-final appearance in a major event came at the European Championship with victories over John Part and Gary Anderson, before losing again to Whitlock this time 10–6 [21] His form continued by reaching the final of the 18th Players Championship of the year and a 6–2 loss to Anderson [22] Wright defeated Denis Ovens 6–4 in the opening round of the Players Championship Finals but lost 8–6 to Wes Newton in the subsequent round [23]\n\n\n2012 season\nWright was unable to repeat his 2011 run in the 2012 edition of the World Championship, as he lost 3–1 to Jelle Klaasen in the first round Wright missed 11 consecutive darts at doubles in the first two sets of the match [24] Wright represented Scotland with Gary Anderson in the 2012 PDC World Cup of Darts and together they were beaten by South Africa in the second round, losing in a sudden-death leg [25] Wright defeated Andy Brown and former world champions John Part and Richie Burnett to reach the last 16 of the UK Open where he played Raymond van Barneveld [26] Wright led 8–6 and was on a 138 finish on his throw to advance to the quarter-finals and beat the Dutchman for the first time He hit treble 20 with his first dart and then single 18 to leave 60, meaning single 20 with his last dart would have left double top for the win when he returned to the board However, Wright hit another treble 20 to bust his score and went on to lose the match 9–8 [27]\n\n\n2013 season\nAt the 2013 World Championship Wright saw off Arron Monk 3–0 in the first round to set up a meeting with the second favourite for the tournament, Michael van Gerwen, who Wright described as \"not good enough\" before the match [31] [32] Wright won the first two sets, but van Gerwen won 12 of the next 14 legs to

After graduating from Brooks School and Princeton University, where he studied architecture, Stevenson moved to Hollywood and landed a role opposite Sam Elliott in the 1976 film Lifeguard.\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, Stevenson appeared in a wide range of films and television shows, including the popular television series Baywatch, where he played the role of Craig Patrick Morris. He also appeared in a number of made-for-television movies and guest-starred on various television shows.\n\nStevenson's career has spanned over four decades, and he has established himself as a versatile and talented actor. His ability to take on a wide range of roles has earned him a loyal following, and he continues to be a popular figure in the entertainment industry.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nStevenson was married to his first wife, actress Kirstie Alley, on December 22, 1983, and they divorced in 1997. During their marriage, they adopted two children: a son in 1992 and a daughter in 1995. Stevenson's family life has been marked by his commitment to his children and his ex-wife, and he has spoken publicly about the importance of family in his life.\n\nIn addition to his work in the entertainment industry, Stevenson has been involved in various philanthropic efforts over the years.

{"title": "Aphasia", "content": "\nSigns and symptoms\nPeople with aphasia may experience any of the following behaviors due to an acquired brain injury, although some of these symptoms may be due to related or concomitant problems, such as dysarthria or apraxia, and not primarily due to aphasia Aphasia symptoms can vary based on the location of damage in the brain Signs and symptoms may or may not be present in individuals with aphasia and may vary in severity and level of disruption to communication [10] Often those with aphasia may have a difficulty with naming objects, so they might use words such as thing or point at the objects When asked to name a pencil they may say it is a \"thing used to write\" [11]\n\n\nRelated behaviors\nGiven the previously stated signs and symptoms, the following behaviors are often seen in people with aphasia as a result of attempted compensation for incurred speech and language deficits:\n\n\nSubcortical\nWhile aphasia has traditionally been described in terms of language deficits, there is increasing evidence that many people with aphasia commonly experience co-occurring non-linguistic cognitive deficits in areas such as attention, memory, executive functions and learning [13] [14] [15] By some accounts, cognitive deficits, such as attention and working memory constitute the underlying cause of language impairment in people with aphasia [16] Others suggest that cognitive deficits often co-occur, but are comparable to cognitive deficits in stroke patients without aphasia and reflect general brain dysfunction following injury [17] Whilst it has been shown that cognitive neural networks support language reorganisation after stroke, [18]\nThe degree to which deficits in attention and other cognitive domains underlie language deficits in aphasia is still unclear [19]\n\n\nCognitive deficits\nWhile aphasia has traditionally been described in terms of language deficits, there is increasing evidence that many people with

reorganisation after stroke, [18]\nThe degree to which deficits in attention and other cognitive domains underlie language deficits in aphasia is still unclear [19]\n\n\nCauses\nAphasia is most often caused by stroke, where about a quarter of patients who experience an acute stroke develop aphasia [39] However, any disease or damage to the parts of the brain that control language can cause aphasia Some of these can include brain tumors, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy and progressive neurological disorders [40] In rare cases, aphasia may also result from herpesviral encephalitis [41] The herpes simplex virus affects the frontal and temporal lobes, subcortical structures, and the hippocampal tissue, which can trigger aphasia [42] In acute disorders, such as head injury or stroke, aphasia usually develops quickly When caused by brain tumor, infection, or dementia, it develops more slowly [7] [43]\n\n\nDiagnosis\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are the most common neuroimaging tools used in identifying aphasia and studying the extent of damage in the loss of language abilities This is done by doing MRI scans and locating the extent of lesions or damage within brain tissue, particularly within areas of the left frontal and temporal regions- where a lot of language related areas lie In fMRI studies a language related task is often completed and then the BOLD image is analyzed If there are lower than normal BOLD responses that indicate a lessening of blood flow to the affected area and can show quantitatively that the cognitive task is not being completed.\n\n\nNeuroimaging methods\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are the most common neuroimaging tools used in identifying aphasia and studying the extent of damage in the loss of language abilities This is done by doing MRI scans and locating the extent of lesions or damage within brain tissue, particularly within areas of the left frontal and temporal regions- where a lot of language related areas lie In fMRI studies a language related task is often completed and then the BOLD image is analyzed If there are lower than normal BOLD responses that indicate a lessening of blood flow to the affected area and can show quantitatively that the cognitive task is not being completed.\n\n\nClassification\nAphasia is best thought of as a collection of different disorders, rather than a single problem Each individual with aphasia will present with their own particular combination of language strengths and weaknesses Consequently, it is a major challenge just to document the various difficulties that can occur in different people, let alone decide how they might best be treated Most classifications of the aphasias tend to divide the various symptoms into broad classes A common approach is to distinguish between the fluent aphasias (where speech remains fluent, but content may be lacking, and the person may have difficulties understanding others), and the nonfluent aphasias (where speech is very halting and effortful, and may consist of just one or two words at a time) [59]\n\n\nBoston classification\nLocalizationist approaches aim to classify the aphasias according to their major presenting characteristics and the regions of the brain that most probably gave rise to them [75] [76] Inspired by the early work of nineteenth-century neurologists Paul Broca and Carl Wernicke, these approaches identify two major subtypes of aphasia and several more minor subtypes:\n\n\nClassical-localizationist approaches\nLocalizationist approaches aim to classify the aphasias according to their major presenting characteristics and the regions of the brain that most probably gave rise to them [75] [76] Inspired by the early work of nineteenth-century neurologists Paul Broca and Carl Wernicke, these approaches identify two major subtypes of aphasia and several more minor subtypes:\n\n\nCognitive neuropsychological approaches\nAlthough localizationist approaches provide a useful way of classifying the different patterns of language difficulty into broad groups, one problem is that most individuals do not fit neatly into one category or another [79] [80] Another problem is that the categories, particularly the major ones such as Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, still remain quite broad and do not meaningfully reflect a person's difficulties Consequently, even amongst those who meet the criteria for classification into a subtype, there can be enormous variability in the types of difficulties they experience [81]\n\n\nProgressive aphasias\nPrimary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative focal dementia that can be associated with progressive illnesses or dementia, such as frontotemporal dementia / Pick Complex Motor neuron disease, Progressive supranuclear palsy, and Alzheimer's disease, which is the gradual process of progressively losing the ability to think Gradual loss of language function occurs in the context of relatively well-preserved memory, visual processing, and personality until the advanced stages Symptoms usually begin with word-finding problems (naming) and progress to impaired grammar (syntax) and comprehension (sentence processing and semantics) The loss of language before the loss of memory differentiates PPA from typical dementias People with PPA may have difficulties comprehending what others are saying They can also have difficulty trying to find the right words to make a sentence [84] [85] [86] There are three classifications of Primary Progressive Aphasia : Progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), Semantic Dementia (SD), and Logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA) [86] [87]\n\n\nDeaf aphasia\nThere have been many instances showing that there is a form of aphasia among deaf individuals Sign languages are, after all, forms of language that have been shown to use the same areas of the brain as verbal forms of language Mirror neurons become activated when an animal is acting in a particular way or watching another individual act in the same manner These mirror neurons are important in giving an individual the ability to mimic movements of hands Broca's area of speech production has been shown to contain several of these mirror neurons resulting in significant similarities of brain activity between sign language and vocal speech communication People use facial movements to create, what other people perceive, to be faces of emotions While combining these facial movements with speech, a more full form of language is created which enables the species to interact with a much more complex and detailed form of communication Sign language also uses these facial movements and emotions along with the primary hand movement way of communicating These facial movement forms of communication come from the same areas of the brain When dealing with damages to certain areas of the brain, vocal forms of communication are in jeopardy of severe forms of aphasia Since these same areas of the brain are being used for sign language, these same, at least very similar, forms of aphasia can show in the Deaf community Individuals can show a form of Wernicke's aphasia with sign language and they show deficits in their abilities in being able to produce any form of expressions Broca's aphasia shows up in some people, as well These individuals find tremendous difficulty in being able to actually sign the linguistic concepts they are trying to express [88]\n\n\nSeverity\nThe severity of the type of aphasia varies depending on the size of the stroke However, there is much variance between how often one type of severity occurs in certain types of aphasia For instance, any type of aphasia can range from mild to profound Regardless of the severity of aphasia, people can make improvements due to spontaneous recovery and treatment in the acute stages of recovery [89] Additionally, while most studies propose that the greatest outcomes occur in people with severe aphasia when treatment is provided in the acute stages of recovery, Robey (1998) also found that those with severe aphasia are capable of making strong language gains in the chronic stage of recovery as well [89] This finding implies that persons with aphasia have the potential to have functional outcomes regardless of how severe their aphasia may be [89] While there is no distinct pattern of the outcomes of aphasia based on severity alone, global aphasia typically makes functional language gains, but may be gradual since global aphasia affects many language areas [citation needed]\n\n\nPrevention\nAphasia is largely caused by unavoidable instances However, some precautions can be taken to decrease risk for experiencing one of the two major causes of aphasia: stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) To decrease the probability of having an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, one should take the following precautions:\n\n\nManagement\nMost acute cases of aphasia recover some or most skills by participating in speech and language therapy Recovery and improvement can continue for years after the stroke After the onset of aphasia, there is approximately a six-month period of spontaneous recovery; during this time, the brain is attempting to recover and repair the damaged neurons Improvement varies widely, depending on the aphasia's cause, type, and severity Recovery also depends on the person's age, health, motivation, handedness, and educational level [43]\n\n\nIndividualized service delivery\nIntensity of treatment should be individualized based on the recency of stroke, therapy goals, and other specific characteristics such as age, size of lesion, overall health status, and motivation [116] [117] Each individual reacts differently to treatment intensity and is able to tolerate treatment at different times post-stroke [117] Intensity of treatment after a stroke should be dependent on the person's motivation, stamina, and tolerance for therapy [118]\n\n\nOutcomes\nIf the symptoms of aphasia last longer than two or three months after a stroke, a complete recovery is unlikely However, it is important to note that some people continue to improve over a period of years and even decades Improvement is a slow process that usually involves both helping the individual and family understand the nature of aphasia and learning compensatory strategies for communicating [119]\n\n\nPrevalence\nAphasia affects about two million people in the U.S and 250,000 people in Great Britain [122] Nearly 180,000 people acquire the disorder every year in the U.S., [123] 170,000 due to stroke [124] Any person of any age can develop aphasia, given that it is often caused by a traumatic injury However, people who are middle aged and older are the most likely to acquire aphasia, as the other etiologies are more likely at older ages [125] For example, approximately 75% of all strokes occur in individuals over the age of 65 [126] Strokes account for most documented cases of aphasia: [127] 25% to 40% of people who survive a stroke develop aphasia as a result of damage to the language-processing regions of the brain [6]\n\n\nHistory\nThe first recorded case of aphasia is from an Egyptian papyrus, the Edwin Smith Papyrus, which details speech problems in a person with a traumatic brain injury to the temporal lobe [128]\n\n\nEtymology\nAphasia is from Greek a- (\"without\", negative prefix) + phásis (φάσις, \"speech\").\n\n\nFurther research\nResearch is currently being done using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to witness the difference in how language is processed in normal brains vs aphasic brains This will help researchers to understand exactly what the brain must go through in order to recover from Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and how different areas of the brain respond after such an injury [134]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Aphasia is a complex and multifaceted disorder that affects an individual's ability to

motivation, handedness, and educational level [43]\n\n\nIndividualized service delivery\nIntensity of treatment should be individualized based on the recency of stroke, therapy goals, and other specific characteristics such as age, size of lesion, overall health status, and motivation [116] [117] Each individual reacts differently to treatment intensity and is able to tolerate treatment at different times post-stroke [117] Intensity of treatment after a stroke should be dependent on the person's motivation, stamina, and tolerance for therapy [118]\n\n\nOutcomes\nIf the symptoms of aphasia last longer than two or three months after a stroke, a complete recovery is unlikely However, it is important to note that some people continue to improve over a period of years and even decades Improvement is a slow process that usually involves both helping the individual and family understand the nature of aphasia and learning compensatory strategies for communicating [119]\n\n\nPrevalence\nAphasia affects about two million people in the U.S and 250,000 people in Great Britain [122] Nearly 180,000 people acquire the disorder every year in the U.S., [123] 170,000 due to stroke [124] Any person of any age can develop aphasia, given that it is often caused by a traumatic injury However, people who are middle aged and older are the most likely to acquire aphasia, as the other etiologies are more likely at older ages [125] For example, approximately 75% of all strokes occur in individuals over the age of 65 [126] Strokes account for most documented cases of aphasia: [127] 25% to 40% of people who survive a stroke develop aphasia as a result of damage to the language-processing regions of the brain [6]\n\n\nHistory\nThe first recorded case of aphasia is from an Egyptian papyrus, the Edwin Smith Papyrus, which details speech problems in a person with a traumatic brain injury to the temporal lobe [128]\n\n\nEtymology\nAphasia is from Greek a- (\"without\", negative prefix) + phásis (φάσις, \"speech\").\n\n\nFurther research\nResearch is currently being done using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to witness the difference in how language is processed in normal brains vs aphasic brains This will help researchers to understand exactly what the brain must go through in order to recover from Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and how different areas of the brain respond after such an injury [134]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

department [33]\n\n\nProtest \"interveners\"\nDuring several of the demonstrations, a group of volunteers with the local organization Minnesota Freedom Fighters patrolled the crowd and attempted to deescalate conflict The group formed in 2020 during the unrest in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder when outside agitators harassed residents in late May and early June of that year Some volunteers wore yellow vests to distinguish themselves at Daunte Wright protest events, while others wore body armor and dark clothing to move undetected in the crowd The volunteers used passive tactics, such as standing between lines of demonstrator who wielded umbrellas and formed an addition perimeter to the security fencing outside the Brooklyn Center police station Their stated goal was to keep events peaceful and prevent law enforcement form using aggressive crowd control tactics, such as firing munitions on demonstrators [32] The group was one of several organizations that Brooklyn Center officials contracted with to act as \"interveners\" and to create open lines of communication with law enforcement The groups were not authorized to make arrests, but were allowed to \"use some

unable to move [150]\n\n\nShort-term impact\nRepresentative Maxine Waters' comments at a protest rally in Brooklyn Center on April 17, 2021, drew criticism for heightening tension [171] and were denounced by conservative media and Republican politicians [172] On April 19, 2021, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin's attorney unsuccessfully argued in court that comments made by Representative Waters during a Brooklyn Center protest should result in a mistrial Judge Peter Cahill denied the motion by Chauvin's defense, but said it might be potential grounds for appeal of the

Cahill denied the motion by Chauvin's defense, but said it might be potential grounds for appeal of the case later if Chauvin was to be convicted [60] Chauvin was found guilty of murdering Floyd on April 20, 2021 [134]\n\n\nProperty damage\nThirty-five businesses in Brooklyn Center were damaged from April 11–12, 2021, including a Dollar Tree store that was set on fire during the chaotic course of events [15] [173] [150] Five business at a strip mall in Brooklyn Park were broken into and three were set on fire during the overnight hours of April 18–19, 2021 [16] [27] Several of the businesses damaged by fires and looting during the April 2021 unrest were Black-owned establishments [27]\n\n\nPublic health\nProtests over Wright's death came during the COVID-19 pandemic in Minnesota Many protesters wore protective face masks State health officials reported that by April 30, 2021, there had 22 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among protesters and police who were at demonstrations [174]\n\n\nPotter criminal case\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison took over the prosecution case against Potter on May 21, 2021, upon the request of Washington County Attorney Pete Orput Protesters, who held several demonstrations outside Orput's home to press him to file more serious murder charges, took credit for the development [176] On May 24, 2021, Washington County prosecutor Imran Ali, the attorney who would have led the prosecution of Potter, resigned from his job citing “vitriol\" and \"partisan politics” over the case [177] Ellison's office on September 2, 2021, added the charge of first-degree manslaughter, a more serious charge than the second-degree manslaughter initially filed, that Potter would face at a November 2021 trial [178]\n\n\nDemonstrator

Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliot called for law enforcement to use more restraint by not firing munitions or tear gas into the crowd and by not kettling those who protest peacefully.\n\n**Day 8: Sunday, April 18, 2021**\n\nAt approximately 4:20 a.m. on Sunday, April 18, 2021, in the Jordan neighborhood of Minneapolis, several gunshots were fired from a passing SUV at National Guard troops stationed near Penn and Broadway. The troops were there to provide neighborhood security following the killing of Daunte Wright.\n\n**Day 9: Monday, April 19, 2021**\n\nOn Monday, April 19, 2021, at 1:10 a.m., fire department crews in Brooklyn Park responded to a fire at a strip mall. Authorities investigated it as a suspected arson. Five businesses had their storefront doors smashed in, three of which suffered fire damage.\n\n**Subsequent Protests and Civil Disorder**\n\nWright's family held a public viewing and memorial service in Minneapolis on April 21, 2021. Daunte Wright's funeral was held in Minneapolis at the Shiloh Temple International Ministries on April 22, 2021. Although the past several nights had been peaceful, Brooklyn Center officials declared an overnight curfew.\n\n**Memorials and Reaction to Potter's Criminal Proceedings**\n\nWright's family held a public viewing and memorial service in Minneapolis on April 21, 2021. Daunte Wright's funeral was held in Minneapolis at the Shiloh Temple International Ministries on April 22, 2021. Although the past several nights had been peaceful, Brooklyn Center officials declared an overnight curfew.\n\n**Government Mobilization**\n\nThe protests and unrest over Wright's death came during the trial of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who had been charged with several murder counts related to George Floyd's murder the previous May. Local officials had proactively mobilized several law enforcement agencies and the Minnesota National Guard in an effort referred to as Operation Safety Net, to prepare for potential unrest during Chauvin's trial or as a result of it.\n\n**Attacks on Law Enforcement and Troops**\n\nSome demonstrators threw bricks, glass bottles, and other objects and discharged fireworks at law enforcement authorities. The glass-door entrance to the Brooklyn Park police station was hit by a gunshot on April 11, 2021. A Saint Paul officer was fired upon while patrolling for potential looting or burglaries on April 13, 2021. A National Guard vehicle in Minneapolis was hit by gunshots fired from a passing vehicle on April 18, 2021.\n\n**Attacks on Protesters and the Press**\n\nLaw enforcement fired tear gas and non-lethal munitions as some demonstrators attempted to overrun the Brooklyn Center police station. Local agencies and officials disagreed over tactics to manage unruly crowds. The Hennepin County Sherriff's Office led the defense operation around the Brooklyn Center police building, while Brooklyn Center elected officials objected to the use of tear gas and aggressive crowd control tactics.\n\n**Protest \"Interveners\"**\n\nDuring several of the demonstrations, a group of volunteers with the local organization Minnesota Freedom Fighters patrolled the crowd and attempted to deescalate conflict. The group formed in 2020 during the unrest in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder when outside agitators harassed residents in late May and early June of that year.\n\n**Residents and Businesses**\n\nSeveral families that lived in apartments near the Brooklyn Center police station left their residences to avoid the nightly protests. Some residents stayed behind to guard apartment buildings. After the April 2021 unrest and prior to Potter's trial in December, many residents moved out of apartment buildings near the police station out of worries of future unrest, but some on Section 8 housing assistance were unable to move.\n\n**Short-term Impact**\n\nRepresentative Maxine Waters' comments at a protest rally in Brooklyn Center on April 17, 2021, drew criticism for heightening tension and were denounced by conservative media and Republican politicians. On April 19, 2021, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin's attorney unsuccessfully argued in court that comments made by Representative Waters during a Brooklyn Center protest should result in a mistrial. Judge Peter Cahill denied the motion by Chauvin's defense, but said it might be potential grounds for appeal of the case later if Chauvin was to be convicted.\n\n**Property Damage**\n\nThirty-five businesses in Brooklyn Center were damaged from April 11-12, 2021, including a Dollar Tree store that was set on fire during the chaotic course of events. Five businesses at a strip mall in Brooklyn Park were broken into and three were set on fire during the overnight hours of April 18-19, 2021. Several of the businesses damaged by fires and looting during the April 2021 unrest were Black-owned establishments.\n\n**Public Health**\n\nProtests over Wright's death came during the COVID-19 pandemic in Minnesota. Many protesters wore protective face masks. State health officials reported that by April 30, 2021, there had been 22 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among protesters and police who were at demonstrations.\n\n**Potter Criminal Case**\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison took over the prosecution case against Potter on May 21, 2021, upon the request of Washington County Attorney Pete Orput. Protesters, who held several demonstrations outside Orput's home to press him to file more serious murder charges, took credit for the development.\n\n**Demonstrator Charges**\n\nJamoni Raekwon Blackstone, a 24-year-old man from North Saint Paul, was charged with attempted murder for firing gunshots at an occupied Saint Paul police vehicle at 10:30 p.m. CDT on April 13, 2021. Blackstone had posted to the Facebook website that after seeing the video of Wright's death he was going to \"start shooting.\" The night of April 13, he fired six shots at the police vehicle with several bullets striking the driver's area of the police vehicle.\n\n**Shooting at Saint Paul Police**\n\nJamoni Raekwon Blackstone, a 24-year-old man from North Saint Paul, was charged with attempted murder for firing gunshots at an occupied Saint Paul police vehicle at 10:30 p.m. CDT on April 13, 2021. Blackstone had posted to the Facebook website that after seeing the video of Wright's death he was going to \"start shooting.\" The night of April 13, he fired six shots at the police vehicle with several bullets striking the driver's area of the police vehicle.\n\n**Shooting at Minnesota National Guard**\n\nThe United States District Attorney's Office for Minnesota announced charges in connection to the drive-by shooting of Minnesota National Guard troops who were mobilized as a result of demonstrations over Wright's death and stationed in Minneapolis on April 18, 2021, to provide neighborhood security.\n\n**Judicial Tampering**\n\nCortez Rice, a resident of Minneapolis and local activist, was charged in Hennepin County for harassment involving retaliation against a judicial officer for the November 6, 2021, protest outside a condominium believed to belong to Regina Chu, the judge presiding over the Potter trial.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Daunte Wright\n* Kimberly Potter\n*

protesters and the press\nLaw enforcement fired tear gas and non-lethal munitions as some demonstrators attempted to overrun the Brooklyn Center police station [33] Local agencies and officials, however, disagreed over tactics to manage unruly crowds The Hennepin County Sherriff's Office led the defense operation around the Brooklyn Center police building Brooklyn Center elected officials objected to the use of tear gas and aggressive crowd control tactics [104] [31] In neighboring Minneapolis, the city council voted 11-1 on April 16, 2021, to oppose the use of non-lethal munitions and tear gas as a response to civil disorder, but the resolution had no effect as the city's mayor had operational control of the city's police department [33]\n\n\nProtest \"interveners\"\nDuring several of the demonstrations, a group of volunteers with the local organization Minnesota Freedom Fighters patrolled the crowd and attempted to deescalate conflict The group formed in 2020 during the unrest in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder when outside agitators harassed residents in late May and early June of that year Some volunteers wore yellow vests to distinguish themselves at Daunte Wright protest events, while others wore body armor and dark clothing to move undetected in the crowd The volunteers used passive tactics, such as standing between lines of demonstrator who wielded umbrellas and formed an addition perimeter to the security fencing outside the Brooklyn Center police station Their stated goal was to keep events peaceful and prevent law enforcement form using aggressive crowd control tactics, such as firing munitions on demonstrators [32] The group was one of several organizations that Brooklyn Center officials contracted with to act as \"interveners\" and to create open lines of communication with law enforcement The groups were not authorized to make arrests, but were allowed to \"use some type of force\" to remove agitators from the crowd Brooklyn Center spent $140,000 for contracts with six different community organizations [166]\n\n\nResidents and businesses\nSeveral families that lived in apartments near the Brooklyn Center police station left their residences to avoid the nightly protests Some residents stayed behind to guard apartment buildings [30] After the April 2021 unrest and prior to Potter's trial in December, many residents moved out of apartment buildings near the police station out of worries of future unrest, but some on Section 8 housing assistance were unable to move [150]\n\n\nShort-term impact\nRepresentative Maxine Waters' comments at a protest rally in Brooklyn Center on April 17, 2021, drew criticism for heightening tension [171] and were denounced by conservative media and Republican politicians [172] On April 19, 2021, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin's attorney unsuccessfully argued in court that comments made by Representative Waters during a Brooklyn Center protest should result in a mistrial Judge Peter Cahill denied the motion by Chauvin's defense, but said it might be potential grounds for appeal of the case later if Chauvin was to be convicted [60] Chauvin was found guilty of murdering Floyd on April 20, 2021 [134]\n\n\nMaxine Waters and the Chauvin trial\nRepresentative Maxine Waters' comments at a protest rally in Brooklyn Center on April 17, 2021, drew criticism for heightening tension [171] and were denounced by conservative media and Republican politicians [172] On April 19, 2021, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin's attorney unsuccessfully argued in court that comments made by Representative Waters during a Brooklyn Center protest should result in a mistrial Judge Peter Cahill denied the motion by Chauvin's defense, but said it might be potential grounds for appeal of the case later if Chauvin was to be convicted [60] Chauvin was found guilty of murdering Floyd on April 20, 2021 [134]\n\n\nProperty damage\nThirty-five businesses in Brooklyn Center were damaged from April 11–12, 2021, including a Dollar Tree store that was set on fire during the chaotic course of events [15] [173] [150] Five business at a strip mall in Brooklyn Park were broken into and three were set on fire during the overnight hours of April 18–19, 2021 [16] [27] Several of the businesses damaged by fires and looting during the April 2021 unrest were Black-owned establishments [27]\n\n\nPublic health\nProtests over Wright's death came during the COVID-19 pandemic in Minnesota Many protesters wore protective face masks State health officials reported that by April 30, 2021, there had 22 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among protesters and police who were at demonstrations [174]\n\n\nPotter criminal case\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison took over the prosecution case against Potter on May 21, 2021, upon the request of Washington County Attorney Pete Orput Protesters, who held several demonstrations outside Orput's home to press him to file more serious murder charges, took credit for the development [176] On May 24, 2021, Washington County prosecutor Imran Ali, the attorney who would have led the prosecution of Potter, resigned from his job citing “vitriol\" and \"partisan politics” over the case [177] Ellison's office on September 2, 2021, added the charge of first-degree manslaughter, a more serious charge than the second-degree manslaughter initially filed, that Potter would face at a November 2021 trial [178]\n\n\nDemonstrator charges\nJamoni Raekwon Blackstone, a 24-year-old man from North Saint Paul was charged with attempted murder for firing gunshots at an occupied Saint Paul police vehicle at 10:30 p.m CDT on April 13, 2021 Prior to the incident, Blackstone had posted to the Facebook website that after seeing the video of Wright's death he was going to \"start shooting\" The night of April 13 he fired six shots at the police vehicle with several bullets striking the driver's area of the police vehicle [99] The officer inside was not injured [21] Blackstone had claimed after being arrested that he fired at the officer's vehicle in an act of self-defense [179] He pleaded guilty on November 19, 2021, to one count of attempted intentional murder in the second-degree He was sentenced to 10 years in prison and five years of supervised release [99]\n\n\nShooting at Saint Paul police\nJamoni Raekwon Blackstone, a 24-year-old man from North Saint Paul was charged with attempted murder for firing gunshots at an occupied Saint Paul police vehicle at 10:30 p.m CDT on April 13, 2021 Prior to the incident, Blackstone had posted to the Facebook website that after seeing the video of Wright's death he was going to \"start shooting\" The night of April 13 he fired six shots at the police vehicle

an act of self-defense [179] He pleaded guilty on November 19, 2021, to one count of attempted intentional murder in the second-degree He was sentenced to 10 years in prison and five years of supervised release [99]\n\n\nShooting at Minnesota National Guard\nThe United States District Attorney's Office for Minnesota announced charges in connection to the drive-by shooting of Minnesota National Guard troops who were mobilized as a result of demonstrations over Wright's death and stationed in Minneapolis on April 18, 2021, to provide neighborhood security [125] [38] [123] Two soldiers had non-life-threatening injuries from glass that shattered when a bullet went through their vehicle's window Andrew Thomas, a 28-year-old man with home addresses in Minneapolis and Chicago, [20] [37] and a juvenile passenger were stopped by Minneapolis police while driving a vehicle that matched a description from the April 18 shooting Thomas was charged by federal authorities with felony possession of a firearm [125] [38] [163] Hennepin County officials charged Thomas with first-degree and second-degree assault with a dangerous weapon and illegal weapons possession [20] In July 2021, Thomas pleaded guilty in Hennepin County court to charges related to the drive-by shooting and illegal possession of a firearm He received an eight-year sentence that included five years in jail and three years under supervised release [37]\n\n\nJudicial tampering\nCortez Rice, a resident of Minneapolis and local activist, was charged in Hennepin County for harassment involving retaliation against a judicial officer for the November 6, 2021, protest outside a condominium believed to belong to Regina Chu, the judge presiding over the Potter trial Chu did not reside at the residence at the time of the protest The criminal complaint alleged that Rice was attempting to intimidate Chu Protesters on November 6 demanded that Chu allow cameras in the courtroom during the trial Chu had also overseen a hearing for Rice related to probation violation on weapons charges Rice was arrested on November 29, 2021, in Waukesha, Wisconsin, and extradited to Minnesota [14] [146] The tampering charge against Rice was dismissed by a Hennepin County District Judge William H Leary III on February 4, 2022 The Judge Leary said the prosecution was not able to prove that Chu was \"in fear of substantial bodily harm to her or her family\" [180] Rice, however, remained jailed for violating probation for prior illegal weapons conviction [181]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther

Her father, Johnny Depp, is a renowned actor known for his versatility and range, while her mother, Vanessa Paradis, is a French singer and actress who rose to fame in the 1980s.

Growing up in a multicultural environment, Depp was exposed to various languages and cultures from a young age.\n\nCareer\n---------\n\nDepp made her acting debut in 2014 with a minor role in the horror comedy film Tusk. However, it was her 2015 campaign as a brand ambassador for French fashion house Chanel that brought her into the spotlight.

Frank Herbert's 1965 novel Dune, on agreement to produce a film within nine years, but died in mid-1973, while plans for the film (including David Lean already attached to direct) were still in development [8] [9]\n\n\nEarly attempts and Jodorowsky's Dune\nAfter the book's initial success, producers began attempting to adapt it In mid-1971, film producer Arthur P Jacobs optioned the film rights to Frank Herbert's 1965 novel Dune, on agreement to produce a film within nine years, but died in mid-1973, while plans for the film (including David Lean already attached to direct) were still in development [8] [9]\n\n\nDe Laurentiis's first attempt\nIn late 1976, Italian producer Dino De Laurentiis purchased the rights for Dune from Gibon's consortium [8] De Laurentiis commissioned Herbert to write a new screenplay in 1978; the script Herbert turned in was 175 pages long, the equivalent of nearly three hours of screen time [8] De Laurentiis then hired director Ridley Scott in 1979, with Rudy Wurlitzer writing the screenplay and H R Giger retained from the Jodorowsky production [8] Scott intended to split the book into two movies He worked on three drafts of the script, using The Battle of Algiers (1966) as a point of reference, before moving on to direct another science-fiction film, Blade Runner (1982) He recalled the pre-production process was slow, and finishing the project would have been even more time-intensive:\n\n\nLynch's screenplay and direction\nIn 1981, the nine-year film rights were set to expire De Laurentiis renegotiated the rights from the author, adding to them the rights to the Dune sequels, written and unwritten [8] He then showed the book to Sid Sheinberg, president of MCA, the parent company of Universal City Studios, which approved the book After seeing The Elephant Man (1980), producer Raffaella De Laurentiis decided that David Lynch should direct the movie Around that time, Lynch received several other directing offers, including Return of the Jedi De Laurentiis contacted Lynch, who said he had not heard of the book After reading it and \"loving it\", he met with De Laurentiis and agreed to direct the film [14] [15] [16] Lynch worked on the script for six months with Eric Bergren and Christopher De Vore The team yielded two drafts of the script and split over creative differences Lynch then worked on five more drafts Initially, Lynch had scripted Dune across two films, but eventually it was condensed into a single film [8]\n\n\nEditing\nThe rough cut of Dune without post-production effects ran over four hours long, but Lynch's intended cut of the film (as reflected in the seventh and final draft of the script) was almost three hours long Universal and the film's financiers expected a standard, two-hour cut of the film Dino De Laurentiis, his daughter Raffaella, and Lynch excised numerous scenes, filmed new scenes that simplified or concentrated plot elements, and added voice-over narrations, plus a new introduction by Virginia Madsen Contrary to rumor, Lynch made no other version than the theatrical cut [25]\n\n\nVersions\nA television version was aired in 1988 in two parts totaling 186 minutes; it replaced Madsen's opening monolog with a much longer description of the setting that used concept art stills Lynch disavowed this version and had his name removed from the credits Alan Smithee was credited, a pseudonym used by directors who wish to disavow a film  The extended and television versions additionally credit writer Lynch as Judas Booth  This version (without recap and second credit roll) has previously been released on DVD as Dune: Extended Edition.\n\n\nCanceled sequels\nWhen production started, it was anticipated for the film to launch a Dune franchise, and plans had been made to film two sequels back-to-back Many of the props were put into storage after the completion of production in anticipation of future use, MacLachlan had signed for a two-film deal, and Lynch had begun writing a screenplay for the second film Once Dune was released and failed at the box office, the sequel plans were canceled.\n\n\nRelease\nDune premiered in Washington, DC,

with deaf characters that are small business owners and leaders in their fishing community, with depth and nuance that rival and even exceed that of their hearing counterparts in the story.\" Deaf writer Sara Nović also said, \"I liked that these characters were sexual beings—deaf and disabled people are often neutered or virginal in movies and books, and that's extremely boring and inaccurate.\" [46]\n\n\nLegacy\nIn 2023, Screen Rant ranked it number 5 on its list of \"The 10 Best Movies of the 2020s (So Far),\" writing that \"Every so often, there is a small indie movie that

scheduled yet to be announced DJ Kurs, Deaf West's artistic director, expressed excitement for the project: \"As a Deaf person, I knew from the start that CODA would make a perfect musical: It addresses our relationship with music and how we move through the world of sound like immigrants in a foreign country, learning new, seemingly arbitrary rules on the fly.\" Like Deaf West's production of Spring Awakening, the musical will incorporate both signing in American Sign Language and live singing [61]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en",

Soviet Socialist Republic Starting with an interview given in 2009, Lukashenko has said that his actual birthday is 31 August, the same as his son's Nikolai's [17] This caused some confusion as all official sources had said 30 August 1954 up until then An explanation was later given that his mother had entered the hospital on the 30th in labour but not given birth until after midnight [18]\n\n\nMilitary and early politics career\nHe served in the Soviet Border Troops from 1975 to 1977, where he was an instructor of the political department of military unit No 2187 of the Western Frontier District in Brest and in the Soviet Army from 1980 to 1982 In addition, he led an All-Union Leninist Young Communist League (Komsomol) chapter in Mogilev from 1977 to 1978 While in the Soviet Army, Lukashenko was a deputy political officer of the 120th Guards Motor Rifle Division, which was based in Minsk [23]\n\n\nPresidency\nA new Belarusian constitution enacted in early 1994 paved the way for the first democratic presidential election on 23 June and 10 July Six candidates stood in the first round, including Lukashenko, who campaigned as an independent on a populist platform In an interview with The New York Times, he declared: \"I am neither with the leftists nor the rightists But with the people against those who rob and deceive them.\" [29] Stanislav Shushkevich and Vyacheslav Kebich also ran, with the latter regarded as the clear favorite [30] Lukashenko won 45.1% of the vote while Kebich received 17.4%, Zianon Pazniak received 12.9% and Shushkevich, along with two other candidates, received less than 10% of votes [30]\n\n\nFirst term (1994–2001)\nA new Belarusian constitution enacted in early 1994 paved the way for the first democratic presidential election

increase industrial output of Belarus [51] Lukashenko won in the first round with 75.65% of the vote The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said the election process \"failed to meet international standards\" [51]\n\n\nThird term (2006–2010)\nAfter Lukashenko confirmed he was running for re-election in 2005, opposition groups began to seek a single candidate On 16 October 2005, on the Day of Solidarity with Belarus, the political groups Zubr and Third Way Belarus encouraged all opposition parties to rally behind one candidate to oppose Lukashenko in the 2006 election Their chosen candidate was Alexander Milinkevich [57] Lukashenko reacted by saying that anyone going to opposition protests would have their necks wrung \"as one might a duck\" [20] On 19 March 2006,

envisaged for 2011, an earlier date was approved \"to ensure the maximum participation of citizens in the electoral campaign and to set most convenient time for the voters\" [74] The run-up to the campaign was marked by a series of Russian media attacks on Lukashenko [75] The Central Election Committee said that all nine opposition figures were likely to get less than half the vote total that Lukashenko would get [76] Though opposition figures alleged intimidation [77] and that \"dirty tricks\" were being played, the election was seen as comparatively open as a result of desire to improve relations with both Europe and the US [76]\n\n\nFifth term (2015–2020)\nOn 11 October 2015, Lukashenko was elected for his fifth term as the president of Belarus Just over three weeks later, he was

[160] John Sweeney summarised Lukashism as \"a mutant version of the Soviet Union's deal with its people: they pretend to pay us, and we pretend to work; we pretend to vote for him; he pretends that the vote is fair\" [161]\n\n\nEconomy\nLukashenko's early economic policies aimed to prevent issues that occurred in other post-Soviet states, such as the establishment of oligarchic structures and mass unemployment [172] The unemployment rate for the country at the end of 2011 was at 0.6% of the population (of 6.86 million eligible workers), a decrease from 1995, when unemployment was 2.9% with a working-eligible population of 5.24 million [173] The per-capita gross national income rose from US$1,423 in 1993 to US$5,830 at the end of 2011 [174]\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Lukashenko stated that concerns about the pandemic were a \"frenzy and a psychosis\" and that working the tractors, drinking vodka and going to saunas could prevent people from infection from the virus \"People are working in tractors No one is talking about the virus\", Lukashenko said on 16 March 2020 \"There, the tractor will heal everyone The fields heal everyone\" He also said: \"I don't drink, but recently I've been saying that people should not only wash their hands with vodka, but also poison the virus with it You should drink the equivalent of 40–50 milliliters of rectified spirit daily\", but he advised against doing so while at work Lukashenko described these comments as a joke [186] [187] [188] By early May, Belarus was reported to have 15,000 diagnosed cases, one of the highest per capita rates of infection in Eastern Europe [189]\n\n\nPolitical repression\nOn 1 September 2020, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights

Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which linked senior Belarusian officials to the cases of disappearances, were confiscated [205]\n\n\nAssassination plans on dissidents abroad\nOn 4 January 2021, the EU Observer reported that new evidence, including documents and audio recordings, provide that Belarusian secret services planned to murder dissidents abroad [208] An audio file,

his policies towards domestic opponents Lukashenko's repression of opponents caused him to be called \"Europe's last dictator\" and resulted in the EU imposing visa sanctions on him and a range of Belarusian officials At times, the EU has lifted sanctions as a way to encourage dialogue or gain concessions from Lukashenko [228] Since the EU adopted this policy of \"change through engagement\", it has supported economic and political reforms to help integrate the Belarusian state [229]\n\n\nUnited States\nIn March 2003, Lukashenko said that Belarus unanimously condemned the US-led Iraq War

Lukashenko**\n\nAlexander Lukashenko is the current President of Belarus, serving since 1994. He was born on 30 August 1954 in the settlement of Kopys, Vitebsk Region, Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. His early life, family, and education will be discussed in the following sections.\n\n**Early life, family and education**\n\nLukashenko was born on 30 August 1954 in the settlement of Kopys, Vitebsk Region, Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. Starting with an interview given in 2009, Lukashenko has said that his actual birthday is 31 August, the same as his son's Nikolai's. This caused some confusion as all official sources had said 30 August 1954 up until then. An explanation was later given that his mother had entered the hospital on the 30th in labour but not given birth until after midnight.\n\nLukashenko's father, Vladimir, was a tractor driver and his mother, Naděžda, was a teacher. He was the second of three children. Lukashenko's family lived in a communal apartment in the village of Kopys, where he spent his early childhood. In 1964, Lukashenko's family moved to the village of Shklov, where he completed his primary education.\n\nLukashenko attended the Shklov Secondary School, graduating in 1970. He was an above-average student, particularly in mathematics and physics. After completing his secondary education, Lukashenko was accepted into the Belarusian State Agricultural Academy, where he studied mechanical engineering. He graduated in 1975 with a degree in mechanics and agricultural engineering.\n\n**Military and early politics career**\n\nLukashenko served in the Soviet Border Troops from 1975 to 1977, where he was an instructor of the political department of military unit No 2187 of the Western Frontier District in Brest. In addition, he led an All-Union Leninist Young Communist League (Komsomol) chapter in Mogilev from 1977 to 1978. While in the Soviet Army, Lukashenko was a deputy political officer of the 120th Guards Motor Rifle Division, which was based in Minsk.\n\n**Presidency**\n\nA new Belarusian constitution enacted in early 1994 paved the way for the first democratic presidential election on 23 June and 10 July. Six candidates stood in the first round, including Lukashenko, who campaigned as an independent on a populist platform. Stanislav Shushkevich and Vyacheslav Kebich also ran, with the latter regarded as the clear favorite. Lukashenko won 45.1% of the vote while Kebich received 17.4%, Zianon Pazniak received 12.9% and Shushkevich, along with two other candidates, received less than 10% of votes.\n\n**First term (1994–2001)**\n\nLukashenko's first term as President was marked by a series of tumultuous events. In 1995, Lukashenko dissolved the Supreme Soviet, which led to a constitutional crisis. The international community condemned Lukashenko's actions, and several countries imposed economic sanctions on Belarus.\n\n**Second term (2001–2006)**\n\nUnder the original constitution, Lukashenko should have been up for reelection in 1999. However, the 1996 referendum extended Lukashenko's term for two additional years. In the 9 September 2001 election, Lukashenko faced Vladimir Goncharik and Sergei Gaidukevich. During the campaign, Lukashenko promised to raise the standards of farming, social benefits, and increase industrial output of Belarus. Lukashenko won in the first round with 75.65% of the vote. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said the election process \"failed to meet international standards\".\n\n**Third term (2006–2010)**\n\nAfter Lukashenko confirmed he was running for re-election in 2005, opposition groups began to seek a single candidate. On 16 October 2005, on the Day of Solidarity with Belarus, the political groups Zubr and Third Way Belarus encouraged all opposition parties to rally behind one candidate to oppose Lukashenko in the 2006 election. Their chosen candidate was Alexander Milinkevich. Lukashenko reacted by saying that anyone going to opposition protests would have their necks wrung \"as one might a duck\". On 19 March 2006, exit polls showed Lukashenko winning a third term in a landslide, amid opposition reports of vote-rigging and fear of violence.\n\n**Fourth term (2010–2015)**\n\nLukashenko was one of ten candidates registered for the presidential election held in Belarus on 19 December 2010. The run-up to the campaign was marked by a series of Russian media attacks on Lukashenko. The Central Election Committee said that all nine opposition figures were likely to get less than half the vote total that Lukashenko would get.\n\n**Fifth term (2015–2020)**\n\nOn 11 October 2015, Lukashenko was elected for his fifth term as the President of Belarus. Just over three weeks later, he was inaugurated in the Independence Palace in the presence of attendees such as former president of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma, Chairman of the Russian Communist Party Gennady Zyuganov, and Belarusian biathlete Darya Domracheva.\n\n**Sixth term (2020–present)**\n\nOn 9 August 2020, according to the preliminary count, Lukashenko was re-elected for his sixth term as the President of Belarus. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned that the election was \"not free or fair\".\n\n**Domestic policy**\n\nThe political system of Lukashenko has become colloquially known as \"Lukashism\" or \"Lukashenkoism\". John Sweeney summarized Lukashism as \"a mutant version of the Soviet Union's deal with its people: they pretend to pay us, and we pretend to work; we pretend to vote for him; he pretends that the vote is fair\".\n\n**Economy**\n\nLukashenko's early economic policies aimed to prevent issues that occurred in other post-Soviet states, such as the establishment of oligarchic structures and mass unemployment. The unemployment rate for the country at the end of 2011 was at 0.6% of the population (of 6.86 million eligible workers), a decrease from 1995, when unemployment was 2.9% with a working-eligible population of 5.24 million.\n\n**COVID-19 pandemic**\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Lukashenko stated that concerns about the pandemic were a \"frenzy and a psychosis\" and that working the tractors, drinking vodka, and going to saunas could prevent people from infection from the virus.\n\n**Political repression**\n\nOn 1 September 2020, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) declared that its experts received reports of 450 documented cases of torture and ill-treatment of people who were arrested during the protests following the presidential election.\n\n**Torture, sexual abuse, and other forms of repression**\n\nOn 1 September 2020, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) declared that its experts received reports of 450 documented cases of torture and ill-treatment of people who were arrested during the protests following the presidential election.\n\n**Forced disappearances**\n\nIn 1999 opposition leaders Yury Zacharanka and Viktar Hanchar together with his business associate Anatol Krasouski disappeared. Hanchar and Krasouski disappeared the same day of a broadcast on state television in which President Alexander Lukashenko ordered the chiefs of his security services to crack down on \"opposition scum\".\n\n**Assassination plans on dissidents abroad**\n\nOn 4 January 2021, the EU Observer reported that new evidence, including documents and audio recordings, provide that Belarusian secret services planned to murder dissidents abroad.\n\n**Allegations of state-sponsored hijacking**\n\nOn 23 May 2021, Lukashenko personally ordered Ryanair Flight 4978 en route from Athens to Vilnius, carrying the opposition journalist Roman Protasevich, to land in Belarus.\n\n**Foreign policy**\n\nIn the 1990s, Lukashenko and the then-Russian president Boris Yeltsin envisaged the formation of a Union State. After Yeltsin anointed Putin as his successor, Lukashenko stalled the merger.\n\n**Russia**\n\nIn the 1990s, Lukashenko and the then-Russian president Boris Yeltsin envisaged the formation of a Union State. After Yeltsin anointed Putin as his successor, Lukashenko stalled the merger.\n\n**European Union**\n\nLukashenko's relationship with the EU has been strained, in part by choice and in part by his policies towards domestic opponents.\n\n**United States**\n\nIn March 2003, Lukashenko said that Belarus unanimously condemned the US-led Iraq War.\n\n**China**\n\nUnder Lukashenko, China and Belarus have maintained close ties, with him advocating an approach of \"understanding China, learning from China, and approaching China\".\n\n**Middle East**\n\nFollowing the 2014 Syrian presidential election, President Lukashenko congratulated President Bashar al-Assad.\n\n**Others**\n\nHis policies have been praised by some other world leaders. In response to a question about Belarus's domestic policies, President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela said \"We see here a model social state like the one we are beginning to create\".\n\n**Public life**\n\nLukashenko has made several controversial statements during his presidency which have been regarded as antisemitic, homophobic, and misogynistic.\n\n**Accusations of corruption**\n\nA film produced by Nexta, a Belarusian media service based in Poland, accuses Lukashenko of misappropriating EU funds on residences and automobiles.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nLukashenko married Galina Zhelnerovich, his high school sweetheart, in 1975. They have two sons, Viktor and Dmitry. Lukashenko has been seen on public occasions with various women.\n\n**Sports**\n\nLukashenko used to play football, but stopped playing during his presidency.

The system is divided into three broad categories: commissioned officers, junior commissioned officers, and non-commissioned officers. This article provides an overview of the current rank hierarchy, including the history of the system, the structure, and the insignia associated with each rank.\n\n**History**\n\nUpon the establishment of India's independence in 1947, the country became a dominion within the British Commonwealth of Nations. However, the armed forces, namely, the British Indian Army (IA), the Royal Indian Navy (RIN), and the Royal Indian Air Force (RIAF), retained their respective pre-independence ranks and corresponding insignia. In the Army's case, the service retained its pre-independence insignia, comprising the Tudor Crown and four-pointed Bath Star, called the pip.\n\nIn May 1949, Lord Mountbatten, the inaugural Governor-General of India, dispatched a note to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, titled Names and Insignia of Indian Armed Forces, containing a list of suggestions regarding the nomenclature of the armed forces that were to be enforced upon the dominion's conversion to a republic. In the note, Mountbatten proposed that the Tudor Crown, worn on the epaulettes of ranks of Majors and above, should be replaced by the Lion Capital of Ashoka and that the pip should be replaced by the Star of India or another form of star.\n\n**Structure**\n\nThe Army's rank hierarchy is divided into three broad categories:\n\n### **Group-A: Commissioned Officers (Officers)**\n\nThe Army has ten commissioned officer (officer) ranks, which are designated as Group-A service ranks and are equivalent to the All India Services. Commissioned officers are the leaders of the army and command anywhere from Platoon, Company, Battalion, Brigade, Division, Corps, and the whole army.\n\n### **Group-B: Junior Commissioned Officers (JCO)**\n\nJunior commissioned officers are promoted from non-commissioned officers and are broadly equivalent to warrant officers in the British Army. Senior non-commissioned officers are promoted to JCO rank on the basis of merit and seniority, restricted by the number of vacancies. In between the Commissioned Officer and the NCOs lies the Junior Commissioned Officers. They are treated with great respect as they have a minimum of 28 yrs and over service and are referred to as Sahab by all ranks.\n\n### **Other: Non-Commissioned Officers (NCO)**\n\nNon-Commissioned Officers (\"NCOs\") are soldiers promoted to positions of responsibility and are equivalent to junior non-commissioned officers (sergeants and corporals) in Western armies. A sepoy is a rank equivalent to Private in most Commonwealth armies. Many regiments and corps use other distinctive and descriptive names instead of sepoys. These distinctive equivalents for Sepoy include:\n\n* Honorary ranks\n* Brevet\n\n### **Honorary Ranks**\n\nHonorary ranks and honor, also called brevet, are granted in the Indian Army, and its branches such as India Territorial Army (TA), for various reasons. These ranks may not entitle the rank holder to pay, pension, or perks (e.g., ranks given to celebrities).\n\n### **Retiring Soldiers**\n\nExemplary soldiers who are about to retire are given honorary ranks, usually a few days before their retirement, although these ranks can be granted at any time. Examples include the grant of the rank of Field Marshal, which is rarely granted. Most frequently, honorary ranks that are granted are those of junior commissioned officers, which are granted 1 or 2 weeks before retirement.\n\n### **Prominent Citizens as Brand Ambassadors**\n\nIn order to inspire Indian youths to join the Indian Army, and to acknowledge contribution towards the nation, honorary ranks are awarded to the accomplished and eminent personalities who act as brand ambassadors for the defence forces.\n\n### **Foreign Trainees of India's Military Academies**\n\nReciprocal awarding of honorary ranks to other nations is also practiced. For instance, the Indian Army has awarded honorary ranks to officers of the Nepal Army.\n\n### **British Colonial Era: Indian Army Ranks to British Army**\n\nDuring the British colonial era, the Indian Army's rank hierarchy was similar to that of the British Army. The British Army's rank hierarchy was adopted by the Indian Army, with some modifications.\n\n### **Retired Officers: Form of Address**\n\nRetired officers are addressed as \"Shri\" or \"Mahoday\" followed by their name and rank. For example, \"Shri Kedia, Brigadier\" or \"Mahoday Kedia, Brigadier\".\n\n### **See Also**\n\nThe rank hierarchy of the Indian Army is complex and has undergone changes over the years. The system is influenced by the country's colonial past and its transition to independence. The system is divided into three broad categories: commissioned officers, junior commissioned officers, and non-commissioned officers. The rank hierarchy is similar to that of the British Army, with some modifications. Honorary ranks are awarded to officers who have rendered exceptional service. The system is governed by the Indian Army Act, 1950.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Army_ranks_and_insignia_of_India\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nUpon the establishment of India's independence in 1947, the country became a dominion within the British Commonwealth of Nations Nevertheless, the armed forces, namely, the British Indian Army (IA), the Royal Indian Navy (RIN) and the Royal Indian Air Force (RIAF) - under the helm of King George VI as the Commander-in-Chief - retained their respective pre-independence ranks and corresponding insignia [1] In the Army's case, the service retained its pre-independence insignia, comprising the Tudor Crown and four-pointed Bath Star, called the pip.\n\n\n1947–1950\nUpon the establishment of India's independence in 1947, the country became a dominion within the British Commonwealth of Nations Nevertheless, the armed forces, namely, the British Indian Army (IA), the Royal Indian Navy (RIN) and the Royal Indian Air Force (RIAF) - under the helm of King George VI as the Commander-in-Chief - retained their respective pre-independence ranks and corresponding insignia [1] In the Army's case, the service retained its pre-independence insignia, comprising the Tudor Crown and four-pointed Bath Star, called the pip.\n\n\n1950–present\nIn May 1949, Lord Mountbatten, the inaugural Governor-General of India, dispatched a note to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, titled Names and Insignia of Indian Armed Forces, containing a list of suggestions regarding the nomenclature of the armed forces that were to be enforced upon the dominion's conversion to a republic [2] In the note, Mountbatten proposed that the Tudor Crown, worn on the epaulettes of ranks of Majors and above should be replaced by the Lion Capital of Ashoka and that the pip should be replaced by the Star of India or another form of star [2]\n\n\nStructure\nPresently, the Army's rank hierarchy is divided into three broad categories: [4]\nGroup-A: Commissioned Officers (Officers)\nGroup-B: Junior Commissioned Officers (JCO)\nOther: Non-Commissioned Officers (NCO)\n\n\nCommissioned Officers\nThe Army has ten commissioned officer (officer) ranks, which are designated as Group-A service ranks and are equivalent to the All India Services.\n\n\nJunior commissioned officer and non-commissioned ranks\nThe rank of Second Lieutenant is no longer in use;

The rivalry has been ongoing since the early 2000s and has become one of the most enduring and high-profile rivalries in sports history.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Messi-Ronaldo rivalry is a clash between two of the greatest soccer players of all time, with both individuals having achieved unparalleled success in their careers. Messi and Ronaldo have dominated the sport for over a decade, with both players winning numerous individual and team awards, including multiple Ballon d'Or awards and UEFA Champions League titles. The rivalry has sparked intense media attention, with many considering it one of the greatest rivalries in sports history.\n\n**History**\n\nThe rivalry between Messi and Ronaldo began in the early 2000s, when both players were rising stars in the soccer world. In 2007, Ronaldo and Messi finished as runners-up to AC Milan's Kaká in both the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year awards. In an interview that year, Messi was quoted as saying that \"Cristiano Ronaldo is an extraordinary player and it would be brilliant to be in the same team as him.\"\n\n**Origins**\n\nThe rivalry between Messi and Ronaldo can be attributed to their on-field competition, particularly in the UEFA Champions League. The two players have faced each other numerous times in the competition, with both players scoring hat-tricks and breaking records. The rivalry has been fueled by the media, with many considering it a clash between two of the greatest players of all time.\n\n**El Clásico**\n\nThe El Clásico rivalry between Barcelona and Real Madrid has been a major factor in the Messi-Ronaldo rivalry. The two players have faced each other numerous times in El Clásico matches, with both players scoring crucial goals and breaking records.

Screened during the 2012 Sundance Film Festival, Winstead's performance earned her rave reviews, with JoBlo.com calling it: \"the type of performance that could be Award-worthy if given the right kind of build-up by whichever studio picks it up.\" The film was released theatrically on October 12, 2012, and saw Winstead snagging the Dallas International Film Festival Award for Best Actress.\n\n**1997-2004**\n\nWinstead appeared in a production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat starring Donny Osmond. After her brief performance in that show, Winstead began making appearances in various television series and earned guest roles in Touched by an Angel and Promised Land. She gained her first major role as Jessica Bennett in the NBC soap opera Passions, from 1999 to 2000. She left to pursue other interests, later stating, \"I really had one of the smallest roles on Passions, so I didn't get too involved.. I was able to leave pretty easily.\" Winstead's next significant television role was in the short-lived CBS drama series Wolf Lake (2001-02), as the daughter of Tim Matheson's character. The series was canceled after ten episodes. In 2004, Winstead played a supporting role in MTV's made-for-television film Monster Island. She was offered a role in the film A Cinderella Story, but turned it down as she had just graduated from school and was going on a cruise with friends (where she met Riley Stearns, her future husband).\n\n**2005-2011**\n\nFollowing a minor role in the indie comedy Checking Out (2005), she took on a larger role as a school senior turned the main antagonist in the Walt Disney Pictures film Sky High, about an airborne school for teenage superheroes. Winstead said of her role, \"I bounced around I was either the hero of the sidekicks or the sidekick to the heroes.\" The film was released on July 29, 2005, receiving favorable reviews, and budgeted at US$35 million, it grossed US$63.9 million domestically.\n\n**2012-2014**\n\nWinstead appeared opposite Aaron Paul in Smashed, an independent drama directed by James Ponsoldt about a married alcoholic couple (Paul and Winstead) whose relationship is put to test when the wife decides to get sober. She said that the film was shot in 19 days. Screened during the 2012 Sundance Film Festival, Winstead's performance earned her rave reviews, with JoBlo.com calling it: \"the type of performance that could be Award-worthy if given the right kind of build-up by whichever studio picks it up.\" The film was released theatrically on October 12, 2012, and saw Winstead snagging the Dallas International Film Festival Award for Best Actress.\n\nDuring a promotional interview for the movie with website Collider, she expressed pride in working on an independent project: \"It's something I've been trying to do for years and years  [...] It's almost like my first movie in a weird way, cause it's my first movie in this world, which is a world I've been trying to break into  [I've wanted] to be around filmmakers that are trying new things and not part of the system, so to speak, and they're doing things on their own terms.\"\n\n**2015-Present**\n\nBy January 2015, Winstead had been already cast as a series regular on A&E's U.S remake of the French drama series The Returned, with Sandrine Holt and Agnes Bruckner. The adapted show followed residents in a small town whose lives are disrupted when people who have been dead for many years begin reappearing. It premiered on March 9, 2015, for a 10-episode run, to mostly critical acclaim. The series was canceled after its first season, though, due to low ratings. Also in 2015, she made a guest-appearance on the August 6 episode of IFC's Comedy Bang! Bang! (\"Mary Elizabeth Winstead Wears an A-Line Skirt and Pointy Black Boots\").\n\n**Singing**\n\nWinstead has expressed her interest in singing, but initially did not plan on pursuing it as a career. \"I wasn't ever really going to be a singer, but it's just something I've always loved.\" For her part in 2007's Death Proof, Tarantino had Winstead sing an a cappella cover of The Shirelles' hit recording \"Baby It's You.\" She was asked without warning to perform the song and the cast were reportedly \"gob-smacked\" by her singing. Winstead and music producer Thai Long Ly eventually co-wrote a song, called \"Warmth of Him.\" Although first rumored to be a pre-release single, Winstead confirmed that she was just exploring her interest and did not plan at the time on releasing any music albums.\n\n**Got a Girl**\n\nIn an interview with Complex magazine for the June/July 2012 issue, Winstead revealed she was working with Dan the Automator and was indeed planning on releasing a music album. The duo formed the band Got a Girl the following year, and released their demo \"You & Me\" on May 21, 2013. The album, titled I Love You but I Must Drive Off This Cliff Now, was released on July 22, 2014, via Bulk Recordings. The first single, \"Did We Live Too Fast\" premiered on June 3, and its music video, directed by Hope Larson, premiered online on June 16. The album features heavy influences of French pop music, with Winstead detailing that the inspiration behind the project came from \"French '60s pop—Jane Birkin, and stuff like that. It's kind of married with Dan's sensibility, which is his beats and a little bit of that low-key hip-hop vibe. So it makes for something that's very unique; it's very lounge-y and light. It's got a little bit of a French quality.\"\n\n**Guest Appearances**\n\nWinstead was also featured on the songs \"The Agony\" and \"Look Across The Sky\" on Deltron 3030's second studio album Event 2, released on September 30, 2013.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nIn 2010, Winstead married filmmaker Riley Stearns, whom she had met at age eighteen on an ocean cruise. She starred in and produced Stearns's debut feature film, Faults, in 2014. She announced their separation in May 2017, and their divorce was finalized later that year.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* Feature films:\n\t+ The Ring (2002)\n\t+ Sky High (2005)\n\t+ Death Proof (2007)\n\t+ Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010)\n\t+ Smashed (2012)\n\t+ A Horrible Way to Die (2010)\n\t+ Faults (2014)\n* Television:\n\t+ Passions (1999-2000)\n\t+ Wolf Lake (2001-02)\n\t+ The Returned (2015)\n* Music videos:\n\t+ \"Baby It's You\" (2007)\n\t+ \"Warmth of Him\" (2007)\n\t+ \"Did We Live Too Fast\" (2014)\n* Awards and nominations:\n\t+ Dallas International Film Festival Award for Best Actress (2012)\n\t+ Nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television (2015)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mary_Elizabeth_Winstead\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nMary Elizabeth Winstead was born on November 28, 1984, in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, to Betty Lou (née Knight) and James Ronald Winstead [1] [2] and is the youngest of five children [3] Her grandfather, Ambler William Winstead, was a cousin of actress Ava Gardner [4] When she was five years old, her family moved to Sandy, Utah, [2] [5] where she attended Peruvian Park Elementary and took advanced classes [5] She studied dance in a Joffrey Ballet summer program in Chicago [5] and sang in the International Children's Choir [6] During her youth, she hoped to pursue a career as a ballerina and appeared in local ballet productions [5] As she entered her teens, she was forced to quit ballet due to her height She later said, \"I realized pretty early on that I was already too tall by the time I was 13..

{"title": "Zubayr_ibn_al-Awwam", "content": "\nAncestry and early life\nHis father was the brother of Khadija, Al-Awwam ibn Khuwaylid of the Asad clan of the Quraysh tribe His mother was Muhammad's aunt, Safiyya bint Abd al-Muttalib Hence Zubayr was Muhammad's first cousin and brother in law [14]: 75 \n\n\nConversion to Islam\nZubayr is said to have entered Islam at the age of 16 He was one of the first men to accept Islam under the influence of Abu Bakr, [17]: 115  and is said to have been the fourth or fifth adult male convert [14]: 76 \n\n\nMilitary career\nZubayr served as one of three main commanders of the Muslim forces in the Battle of Badr, along with Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib and Ali [20] In the course of the battle, he killed the Quraish champion Ubayda ibn Sa'id Umayya clan [21] According to some accounts Zubayr also killed Nawfal ibn Khuwaylid, [4] although others credit his death to Ali [22]\n\n\nBattle of the Trench\nDuring the Battle of the Trench, Zubayr fought and killed Nawfal ibn Abdullah ibn Mughirah al Makhzumi in a duel [27] [Notes 3] However, other chroniclers such as Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani recorded the man killed by Zubayr as Uthman ibn Mughirah al Makhzumi [28] The Muslim defenders cheered and praised the sharpness of the sword which Zubayr used, only for Zubayr to reply that it is not his sword which need to be complimented, but the strength of the arm which held the sword [29] Zubayr caused the enemy horsemens to flee after he strike the horse of Qurayshite warrior named Hubayr ibn Abi Wahb al Makhzumi, cutting the horse armour and crupper of Hubayr horse [30] Zubayr also played a reconnaissance role when he volunteered to spy on the Qurayza tribe for Muhammad The latter then praised Zubayr: \"Every Prophet has a disciple, and my disciple is Al-Zubayr.\" [14]: 79 \n\n\nPledge of the Tree\nIn March 628 CE (6 AH), Muhammad set out for Mecca to perform the ritual pilgrimage of Umrah [31] [4] The Quraysh denied the Muslims entry into the city and posted themselves outside Mecca, determined to offer resistance even though the Muslims did not have any intention or preparation for battle, which caused Muhammad to send Uthman ibn Affan as his envoy to meet with the leaders of Quraysh and negotiate their entry into the city [4] [31] The Quraysh had Uthman stay longer in Mecca than they originally planned, which caused Muhammad to believe that Uthman had been killed [4] In response, Muhammad gathered his nearly 1,400 Sahaba and called them to pledge to fight until death and avenge the death of Uthman [4] After the pledge, verses were revealed in the Qur'an commemorating and appreciating the pledge and those who made it:\n\n\nBattle of Khaybar\nIn 628, Zubayr participated in the Battle of Khaybar, [32] defeating the Jewish champion Yassir in single combat Afterward, the Muslims commented on how sharp his sword must have been; Zubayr replied that it had not been sharp but he had used it with great force [17]: 513–514  Later during the battle, Zubayr fought and killed another opposing champion in a duel [33] After the Muslims had conquered any [clarification needed] of these eight Khaybar fortresses, the Jewish treasurer, Kinana, was brought to Muhammad, but he refused to reveal where their money was hidden However, later Muhammad ibn Maslama decapitated Kinana, in retaliation for his brother Mahmud, [17]: 515  [34]: 330–331  who had been killed in the battle a few days earlier [17]: 511  [34]: 322–324  Zubayr was later made one of the eighteen chiefs who each supervised the

the area in Moab, he sent Zubayr and Fadl ibn Abbas to subdue the city of Amman [53] Waqidi recorded that Said ibn Aamir al-Jumahi testified that during the battle, he saw in the front of Muslim army Zubayr and Fadl fighting ferociously against the Byzantines atop of their horses Said ibn Amir followed by saying that the Rashidun army butchered the fleeing Byzantine soldiers, while some were captured as prisoners of war [54] [55] Then Zubair managed to kill the Byzantine commander Nicetas and subdued the city of Amman [53]\n\n\nBattle of the Yarmuk\nLater, Zubayr participated in the Battle of the Yarmuk in 636 [56] In the battle, Zubayr was placed on the left wing commanded by Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan, leading his personal squadron among other dozen [clarification needed] squadrons of the left wing [57] Zubayr twice charged alone against the row of Byzantine soldiers, breaking up their ranks and suffering a heavy shoulder injury in the process [27] [4] Abdullah ibn Zubayr, who at that time was still a child and was carried on his father's chest, [4] [29] [58] testified that his father was doing the salah prayer on top of his camel while fighting the enemy at the same time

the caliph assembled his council, including Zubayr, Ali, and Talhah, about the battle plan to face the Persian army of Rostam Farrokhzad in Qadisiyyah [63] At first the caliph himself led the forces (including Zubayr) from Arabia to Iraq, [63] but the council urges Umar not to lead the army and instead appoint someone else, as his presence was needed more urgently in the capital [63] Umar agreed and asked the council to suggest the commander to lead the army The council agreed to send Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas; Sa'd served as the overall commander on Persian conquest and won the Battle of al-Qadisiyyah [63]\n\n\nCampaign in North Africa\nAfter the conquest of Jerusalem caliph Umar stayed for while in Jerusalem, [73] Amr ibn al-As, who at that time was in Egypt besieging a Byzantine fortress, sent a message to Umar asking for reinforcements of exactly 8,000 soldiers However, since at the moment the available manpower of the caliphate was strained, the caliph was only able to send 4,000 soldiers, led by four commanders [Notes 7] [Notes 8] The four commanders were two veteran Muhajireen, Zubayr and Miqdad ibn Aswad, and two Ansari commanders named Maslama ibn Mukhallad al-Ansari and Ubadah ibn al-Samit [29] However, Baladhuri, Ibn al-Athir and Ibn Sa'd recorded that the four commander were Zubayr, Busr ibn Abi Artat, Umayr ibn Wahb, and Kharija ibn Hudhafa [76] [77] [78] [Notes 9]\n\n\nConquest of al-Bahnasa\nLater in 639, the Rashidun forces marched south to the Byzantine city named Oxyrhynchus (al-Bahnasa in Arabic) [87] 'Amr delegated Khalid ibn al-Walid to lead

right middle, ring, and pinky fingers while pointing the index finger and putting the thumb above the clasped middle finger, [116] whether to sit down while eating and drinking, [117] prohibiting

Zubayr as one of their source of fatawa, such as an act of government to spying any endangering act from enemy of the state, such as criminal behavior, alleged terrorism, and other illegal conduct [126] The committee based this ruling of espionage from the act of Zubayr of spying on Banu Qurayza for their alleged betrayal during the Battle of the Trench on the instruction of Muhammad [126]\n\n\nRules of war\nZubayr's conduct has been influential on Islamic interpretation of the rules of war, such as the use of military deception, [128] the division of spoils of war at the Battle

prominence was Abu Yahya Mawla az-Zubayr [135] Daniel Pipes argued that the practice of early Muslims such as Zubayr and Uthman ibn Affan of owning massive number of slaves and casual manumissions was the first indication of Mamluk, an Islamic military slave system [136]\n\n\nDescendants\nZubayr's status as an early Muslim hero and model of religious piety prompted many ethnic communities across the world to claim themselves as his descendants particularly in Hejaz and Egypt The Zubairi community which dwells in India and Pakistan also claims Zubayr as their ancestor, as descendant clans of Zubayr allegedly migrated from their homeland to the Indian subcontinent during the Umayyad campaigns in India in the 7th century AD [137] [138] [139]\n\n\nPersonal characteristics\nZubayr is

ibn al-Awwam\n\n## Introduction\n\nZubayr ibn al-Awwam, also known as Zubayr, was a prominent companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and a prominent figure in the early history of Islam. He played a significant role in the military campaigns of the Rashidun Caliphate and was a close ally of the first two caliphs, Abu Bakr and Umar. Zubayr was also a respected leader and a skilled warrior, known for his bravery and military prowess.\n\n## Ancestry and Early Life\n\nZubayr's father was Al-Awwam ibn Khuwaylid, a member of the Asad clan of the Quraysh tribe. His mother was Safiyya bint Abd al-Muttalib, the aunt of Muhammad. This made Zubayr Muhammad's first cousin and brother-in-law. Zubayr was born in Mecca, Arabia, around 594 CE.\n\n## Conversion to Islam\n\nZubayr is believed to have entered Islam at the age of 16, under the influence of Abu Bakr. He was one of the first men to accept Islam and is said to have been the fourth or fifth adult male convert. Zubayr's conversion to Islam marked the beginning of his close relationship with Muhammad and his family.\n\n## Military Career\n\nZubayr played a significant role in the Battle of Badr, where he served as one of the three main commanders of the Muslim forces, along with Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib and Ali. During the battle, Zubayr killed the Quraish champion Ubayda ibn Sa'id Umayya clan. He also participated in the Battle of the Trench, where he fought and killed Nawfal ibn Abdullah ibn Mughirah al Makhzumi in a duel.\n\n## Battle of the Trench\n\nDuring the Battle of the Trench, Zubayr's bravery and military skills were put to the test. He fought and killed Nawfal ibn Abdullah ibn Mughirah al Makhzumi in a duel, and then struck the horse of Qurayshite warrior named Hubayr ibn Abi Wahb al Makhzumi, cutting the horse armor and crupper. Zubayr's actions during the battle were instrumental in the Muslim victory.\n\n## Pledge of the Tree\n\nIn March 628 CE, Muhammad set out for Mecca to perform the ritual pilgrimage of Umrah. The Quraysh denied the Muslims entry into the city and posted themselves outside Mecca, determined to offer resistance. Muhammad then sent Uthman ibn Affan as his envoy to meet with the leaders of Quraysh and negotiate their entry into the city. However, the Quraysh had Uthman stay longer in Mecca than they originally planned, which caused Muhammad to believe that Uthman had been killed. In response, Muhammad gathered his nearly 1,400 Sahaba and called them to pledge to fight until death and avenge the death of Uthman.\n\n## Battle of Khaybar\n\nIn 628, Zubayr participated in the Battle of Khaybar, where he defeated the Jewish champion Yassir in single combat. He later fought and killed another opposing champion in a duel. After the Muslims had conquered the fortresses of Khaybar, the Jewish treasurer, Kinana, was brought to Muhammad, but he refused to reveal where their money was hidden.\n\n## Conquest of Mecca until Death of Muhammad\n\nIn December 629, Zubayr and Ali brought back to Muhammad a letter from a spy intended for the Quraysh, making Muhammad confident that the Muslims would now take Mecca by surprise. When Muhammad entered Mecca, Zubayr held one of the three banners of the Emigrants and commanded the left wing of the conquering army.\n\n## During Rashidun Caliphate\n\nIn the third week of June 632, during the Ridda Wars, the rebel army under Tulayha moved from Dhu Qissa to Dhu Hussa, from where they prepared to launch an attack on Medina.

Zubayr personally gave his own vote to nominate Ali as caliph.\n\n## First Civil War and Zubayr's Death\n\nUthman was assassinated in 656. Zubayr had reason to hope that he would be elected as the next caliph, although he knew that his old ally Talha was also a strong contender. However, Ali was elected, to the debate of Muhammad's widow Aisha.

Mughirah al Makhzumi [28] The Muslim defenders cheered and praised the sharpness of the sword which Zubayr used, only for Zubayr to reply that it is not his sword which need to be complimented, but the strength of the arm which held the sword [29] Zubayr caused the enemy horsemens to flee after he strike the horse of Qurayshite warrior named Hubayr ibn Abi Wahb al Makhzumi, cutting the horse armour and crupper of Hubayr horse [30] Zubayr also played a reconnaissance role when he volunteered to spy on the Qurayza tribe for Muhammad The latter then praised Zubayr: \"Every Prophet has a

Zubayr as one of their source of fatawa, such as an act of government to spying any endangering act from enemy of the state, such as criminal behavior, alleged terrorism, and other illegal conduct [126] The committee based this ruling of espionage from the act of Zubayr of spying on Banu Qurayza for their alleged betrayal during the Battle of the Trench on the instruction of Muhammad [126]\n\n\nRules of war\nZubayr's conduct has been influential on Islamic interpretation of the rules of war, such as the use of military deception, [128] the division of spoils of war at the Battle of the Yarmuk, [129] the treatment of prisoners of war, [130] and the use of torture as a method of interrogation [131] [132]\n\n\nEntrepreneurship\nZubayr was known to be very wealthy as a result of his business career [14]: 80  His practice of offering loans with no interest became widespread in the Islamic world [133]\n\n\nManumission of slaves\nZubayr owned at least a thousand slaves and reportedly freed one each day Some of his ex-slaves became prominent in their own right, including Yarba ibn Rabban Mawla az-Zubayr, who became a scholar of hadith [134] Another slave who gained prominence was Abu Yahya Mawla az-Zubayr [135] Daniel Pipes argued that the practice of early Muslims such as Zubayr and Uthman ibn Affan of owning massive number of slaves and casual manumissions was the first indication of Mamluk, an Islamic military slave system [136]\n\n\nDescendants\nZubayr's status as an early Muslim hero and model of religious piety prompted many ethnic communities across the world to claim themselves as his descendants particularly in Hejaz and Egypt The Zubairi community which dwells in India and Pakistan also claims Zubayr as their ancestor, as descendant clans of Zubayr allegedly migrated from their homeland to the Indian subcontinent during the Umayyad campaigns in India in the 7th century AD [137] [138] [139]\n\n\nPersonal characteristics\nZubayr is described as of medium height, lean, dark-complexioned, and hairy, though with a thin beard His hair hung down to his shoulders, and he did not dye it after it turned white [14]: 80  One report described him as having had blue eyes [140] Other reports consider him burly and tall [4] Much of his body was covered with battle scars from his many military engagements [9] He was said to possess extraordinary physical strength, [27] As he was said being able to split an adult man body perfectly into two with a single blow of his sword [29]\n\n\nFamily\nZubayr married eight times and had twenty children [14]: 75 \n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nPrimary sources\n\n\nSecondary sources\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal online biography\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born in 1959, Kidd began his career at the age of 14 and has since become a household name in the world of motorcycle stunts.\n\n**Stunt Work**\n\nKidd started his career in the 1970s, performing stunts for various TV shows and films. He is credited with holding many world records for jumping over cars and buses, showcasing his exceptional skills and bravery as a motorcycle rider. Kidd's work as a stunt double has also been featured in numerous films, including The Living Daylights, Bullseye!, and GoldenEye, where he doubled for actors such as Timothy Dalton, Roger Moore, and Pierce Brosnan.\n\nOne of Kidd's most notable stunts was in the 1979 film Hanover Street, starring Harrison Ford. Doubling for Ford on a motorbike, Kidd jumped a 120 feet (37 m) railway cutting at 90 miles per hour (140 km/h) in Shepton Mallet, Somerset. This impressive feat showcased Kidd's ability to perform high-risk stunts with precision and skill. Kidd has also doubled for Val Kilmer in the 1984 film Top Secret!, further solidifying his reputation as a skilled stunt rider.\n\n**Jump Contest**\n\nIn 1993, Kidd participated in a high-profile motorcycle \"jump off\" competition against Robbie Knievel, the son of the famous daredevil Evel Knievel. The competition, titled The Daredevil Duel: Knievel vs Kidd, was held in Bay St Louis, Mississippi, USA and was broadcast as a pay-per-view event. Kidd's impressive performance earned him a six-foot victory over Knievel, securing his title as the world's top motorcycle jump rider.\n\nThis competition marked a significant moment in Kidd's career, as it showcased his exceptional skills and cemented his reputation as a leading figure in the world of motorcycle stunts. Although Kidd and Knievel did not compete against each other again, Kidd's title remains uncontested, a testament to his enduring talent and skill.\n\n**Accident**\n\nOn August 6, 1996, Kidd was involved in a serious motorcycle accident while performing at the Bulldog Bash, held at Long Marston Airfield near Stratford-upon-Avon. The accident occurred when Kidd attempted a relatively minor jump of approximately 15 m (49 ft) across a drag strip. However, the landing area beyond the drag strip consisted of an uphill incline leading to the edge of a steep embankment.\n\nAlthough Kidd completed the jump and landed the bike upright on two wheels, his chin struck the petrol tank of his motorcycle, causing him to become unconscious. As a result, he was unable to prevent himself and his bike from continuing up and over the 6 m (20 ft) embankment edge. Kidd sustained serious head and pelvic injuries in the resulting fall.\n\n**Later Career**\n\nAfter the accident, doctors told Kidd's parents that it was possible he could be in a coma for up to 10 years. However, Kidd regained consciousness within three months of the accident, but was left paralyzed and with brain damage. Despite these setbacks, Kidd continued to pursue his passion for motorcycle stunts, albeit in a more limited capacity.\n\nIn 2002, Kidd appeared in an episode of Russell Brand's TV documentary series RE:Brand, where he talked about his life after the accident. Kidd also took control of a motorcycle again when he formally opened the Beyond Boundaries Live 2007 Exhibition at Sandown Park, Esher on June 29, 2007.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nKidd was once married to dancer and actress Debbie Ash, the sister of actress Leslie Ash. The couple had one child before divorcing. Kidd later married Stringfellows waitress Sarah Carr, with whom he had one child before their divorce.\n\n**Popular Culture**\n\nA computer game based on Kidd's stunts, titled Eddie Kidd Jump Challenge, was released in 1984 by Martech. This game allowed players to experience Kidd's thrilling stunts and jumps, further solidifying his status as a household name in the world of motorcycle stunts.\n\nIn conclusion, Eddie Kidd is a British stunt performer with a long and illustrious career, marked by numerous record-breaking motorcycle jumps and his work as a stunt double in numerous films. Despite a serious accident in 1996, Kidd continued to pursue his passion for motorcycle stunts, albeit in a more limited capacity.

team, the QFA revealed that it had naturalized its first players in a February 1976 telegram sent to FIFA: Ezzuldin Osman of Sudan, Hassan Mukhtar of Egypt and Ryad Murad of Lebanon This practice of naturalizing Arabic-speaking foreigners to compete for the national team continued throughout the 20th century, albeit at a relatively slow rate [58] In 2004, FIFA cited the intention of three Brazilian players – Aílton, Dedé and Leandro – to play for the Qatar national team as the immediate trigger to their decision to tighten eligibility rules to ensure players have ties to the country they represent [59] [60]\n\n\nPlayer records\n  Champions    Runners-up    Third place  \n\n\nMost appearances\n  Champions    Runners-up    Third place  \n\n\nTop goalscorers\n  Champions

co-creator alongside Kurtzman in February 2016 [60] [61] Nicholas Meyer, writer and director of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982) and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991), also joined the series as a consulting producer [62] In March, Rod Roddenberry (the son of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry) and Trevor Roth of Roddenberry Entertainment also joined the series as executive producers [63] Fuller said working with people previously involved with Star Trek was \"really about making sure that we maintain authenticity\", and said Meyer—who is widely considered to have made the best Star Trek film in The Wrath of Khan—brought \"a clarity and a cleanliness to the storytelling\" [64]\n\n\nGretchen J. Berg and Aaron Harberts\nWith production set to begin in January 2017, \"careful deliberation\" was going into the series' production value and effects [74] Ted Sullivan joined as supervising writing producer, [75] [76] and CBS Interactive president Marc DeBevoise revealed that the episode order had been expanded to 15 episodes [77] [78] In June, CBS announced a new premiere date of September 24, 2017, [79] and Kurtzman said he had discussed future seasons with Fuller before the latter's departure Kurtzman promised that the series' \"set-up, character, big ideas,  [and] the big movement of the season\" were all true to Fuller's original plans [80] In August, Goldsman said future seasons would have a \"hybridized  [anthology] approach\" with each season having its own story arc and a mixture of new and familiar characters [10] Kurtzman added that the success of Discovery could lead to other new Star Trek series [81]\n\n\nAlex Kurtzman and Michelle Paradise\nAfter Kurtzman took over, the second season was on track for a January 2019 premiere [88] There was enough of a delay in production that CBS extended the season's episode count to 14 as a way to amortize the cost of the delays [89] In February 2019, shortly after the season premiere, the series was renewed for a third season with writer Michelle Paradise promoted to co-showrunner alongside Kurtzman [90] In October 2019, Kurtzman said the third season would consist of 13 episodes [91] Active development on a fourth season had begun by January 2020, [92] and it was officially announced in October [93] Also in October, Kurtzman was asked how long he intended for Discovery to continue, especially with other streaming series being cancelled during the COVID-19 pandemic, and said there were \"years and years left on Discovery\" He noted the precedent of several previous Star Trek series running for seven seasons each [94] A 10-episode fifth season was ordered in January 2022 [95] [96] Paramount announced in March 2023 that the season would be the last for the series, [97] which came as a surprise to the cast and crew who expected to make at least one or two more seasons [98] The decision came amid cost cutting for Paramount's streaming content [99] The season's ending was updated so it could better serve as a series finale [100] [101]\n\n\nWriting\n\"The defining factor of Roddenberry's vision is the optimistic view of the future.. Once you lose that, you lose the essence of what Star Trek is  [The question] is how do you preserve and protect what Starfleet is in the weight of a challenge like war and the things that have to be done in war?\"\n\n\nCasting\nBy June 2016, Fuller had met with several actors and said the series would \"carry on what Star Trek does best\" by hiring a progressive, diverse cast, [66] with Kadin confirming that the series would feature minority, female, and LGBTQ characters [116] In August, Fuller said the series would star a lieutenant commander, to be played by a non-white actress, rather than a captain like previous Star Trek series He also said Discovery would include more alien characters than other Star Trek series, and would feature at least one openly gay character Fuller, who is gay himself, had been determined to see this happen since receiving hate mail while working on Voyager when a character on that show was rumored to be coming out as gay [1] Fuller discussed the series' casting with Mae Jemison, the first black woman in space who made a cameo appearance in an episode of The Next Generation [1] [117] He anticipated casting announcements in October, [67] but none had been made by the end of that month The majority of the series main characters were believed to have been cast by then, but no actress had been cast for the series' lead role This was a source of \"internal stress\" at CBS [71] Several African American and Latina actresses were being looked at for the role, with CBS preferring a \"fresh face\" over an established star [118] The cast was believed to include a female admiral, a male Klingon captain, a male admiral, a male adviser, and a British male doctor, with one of those male leads played by an openly gay actor [119]\n\n\nDesign\nFuller wanted to take advantage of modern effects, production design, and makeup to establish a new look for the series and franchise that previous Star Trek media was unable to achieve [1] Mark Worthington and Todd Cherniawsky served as initial production designers for the series, [129] and Suttirat Anne Larlarb was hired as costume designer [130] Glenn Hetrick and Neville Page of Alchemy Studios provided prosthetics and armor, [131] [132] with Page having previously designed for the rebooted Star Trek films [133] Mario Moreira served as prop master for the series, [134] with seven art directors, over nine illustrators, more than thirty-five set designers, and over four hundred and fifty painters, carpenters, sculptors, model makers, welders, set dressers, and prop builders all hired for the first season [135] The designers consulted with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for scientific accuracy [134] Tamara Deverell took over as production designer during production on the first season, [136] but left after the second [137] She was replaced by Phillip Barker, who was able to approach the third season as a fresh start due to the new time period Barker helped develop the new 32nd century technology as part of his design process [138] Doug McCullough took over as production designer for the fourth season [139]\n\n\nFilming\nStar Trek: Discovery is filmed at Pinewood Toronto Studios, [150] taking advantage of multiple soundstages at the studio including the largest one in North America [82] Filming for the series also takes place on location around Ontario, Canada, including at the Aga Khan Museum in Toronto to portray the Vulcan Science Academy, [151] the Hilton Falls and Kelso Conservation Areas, [152] the Scarborough Bluffs, [153] the Stelco steel plant in Hamilton, [138] and the disused Kingston Penitentiary [154] The series spent more than CA$257 million (US$202 million) in Ontario, and created more than 4,000 jobs for local crew, in just its first two seasons [155] Location filming for the series also took place outside of North America, with some filming in Jordan for the series premiere, [156] and in Iceland for the first two episodes of the third season [157]\n\n\nVisual effects\nVisual effects producers were hired to begin work on the series during the initial writing period, with Fuller explaining that they wanted to develop distinct looks for classic Star Trek effects such as digitally-augmented alien species and transporter beams [66] Pixomondo is the primary visual effects vendor for the series, [165] with other vendors including Spin VFX, [166] Ghost VFX, Mackevision, Crafty Apes, DNEG, The Mill, and FX3X, as well as visual effects supervisor Jason Zimmerman's in-house team at CBS Studios [167] Visual effects shots for each episode on Discovery typically take eight-to-ten months to complete, [112] and include fully digital environments such as the shuttle bay of Discovery, [102] [168] digital extensions of sets, [167] shots of the Discovery and other starships, [145] digital creatures, [169] holograms, [167] and 32nd century technology such as programmable matter [145] [146]\n\n\nMusic\nSeveral composers auditioned for the series, including Charles Henri Avelange, [170] and Fil Eisler whose audition music was used for the series' first teaser [116] Cliff Eidelman and Austin Wintory were also considered for the role, [171] [172] before Jeff Russo was announced as composer for the series in July 2017 [4] Russo wanted the show's main theme to embody the ideals of Star Trek and \"a commonality in people\" by only using chords that have a common note, with a melody then added over the top The theme is bookended by elements of the original Star Trek theme by Alexander Courage [173] Russo acknowledged that not all existing Star Trek fans were going to appreciate the new theme, but felt that regardless of how it compared to previous themes in the franchise it still accurately represented this series [174] Russo recorded the series' score with a 60-piece orchestra, [158] initially at the Eastwood Scoring Stage at Warner Bros Studios in California [175] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, musicians for the third season were recorded individually and their performances combined [176]\n\n\nRelease\nThe first episode of Star Trek: Discovery aired in a \"preview broadcast\" on CBS in the United States and was made available with the second episode on CBS All Access The rest of the series' episodes for the first three seasons were released weekly on All Access [79] CBS Studios International licensed the series to Bell Media for broadcast in Canada, and to Netflix for another 188 countries [61] In Canada, the premiere was simulcast with CBS on both the CTV Television Network and on the specialty channel CTV Sci-Fi Channel before being streamed on Crave; it was also broadcast in French on the specialty channel Z [61] Subsequent episodes were released through CTV Sci-Fi, Z, and Crave, [61] with CTV Sci-Fi airing each episode 30 minutes before it streamed on All Access [192] [193] In the other countries, Netflix released each episode of the first three seasons for streaming within 24 hours of its U.S debut [61] This agreement also saw Bell Media and Netflix acquire all previous Star Trek series to stream and broadcast at the time [61]\n\n\nReception\nAccording to Nielsen Media Research, the CBS broadcast of the first episode was watched by a \"decent\" audience of 9.5 million viewers [202] [203] The premiere of the series led to record subscriptions for CBS All Access, with the service having its biggest day of signups, as well as its biggest week and month of signups thanks to the series [204] According to \"app analytics

average in-app revenue during the previous 30 days [205] Increased subscribers for All Access was given as one of the reasons behind the series' second and third season renewals [84] [90] Audience demand analytics company Parrot Analytics estimates streaming viewership based on global \"demand expressions\", with the \"desire, engagement, and viewership weighted by importance\" In the company's

Discovery is a science fiction television series that premiered on September 24, 2017, on CBS All Access. The series is set in the Star Trek universe and takes place about a decade before the events of the original Star Trek series. The show follows the crew of the USS Discovery as they navigate through the galaxy, encountering various alien species and civilizations. The series is known for its complex characters, thought-provoking storylines, and stunning visuals.\n\n**Premise**\n\nThe series begins around ten years before the events of Star Trek: The Original Series, when Commander Michael Burnham's actions start a war between the United Federation of Planets and the Klingon Empire. She is court-martialed, stripped of rank, and reassigned to the USS Discovery, which has a unique means of propulsion called the \"Spore Drive.\" After an adventure in the Mirror Universe, Discovery helps end the Klingon war. In the second season, they investigate seven mysterious signals and a strange figure known as the \"Red Angel,\" and fight off a rogue artificial intelligence. This conflict ends with the Discovery traveling to the 32nd century, more than 900 years into their future.\n\n**Episodes**\n\nThe first episode of Star Trek: Discovery aired in a \"preview broadcast\" on CBS in the United States and was made available with the second episode on CBS All Access. The rest of the series' episodes for the first three seasons were released weekly on All Access. CBS Studios International licensed the series to Bell Media for broadcast in Canada, and to Netflix for another 188 countries. In Canada, the premiere was simulcast with CBS on both the CTV Television Network and on the specialty channel CTV Sci-Fi Channel before being streamed on Crave; it was also broadcast in French on the specialty channel Z. Subsequent episodes were released through CTV Sci-Fi, Z, and Crave, with CTV Sci-Fi airing each episode 30 minutes before it streamed on All Access. In the other countries, Netflix released each episode of the first three seasons for streaming within 24 hours of its U.S debut.\n\n**Cast and Characters**\n\nBy June 2016, Fuller had met with several actors and said the series would \"carry on what Star Trek does best\" by hiring a progressive, diverse cast, with Kadin confirming that the series would feature minority, female, and LGBTQ characters. In August, Fuller said the series would star a lieutenant commander, to be played by a non-white actress, rather than a captain like previous Star Trek series. He also said Discovery would include more alien characters than other Star Trek series, and would feature at least one openly gay character. Fuller, who is gay himself, had been determined to see this happen since receiving hate mail while working on Voyager when a character on that show was rumored to be coming out as gay.\n\n**Development**\n\nAfter beginning his career writing for the series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Star Trek: Voyager, Bryan Fuller was announced as the new series' showrunner and co-creator alongside Kurtzman in February 2016. Nicholas Meyer, writer and director of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982) and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991), also joined the series as a consulting producer. In March, Rod Roddenberry (the son of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry) and Trevor Roth of Roddenberry Entertainment also joined the series as executive producers. Fuller said working with people previously involved with Star Trek was \"really about making sure that we maintain authenticity,\" and said Meyer—who is widely considered to have made the best Star Trek film in The Wrath of Khan—brought \"a clarity and a cleanliness to the storytelling.\"\n\n**Writing**\n\n\"The defining factor of Roddenberry's vision is the optimistic view of the future. Once you lose that, you lose the essence of what Star Trek is. The question is how do you preserve and protect what Starfleet is in the weight of a challenge like war and the things that have to be done in war?\" Fuller wanted to take advantage of modern effects, production design, and makeup to establish a new look for the series and franchise that previous Star Trek media was unable to achieve. Mark Worthington and Todd Cherniawsky served as initial production designers for the series, and Suttirat Anne Larlarb was hired as costume designer.\n\n**Filming**\n\nStar Trek: Discovery is filmed at Pinewood Toronto Studios, taking advantage of multiple soundstages at the studio, including the largest one in North America. Filming for the series also takes place on location around Ontario, Canada, including at the Aga Khan Museum in Toronto to portray the Vulcan Science Academy, the Hilton Falls and Kelso Conservation Areas, the Scarborough Bluffs, the Stelco steel plant in Hamilton, and the disused Kingston Penitentiary. The series spent more than CA$257 million (US$202 million) in Ontario, and created more than 4,000 jobs for local crew, in just its first two seasons.\n\n**Visual Effects**\n\nVisual effects producers were hired to begin work on the series during the initial writing period, with Fuller explaining that they wanted to develop distinct looks for classic Star Trek effects such as digitally-augmented alien species and transporter beams. Pixomondo is the primary visual effects vendor for the series, with other vendors including Spin VFX, Ghost VFX, Mackevision, Crafty Apes, DNEG, The Mill, and FX3X, as well as visual effects supervisor Jason Zimmerman's in-house team at CBS Studios. Visual effects shots for each episode on Discovery typically take eight-to-ten months to complete, and include fully digital environments such as the shuttle bay of Discovery, digital extensions of sets, shots of the Discovery and other starships, digital creatures, holograms, and 32nd century technology such as programmable matter.\n\n**Music**\n\nSeveral composers auditioned for the series, including Charles Henri Avelange, and Fil Eisler whose audition music was used for the series' first teaser. Cliff Eidelman and Austin Wintory were also considered for the role, before Jeff Russo was announced as composer for the series in July 2017. Russo wanted the show's main theme to embody the ideals of Star Trek and \"a commonality in people\" by only using chords that have a common note, with a melody then added over the top. The theme is bookended by elements of the original Star Trek theme by Alexander Courage. Russo acknowledged that not all existing Star Trek fans were going to appreciate the new theme, but felt that regardless of how it compared to previous themes in the franchise it still accurately represented this series.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe first episode of Star Trek: Discovery aired in a \"preview broadcast\" on CBS in the United States and was made available with the second episode on CBS All Access. The rest of the series' episodes for the first three seasons were released weekly on All Access.

The game follows the story of six playable characters, each with their unique skills and abilities, as they navigate the city and try to survive the hordes of zombies. The game builds upon the success of its predecessor and offers a fresh take on the zombie genre.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nDead Island 2 is an action role-playing game played from a first-person perspective.

The game also features a variety of different types of zombies, each with its own unique behaviors and weaknesses.\n\nPlayers must choose from one of six playable characters as their player avatar, known as a Slayer. Each of the Slayers has their own unique skills and abilities, and players must choose from one of two defensive abilities: either learning to block hostile attacks or dodge them.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe game takes place about 15 years after the events of the first Dead Island.

The game's story is heavily focused on the character development and the relationships between the Slayers.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe development of Dead Island 2 was a long and complex process. The original developer, Techland, was set to develop the game, but they decided to work on Dying Light with Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment instead. Deep Silver went looking for a developer until Yager Development made a successful pitch to Deep Silver in Q3 2012.\n\nYager established a new division, Yager Productions GmbH, for development of the game. The game was originally scheduled for a Q2 2015 release, but it was delayed several times before its eventual release in 2023.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe game was shown at Gamescom 2022, and it was initially scheduled to release on February 3, 2023.

shredding of the picture during its auction has been suggested to be Banksy [155] [156] Banksy has since released a video on how the shredder was installed into the frame and the shredding of the

artwork, Banksy quoted Picasso: \"The urge to destroy is also a creative urge\" [157] [158] (Although Banksy cited Picasso, this quote is usually attributed to Mikhail Bakunin.)

In a 2003 interview with Simon Hattenstone of The Guardian, Banksy is described as \"white, 28, scruffy casual—jeans, T-shirt, a silver tooth, silver chain and silver earring. He looks like a cross between Jimmy Nail and Mike Skinner of The Streets.\" An ITV News segment of 2003 featured a short interview with someone identified in the reporting as Banksy. Banksy began as an artist at the age of 14, was expelled from school, and served time in prison for petty crime.

During this time he met Bristol photographer Steve Lazarides, who began selling Banksy's work, later becoming his agent. By 2000 he had turned to the art of stencilling after realising how much less time it took to complete a work. He claims he changed to stencilling while hiding from the police under a rubbish lorry, when he noticed the stencilled serial number and by employing this technique, he soon became more widely noticed for his art around Bristol and London. He was the goalkeeper for the Easton Cowboys and Cowgirls football team in the 1990s, and toured with the club to Mexico in 2001. Banksy's first known large wall mural was The Mild Mild West painted in 1997 to cover advertising of a former solicitors' office on Stokes Croft in Bristol. It depicts a teddy bear lobbing a Molotov cocktail at three riot police.\n\n**Early Career (1990–2001)**\n\nBanksy started as a freehand graffiti artist in 1990–1994 as one of Bristol's DryBreadZ Crew (DBZ), with two other artists known as Kato and Tes.

(2002) [42] [44]\n\n\n£10 notes to Barely Legal (2004–2006)\nIn August 2004, Banksy produced a quantity of spoof British £10 notes [48] replacing the picture of the Queen's head with Diana, Princess of Wales's head and changing the text \"Bank of England\" to \"Banksy of England\" Someone threw a large wad of these into a crowd at Notting Hill Carnival that year, which some recipients then tried to spend in local shops These notes were also given with invitations to a Santa's Ghetto exhibition by Pictures on Walls The individual notes have since been selling on eBay A wad of the notes was also thrown over a fence and into the crowd near the NME signing tent at the Reading Festival A limited run of 50 signed posters containing ten uncut notes was also produced and sold by Pictures on Walls for £100 each to commemorate the death of Princess Diana One of these sold in October 2007 at Bonhams auction house in London for £24,000 [49]\n\n\nBanksy effect (2006–2007)\nAfter Christina Aguilera bought an original of Queen Victoria as a lesbian and two prints for £25,000, [62] on 19 October 2006, a set of Kate Moss paintings sold in Sotheby's London for £50,400, setting an auction record for Banksy's work The six silk-screen prints, featuring the model painted in the style of Andy Warhol's Marilyn Monroe pictures, sold for five times their estimated price Their stencil of a green Mona Lisa with real paint dripping from her eyes sold for £57,600 at the same auction [63]\nIn December, journalist Max Foster coined the phrase, \"the Banksy effect\", to illustrate how interest in other street artists was growing on the back of Banksy's success [64]\n\n\n2008\nIn March, Nathan Wellard and Maev Neal, a couple from Norfolk, UK, made headlines in Britain when they decided to sell their mobile home that contains a 30-foot mural, entitled Fragile Silence, done by Banksy a decade prior to his rise to fame [79] According to Nathan Wellard, Banksy had asked the couple if he could use the side of their home as a \"large canvas\", to which they agreed In return for the \"canvas\", the Bristol stencil artist gave them two free tickets to the Glastonbury Festival The mobile home purchased by the couple 11 years earlier for £1,000, was priced at £500,000 [80]\n\n\nThe Cans Festival (2008)\nIn London, over the weekend 3–5 May 2008, Banksy hosted an exhibition called The Cans Festival It was situated on Leake Street, a road tunnel formerly used by Eurostar underneath London Waterloo station Graffiti artists with stencils were invited to join in and paint their own artwork, as long as it did not cover anyone else's [89] Banksy invited artists from around the world to exhibit their works [90]\n\n\n2009\nIn May 2009, Banksy parted company with agent Steve Lazarides and announced that Pest Control, [91] the handling service who act on his behalf, would be the only point of sale for new works.\nOn 13 June 2009, the Banksy vs Bristol Museum show opened at Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery, featuring more than 100 works of art, including animatronics and installations; it is his largest exhibition yet, featuring 78 new works [92] [93] Reaction to the show was positive, with over 8,500 visitors to the show on the first weekend [94] Over the course of the twelve weeks, the exhibition was visited over 300,000 times [95]\nIn September 2009, a Banksy work parodying the Royal Family was partially destroyed by Hackney Council after they served an enforcement notice for graffiti removal to the former address of the property owner The mural had been commissioned for the 2003 Blur single \"Crazy Beat\" and the property owner, who had allowed it to be painted, was reported to have been in tears when she saw it was being painted over [96]\n\n\nExit Through the Gift Shop and United States (2010)\nThe world premiere of the film Exit Through the Gift Shop occurred at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, on 24 January He created 10 street artworks around Park City and Salt Lake City to tie in with the screening [99] In February, The Whitehouse public house in Liverpool, England, was sold for £114,000 at auction The side of the building has an image of a giant rat by Banksy [100]\n\n\n2011–2013\nIn May 2011 Banksy released a lithographic print which showed a smoking petrol bomb contained in a 'Tesco Value' bottle This followed a long-running campaign by locals against the opening of a Tesco Express supermarket in Banksy's home city of Bristol Violent clashes had taken place between police and demonstrators in the Stokes Croft area Banksy produced the poster ostensibly to raise money for local groups in the Stokes Croft area and to raise money for the legal defence of those arrested during the riots The posters were sold exclusively at the Bristol Anarchists Bookfair in Stokes Croft for £5 each In December, he unveiled Cardinal Sin at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool The bust, which replaces a priest's face with a pixelated effect, was a statement on the child abuse scandal in the Catholic Church [116]\n\n\nBetter Out Than In (2013)\nOn 1 October 2013, Banksy began a one-month \"show on the streets of New York  [City]\", for which he opened a separate website [126] and granted an interview to The Village Voice via his publicist [127]\n\n\n2015–2018\nIn February 2015 Banksy published a 2-minute video titled Make this the year YOU discover a new destination about his trip to the Gaza Strip During the visit, he painted a few artworks including a kitten on the remains of a house destroyed by an Israeli air strike (\"I wanted to highlight the destruction in Gaza by posting photos on my website—but on the internet people only look at pictures of kittens\") and a swing hanging off a watchtower In a statement to The New York Times his publicist said,\n\n\nLove is in the Bin (2018)\nIn October 2018, a Banksy work, initially titled the Balloon Girl, was sold for £1m at London auction house Sotheby's The purchaser of the work was an unnamed European woman As the gavel hit the sound-block, an alarm sounded within the picture frame and the Banksy canvas passed through a shredder hidden within the frame, partially shredding the picture [149] [150] Banksy then posted an image of the shredding on Instagram captioned \"Going, going, gone...\" [151] After the sale, the auction house acknowledged that the self-destruction of the work was a prank by the artist [152] The prank received wide news coverage around the world, with one newspaper stating that it was \"quite possibly the biggest prank in art history\" [150] Joey Syer, co-founder of an online platform facilitating art dealer sales, [153] told the Evening Standard: \"The auction result will only propel this further and given the media attention this stunt has received, the lucky buyer would see a great return on the £1m they paid last night, this is now part of art history in its shredded state and we'd estimate Banksy has added a minimum of 50% to its value, possibly as high as being worth £2m+.\" [154] A man seen filming the shredding of the picture during its auction has been suggested to be Banksy [155] [156] Banksy has since released a video on how the shredder was installed into the frame and the shredding of the picture, explaining that he had surreptitiously fitted the painting with the shredder a few years previously, in case it ever went up for auction To explain his rationale for destroying his own artwork, Banksy quoted Picasso: \"The urge to destroy is also a creative urge\" [157] [158] (Although Banksy cited Picasso, this quote is usually attributed to Mikhail Bakunin.) [159] It is not known how the shredder was activated [160] Banksy has released another video indicating that the painting was intended to be shredded completely The video shows a sample painting completely shredded by the frame and says: \"In rehearsals it worked every time...\" [161]\n\n\n2018–2019\nA two-sided graffiti piece, one side depicting a child tasting the falling snow, the other revealing that the snow is in fact smoke and embers from a dumpster fire, appeared on two walls of a steelworker's garage in Port Talbot in December [165] [166] Banksy then revealed that the painting was in fact his via an Instagram video soundtracked by the festive children's song \"Little Snowflake\" [167] Many fans of the artist went to see the painting and Plaid Cymru councillor for Aberavon, Nigel Thomas Hunt, stated that the town was \"buzzing\" with speculation that the work was Banksy's The owner of the garage, Ian Lewis, said that he had lost sleep over fears that the image would be vandalised [168] A plastic screen, partially funded by Michael Sheen, was installed to protect the mural, but was attacked by a \"drunk halfwit\" [169] Extra security guards were subsequently drafted to protect the graffiti piece [170] In May 2019, the mural was moved to a gallery in the town's Ty'r Orsaf building [171]\n\n\n2020s\nOn 13 February 2020, the Valentine's Banksy mural appeared on the side of a building in Bristol's Barton Hill neighbourhood, depicting a young girl firing a slingshot of real red flowers and leaves [178] In the early hours of Valentine's Day (14 February), Banksy confirmed this was his work on his Instagram account and website [179] The painting was defaced just days after appearing [180] Banksy dedicated a painting titled Painting for Saints or Game Changer to NHS staff, and donated it to the University Hospital of Southampton during the global coronavirus pandemic in May 2020 [181] The painting was sold for £14.4m (£16.8m including buyer premium) on 23 March 2021, which is a record for an artwork by Banksy The proceeds from the sale would benefit a number of NHS-related organisations and charities [182]\n\n\nOther artworks\nBanksy has claimed responsibility for a number of high-profile artworks, including the following:\n\n\nDamaged artwork\nMany artworks by Banksy have been vandalised, painted over or destroyed.\n\n\nTechnique\nBecause of the secretive nature of Banksy's work and identity, it is uncertain what techniques he uses to generate the images in the stencils, though it is assumed he uses computers for some images due to the photographic quality of much of his work He mentions in his book Wall and Piece that as he was starting to do graffiti, he was always either caught or could never finish the art in one sitting He claims he changed to stencilling while hiding from the police under a rubbish lorry, when he noticed the stencilled serial number He then devised a series of intricate stencils for minimising time and overlapping of the colour.\n\n\nPolitical and social themes\nBanksy once characterised graffiti as a form of underclass \"revenge\", or guerrilla warfare that allows an individual to snatch away power, territory and glory from a bigger and better equipped enemy [56] Banksy sees a social class component to this struggle, remarking \"If you don't own a train company then you go and paint on one instead.\" [56] Banksy's work has also shown a desire to mock centralised power, hoping that their work will show the public that although power does exist and works against you, that power is not terribly efficient and it can and should be deceived [56]\n\n\nPhilanthropy and activism\nBanksy has donated a number of works to promote various causes, such as Civilian Drone Strike, which was sold in 2017 at £205,000 to raise funds for Campaign Against Arms Trade and Reprieve It was part of the exhibition \"Art the Arms Fair\" set up in opposition to the DSEI arms fair [255] In 2018, a sculpture titled Dream Boat, which was exhibited in Dismaland in 2015, was raffled off in aid of the NGO Help Refugees (now called Choose Love) for a minimum donation of £2 for every guesses of its weight in a pop-up Choose Love shop in Carnaby Street [256] In 2002, he produced artwork for the Greenpeace campaign Save or Delete He also provided works to support local causes; in 2013, a work titled The Banality of the Banality of Evil was sold for an undisclosed amount after a failed auction to support an anti-homelessness charity in New York [257] In 2014, an artwork on a doorway titled Mobile Lovers was sold £403,000 to keep a youth club in Bristol open, [258] [259] and he created merchandise for homeless charities in Bristol in 2019 [260]\n\n\nBooks\nBanksy has published several books that contain photographs of his work accompanied by his own writings:\n\n\nSee also\nOfficial websites:\n\n\nReferences\nOfficial websites:\n\n\nFurther reading\nOfficial websites:\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial websites:\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

[23]\n\n\nWriting\nThe third season begins just over a year after the second [24] It tells a new story, despite the two seasons being developed together, [25] and Matalas said the third season was \"incredibly different\" from the first two [26] He hoped it would be a satisfying conclusion for Picard's story, [26] and said it would be less intimate and have some \"game-changing Star Trek Universe ideas\" Matalas added that some elements from Star Trek: The Original Series and the films starring the Original Series cast would be used in the season to \"tie some Star Trek together\", [27] including the Spacedock and boatswain's whistle from those films [28] The season also has references to the films' \"more nautical, cat and mouse submarine-movie\" ideas [26] Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982) was a \"major touchstone\" for the season, which features mind games between Picard and a new villain [29]\n\n\nCasting\nWhen originally developing the series, the creative team discussed not bringing back any other characters from The Next Generation to allow Picard to stand alone and not become reliant on nostalgia Part of this was to allow newcomers who had not seen the previous series to enjoy Picard However, the writers wanted to be respectful to longtime fans of Star Trek and felt they were missing opportunities by not including certain characters, so they decided to add some returning guests who organically served the new story [35] In January 2020, Stewart said it was his hope that all of the main cast of The Next Generation would appear on Picard before the end of the series [36]\n\n\nDesign\nMatalas said each season of Picard would be differentiated visually, but he and production designer Dave Blass wanted the second and third seasons to return to the visual style of the Next Generation era [26] In April 2022, Blass announced that several crew members from Next Generation era Star Trek had returned to work on the design team for Picard: computer graphics engineer Ben Betts, visual effects producer Dan Curry, set designer Daren Dochterman, concept designer and visual effects artist Doug Drexler, starship designer John Eaves, graphic designer Monica Fedrick, graphic designer Alan Kobayashi, production designer Geoffrey Mandel, video engineer Larry Markart, computer playback supervisor Todd A Marks, production illustrator Jim Martin, art director Karl J Martin, and graphic designer Michael Okuda who designed the LCARS computer system for The Next Generation [48]\n\n\nFilming\nFilming for the second season began on February 16, 2021, [57] with some third-season scenes being filmed at the same time [58] Production was taking place in California where the series received tax incentives to continue filming there after the first season [59] The second and third seasons had one of the largest television series crews at the time with more than 450 crewmembers [60] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, strict guidelines were followed on set and cast and crew members were regularly tested [58] Principal photography for the second season ended on September 2, and the production then segued fully into filming the third [22]\n\n\nVisual effects\nThe user interfaces for the starships were created by visual effects company Twisted Media, based on the LCARS computer system They referenced the designs from The Next Generation and the films of that era, as well as the Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual (1991) reference guide by Rick Sternbach and Michael Okuda Okuda consulted on the company's LCARS designs, as did Drexler who also provided digital models that were integrated into the interface screens [68] For two episodes in the second season, Todd A Marks and his video playback company Images on Screen used a combination of LG OLED screens and Screen Innovations' FlexGlass projection screens (paired with rear screen projectors) to display the user interfaces on set during filming The success of the FlexGlass projection technology led to it being used much more in the third season [69]\n\n\nMusic\nStephen Barton, returning to work with Matalas from the series 12 Monkeys, replaced composer Jeff Russo from the first two seasons [70] Barton and Matalas began work on the season's score by April 2022, [71] composing new themes together including the theme for the USS Titan-A [72] Frederik Wiedmann provided additional music for the season, which Matalas said was necessary due to the scope of the score for the later episodes [34]\n\n\nMarketing\nUnusually for a television showrunner, Matalas was able to collaborate with the Paramount+ marketing department and editor Drew Nichols on the trailers for the season so he would be happy about how much information was released early [78] A teaser was released on April 5, 2022, celebrating \"First Contact Day\" which marks the fictional holiday when first contact between humans and aliens was made in the Star Trek universe The teaser included the announcement of the returning Next Generation cast members with voiceover from those actors and footage of Picard looking at an old uniform [1] Another teaser was released during the Star Trek Universe panel at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2022, giving a first look at the returning Next Generation cast members in costume [29] Character posters for Stewart, Ryan, Hurd, and the returning Next Generation actors were also released [79]\n\n\nRelease\nThe season premiered on Paramount+ in the United States on February 16, 2023, and ran for 10 episodes until April 20 [51] Matalas said in

seven hours of special features [93] Both releases included an older version of a visual effects shot from the finale, featuring the Enterprise-D flying towards Earth, which had been updated on Paramount+ soon after the episode was released to use an \"enhanced\" version created for the finale's theatrical screenings After fans and journalists pointed this out, Paramount said the updated

Stewart officially announced the third season in September 2021, [18] shortly after filming had begun [22] In February 2022, Goldsman confirmed that the third season would be the last for the series [23]\n\n\nWriting\nThe third season begins just over a year after the second [24] It tells a new story, despite the two seasons being developed together, [25] and Matalas said the third season was \"incredibly different\" from the first two [26] He hoped it would be a satisfying conclusion for Picard's story, [26] and said it would be less intimate and have some \"game-changing Star Trek Universe ideas\" Matalas added that some elements from Star Trek: The Original Series and the films starring the Original Series cast would be used in the season to \"tie some Star Trek together\", [27] including the Spacedock and boatswain's whistle from those films [28] The season also has references to the films' \"more nautical, cat and mouse submarine-movie\" ideas [26] Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982) was a \"major touchstone\" for the season, which features mind games between Picard and a new villain [29]\n\n\nCasting\nWhen originally developing the series, the creative team discussed not bringing back any other characters from The Next Generation to allow Picard to stand alone and not become reliant on nostalgia Part of this was to allow newcomers who had not seen the previous series to enjoy Picard However, the writers wanted to be respectful to longtime fans of Star Trek and felt they were missing opportunities by not including certain characters, so they decided to add some returning guests who organically served the new story [35] In January 2020, Stewart said it was his hope that all of the main cast of The Next Generation would appear on Picard before the end of the series [36]\n\n\nDesign\nMatalas said each season of Picard would be differentiated visually, but he and production designer Dave Blass wanted the second and third seasons to return to the visual style of the Next Generation era [26] In April 2022, Blass announced that several crew members from Next Generation era Star Trek had returned to work on the design team for Picard: computer graphics engineer Ben Betts, visual effects producer Dan Curry, set designer Daren Dochterman, concept designer and visual effects artist Doug Drexler, starship designer John Eaves, graphic designer Monica Fedrick, graphic designer Alan Kobayashi, production designer Geoffrey Mandel, video engineer Larry Markart, computer playback supervisor Todd A Marks, production illustrator Jim Martin, art director Karl J Martin, and graphic designer Michael Okuda who designed the LCARS computer system for The Next Generation [48]\n\n\nFilming\nFilming for the second season began on February 16, 2021, [57] with some third-season scenes being filmed at the same time [58] Production was taking place in California where the series received tax incentives to continue filming there after the first season [59] The second and third seasons had one of the largest television series crews at the time with more than 450 crewmembers [60] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, strict guidelines were followed on set and cast and crew members were regularly tested [58] Principal photography for the second season ended on September 2, and the production then segued fully into filming the third [22]\n\n\nVisual effects\nThe user interfaces for the starships were created by visual effects company Twisted Media, based on the LCARS computer system They referenced the designs from The Next Generation and the films of that era, as well as the Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual (1991) reference guide by Rick Sternbach and Michael Okuda Okuda consulted on the company's LCARS designs, as did Drexler who also provided digital models that were integrated into the interface screens [68] For two episodes in the second season, Todd A Marks and his video playback company Images on Screen used a combination of LG OLED screens and Screen Innovations' FlexGlass projection screens (paired with rear screen projectors) to display the user interfaces on set during filming The success of the FlexGlass projection technology led to it being used much more in the third season [69]\n\n\nMusic\nStephen Barton, returning to work with Matalas from the series 12 Monkeys, replaced composer Jeff Russo from the first two seasons [70] Barton and Matalas began work on the season's score by April 2022, [71] composing new themes together including the theme for the USS Titan-A [72] Frederik Wiedmann provided additional music for the season, which Matalas said was necessary due to the scope of the score for the later episodes [34]\n\n\nMarketing\nUnusually for a television showrunner, Matalas was able to collaborate with the Paramount+ marketing department and editor Drew Nichols on the trailers for the season so he would be happy about how much information was released early [78] A teaser was released on April 5, 2022, celebrating \"First Contact Day\" which marks the fictional holiday when first contact between humans and aliens was made in the Star Trek universe The teaser included the announcement of the returning Next Generation cast members with voiceover from those actors and footage of Picard looking at an old uniform [1] Another teaser was released during the Star Trek Universe panel at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2022, giving a first look at the returning Next Generation cast members in costume [29] Character posters for Stewart, Ryan, Hurd, and the returning Next Generation actors were also released [79]\n\n\nRelease\nThe season premiered on Paramount+ in the United States on February 16, 2023, and ran for 10 episodes until April 20 [51] Matalas said in August 2022 that the season would be ready for release later that year and he tried to move the premiere to Christmas 2022, but Paramount+ wanted to release it in 2023 [32] [87] Each episode of Picard was broadcast in Canada by Bell Media on the same day as the Paramount+ release, on the specialty channels CTV Sci-Fi Channel (English) and Z (French) before streaming on Crave [88] Amazon Prime Video released each episode within 24 hours of its U.S debut in over 200 other countries and territories around the world [89]\n\n\nStreaming and broadcast\nThe season premiered on Paramount+ in the United

behind-the-scenes featurettes on the Next Generation cast, reconstructing the Enterprise-D set, and Vadic [93] [94] Also released on September 5 was a box set featuring the complete series and over seven hours of special features [93] Both releases included an older version of a visual effects shot from the finale, featuring the Enterprise-D flying towards Earth, which had been updated on Paramount+ soon after the episode was released to use an \"enhanced\" version created for the finale's theatrical screenings After fans and journalists pointed this out, Paramount said the updated version of the effects shot would be used for future home media releases instead [95] [96] A 54-disc Blu-ray \"Picard Legacy Collection\" that includes this series was released on November 7 [93]\n\n\nReception\nEric Deggans of NPR included the season on his list of most anticipated series of early 2023, [97] and staff at Collider included it on their list of most anticipated series of

and Gates McFadden were named TVLine's \"Performers of the Week\" for the week of February 26, 2023, for their performances in the episode \"Seventeen Seconds\" The site focused on the scene in which Picard confronts Crusher about their son, saying Stewart \"did some of his best work ever as Jean-Luc in those moments, and McFadden matched him beat for emotional beat.. plumbing depths that Trek shows rarely attempt to reach\" [104] The site also named Amanda Plummer and Michelle Forbes as honorable mentions for their performances in \"Disengage\" and \"Imposters\", respectively They said Plummer was \"deliciously evil as Vadic\" and the first memorable villain of the modern Star Trek series, while Forbes was a \"jaw-dropping blast from the past\" who let the audience see \"the decades of pain buried deep inside Ro\" in her scenes with Stewart [105] [106]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

his mother, Maria Panteleyevna Gorbacheva (née Gopkalo), was colder and punitive [8] His parents were poor, [9] and lived as peasants [10] They had married as teenagers in 1928, [11] and in keeping with local tradition had initially resided in Sergey's father's house, an adobe-walled hut, before a hut of their own could be built [12]\n\n\n1931–1950: childhood\nGorbachev was born on 2 March 1931 in the village of Privolnoye, then in the North Caucasus Krai of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Soviet Union [4] At the time, Privolnoye was divided almost evenly between ethnic Russians and ethnic Ukrainians [5] Gorbachev's paternal family were ethnic Russians and had moved to the region from Voronezh several generations before;

he established a discussion circle in Gorkaya Balka village to help its peasant residents gain social contacts [60]\n\n\n1955–1969: Stavropol Komsomol\nIn August 1955, Gorbachev started work at the Stavropol regional procurator's office, but disliked the job and used his contacts to get a transfer to work for Komsomol, [58] becoming deputy director of Komsomol's agitation and propaganda department for that region [59] In this position, he visited villages in the area and tried to improve the lives of their inhabitants; he established a discussion circle in Gorkaya Balka village to help its peasant residents gain social contacts [60]\n\n\n1970–1977: heading the Stavropol region\nIn April 1970, Yefremov was promoted to a higher position in Moscow and Gorbachev succeeded him as the First Secretary of the Stavropol kraikom This granted Gorbachev significant power over the Stavropol region [95] He had been personally vetted for the position by senior Kremlin leaders and was informed of their decision by the Soviet leader, Leonid Brezhnev [96] Aged 39, he was considerably younger than his predecessors in the position [97] As head of the Stavropol region, he automatically became a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (24th term) in 1971 [98] According to biographer Zhores Medvedev, Gorbachev \"had now joined the Party's super-elite\" [99] As regional leader, Gorbachev initially attributed economic and other failures to \"the inefficiency and incompetence of cadres, flaws in management structure or gaps in legislation\", but eventually concluded that they were caused by an excessive centralization of decision making in Moscow [100] He began reading translations of restricted texts by Western Marxist authors such as Antonio Gramsci, Louis Aragon, Roger Garaudy, and Giuseppe Boffa, and came under their influence [100]\n\n\nSecretary of the Central Committee of CPSU\nIn November 1978, Gorbachev was appointed a Secretary of the Central Committee [119] His appointment had been approved unanimously by the Central Committee's members [120] To fill this position, Gorbachev and his wife moved to Moscow, where they were initially given an old dacha outside the city They then moved to another, at Sosnovka, before finally being allocated a newly built brick house [121] He was also given an apartment inside the city, but gave that to his daughter and son-in-law; Irina had begun work at Moscow's Second Medical Institute [122] As part of the Moscow political elite, Gorbachev and his wife now had access to better medical care and to specialized shops; they were also given cooks, servants, bodyguards, and secretaries, although many of these were spies for the KGB [123] In his new position, Gorbachev often worked twelve to sixteen hour days [123] He and his wife socialized little, but liked to visit Moscow's theaters and museums [124]\n\n\nLeader of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)\nOn 10 March 1985, Chernenko died [153] Gromyko proposed Gorbachev as the next general secretary; as a longstanding party member, Gromyko's recommendation carried great weight among the Central Committee [154] Gorbachev expected much opposition to his nomination as general secretary, but ultimately the rest of the Politburo supported him [155] Shortly after Chernenko's death, the Politburo unanimously elected Gorbachev as his successor; they wanted him rather than another elderly leader [156] He thus became the eighth leader of the Soviet Union [10] Few in the government imagined that he would be as radical a reformer as he proved [157] Although he was not a well-known figure to the Soviet public, there was widespread relief that the new leader was not elderly and ailing [158] Gorbachev's first public appearance as leader was at Chernenko's Red Square funeral, held on 14 March [159] Two months after being elected, he left Moscow for the first time, traveling to Leningrad, where he spoke to assembled crowds [160] In June he traveled to Ukraine, in July to Belarus, and in September to Tyumen Oblast, urging party members in these areas to take more responsibility for fixing local problems [161]\n\n\n1985–1986: early years\nGorbachev's leadership style differed from that of his predecessors He would stop to talk to civilians on the street, forbade the display of his portrait at the 1985 Red Square holiday celebrations, and encouraged frank and open discussions at Politburo meetings [162] To the West, Gorbachev was seen as a more moderate and less threatening Soviet leader; some Western commentators however believed this an act to lull Western governments into a false sense of security [163] His wife was his closest adviser, and took on the unofficial role of a \"first lady\" by appearing with him on foreign trips; her public visibility was a breach of standard practice and generated resentment [164] His other close aides were Georgy Shakhnazarov and Anatoly Chernyaev [165]\n\n\nDomestic policies\nGorbachev recurrently employed the term perestroika, first used publicly in March 1984 [174] He saw perestroika as encompassing a complex series of reforms to restructure society and the economy [175] He was concerned by the country's low productivity, poor work ethic, and inferior quality goods; [176] like several economists, he feared this would lead to the country becoming a second-rate power [177] The first stage of Gorbachev's perestroika was uskoreniye (\"acceleration\"), a term he used regularly in the first two years of his leadership [178] The Soviet Union was behind the United States in many areas of production, [179] but Gorbachev claimed that it would accelerate industrial output to match that of the US by 2000 [180] The Five Year Plan of 1985–1990 was targeted to expand machine building by 50 to 100% [181] To boost agricultural productivity, he merged five ministries and a state committee into a single entity, Agroprom, although by late 1986 he acknowledged this merger as a failure [182]\n\n\nForeign policy\nIn a May 1985 speech given to the Soviet Foreign Ministry—the first time a Soviet leader had directly addressed his country's diplomats—Gorbachev spoke of a \"radical restructuring\" of foreign policy [221] A major issue facing his leadership was Soviet involvement in the Afghan Civil War, which had then been going on for over five years [222] Over the course of the war, the Soviet Army took heavy casualties and there was much opposition to Soviet involvement among both the public and military [222] On becoming leader, Gorbachev saw withdrawal from the war as a key priority [223] In October 1985, he met with Afghan Marxist leader Babrak Karmal, urging him to acknowledge the lack of widespread public support for his government and pursue a power sharing agreement with the opposition [223] That month, the Politburo approved Gorbachev's decision to withdraw combat troops from Afghanistan, although the last troops did not leave until February 1989 [224]\n\n\n1987–1989: further reforms\nIn January 1987, Gorbachev attended a Central Committee plenum where he talked about perestroika and democratization while criticizing widespread corruption [242] He considered putting a proposal to allow multi-party elections into his speech, but decided against doing so [243] After the plenum, he focused his attentions on economic reform, holding discussions with government officials and economists [244] Many economists proposed reducing ministerial controls on the economy and allowing state-owned enterprises to set their own targets; Ryzhkov and other government figures were skeptical [245] In June, Gorbachev finished his report on economic reform It reflected a compromise: ministers would retain the ability to set output targets but these would not be considered binding [246] That month, a plenum accepted his recommendations and the Supreme Soviet passed a \"law on enterprises\" implementing the changes [247] Economic problems remained: by the late 1980s there were still widespread shortages of basic goods, rising inflation, and declining living standards [248] These stoked a number of miners' strikes in 1989 [249]\n\n\nDomestic reforms\nIn January 1987, Gorbachev attended a Central Committee plenum where he talked about perestroika and democratization while criticizing widespread corruption [242] He considered putting a proposal to allow multi-party elections into his speech, but decided against doing so [243] After the plenum, he focused his attentions on economic reform, holding discussions with government officials and economists [244] Many economists proposed reducing ministerial controls on the economy and allowing state-owned enterprises to set their own targets; Ryzhkov and other government figures were skeptical [245] In June, Gorbachev finished his report on economic reform It reflected a compromise: ministers would retain the ability to set output targets but these would not be considered binding [246] That month, a plenum accepted his recommendations and the Supreme Soviet passed a \"law on enterprises\" implementing the changes [247] Economic problems remained: by the late 1980s there were still widespread shortages of basic goods, rising inflation, and declining living standards [248] These stoked a number of miners' strikes in 1989 [249]\n\n\nForming the Congress of People's Deputies\nAlthough the next party congress was not scheduled until 1991, Gorbachev convened the 19th Party Conference in its place in June 1988 He hoped that by allowing a broader range of people to attend than at previous conferences, he would gain additional support for his reforms [269] With sympathetic officials and academics, Gorbachev drafted plans for reforms that would shift power away from the Politburo and towards the soviets While the soviets had become largely powerless bodies that rubber-stamped Politburo policies, he wanted them to become year-round legislatures He proposed the formation of a new institution, the Congress of People's Deputies, whose members were to be elected in a largely free vote [270] This congress would in turn elect a USSR Supreme Soviet, which would do most of the legislating [271]\n\n\nRelations with China and Western states\nGorbachev tried to improve relations with the UK, France, and West Germany; [285] like previous Soviet leaders, he was interested in pulling Western Europe away from US influence [286] Calling for greater pan-European co-operation, he publicly spoke of a \"Common European Home\" and of a Europe \"from the Atlantic to the Urals\" [287] In March 1987, Thatcher visited Gorbachev in Moscow; despite their ideological differences, they liked one another [288] In April 1989 he visited London, lunching with Elizabeth II [289] In May 1987, Gorbachev again visited France, and in November 1988 Mitterrand visited him in Moscow [290] The West German chancellor, Helmut Kohl, had initially offended Gorbachev by comparing him to Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels, although he later informally apologized and in October 1988 visited Moscow [291] In June 1989 Gorbachev then visited Kohl in West Germany [292] In November 1989 he also visited Italy, meeting with Pope John Paul II [293] Gorbachev's relationships with these West European leaders were typically far warmer than those he had with their Eastern Bloc counterparts [294]\n\n\nNationality question and the Eastern Bloc\nOn taking power, Gorbachev found some unrest among different national groups within the Soviet Union In December 1986, riots broke out in several Kazakh cities after a Russian was appointed head of the region [316] In 1987, Crimean Tatars protested in Moscow to demand resettlement in Crimea, the area from which they had been deported on Stalin's orders in 1944 Gorbachev ordered a commission, headed by Gromyko, to examine their situation Gromyko's report opposed calls for assisting Tatar resettlement in Crimea [317] By 1988, the Soviet \"nationality question\" was increasingly pressing [318] In February, the administration of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast officially requested that it be transferred from the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic to the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic; the majority of the region's population were ethnically Armenian and wanted unification with other majority Armenian areas [319] As rival Armenian and Azerbaijani demonstrations took place in Nagorno-Karabakh, Gorbachev called an emergency meeting of the Politburo [320] Gorbachev promised greater autonomy for Nagorno-Karabakh but refused the transfer, fearing that it would set off similar ethnic tensions and demands throughout the Soviet Union [321] In the end however, greater autonomy was never given, and instead Gorbachev ordered the further violent ethnic cleansing of Armenians in parts of Nagorno-Karabakh and the adjacent Armenian-populated Shahumyan region, in what was named Operation Ring [322]\n\n\nUnraveling of the USSR\nIn the Revolutions of 1989, most of the Marxist–Leninist states of Central and Eastern Europe held multi-party elections resulting in regime change [341] In most countries, like Poland and Hungary, this was achieved peacefully, but in Romania, the revolution turned violent, and led to Ceaușescu's overthrow and execution [341] Gorbachev was too preoccupied with domestic problems to pay much attention to these events [342] He believed that democratic elections would not lead Eastern European countries into abandoning their commitment to socialism [343] In 1989, he visited East Germany for the fortieth anniversary of its founding; [344] shortly after, in November, the East German government allowed its citizens to cross the Berlin Wall, a decision Gorbachev praised Over the following years, much of the wall was demolished [345] Neither Gorbachev nor Thatcher or Mitterrand wanted a swift reunification of Germany, aware that it would likely become the dominant European power Gorbachev wanted a gradual process of German integration but Kohl began calling for rapid reunification [346] With German reunification in 1990, many observers declared the Cold War over [347]\n\n\n1990–1991: presidency of the Soviet Union\nIn February 1990, both liberalisers and Marxist–Leninist hardliners intensified their attacks on Gorbachev [348] A liberalizer march took place in Moscow criticizing Communist Party rule, [349] while at a Central Committee meeting, the hardliner Vladimir Brovikov accused Gorbachev of reducing the country to \"anarchy\" and \"ruin\" and of pursuing Western approval at the expense of the Soviet Union and the Marxist–Leninist cause [350] Gorbachev was aware that the Central Committee could still oust him as general secretary, and so decided to reformulate the role of head of government to a presidency from which he could not be removed [351] He decided that the presidential election should be held by the Congress of People's Deputies He chose this over a public vote because he thought the latter would escalate tensions and feared that he might lose it; [352] a spring 1990 poll nevertheless still showed him as the most popular politician in the country [353]\n\n\nGerman reunification and the Gulf War\nIn January 1990, Gorbachev privately agreed to permit East German reunification with West Germany, but rejected the idea that a unified Germany could retain West Germany's NATO membership [362] His compromise that Germany might retain both NATO and Warsaw Pact memberships did not attract support [363] On 9 February 1990 in a phone conversation with James Baker, then the US secretary of state, he set out his position that \"a broadening of the NATO zone is not acceptable\" to which Baker agreed Scholars are puzzled why Gorbachev never pursued a written pledge [364] In May 1990, he visited the US for talks with President Bush; [365] there, he agreed that an independent Germany would have the right to choose its international alliances [363] Ultimately he acquiesced to the reunification on the condition that NATO troops not be posted to the territory of Eastern Germany [366] There remains some confusion over whether US secretary of state James Baker led Gorbachev to believe that NATO would not expand into other countries in Eastern Europe as well There was no oral or written US promise that explicitly said so Gorbachev himself has stated that he was only made such a promise regarding East Germany and that it was kept [367] [368] In July, Kohl visited Moscow and Gorbachev informed him that the Soviets would not oppose a reunified Germany being part of NATO [369] Domestically, Gorbachev's critics accused him of betraying the national interest; [370] more broadly, they were angry that Gorbachev had allowed the Eastern Bloc to move away from direct Soviet influence [371]\n\n\nAugust coup and government crises\nAt the 28th Communist Party Congress in July 1990, hardliners criticized the reformists, but Gorbachev was re-elected party leader with the support of three-quarters of delegates, and his choice of deputy general secretary, Vladimir Ivashko, was also elected [388] Seeking compromise with the liberalizers, Gorbachev assembled a team of both his own and Yeltsin's advisers to come up with an economic reform package: the result was the \"500 Days\" programme This called for further decentralization and some privatization [389] Gorbachev described the plan as \"modern socialism\" rather than a return to capitalism but had many doubts about it [390] In September, Yeltsin presented the plan to the Russian Supreme Soviet, which backed it [391] Many in the Communist Party and state apparatus warned against it, arguing that it would create marketplace chaos, rampant inflation, and unprecedented levels of unemployment [392] The 500 Days plan was abandoned [393] At this, Yeltsin railed against Gorbachev in an October speech, claiming that Russia would no longer accept a subordinate position to the Soviet government [394]\n\n\nFinal days and collapse\nAfter the coup, the Supreme Soviet indefinitely suspended all Communist Party activity, effectively ending communist rule in the Soviet Union [426] [427] From then on, the country collapsed with dramatic speed.\n\n\nPost-USSR life\nOut of office, Gorbachev had more time to spend with his wife and family [450] He and Raisa initially lived in their dilapidated dacha on Rublevskoe Shosse, and were also allowed to privatize their smaller apartment on Kosygin Street [450] He focused on establishing his International Foundation for Socio-Economic and Political Studies, or \"Gorbachev Foundation\", launched in March 1992; [451] Yakovlev and Revenko were its first vice presidents [452] Its initial tasks were in analyzing and publishing material on the history of perestroika, as well as defending the policy from what it called \"slander and falsifications\" The foundation also tasked itself with monitoring and critiquing life in post-Soviet Russia, presenting alternative development forms to those pursued by Yeltsin [452]\n\n\n1991–1999: initial years\nOut of office, Gorbachev had more time to spend with his wife and family [450] He and Raisa initially lived in their dilapidated dacha on Rublevskoe Shosse, and were also allowed to privatize their smaller apartment on Kosygin Street [450] He focused on establishing his International Foundation for Socio-Economic and Political Studies, or \"Gorbachev Foundation\", launched in March 1992; [451] Yakovlev and Revenko were its first vice presidents [452] Its initial tasks were in analyzing and publishing material on the history of perestroika, as well as defending the policy from what it called \"slander and falsifications\" The foundation also tasked itself with monitoring and critiquing life in post-Soviet Russia, presenting alternative development forms to those pursued by Yeltsin [452]\n\n\n1996 presidential campaign\nThe Russian presidential elections were scheduled for June 1996, and although his wife and most of his friends urged him not to run, Gorbachev decided to do so [475] He hated the idea that the election would result in a run-off between Yeltsin and Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation candidate whom Yeltsin saw as a Stalinist hardliner He never expected to win outright but thought a centrist bloc could be formed around either himself or one of the other candidates with similar views, such as Grigory Yavlinsky, Svyatoslav Fyodorov, or Alexander Lebed [476] After securing the necessary one million signatures of nomination, he announced his candidacy in March [477] Launching his campaign, he traveled across Russia giving rallies in twenty cities [477] He repeatedly faced anti-Gorbachev protesters, while some pro-Yeltsin local officials tried to hamper his campaign by banning local media from covering it or by refusing him access to venues [478] In the election, Gorbachev came seventh with approximately 386,000 votes, or around 0.5% of the total [479] Yeltsin and Zyuganov went through to the second round, where the former was victorious [479]\n\n\n1999–2008: promoting social democracy in Putin's Russia\nIn December 1999, Yeltsin resigned and was succeeded by his deputy, Vladimir Putin, who then won the March 2000 presidential election [480] Gorbachev attended Putin's inauguration ceremony in May, the first time he had entered the Kremlin since 1991 [481] Gorbachev initially welcomed Putin's rise, seeing him as an anti-Yeltsin figure [462] Although he spoke out against some of the Putin government's actions, Gorbachev also had praise for the new government; in 2002, he said: \"I've been in the same skin That's what allows me to say that what  [Putin] has done is in the interest of the majority.\" [482] At the time, he believed Putin to be a committed democrat who nevertheless had to use \"a certain dose of authoritarianism\" to stabilize the economy and rebuild the state after the Yeltsin era [481] At Putin's request, Gorbachev became co-chair of the \"Petersburg Dialogue\" project between high-ranking Russians and Germans [480]\n\n\n2008–2022: growing criticism of Putin and foreign policy remarks\nBarred by the constitution from serving more than two consecutive terms as president, Putin stood down in 2008 and was succeeded by his chosen successor, Dmitry Medvedev, who reached out to Gorbachev in ways that Putin had not [486] In September 2008, Gorbachev and business oligarch Alexander Lebedev announced they would form the Independent Democratic Party of Russia, [492] and in May 2009 Gorbachev announced that the launch was imminent [493] After the outbreak of the Russo-Georgian War between Russia and South Ossetian separatists on one side and Georgia on the other, Gorbachev spoke out against US support for Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili and for moving to bring the Caucasus into the sphere of its national interest [494] [495] Gorbachev nevertheless remained critical of Russia's government and criticized the 2011 parliamentary elections as being rigged in favor of the governing party, United Russia, and called for them to be re-held [496] After protests broke out in Moscow over the election, Gorbachev praised the protesters [496]\n\n\nPolitical ideology\nEven before he left office, Gorbachev had become a kind of social democrat—believing in, as he later put it, equality of opportunity, publicly supported education and medical care, a guaranteed minimum of social welfare, and a \"socially oriented market economy\"—all within a democratic political framework Exactly when this transformation occurred is hard to say, but surely by 1989 or 1990 it had taken place.\n\n\nPersonal life\nBy 1955, Gorbachev's hair was thinning, [554] and by the late 1960s he was bald, [555] revealing a distinctive port-wine stain on the top of his head [556] Gorbachev reached an adult height of 5 foot 9 inches (1.75 m) [557] Throughout the 1960s, he struggled against obesity and dieted to control the problem; [87] Doder and Branson characterized him as \"stocky but not fat\" [557] He spoke in a southern Russian accent, [558] and was known to sing both folk and pop songs [559]\n\n\nPersonality\nGorbachev's university friend, Mlynář, described him as \"loyal and personally honest\" [576] He was self-confident, [577] polite, [562] and tactful; [562] he had a happy and optimistic temperament [578] He used self-deprecating humor, [579] and sometimes profanities, [579] and often referred to himself in the third person [580] He was a skilled manager, [82] and had a good memory [581] A hard worker or workaholic, [582] as general secretary, he would rise at 7:00 or 8:00 in the morning and not go to bed until 1:00 or 2:00 [583] He commuted from the western suburbs between 9 and 10 in the morning and returned home around 8 in the evening [584] Taubman called him \"a remarkably decent man\"; [563] he thought Gorbachev to have \"high moral standards\" [585]\n\n\nDeath\nGorbachev died at the Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow on 30 August 2022, [597] at the age of 91 [598] He died after a \"severe and prolonged illness,\" according to the hospital [599] [600] [601]\n\n\nPreceding deterioration of health\nFor a number of years before his death, Gorbachev suffered from severe diabetes and underwent several surgeries and hospital stays [602] In April 2011, Gorbachev underwent complex spinal surgery in Germany, at the Munich clinic Schön Klinik München Harlaching [603] On 11 June 2013, it was reported that Gorbachev was hospitalized for a routine examination Two months earlier, he had not come to the funeral of Margaret Thatcher for health reasons [602] On 22 October 2013, it became known that Gorbachev was undergoing another examination in a German clinic [604] He was also hospitalized in the Central Clinical Hospital on 9 October 2014 [605] Also in 2014, Gorbachev underwent oral surgery [496] Gorbachev was briefly hospitalized in May 2015 as well [606] In November 2016, Gorbachev had a pacemaker installed at the Moscow Central Clinical Hospital [607] Also in 2016, he underwent surgery to replace his lenses due to cataracts [608]\n\n\nFuneral and burial\nA funeral for Gorbachev was held on 3 September 2022 from 10 a.m to 12 noon in the Column Hall of the House of Unions The ceremony included an honor guard, but was not an official state funeral [617] The service included rites administered by a Russian Orthodox priest [618] [619]\n\n\nReactions\nRussian president Vladimir Putin expressed his condolences on the death of Gorbachev, [620] and paid tribute to him at the Moscow hospital where the ex-president had died but, according to spokesman Dmitry Peskov, had no time to attend his funeral due to a busy work schedule Putin also sent a telegram to Gorbachev's family, calling him \"a politician and statesman who had a huge impact on the course of world history\" [621] Russian prime minister Mikhail Mishustin called Gorbachev an \"outstanding statesman\" [622] Other reactions were less positive, with the leader of Russia's Communist Party, Gennady Zyuganov, stating that Gorbachev was a leader whose rule brought \"absolute sadness, misfortune and problems\" for \"all the peoples of our country\" [623] Naina Yeltsina, widow of former Russian president Boris Yeltsin, said that Gorbachev \"sincerely wanted to change the Soviet system\" and transform the USSR into a \"free and peaceful state\" [624]\n\n\nReception and legacy\nOpinions on Gorbachev are deeply divided [580] According to a 2017 survey carried out by the independent institute Levada Center, 46% of Russian citizens have a negative opinion towards Gorbachev, 30% are indifferent, while only 15% have a positive opinion [636] Many, particularly in Western countries, see him as the greatest statesman of the second half of the 20th century [637] US press referred to the presence of \"Gorbymania\" in Western countries during the late 1980s and early 1990s, as represented by large crowds that turned out to greet his visits, [638] with Time naming him its \"Man of the Decade\" in the 1980s [639] In the Soviet Union itself, opinion polls indicated that Gorbachev was the most popular politician from 1985 through to late 1989 [640] For his domestic supporters, Gorbachev was seen as a reformer trying to modernise the Soviet Union, [641] and to build a form of democratic socialism [642] Taubman characterized Gorbachev as \"a visionary who changed his country and the world—though neither as much as he wished\" [643] Taubman regarded Gorbachev as being \"exceptional .. as a Russian ruler and a world statesman\", highlighting that he avoided the \"traditional, authoritarian, anti-Western norm\" of both predecessors like Brezhnev and successors like Putin [644] McCauley thought that in allowing the Soviet Union to move away from Marxism–Leninism, Gorbachev gave the Soviet people \"something precious, the right to think and manage their lives for themselves\", with all the uncertainty and risk that that entailed [645]\n\n\nAwards and honors\nIn 1988, India awarded Gorbachev the Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development; [659] in 1990, he was given the Nobel Peace Prize for \"his leading role in the peace process which today characterizes important parts of the international community\" [660] Out of office he continued to receive honors In 1992, he was the first recipient of the Ronald Reagan Freedom Award, [661] and in 1994 was given the Grawemeyer Award by the University of Louisville, Kentucky [662] In 1995, he was awarded the Grand-Cross of the Order of Liberty by Portuguese president Mário Soares, [663] and in 1998 the Freedom Award from the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, Tennessee [664] In 2000, he was presented with the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement at an awards ceremony at Hampton Court Palace near London [665] In 2002, Gorbachev received the Freedom of the City of Dublin from Dublin City Council [666]\n\n\nBibliography\nIn 2020/2021, the Theatre of Nations in Moscow, in collaboration with Latvian director Alvis Hermanis, staged a production called Gorbachev [670] Yevgeny Mironov and Chulpan Khamatova played the roles of Gorbachev and his wife Raisa respectively [671]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nIn 2020/2021, the Theatre of Nations in Moscow, in collaboration with Latvian director Alvis Hermanis, staged a production called Gorbachev [670] Yevgeny Mironov and Chulpan Khamatova played the roles of Gorbachev and his wife Raisa respectively [671]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Mikhail Gorbachev\n\nMikhail Gorbachev was a Soviet politician who served as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1985 to 1991. He is widely credited with playing a crucial role in the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War.\n\n## Early Life and Education\n\nGorbachev was born on March 2, 1931, in Privolnoye, a village in the North Caucasus Krai of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Soviet Union. His paternal family were ethnic Russians and had moved to the region from Voronezh several generations before. His maternal family were of ethnic Ukrainian heritage and had migrated from Chernihiv. Gorbachev's parents named him Viktor at birth, but at the insistence of his mother, a devout Orthodox Christian, he had a secret baptism, where his grandfather christened him Mikhail.\n\nGorbachev's relationship with his father, Sergey Andreyevich Gorbachev, was close, but his mother, Maria Panteleyevna Gorbacheva (née Gopkalo), was colder and punitive. The family lived as peasants and had married as teenagers in 1928. Gorbachev's parents were poor, and he had to work from an early age to support the family.\n\n## 1931-1950: Childhood\n\nGorbachev was born on March 2, 1931, in Privolnoye, a village in the North Caucasus Krai of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Soviet Union. At the time, Privolnoye was divided almost evenly between ethnic Russians and ethnic Ukrainians. Gorbachev's paternal family were ethnic Russians and had moved to the region from Voronezh several generations before; his maternal family were of ethnic Ukrainian heritage and had migrated from Chernihiv.\n\nGorbachev's parents named him Viktor at birth, but at the insistence of his mother—a devout Orthodox Christian—he had a secret baptism, where his grandfather christened him Mikhail. Gorbachev's relationship with his father, Sergey Andreyevich Gorbachev, was close; his mother, Maria Panteleyevna Gorbacheva (née Gopkalo), was colder and punitive.\n\n## 1950-1955: University\n\nIn 1950, Gorbachev began studying law at Moscow State University. He was a talented student and became involved in student politics, joining the Komsomol, the youth wing of the Communist Party. Gorbachev's university friend, Mlynář, described him as \"loyal and personally honest.\" He was self-confident, polite, and tactful, with a happy and optimistic temperament.\n\n## 1955-1969: Early Career\n\nAfter graduating from university in 1955, Gorbachev began working as a prosecutor in the Stavropol region. He was a hard worker and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming the regional procurator in 1962. Gorbachev's skills as a manager and his ability to get things done earned him recognition within the party.\n\n## 1970-1977: Heading the Stavropol Region\n\nIn April 1970, Yefremov was promoted to a higher position in Moscow, and Gorbachev succeeded him as the First Secretary of the Stavropol kraikom. This granted Gorbachev significant power over the Stavropol region. He had been personally vetted for the position by senior Kremlin leaders and was informed of their decision by the Soviet leader, Leonid Brezhnev.\n\n## 1978-1984: Secretary of the Central Committee\n\nIn November 1978, Gorbachev was appointed a Secretary of the Central Committee. His appointment had been approved unanimously by the Central Committee's members. Gorbachev was given the task of analyzing the party's policies and making recommendations for change. He began to distance himself from the conservative wing of the party, which was opposed to any significant reforms.\n\n## 1985-1986: Early Years\n\nIn March 1985, Chernenko died, and Gorbachev was unanimously elected as his successor. He became the eighth leader of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev's first public appearance as leader was at Chernenko's Red Square funeral, held on March 14. Two months after being elected, he left Moscow for the first time, traveling to Leningrad, where he spoke to assembled crowds.\n\n## 1985-1986: Domestic Policies\n\nGorbachev's leadership style differed from that of his predecessors. He would stop to talk to civilians on the street, forbade the display of his portrait at the 1985 Red Square holiday celebrations, and encouraged frank and open discussions at Politburo meetings. Gorbachev was concerned by the country's low productivity, poor work ethic, and inferior quality goods. He was worried that the country would become a second-rate power if these problems were not addressed.\n\n## 1986-1989: Further Reforms\n\nIn January 1987, Gorbachev attended a Central Committee plenum where he talked about perestroika and democratization while criticizing widespread corruption. He considered putting a proposal to allow multi-party elections into his speech, but decided against doing so. After the plenum, Gorbachev focused his attentions on economic reform, holding discussions with government officials and economists.\n\n## 1989-1991: Congress of People's Deputies\n\nIn June 1988, Gorbachev convened the 19th Party Conference, which was attended by a broader range of people than previous conferences. He proposed the formation of a new institution, the Congress of People's Deputies, whose members were to be elected in a largely free vote. This congress would in turn elect a USSR Supreme Soviet, which would do most of the legislating.\n\n## 1990-1991: Presidency and Final Days\n\nIn February 1990, both liberalizers and Marxist-Leninist hardliners intensified their attacks on Gorbachev. A liberalizer march took place in Moscow criticizing Communist Party rule. At a Central Committee meeting, the hardliner Vladimir Brovikov accused Gorbachev of reducing the country to \"anarchy\" and \"ruin\" and of pursuing Western approval at the expense of the Soviet Union and the Marxist-Leninist cause.\n\n## Post-USSR Life\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990 for his leading role in the peaceful dissolution of the Soviet Union. He continued to be involved in politics, serving as the leader of the Gorbachev Foundation, a think tank that promotes democracy and reform. Gorbachev also wrote several books on politics and history, including his memoirs.\n\n## Death and Funeral\n\nMikhail Gorbachev died on August 30, 2022, at the age of 91, after a severe and prolonged illness. He died at the Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow. Gorbachev's funeral was held on September 3, 2022, at the Column Hall of the House of Unions. The ceremony included an honor guard, but was not an official state funeral.\n\n## Reception and Legacy\n\nGorbachev's legacy is complex and contested. Some view him as a hero who brought about significant reforms and ended the Cold War, while others see him as a traitor who weakened the Soviet Union and paved the way for its collapse. In Russia, opinion on Gorbachev is divided, with some viewing him as a national hero and others seeing him as a symbol of the country's decline. Internationally, Gorbachev is widely credited with playing a crucial role in the end of the Cold War and the collapse of Soviet-era communism.\n\n## Awards and Honors\n\nThroughout his career, Gorbachev was awarded numerous honors and awards, including the Nobel Peace Prize, the Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development, and the Grawemeyer Award. He was also awarded the Grand-Cross of the Order of Liberty by the President of Portugal.\n\n## Bibliography\n\nGorbachev wrote several books on politics and history, including his memoirs, which were published in 1995. His books provide a unique insight into the inner workings of the Soviet Union and the events that led to its collapse.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Perestroika\n* Glasnost\n* Soviet Union\n* Cold War\n* Mikhail Gorbachev Foundation\n\nSources:\n\n* Gorbachev, M.

he established a discussion circle in Gorkaya Balka village to help its peasant residents gain social contacts [60]\n\n\n1955–1969: Stavropol Komsomol\nIn August 1955, Gorbachev started work at the Stavropol regional procurator's office, but disliked the job and used his contacts to get a transfer to work for Komsomol, [58] becoming deputy director of Komsomol's agitation and propaganda department for that region [59] In this position, he visited villages in the area and tried to improve the lives of their inhabitants; he established a discussion circle in Gorkaya Balka village to help its peasant residents gain social contacts [60]\n\n\n1970–1977: heading the Stavropol region\nIn April 1970, Yefremov was promoted to a higher position in Moscow and Gorbachev succeeded him as the First Secretary of the Stavropol kraikom This granted Gorbachev significant power over the Stavropol region [95] He had been personally vetted for the position by senior Kremlin leaders and was informed of their decision by the Soviet leader, Leonid Brezhnev [96] Aged 39, he was considerably younger than his predecessors in the position [97] As head of the Stavropol region, he automatically became a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (24th term) in 1971 [98] According to biographer Zhores Medvedev, Gorbachev \"had now joined the Party's super-elite\" [99] As regional leader, Gorbachev initially attributed economic and other failures to \"the inefficiency and incompetence of cadres, flaws in management structure or gaps in legislation\", but eventually concluded that they were caused by an excessive centralization of decision making in Moscow [100] He began reading translations of restricted texts by Western Marxist authors such as Antonio Gramsci, Louis Aragon, Roger Garaudy, and Giuseppe Boffa, and came under their influence [100]\n\n\nSecretary of the Central Committee of CPSU\nIn November 1978, Gorbachev was appointed a Secretary of the Central Committee [119] His appointment had been approved unanimously by the Central Committee's members [120] To fill this position, Gorbachev and his wife moved to Moscow, where they were initially given an old dacha outside the city They then moved to another, at Sosnovka, before finally being allocated a newly built brick house [121] He was also given an apartment inside the city, but gave that to his daughter and son-in-law; Irina had begun work at Moscow's Second Medical Institute [122] As part of the Moscow political elite, Gorbachev and his wife now had access to better medical care and to specialized shops; they were also given cooks, servants, bodyguards, and secretaries, although many of these were spies for the KGB [123] In his new position, Gorbachev often worked twelve to sixteen hour days [123] He and his wife socialized little, but liked to visit Moscow's theaters and museums [124]\n\n\nLeader of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)\nOn 10 March 1985, Chernenko died [153] Gromyko proposed Gorbachev as the next general secretary; as a longstanding party member, Gromyko's recommendation carried great weight among the Central Committee [154] Gorbachev expected much opposition to his nomination as general secretary, but ultimately the rest of the Politburo supported him [155] Shortly after Chernenko's death, the Politburo unanimously elected Gorbachev as his successor; they wanted him rather than another elderly leader [156] He thus became the eighth leader of the Soviet Union [10] Few in the government imagined that he would be as radical a reformer as he proved [157] Although he was not a well-known figure to the Soviet public, there was widespread relief that the new leader was not elderly and ailing [158] Gorbachev's first public appearance as leader was at Chernenko's Red Square funeral, held on 14 March [159] Two months after being elected, he left Moscow for the first time, traveling to Leningrad, where he spoke to assembled crowds [160] In June he traveled to Ukraine, in July to Belarus, and in September to Tyumen Oblast, urging party members in these areas to take more responsibility for fixing local problems [161]\n\n\n1985–1986: early years\nGorbachev's leadership style differed from that of his predecessors He would stop to talk to civilians on the street, forbade the display of his portrait at the 1985 Red Square holiday celebrations, and encouraged frank and open discussions at Politburo meetings [162] To the West, Gorbachev was seen as a more moderate and less threatening Soviet leader; some Western commentators however believed this an act to lull Western governments into a false sense of security [163] His wife was his closest adviser, and took on the unofficial role of a \"first lady\" by appearing with him on foreign trips; her public visibility was a breach of standard practice and generated resentment [164] His other close aides were Georgy Shakhnazarov and Anatoly Chernyaev [165]\n\n\nDomestic policies\nGorbachev recurrently employed the term perestroika, first used publicly in March 1984 [174] He saw perestroika as encompassing a complex series of reforms to restructure society and the economy [175] He was concerned by the country's low productivity, poor work ethic, and inferior quality goods; [176] like several economists, he feared this would lead to the country becoming a second-rate power [177] The first stage of Gorbachev's perestroika was uskoreniye (\"acceleration\"), a term he used regularly in the first two years of his leadership [178] The Soviet Union was behind the United States in many areas of production, [179] but Gorbachev claimed that it would accelerate industrial output to match that of the US by 2000 [180] The Five Year Plan of 1985–1990 was targeted to expand machine building by 50 to 100% [181] To boost agricultural productivity, he merged five ministries and a state committee into a single entity, Agroprom, although by late 1986 he acknowledged this merger as a failure [182]\n\n\nForeign policy\nIn a May 1985 speech given to the Soviet Foreign Ministry—the first time a Soviet leader had directly addressed his country's diplomats—Gorbachev spoke of a \"radical restructuring\" of foreign policy [221] A major issue facing his leadership was Soviet involvement in the Afghan Civil War, which had then been going on for over five years [222] Over the course of the war, the Soviet Army took heavy casualties and there was much opposition to Soviet involvement among both the public and military [222] On becoming leader, Gorbachev saw withdrawal from the war as a key priority [223] In October 1985, he met with Afghan Marxist leader Babrak Karmal, urging him to acknowledge the lack of widespread public support for his government and pursue a power sharing agreement with the opposition [223] That month, the Politburo approved Gorbachev's decision to withdraw combat troops from Afghanistan, although the last troops did not leave until February 1989 [224]\n\n\n1987–1989: further reforms\nIn January 1987, Gorbachev attended a Central Committee plenum where he talked about perestroika and democratization while criticizing widespread corruption [242] He considered putting a proposal to allow multi-party elections into his speech, but decided against doing so [243] After the plenum, he focused his attentions on economic reform, holding discussions with government officials and economists [244] Many economists proposed reducing ministerial controls on the economy and allowing state-owned enterprises to set their own targets; Ryzhkov and other government figures were skeptical [245] In June, Gorbachev finished his report on economic reform It reflected a compromise: ministers would retain the ability to set output targets but these would not be considered binding [246] That month, a plenum accepted his recommendations and the Supreme Soviet passed a \"law on enterprises\" implementing the changes [247] Economic problems remained: by the late 1980s there were still widespread shortages of basic goods, rising inflation, and declining living standards [248] These stoked a number of miners' strikes in 1989 [249]\n\n\nDomestic reforms\nIn January 1987, Gorbachev attended a Central Committee plenum where he talked about perestroika and democratization while criticizing widespread corruption [242] He considered putting a proposal to allow multi-party elections into his speech, but decided against doing so [243] After the plenum, he focused his attentions on economic reform, holding discussions with government officials and economists [244] Many economists proposed reducing ministerial controls on the economy and allowing state-owned enterprises to set their own targets; Ryzhkov and other government figures were skeptical [245] In June, Gorbachev finished his report on economic reform It reflected a compromise: ministers would retain the ability to set output targets but these would not be considered binding [246] That month, a plenum accepted his recommendations and the Supreme Soviet passed a \"law on enterprises\" implementing the changes [247] Economic problems remained: by the late 1980s there were still widespread shortages of basic goods, rising inflation, and declining living standards [248] These stoked a number of miners' strikes in 1989 [249]\n\n\nForming the Congress of People's Deputies\nAlthough the next party congress was not scheduled until 1991, Gorbachev convened the 19th Party Conference in its place in June 1988 He hoped that by allowing a broader range of people to attend than at previous conferences, he would gain additional support for his reforms [269] With sympathetic officials and academics, Gorbachev drafted plans for reforms that would shift power away from the Politburo and towards the soviets While the soviets had become largely powerless bodies that rubber-stamped Politburo policies, he wanted them to become year-round legislatures He proposed the formation of a new institution, the Congress of People's Deputies, whose members were to be elected in a largely free vote [270] This congress would in turn elect a USSR Supreme Soviet, which would do most of the legislating [271]\n\n\nRelations with China and Western states\nGorbachev tried to improve relations with the UK, France, and West Germany; [285] like previous Soviet leaders, he was interested in pulling Western Europe away from US influence [286] Calling for greater pan-European co-operation, he publicly spoke of a \"Common European Home\" and of a Europe \"from the Atlantic to the Urals\" [287] In March 1987, Thatcher visited Gorbachev in Moscow; despite their ideological differences, they liked one another [288] In April 1989 he visited London, lunching with Elizabeth II [289] In May 1987, Gorbachev again visited France, and in November 1988 Mitterrand visited him in Moscow [290] The West German chancellor, Helmut Kohl, had initially offended Gorbachev by comparing him to Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels, although he later informally apologized and in October 1988 visited Moscow [291] In June 1989 Gorbachev then visited Kohl in West Germany [292] In November 1989 he also visited Italy, meeting with Pope John Paul II [293] Gorbachev's relationships with these West European leaders were typically far warmer than those he had with their Eastern Bloc counterparts [294]\n\n\nNationality question and the Eastern Bloc\nOn taking power, Gorbachev found some unrest among different national groups within the Soviet Union In December 1986, riots broke out in several Kazakh cities after a Russian was appointed head of the region [316] In 1987, Crimean Tatars protested in Moscow to demand resettlement in Crimea, the area from which they had been deported on Stalin's orders in 1944 Gorbachev ordered a commission, headed by Gromyko, to examine their situation Gromyko's report opposed calls for assisting Tatar resettlement in Crimea [317] By 1988, the Soviet \"nationality question\" was increasingly pressing [318] In February, the administration of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast officially requested that it be transferred from the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic to the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic; the majority of the region's population were ethnically Armenian and wanted unification with other majority Armenian areas [319] As rival Armenian and Azerbaijani demonstrations took place in Nagorno-Karabakh, Gorbachev called an emergency meeting of the Politburo [320] Gorbachev promised greater autonomy for Nagorno-Karabakh but refused the transfer, fearing that it would set off similar ethnic tensions and demands throughout the Soviet Union [321] In the end however, greater autonomy was never given, and instead Gorbachev ordered the further violent ethnic cleansing of Armenians in parts of Nagorno-Karabakh and the adjacent Armenian-populated Shahumyan region, in what was named Operation Ring [322]\n\n\nUnraveling of the USSR\nIn the Revolutions of 1989, most of the Marxist–Leninist states of Central and Eastern Europe held multi-party elections resulting in regime change [341] In most countries, like Poland and Hungary, this was achieved peacefully, but in Romania, the revolution turned violent, and led to Ceaușescu's overthrow and execution [341] Gorbachev was too preoccupied with domestic problems to pay much attention to these events [342] He believed that democratic elections would not lead Eastern European countries into abandoning their commitment to socialism [343] In 1989, he visited East Germany for the fortieth anniversary of its founding; [344] shortly after, in November, the East German government allowed its citizens to cross the Berlin Wall, a decision Gorbachev praised Over the following years, much of the wall was demolished [345] Neither Gorbachev nor Thatcher or Mitterrand wanted a swift reunification of Germany, aware that it would likely become the dominant European power Gorbachev wanted a gradual process of German integration but Kohl began calling for rapid reunification [346] With German reunification in 1990, many observers declared the Cold War over [347]\n\n\n1990–1991: presidency of the Soviet Union\nIn February 1990, both liberalisers and Marxist–Leninist hardliners intensified their attacks on Gorbachev [348] A liberalizer march took place in Moscow criticizing Communist Party rule, [349] while at a Central Committee meeting, the hardliner Vladimir Brovikov accused Gorbachev of reducing the country to \"anarchy\" and \"ruin\" and of pursuing Western approval at the expense of the Soviet Union and the Marxist–Leninist cause [350] Gorbachev was aware that the Central Committee could still oust him as general secretary, and so decided to reformulate the role of head of government to a presidency from which he could not be removed [351] He decided that the presidential election should be held by the Congress of People's Deputies He chose this over a public vote because he thought the latter would escalate tensions and feared that he might lose it; [352] a spring 1990 poll nevertheless still showed him as the most popular politician in the country [353]\n\n\nGerman reunification and the Gulf War\nIn January 1990, Gorbachev privately agreed to permit East German reunification with West Germany, but rejected the idea that a unified Germany could retain West Germany's NATO membership [362] His compromise that Germany might retain both NATO and Warsaw Pact memberships did not attract support [363] On 9 February 1990 in a phone conversation with James Baker, then the US secretary of state, he set out his position that \"a broadening of the NATO zone is not acceptable\" to which Baker agreed Scholars are puzzled why Gorbachev never pursued a written pledge [364] In May 1990, he visited the US for talks with President Bush; [365] there, he agreed that an independent Germany would have the right to choose its international alliances [363] Ultimately he acquiesced to the reunification on the condition that NATO troops not be posted to the territory of Eastern Germany [366] There remains some confusion over whether US secretary of state James Baker led Gorbachev to believe that NATO would not expand into other countries in Eastern Europe as well There was no oral or written US promise that explicitly said so Gorbachev himself has stated that he was only made such a promise regarding East Germany and that it was kept [367] [368] In July, Kohl visited Moscow and Gorbachev informed him that the Soviets would not oppose a reunified Germany being part of NATO [369] Domestically, Gorbachev's critics accused him of betraying the national interest; [370] more broadly, they were angry that Gorbachev had allowed the Eastern Bloc to move away from direct Soviet influence [371]\n\n\nAugust coup and government crises\nAt the 28th Communist Party Congress in July 1990, hardliners criticized the reformists, but Gorbachev was re-elected party leader with the support of three-quarters of delegates, and his choice of deputy general secretary, Vladimir Ivashko, was also elected [388] Seeking compromise with the liberalizers, Gorbachev assembled a team of both his own and Yeltsin's advisers to come up with an economic reform package: the result was the \"500 Days\" programme This called for further decentralization and some privatization [389] Gorbachev described the plan as \"modern socialism\" rather than a return to capitalism but had many doubts about it [390] In September, Yeltsin presented the plan to the Russian Supreme Soviet, which backed it [391] Many in the Communist Party and state apparatus warned against it, arguing that it would create marketplace chaos, rampant inflation, and unprecedented levels of unemployment [392] The 500 Days plan was abandoned [393] At this, Yeltsin railed against Gorbachev in an October speech, claiming that Russia would no longer accept a subordinate position to the Soviet government [394]\n\n\nFinal days and collapse\nAfter the coup, the Supreme Soviet indefinitely suspended all Communist Party activity, effectively ending communist rule in the Soviet Union [426] [427] From then on, the country collapsed with dramatic speed.\n\n\nPost-USSR life\nOut of office, Gorbachev had more time to spend with his wife and family [450] He and Raisa initially lived in their dilapidated dacha on Rublevskoe Shosse, and were also allowed to privatize their smaller apartment on Kosygin Street [450] He focused on establishing his International Foundation for Socio-Economic and Political Studies, or \"Gorbachev Foundation\", launched in March 1992; [451] Yakovlev and Revenko were its first vice presidents [452] Its initial tasks were in analyzing and publishing material on the history of perestroika, as well as defending the policy from what it called \"slander and falsifications\" The foundation also tasked itself with monitoring and critiquing life in post-Soviet Russia, presenting alternative development forms to those pursued by Yeltsin [452]\n\n\n1991–1999: initial years\nOut of office, Gorbachev had more time to spend with his wife and family [450] He and Raisa initially lived in their dilapidated dacha on Rublevskoe Shosse, and were also allowed to privatize their smaller apartment on Kosygin Street [450] He focused on establishing his International Foundation for Socio-Economic and Political Studies, or \"Gorbachev Foundation\", launched in March 1992; [451] Yakovlev and Revenko were its first vice presidents [452] Its initial tasks were in analyzing and publishing material on the history of perestroika, as well as defending the policy from what it called \"slander and falsifications\" The foundation also tasked itself with monitoring and critiquing life in post-Soviet Russia, presenting alternative development forms to those pursued by Yeltsin [452]\n\n\n1996 presidential campaign\nThe Russian presidential elections were scheduled for June 1996, and although his wife and most of his friends urged him not to run, Gorbachev decided to do so [475] He hated the idea that the election would result in a run-off between Yeltsin and Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation candidate whom Yeltsin saw as a Stalinist hardliner He never expected to win outright but thought a centrist bloc could be formed around either himself or one of the other candidates with similar views, such as Grigory Yavlinsky, Svyatoslav Fyodorov, or Alexander Lebed [476] After securing the necessary one million signatures of nomination, he announced his candidacy in March [477] Launching his campaign, he traveled across Russia giving rallies in twenty cities [477] He repeatedly faced anti-Gorbachev protesters, while some pro-Yeltsin local officials tried to hamper his campaign by banning local media from covering it or by refusing him access to venues [478] In the election, Gorbachev came seventh with approximately 386,000 votes, or around 0.5% of the total [479] Yeltsin and Zyuganov went through to the second round, where the former was victorious [479]\n\n\n1999–2008: promoting social democracy in Putin's Russia\nIn December 1999, Yeltsin resigned and was succeeded by his deputy, Vladimir Putin, who then won the March 2000 presidential election [480] Gorbachev attended Putin's inauguration ceremony in May, the first time he had entered the Kremlin since 1991 [481] Gorbachev initially welcomed Putin's rise, seeing him as an anti-Yeltsin figure [462] Although he spoke out against some of the Putin government's actions, Gorbachev also had praise for the new government; in 2002, he said: \"I've been in the same skin That's what allows me to say that what  [Putin] has done is in the interest of the majority.\" [482] At the time, he believed Putin to be a committed democrat who nevertheless had to use \"a certain dose of authoritarianism\" to stabilize the economy and rebuild the state after the Yeltsin era [481] At Putin's request, Gorbachev became co-chair of the \"Petersburg Dialogue\" project between high-ranking Russians and Germans [480]\n\n\n2008–2022: growing criticism of Putin and foreign policy remarks\nBarred by the constitution from serving more than two consecutive terms as president, Putin stood down in 2008 and was succeeded by his chosen successor, Dmitry Medvedev, who reached out to Gorbachev in ways that Putin had not [486] In September 2008, Gorbachev and business oligarch Alexander Lebedev announced they would form the Independent Democratic Party of Russia, [492] and in May 2009 Gorbachev announced that the launch was imminent [493] After the outbreak of the Russo-Georgian War between Russia and South Ossetian separatists on one side and Georgia on the other, Gorbachev spoke out against US support for Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili and for moving to bring the Caucasus into the sphere of its national interest [494] [495] Gorbachev nevertheless remained critical of Russia's government and criticized the 2011 parliamentary elections as being rigged in favor of the governing party, United Russia, and called for them to be re-held [496] After protests broke out in Moscow over the election, Gorbachev praised the protesters [496]\n\n\nPolitical ideology\nEven before he left office, Gorbachev had become a kind of social democrat—believing in, as he later put it, equality of opportunity, publicly supported education and medical care, a guaranteed minimum of social welfare, and a \"socially oriented market economy\"—all within a democratic political framework Exactly when this transformation occurred is hard to say, but surely by 1989 or 1990 it had taken place.\n\n\nPersonal life\nBy 1955, Gorbachev's hair was thinning, [554] and by the late 1960s he was bald, [555] revealing a distinctive port-wine stain on the top of his head [556] Gorbachev reached an adult height of 5 foot 9 inches (1.75 m) [557] Throughout the 1960s, he struggled against obesity and dieted to control the problem; [87] Doder and Branson characterized him as \"stocky but not fat\" [557] He spoke in a southern Russian accent, [558] and was known to sing both folk and pop songs [559]\n\n\nPersonality\nGorbachev's university friend, Mlynář, described him as \"loyal and personally honest\" [576] He was self-confident, [577] polite, [562] and tactful; [562] he had a happy and optimistic temperament [578] He used self-deprecating humor, [579] and sometimes profanities, [579] and often referred to himself in the third person [580] He was a skilled manager, [82] and had a good memory [581] A hard worker or workaholic, [582] as general secretary, he would rise at 7:00 or 8:00 in the morning and not go to bed until 1:00 or 2:00 [583] He commuted from the western suburbs between 9 and 10 in the morning and returned home around 8 in the evening [584] Taubman called him \"a remarkably decent man\"; [563] he thought Gorbachev to have \"high moral standards\" [585]\n\n\nDeath\nGorbachev died at the Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow on 30 August 2022, [597] at the age of 91 [598] He died after a \"severe and prolonged illness,\" according to the hospital [599] [600] [601]\n\n\nPreceding deterioration of health\nFor a number of years before his death, Gorbachev suffered from severe diabetes and underwent several surgeries and hospital stays [602] In April 2011, Gorbachev underwent complex spinal surgery in Germany, at the Munich clinic Schön Klinik München Harlaching [603] On 11 June 2013, it was reported that Gorbachev was hospitalized for a routine examination Two months earlier, he had not come to the funeral of Margaret Thatcher for health reasons [602] On 22 October 2013, it became known that Gorbachev was undergoing another examination in a German clinic [604] He was also hospitalized in the Central Clinical Hospital on 9 October 2014 [605] Also in 2014, Gorbachev underwent oral surgery [496] Gorbachev was briefly hospitalized in May 2015 as well [606] In November 2016, Gorbachev had a pacemaker installed at the Moscow Central Clinical Hospital [607] Also in 2016, he underwent surgery to replace his lenses due to cataracts [608]\n\n\nFuneral and burial\nA funeral for Gorbachev was held on 3 September 2022 from 10 a.m to 12 noon in the Column Hall of the House of Unions The ceremony included an honor guard, but was not an official state funeral [617] The service included rites administered by a Russian Orthodox priest [618] [619]\n\n\nReactions\nRussian president Vladimir Putin expressed his condolences on the death of Gorbachev, [620] and paid tribute to him at the Moscow hospital where the ex-president had died but, according to spokesman Dmitry Peskov, had no time to attend his funeral due to a busy work schedule Putin also sent a telegram to Gorbachev's family, calling him \"a politician and statesman who had a huge impact on the course of world history\" [621] Russian prime minister Mikhail Mishustin called Gorbachev an \"outstanding statesman\" [622] Other reactions were less positive, with the leader of Russia's Communist Party, Gennady Zyuganov, stating that Gorbachev was a leader whose rule brought \"absolute sadness, misfortune and problems\" for \"all the peoples of our country\" [623] Naina Yeltsina, widow of former Russian president Boris Yeltsin, said that Gorbachev \"sincerely wanted to change the Soviet system\" and transform the USSR into a \"free and peaceful state\" [624]\n\n\nReception and legacy\nOpinions on Gorbachev are deeply divided [580] According to a 2017 survey carried out by the independent institute Levada Center, 46% of Russian citizens have a negative opinion towards Gorbachev, 30% are indifferent, while only 15% have a positive opinion [636] Many, particularly in Western countries, see him as the greatest statesman of the second half of the 20th century [637] US press referred to the presence of \"Gorbymania\" in Western countries during the late 1980s and early 1990s, as represented by large crowds that turned out to greet his visits, [638] with Time naming him its \"Man of the Decade\" in the 1980s [639] In the Soviet Union itself, opinion polls indicated that Gorbachev was the most popular politician from 1985 through to late 1989 [640] For his domestic supporters, Gorbachev was seen as a reformer trying to modernise the Soviet Union, [641] and to build a form of democratic socialism [642] Taubman characterized Gorbachev as \"a visionary who changed his country and the world—though neither as much as he wished\" [643] Taubman regarded Gorbachev as being \"exceptional .. as a Russian ruler and a world statesman\", highlighting that he avoided the \"traditional, authoritarian, anti-Western norm\" of both predecessors like Brezhnev and successors like Putin [644] McCauley thought that in allowing the Soviet Union to move away from Marxism–Leninism, Gorbachev gave the Soviet people \"something precious, the right to think and manage their lives for themselves\", with all the uncertainty and risk that that entailed [645]\n\n\nAwards and honors\nIn 1988, India awarded Gorbachev the Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development; [659] in 1990, he was given the Nobel Peace Prize for \"his leading role in the peace process which today characterizes important parts of the international community\" [660] Out of office he continued to receive honors In 1992, he was the first recipient of the Ronald Reagan Freedom Award, [661] and in 1994 was given the Grawemeyer Award by the University of Louisville, Kentucky [662] In 1995, he was awarded the Grand-Cross of the Order of Liberty by Portuguese president Mário Soares, [663] and in 1998 the Freedom Award from the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, Tennessee [664] In 2000, he was presented with the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement at an awards ceremony at Hampton Court Palace near London [665] In 2002, Gorbachev received the Freedom of the City of Dublin from Dublin City Council [666]\n\n\nBibliography\nIn 2020/2021, the Theatre of Nations in Moscow, in collaboration with Latvian director Alvis Hermanis, staged a production called Gorbachev [670] Yevgeny Mironov and Chulpan Khamatova played the roles of Gorbachev and his wife Raisa respectively [671]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nIn 2020/2021, the Theatre of Nations in Moscow, in collaboration with Latvian director Alvis Hermanis, staged a production called Gorbachev [670] Yevgeny Mironov and Chulpan Khamatova played the roles of Gorbachev and his wife Raisa respectively [671]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

house, get out from under my father, which was one of the most difficult things that I had to do.\" [18] Attempting a third album, Jackson teamed with producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis They set out to achieve crossover pop appeal, while also creating a strong foundation within the urban market [26] Within six weeks, Jackson and the duo crafted her third studio album, Control, released in

to Control, Jackson chose to include a socially conscious theme among various musical styles [44] She stated, \"I know an album or a song can't change the world I just want my music and my dance to catch the audience's attention, and to hold it long enough for them to listen to the lyrics.\" [45] The album's central theme of unity was developed in response to various crimes and tragedies

belong Aside from encompassing lyrics relating to social issues such as same-sex relationships, homophobia and domestic violence, it also contains themes of sadomasochism and is considered far more sexually explicit in nature than her previous release, Janet [18] [97]\n\n\n2000–2003: Nutty Professor II: The Klumps and All for You\nIn July 2000, Jackson appeared in her second film, Nutty

multi-platinum, award-winning American singer, songwriter, dancer, and actress. Born on May 16, 1966, in Gary, Indiana, Jackson is the youngest sibling in the renowned Jackson family. With a career spanning over four decades, she has established herself as one of the most successful and influential artists in the entertainment industry.\n\n**Life and Career**\n\nJanet Jackson was born to Katherine Esther Jackson (née Scruse) and Joseph Walter \"Joe\" Jackson. Her mother was a homemaker and a part-time worker, while her father was a crane operator and a musician who played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons. The Jackson family was composed of ten children, including Janet's siblings Rebbie, La Toya, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, Michael, and Randy. Another brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after birth.\n\nGrowing up in a devout Jehovah's Witnesses family, Jackson was exposed to music from a young age. Her mother played piano and clarinet, and her father played guitar. The Jackson children were often encouraged to perform and entertain, which laid the foundation for Janet's future career. As a child, Jackson was heavily influenced by musicals and watched many classic movies, including \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Singin' in the Rain.\" She was also inspired by the choreography of Fred Astaire and Michael Kidd, among others.\n\n**1966–1985: Early Life and Career Beginnings**\n\nJanet Jackson's early years were marked by her involvement in her family's music and performance activities. She began singing and dancing at a young age and was often accompanied by her siblings on stage. In 1972, Jackson joined her siblings in performing on the family's variety show, \"The Jacksons,\" which was a regular feature on the television show \"The Jacksons.\" The show was later renamed \"The Jackson Family Music and Variety Show\" and ran for two seasons.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Jackson began to pursue a solo music career. She signed with A&M Records and released her debut album, \"Janet Jackson,\" in 1982. The album was moderately successful, but it laid the groundwork for her future success. Jackson's second album, \"Dream Street,\" was released in 1984 and featured the hit single \"Don't Stand Another Chance.\" The song became a top-ten hit on the R&B charts and established Jackson as a rising star in the music industry.\n\n**1986–1988: Control**\n\nIn 1986, Jackson terminated her business affairs with her family, stating, \"I just wanted to get out of the house, get out from under my father, which was one of the most difficult things that I had to do.\" She teamed with producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis to achieve crossover pop appeal while creating a strong foundation within the urban market. Within six weeks, Jackson and the duo crafted her third studio album, \"Control,\" released in February 1986. The album shot to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and was certified fivefold Platinum by the RIAA, selling over ten million copies worldwide.\n\n**1989–1992: Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814**\n\nJackson released her fourth album, \"Rhythm Nation 1814,\" in September 1989. Although her record label desired a direct sequel to \"Control,\" Jackson chose to include a socially conscious theme among various musical styles. She stated, \"I know an album or a song can't change the world. I just want my music and my dance to catch the audience's attention, and to hold it long enough for them to listen to the lyrics.\" The album's central theme of unity was developed in response to various crimes and tragedies reported in the media.\n\n**1993–1996: Janet, Poetic Justice, and Design of a Decade**\n\nJackson's fifth studio album, \"Janet,\" was released in May 1993.

Jackson returned with a dramatic change in image, boasting vibrant red hair, nasal piercings, and tattoos. The album is primarily centered on the idea that everyone has an intrinsic need to belong. Aside from encompassing lyrics relating to social issues such as same-sex relationships, homophobia, and domestic violence, it also contains themes of sadomasochism and is considered far more sexually explicit in nature than her previous release, \"Janet.\"\n\n**2000–2003: Nutty Professor II: The Klumps and All for You**\n\nIn July 2000, Jackson appeared in her second film, \"Nutty Professor II: The Klumps,\" as the role of Professor Denise Gaines, opposite Eddie Murphy.

song was performed on the ninth season finale of American Idol along with \"Again\" and \"Nasty\" [199]\n\n\n2015–2019: Unbreakable, touring and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\nOn May 16, 2015, Jackson announced plans to release a new album and to embark on a world concert tour [217] [218] She outlined her intention to release her new album in the fall of 2015 under her own record label, Rhythm Nation, distributed by BMG Rights Management [219] The launch of Rhythm Nation established Jackson as one of the few African-American female musicians to own a record label [220]\n\n\n2020–present: Documentaries and Together Again Tour\nA two-part documentary titled Janet Jackson for Lifetime and A&E premiered on January 28 and 29, 2022, respectively [263] [264] Jackson previewed a clip of a new song, \"Luv I Luv\", during the end credits of the last episode of her documentary [265] Jackson was set to embark on the Black Diamond World Tour in 2020 [266] Later that year, the tour was postponed indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic [267] She also announced her upcoming twelfth studio album Black Diamond, which was scheduled for a 2020 release [266]\n\n\nArtistry\nJackson possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range [272] Over the course of her career, she has received frequent criticism for the limitations of her vocal capabilities, especially in comparison to contemporary artists such as Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey [273] In comparing her vocal technique to Houston and Aretha Franklin, vocal coach Roger Love states that \" [w]hen Janet sings, she allows a tremendous amount of air to come through She's obviously aiming for a sexy, sultry effect, and on one level that works nicely But actually, it's fairly limited.\" He adds that while her voice is suitable for studio recording, it doesn't translate well to the stage because despite having \"great songs, incredible dancing, and her star-like presence, the live show is still magnificent But the voice is not the star.\" [274]\n\n\nMusic and voice\nJackson possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range [272] Over the course of her career, she has received frequent criticism for the limitations of her vocal

the live show is still magnificent But the voice is not the star.\" [274]\n\n\nVideos and stage\nJackson drew inspiration for her music videos and performances from musicals she watched in her youth, and was heavily influenced by the choreography of Fred Astaire and Michael Kidd, among others [297] Throughout her career, she has worked with and brought numerous professional choreographers to prominence, such as Tina Landon, Paula Abdul, and Michael Kidd [298] Veronica Chambers declared, \"Her impact on pop music is undeniable and far-reaching,\" adding, \"A quick glance at the Billboard chart reveals any number of artists cast in the Janet Jackson mold.\" Chambers observed numerous videos which \"features not only Ms Jackson's dancers, but choreography and sets remarkably like those she has used.\" [299]\n\n\nInfluences\nJackson describes Lena Horne as a profound inspiration, for entertainers of several generations as well as herself Upon Horne's death, she stated \" [Horne] brought much joy into everyone's lives—even the younger generations, younger than myself She was such a great talent She opened up such doors for artists like myself.\" [316] Similarly, she considers Dorothy Dandridge to be one of her idols [317]\n\n\nLegacy and influence\nThe youngest sister of the \"precious Jackson clan\", [322] Janet Jackson has striven to distance her professional career from that of her older brother Michael and the rest of the Jackson family Steve Dollar of Newsday wrote that \" [s]he projects that home girl-next-door quality that belies her place as the youngest sibling in a family whose inner and outer lives have been as poked at, gossiped about, docudramatized and hard-copied as the Kennedys.\" [323] Phillip McCarthy of The Sydney Morning Herald noted that throughout her recording career, one of her common conditions for interviewers has been that there would be no mention of Michael [324] Joshua Klein wrote, \" [f]or the first half of her recording career, Janet Jackson sounded like an artist with something to prove Emerging in 1982 just as big brother Michael was casting his longest shadow, Jackson filled her albums not so much with songs as with declarations, from 'The Pleasure Principle' to the radical-sounding 'Rhythm Nation' to the telling statement of purpose, 'Control'.\" [294]\n\n\nPersonal life\nAt age 18, Janet Jackson eloped with singer James DeBarge in September 1984 The marriage was annulled in November 1985 [379] In 1986, Jackson began dating dancer, songwriter, and director René Elizondo Jr [380] In March 1991, Jackson married Elizondo Jr and the union was kept a secret until the divorce was made public [381] Elizondo filed a lawsuit against her, estimated to have been between $10–25 million [382] a settlement was reached and the divorce was finalized in October 2003 [383] [384] From 2002 to 2009, Jackson dated music producer, rapper, and songwriter Jermaine Dupri.\n\n\nComments on Kamala Harris\nIn September 2024, Jackson gave an interview to The Guardian, during which she claimed that she heard that U.S Vice President and presidential candidate Kamala Harris was \"not Black\": \"Her father's white That's what I was told I mean, I haven't watched the news in a few days I was told that they discovered her father was white\"; Harris's father, Donald J Harris, immigrated to the United States from Jamaica [389] Some media outlets later reported a statement from Mo Elmasri, who said he was Jackson's manager, and claimed that Jackson was apologizing and retracting her remarks [390] It was later found that Elmasri was not authorized to speak on her behalf when he issued the statement [391]\n\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n\n\nFilmography\nConcert tours\n\n\nTours and

The incident involved the band's tour bus dumping a large amount of dark, untreated waste into the Chicago River, causing widespread public outcry and sparking a heated debate about the need for better waste management practices in the entertainment industry.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Dave Matthews Band had booked rooms at the Peninsula Hotel on 108 E Superior Street for a two-night show at Alpine Valley Music Theatre in East Troy, Wisconsin. The incident occurred between the first and second night of the concert. The band booked five buses for its show; Stefan Wohl drove the bus of the band's violinist Boyd Tinsley.\n\n**Incident**\n\nOn August 8, 2004, Wohl was alone in Tinsley's bus and driving to a downtown hotel when he emptied the bus's blackwater tank as it crossed the metal grates of the Kinzie Street Bridge. The waste, which was not treated or processed in any way, poured out of the bus and into the Chicago River below. The incident was witnessed by several people, including a woman who was on a boat on the river at the time.\n\nThe woman, who wished to remain anonymous, reported that she saw the bus driving away from the river as the waste was being dumped. She stated that the waste was dark and looked like a mixture of sewage and sludge. The incident was also captured on video by a security camera in the area, which showed the bus driving away from the river as the waste was being dumped.\n\n**Investigation**\n\nImmediately following the incident, the Chicago Police Department said they were investigating but did not yet consider it a crime. The police department launched an investigation into the incident and began to gather evidence, including witness statements and video footage.\n\nOn August 9, the Chicago Architecture Foundation released a statement that a witness had recorded license-plate information, which they had turned over to the police as evidence. The police department also began to interview witnesses and gather more information about the incident.\n\nOn August 10, bus driver Jerry Fitzpatrick, who drove for the band, was identified as the owner of the bus's license plate. In a phone interview, Fitzpatrick denied to a reporter that he had dumped the waste, asserting that he was parked in front of the band's hotel at the time.\n\nA publicist for the Dave Matthews Band issued a statement saying the band's management had determined that every one of its buses was parked at the time of the incident. The statement did not specifically address the question of who had dumped the waste, but it did acknowledge that the incident was a serious matter.\n\n**Impact and Legacy**\n\nNo passengers suffered any long-lasting physical health effects from having the waste dumped on them. However, the incident sparked a heated debate about the need for better waste management practices in the entertainment industry.\n\nIn a 2009 interview with a local radio station, Dave Matthews apologized for the incident, stating that it was a mistake and that the band did not take it seriously enough at the time. Matthews also stated that the band was taking steps to improve its waste management practices and to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\nThe incident was also cited as an example of the need for stronger regulations and enforcement in the entertainment industry. Several government agencies and regulatory bodies were criticized for their handling of the incident and for not taking stronger action to prevent it.\n\nIn 2018, the satirical website The Onion published an article about the incident, which included an edited image supposedly depicting the waste being dumped into the river. The article was widely shared on social media and sparked a wave of outrage and mockery.\n\nOn the 19th anniversary of the incident, the Riot Fest Historical Society attached a plaque to the Kinzie Street Bridge commemorating the event. The plaque reads: \"On August 8, 2004, the Dave Matthews Band's tour bus dumped a large amount of untreated waste into the Chicago River, sparking a public outcry and leading to improved waste management practices in the entertainment industry.\"\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Dave Matthews Band Chicago River incident was a high-profile environmental protest that took place on August 8, 2004, in Chicago, Illinois. The incident involved the band's tour bus dumping a large amount of dark, untreated waste into the Chicago River, causing widespread public outcry and sparking a heated debate about the need for better waste management practices in the entertainment industry. The incident led to improved waste management practices and stronger regulations in the entertainment industry, and it remains a notable example of the importance of responsible waste management and environmental stewardship.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Dave_Matthews_Band_Chicago_River_incident\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nDave Matthews Band had booked rooms at the Peninsula Hotel on 108 E Superior Street for a two-night show at Alpine Valley Music Theatre in East Troy, Wisconsin [5] The incident occurred between the first and second night of the concert The band booked five buses for its show; Stefan Wohl drove the bus of the band's violinist Boyd Tinsley.\n\n\nIncident\nOn August 8, 2004, [8] Wohl was alone in Tinsley's bus and driving to a downtown hotel when he emptied the bus's blackwater tank as it crossed the metal grates of the Kinzie Street Bridge [9]\n\n\nInvestigation\nImmediately following the incident, the Chicago Police Department said they were investigating but did not yet consider it a crime On August 9, the Chicago Architecture Foundation released a statement that a witness had recorded license-plate information, which they had turned over to the police as evidence [11] On August 10, bus driver Jerry Fitzpatrick, who drove for the band, was identified as the owner of the bus's license plate In a phone interview, Fitzpatrick denied to a Chicago Tribune reporter that he had dumped the waste, asserting that he was parked in front of the band's hotel at the time [5] A publicist for the Dave Matthews Band issued a statement saying the band's management had determined that every one of its buses was parked at the time of the incident [5]\n\n\nImpact and legacy\nNo passengers suffered any long-lasting physical health effects from having the waste dumped on them [13] In a 2009 interview with WTMX, Dave Matthews said that he'd \"apologize for  [the incident] as long as  [he has] to\" [14]  Satirical website The Onion published an article about the incident in 2018 containing an edited image supposedly depicting it [15] On August 8, 2023, the Riot Fest Historical Society attached a plaque to the Kinzie Street Bridge commemorating the 19th anniversary of the incident [16]\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Roma**\n\nAS Roma is an Italian professional football club based in Rome, Italy. The club was founded in 1927 through the merger of three older clubs: Roman FC, SS Alba-Audace, and Fortitudo-Pro Roma SGS. The team plays its home games at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, which it shares with city rivals Lazio.\n\n**History**\n\nAS Roma was founded in the spring of 1927 when Italo Foschi initiated the merger of three older Italian Football Championship clubs from the city of Rome: Roman FC, SS Alba-Audace, and Fortitudo-Pro Roma SGS. Foschi was an important Roman representative of the ruling National Fascist Party.\n\n**Foundation**\n\nAS Roma was founded in the spring of 1927 when Italo Foschi initiated the merger of three older Italian Football Championship clubs from the city of Rome: Roman FC, SS Alba-Audace, and Fortitudo-Pro Roma SGS. Foschi was an important Roman representative of the ruling National Fascist Party.\n\n**First Title Victory and Decline**\n\nAfter a slump in league form and the departure of high-key players, Roma eventually rebuilt their squad, adding goal-scorers such as the Argentine Enrique Guaita. Under the management of Luigi Barbesino, the Roman club came close to their first title in 1935-36, finishing just one point behind champions Bologna.\n\n**Time of Mixed Fortunes from the 1970s to the 1990s**\n\nRoma were able to add another cup to their collection in 1972, with a 3-1 victory over Blackpool in the Anglo-Italian Cup. During much of the 1970s, Roma's appearance in the top half of Serie A was sporadic. The best place the club were able to achieve during the decade was third in 1974-75. Notable players who turned out for the club during this period included midfielders Giancarlo De Sisti and Francesco Rocca.\n\n**Third Scudetto in the Sensi Era**\n\nRoma won their third Serie A title in 2000-01. The Scudetto was won on the last day of the season after defeating Parma 3-1, edging Juventus by two points. The club's captain, Francesco Totti, was a large reason for the title victory and he would become one of the main heroes in the club's history, breaking several club records. Other important players during this period included: Aldair, Cafu, Gabriel Batistuta, and Vincenzo Montella.\n\n**American Ownership and Pallotta Era**\n\nIn the summer of 2010, the Sensi family agreed to relinquish their control of Roma as part of a debt-settlement agreement, ending their reign that had begun in 1993. Until a new owner was appointed, Rosella Sensi continued her directorial role of the club. Following a series of poor results that saw Roma engage in a winless streak of five consecutive matches, Claudio Ranieri resigned as head coach in February 2011, and former striker Vincenzo Montella was appointed as caretaker manager until the end of the season. It was also during this season that Roma icon Francesco Totti scored his 200th Serie A goal against Fiorentina in March 2011, becoming only the sixth player to achieve such a feat.\n\n**Friedkin Era and European Success**\n\nIn December 2019, AS Roma SPV LLC was in final negotiations to sell the team for $872 million to American businessman Dan Friedkin. However, negotiations stalled during the COVID-19 pandemic. On 6 August 2020, Friedkin signed the preliminary contract to agree to pay $591 million to Pallotta, the main shareholder of Roma.\n\n**Club Identity**\n\nRoma's colours of carmine red with a golden yellow trim represent the traditional colours of Rome, the official seal of the Comune di Roma features the same colours. The gold and the purple-red represent Roman imperial dignity. White shorts and black socks are usually worn with the red shirt. However, in particularly high-key matches, the shorts and socks are the same colour as the home shirt.\n\n**Kit Suppliers and Shirt Sponsors**\n\nThe first sport facility Roma used was the Motovelodromo Appio, previously used by Alba-Audace. Roma only played the 1927-28 season there until they moved to Campo Testaccio the very next season. Campo Testaccio was used through 1929 to 1940. The team moved later to the Stadio Nazionale del PNF, where they spent 13 years before moving once again.\n\n**Facilities**\n\nThe first sport facility Roma used was the Motovelodromo Appio, previously used by Alba-Audace.

The team moved later to the Stadio Nazionale del PNF, where they spent 13 years before moving once again.\n\n**Supporters**\n\nRoma is the fifth-most supported football club in Italy – behind Juventus, Internazionale, A.C Milan, and Napoli – with approximately 7% of Italian football fans supporting the club, according to the Doxa Institute-L'Espresso's research of April 2006. Historically, the largest section of Roma supporters in the city of Rome have come from the inner-city, especially Testaccio.\n\n**Rivalries**\n\nIn Italian football, Roma is a club with many rivalries. First and foremost is their rivalry with Lazio, the club with whom they share the Stadio Olimpico. The derby between the two is called the Derby della Capitale, it is amongst the most heated and emotional footballing rivalries in the world. The fixture has seen some occasional instances of violence in the past, including the death of Lazio fan Vincenzo Paparelli in 1979-80 as a result of an emergency flare fired from the Curva Sud, and the abandonment of a match in March 2004 following unfounded rumours of a fatality which led to violence outside the stadium.\n\n**Hooliganism**\n\nRivalries with other teams have escalated into serious violence. A group of ultras who label themselves the Fedayn — 'the devotees' — after a group of long-forgotten Iranian guerrilla fighters are regarded to be responsible for the organised hooliganism. In 2014 Daniele De Santis, a Roma ultra, was convicted of shooting Ciro Esposito and two others during clashes with Napoli fans who were in Rome for their club's Coppa Italia final against Fiorentina. Esposito died of his wounds. De Santis was sentenced to 26 years in prison, later reduced to 16 years on appeal. Roma ultras have displayed banners celebrating De Santis.\n\n**Players**\n\nRoma has a strong squad with many talented players. Some of the notable players include:\n\n* Francesco Totti\n* Daniele De Rossi\n* Leandro Castán\n* Riad Bajić\n* Miralem Pjanić\n* Radja Nainggolan\n* Edin Džeko\n* Stephan El Shaarawy\n* Pedro\n* Kostas Manolas\n\n**Management Staff**\n\nRoma's management staff includes:\n\n* Claudio Ranieri (head coach)\n* Davide Ballardini (assistant coach)\n* Alessandro Tricarico (goalkeeping coach)\n* Giovanni Di Gregorio (fitness coach)\n* Luca Serafini (physical trainer)\n\n**Chairmen History**\n\nRoma have had numerous chairmen (Italian: presidenti, lit. 'presidents' or Italian: presidenti del consiglio di amministrazione, lit. 'chairmen of the board of directors') over the course of their history, some of which have been the owners and co-owners of the club, some of them were nominated by the owners.

{"title": "Lady_Diana_Spencer", "content": "\nEarly life\nDiana Frances Spencer was born on 1 July 1961, the fourth of five children of John Spencer, Viscount Althorp (1924–1992), and Frances Spencer, Viscountess Althorp (née Roche; 1936–2004) [2] She was delivered at Park House, Sandringham, Norfolk [3] The Spencer family had been closely allied with the British royal family for several generations; [4] her grandmothers, Cynthia Spencer, Countess Spencer, and Ruth Roche, Baroness Fermoy, had served as ladies-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother [5] Her parents were hoping for a boy to carry on the family line, and no name was chosen for a week until they settled on Diana Frances after her mother and Lady Diana Spencer, a many-times-great-aunt who was also a prospective Princess of Wales as a potential bride for Frederick, Prince of Wales [6] Within the family, she was also known informally as \"Duch\", a reference to her duchess-like attitude in childhood [7]\n\n\nEducation and career\nDiana was initially home-schooled under the supervision of her governess, Gertrude Allen [21] She began her formal education at Silfield Private School in King's Lynn, Norfolk, and moved to Riddlesworth Hall School, an all-girls boarding school near Thetford, when she was nine [22] She joined her sisters at West Heath Girls' School in Sevenoaks, Kent, in 1973 [23] She did not perform well academically, failing her O-levels twice [24] [25] Her outstanding community spirit was recognised with an award from West Heath [26] She left West Heath when she was sixteen [27] Her brother Charles recalls her as being quite shy up until that time [28] She demonstrated musical ability as a skilled pianist [26] She also excelled in swimming and diving, and studied ballet and tap dance [29]\n\n\nPersonal life\nDiana first met Charles, Prince of Wales, the Queen's eldest son and heir apparent, when she was 16 in November 1977 He was then 29 and dating her older sister, Sarah [39] [40] Charles and Diana were guests at a country weekend during the summer of 1980 and he took a serious interest in her as a potential bride [41] The relationship progressed when he invited her aboard the royal yacht Britannia for a sailing weekend to Cowes This was followed by an invitation to Balmoral Castle (the royal family's Scottish residence) to meet his family [42] [43] She was well received by the Queen, the Queen Mother and the Duke of Edinburgh Charles subsequently courted Diana in London He proposed on 6 February 1981 at Windsor Castle, and she accepted, but their engagement was kept secret for two and a half weeks [38]\n\n\nEngagement and wedding\nTheir engagement became official on 24 February 1981 [21] Diana selected her own engagement ring [21] Following the engagement, she left her occupation as a nursery teacher's assistant and temporarily lived at the Queen Mother's residence, Clarence House [44] She subsequently resided at Buckingham Palace until the wedding, [44] where, according to the biographer Ingrid Seward, her life was \"incredibly lonely\" [45] Diana was the first Englishwoman to marry the first in line to the throne since Anne Hyde married James, Duke of York and Albany (later James VII and II), over 300 years earlier, and she was also the first royal bride to have a paying job before her engagement [21] [26] Diana's first public appearance with Charles was at a charity ball held at Goldsmiths' Hall in March 1981, where she was introduced to Princess Grace of Monaco [44]\n\n\nChildren\nThe couple had residences at Kensington Palace and Highgrove House, near Tetbury On 5 November 1981, Diana's pregnancy was announced [53] In January 1982—12 weeks into the pregnancy—Diana fell down a staircase at Sandringham, suffering some bruising, and the royal gynaecologist George Pinker was summoned from London; the foetus was uninjured [54] Diana later confessed that she had intentionally thrown herself down the stairs because she was feeling \"so inadequate\" [55] On 21 June 1982, she gave birth to the couple's first son, Prince William [56] She subsequently suffered from postpartum depression after her first pregnancy [57] Amidst some media criticism, she decided to take William—who was still a baby—on her first major tours of Australia and New Zealand, and the decision was popularly applauded By her own admission, Diana had not initially intended to take William until Malcolm Fraser, the Australian prime minister, made the suggestion [58]\n\n\nProblems and separation\nFive years into the marriage, the couple's incompatibility and age difference became visible and damaging [66] In 1986, Diana began a relationship with James Hewitt, the family's former riding instructor and in the same year, Charles resumed his relationship with his former girlfriend Camilla Parker Bowles The media speculated that Hewitt, not Charles, was Harry's father based on the alleged physical similarity between Hewitt and Harry, but Hewitt and others have denied this Harry was born two years before Hewitt and Diana began their affair [60] [67]\n\n\nDivorce\nThe journalist Martin Bashir interviewed Diana for the BBC current affairs show Panorama The interview was broadcast on 20 November 1995 [117] Diana discussed her own and her husband's extramarital affairs [118] Referring to Charles's relationship with Parker Bowles, she said: \"Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.\" She also expressed doubt about her husband's suitability for kingship [117] The authors Tina Brown, Sally Bedell Smith, and Sarah Bradford support Diana's admission in the interview that she had suffered from depression, bulimia and had engaged numerous times in the act of self-harm; the show's transcript records Diana confirming many of her mental health problems [117] The combination of illnesses from which Diana herself said she suffered resulted in some of her biographers opining that she had borderline personality disorder [119] [120] It was later revealed that Bashir had used forged bank statements to win Diana and her brother's trust to secure the interview, falsely indicating people close to her had been paid for spying [121] Lord Dyson conducted an independent inquiry into the issue and concluded that Bashir had \"little difficulty in playing on  [Diana's] fears and paranoia\", a sentiment that was shared by Diana's son William [122] [123]\n\n\nPost-divorce\nAfter her divorce, Diana retained the double apartment on the north side of Kensington Palace that she had shared with Charles since the first year of their marriage; the apartment remained her home until her death the following year She also moved her offices to Kensington Palace but was permitted \"to use the state apartments at St James's Palace\" [128] [142] In a book published in 2003, Paul Burrell claimed Diana's private letters had revealed that her brother, Lord Spencer, had refused to allow her to live at Althorp, despite her request [130] The allegations were proven to be untrue as Spencer received legal apologies from different newspapers, including The Times in 2021, which admitted that \"having considered his sister's safety, and in line with police advice, the Earl offered the Princess of Wales a number of properties including Wormleighton Manor, the Spencer family's original ancestral home\" [143] However, he could not offer Garden House cottage on the Althorp estate to Diana as the home was intended for a member of staff [143]\n\n\nPrincess of Wales\nFollowing her engagement to Charles, Diana made her first official public appearance in March 1981 in a charity event at Goldsmiths' Hall [172] [173] She attended the Trooping the Colour for the first time in June 1981, making her appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace afterwards In October 1981, Charles and Diana visited Wales [26] [174] She attended the State Opening of Parliament for the first time on 4 November 1981 [175] Her first solo engagement was a visit to Regent Street on 18 November 1981 to switch on the Christmas lights [176] Diana made her inaugural overseas tour in September 1982, to attend the funeral of Princess Grace of Monaco [26] Also in 1982, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands created Diana a Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown [177] In 1983, Diana accompanied Charles and William on a tour of Australia and New Zealand The tour was a success and the couple drew immense crowds, though the press focused more on Diana rather than Charles, coining the term 'Dianamania' as a reference to people's obsession with her [178] While sitting in a car with Charles near the Sydney Opera House, Diana burst into tears for a few minutes, which their office stated was due to jet lag and the heat [179] In New Zealand, the couple met with representatives of the Māori people [26] Their visit to Canada in June and July 1983 included a trip to Edmonton to open the 1983 Summer Universiade and a stop in Newfoundland to commemorate the 400th anniversary of that island's acquisition by the Crown [180] In 1983, she was targeted by the Scottish National Liberation Army who tried to deliver a letter bomb to her [181]\n\n\nCharity work and patronages\nIn 1983 Diana confided to the premier of Newfoundland, Brian Peckford, \"I am finding it very difficult to cope with the pressures of being Princess of Wales, but I am learning to cope with it\" [208] She was expected to make regular public appearances at hospitals, schools, and other facilities, in the 20th-century model of royal patronage From the mid-1980s, she became increasingly associated with numerous charities She carried out 191 official engagements in 1988 [209] and 397 in 1991 [210] Diana developed an intense interest in serious illnesses and health-related matters outside the purview of traditional royal involvement, including AIDS and leprosy In recognition of her effect as a philanthropist, Stephen Lee, director of the UK Institute of Charity Fundraising Managers, said \"Her overall effect on charity is probably more significant than any other person's in the 20th century.\" [211]\n\n\nHIV/AIDS\nDiana began her work with AIDS patients in the 1980s [236] Contrary to the prevailing stigmatization of AIDS patients, she was not averse to making physical contact with patients, [195] and was the first British royal to do so [236] In 1987, she held hands with an AIDS patient in one of her early efforts to destigmatise the condition [237] [238] Diana noted: \"HIV does not make people dangerous to know You can shake their hands and give them a hug Heaven knows they need it What's more, you can share their homes, their workplaces, and their playgrounds and toys\" [189] To Diana's disappointment, the Queen did not support this type of charity work, suggesting she get involved in \"something more pleasant\" [236] In July 1989, she opened Landmark Aids Centre in South London [239] [240] In October 1990, Diana opened Grandma's House, a home for young AIDS patients in Washington, DC [241] She was also a patron of the National AIDS Trust and regularly visited London Lighthouse, which provided residential care for HIV patients (it has since merged with the Terrence Higgins Trust) [189] [242] In 1991, she hugged one patient during a visit to the AIDS ward of the Middlesex Hospital, [189] which she had opened in 1987 as the first hospital unit dedicated to this cause in the UK [237] [243] As the patron of Turning Point, a health and social care organisation, Diana visited its project in London for people with HIV/AIDS in 1992 [244] She later established and led fundraising campaigns for AIDS research [21]\n\n\nLandmines\nDiana was patron of the HALO Trust, an organisation that removes debris—particularly landmines—left behind by war [249] [250] In January 1997, pictures of Diana touring an Angolan minefield in a ballistic helmet and flak jacket were seen worldwide [249] [250] During her campaign, she was accused of meddling in politics and called a \"loose cannon\" by Lord Howe, an official in the British Ministry of Defence [251] Despite the criticism, HALO states that Diana's efforts resulted in raising international awareness about landmines and the subsequent sufferings caused by them [249] [250] In June 1997, she gave a speech at a landmines conference held at the Royal Geographical Society, and went to Washington, DC to support the American Red Cross's anti-landmine initiative [26] From 7 to 10 August 1997, just days before her death, she visited Bosnia and Herzegovina with Jerry White and Ken Rutherford of the Landmine Survivors Network [26] [252] [253] [254]\n\n\nCancer\nFor her first solo official trip, Diana visited The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, a cancer treatment hospital in London [222] She later chose this charity to be among the organisations that benefited from the auction of her clothes in New York [222] The trust's communications manager said she did \"much to remove the stigma and taboo associated with diseases such as cancer, AIDS, HIV and leprosy\" [222] Diana became president of the hospital on 27 June 1989 [258] [259] [260] The Wolfson Children's Cancer Unit was opened by Diana on 25 February 1993 [258] In February 1996, Diana, who had been informed about a newly opened cancer hospital built by Imran Khan, travelled to Pakistan to visit its children's cancer wards and attend a fundraising dinner in aid of the charity in Lahore [261] She later visited the hospital again in May 1997 [262] In June 1996, she travelled to Chicago in her capacity as president of the Royal Marsden Hospital in order to attend a fundraising event at the Field Museum of Natural History and raised more than £1 million for cancer research [189] She additionally visited patients at the Cook County Hospital and delivered remarks at a conference on breast cancer at the Northwestern University Chicago campus after meeting a group of breast cancer researchers [263] In September 1996, after being asked by Katharine Graham, Diana went to Washington and appeared at a White House breakfast in respect of the Nina Hyde Center for Breast Cancer Research [264] She also attended an annual fund-raiser for breast cancer research organised by The Washington Post at the same centre [21] [265]\n\n\nOther areas\nIn November 1989, Diana visited a leprosy hospital in Indonesia [269] [236] Following her visit, she became patron of the Leprosy Mission, an organisation dedicated to providing medicine, treatment, and other support services to those who are afflicted with the disease She remained the patron of this charity [231] and visited several of its hospitals around the world, especially in India, Nepal, Zimbabwe and Nigeria until her death in 1997 [189] [270] She touched those affected by the disease when many people believed it could be contracted through casual contact [189] [269] \"It has always been my concern to touch people with leprosy, trying to show in a simple action that they are not reviled, nor are we repulsed\", she commented [270] The Diana Princess of Wales Health Education and Media Centre in Noida, India, was opened in her honour in November 1999, funded by the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Fund to give social support to the people affected by leprosy and disability [270]\n\n\nPrivacy and legal issues\nIn November 1980, the Sunday Mirror ran a story claiming that Charles had used the Royal Train twice for secret love rendezvous with Diana, prompting the palace to issue a statement, calling the story \"a total fabrication\" and demanding an apology [277] [278] The newspaper editors, however, insisted that the woman boarding the train was Diana and declined to apologise [277] In February 1982, pictures of a pregnant Diana in bikini while holidaying were published in the media The Queen subsequently released a statement and called it \"the blackest day in the history of British journalism.\" [279]\n\n\nDeath\nDiana died on 31 August 1997 in a car crash in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris while her driver was fleeing the paparazzi [286] The crash also resulted in the deaths of her companion Dodi Fayed and their driver, Henri Paul, who was also the acting security manager of Hôtel Ritz Paris Trevor Rees-Jones, who was employed as a bodyguard by Dodi's father, [287] survived the crash, suffering a serious head injury The televised funeral, on 6 September, was watched by a British television audience that peaked at 32.1 million, which was one of the United Kingdom's highest viewing figures ever and a United States television audience that peaked at 50 million [288] [289] The event was broadcast to over 200 countries and was seen by an estimated 2.5 billion people [290] [291]\n\n\nTribute, funeral, and burial\nThe sudden and unexpected death of an extraordinarily popular royal figure brought statements from senior figures worldwide and many tributes by members of the public [292] [293] [294] People left flowers, candles, cards, and personal messages outside Kensington Palace for many months Diana's coffin, draped with the royal flag, was brought to London from Paris by Charles and her two sisters on 31 August 1997 [295] [296] The coffin was taken to a private mortuary and then placed in the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace [295]\n\n\nConspiracy theories, inquest and verdict\nThe initial French judicial investigation concluded that the crash was caused by Paul's intoxication, reckless driving, speeding, and effects of prescription drugs [304] In February 1998, Mohamed Al-Fayed, father of Dodi Fayed, publicly said the crash, which killed his son, had been planned, [305] and accused MI6 and the Duke of Edinburgh [306] An inquest, which started in London in 2004 and continued in 2007 and 2008, [307] attributed the crash to grossly negligent driving by Paul and to the pursuing paparazzi, who forced Paul to speed into the tunnel [308] On 7 April 2008, the jury returned a verdict of \"unlawful killing\" On the day after the final verdict of the inquest, Al-Fayed announced that he would end his 10-year campaign to establish that the tragedy was murder; he said he did so for the sake of Diana's children [309]\n\n\nLater events\nFollowing her death, Diana left a £21 million estate, \"netting £17 million after estate taxes\", which were left in the hands of trustees, her mother, and her sister Sarah [310] [311] The will was signed in June 1993, but Diana had it modified in February 1996 to remove the name of her personal secretary from the list of trustees and have Sarah replace him [312] After applying personal and inheritance taxes, a net estate of £12.9 million was left to be distributed among the beneficiaries [313] Her two sons subsequently inherited the majority of her estate Each of them was left with £6.5 million which was invested and gathered substantial interest, and an estimated £10 million was given to each son upon turning 30 years old in 2012 and 2014 respectively [314] [315] Many of Diana's possessions were initially left in the care of her brother, who put them on show in Althorp twice a year until they were returned to Diana's sons [314] [310] They were also put on display in American museums and as of 2011 [update] raised two million dollars for charities [310] Among the objects were her dresses and suits along with numerous family paintings and jewels [314] Diana's engagement ring and her yellow gold watch were given to William and Harry, respectively William later passed the ring to his wife, Catherine Middleton Her wedding dress was also given to her sons [314] [316] [317]\n\n\nFinances\nFollowing her death, Diana left a £21 million estate, \"netting £17 million after estate taxes\", which were left in the hands of trustees, her mother, and her sister Sarah [310] [311] The will was signed in June 1993, but Diana had it modified in February 1996 to remove the name of her personal secretary from the list of trustees and have Sarah replace him [312] After applying personal and inheritance taxes, a net estate of £12.9 million was left to be distributed among the beneficiaries [313] Her two sons subsequently inherited the majority of her estate Each of them was left with £6.5 million which was invested and gathered substantial interest, and an estimated £10 million was given to each son upon turning 30 years old in 2012 and 2014 respectively [314] [315] Many of Diana's possessions were initially left in the care of her brother, who put them on show in Althorp twice a year until they were returned to Diana's sons [314] [310] They were also put on display in American museums and as of 2011 [update] raised two million dollars for charities [310] Among the objects were her dresses and suits along with numerous family paintings and jewels [314] Diana's engagement ring and her yellow gold watch were given to William and Harry, respectively William later passed the ring to his wife, Catherine Middleton Her wedding dress was also given to her sons [314] [316] [317]\n\n\nSubject of US government surveillance\nIn 1999, after the submission of a Freedom of Information request by the Internet news service apbonline.com, it was revealed that Diana had been placed under surveillance by the National Security Agency until her death, and the organisation kept a top secret file on her containing more than 1,000 pages [318] [319] The contents of Diana's NSA file cannot be disclosed because of national security concerns [318] The NSA officials insisted Diana was not a \"target of  [their] massive, worldwide electronic eavesdropping infrastructure.\" [318] Despite multiple inquiries for the files to be declassified—with one of the notable ones being filed by Mohamed Al-Fayed—the NSA has refused to release the documents [319]\n\n\nAnniversaries, commemorations, and auctions\nOn the first anniversary of Diana's death, people left flowers and bouquets outside the gates of Kensington Palace and a memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey [321] [322] The royal family and Tony Blair and his family went to Crathie Kirk for private prayers, while Diana's family held a private memorial service at Althorp [323] [324] All flags at Buckingham Palace and other royal residences were flown at half-mast on the Queen's orders [325] The Union Jack was first lowered to half-mast on the day of Diana's funeral and has set a precedent, as based on the previous protocol no flag could ever fly at half-mast over the palace \"even on the death of a monarch\" [325] Since 1997, however, the Union Flag (but not the Royal Standard) has flown at half-mast upon the deaths of members of the royal family, and other times of national mourning [326]\n\n\nLegacy\nDiana remains one of the most popular members of the royal family throughout history, and she continues to influence the younger generations of royals [343] [344] [345] She was a major presence on the world stage from her engagement to Charles until her death, and was often described as the \"world's most photographed woman\" [21] [346] She was noted for her compassion, style, charisma, and high-profile charity work, as well as her ill-fated marriage [347] [211] [348] Biographer Sarah Bradford commented, \"The only cure for her suffering would have been the love of the Prince of Wales .. the way in which he consistently denigrated her reduced her to despair.\" [99] Despite all the marital issues and scandals, Diana continued to enjoy a high level of popularity in the polls while her husband was suffering from low levels of public approval [21] Diana's former private secretary Patrick Jephson described her as an organised and hardworking person, and pointed out Charles was not able to \"reconcile with his wife's extraordinary popularity\", [349] a viewpoint supported by the biographer Tina Brown [350] He also said she was a tough boss who was \"equally quick to appreciate hard work\" but could also be defiant \"if she felt she had been the victim of injustice\" [349] Diana's mother also defined her as a \"loving\" figure who could occasionally be \"tempestuous\" [162] She was often described as a devoted mother to her children, [21] [351] who are believed to be influenced by her personality and way of life [352]\n\n\nPublic image\nDiana remains one of the most popular members of the royal family throughout history, and she continues to influence the younger generations of royals [343] [344] [345] She was a major presence on the world stage from her engagement to Charles until her death, and was often described as the \"world's most photographed woman\" [21] [346] She was noted for her compassion, style, charisma, and high-profile charity work, as well as her ill-fated marriage [347] [211] [348] Biographer Sarah Bradford commented, \"The only cure for her suffering would have been the love of the Prince of Wales .. the way in which he consistently denigrated her reduced her to despair.\" [99] Despite all the marital issues and scandals, Diana continued to enjoy a high level of popularity in the polls while her husband was suffering from low levels of public approval [21] Diana's former private secretary Patrick Jephson described her as an organised and hardworking person, and pointed out Charles was not able to \"reconcile with his wife's extraordinary popularity\", [349] a viewpoint supported by the biographer Tina Brown [350] He also said she was a tough boss who was \"equally quick to appreciate hard work\" but could also be defiant \"if she felt she had been the victim of injustice\" [349] Diana's mother also defined her as a \"loving\" figure who could occasionally be \"tempestuous\" [162] She was often described as a devoted mother to her children, [21] [351] who are believed to be influenced by her personality and way of life [352]\n\n\nFashion and style\nDiana was a fashion icon whose style was emulated by women around the world In 2012, Time included Diana on its All-Time 100 Fashion Icons list [376] Iain Hollingshead of The Telegraph wrote: \" [Diana] had an ability to sell clothes just by looking at them.\" [377] [378] An early example of the effect occurred during her courtship with Charles in 1980 when sales of Hunter Wellington boots skyrocketed after she was pictured wearing a pair on the Balmoral estate [377] [379] According to designers and people who worked with Diana, she used fashion and style to endorse her charitable causes, express herself and communicate [380] [381] [382] Diana remains a prominent figure for her fashion style, impacting recent cultural and style trends [383] [384] [336] [385]\n\n\nMemorials\nPermanent memorials to Diana include the Diana, Princess of

memorial to Diana [410] [411] The Place de l'Alma was renamed Place Diana princesse de Galles in 2019 [412] Following her death, several countries issued postage stamps commemorating Diana, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Somalia, and Congo [413] [414] [415] A bronze plaque was unveiled by Earl Spencer at Northampton Guildhall in 2002 as a memorial to his sister [416]\n\n\nIn popular culture and

this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nDiana Frances Spencer was born on 1 July 1961, the fourth of five children of John Spencer, Viscount Althorp (1924–1992), and Frances Spencer, Viscountess Althorp (née Roche; 1936–2004) [2] She was delivered at Park House, Sandringham, Norfolk [3] The Spencer family had been closely allied with the British royal family for several generations; [4] her grandmothers, Cynthia Spencer, Countess Spencer, and Ruth Roche, Baroness Fermoy, had served as ladies-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother [5] Her parents were hoping for a boy to carry on the family line, and no name was chosen for a week until they settled on Diana Frances after her mother and Lady Diana Spencer, a many-times-great-aunt who was also a prospective Princess of Wales as a potential bride for Frederick, Prince of Wales [6] Within the family, she was also known informally as \"Duch\", a reference to her duchess-like attitude in childhood [7]\n\n\nEducation and career\nDiana was initially home-schooled under the supervision of her governess, Gertrude Allen [21] She began her formal education at Silfield Private School in King's Lynn, Norfolk, and moved to Riddlesworth Hall School, an all-girls boarding school near Thetford, when she was nine [22] She joined her sisters at West Heath Girls' School in Sevenoaks, Kent, in 1973 [23] She did not perform well academically, failing her O-levels twice [24] [25] Her outstanding community spirit was recognised with an award from West Heath [26] She left West Heath when she was sixteen [27] Her brother Charles recalls her as being quite shy up until that time [28] She demonstrated musical ability as a skilled pianist [26] She also excelled in swimming and diving, and studied ballet and tap dance [29]\n\n\nPersonal life\nDiana first met Charles, Prince of Wales, the Queen's eldest son and heir apparent, when she was 16 in November 1977 He was then 29 and dating her older sister, Sarah [39] [40] Charles and Diana were guests at a country weekend during the summer of 1980 and he took a serious interest in her as a potential bride [41] The relationship progressed when he invited her aboard the royal yacht Britannia for a sailing weekend to Cowes This was followed by an invitation to Balmoral Castle (the royal family's Scottish residence) to meet his family [42] [43] She was well received by the Queen, the Queen Mother and the Duke of Edinburgh Charles subsequently courted Diana in London He proposed on 6 February 1981 at Windsor Castle, and she accepted, but their engagement was kept secret for two and a half weeks [38]\n\n\nEngagement and wedding\nTheir engagement became official on 24 February 1981 [21] Diana selected her own engagement ring [21] Following the engagement, she left her occupation as a nursery teacher's assistant and temporarily lived at the Queen Mother's residence, Clarence House [44] She subsequently resided at Buckingham Palace until the wedding, [44] where, according to the biographer Ingrid Seward, her life was \"incredibly lonely\" [45] Diana was the first Englishwoman to marry the first in line to the throne since Anne Hyde married James, Duke of York and Albany (later James VII and II), over 300 years earlier, and she was also the first royal bride to have a paying job before her engagement [21] [26] Diana's first public appearance with Charles was at a charity ball held at Goldsmiths' Hall in March 1981, where she was introduced to Princess Grace of Monaco [44]\n\n\nChildren\nThe couple had residences at Kensington Palace and Highgrove House, near Tetbury On 5 November 1981, Diana's pregnancy was announced [53] In January 1982—12 weeks into the pregnancy—Diana fell down a staircase at Sandringham, suffering some bruising, and the royal gynaecologist George Pinker was summoned from London; the foetus was uninjured [54] Diana later confessed that she had intentionally thrown herself down the stairs because she was feeling \"so inadequate\" [55] On 21 June 1982, she gave birth to the couple's first son, Prince William [56] She subsequently suffered from postpartum depression after her first pregnancy [57] Amidst some media criticism, she decided to take William—who was still a baby—on her first major tours of Australia and New Zealand, and the decision was popularly applauded By her own admission, Diana had not initially intended to take William until Malcolm Fraser, the Australian prime minister, made the suggestion [58]\n\n\nProblems and separation\nFive years into the marriage, the couple's incompatibility and age difference became visible and damaging [66] In 1986, Diana began a relationship with James Hewitt, the family's former riding instructor and in the same year, Charles resumed his relationship with his former girlfriend Camilla Parker Bowles The media speculated that Hewitt, not Charles, was Harry's father based on the alleged physical similarity between Hewitt and Harry, but Hewitt and others have denied this Harry was born two years before Hewitt and Diana began their affair [60] [67]\n\n\nDivorce\nThe journalist Martin Bashir interviewed Diana for the BBC current affairs show Panorama The interview was broadcast on 20 November 1995 [117] Diana discussed her own and her husband's extramarital affairs [118] Referring to Charles's relationship with Parker Bowles, she said: \"Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.\" She also expressed doubt about her husband's suitability for kingship [117] The authors Tina Brown, Sally Bedell Smith, and Sarah Bradford support Diana's admission in the interview that she had suffered from depression, bulimia and had engaged numerous times in the act of self-harm; the show's transcript records Diana confirming many of her mental health problems [117] The combination of illnesses from which Diana herself said she suffered resulted in some of her biographers opining that she had borderline personality disorder [119] [120] It was later revealed that Bashir had used forged bank statements to win Diana and her brother's trust to secure the interview, falsely indicating people close to her had been paid for spying [121] Lord Dyson conducted an independent inquiry into the issue and concluded that Bashir had \"little difficulty in playing on  [Diana's] fears and paranoia\", a sentiment that was shared by Diana's son William [122] [123]\n\n\nPost-divorce\nAfter her divorce, Diana retained the double apartment on the north side of Kensington Palace that she had shared with Charles since the first year of their marriage; the apartment remained her home until her death the following year She also moved her offices to Kensington Palace but was permitted \"to use the state apartments at St James's Palace\" [128] [142] In a book published in 2003, Paul Burrell claimed Diana's private letters had revealed that her brother, Lord Spencer, had refused to allow her to live at Althorp, despite her request [130] The allegations were proven to be untrue as Spencer received legal apologies from different newspapers, including The Times in 2021, which admitted that \"having considered his sister's safety, and in line with police advice, the Earl offered the Princess of Wales a number of properties including Wormleighton Manor, the Spencer family's original ancestral home\" [143] However, he could not offer Garden House cottage on the Althorp estate to Diana as the home was intended for a member of staff [143]\n\n\nPrincess of Wales\nFollowing her engagement to Charles, Diana made her first official public appearance in March 1981 in a charity event at Goldsmiths' Hall [172] [173] She attended the Trooping the Colour for the first time in June 1981, making her appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace afterwards In October 1981, Charles and Diana visited Wales [26] [174] She attended the State Opening of Parliament for the first time on 4 November 1981 [175] Her first solo engagement was a visit to Regent Street on 18 November 1981 to switch on the Christmas lights [176] Diana made her inaugural overseas tour in September 1982, to attend the funeral of Princess Grace of Monaco [26] Also in 1982, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands created Diana a Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown [177] In 1983, Diana accompanied Charles and William on a tour of Australia and New Zealand The tour was a success and the couple drew immense crowds, though the press focused more on Diana rather than Charles, coining the term 'Dianamania' as a reference to people's obsession with her [178] While sitting in a car with Charles near the Sydney Opera House, Diana burst into tears for a few minutes, which their office stated was due to jet lag and the heat [179] In New Zealand, the couple met with representatives of the Māori people [26] Their visit to Canada in June and July 1983 included a trip to Edmonton to open the 1983 Summer Universiade and a stop in Newfoundland to commemorate the 400th anniversary of that island's acquisition by the Crown [180] In 1983, she was targeted by the Scottish National Liberation Army who tried to deliver a letter bomb to her [181]\n\n\nCharity work and patronages\nIn 1983 Diana confided to the premier of Newfoundland, Brian Peckford, \"I am finding it very difficult to cope with the pressures of being Princess of Wales, but I am learning to cope with it\" [208] She was expected to make regular public appearances at hospitals, schools, and other facilities, in the 20th-century model of royal patronage From the mid-1980s, she became increasingly associated with numerous charities She carried out 191 official engagements in 1988 [209] and 397 in 1991 [210] Diana developed an intense interest in serious illnesses and health-related matters outside the purview of traditional royal involvement, including AIDS and leprosy In recognition of her effect as a philanthropist, Stephen Lee, director of the UK Institute of Charity Fundraising Managers, said \"Her overall effect on charity is probably more significant than any other person's in the 20th century.\" [211]\n\n\nHIV/AIDS\nDiana began her work with AIDS patients in the 1980s [236] Contrary to the prevailing stigmatization of AIDS patients, she was not averse to making physical contact with patients, [195] and was the first British royal to do so [236] In 1987, she held hands with an AIDS patient in one of her early efforts to destigmatise the condition [237] [238] Diana noted: \"HIV does not make people dangerous to know You can shake their hands and give them a hug Heaven knows they need it What's more, you can share their homes, their workplaces, and their playgrounds and toys\" [189] To Diana's disappointment, the Queen did not support this type of charity work, suggesting she get involved in \"something more pleasant\" [236] In July 1989, she opened Landmark Aids Centre in South London [239] [240] In October 1990, Diana opened Grandma's House, a home for young AIDS patients in Washington, DC [241] She was also a patron of the National AIDS Trust and regularly visited London Lighthouse, which provided residential care for HIV patients (it has since merged with the Terrence Higgins Trust) [189] [242] In 1991, she hugged one patient during a visit to the AIDS ward of the Middlesex Hospital, [189] which she had opened in 1987 as the first hospital unit dedicated to this cause in the UK [237] [243] As the patron of Turning Point, a health and social care organisation, Diana visited its project in London for people with HIV/AIDS in 1992 [244] She later established and led fundraising campaigns for AIDS research [21]\n\n\nLandmines\nDiana was patron of the HALO Trust, an organisation that removes debris—particularly landmines—left behind by war [249] [250] In January 1997, pictures of Diana touring an Angolan minefield in a ballistic helmet and flak jacket were seen worldwide [249] [250] During her campaign, she was accused of meddling in politics and called a \"loose cannon\" by Lord Howe, an official in the British Ministry of Defence [251] Despite the criticism, HALO states that Diana's efforts resulted in raising international awareness about landmines and the subsequent sufferings caused by them [249] [250] In June 1997, she gave a speech at a landmines conference held at the Royal Geographical Society, and went to Washington, DC to support the American Red Cross's anti-landmine initiative [26] From 7 to 10 August 1997, just days before her death, she visited Bosnia and Herzegovina with Jerry White and Ken Rutherford of the Landmine Survivors Network [26] [252] [253] [254]\n\n\nCancer\nFor her first solo official trip, Diana visited The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, a cancer treatment hospital in London [222] She later chose this charity to be among the organisations that benefited from the auction of her clothes in New York [222] The trust's communications manager said she did \"much to remove the stigma and taboo associated with diseases such as cancer, AIDS, HIV and leprosy\" [222] Diana became president of the hospital on 27 June 1989 [258] [259] [260] The Wolfson Children's Cancer Unit was opened by Diana on 25 February 1993 [258] In February 1996, Diana, who had been informed about a newly opened cancer hospital built by Imran Khan, travelled to Pakistan to visit its children's cancer wards and attend a fundraising dinner in aid of the charity in Lahore [261] She later visited the hospital again in May 1997 [262] In June 1996, she travelled to Chicago in her capacity as president of the Royal Marsden Hospital in order to attend a fundraising event at the Field Museum of Natural History and raised more than £1 million for cancer research [189] She additionally visited patients at the Cook County Hospital and delivered remarks at a conference on breast cancer at the Northwestern University Chicago campus after meeting a group of breast cancer researchers [263] In September 1996, after being asked by Katharine Graham, Diana went to Washington and appeared at a White House breakfast in respect of the Nina Hyde Center for Breast Cancer Research [264] She also attended an annual fund-raiser for breast cancer research organised by The Washington Post at the same centre [21] [265]\n\n\nOther areas\nIn November 1989, Diana visited a leprosy hospital in Indonesia [269] [236] Following her visit, she became patron of the Leprosy Mission, an organisation dedicated to providing medicine, treatment, and other support services to those who are afflicted with the disease She remained the patron of this charity [231] and visited several of its hospitals around the world, especially in India, Nepal, Zimbabwe and Nigeria until her death in 1997 [189] [270] She touched those affected by the disease when many people believed it could be contracted through casual contact [189] [269] \"It has always been my concern to touch people with leprosy, trying to show in a simple action that they are not reviled, nor are we repulsed\", she commented [270] The Diana Princess of Wales Health Education and Media Centre in Noida, India, was opened in her honour in November 1999, funded by the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Fund to give social support to the people affected by leprosy and disability [270]\n\n\nPrivacy and legal issues\nIn November 1980, the Sunday Mirror ran a story claiming that Charles had used the Royal Train twice for secret love rendezvous with Diana, prompting the palace to issue a statement, calling the story \"a total fabrication\" and demanding an apology [277] [278] The newspaper editors, however, insisted that the woman boarding the train was Diana and declined to apologise [277] In February 1982, pictures of a pregnant Diana in bikini while holidaying were published in the media The Queen subsequently released a statement and called it \"the blackest day in the history of British journalism.\" [279]\n\n\nDeath\nDiana died on 31 August 1997 in a car crash in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris while her driver was fleeing the paparazzi [286] The crash also resulted in the deaths of her companion Dodi Fayed and their driver, Henri Paul, who was also the acting security manager of Hôtel Ritz Paris Trevor Rees-Jones, who was employed as a bodyguard by Dodi's father, [287] survived the crash, suffering a serious head injury The televised funeral, on 6 September, was watched by a British television audience that peaked at 32.1 million, which was one of the United Kingdom's highest viewing figures ever and a United States television audience that peaked at 50 million [288] [289] The event was broadcast to over 200 countries and was seen by an estimated 2.5 billion people [290] [291]\n\n\nTribute, funeral, and burial\nThe sudden and unexpected death of an extraordinarily popular royal figure brought statements from senior figures worldwide and many tributes by members of the public [292] [293] [294] People left flowers, candles, cards, and personal messages outside Kensington Palace for many months Diana's coffin, draped with the royal flag, was brought to London from Paris by Charles and her two sisters on 31 August 1997 [295] [296] The coffin was taken to a private mortuary and then placed in the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace [295]\n\n\nConspiracy theories, inquest and verdict\nThe initial French judicial investigation concluded that the crash was caused by Paul's intoxication, reckless driving, speeding, and effects of prescription drugs [304] In February 1998, Mohamed Al-Fayed, father of Dodi Fayed, publicly said the crash, which killed his son, had been planned, [305] and accused MI6 and the Duke of Edinburgh [306] An inquest, which started in London in 2004 and continued in 2007 and 2008, [307] attributed the crash to grossly negligent driving by Paul and to the pursuing paparazzi, who forced Paul to speed into the tunnel [308] On 7 April 2008, the jury returned a verdict of \"unlawful killing\" On the day after the final verdict of the inquest, Al-Fayed announced that he would end his 10-year campaign to establish that the tragedy was murder; he said he did so for the sake of Diana's children [309]\n\n\nLater events\nFollowing her death, Diana left a £21 million estate, \"netting £17 million after estate taxes\", which were left in the hands of trustees, her mother, and her sister Sarah [310] [311] The will was signed in June 1993, but Diana had it modified in February 1996 to remove the name of her personal secretary from the list of trustees and have Sarah replace him [312] After applying personal and inheritance taxes, a net estate of £12.9 million was left to be distributed among the beneficiaries [313] Her two sons subsequently inherited the majority of her estate Each of them was left with £6.5 million which was invested and gathered substantial interest, and an estimated £10 million was given to each son upon turning 30 years old in 2012 and 2014 respectively [314] [315] Many of Diana's possessions were initially left in the care of her brother, who put them on show in Althorp twice a year until they were returned to Diana's sons [314] [310] They were also put on display in American museums and as of 2011 [update] raised two million dollars for charities [310] Among the objects were her dresses and suits along with numerous family paintings and jewels [314] Diana's engagement ring and her yellow gold watch were given to William and Harry, respectively William later passed the ring to his wife, Catherine Middleton Her wedding dress was also given to her sons [314] [316] [317]\n\n\nFinances\nFollowing her death, Diana left a £21 million estate, \"netting £17 million after estate taxes\", which were left in the hands of trustees, her mother, and her sister Sarah [310] [311] The will was signed in June 1993, but Diana had it modified in February 1996 to remove the name of her personal secretary from the list of trustees and have Sarah replace him [312] After applying personal and inheritance taxes, a net estate of £12.9 million was left to be distributed among the beneficiaries [313] Her two sons subsequently inherited the majority of her estate Each of

Diana's engagement ring and her yellow gold watch were given to William and Harry, respectively William later passed the ring to his wife, Catherine Middleton Her wedding dress was also given to her sons [314] [316] [317]\n\n\nSubject of US government surveillance\nIn 1999, after the submission of a Freedom of Information request by the Internet news service apbonline.com, it was revealed that Diana had been placed under surveillance by the National Security Agency until her death, and the organisation kept a top secret file on her containing more than 1,000 pages [318] [319] The contents of Diana's NSA file cannot be disclosed because of national security concerns [318] The NSA officials insisted Diana was not a \"target of  [their] massive, worldwide electronic eavesdropping infrastructure.\" [318] Despite multiple inquiries for the files to be declassified—with one of the notable ones being filed by Mohamed Al-Fayed—the NSA has refused to release the documents [319]\n\n\nAnniversaries, commemorations, and auctions\nOn the first anniversary of Diana's death, people left flowers and bouquets outside the gates of Kensington Palace and a memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey [321] [322] The royal family and Tony Blair and his family went to Crathie Kirk for private prayers, while Diana's family held a private memorial service at Althorp [323] [324] All flags at Buckingham Palace and other royal residences were flown at half-mast on the Queen's orders [325] The Union Jack was first lowered to half-mast on the day of Diana's funeral and has set a precedent, as based on the previous protocol no flag could ever fly at half-mast over the palace \"even on the death of a monarch\" [325] Since 1997, however, the Union Flag (but not the Royal Standard) has flown at half-mast upon the deaths of members of the royal family, and other times of national mourning [326]\n\n\nLegacy\nDiana remains one of the most popular members of the royal family throughout history, and she continues to influence the younger generations of royals [343] [344] [345] She was a major presence on the world stage from her engagement to Charles until her death, and was often described as the \"world's most photographed woman\" [21] [346] She was noted for her compassion, style, charisma, and high-profile charity work, as well as her ill-fated marriage [347] [211] [348] Biographer Sarah Bradford commented, \"The only cure for her suffering would have been the love of the Prince of Wales .. the way in which he consistently denigrated her reduced her to despair.\" [99] Despite all the marital issues and scandals, Diana continued to enjoy a high level of popularity in the polls while her husband was suffering from low levels of public approval [21] Diana's former private secretary Patrick Jephson described her as an organised and hardworking person, and pointed out Charles was not able to \"reconcile with his wife's extraordinary popularity\", [349] a viewpoint supported by the biographer Tina Brown [350] He also said she was a tough boss who was \"equally quick to appreciate hard work\" but could also be defiant \"if she felt she had been the victim of injustice\" [349] Diana's mother also defined her as a \"loving\" figure who could occasionally be \"tempestuous\" [162] She was often described as a devoted mother to her children, [21] [351] who are believed to be influenced by her personality and way of life [352]\n\n\nPublic image\nDiana remains one of the most popular members of the royal family throughout history, and she

Fashion Icons list [376] Iain Hollingshead of The Telegraph wrote: \" [Diana] had an ability to sell clothes just by looking at them.\" [377] [378] An early example of the effect occurred during her courtship with Charles in 1980 when sales of Hunter Wellington boots skyrocketed after she was pictured wearing a pair on the Balmoral estate [377] [379] According to designers and people who worked with Diana, she used fashion and style to endorse her charitable causes, express herself and communicate [380] [381] [382] Diana remains a prominent figure for her fashion style, impacting recent cultural and style trends [383] [384] [336] [385]\n\n\nMemorials\nPermanent memorials to Diana include the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain in Hyde Park, London; [404] the Diana, Princess of

Diana Memorial in the garden of Schloss Cobenzl in Vienna, making it the first memorial dedicated to Diana in a German-speaking country [409] The Flame of Liberty was erected in 1989 on the Place de l'Alma in Paris above the entrance to the tunnel in which the fatal crash later occurred It became an unofficial memorial to Diana [410] [411] The Place de l'Alma was renamed Place Diana princesse de Galles in 2019 [412] Following her death, several countries issued postage stamps commemorating Diana, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Somalia, and Congo [413] [414] [415] A bronze plaque was unveiled by Earl Spencer at Northampton Guildhall in 2002 as a memorial to his sister [416]\n\n\nIn popular culture and art\nBefore and after her death, Diana has been the subject of films and television series and depicted in contemporary art The first biopics about Diana and Charles were Charles & Diana: A Royal Love Story and The Royal Romance of Charles and Diana that were broadcast on American TV channels on 17 and 20 September 1981, respectively [423] In December 1992, ABC aired Charles and Diana: Unhappily Ever After, a TV movie about marital discord between Diana and Charles [424] Actresses

the style of \"Her Royal Highness\" [442] Though popularly referred to as \"Princess Diana\", that style is incorrect and one she never held officially [b] She is still sometimes referred to in the media as \"Lady Diana Spencer\" or colloquially as \"Lady Di\" In a speech after her death, Tony Blair referred to Diana as \"the people's princess\" [447] [448] Discussions were also held with the Spencer family and the British royal family as to whether Diana's HRH style needed to be restored posthumously, but Diana's family decided that it would be against her wishes and, thus, no formal offer was made [449]\n\n\nTitles and styles\nDiana was born with the style of \"The Honourable Diana Frances Spencer\" When her father inherited the Earldom of Spencer in 1975, she became entitled to

Oblast. It is the second-largest city in Ukraine by population after Kiev and is an important industrial, cultural, and economic center of the country.\n\n**History**\n\nThe history of Donetsk dates back to the 18th century when a mining settlement called Alexandrovka (Oleksandrivka) was established in the area. The existence of Aleksandrovskaya (Oleksandrivska) Cossack sloboda in the place is attested by 1779, with the Aleksandrovsky (Oleksandrivska) coal mine eventually being opened there. The city's development accelerated during the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the establishment of the Yuzovka Steel Plant by John Hughes, a Welsh engineer. The plant gave Donetsk its industrial history and made it a major center of heavy industry in the Donbas region.\n\n**Soviet Union**\n\nDuring the Russian Civil War, Yuzivka became a part of the Ukrainian People's Republic as per the Third Universal. It became a part of Cuman Zemlia, the administrative center of which was Bakhmut. During the First Ukrainian-Soviet War, Yuzivka was captured by the Bolshevik forces on 5 January 1918, but then recaptured by Ukraine in April. Soviet forces captured Yuzivka again during the Second Ukrainian-Soviet War. Donetsk became a part of the Donetsk-Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic from its declaration of independence on 12 February 1918. The Republic was disbanded at the 2nd All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets on 20 March 1918, when the independence of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic was declared. It failed to achieve recognition, either internationally or by the Russian SFSR, and was abolished under the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.\n\n**Independent Ukraine**\n\nAfter the declaration of independence made by the Ukrainian parliament on 24 August 1991, the 1991 Ukrainian independence referendum was held on 1 December 1991. In this referendum, 83.90% of Donetsk's voters voted in favor of independence.\n\n**Russo-Ukrainian War**\n\nAfter President Viktor Yanukovych fled Ukraine to seek asylum in Russia, Russian-backed separatists took over the Regional State Administration Building, the main government building, in Donetsk. The police did not offer resistance. Later in the week, the authorities of Donetsk disallowed a referendum on the status of the region and the police retook the Donetsk OSA building. Donetsk became one of the centers of the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine.\n\n**Geography**\n\nDonetsk lies in the steppe landscape, surrounded by scattered woodland, hills, spoil tips, rivers, and lakes. The northern outskirts are mainly used for agriculture. The Kalmius River links the city with the Sea of Azov, which is 95 km to the south, and is a popular recreational area for those living in Donetsk. A wide belt of farmlands surrounds the city.\n\n**Climate**\n\nDonetsk's climate is moderate hot summer continental (Köppen: Dfa). The average temperatures are -4.1°C in January and 21.6°C in July. The average number of rainfall per year totals 162 days, and up to 556 millimeters per year.\n\n**Government and Administrative Divisions**\n\nStarting on 7 April 2014, Donetsk was de facto governed by the Donetsk People's Republic as its capital city. The Donetsk People's Republic was at that time not recognized internationally, and all UN member states recognized the city as Ukrainian. However, in February 2022, Russia recognized the DPR and the neighboring Luhansk People's Republic as sovereign states, and later that year officially annexed them (along with various other parts of Ukraine that were then at least partially under Russian military occupation). The member states of the United Nations still overwhelmingly considered the areas to be Ukrainian, with only Syria, North Korea, and Russia itself considering them to be Russian.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nThe population of Donetsk is approximately 929,000 people. The city has a diverse population, with various ethnic and linguistic groups. The majority of the population speaks Ukrainian, while Russian and other languages are also widely spoken.\n\n**Economy**\n\nDonetsk and the surrounding territories are heavily urbanized and agglomerated into conurbation. The workforce is heavily involved with heavy industry, especially coal mining. The city is an important center of heavy industry and coal mines in the Donets Basin (Donbas). Directly under the city lie coal mines, which have recently seen an increase in mining accidents, the most recent accident being at the Zasyadko mine, which killed over 100 workers.\n\n**Sports**\n\nDonetsk is a large sports center, has a developed infrastructure, and has repeatedly held international competitions – Davis Cup, UEFA Champions League. Representatives of the city are state leaders sports such as football, hockey, basketball, boxing, tennis, athletics, and others.\n\n**Culture**\n\nFirst Line Avenue, also known as Artema Street, is considered to be the main part of Donetsk. It generally functions as the foremost place to start for any tourist trip around the city. The street hosts a mix of new and old architecture together with small parks, hotels, shopping centers, and restaurants. Noteworthy sites include Lenin Square, the Opera & Ballet Theatre, Monument to Coalminers, and Donetsk Drama Theatre.\n\n**Architecture**\n\nDonetsk, at the time Yuzovka, was divided into two parts: north and south. In the southern part were the city's factories, railway stations, telegraph buildings, hospitals, and schools. Not far from the factories was the English colony where the engineers and the management lived. After the construction of the residence of John Hughes and the various complexes for the foreign workers, the city's southern portion was constructed mainly in the English style.\n\n**Education**\n\nDonetsk has several universities, which include five state universities, 11 institutes, three academies, 14 tekhnikums, five private universities, and six colleges.\n\n**Transport**\n\nThe main forms of transport within Donetsk are: trams, electric trolley buses, buses, and marshrutkas (private minibusses).

{"title": "Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain", "content": "\nEarly life\nAnne was born at 11:39 p.m on 6 February 1665 at St James's Palace, London, the fourth child and second daughter of the Duke of York (later King James II and VII), and his first wife, Anne Hyde [1] Her father was the younger brother of King Charles II, who ruled the three kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland, and her mother was the daughter of Lord Chancellor Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon At her Anglican baptism in the Chapel Royal at St James's, her older sister, Mary, was one of her godparents, along with the Duchess of Monmouth and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Gilbert Sheldon [2] Anne's parents had eight children, but Anne and Mary were the only ones to survive into adulthood [3]\n\n\nMarriage\nIn November 1677, Anne's sister, Mary, married their Dutch first cousin William III of Orange at St James's Palace, but Anne could not attend the wedding because she was confined to her room with smallpox [16] By the time she recovered, Mary had already left for her new life in the Netherlands Lady Frances Villiers contracted the disease and died Anne's aunt Lady Henrietta Hyde (the wife of Laurence Hyde) was appointed as her new governess [17] A year later, Anne and her stepmother visited Mary in Holland for two weeks [18]\n\n\nAccession of James II\nWhen Charles II died in 1685, Anne's father became King James II of England and VII of Scotland To the consternation of the English people, James began to give Catholics military and administrative offices, in contravention of the Test Acts that were designed to prevent such appointments [34] Anne shared the general concern, and continued to attend Anglican services As her sister Mary lived in the Netherlands, Anne and her family were the only members of the royal family attending Protestant religious services in England [35] When her father tried to get Anne to baptise her youngest daughter into the Catholic faith, Anne burst into tears [36] \" [T]he doctrine of the Church of Rome is wicked and dangerous\", she wrote to her sister, \"their ceremonies—most of them—plain downright idolatry.\" [37] Anne became estranged from her father and stepmother, as James moved to weaken the Church of England's power [38]\n\n\nGlorious Revolution\nWilliam of Orange invaded England on 5 November 1688 in an action known as the Glorious Revolution, which ultimately deposed King James Forbidden by James to pay Mary a projected visit in the spring of 1687, [50] Anne corresponded with her and was aware of the plans to invade [51] On the advice of the Churchills, [46] she refused to side with James after William landed and instead wrote to William on 18 November declaring her approval of his action [52] Churchill abandoned the unpopular King James on the 24th George followed suit that night, [53] and in the evening of the following day James issued orders to place Sarah Churchill under house arrest at St James's Palace [54] Anne and Sarah fled from Whitehall by a back staircase, putting themselves under the care of Bishop Compton They spent one night in his house, and subsequently arrived at Nottingham on 1 December [55] Two weeks later and escorted by a large company, Anne arrived at Oxford, where she met George in triumph [56] \"God help me!\", lamented James on discovering Anne's desertion on 26 November, \"Even my children have forsaken me.\" [57] On 19 December, Anne returned to London, where she was at once visited by William James fled to France on the 23rd [58] Anne showed no concern at the news of her father's flight, and instead merely asked for her usual game of cards She justified herself by saying that she \"was used to play and never loved to do anything that looked like an affected constraint\" [59]\n\n\nWilliam and Mary\nSoon after their accession, William and Mary rewarded John Churchill by granting him the Earldom of Marlborough and George was made Duke of Cumberland Anne requested the use of Richmond Palace and a parliamentary allowance William and Mary refused the first, and unsuccessfully opposed the latter, both of which caused tension between the two sisters [63] Anne's resentment grew worse when William refused to allow George to serve in the military in an active capacity [64] The new king and queen feared that Anne's financial independence would weaken their influence over her and allow her to organise a rival political faction [65] From around this time, [66] at Anne's request she and Sarah Churchill, Lady Marlborough, began to call each other the pet names Mrs Morley and Mrs Freeman, respectively, to facilitate a relationship of greater equality between the two when they were alone [67] In January 1692, suspecting that Marlborough was secretly conspiring with James's followers, the Jacobites, William and Mary dismissed him from all his offices In a public show of support for the Marlboroughs, Anne took Sarah to a social event at the palace, and refused her sister's request to dismiss Sarah from her household [68] Lady Marlborough was subsequently removed from the royal household by the Lord Chamberlain, and Anne angrily left her royal lodgings and took up residence at Syon House, the home of the Duke of Somerset [69] Anne was stripped of her guard of honour; courtiers were forbidden to visit her, and civic authorities were instructed to ignore her [70] In April, Anne gave birth to a son who died within minutes Mary visited her, but instead of offering comfort took the opportunity to berate Anne once again for her friendship with Sarah The sisters never saw each other again [71] Later that year, Anne moved to Berkeley House in Piccadilly, London, where she had a stillborn daughter in March 1693 [72]\n\n\nAct of Settlement\nAnne's final pregnancy ended on 25 January 1700 with a stillbirth She had been pregnant at least 17 times over as many years, and had miscarried or given birth to stillborn children at least 12 times Of her five liveborn children, four died before the age of two [80] Anne experienced bouts of \"gout\" (pains in her limbs and eventually stomach and head) from at least 1698 [81] Based on her foetal losses and physical symptoms, she may have had systemic lupus erythematosus, [82] or antiphospholipid syndrome [83] Alternatively, pelvic inflammatory disease could explain why the onset of her symptoms roughly coincided with her penultimate pregnancy [82] [84] Other suggested causes of her failed pregnancies are listeriosis, [85] diabetes, intrauterine growth retardation, and rhesus incompatibility [86] Rhesus incompatibility, however, generally worsens with successive pregnancies, and so does not fit the pattern of Anne's pregnancies, as her only son to survive infancy, Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, was born after a series of stillbirths [87] Experts also believe syphilis, porphyria and pelvic deformation to be unlikely as the symptoms are incompatible with her medical history [82] [88]\n\n\nReign\nAnne became queen upon the death of King William III on 8 March 1702, and was immediately popular [98] In her first speech to the English Parliament, on 11 March, she distanced herself from her late Dutch brother-in-law and said, \"As I know my heart to be entirely English, I can very sincerely assure you there is not anything you can expect or desire from me which I shall not be ready to do for the happiness and prosperity of England.\" [99]\n\n\nActs of Union\nWhile Ireland was subordinate to the English Crown and Wales formed part of the kingdom of England, Scotland remained an independent sovereign state with its own parliament and laws The Act of Settlement 1701, passed by the English Parliament, applied in the kingdoms of England and Ireland but not Scotland, where a strong minority wished to preserve the Stuart dynasty and its right of inheritance to the throne [110] Anne had declared it \"very necessary\" to conclude a union of England and Scotland in her first speech to the English Parliament, [111] and a joint Anglo-Scots commission met at her former residence, the Cockpit, to discuss terms in October 1702 The negotiations broke up in early February 1703 having failed to reach an agreement [112] [113] The Estates of Scotland responded to the Act of Settlement by passing the Act of Security, which gave the Estates the power, if the Queen had no further children, to choose the next Scottish monarch from among the Protestant descendants of the royal line of Scotland [114] The individual chosen by the Estates could not be the same person who came to the English throne, unless England granted full freedom of trade to Scottish merchants [115] At first, Anne withheld royal assent to the act, but she granted it the following year when the Estates threatened to withhold supply, endangering Scottish support for England's wars [116]\n\n\nTwo-party politics\nAnne's reign was marked by the further development of a two-party system In general, the Tories were supportive of the Anglican church and favoured the landed interest of the country gentry, while the Whigs were aligned with commercial interests and Protestant Dissenters As a committed Anglican, Anne was inclined to favour the Tories [124] Her first ministry was predominantly Tory, and contained such High Tories as Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham, and her uncle Laurence Hyde, 1st Earl of Rochester [125] It was headed by Lord Treasurer Lord Godolphin and Anne's favourite the Duke of Marlborough, who were considered moderate Tories, along with the Speaker of the House of Commons, Robert Harley [126]\n\n\nDeath of Prince George\nAnne was devastated by Prince George's death in October 1708, [160] and it proved a turning point in her relationship with the Duchess of Marlborough The Duchess arrived at Kensington Palace shortly before George died, and after his death insisted that Anne leave Kensington for St James's Palace against her wishes [161] Anne resented the Duchess's intrusive actions, which included removing a portrait of George from the Queen's bedchamber and then refusing to return it in the belief that it was natural \"to avoid seeing of papers or anything that belonged to one that one loved when they were just dead\" [162]\n\n\nWar of the Spanish Succession\nAs the expensive War of the Spanish Succession grew unpopular, so did the Whig administration [167] The impeachment of Henry Sacheverell, a high church Tory Anglican who had preached anti-Whig sermons, led to further public discontent Anne thought Sacheverell ought to be punished for questioning the Glorious Revolution, but that his punishment should only be a mild one to prevent further public commotion [168] In London, riots broke out in support of Sacheverell, but the only troops available to quell the disturbances were Anne's guards, and Secretary of State Sunderland was reluctant to use them and leave the Queen less protected Anne declared God would be her guard and ordered Sunderland to redeploy her troops [169] In line with Anne's views, Sacheverell was convicted, but his sentence—suspension of preaching for three years—was so light as to render the trial a mockery [169]\n\n\nDeath\nAnne was unable to walk between January and July 1713 [187] At Christmas, she was feverish, and lay unconscious for hours, [188] leading to rumours of her impending death [189] She recovered, but was seriously ill again in March [190] By July, Anne had lost confidence in Harley; his secretary recorded that Anne told the cabinet \"that he neglected all business; that he was seldom to be understood; that when he did explain himself, she could not depend upon the truth of what he said; that he never came to her at the time she appointed; that he often came drunk;  [and] last, to crown all, he behaved himself towards her with ill manner, indecency and disrespect.\" [191] On 27 July 1714, during Parliament's summer recess, she dismissed Harley as Lord Treasurer [192] Despite failing health, which her doctors blamed on the emotional strain of matters of state, she attended two late-night cabinet meetings that failed to determine Harley's successor A third meeting was cancelled when she became too ill to attend [193] She was rendered unable to speak by a stroke on 30 July 1714, the anniversary of Gloucester's death, and on the advice of the Privy Council handed the treasurer's staff of office to Whig grandee Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury [194]\n\n\nSuccession\nThe Electress Sophia had died on 28 May, [c] two months before Anne, so the Electress's son, George, Elector of Hanover, succeeded pursuant to the Act of Settlement 1701 The possible Catholic claimants, including Anne's half-brother, James Francis Edward Stuart, were ignored The Elector's accession was relatively stable: a Jacobite rising in 1715 failed [198] Marlborough was reinstated, [199] and the Tory ministers were replaced by Whigs [200]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe Duchess of Marlborough \"unduly disparaged\" Anne in her memoirs, [46] and her prejudiced recollections persuaded many early biographers that Anne was \"a weak, irresolute woman beset by bedchamber quarrels and deciding high policy on the basis of personalities\" [202] The Duchess wrote of Anne:\n\n\nTitles, styles, honours and arms\nThe official style of Anne before 1707 was \"Anne, by the Grace of God, Queen of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.\" After the union, her style was \"Anne, by the Grace of God, Queen of Great Britain, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.\" [218] In line with other monarchs of England between 1340 and 1800, Anne was styled \"Queen of France\", but did not actually reign in

(for Scotland); III, Azure, a harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland) In 1702, Anne adopted the motto semper eadem (\"always the same\"), the same motto used by Queen Elizabeth I [220]\nThe Acts of Union declared that: \"the Ensigns Armorial of the said United Kingdom be such as Her Majesty shall appoint\" [221] In 1707, the union was heraldically expressed by the impalement, or placing side by

"# Anne, Queen of Great Britain\n\nAnne was born at 11:39 p.m on 6 February 1665 at St James's Palace, London, the fourth child and second daughter of the Duke of York (later King James II and VII), and his first wife, Anne Hyde. Her father was the younger brother of King Charles II, who ruled the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and her mother was the daughter of Lord Chancellor Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon.\n\n## Early Life\n\nAnne's Anglican baptism in the Chapel Royal at St James's was attended by her older sister, Mary, as one of her godparents, alongside the Duchess of Monmouth and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Gilbert Sheldon. Anne's parents had eight children, but Anne and Mary were the only ones to survive into adulthood. In November 1677, Anne's sister, Mary, married their Dutch first cousin William III of Orange at St James's Palace, but Anne could not attend the wedding due to illness.\n\n## Marriage\n\nBy the time Anne recovered, Mary had already left for her new life in the Netherlands. Lady Frances Villiers contracted the disease and died, and Anne's aunt Lady Henrietta Hyde (the wife of Laurence Hyde) was appointed as her new governess. A year later, Anne and her stepmother visited Mary in Holland for two weeks. When Charles II died in 1685, Anne's father became King James II of England and VII of Scotland.\n\n## Accession of James II\n\nTo the consternation of the English people, James began to give Catholics military and administrative offices, in contravention of the Test Acts that were designed to prevent such appointments. Anne shared the general concern and continued to attend Anglican services. When her father tried to get Anne to baptise her youngest daughter into the Catholic faith, Anne burst into tears. She became estranged from her father and stepmother as James moved to weaken the Church of England's power.\n\n## Glorious Revolution\n\nWilliam of Orange invaded England on 5 November 1688 in an action known as the Glorious Revolution, which ultimately deposed King James. Forbidden by James to pay Mary a projected visit in the spring of 1687, Anne corresponded with her and was aware of the plans to invade. On the advice of the Churchills, she refused to side with James after William landed and instead wrote to William on 18 November declaring her approval of his action.\n\n## William and Mary\n\nSoon after their accession, William and Mary rewarded John Churchill by granting him the Earldom of Marlborough and George was made Duke of Cumberland. Anne requested the use of Richmond Palace and a parliamentary allowance, but William and Mary refused the first and unsuccessfully opposed the latter, both of which caused tension between the two sisters. Anne's resentment grew worse when William refused to allow George to serve in the military in an active capacity.\n\n## Act of Settlement\n\nWhile Ireland was subordinate to the English Crown and Wales formed part of the kingdom of England, Scotland remained an independent sovereign state with its own parliament and laws. The Act of Settlement 1701, passed by the English Parliament, applied in the kingdoms of England and Ireland but not Scotland, where a strong minority wished to preserve the Stuart dynasty and its right of inheritance to the throne.\n\n## Two-party politics\n\nAnne's reign was marked by the further development of a two-party system. In general, the Tories were supportive of the Anglican church and favoured the landed interest of the country gentry, while the Whigs were aligned with commercial interests and Protestant Dissenters. As a committed Anglican, Anne was inclined to favour the Tories.\n\n## Death of Prince George\n\nAnne was devastated by Prince George's death in October 1708, and it proved a turning point in her relationship with the Duchess of Marlborough. The Duchess arrived at Kensington Palace shortly before George died, and after his death insisted that Anne leave Kensington for St James's Palace against her wishes.\n\n## War of the Spanish Succession\n\nAs the expensive War of the Spanish Succession grew unpopular, so did the Whig administration. The impeachment of Henry Sacheverell, a high church Tory Anglican who had preached anti-Whig sermons, led to further public discontent. Anne thought Sacheverell ought to be punished for questioning the Glorious Revolution, but that his punishment should only be a mild one to prevent further public commotion.\n\n## Reign\n\nAnne became queen upon the death of King William III on 8 March 1702, and was immediately popular. In her first speech to the English Parliament, on 11 March, she distanced herself from her late Dutch brother-in-law and said, \"As I know my heart to be entirely English, I can very sincerely assure you there is not anything you can expect or desire from me which I shall not be ready to do for the happiness and prosperity of England.\"\n\n## Succession\n\nThe Electress Sophia had died on 28 May, two months before Anne, so the Electress's son, George, Elector of Hanover, succeeded pursuant to the Act of Settlement 1701. The possible Catholic claimants, including Anne's half-brother, James Francis Edward Stuart, were ignored. The Elector's accession was relatively stable: a Jacobite rising in 1715 failed, and Marlborough was reinstated, and the Tory ministers were replaced by Whigs.\n\n## Legacy\n\nThe Duchess of Marlborough \"unduly disparaged\" Anne in her memoirs, and her prejudiced recollections persuaded many early biographers that Anne was \"a weak, irresolute woman beset by bedchamber quarrels and deciding high policy on the basis of personalities.\" The Duchess wrote of Anne: \"She was a perfect frost, to whom the warmth of friendship and the kindness of humanity were utterly unknown.\"\n\n## Titles, styles, honours and arms\n\nThe official style of Anne before 1707 was \"Anne, by the Grace of God, Queen of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.\" After the union, her style was \"Anne, by the Grace of God, Queen of Great Britain, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.\" In line with other monarchs of England between 1340 and 1800, Anne was styled \"Queen of France\", but did not actually reign in France.\n\n## Arms\n\nAs queen regnant, Anne's coat of arms before the union were the Stuart royal arms, in use since 1603: Quarterly; I and IV grandquarterly, Azure three fleurs-de-lis Or (for France) and Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England); II, Or, a lion rampant within a double tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); III, Azure, a harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland).

of the Duke of York (later King James II and VII), and his first wife, Anne Hyde [1] Her father was the younger brother of King Charles II, who ruled the three kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland, and her mother was the daughter of Lord Chancellor Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon At her Anglican baptism in the Chapel Royal at St James's, her older sister, Mary, was one of her godparents, along with the Duchess of Monmouth and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Gilbert Sheldon [2] Anne's parents had eight children, but Anne and Mary were the only ones to survive into adulthood [3]\n\n\nMarriage\nIn November 1677, Anne's sister, Mary, married their Dutch first cousin William III of Orange at St James's Palace, but Anne could not attend the wedding because she was confined to her room with smallpox [16] By the time she recovered, Mary had already left for her new life in the Netherlands Lady Frances Villiers contracted the disease and died Anne's aunt Lady Henrietta Hyde (the wife of Laurence Hyde) was appointed as her new governess [17] A year later, Anne and her stepmother visited Mary in Holland for two weeks [18]\n\n\nAccession of James II\nWhen Charles II died in 1685, Anne's father became King James II of England and VII of Scotland To the consternation of the English people, James began to give Catholics military and administrative offices, in contravention of the Test Acts that were designed to prevent such appointments [34] Anne shared the general concern, and continued to attend Anglican services As her sister Mary lived in the Netherlands, Anne and her family were the only members of the royal family attending Protestant religious services in England [35] When her father tried to get Anne to baptise her youngest daughter into the Catholic faith, Anne burst into tears [36] \" [T]he doctrine of the Church of Rome is wicked and dangerous\", she wrote to her sister, \"their ceremonies—most of them—plain downright idolatry.\" [37] Anne became estranged from her father and stepmother, as James moved to weaken the Church of England's power [38]\n\n\nGlorious Revolution\nWilliam of Orange invaded England on 5 November 1688 in an action known as the Glorious Revolution, which ultimately deposed King James Forbidden by James to pay Mary a projected visit in the spring of 1687, [50] Anne corresponded with her and was aware of the plans to invade [51] On the advice of the Churchills, [46] she refused to side with James after William landed and instead wrote to William on 18 November declaring her approval of his action [52] Churchill abandoned the unpopular King James on the 24th George followed suit that night, [53] and in the evening of the following day James issued orders to place Sarah Churchill under house arrest at St James's Palace [54] Anne and Sarah fled from Whitehall by a back staircase, putting themselves under the care of Bishop Compton They spent one night in his house, and subsequently arrived at Nottingham on 1 December [55] Two weeks later and escorted by a large company, Anne arrived at Oxford, where she met George in triumph [56] \"God help me!\", lamented James on discovering Anne's desertion on 26 November, \"Even my children have forsaken me.\" [57] On 19 December, Anne returned to London, where she was at once visited by William James fled to France on the 23rd [58] Anne showed no concern at the news of her father's flight, and instead merely asked for her usual game of cards She justified herself by saying that she \"was used to play and never loved to do anything that looked like an affected constraint\" [59]\n\n\nWilliam and Mary\nSoon after their accession, William and Mary rewarded John Churchill by granting him the Earldom of Marlborough and George was made Duke of Cumberland Anne requested the use of Richmond Palace and a parliamentary allowance William and Mary refused the first, and unsuccessfully opposed the latter, both of which caused tension between the two sisters [63] Anne's resentment grew worse when William refused to allow George to serve in the military in an active capacity [64] The new king and queen feared that Anne's financial independence would weaken their influence over her and allow her to organise a rival political faction [65] From around this time, [66] at Anne's request she and Sarah Churchill, Lady Marlborough, began to call each other the pet names Mrs Morley and Mrs Freeman, respectively, to facilitate a relationship of greater equality between the two when they were alone [67] In January 1692, suspecting that Marlborough was secretly conspiring with James's followers, the Jacobites, William and Mary dismissed him from all his offices In a public show of support for the Marlboroughs, Anne took Sarah to a social event at the palace, and refused her sister's request to dismiss Sarah from her household [68] Lady Marlborough was subsequently removed from the royal household by the Lord Chamberlain, and Anne angrily left her royal lodgings and took up residence at Syon House, the home of the Duke of Somerset [69] Anne was stripped of her guard of honour; courtiers were forbidden to visit her, and civic authorities were instructed to ignore her [70] In April, Anne gave birth to a son who died within minutes Mary visited her, but instead of offering comfort took the opportunity to berate Anne once again for her friendship with Sarah The sisters never saw each other again [71] Later that year, Anne moved to Berkeley House in Piccadilly, London, where she had a stillborn daughter in March 1693 [72]\n\n\nAct of Settlement\nAnne's final pregnancy ended on 25 January 1700 with a stillbirth She had been pregnant at least 17 times over as many years, and had miscarried or given birth to stillborn children at least 12 times Of her five liveborn children, four died before the age of two [80] Anne experienced bouts of \"gout\" (pains in her limbs and eventually stomach and head) from at least 1698 [81] Based on her foetal losses and physical symptoms, she may have had systemic lupus erythematosus, [82] or antiphospholipid syndrome [83] Alternatively, pelvic inflammatory disease could explain why the onset of her symptoms roughly coincided with her penultimate pregnancy [82] [84] Other suggested causes of her failed pregnancies are listeriosis, [85] diabetes, intrauterine growth retardation, and rhesus incompatibility [86] Rhesus incompatibility, however, generally worsens with successive pregnancies, and so does not fit the pattern of Anne's pregnancies, as her only son to survive infancy, Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, was born after a series of stillbirths [87] Experts also believe syphilis, porphyria and pelvic deformation to be unlikely as the symptoms are incompatible with her medical history [82] [88]\n\n\nReign\nAnne became queen upon the death of King William III on 8 March 1702, and was immediately popular [98] In her first speech to the English Parliament, on 11 March, she distanced herself from her late Dutch brother-in-law and said, \"As I know my heart to be entirely English, I can very sincerely assure you there is not anything you can expect or desire from me which I shall not be ready to do for the happiness and prosperity of England.\" [99]\n\n\nActs of Union\nWhile Ireland was subordinate to the English Crown and Wales formed part of the kingdom of England, Scotland remained an independent sovereign state with its own parliament and laws The Act of Settlement 1701, passed by the English Parliament, applied in the kingdoms of England and Ireland but not Scotland, where a strong minority wished to preserve the Stuart dynasty and its right of inheritance to the throne [110] Anne had declared it \"very necessary\" to conclude a union of England and Scotland in her first speech to the English Parliament, [111] and a joint Anglo-Scots commission met at her former residence, the Cockpit, to discuss terms in October 1702 The negotiations broke up in early February 1703 having failed to reach an agreement [112] [113] The Estates of Scotland responded to the Act of Settlement by passing the Act of Security, which gave the Estates the power, if the Queen had no further children, to choose the next Scottish monarch from among the Protestant descendants of the royal line of Scotland [114] The individual chosen by the Estates could not be the same person who came to the English throne, unless England granted full freedom of trade to Scottish merchants [115] At first, Anne withheld royal assent to the act, but she granted it the following year when the Estates threatened to withhold supply, endangering Scottish support for England's wars [116]\n\n\nTwo-party politics\nAnne's reign was marked by the further development of a two-party system In general, the Tories were supportive of the Anglican church and favoured the landed interest of the country gentry, while the Whigs were aligned with commercial interests and Protestant Dissenters As a committed Anglican, Anne was inclined to favour the Tories [124] Her first ministry was predominantly Tory, and contained such High Tories as Daniel Finch, 2nd

However, it is believed that he was a slave or an attendant from Ethiopia or another part of Africa who was brought to Japan in the 16th century.

He was a prominent figure in the country's politics, known for his efforts to promote economic development and improve living conditions for Haitians.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nJovenel Moïse was born on June 26, 1968, in Trou du Nord, Nord-Est, Haiti. At a young age, his family relocated to Port-au-Prince, where he pursued his primary education at the École Nationale Don Durélin. He later continued his secondary education at Lycée Toussaint Louverture and Centre Culturel du Collège Canado-Haïtien.\n\n**Business Career**\n\nMoïse began his business career by founding Jomar Auto Parts. The following year, he started working on an agricultural project involving organic banana production from a plantation covering over 10 hectares in the Nord-Ouest department. In 2001, he collaborated with Culligan Water to build a drinking water plant for the Nord-Ouest and Nord-Est departments.\n\n**Political Career**\n\nIn 2015, President Michel Martelly designated Moïse as the presidential candidate of the Haitian Tèt Kale Party (PHTK), a center-right political party he had founded. During his campaign, Moïse promoted bio-ecological agriculture as an economic engine for Haiti, whose population was over 50% rural.\n\n**Presidency**\n\nAs President, Moïse implemented several initiatives to improve Haiti's infrastructure and economy. He built the second-largest hydropower plant and agricultural water reservoir in Haiti after Peligue. He also constructed the \"Barrage Marion\" in Marion, Haiti, which provides electricity and water to farmers in Northern Haiti. Additionally, he rebuilt the \"Barrage la Tannerie\" to increase agricultural production in that area. Furthermore, he built several water pumping stations using solar power for the same purpose.\n\nMoïse was also involved in various other infrastructure projects, including building numerous roads in towns like Jeremie and Port-de-Paix. He rebuilt and upgraded the airport in Jérémie and constructed power plants to provide electricity to many small towns.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nDuring his presidency, Moïse faced several allegations of corruption, including taking bribes for road-building projects and short-selling a contract to sell goats to the Haitian government. These allegations, coupled with a declining quality of life for Haitian citizens throughout his administration, led to mass protests demanding his resignation. He was also accused of using gangs to attack his political rivals and burning their personal property.\n\n**Electoral History**\n\nPresidential elections were held in Haiti on October 25, 2015, alongside local elections and the second round of the legislative elections. As no candidate received more than 50% of the vote, a second round was mandated by law. However, this was repeatedly postponed, and eventually canceled, with an interim president appointed indirectly by the legislature in the February 2016 Haitian presidential election and fresh elections scheduled for 2016.\n\nIn November 2016, Moïse was elected in the first round with more than 50% of votes cast.\n\n**Assassination**\n\nOn July 7, 2021, Moïse was shot dead when gunmen attacked his residence in Pèlerin 5, a district of Pétion-Ville around 1 a.m. Martine Moïse, the first lady of Haiti, was airlifted to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami to be treated for wounds she sustained during the attack.

it then moved to the larger Stage 9 for the remainder of its production [21]  Despite numerous establishing shots taken in New York City, [22] all scenes of the actors walking in New York were also filmed at CBS Studio Center, on their New York Street backlot [23] Street scenes and park scenes were filmed in the CBS Studio Centre's New York Street and Central Park backlots, respectively [24]\n\n\nSeries overview\nMany Seinfeld episodes are based on the writers' real-life experiences, with the experiences reinterpreted for the characters' storylines For example, George's storyline in \"The Revenge\" is based on Larry David's experience at Saturday Night Live [30] \"The Contest\" is also based on David's experiences \"The Smelly Car\" storyline is based on Peter Mehlman's lawyer friend, who could not get a bad smell out of his car \"The Strike\" is based on Dan O'Keefe's dad, who made up his own holiday: Festivus [31] Other stories take a variety of turns \"The Chinese Restaurant\" consists of George, Jerry, and Elaine waiting for a table throughout the entire episode [32] \"The Boyfriend\", revolving around Keith Hernandez, extends through two episodes \"The Betrayal\" is famous for using reverse chronology and was inspired by a similar plot device in a Harold Pinter play, Betrayal [33] Some stories were inspired by headlines and rumors, as explained in the DVD features \"Notes About Nothing\", \"Inside Look\" and \"Audio Commentary.\" In \"The Maestro,\" Kramer's lawsuit is roughly similar to the McDonald's coffee case [34] \"The Outing\" is based primarily on rumors that Larry Charles heard about Jerry Seinfeld's sexuality [35]\n\n\nPlotlines\nMany Seinfeld episodes are based on the writers' real-life experiences, with the experiences reinterpreted for the characters' storylines For example, George's storyline in \"The Revenge\" is based on Larry David's experience at Saturday Night Live [30] \"The Contest\" is also based on David's experiences \"The Smelly Car\" storyline is based on Peter Mehlman's lawyer friend, who could not get a bad smell out of his car \"The Strike\" is based on Dan O'Keefe's dad, who made up his own holiday: Festivus [31] Other stories take a variety of turns \"The Chinese Restaurant\" consists of George, Jerry, and Elaine waiting for a table throughout the entire episode [32] \"The Boyfriend\", revolving around Keith Hernandez, extends through two episodes \"The Betrayal\" is famous for using reverse chronology and was inspired by a similar plot device in a Harold Pinter play, Betrayal [33] Some stories were inspired by headlines and rumors, as explained in the DVD features \"Notes About Nothing\", \"Inside Look\" and \"Audio Commentary.\" In \"The Maestro,\" Kramer's lawsuit is roughly similar to the McDonald's coffee case [34] \"The Outing\" is based primarily on rumors that Larry Charles heard about Jerry Seinfeld's sexuality [35]\n\n\nThemes\nThe series was often described as \"a show about nothing.\" [1] [36] However, in 2014, Seinfeld stated: \"The pitch for the show, the real pitch, when Larry and I went to NBC in 1988, was  [that] we want to show how a comedian gets his material The show \"about nothing\" was just a joke in an episode many years later, and Larry and I to this day are surprised that it caught on as a way that people describe the show because, to us, it's the opposite of that.\" [37] David similarly commented: \"I like taking the worst qualities that a person has and trying to make something funny out of it Doesn't everybody do terrible things and have terrible thoughts? Just by trying to be as funny, you're going to deal with a lot of things that are real, so the show's really about something The whole thing about the show being about nothing is ridiculous.\" [38]\n\n\nCatchphrases\nMany terms were coined, popularized, or re-popularized in the series' run and have become part of popular culture, [49] including \"Yada, yada, yada\", [50] \"No soup for you!\", \"Master of my domain\", and \"Not that there's anything wrong with that.\" The lexicon of Seinfeldian code words and recurring phrases that evolved around particular episodes is referred to as Seinlanguage, which is also the title of Jerry Seinfeld's best-selling book on humor [47] These terms include \"man hands\", \"shrinkage\", \"regift\", and \"double dip\".\n\n\nConsumer products\nA recurring feature of Seinfeld was its inclusion of specific products, especially candy, as plot points These might be a central feature of a plot (e.g., Junior Mints, Twix, Chuckles, Jujyfruits, bite-size Three Musketeers, Snickers, Chunky, Oh Henry!, Drake's Coffee Cake and PEZ), or an association of candy with a guest character (e.g Oh Henry! bars) or simply a conversational aside (e.g., Chuckles, Clark Bar, Twinkies) A large number of non-candy products were also featured throughout the series.\n\n\nMusic\nA signature of Seinfeld is its theme music Composed by Jonathan Wolff, it consists of distinct solo sampled electric bass riffs that open the show and connect the scenes, often accompanied by beatboxing [52] The bass music eventually replaced the original piano/synth music by Jep Epstein when it was played again after the first broadcast of the pilot episode The show lacked a traditional title track and the riffs were played over the first moments of dialogue or action They vary throughout each episode and are played in an improvised funk style, matching the timing of Seinfeld's stand-up comedy delivery or transitions in the editing An additional musical theme with an ensemble, led by a synthesized mid-range brass instrument, ends each episode.\n\n\nCast and characters\nMany characters have made multiple appearances, notably Jerry's parents, Morty and Helen

related by family or work-associated connections but remain distinctly close friends throughout the series Many characters were based primarily on Seinfeld's and David's real-life acquaintances Two prominent recurring characters were fictional depictions of actual well-known people: Jacopo Peterman of the J Peterman catalog (based on John Peterman) [67] and George Steinbrenner, owner of the New York Yankees [68] Many characters were introduced as new writers got involved with Seinfeld Other characters based on real people include the Soup Nazi [69] and Jackie Chiles, who was based on Johnnie Cochran [70]\n\n\nSeasons 1–3\nThe show premiered as The Seinfeld Chronicles on July 5, 1989 After it aired, a pickup by NBC seemed unlikely, and the show was offered to Fox, which declined to pick it up Rick Ludwin, head of late night and special events for NBC, however, diverted money from his budget by canceling a Bob Hope television special, and the next four episodes were filmed [74] [75] These episodes were highly rated as they followed summer re-runs of Cheers on Thursdays at 9:30 p.m., and the series was finally picked up At one point, NBC considered airing these episodes on Saturdays at 10:30 p.m but gave the slot to a short-lived sitcom called FM instead The series was renamed simply Seinfeld as a precautionary measure due to the failure of the short-lived 1990 ABC series with a similarly sounding title, The Marshall Chronicles [76] After airing the remaining four episodes of its first season the summer of 1990, NBC ordered 13 more episodes   David believed that he and Seinfeld had no more stories to tell and advised Seinfeld to turn down the order, but Seinfeld agreed to the additional episodes [75] Season 2 was bumped off its scheduled premiere of January 16, 1991, due to the outbreak of the Persian Gulf War It settled into a regular time slot on Wednesdays at 9:30 p.m and eventually flipped with veteran series Night Court to 9 p.m [77]\n\n\nSeasons 4–5\nSeason 4 marked the sitcom's entry into the Nielsen ratings Top 30 It contains several of the most popular episodes, such as \"The Bubble Boy\" in which George and the bubble boy argue over Trivial Pursuit, [84] and \"The Junior Mint\" in which Jerry and Kramer accidentally fumble a mint in the operating room [85] This was the first season to use a story arc of Jerry and George creating their own sitcom, Jerry Also, at this time, the use of Jerry's stand-up act slowly declined, and the stand-up segment in the middle of Seinfeld episodes was cut.\n\n\nSeasons 6–7\nIn Season 6, Andy Ackerman replaced Tom Cherones as director of the show The series remained well regarded and produced some of its most famous episodes, such as \"The Beard\", in which Jerry is put through a lie detector test to make him admit that he watched Melrose Place; [91] \"The Switch\", in which Kramer's mom, Babs, reveals that his first name is Cosmo; [92] and \"The Understudy\", in which Elaine meets J Peterman for the first time [93] Story arcs used in this season were Elaine working as a personal assistant to her eccentric boss Justin Pitt and George's parents' temporary separation This was the first season in which Seinfeld reached No 1 in the Nielsen Ratings The use of Jerry's stand-up act declined, and the end stand-up segment no longer appeared because the storylines for all four characters grew denser.\n\n\nSeasons 8–9\nSeinfeld's final two seasons were considered distinct from the earlier seasons Most noticeably, David left the writing crew (but returned to write \"The Finale\" in 1998), resulting in Seinfeld taking over David's duties as showrunner, and, under the direction of a new writing staff, Seinfeld became a faster-paced show The show no longer contained extracts of Jerry performing stand-up comedy—Jerry had no time or energy for this with his new responsibilities—and storylines occasionally delved into fantasy and broad humor For example, in \"The Bizarro Jerry\", Elaine is torn between exact opposites of her friends and Jerry dates a woman who has the now-famous \"man hands\" [96] Some notable episodes from Season 8 include \"The Little Kicks\" showing Elaine's horrible dancing, [97] and \"The Chicken Roaster\" which portrays the Kenny Rogers Roasters chicken restaurant which opened during that time [98] A story arc in this season involves Peterman going to Burma in \"The Foundation\" [99] until he recovered from a nervous breakdown in \"The Money\", [100] followed by Elaine writing Peterman's biography in \"The Van Buren Boys\", [101] which leads to Kramer's parody of Kenny Kramer's Reality Tour seen in \"The Muffin Tops\" [102]\n\n\nSeries finale\nAfter nine years on the air, NBC and Seinfeld announced on December 25, 1997, that the series would end production the following spring in 1998 The announcement made the front page of the major New York newspapers, including The New York Times [109] Seinfeld was featured on the cover of Time magazine's first issue of 1998 [110] The series ended with a 75-minute episode (cut to 60 minutes in syndication, in two parts) written by co-creator and ex-executive producer Larry David, which aired on May 14, 1998 Before the finale, a 45-minute retrospective clip show, \"The Chronicle,\" was aired The retrospective was expanded to an hour after the original airing and aired again on NBC as an hour-long episode, and has since aired in syndication.\n\n\nReception and legacy\nElizabeth Magnotta and Alexandra Strohl analyze the success of Seinfeld with recourse to the incongruity theory of humor: \"The Incongruity Theory claims that humor is created out of a violation of an expectation For humor to result from this unexpected result, the event must have an appropriate emotional climate, comprised of the setting, characters, prior discourse, relationships of the characters, and the topic.\" [121] Specifically, Magnotta and Strohl focus on \"The Marine Biologist\", where George is embroiled in yet another lie, and on \"The Red Dot,\" where George tries to save a few dollars at Elaine's expense by giving her a marked-down cashmere sweater.\n\n\nU.S. television ratings\nSeinfeld has received awards and nominations in various categories throughout the mid-1990s It was awarded the Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series in 1993, Golden Globe Award for Best TV Series (Comedy) in 1994, and Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series in 1995, 1997 and 1998 [138] [139] [140] Apart from these,

syndication and cable syndication [188] As of February 2017 [update] the show had made an estimated $4.06 billion in syndication Steve Bannon, who invested in the show, later said, \"We calculated what it would get us if it made it to syndication We were wrong by a factor of five\" [189] In September 2019, it was announced that Viacom (now Paramount Global) had acquired cable syndication rights to the series from TBS, with it airing on Comedy Central beginning in October 2021, Nick at Nite from May 31, 2022, until November 12, 2022, and TV Land since February 11, 2023 [190] [191]\n\n\nHigh-definition versions\nThere are two high-definition versions of Seinfeld The first is that of the network TV (non-syndicated) versions in the original aspect ratio of 4:3 that were downscaled for the DVD releases Clips from this high-definition version in its upscale were seen on NBC during The Seinfeld Story special [192] Syndicated broadcast stations and the cable networks TBS and Comedy Central (and also Fox) began airing the syndicated version of Seinfeld in HD Unlike the version used for the DVD, Sony Pictures cropped the top and bottom parts of the frame while restoring

within the first season This gave rise to the term Seinfeld curse: the failure of a sitcom starring one of the three, despite the conventional wisdom that each person's Seinfeld popularity should almost guarantee a strong, built-in audience for the actor's new show Shows specifically cited regarding the Seinfeld curse are Julia Louis-Dreyfus's Watching Ellie, Jason Alexander's Bob Patterson and Listen Up, and Michael Richards' The Michael Richards Show This phenomenon was mentioned throughout the second season of Larry David's HBO program Curb Your Enthusiasm, which aired in 2001 In real life, David has repeatedly dismissed the idea of a curse, saying, \"It's so completely idiotic It's very hard to have a successful sitcom.\" [198] [199]\n\n\nCurb Your Enthusiasm\nEarly in March 2009, it was announced that the Seinfeld cast would reunite for season seven of Curb Your Enthusiasm [204] The cast first appeared in the third episode of the season, all playing fictional versions of themselves The season-long story is that Larry David tries to initiate a Seinfeld reunion show as a ploy to win back his ex-wife, Cheryl Along with the four main characters, some Seinfeld supporting actors like Wayne Knight, Estelle Harris and Steve Hytner appeared in the ninth episode at a table read for the reunion show Although much dialogue in Curb Your Enthusiasm is improvised, the plot was scripted, and the Seinfeld special that aired within the show was scripted and directed by Seinfeld regular Andy Ackerman, making this the first time since Seinfeld went off the air that the central cast appeared together in a scripted show.\n\n\nComedians in Cars Getting Coffee\nJerry Seinfeld, Jason Alexander, and Wayne Knight, playing their respective Seinfeld characters, appeared in a spot presented during halftime of Super Bowl XLVIII on February 2, 2014 [205] Fox came up with the idea of doing such a spot, due in part to the Super Bowl's location being New York City adjacent that year [205] An uncut version appeared on Crackle.com immediately afterward, as an episode of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee titled \"The Over-Cheer,\" establishing Seinfeld's character on the series as an older version of his Seinfeld character [205] Although the spot was used to advertise Seinfeld's web series, it was not considered a commercial, as Sony, which produces the series, did not pay for it [205] While Seinfeld indicated that the webisode would probably be the last cast reunion, saying, \"I have a feeling you've seen the final coda on that very unique experience,\"  [206] since then, Michael Richards and Julia Louis-Dreyfus have also appeared in episodes.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nGeneral references\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Seinfeld**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSeinfeld is an American sitcom that was created by Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld. The show is often described as \"a show about nothing,\" but it is actually a comedy that explores the mundane aspects of everyday life through the experiences of a group of friends living in New York City. The show premiered in 1989 and ran for nine seasons, becoming one of the most popular and influential television shows of all time.\n\n**Production**\n\nSeinfeld began as a 23-minute pilot titled \"The Seinfeld Chronicles,\" which was created by Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, developed by NBC executive Rick Ludwin, and produced by Castle Rock Entertainment. The pilot was a mix of Seinfeld's stand-up comedy routines and idiosyncratic, conversational scenes focusing on mundane aspects of everyday life. The pilot first aired on July 5, 1989, and finished second in its time slot against the CBS police drama \"Jake and the Fatman,\" receiving a Nielsen rating of 10.9/19.\n\n**Conception**\n\nSeinfeld began as a 23-minute pilot titled \"The Seinfeld Chronicles,\" which was created by Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, developed by NBC executive Rick Ludwin, and produced by Castle Rock Entertainment. The pilot was a mix of Seinfeld's stand-up comedy routines and idiosyncratic, conversational scenes focusing on mundane aspects of everyday life like laundry, the buttoning of the top button on one's shirt, and the effort by men to interpret the intent of women spending the night in Seinfeld's apartment.\n\n**First Seasons**\n\nWhen NBC announced its 1989-90 (primetime) schedule in May 1989, \"The Seinfeld Chronicles\" was not included, but the show's supporters did not give up. The pilot first aired on July 5, 1989, and finished second in its time slot against the CBS police drama \"Jake and the Fatman,\" receiving a Nielsen rating of 10.9/19. The ratings did not exhibit the regional skew predicted by NBC executive Brandon Tartikoff, much to the encouragement of the show's supporters. Ludwin canceled one of the Bob Hope specials budgeted for that season so the entertainment division had the money to order four more episodes of \"The Seinfeld Chronicles,\" which formed the rest of the show's first season (the series was by then retitled to \"Seinfeld\"). Although this was a very low order number for a new series—and the smallest sitcom order in TV history—Castle Rock failed to find any other buyers when it shopped the show to other networks, and accepted the order.\n\n**Seasons 1-3**\n\nThe show premiered as \"The Seinfeld Chronicles\" on July 5, 1989. After it aired, a pickup by NBC seemed unlikely, and the show was offered to Fox, which declined to pick it up.

While Seinfeld indicated that the webisode would probably be the last cast reunion, saying, \"I have a feeling you've seen the final coda on that very unique experience,\" since then, Michael Richards and Julia Louis-Dreyfus have also appeared in episodes.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Seinfeld\" following this outline:\n\n\nProduction\nSeinfeld began as a 23-minute pilot titled \"The Seinfeld Chronicles\" Created by Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, developed by NBC executive Rick Ludwin, and produced by Castle Rock Entertainment, it was a mix of Seinfeld's stand-up comedy routines and idiosyncratic, conversational scenes focusing on mundane aspects of everyday life like laundry, the buttoning of the top button on one's shirt, and the effort by men to interpret the intent of women spending the night in Seinfeld's apartment [12]\n\n\nConception\nSeinfeld began as a 23-minute pilot titled \"The Seinfeld Chronicles\" Created by Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, developed by NBC executive Rick Ludwin, and produced by Castle Rock Entertainment, it was a mix of Seinfeld's stand-up comedy routines and idiosyncratic, conversational scenes focusing on mundane aspects of everyday life like laundry, the buttoning of the top button on one's shirt, and the effort by men to interpret the intent of women spending the night in Seinfeld's apartment [12]\n\n\nFirst seasons\nWhen NBC announced its 1989–90 (primetime) schedule in May 1989, The Seinfeld Chronicles was not included, but the show's supporters did not give up The pilot first aired on July 5, 1989, and finished second in its time slot against the CBS police drama Jake and the Fatman, [12] receiving a Nielsen rating of 10.9/19 [14] The ratings did not exhibit the regional skew Tartikoff predicted, much to the encouragement of the show's supporters Ludwin canceled one of the Bob Hope specials budgeted for that season so the entertainment division had the money to order four more episodes of The Seinfeld Chronicles, which formed the rest of the show's first season (the series was by then retitled to Seinfeld) [12] [17]—a move without which Chicago Tribune columnist Phil Rosenthal later said there \"would be no Seinfeld\" [18] Although this was a very low order number for a new series—and the smallest sitcom order in TV history [14]—Castle Rock failed to find any other buyers when it shopped the show to other networks, and accepted the order [12] Seinfeld did not return to the airwaves until May 30, 1990, and it was another three years before it became a Top 5-rated show Preston Beckman, in charge of NBC's research department at the time, reminisced, \"The show was different Nobody had seen anything like it It wasn't unusual for poor-testing shows to get on the air, but it was very rare that they became hits.\"\n\n\nFilming\nOther than the pilot, the series was filmed at CBS Studio Center in Studio City, Los Angeles The first three seasons were filmed on Soundstage 19; it then moved to the larger Stage 9 for the remainder of its production [21]  Despite numerous establishing shots taken in New York City, [22] all scenes of the actors walking in New York were also filmed at CBS Studio Center, on their New York Street backlot [23] Street scenes and park scenes were filmed in the CBS Studio Centre's New York Street and Central Park backlots, respectively [24]\n\n\nSeries overview\nMany Seinfeld episodes are based on the writers' real-life experiences, with the experiences reinterpreted for the characters' storylines For example, George's storyline in \"The Revenge\" is based on Larry David's experience at Saturday Night Live [30] \"The Contest\" is also based on David's experiences \"The Smelly Car\" storyline is based on Peter Mehlman's lawyer friend, who could not get a bad smell out of his car \"The Strike\" is based on Dan O'Keefe's dad, who made up his own holiday: Festivus [31] Other stories take a variety of turns \"The Chinese Restaurant\" consists of George, Jerry, and Elaine waiting for a table throughout the entire episode [32] \"The Boyfriend\", revolving around Keith Hernandez, extends through two episodes \"The Betrayal\" is famous for using reverse chronology and was inspired by a similar plot device in a Harold Pinter play, Betrayal [33] Some stories were inspired by headlines and rumors, as explained in the DVD features \"Notes About Nothing\", \"Inside Look\" and \"Audio Commentary.\" In \"The Maestro,\" Kramer's lawsuit is roughly similar to the McDonald's coffee case [34] \"The Outing\" is based primarily on rumors that Larry Charles heard about Jerry Seinfeld's sexuality [35]\n\n\nPlotlines\nMany Seinfeld episodes are based on the writers' real-life experiences, with the experiences reinterpreted for the characters' storylines For example, George's storyline in \"The Revenge\" is based on Larry David's experience at Saturday Night Live [30] \"The Contest\" is also based on David's experiences \"The Smelly Car\" storyline is based on Peter Mehlman's lawyer friend, who could not get a bad smell out of his car \"The Strike\" is based on Dan O'Keefe's dad, who made up his own holiday: Festivus [31] Other stories take a variety of turns \"The Chinese Restaurant\" consists of George, Jerry, and Elaine waiting for a table throughout the entire episode [32] \"The Boyfriend\", revolving around Keith Hernandez, extends through two episodes \"The Betrayal\" is famous for using reverse chronology and was inspired by a similar plot device in a Harold Pinter play, Betrayal [33] Some stories were inspired by headlines and rumors, as explained in the DVD features \"Notes About Nothing\", \"Inside Look\" and \"Audio Commentary.\" In \"The Maestro,\" Kramer's lawsuit is roughly similar to the McDonald's coffee case [34] \"The Outing\" is based primarily on rumors that Larry Charles heard about Jerry Seinfeld's sexuality [35]\n\n\nThemes\nThe series was often described as \"a show about nothing.\" [1] [36] However, in 2014, Seinfeld stated: \"The pitch for the show, the real pitch, when Larry and I went to NBC in 1988, was  [that] we want to show how a comedian gets his material The show \"about nothing\" was just a joke in an episode many years later, and Larry and I to this day are surprised that it caught on as a way that people describe the show because, to us, it's the opposite of that.\" [37] David similarly commented: \"I like taking the worst qualities that a person has and trying to make something funny out of it Doesn't everybody do terrible things and have terrible thoughts? Just by trying to be as funny, you're going to deal with a lot of things that are real, so the show's really about something The whole thing about the show being about nothing is ridiculous.\" [38]\n\n\nCatchphrases\nMany terms were coined, popularized, or re-popularized in the series' run and have become part of popular culture, [49] including \"Yada, yada, yada\", [50] \"No soup for you!\", \"Master of my domain\", and \"Not that there's anything wrong with that.\" The lexicon of Seinfeldian code words and recurring phrases that evolved around particular episodes is referred to as Seinlanguage, which is also the title of Jerry Seinfeld's best-selling book on humor [47] These terms include \"man hands\", \"shrinkage\", \"regift\", and \"double dip\".\n\n\nConsumer products\nA recurring feature of Seinfeld was its inclusion of specific products, especially candy, as plot points These might be a central feature of a plot (e.g., Junior Mints, Twix, Chuckles, Jujyfruits, bite-size Three Musketeers, Snickers, Chunky, Oh Henry!, Drake's Coffee Cake and PEZ), or an association of candy with a guest character (e.g Oh Henry! bars) or simply a conversational aside (e.g., Chuckles, Clark Bar, Twinkies) A large number of non-candy products were also featured throughout the series.\n\n\nMusic\nA signature of Seinfeld is its theme music Composed by Jonathan Wolff, it consists of distinct solo sampled electric bass riffs that open the show and connect the scenes, often accompanied by beatboxing [52] The bass music eventually replaced the original piano/synth music by Jep Epstein when it was played again after the first broadcast of the pilot episode The show lacked a traditional title track and the riffs were played over the first moments of dialogue or action They vary throughout each episode and are played in an improvised funk style, matching the timing of Seinfeld's stand-up comedy delivery or transitions in the editing An additional musical theme with an ensemble, led by a synthesized mid-range brass instrument, ends each episode.\n\n\nCast and characters\nMany characters have made multiple appearances, notably Jerry's parents, Morty and Helen Seinfeld, who reside in Florida; George's parents, the overbearing Frank and Estelle Costanza; George's on-again, off-again fiancée Susan Ross; Jerry's Uncle Leo; Elaine's variety of bosses, Mr Lippman, Mr Pitt and J Peterman; Elaine's on-again, off-again boyfriend David Puddy; and Kramer's friend, Newman, a mail carrier who lives in the same building and is Jerry's nemesis In addition to recurring characters, Seinfeld features numerous celebrities who appear as themselves or as girlfriends, boyfriends, bosses, and other acquaintances.\n\n\nMain characters\nMany characters have made

themselves or as girlfriends, boyfriends, bosses, and other acquaintances.\n\n\nEpisodes\nCompared to other family and group sitcoms of the era, Seinfeld stood out The principal characters are not related by family or work-associated connections but remain distinctly close friends throughout the series Many characters were based primarily on Seinfeld's and David's real-life acquaintances Two prominent recurring characters were fictional depictions of actual well-known people: Jacopo Peterman of the J Peterman catalog (based on John Peterman) [67] and George Steinbrenner, owner of the New York Yankees [68] Many characters were introduced as new writers got involved with Seinfeld Other characters based on real people include the Soup Nazi [69] and Jackie Chiles, who was based on Johnnie Cochran [70]\n\n\nSeasons 1–3\nThe show premiered as The Seinfeld Chronicles on July 5, 1989 After it aired, a pickup by NBC seemed unlikely, and the show was offered to Fox, which declined to pick it up Rick Ludwin, head of late night and special events for NBC, however, diverted money from his budget by canceling a Bob Hope television special, and the next four episodes were filmed [74] [75] These episodes were highly rated as they followed summer re-runs of Cheers on Thursdays at 9:30 p.m., and the series was finally picked up At one point, NBC considered airing these episodes on Saturdays at 10:30 p.m but gave the slot to a short-lived sitcom called FM instead The series was renamed simply Seinfeld as a precautionary measure due to the failure of the short-lived 1990 ABC series with a similarly sounding title, The Marshall Chronicles [76] After airing the remaining four episodes of its first season the summer of 1990, NBC ordered 13 more episodes   David believed that he and Seinfeld had no more stories to tell and advised Seinfeld to turn down the order, but Seinfeld agreed to the additional episodes [75] Season 2 was bumped off its scheduled premiere of January 16, 1991, due to the outbreak of the Persian Gulf War It settled into a regular time slot on Wednesdays at 9:30 p.m and eventually flipped with veteran series Night Court to 9 p.m [77]\n\n\nSeasons 4–5\nSeason 4 marked the sitcom's entry into the Nielsen ratings Top 30 It contains several of the most popular episodes, such as \"The Bubble Boy\" in which George and the bubble boy argue over Trivial Pursuit, [84] and \"The Junior Mint\" in which Jerry and Kramer accidentally fumble a mint in the operating room [85] This was the first season to use a story arc of Jerry and George creating their own sitcom, Jerry Also, at this time, the use of Jerry's stand-up act slowly declined, and the stand-up segment in the middle of Seinfeld episodes was cut.\n\n\nSeasons 6–7\nIn Season 6, Andy Ackerman replaced Tom Cherones as director of the show The series remained well regarded and produced some of its most famous episodes, such as \"The Beard\", in which Jerry is put through a lie detector test to make him admit that he watched Melrose Place; [91] \"The Switch\", in which Kramer's mom, Babs, reveals that his first name is Cosmo; [92] and \"The Understudy\", in which Elaine meets J Peterman for the first time [93] Story arcs used in this season were Elaine working as a personal assistant to her eccentric boss Justin Pitt and George's parents' temporary separation This was the first season in which Seinfeld reached No 1 in the Nielsen Ratings The use of Jerry's stand-up act declined, and the end stand-up segment no longer appeared because the storylines for all four characters grew denser.\n\n\nSeasons 8–9\nSeinfeld's final two seasons were considered distinct from the earlier seasons Most noticeably, David left the writing crew (but returned to write \"The Finale\" in 1998), resulting in Seinfeld taking over David's duties as showrunner, and, under the direction of a new writing staff, Seinfeld became a faster-paced show The show no longer contained extracts of Jerry performing stand-up comedy—Jerry had no time or energy for this with his new responsibilities—and storylines occasionally delved into fantasy and broad humor For example, in \"The Bizarro Jerry\", Elaine is torn between exact opposites of her friends and Jerry dates a woman who has the now-famous \"man hands\" [96] Some notable episodes from Season 8 include \"The Little Kicks\" showing Elaine's horrible dancing, [97] and \"The Chicken Roaster\" which portrays the Kenny Rogers Roasters chicken restaurant which opened during that time [98] A story arc in this season involves Peterman going to Burma in \"The Foundation\" [99] until he recovered from a nervous breakdown in \"The Money\", [100] followed by Elaine writing Peterman's biography in \"The Van Buren Boys\", [101] which leads to Kramer's parody of Kenny Kramer's Reality Tour seen in \"The Muffin Tops\" [102]\n\n\nSeries finale\nAfter nine years on the air, NBC and Seinfeld announced on December 25, 1997, that the series would end production the following spring in 1998 The announcement made the front page of the major New York newspapers, including The New York Times [109] Seinfeld was featured on the cover of Time magazine's first issue of 1998 [110] The series ended with a 75-minute episode (cut to 60 minutes in syndication, in two parts) written by co-creator and ex-executive producer Larry David, which aired on May 14, 1998 Before the finale, a 45-minute retrospective clip show, \"The Chronicle,\" was aired The retrospective was expanded to an hour after the original airing and aired again on NBC as an hour-long episode, and has since aired in syndication.\n\n\nReception and legacy\nElizabeth Magnotta and Alexandra Strohl analyze the success of Seinfeld with recourse to the incongruity theory of humor: \"The Incongruity Theory claims that humor is created out of a violation of an expectation For humor to result from this unexpected result, the event must have an appropriate emotional climate, comprised of the setting, characters, prior discourse, relationships of the characters, and the topic.\" [121] Specifically, Magnotta and Strohl focus on \"The Marine Biologist\", where George is embroiled in yet another lie, and on \"The Red Dot,\" where George tries to save a few dollars at Elaine's expense by giving her a marked-down cashmere sweater.\n\n\nU.S. television ratings\nSeinfeld has received awards and nominations in various categories throughout the mid-1990s It was awarded the Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series in 1993, Golden Globe Award for Best TV Series (Comedy) in 1994, and Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series in 1995, 1997 and 1998 [138] [139] [140] Apart from these,

\"The Highlights of 100\" became the first Seinfeld episode available on home video when it was released on VHS in 1995 by food company General Mills Sony Pictures Home Entertainment (formerly Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment) released all nine seasons of Seinfeld on DVD in Regions 1, 2, and 4 between 2004 and 2007 [163] On November 6, 2007, Seinfeld: The Complete Series was released on DVD The complete series box set includes a 2007 \"roundtable\" reunion of the four main cast members and Larry David; only highlights of this were also included in the Season 9 set.\n\n\nSyndication\nAccording to Barry Meyer, chairman of Warner Bros Entertainment (parent company of Castle Rock Entertainment), Seinfeld made $2.7 billion through June 2010 through off-network syndication and cable syndication [188] As of February 2017 [update] the show had made an estimated $4.06 billion in syndication Steve Bannon, who invested in the show, later said, \"We calculated what it would get us if it made it to syndication We were wrong by a factor of five\" [189] In September 2019, it was announced that Viacom (now Paramount Global) had acquired cable syndication rights to the series from TBS, with it airing on Comedy Central beginning in October 2021, Nick at Nite from May 31, 2022, until November 12, 2022, and TV Land since February 11, 2023 [190] [191]\n\n\nHigh-definition versions\nThere are two high-definition versions of Seinfeld The first is that of the network TV (non-syndicated) versions in the original aspect ratio of 4:3 that were downscaled for the DVD releases Clips from this high-definition version in its upscale were seen on NBC during The Seinfeld Story special [192] Syndicated broadcast stations and the cable networks TBS and Comedy Central (and also Fox) began airing the syndicated version of Seinfeld in HD Unlike the version used for the DVD, Sony Pictures cropped the top and bottom parts of the frame while restoring previously cropped images on the sides from the 35mm film source to use the entire 16:9 frame [193]\n\n\nAfter Seinfeld\nOn the November 1, 2007, episode of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, Jerry Seinfeld mentioned the possibility of shooting one last scene after the characters leave jail He mentioned that he was too busy to do it at the time, but did not announce what the scene would entail, as its production is not a certainty [194] In a commentary from the final season DVD, Seinfeld outlines that he and Jason Alexander spoke about this scene being in Monk's Cafe, with George saying \"That was brutal\" about the foursome's stint in prison [195]\n\n\nAnother scene\nOn the November 1, 2007, episode of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, Jerry Seinfeld mentioned the possibility of

stint in prison [195]\n\n\nThe Seinfeld \"curse\"\nLouis-Dreyfus, Alexander, and Richards have all tried to launch new sitcoms as title-role characters Almost every show was canceled quickly, usually within the first season This gave rise to the term Seinfeld curse: the failure of a sitcom starring one of the three, despite the conventional wisdom that each person's Seinfeld popularity should almost guarantee a strong, built-in audience for the actor's new show Shows specifically cited regarding the Seinfeld curse are Julia Louis-Dreyfus's Watching Ellie, Jason Alexander's Bob Patterson and Listen Up, and Michael Richards' The Michael Richards Show This phenomenon was mentioned throughout the second season of Larry David's HBO program Curb Your Enthusiasm, which aired in 2001 In real life, David has repeatedly dismissed the idea of a curse, saying, \"It's so completely idiotic It's very hard to have a successful sitcom.\" [198] [199]\n\n\nCurb Your Enthusiasm\nEarly in March 2009, it was announced that the Seinfeld cast would reunite for season seven of Curb Your Enthusiasm [204] The cast first appeared in the third episode of the season, all playing fictional versions of themselves The season-long story is that Larry David tries to initiate a Seinfeld reunion show as a ploy to win back his ex-wife, Cheryl Along with the four main characters, some Seinfeld supporting actors like Wayne Knight, Estelle Harris and Steve Hytner appeared in the ninth episode at a table read for the reunion show Although much dialogue in Curb Your Enthusiasm is improvised, the plot was scripted, and the Seinfeld special that aired within the show was scripted and directed by Seinfeld regular Andy Ackerman, making this the first time since Seinfeld went off the air that the central cast appeared together in a scripted show.\n\n\nComedians in Cars Getting Coffee\nJerry Seinfeld, Jason Alexander, and Wayne Knight, playing their respective Seinfeld characters, appeared in a spot presented during halftime of Super Bowl XLVIII on February 2, 2014 [205] Fox came up with the idea of doing such a spot, due in part to the Super Bowl's location being New York City adjacent that year [205] An uncut version appeared on Crackle.com immediately afterward, as an episode of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee titled \"The Over-Cheer,\" establishing Seinfeld's character on the series as an
