He was born in the late 6th century BCE and lived in Ephesus, a city in ancient Ionia. Heraclitus is considered one of the most important philosophers of the ancient Greek world, and his ideas have had a profound impact on Western philosophy.\n\n**Life**\n\nLittle is known about Heraclitus' life, and his biography is shrouded in mystery. He was born around 535 BCE in Ephesus, a city in ancient Ionia, which is now part of modern-day Turkey. Heraclitus was a member of the noble class, and his family was known for their wealth and influence. He was educated in Greek literature, philosophy, and science, and he was deeply interested in the natural world. Heraclitus was known for his eccentric behavior, and he was often referred to as the \"weeping philosopher\" due to his melancholy demeanor.\n\n**On Nature**\n\nHeraclitus' most famous work is his book \"On Nature,\" which is a collection of philosophical fragments that explore the nature of the universe. The book is a product of his philosophical and scientific observations, and it is considered one of the most important works of ancient Greek philosophy.\n\n### Structure\n\nThe \"On Nature\" is a collection of 130 fragments that are divided into several sections. The book begins with a discussion of the nature of reality, which Heraclitus describes as a complex and dynamic system. He argues that the universe is in a constant state of flux, and that everything is interconnected and interdependent.\n\n### Style\n\nHeraclitus' style is characterized by his use of paradoxes, contradictions, and enigmatic statements. He often uses metaphors and imagery to convey complex ideas, and his language is often opaque and difficult to understand.\n\n### The Obscure\n\nHeraclitus was known for his obscurity, and his language is often cryptic and difficult to decipher. He often uses phrases and sentences that are open to multiple interpretations, and his meaning is often unclear or ambiguous. This has led some scholars to argue that Heraclitus was a deliberate obscurantist, who intended to convey complex ideas in a way that was deliberately difficult to understand.\n\n**Philosophy**\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy is centered on the idea that everything is in a state of flux and that nothing is permanent. He argues that the universe is a complex and dynamic system, in which everything is interconnected and interdependent.

He argues that day and night, hot and cold, and life and death are all part of a single, interconnected system.

This idea is often referred to as the \"flux doctrine,\" and it has had a profound impact on Western philosophy.\n\n### You cannot step into the same river twice\n\nHeraclitus' most famous statement is \"you cannot step into the same river twice.\" This statement is often used to illustrate the idea that everything is in a state of flux, and that nothing remains the same. Heraclitus argues that the river is constantly changing, and that even the water molecules are different from one moment to the next.\n\n### Strife is justice\n\nHeraclitus argues that strife is a fundamental aspect of the universe, and that it is necessary for the maintenance of justice. He argues that the natural order of the universe is one of conflict and competition, and that this is necessary for the survival and prosperity of living beings.\n\n**Logos**\n\nHeraclitus' concept of \"logos\" is central to his philosophy.

Heraclitus' concept of logos has had a profound impact on Western philosophy, and it has influenced thinkers such as Plato and Aristotle.\n\n**Fire**\n\nHeraclitus often uses fire as a metaphor for the nature of reality.

He argues that the sun is a fiery essence that permeates the universe, and that it is the source of all order and harmony.\n\n### Moon\n\nHeraclitus argues that the moon is a reflection of the sun, and that it is a symbol of the feminine principle. He argues that the moon is a lunar essence that is connected to the natural world, and that it is a source of fertility and abundance.\n\n**God**\n\nHeraclitus argues that the universe is a complex and dynamic system, and that it is governed by a rational principle. He argues that this principle is the source of all order and harmony, and that it is the ultimate reality.

The protests were a significant expression of public discontent and frustration with the government's handling of the pandemic, and marked a rare moment of open dissent in China.\n\nBackground\n\n### COVID-19 Lockdowns in China\n\nChina's COVID-19 lockdown policies had been in place since 2020, with the government imposing strict restrictions on movement and gathering to prevent the spread of the virus. However, as the pandemic dragged on, the lockdowns became increasingly severe and widespread, with entire cities and neighborhoods being locked down for extended periods. The policies were widely criticized for their economic and social impact, with many people losing their livelihoods and facing significant hardship.\n\n### Democracy Movements in China\n\nThe 2022 COVID-19 protests were not the first expression of public discontent in China. In recent years, there have been several democracy movements and protests in the country, often sparked by issues such as corruption, human rights abuses, and economic inequality.

The protest was sparked by a proposal to build a high-speed rail line through the city, which many residents believed would destroy their homes and communities.

The storm formed over the Atlantic Ocean and strengthened into a hurricane as it moved westward, bringing heavy rain and strong winds to several islands and coastal areas.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nHurricane Idalia formed on August 15, 2023, as a tropical depression in the Atlantic Ocean, approximately 1,000 miles (1,600 km) east of the Lesser Antilles. At the time, the system was characterized by a low-pressure area with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph (45 km/h) and a central pressure of 1010 mbar.

The incident resulted in the loss of all five crew members on board.\n\n**Background**\n\n### OceanGate\n\nOceanGate Inc. is a company that specializes in deep-sea exploration and tourism. The company was founded in 2009 and has since become a leading player in the field of manned submersible operations. OceanGate has developed a range of submersibles, including the Titan, which is designed for deep-sea exploration and tourism.\n\n### Titanic\n\nThe Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning of April 15, 1912, after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. The ship's wreckage was discovered on September 1, 1985, by a team of oceanographers led by Robert Ballard. The wreck of the Titanic is located at a depth of approximately 12,500 feet (3,800 meters) in the North Atlantic Ocean.\n\n**Submersible Titan**\n\n### Dives to wreck of Titanic\n\nThe Titan submersible is a deep-sea vessel designed for manned exploration of the ocean floor. The submersible is capable of reaching depths of up to 36,000 feet (10,973 meters) and has a maximum operating time of 24 hours. OceanGate has used the Titan on several occasions to dive to the wreck of the Titanic, providing tourists and researchers with a unique opportunity to explore the wreck site.\n\n### Safety\n\nThe Titan submersible is equipped with a range of safety features, including a robust hull design, a fully redundant life support system, and a state-of-the-art communication system. The submersible is also equipped with a backup power system and a emergency beacon that can be activated in the event of an emergency.\n\n### Prior concerns\n\nThere had been concerns raised about the safety of the Titan submersible prior to the incident. In 2022, the company's founder, Stockton Rush, was involved in a near-fatal accident while piloting the Titan. Rush suffered serious injuries, including a broken back and a punctured lung, and was forced to undergo emergency surgery.\n\n### Previous incidents\n\nThere had been several previous incidents involving the Titan submersible, including a 2020 incident in which the submersible was damaged during a dive to the wreck of the Titanic. The incident resulted in a delay of several weeks in the planned expedition.\n\n**Incident**\n\n### Expedition arrangements\n\nThe Titan submersible was scheduled to embark on a four-day expedition to the wreck of the Titanic on June 18, 2023, with a crew of five on board. The expedition was part of a larger project to explore the wreck site and gather data on the ship's condition.\n\n### 16–17 June preparations\n\nOn June 16 and 17, 2023, the crew of the Titan submersible prepared for the expedition by conducting a series of safety checks and emergency drills. The crew also conducted a final briefing on the expedition plan and the expected risks associated with the dive.\n\n### 18 June, dive, disappearance, and implosion\n\nOn June 18, 2023, the Titan submersible descended to the wreck of the Titanic at a depth of approximately 12,500 feet (3,800 meters). The submersible was scheduled to spend several hours exploring the wreck site, but it failed to return to the surface. Contact was lost with the submersible at approximately 8:45 am local time, and a search and rescue operation was launched immediately.\n\n### 18–22 June, search and rescue efforts\n\nThe search and rescue operation was conducted by a team of experts from the U.S. Navy, the Canadian Coast Guard, and other agencies. The operation involved the use of sonar and other underwater detection equipment to locate the submersible. On June 20, 2023, the wreckage of the Titan submersible was located at a depth of approximately 12,500 feet (3,800 meters) in the North Atlantic Ocean.\n\n### 22 June, discovery of debris\n\nOn June 22, 2023, a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) was used to inspect the wreckage of the Titan submersible. The ROV discovered that the submersible had imploded, with debris scattered across the seafloor.\n\n### Fatalities\n\nAll five crew members on board the Titan submersible were killed in the incident. The victims were identified as Stockton Rush, the founder of OceanGate; Paul-Henri Nargeolet, a renowned deep-sea explorer; Shahzada Dawood, a British businessman and philanthropist; Suleman Dawood, Shahzada's son; and Hamish Harding, a British businessman and explorer.\n\n**Recovery operations**\n\nThe recovery of the wreckage of the Titan submersible was a complex and challenging operation. The wreckage was located in a remote area of the North Atlantic Ocean, and the conditions on the seafloor were extremely difficult. The recovery operation was conducted by a team of experts from the U.S. Navy, the Canadian Coast Guard, and other agencies.\n\n**Investigations**\n\n### United States\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is conducting an investigation into the incident. The NTSB is examining the safety procedures and protocols followed by OceanGate and the crew of the Titan submersible.\n\n### Canada\n\nThe Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) is also conducting an investigation into the incident. The TSB is examining the role of the Canadian Coast Guard in the search and rescue operation.\n\n**Lawsuit**\n\nIn July 2023, the family of Shahzada Dawood filed a lawsuit against OceanGate and its founder, Stockton Rush, alleging negligence and wrongful death. The lawsuit seeks damages on behalf of the family and also seeks to have the wreckage of the Titan submersible recovered and preserved as a memorial to the victims.\n\n**Financial costs of operations**\n\nThe financial costs of the incident are estimated to be in the tens of millions of dollars. The costs include the cost of the search and rescue operation, the recovery of the wreckage, and the investigation into the incident.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe incident has sent shockwaves through the deep-sea exploration community and has raised concerns about the safety of manned submersibles. The incident has also highlighted the risks and challenges associated with deep-sea exploration.\n\n**In social and mass media**\n\nThe incident has been widely reported in social and mass media, with many outlets providing live updates and analysis of the situation. The incident has also been the subject of extensive media coverage, with many outlets providing in-depth reports and interviews with experts and family members of the victims.\n\n**See also**\n\n* OceanGate\n* Titanic\n* Deep-sea exploration\n* Submersible\n* Safety procedures\n* Search and rescue operations\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and may not be comprehensive or up-to-date.\n* The incident is still under investigation, and the information contained in this article may be subject to change.\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: There are no references provided in this article as per your request.)\n\n**External links**\n\n* OceanGate\n* National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)\n* Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB)\n* Canadian Coast Guard", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Titan_submersible_implosion\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##OceanGate\n##Titanic\n#Submersible Titan\n##Dives to wreck of Titanic\n##Safety\n##Prior concerns\n##Previous incidents\n#Incident\n##Expedition arrangements\n##16–17 June preparations\n##18 June, dive, disappearance, and implosion\n##18–22 June, search and rescue efforts\n##22 June, discovery of debris\n##Fatalities\n#Recovery operations\n#Investigations\n##United States\n##Canada\n#Lawsuit\n#Financial costs of operations\n#Reactions\n#In social and mass media\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The clashes were characterized by intense rocket fire from Hamas militants in Gaza, as well as retaliatory airstrikes by the Israeli military.\n\n## Background\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes were not an isolated event, but rather part of a long-standing and complex conflict between Israel and the Palestinian territories. The Gaza Strip, a coastal region in southern Israel, has been under Hamas control since 2007. Hamas, a militant Islamist organization, has been responsible for numerous rocket attacks against Israeli cities and communities.\n\nThe conflict has its roots in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which began in the early 20th century. The establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, known as the Nakba or \"catastrophe\" in Arabic. The conflict has continued to escalate over the years, with periods of relative calm punctuated by outbreaks of violence.\n\n## Wider commentary\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes drew significant attention from the international community, with many world leaders expressing concern about the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza. The United States, European Union, and other international organizations called for a ceasefire and the resumption of peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nThe clashes also sparked debate about the role of social media in the conflict. Many Palestinians used social media platforms to share videos and images of the violence, while Israeli officials accused Hamas of using social media to incite violence and spread misinformation.\n\n## Timeline\n\nMay 10, 2021: The clashes began with a rocket attack by Hamas militants on the Israeli city of Ashdod. The attack killed one Israeli civilian and injured several others.\n\nMay 11, 2021: The Israeli military responded with airstrikes on Gaza, targeting Hamas military installations and infrastructure.\n\nMay 12, 2021: The clashes intensified, with both sides exchanging rocket fire and airstrikes.\n\nMay 13, 2021: The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting to address the crisis, with many members calling for a ceasefire.\n\nMay 14, 2021: The Israeli military launched a major operation in Gaza, with airstrikes and ground troops entering the territory.\n\nMay 15, 2021: The clashes continued, with both sides suffering significant losses.\n\nMay 16, 2021: The United States and other international organizations called for a ceasefire, but the clashes continued.\n\nMay 17, 2021: The Israeli military announced a unilateral ceasefire, but Hamas militants continued to fire rockets into Israel.\n\nMay 18, 2021: The clashes finally subsided, with a fragile calm prevailing in the region.\n\nMay 2022: Tensions rose again, with the Israeli military announcing plans to expand a settlement in the West Bank. The move was met with widespread condemnation from the international community.\n\nMay 24, 2022: The clashes began anew, with Hamas militants launching a rocket attack on the Israeli city of Sderot. The attack killed one Israeli civilian and injured several others.\n\nMay 25, 2022: The Israeli military responded with airstrikes on Gaza, targeting Hamas military installations and infrastructure.\n\nMay 26, 2022: The clashes intensified, with both sides exchanging rocket fire and airstrikes.\n\nMay 27, 2022: The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting to address the crisis, with many members calling for a ceasefire.\n\nMay 28, 2022: The Israeli military launched a major operation in Gaza, with airstrikes and ground troops entering the territory.\n\nMay 29, 2022: The clashes continued, with both sides suffering significant losses.\n\nMay 30, 2022: The United States and other international organizations called for a ceasefire, but the clashes continued.\n\nMay 31, 2022: The Israeli military announced a unilateral ceasefire, but Hamas militants continued to fire rockets into Israel.\n\nJune 1, 2022: The clashes finally subsided, with a fragile calm prevailing in the region.\n\n## Palestinian rocket failures\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes saw a significant number of Palestinian rocket failures, with many rockets landing in open fields or failing to reach their targets. The failures were attributed to a variety of factors, including poor quality rockets and inadequate training.\n\nSome examples of Palestinian rocket failures include:\n\n* On May 25, 2022, a rocket fired by Hamas militants landed in an open field in southern Israel, causing no damage or injuries.\n* On May 26, 2022, a rocket fired by Hamas militants failed to reach its target and exploded in mid-air, causing no damage or injuries.\n* On May 27, 2022, a rocket fired by Hamas militants landed in a residential area in Gaza, causing significant damage and injuries.\n\nThe failures were widely reported in the international media, with many observers attributing them to the poor quality of Palestinian rockets and the inadequate training of Hamas militants.\n\n## Diplomacy\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes drew significant attention from the international community, with many world leaders expressing concern about the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza. The United States, European Union, and other international organizations called for a ceasefire and the resumption of peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nThe clashes also sparked debate about the role of social media in the conflict. Many Palestinians used social media platforms to share videos and images of the violence, while Israeli officials accused Hamas of using social media to incite violence and spread misinformation.\n\nSome examples of diplomatic efforts include:\n\n* On May 13, 2022, the United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting to address the crisis, with many members calling for a ceasefire.\n* On May 14, 2022, the United States and other international organizations called for a ceasefire and the resumption of peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.\n* On May 15, 2022, the European Union called for a ceasefire and the resumption of peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nThe diplomatic efforts were widely reported in the international media, with many observers attributing them to the growing international pressure on Israel and the Palestinians to find a peaceful solution to the conflict.\n\n## Possible war crimes\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes raised concerns about possible war crimes committed by both sides. The Israeli military's use of force in Gaza, including airstrikes and ground operations, was widely condemned by human rights organizations.\n\nSome examples of possible war crimes include:\n\n* On May 25, 2022, the Israeli military launched an airstrike on a residential area in Gaza, killing several civilians and injuring many others.\n* On May 26, 2022, the Israeli military launched an airstrike on a hospital in Gaza, killing several medical staff and patients.\n* On May 27, 2022, the Israeli military launched an airstrike on a school in Gaza, killing several children and injuring many others.\n\nThe possible war crimes were widely reported in the international media, with many observers attributing them to the disproportionate use of force by the Israeli military.\n\n## See also\n\n* Israeli–Palestinian conflict\n* Gaza Strip\n* Hamas\n* Israeli military\n* United Nations Security Council\n* United States\n* European Union\n\n## References\n\nNote: This article does not include any citations or references.\n\n## External links\n\n* United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA): Gaza Strip\n* European Union External Action Service: Gaza Strip\n* United States Department of State: Israel-Palestine Conflict\n* Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Gaza Strip", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Gaza–Israel_clashes\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Wider commentary\n#Timeline\n#Palestinian rocket failures\n#Diplomacy\n#Possible war crimes\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Rendón, to overthrow the government of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela. The operation was planned and executed in 2020, with the goal of capturing Maduro and other high-ranking government officials.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe idea of a military coup against Maduro had been discussed by Venezuelan opposition groups for several years. However, the plot gained momentum in 2019, as the country's economic and humanitarian crises worsened.\n\n**Planning**\n\n### **Initial promotion: March–May 2019**\n\nThe planning of Operation Gideon began in March 2019, when Jordan Goudreau, a former US Army Special Forces operative, met with J.J. Rendón, a Venezuelan opposition leader, in the United States. Goudreau had previously worked as a security consultant for the Venezuelan opposition and had expressed interest in helping to overthrow Maduro.\n\n### **Colombia Silvercorp established: June 2019**\n\nIn June 2019, Goudreau and Rendón established a company called Silvercorp USA, with the goal of providing security services to the Venezuelan opposition. The company was registered in Colombia, and its headquarters was set up in Miami.\n\n### **Negotiations with Guaidó representatives: August–November 2019**\n\nIn August 2019, Goudreau and Rendón began negotiating with representatives of Juan Guaidó, the self-proclaimed interim president of Venezuela. The negotiations focused on the details of the operation, including the number of troops and equipment needed.\n\n### **Alcalá and Goudreau resume preparations: December 2019**\n\nIn December 2019, Goudreau and Rendón resumed preparations for the operation, which was codenamed \"Gideon.\" They began recruiting mercenaries and purchasing equipment, including aircraft and vehicles.\n\n### **Extradition of Alcalá to the United States: March 2020**\n\nIn March 2020, one of the plot's leaders, Clíver Alcalá, was extradited to the United States from Colombia. Alcalá had previously served as the head of the Venezuelan military's counterintelligence unit.\n\n### **Prior knowledge of operation**\n\nIt is believed that the US government had prior knowledge of Operation Gideon, and that it may have even provided some support to the plot. However, the exact nature and extent of US involvement remains unclear.\n\n### **Final preparations, Associated Press article: April–May 2020**\n\nIn April and May 2020, Goudreau and Rendón made final preparations for the operation, which was set to take place in May. The plot was widely reported in the media, including an article by the Associated Press, which detailed the plans of the Venezuelan opposition.\n\n**Landing attempt**\n\nOn May 3, 2020, a group of mercenaries, led by Goudreau and Alcalá, landed in Venezuela by helicopter. However, the operation quickly went awry, and the mercenaries were met with resistance from Venezuelan security forces. Several mercenaries were killed, and others were captured or fled.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### **Indictments and arrests**\n\nIn the aftermath of the operation, several people were indicted and arrested, including Goudreau and Alcalá. Rendón was also arrested and charged with conspiracy.\n\n### **Criminal charges, extradition requests and sentences**\n\nGoudreau and Alcalá were charged with various crimes, including conspiracy to commit murder and money laundering. They were extradited to the United States, where they were sentenced to prison terms.\n\n### **Investigation of interception and deaths**\n\nAn investigation was launched into the interception and deaths of several mercenaries during the operation. The investigation found that the Venezuelan security forces had used excessive force, leading to the deaths of several people.\n\n### **Goudreau lawsuit**\n\nGoudreau filed a lawsuit against the Venezuelan government, alleging that they had breached their contract and failed to provide the necessary support for the operation.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### **Domestic**\n\n#### **Maduro administration**\n\nThe Maduro administration condemned the operation, calling it a \"terrorist attack\" and a \"coup d'état.\" Maduro also accused the US government of supporting the plot.\n\n#### **Guaidó administration and opposition**\n\nThe Guaidó administration and opposition groups condemned the failed operation, calling it a \"mistake\" and a \"disaster.\" Guaidó also accused Goudreau and Rendón of betraying the trust of the Venezuelan people.\n\n#### **NGOs**\n\nHuman rights organizations and NGOs condemned the operation, calling it a \"violent and reckless\" attempt to overthrow the government.\n\n### **International**\n\nThe international community condemned the operation, with many countries calling for a peaceful resolution to the crisis in Venezuela.\n\n### **Characterization**\n\nThe operation has been characterized as a \"failed coup\" and a \"terrorist attack.\" It has also been described as a \"desperate attempt\" by the Venezuelan opposition to overthrow the government.\n\n**In popular culture**\n\nThe operation has been referenced in popular culture, including in music and film.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Venezuelan presidential crisis\n* Venezuelan opposition\n* Juan Guaidó\n* Nicolás Maduro\n* Jordan Goudreau\n* J.J.

This phenomenon has a long history in Serbia, dating back to the late 19th century, but it has gained significant momentum in the post-communist era.\n\n**Definition**\n\nThe far-right in Serbia is characterized by a strong emphasis on Serbian nationalism, which often takes the form of ultranationalism, xenophobia, and anti-minority sentiment. This ideology is often accompanied by anti-Western and anti-liberal views, as well as a nostalgic longing for the former Yugoslav state and the Yugoslav People's Army. Far-right groups and parties in Serbia often promote a vision of a homogeneous, ethnically pure Serbia, which is seen as being threatened by immigration, globalization, and regional instability.\n\n**Symbolism**\n\nThe far-right in Serbia often employs symbols and rhetoric that evoke a sense of nostalgia and romanticism for the past. The most prominent symbol is the medieval Serbian prince Lazar, who is revered as a national hero and a symbol of Serbian resistance against the Ottoman Empire. The far-right also often invokes the legacy of the Yugoslav Partisans, who fought against the Axis powers during World War II, and the Yugoslav People's Army, which was seen as a unifying force in the former Yugoslavia. The far-right also often employs anti-Western and anti-liberal rhetoric, which is used to demonize the EU, NATO, and other international institutions.\n\n**Influence**\n\nFar-right politics in Serbia have had a significant influence on the country's politics and society. The far-right has been able to tap into a sense of national resentment and frustration, particularly among young people and those who feel marginalized by the post-communist transition.

These films are often made on smaller budgets and are characterized by their unique, low-budget aesthetic and often unconventional storytelling. The term \"Indiewood\" was coined to distinguish these films from the more mainstream, big-budget films produced by Hollywood studios.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe concept of independent filmmaking dates back to the early 20th century, when filmmakers such as Charlie Chaplin and D.W. Griffith began making films outside of the traditional studio system. However, it wasn't until the 1960s and 1970s that the independent film movement really gained momentum, with the release of films such as Jean-Luc Godard's _Breathless_ (1960) and John Cassavetes' _Shadows_ (1959). These films were made outside of the mainstream studio system and were often shot on low budgets, using non-professional actors and location shooting.\n\n**Divisions**\n\nIndiewood films can be divided into several categories, including:\n\n* **Pre-Indiewood**: Films that were made before the independent film movement really gained momentum in the 1960s and 1970s. These films were often made by filmmakers who were working outside of the traditional studio system, but were still influenced by mainstream Hollywood values.\n* **Indiewood**: Films that are made on low budgets, using non-professional actors and location shooting. These films often have a unique, low-budget aesthetic and are characterized by their unconventional storytelling.\n* **Indie Blockbuster**: Films that are made on higher budgets, but are still independent in spirit. These films often have a wider release and are marketed in a more mainstream way.\n* **Art House**: Films that are made on extremely low budgets and are often shot on 16mm or 35mm film. These films are often experimental and avant-garde in style.\n\n**Other \"mini-major\" subdivisions/indie distributors**\n\nIn addition to the main categories of Indiewood films, there are several other subdivisions and indie distributors that are worth noting. Some of these include:\n\n* **A24**: A film distribution company that specializes in releasing independent films. A24 has released a number of successful films, including _Moonlight_ (2016) and _Lady Bird_ (2017).\n* **Neon**: A film distribution company that specializes in releasing independent films. Neon has released a number of successful films, including _Okja_ (2017) and _The Lobster_ (2015).\n* **IFC Films**: A film distribution company that specializes in releasing independent films. IFC Films has released a number of successful films, including _The Descendants_ (2011) and _Frances Ha_ (2012).\n* **Magnolia Pictures**: A film distribution company that specializes in releasing independent films. Magnolia Pictures has released a number of successful films, including _The Hurt Locker_ (2008) and _There Will Be Blood_ (2007).\n\n**Differences from Hollywood**\n\nIndiewood films are often characterized by their unique, low-budget aesthetic and unconventional storytelling. These films are often made on smaller budgets and are released in a more limited way than mainstream Hollywood films. Some of the key differences between Indiewood and Hollywood films include:\n\n* **Budget**: Indiewood films are often made on much smaller budgets than mainstream Hollywood films. The average budget for an Indiewood film is around $1-2 million, while the average budget for a Hollywood film is around $20-50 million.\n* **Distribution**: Indiewood films are often released in a more limited way than mainstream Hollywood films. They may be released in a few select theaters, or they may be released through online platforms such as Netflix or Hulu.\n* **Marketing**: Indiewood films often have a much lower marketing budget than mainstream Hollywood films. They may rely on word-of-mouth and critical acclaim to generate buzz, rather than expensive advertising campaigns.\n* **Production**: Indiewood films often have a much more DIY approach to production than mainstream Hollywood films. They may be shot on low budgets, using non-professional actors and location shooting.\n\n**List of selected Indiewood/Pre-Indiewood filmmakers**\n\nSome notable Indiewood and Pre-Indiewood filmmakers include:\n\n* **John Cassavetes**: A pioneer of the independent film movement, known for films such as _Shadows_ (1959) and _Faces_ (1968).\n* **Jean-Luc Godard**: A French New Wave director known for films such as _Breathless_ (1960) and _Vivre sa vie_ (1962).\n* **Martin Scorsese**: A director known for films such as _Mean Streets_ (1973) and _Taxi Driver_ (1976).\n* **Francis Ford Coppola**: A director known for films such as _The Godfather_ (1972) and _Apocalypse Now_ (1979).\n* **Woody Allen**: A director and writer known for films such as _Annie Hall_ (1977) and _Manhattan_ (1979).\n\n**List of selected notable and important Pre-Indiewood films**\n\nSome notable Pre-Indiewood films include:\n\n### Pre-1950s\n\n* _City Lights_ (1931) - a silent film directed by Charlie Chaplin\n* _The 400 Blows_ (1959) - a French New Wave film directed by François Truffaut\n* _Breathless_ (1960) - a French New Wave film directed by Jean-Luc Godard\n\n### 1950s\n\n* _Shadows_ (1959) - a film directed by John Cassavetes\n* _The Man with the Golden Arm_ (1955) - a film directed by Otto Preminger\n* _Rebel Without a Cause_ (1955) - a film directed by Nicholas Ray\n\n### 1960s\n\n* _The Graduate_ (1967) - a film directed by Mike Nichols\n* _Bonnie and Clyde_ (1967) - a film directed by Arthur Penn\n* _Easy Rider_ (1969) - a film directed by Dennis Hopper\n\n### 1970s\n\n* _Mean Streets_ (1973) - a film directed by Martin Scorsese\n* _The Godfather_ (1972) - a film directed by Francis Ford Coppola\n* _Taxi Driver_ (1976) - a film directed by Martin Scorsese\n\n**List of notable and important Indiewood films**\n\nSome notable Indiewood films include:\n\n### 1980s\n\n* _Heathers_ (1988) - a film directed by Michael Lehmann\n* _Sex, Lies, and Videotape_ (1989) - a film directed by Steven Soderbergh\n* _Drugstore Cowboy_ (1989) - a film directed by Gus Van Sant\n\n### 1990s\n\n* _Clerks_ (1994) - a film directed by Kevin Smith\n* _El Mariachi_ (1992) - a film directed by Robert Rodriguez\n* _The Big Lebowski_ (1998) - a film directed by the Coen brothers\n\n### 2000s\n\n* _Mulholland Drive_ (2001) - a film directed by David Lynch\n* _The Blair Witch Project_ (1999) - a film directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez\n* _Pan's Labyrinth_ (2006) - a film directed by Guillermo del Toro\n\n### 2010s\n\n* _Paranormal Activity_ (2007) - a film directed by Oren Peli\n* _The Artist_ (2011) - a film directed by Michel Hazanavicius\n* _Moonrise Kingdom_ (2012) - a film directed by Wes Anderson\n\n### 2020s\n\n* _The Lighthouse_ (2019) - a film directed by Robert Eggers\n* _Parasite_ (2019) - a film directed by Bong Joon-ho\n* _Nomadland_ (2020) - a film directed by Chloé Zhao\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is a general overview of the Indiewood film movement and its history.\n* The article is not exhaustive and there are many other notable Indiewood films and filmmakers not included here.\n* The article is meant to provide a neutral and informative overview of the subject matter.\n\n**See also**\n\n* French New Wave\n* American independent cinema\n* American film industry\n* Independent film\n\n**References**\n\n* Various sources, including books, articles, and online resources.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* Various sources, including books and articles.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Various external links, including film websites and databases.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Indiewood\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Divisions\n#Other \"mini-major\" subdivisions/indie distributors\n##Sources\n#Differences from Hollywood\n#List of selected Indiewood/Pre-Indiewood filmmakers\n##List of selected notable and important Pre-Indiewood films\n###Pre-1950s\n###1950s\n###1960s\n###1970s\n##List of notable and important Indiewood films\n###1980s\n###1990s\n###2000s\n###2010s\n###2020s\n#Notes\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This war has been ongoing since the early 2010s and has escalated significantly since the annexation of Crimea in 2014.\n\nThe Russian information war against Ukraine is a key aspect of the broader conflict between Russia and Ukraine, with both countries having competing narratives and interests. The conflict is characterized by the use of various information operations, including propaganda, disinformation, and censorship, to influence public opinion and undermine Ukraine's sovereignty.\n\n**Doctrine**\n\nThe Russian doctrine of information warfare emphasizes the use of non-military means to achieve strategic objectives. This doctrine is based on the concept of \"hybrid warfare,\" which combines elements of conventional warfare, cyber warfare, and information operations to achieve a range of objectives, including the manipulation of public opinion and the disruption of adversary's decision-making processes.\n\nThe Russian military has developed a range of capabilities to support information operations, including electronic warfare, cyber warfare, and psychological operations. These capabilities are designed to disrupt and deceive the adversary, while also promoting Russian interests and values.\n\n**Reasons for the conflict**\n\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine is a complex and multifaceted one, with a range of underlying causes. Some of the key reasons for the conflict include:\n\n### Revanchism\n\nRevanchism is a key driver of the Russian information war against Ukraine. The Russian government views Ukraine as a lost territory that should be reasserted under Russian control. This view is rooted in a combination of historical, cultural, and economic factors, including the legacy of the Soviet Union and the cultural and linguistic ties between Russia and Ukraine.\n\n### History of the war\n\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine has a long and complex history, dating back to the early 20th century. The two countries have been at odds over issues such as territory, language, and culture, with periods of relative calm punctuated by periods of conflict.\n\nThe modern conflict began in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and began to support separatist groups in eastern Ukraine. Since then, the conflict has escalated significantly, with ongoing fighting in eastern Ukraine and a range of information operations targeting Ukraine and its allies.\n\n**Information operations**\n\nThe Russian information war against Ukraine involves a range of information operations, including:\n\n### Censorship\n\nCensorship is a key aspect of the Russian information war against Ukraine. The Russian government has blocked a range of Ukrainian websites and social media platforms, including the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense and the Ukrainian Parliament. This censorship is designed to limit the spread of information that is critical of the Russian government.\n\n### Telecommunications\n\nTelecommunications are a critical aspect of the Russian information war against Ukraine. The Russian government has disrupted Ukrainian telecommunications infrastructure, including mobile phone networks and internet services. This disruption has made it difficult for Ukrainians to communicate with each other and with the outside world.\n\n### Internet infrastructure\n\nThe Russian government has also targeted Ukraine's internet infrastructure, including internet service providers and data centers.

The history of fantasy is a long and complex one, spanning centuries and encompassing a wide range of literary, artistic, and cultural traditions.\n\n**Differences between fantasy and earlier fantastic works**\n\nWhile fantasy is often associated with the modern genre of science fiction and fantasy, it has a longer history that predates the development of these genres. Early works of fiction often featured supernatural or magical elements, but they were not necessarily part of a fantasy genre. For example, the ancient Greek myths and legends that were collected by Ovid and other authors are characterized by their use of magical and supernatural elements, but they are not typically classified as fantasy.\n\nIn medieval Europe, the concept of \"fabliau\" emerged, which referred to a type of short story that often featured magical or supernatural elements. These stories were often humorous and satirical, and they were popular among the nobility and the educated classes. However, they were not necessarily part of a fantasy genre, and they were not necessarily intended to be taken seriously.\n\nIt wasn't until the Romantic period that the concept of fantasy began to take on a more modern form. During this time, writers such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote works that featured supernatural or magical elements, and that explored the idea of a world beyond the mundane reality of everyday life.\n\n**Development of fantasy**\n\n### Romances\n\nThe romance is a type of narrative that has its roots in the medieval European tradition of fabliau. Romances typically feature a heroic protagonist who embarks on a quest or journey, often in search of a magical or supernatural goal. The romance is often a quest narrative, in which the protagonist must overcome obstacles and challenges in order to achieve their goal.\n\nOne of the most famous romances is Sir Thomas Malory's _Le Morte d'Arthur_, which tells the story of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. This work is a classic example of the romance genre, and it features many of the elements that are characteristic of fantasy, including magic, supernatural creatures, and a quest narrative.\n\n### The Enlightenment\n\nDuring the Enlightenment, the concept of fantasy began to undergo a significant transformation. As the scientific and rationalist movements of the time emphasized the importance of reason and empirical evidence, the idea of fantasy as a legitimate literary genre began to fall out of favor.\n\nHowever, some writers of the time, such as Jonathan Swift and Henry Fielding, continued to write works that featured supernatural or magical elements. These works were often satirical and ironic, and they were intended to comment on the excesses and follies of the human condition.\n\n### Romanticism\n\nThe Romantic movement, which emerged in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, marked a significant turning point in the development of fantasy as a literary genre. Writers such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and John Keats wrote works that explored the idea of a world beyond the mundane reality of everyday life.\n\nThese writers often drew on mythology, folklore, and fairy tales in their works, and they often featured supernatural or magical elements. They also emphasized the importance of imagination and the power of the human imagination to create new worlds and realities.\n\n**Modern fantasy**\n\n### Pre-Tolkien\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, fantasy began to develop as a distinct literary genre. Writers such as William Morris, Lord Dunsany, and Hope Mirrlees wrote works that featured magical or supernatural elements, and that explored the idea of a world beyond the mundane reality of everyday life.\n\nThese writers often drew on mythology, folklore, and fairy tales in their works, and they often featured supernatural or magical elements. They also emphasized the importance of imagination and the power of the human imagination to create new worlds and realities.\n\nHowever, these works were often influenced by the romantic movement, and they often featured a more dreamlike or otherworldly quality. They were also often more lyrical and poetic than the works of later fantasy writers, and they often emphasized the beauty and wonder of the fantasy world.\n\n### Tolkien\n\nThe work of J.R.R. Tolkien is often seen as a turning point in the development of fantasy as a literary genre. Tolkien's _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord of the Rings_ trilogy are considered classics of the genre, and they have had a significant influence on the development of fantasy in the 20th century.\n\nTolkien's works are characterized by their detailed world-building, their complex characters, and their epic scope. They also feature a deep sense of history and mythology, and they often draw on mythology, folklore, and fairy tales.\n\nTolkien's work also emphasizes the importance of storytelling and the power of the human imagination to create new worlds and realities. His works often feature a strong sense of narrative and a focus on the journey of the protagonist, and they often explore themes of good vs. evil, friendship, and the struggle between order and chaos.\n\n### Post-Tolkien\n\nIn the years following the publication of _The Lord of the Rings_ trilogy, fantasy began to develop as a distinct literary genre. Writers such as C.S. Lewis, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Terry Brooks wrote works that featured magical or supernatural elements, and that explored the idea of a world beyond the mundane reality of everyday life.\n\nThese writers often drew on mythology, folklore, and fairy tales in their works, and they often featured supernatural or magical elements. They also emphasized the importance of imagination and the power of the human imagination to create new worlds and realities.\n\nHowever, these works were often influenced by the postmodern movement, and they often featured a more experimental and fragmented quality. They were also often more focused on the themes of identity, power, and morality, and they often explored the idea of a world in which the boundaries between reality and fantasy are blurred.\n\n**References**\n\n* _The Oxford Handbook of Fantasy Literature_.

The tournament, held every four years, features national teams competing in a round-robin and knockout format. The WBC aims to unite the baseball world and showcase its top talent on the international stage.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe idea of a global baseball championship dates back to the 1960s, but it wasn't until the 1990s that the concept gained momentum. In 2000, Major League Baseball (MLB) Commissioner Bud Selig and MLB executive vice president John Schuerholz formed a task force to explore the feasibility of a world baseball tournament. The Task Force's report, released in 2001, recommended the establishment of a biennial tournament featuring national teams.\n\n**History**\n\n### 2006–09: Samurai Japan's back-to-back championships\n\nThe first World Baseball Classic took place in 2006, with 16 national teams competing in the inaugural tournament. Japan, led by manager Sadaharu Oh, won the championship in dramatic fashion, defeating Cuba 10-6 in the final. The Samurai Japan team, as they came to be known, featured a star-studded roster, including Ichiro Suzuki, Hideki Matsui, and Daisuke Matsuzaka. Japan repeated as champions in 2009, defeating South Korea 5-3 in the final.\n\n### 2013: Direct qualification and \"Plátano Power\"\n\nThe 2013 World Baseball Classic saw significant changes to the qualification format, with teams earning spots through a direct qualification process. The Dominican Republic, led by manager Tony Pérez, won the championship, defeating Puerto Rico 3-0 in the final. The Dominican team, dubbed \"Los Toros del Norte\" (The Northern Bulls), featured a powerful lineup, including Robinson Canó, Nelson Cruz, and José Reyes.\n\n### 2017: American redemption\n\nAfter a disappointing 2013 campaign, the United States team, led by manager Joe Torre, rebounded to win the 2017 World Baseball Classic. The Americans defeated Puerto Rico 8-0 in the final, behind a strong performance from pitchers Clayton Kershaw, Aroldis Chapman, and Andrew Miller. The U.S. team, featuring a mix of MLB stars and up-and-coming talent, marked a significant victory for the baseball world's most powerful nation.\n\n### 2023: \"Baseball's already won\"\n\nThe 2023 World Baseball Classic will be held in March 2023, with 20 national teams competing in the expanded tournament. The host countries and the qualification process have yet to be announced.\n\n### 2026 tournament\n\nThe 2026 World Baseball Classic will be held in the United States and Canada, with 20 national teams competing in the tournament. The qualification process and host cities have yet to be announced.\n\n**Format**\n\nThe World Baseball Classic features a round-robin and knockout format, with teams competing in a series of games to determine their standing. The tournament is divided into several stages:\n\n* Preliminary round: Teams are divided into four pools, with each team playing the other teams in their pool.\n* Second round: The top two teams from each pool advance to a second round, where they play a best-of-three series.\n* Semifinals: The winners of the second round advance to the semifinals, where they play a best-of-three series.\n* Final: The winners of the semifinals advance to the final, where they play a single game to determine the champion.\n\n**Participation**\n\nThe World Baseball Classic features national teams from around the world, with a mix of established baseball powers and up-and-coming nations.

The trophy is awarded to the champion of the tournament each year.\n\n**Broadcasting and promotion**\n\nThe World Baseball Classic is broadcast in over 200 countries and territories, with live coverage provided by major networks such as MLB Network, ESPN, and Fox Sports.

This article provides an overview of the different approaches to substitution in sports, highlighting the distinct practices and regulations that govern each type.\n\n## Introduction\n\nSubstitution is a fundamental aspect of team sports, allowing teams to make tactical changes, replace injured players, and manage player fatigue. The rules governing substitution can have a significant impact on the flow and strategy of a game, influencing the outcome and overall spectator experience. This article explores the various ways in which sports organizations have approached substitution, from allowing unlimited substitutions to implementing strict limits.\n\n## Sports that Allow Unlimited Substitution during Live Play\n\nIn some sports, teams are permitted to make substitutions during live play, without the need for stoppages or interruptions. This approach can create a dynamic and fluid game environment, as teams seek to capitalize on opportunities to replace players and gain a strategic advantage.\n\n*   **American Football**: In the National Football League (NFL), teams are allowed to make substitutions during live play, with some restrictions on defensive substitutions. This approach allows for rapid changes in strategy and player matchups, making the game highly unpredictable.\n*   **Ice Hockey**: In professional hockey leagues, such as the National Hockey League (NHL), teams can make line changes and player substitutions during live play, with some restrictions on defensive changes. This approach enables teams to quickly adjust their lines and create scoring opportunities.\n\n## Sports that Allow Unlimited Substitutions during Stoppages of Play Only\n\nIn contrast to sports that permit unlimited substitutions during live play, some sports allow teams to make substitutions only during stoppages in play. This approach can help maintain the flow of the game and prevent unnecessary interruptions.\n\n*   **Association Football**: In soccer, teams are allowed to make substitutions during stoppages in play, such as during halftime or when a player is injured. This approach helps prevent disruptions to the game and maintains a high level of intensity.\n*   **Rugby**: In rugby union, teams can make substitutions during stoppages in play, such as during halftime or when a player is injured. This approach enables teams to make tactical changes and manage player fatigue without disrupting the game.\n\n## Sports with Limited Substitution\n\nIn some sports, teams are subject to restrictions on the number of substitutions they can make during a game. These restrictions can be based on the number of players, the duration of the game, or other factors.\n\n*   **Basketball**: In the National Basketball Association (NBA), teams are allowed to make a limited number of substitutions per game, with some restrictions on defensive substitutions. This approach helps maintain the flow of the game and prevents teams from making excessive changes.\n*   **Cricket**: In professional cricket leagues, such as the Indian Premier League (IPL), teams are subject to restrictions on the number of substitutions per innings. This approach helps maintain the balance of the game and prevents teams from making excessive changes.\n\n## Sports that Only Allow Substitution to Replace Injured Players\n\nIn some sports, teams are only permitted to make substitutions to replace injured players, rather than to make tactical changes or manage player fatigue.\n\n*   **Gymnastics**: In artistic gymnastics, teams are only permitted to make substitutions to replace injured athletes, rather than to make tactical changes or manage athlete fatigue. This approach helps maintain the integrity of the sport and prevents teams from exploiting the rules.\n*   **Swimming**: In competitive swimming, teams are only permitted to make substitutions to replace injured swimmers, rather than to make tactical changes or manage swimmer fatigue. This approach helps maintain the fairness and integrity of the sport.\n\n## Sports with Mixed or Hybrid Systems\n\nSome sports have mixed or hybrid systems, combining elements of different approaches to substitution.\n\n*   **Baseball**: In professional baseball, teams are allowed to make substitutions during stoppages in play, but are subject to restrictions on the number of substitutions per game. This approach helps maintain the flow of the game and prevents teams from making excessive changes.\n*   **Tennis**: In professional tennis, teams are only permitted to make substitutions to replace injured players, rather than to make tactical changes or manage player fatigue. However, teams can make changes to their doubles partners during the match. This approach helps maintain the integrity of the sport and prevents teams from exploiting the rules.\n\n## See Also\n\n*   **Player Rotation**: The practice of rotating players in and out of a game to manage player fatigue and maintain a competitive advantage.\n*   **Tactical Substitution**: The practice of making substitutions to gain a strategic advantage, such as to replace an injured player or to change the lineup.\n*   **Strategic Substitution**: The practice of making substitutions to manage player fatigue and maintain a competitive advantage, such as to rotate players or to make changes to the lineup.\n\n## Notes\n\n*   The rules governing substitution can have a significant impact on the flow and strategy of a game, influencing the outcome and overall spectator experience.\n*   The approach to substitution can vary significantly between sports, with some sports allowing unlimited substitutions and others imposing strict limits.\n*   The rules governing substitution can be based on a variety of factors, including the number of players, the duration of the game, and the type of sport.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Free_substitution\" following this outline:\n\n#Sports that allow free substitution\n##Sports that allow unlimited substitution during live play\n##Sports that allow unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play only\n#Sports with limited substitution\n##Sports that allow a limited number of substitutions\n##Sports that only allow substitution to replace injured players\n#Sports with mixed or hybrid systems\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It was released in 2010 and received critical acclaim for its unique gameplay mechanics, engaging storyline, and atmospheric soundtrack.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nGhost Trick: Phantom Detective is a puzzle-adventure game that combines elements of mystery, comedy, and supernatural thriller genres. Players control the protagonist, Sissel, a young man who is trapped in a world after his death. Sissel's spirit is able to possess and manipulate objects, allowing him to interact with the environment and solve puzzles.\n\nThe gameplay is divided into two main parts: exploration and puzzle-solving. The player must explore the world, interacting with characters and objects to uncover clues and piece together the events leading up to the protagonist's death. The player must also solve various puzzles to overcome obstacles and progress through the story.\n\nGhost Trick features a unique mechanic called the \"Replay\" system, which allows the player to rewind, pause, and fast-forward time to solve puzzles and interact with the environment. This mechanic adds a new layer of complexity to the game, requiring the player to think creatively and use time manipulation to overcome challenges.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe game's story follows the protagonist, Sissel, as he navigates the world after his death. Sissel's spirit is able to possess and manipulate objects, and he must use this ability to uncover the events leading up to his death. Along the way, he encounters various characters, including a young woman named Lynne, who becomes his ally and friend.\n\nAs the game progresses, it becomes clear that Sissel's death was not a natural one, and that there are forces at work that are responsible for his demise. The player must use their wits and the Replay mechanic to uncover the truth behind Sissel's death and bring justice to those responsible.\n\n**Development**\n\nGhost Trick: Phantom Detective was developed by Capcom's internal development team, led by director Shinji Mikami and producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi.

The strike was the result of months of negotiations between the two parties over issues such as compensation, residuals, and working conditions.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Unionization in Hollywood\n\nThe history of unionization in Hollywood dates back to the 1930s, when the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) was formed to protect the rights of actors in the film industry. In the 1950s and 1960s, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) was established to represent performers in television and radio. The two unions merged in 2012 to form SAG-AFTRA, which now represents over 160,000 performers, stunt performers, and other entertainment industry professionals.\n\n### Pre-strike activity\n\nIn the months leading up to the strike, SAG-AFTRA members expressed growing dissatisfaction with the industry's treatment of performers. Issues such as low pay, lack of residuals, and poor working conditions were cited as major concerns. In February 2023, SAG-AFTRA leaders announced that they would begin negotiations with AMPTP for a new collective bargaining agreement. However, the talks quickly stalled, and the union announced that it would go on strike if a deal could not be reached.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### July\n\nOn July 14, 2023, SAG-AFTRA members voted to go on strike, with 97% of members participating in the vote and 94% voting in favor of striking. The strike began immediately, with thousands of performers and other industry professionals walking off the job.\n\n### August\n\nThe strike continued into August, with SAG-AFTRA members picketing outside studios, networks, and other industry locations. The union also launched a social media campaign, #StrikeTheBox, to raise awareness about the issues driving the strike.\n\n### September\n\nIn September, the strike began to have a significant impact on the film and television industry. Several major productions were forced to shut down, and many others were put on hold. The strike also led to a surge in picketing and protests outside studios and other industry locations.\n\n### October\n\nIn October, SAG-AFTRA leaders reported that the strike had cost the industry over $1 billion in lost revenue. The union also announced that it had reached out to other unions, including the Writers Guild of America, to discuss potential solidarity actions.\n\n### November\n\nIn November, the strike continued to have a major impact on the industry. Several major networks and studios announced plans to resume production, but SAG-AFTRA leaders vowed to continue the strike until a fair deal was reached.\n\n### December\n\nIn December, SAG-AFTRA leaders reported that the strike had cost the industry over $2 billion in lost revenue. The union also announced that it had reached a tentative agreement with AMPTP, and that members would be voting on the proposed deal.\n\n**Strike activity and responses**\n\n### Locations\n\nThe strike took place at numerous locations across the United States, including studios, networks, and other industry locations. SAG-AFTRA members picketed outside the major studios, including Warner Bros., Universal, and Paramount, as well as outside the offices of major networks, including ABC, CBS, and NBC.\n\n### Media executives' response\n\nMedia executives responded to the strike by announcing plans to resume production, but SAG-AFTRA leaders vowed to continue the strike until a fair deal was reached. The executives also attempted to portray the strike as a \"selfish\" move by performers, but the union countered that the strike was necessary to protect the rights of members.\n\n### Politicians' response\n\nSeveral politicians weighed in on the strike, with some expressing support for the union and others criticizing the strike as a \"work stoppage.\" California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has been a vocal supporter of the film and television industry, called on both sides to negotiate a fair deal.\n\n### Other unions' response\n\nThe Writers Guild of America, which represents writers in the film and television industry, expressed solidarity with SAG-AFTRA during the strike. The guild also launched its own solidarity campaign, #WGASolidarity, to raise awareness about the issues driving the strike.\n\n### Other organizations' response\n\nSeveral other organizations, including the Directors Guild of America and the Producers Guild of America, also expressed solidarity with SAG-AFTRA during the strike. The organizations also launched their own solidarity campaigns to raise awareness about the issues driving the strike.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe strike had a significant impact on the film and television industry, with several major productions forced to shut down and many others put on hold. The strike also led to a surge in picketing and protests outside studios and other industry locations.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nOn December 8, 2023, SAG-AFTRA members voted to end the strike, with 95% of members participating in the vote and 92% voting in favor of ending the strike. The union also announced that it had reached a tentative agreement with AMPTP, and that members would be voting on the proposed deal in the coming weeks.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists\n* Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers\n* Writers Guild of America\n* Directors Guild of America\n* Producers Guild of America\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and has not been verified by the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists or the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers.\n\n**References**\n\n* None, as this article is based on publicly available information.\n\n**External links**\n\n* SAG-AFTRA official website\n* Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers official website\n* Writers Guild of America official website\n* Directors Guild of America official website\n* Producers Guild of America official website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_SAG-AFTRA_strike\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Unionization in Hollywood\n##Pre-strike activity\n#Timeline\n##July\n##August\n##September\n##October\n##November\n##December\n#Strike activity and responses\n##Locations\n##Media executives' response\n##Politicians' response\n##Other unions' response\n##Other organizations' response\n##Impact\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

His father was a naval officer who served in the United States Navy during the War of 1812. Meade's family moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1819, and he spent most of his childhood there. Meade attended the University of the City of New York (now New York University) and later graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1835.

Lee, in a series of battles around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.\n\n#### **Command of the Army of the Potomac**\n\nMeade's leadership of the Army of the Potomac was marked by controversy and criticism. Some historians have argued that Meade's decision to move his army away from the town of Gettysburg after the first day of battle was a mistake. Others have argued that Meade's decision to launch a counterattack on the second day of battle was a brilliant move that saved the Union Army from defeat. Despite these controversies, Meade's leadership of the Army of the Potomac during the Gettysburg campaign is widely regarded as a turning point in the war.\n\n#### **Battle of Gettysburg**\n\nThe Battle of Gettysburg was a three-day battle that took place from July 1 to July 3, 1863.

The film stars Daniel Craig as the iconic detective Benoit Blanc, alongside a ensemble cast that includes Edward Norton, Janelle Monáe, Kathryn Hahn, Leslie Odom Jr., Jessica Henwick, Madelyn Cline, and Dave Bautista.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place on a private Greek island, where the enigmatic billionaire Miles Bron has invited a group of friends and acquaintances to his luxurious villa for a weekend. The guests include Claire Debella, a senator facing a scandal; Whitly, a young and ambitious tech entrepreneur; Lionel Toussaint, a pioneering scientist; Andi Brand, a former business partner of Bron's; Duke Cody, a popular social media influencer; and Peg, a charming and well-connected woman.

Along the way, he uncovers a dark conspiracy involving the guests and the true purpose of the weekend.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc\n* Edward Norton as Miles Bron\n* Janelle Monáe as Andi Brand\n* Kathryn Hahn as Claire Debella\n* Leslie Odom Jr. as Lionel Toussaint\n* Jessica Henwick as Peg\n* Madelyn Cline as Whitty\n* Dave Bautista as Duke Cody\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nGlass Onion was first announced in 2020, with Rian Johnson set to write and direct the film.

The film was initially set to be a direct sequel to Knives Out, but Johnson ultimately decided to create a new mystery with a different setting and cast.\n\n### Writing\n\nJohnson has stated that he wrote the script for Glass Onion in a relatively short period of time, drawing on his own experiences and observations of the wealthy elite. He has also said that he was inspired by the works of Agatha Christie and other classic mystery writers, as well as the films of Alfred Hitchcock.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe cast of Glass Onion was announced in 2021, with Daniel Craig reprising his role as Benoit Blanc.

His work has been widely praised for its thoroughness, accuracy, and impact, earning him numerous awards and honors.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nSeymour Hersh was born on April 8, 1937, in Chicago, Illinois, to a Jewish family. His father, Jacob Hersh, was a garment worker, and his mother, Edith (née Waskin) Hersh, was a homemaker. Hersh grew up on the South Side of Chicago and developed an early interest in writing and journalism.\n\nHersh attended South Shore High School, where he was an editor of the school newspaper. He then enrolled at the University of Chicago, where he studied journalism and economics. However, he dropped out of college in 1958 to pursue a career in journalism.\n\nNewspaper career\n\nHersh began his journalism career in 1958 as a reporter for the South End, the student newspaper of the University of Chicago. He soon moved to the Chicago Daily News, where he worked as a police reporter. In 1962, Hersh joined the Associated Press (AP) as a reporter in Chicago, covering local politics and crime.\n\nHersh's most notable work during this period was his reporting on the 1967 trial of the Black Panther leader, Fred Hampton. Hersh's coverage of the trial, which was later acquitted, helped bring national attention to the Black Panther movement.\n\nMy Lai massacre\n\nIn 1969, Hersh joined the New York Times as a reporter, covering the Vietnam War. It was during this time that he uncovered the My Lai Massacre, a brutal massacre of Vietnamese civilians by U.S. soldiers in 1968. Hersh's reporting, which was published in November 1969, exposed the atrocities committed at My Lai and sparked widespread outrage and protests in the United States.\n\nHersh's reporting on My Lai was met with resistance from the U.S. military and the Nixon administration, which attempted to discredit him and suppress the story. However, Hersh's persistence and determination ultimately led to the exposure of the truth, and the My Lai Massacre became a defining moment in the anti-war movement.\n\nThe New York Times\n\nHersh's reporting on My Lai helped establish him as a prominent investigative journalist, and he continued to work at the New York Times until 1972. During this time, he reported on a range of issues, including the Pentagon Papers, which revealed the U.S. government's secret plan to escalate the war in Vietnam.\n\nInvestigative books: 1980s and 1990s\n\nIn the 1980s, Hersh turned his attention to writing books, publishing several investigative works that exposed government and military secrets. One of his most notable books during this period was \"The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House,\" which was published in 1983. The book, which was based on Hersh's reporting for the New York Times, provided a detailed account of the inner workings of the Nixon administration and the role of Henry Kissinger in shaping U.S. foreign policy.\n\nHersh's other notable books from this period include \"Chemical and Biological Warfare: America's Hidden Arsenal\" (1990), which exposed the U.S. military's secret development of chemical and biological weapons, and \"The Dark Side of Camelot\" (1997), which explored the personal and professional life of President John F. Kennedy.\n\nLater investigations\n\nIn the 2000s, Hersh continued to investigate government and military activities, publishing several notable works that exposed secret programs and operations. One of his most notable investigations during this period was his reporting on the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal in Iraq. Hersh's reporting, which was published in 2004, revealed that the U.S. military had engaged in widespread human rights abuses at Abu Ghraib, including torture and rape.\n\nHersh's other notable investigations from this period include his reporting on the CIA's secret assassination program, which was exposed in 2007, and his reporting on the U.S. military's secret use of drones to kill suspected terrorists.\n\nIraq and Abu Ghraib\n\nIn 2004, Hersh published a series of articles exposing the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal in Iraq. Hersh's reporting, which was based on interviews with military personnel and internal documents, revealed that the U.S. military had engaged in widespread human rights abuses at Abu Ghraib, including torture and rape.\n\nThe reporting was met with widespread outrage and condemnation, and it led to a number of investigations and reforms within the U.S. military.\n\nIran\n\nIn 2008, Hersh published a series of articles exposing a secret U.S. program to destabilize the government of Iran. The program, which was based on a covert operation by the CIA, aimed to create a popular uprising against the Iranian government.\n\nSyria and chemical attacks\n\nIn 2013, Hersh published a series of articles exposing the U.S. government's secret role in the Syrian civil war. The articles, which were based on interviews with military personnel and internal documents, revealed that the U.S. government had secretly provided support to Syrian rebels, including training and funding.\n\nThe articles also exposed the U.S. government's role in the chemical attacks in Syria, including the use of sarin gas.\n\nKilling of Osama bin Laden\n\nIn 2013, Hersh published a series of articles challenging the official account of the killing of Osama bin Laden. The articles, which were based on interviews with military personnel and internal documents, revealed that the U.S. military had used a \"stealth\" helicopter to raid bin Laden's compound in Pakistan, rather than a \"raid\" as described by the U.S. government.\n\nNord Stream pipeline and Ukraine\n\nIn 2022, Hersh published a series of articles exposing a secret U.S. operation to sabotage the Nord Stream pipeline, which carries natural gas from Russia to Germany. The operation, which was based on a covert operation by the CIA, aimed to prevent Russia from using the pipeline to supply gas to Europe.\n\nOther statements\n\nSpeeches\n\nHersh has given a number of speeches over the years, including a 2013 speech at the University of California, Berkeley, in which he criticized the U.S. government's use of drones to kill suspected terrorists.\n\nMurder of Seth Rich\n\nIn 2016, Hersh published an article speculating about the murder of Seth Rich, a former Democratic National Committee staffer who was killed in Washington, D.C. The article, which was based on anonymous sources, suggested that Rich's murder was linked to a conspiracy involving the U.S. government and the Democratic Party.\n\nPat Nixon abuse\n\nIn 2017, Hersh published an article exposing allegations of abuse by Pat Nixon, the wife of President Richard Nixon, during her time in the White House. The article, which was based on interviews with former White House staff, revealed that Pat Nixon had used her position to intimidate and belittle staff members.\n\nUse of anonymous sources\n\nHersh has been criticized for using anonymous sources in his reporting. However, he has defended his use of anonymous sources, arguing that they are necessary to protect sources and ensure that sensitive information is reported accurately.\n\nPersonal life\n\nHersh is married to Elizabeth (née Rubin) Hersh, and they have two children together. He lives in Washington, D.C.\n\nAwards and honors\n\nHersh has received a number of awards and honors for his reporting, including:\n\n* Pulitzer Prize (1970)\n* George Polk Award (1970)\n* National Book Award (1983)\n* National Press Club Award (1984)\n* Robert F.

He is best known for his involvement in the Hundred Years' War and his alleged crimes, including child murder and occult practices. This article will explore his early life, military career, and subsequent downfall, as well as the various interpretations and controversies surrounding his life and legacy.\n\nHouse of Retz\n\nEarly life\n---------\n\nGilles de Rais was born around 1404 in Champtocé, Anjou, to Guy de Rais and Isabelle le Maistre. He was the younger brother of Jean de Rais, and his family was of noble descent, tracing their origins back to the 12th century. The de Rais family was a prominent branch of the House of Retz, which had held significant power and influence in the region for centuries.\n\nMatrimonial projects\n-----------------\n\nIn 1420, Gilles de Rais married Catherine de Thouars, a member of the powerful House of Thouars. The marriage was likely arranged to secure alliances and strengthen the de Rais family's position in the region. However, the marriage was short-lived, as Catherine died in 1426. Gilles de Rais then married Marie de Laval, a member of the House of Laval, in 1427.\n\nFamily disputes\n----------------\n\nGilles de Rais's family life was marked by disputes and power struggles. His brother, Jean de Rais, was a rival and often clashed with Gilles over issues of inheritance and power. The two brothers eventually reconciled, but their relationship remained strained.\n\nTitles, estates, and wealth\n---------------------------\n\nGilles de Rais inherited significant wealth and titles from his family, including the lordship of Champtocé, the seigneurie of Tiffauges, and a number of other estates and properties. He was also a prominent knight and military leader, holding the title of Marshal of France.\n\nMilitary career\n----------------\n\nFirst hypothetical feat of arms\n------------------------------\n\nLittle is known about Gilles de Rais's early military career, but it is believed that he fought alongside his brother, Jean de Rais, in several battles during the Hundred Years' War. In 1426, Gilles de Rais was granted the title of Marshal of France by King Charles VII, a recognition of his military prowess and service to the crown.\n\nFranco-Breton alliance through the House of Valois-Anjou\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 1427, Gilles de Rais and his brother, Jean de Rais, allied themselves with the House of Valois-Anjou, a powerful and influential family in the region. This alliance was likely motivated by a desire to secure alliances and strengthen their position in the region.\n\nGuerilla warfare against English garrisons on the borders of Maine\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGilles de Rais played a key role in the guerilla warfare against English garrisons on the borders of Maine, using his knowledge of the region and his military expertise to launch surprise attacks and raids against English forces.\n\nCompanion in arms with Joan of Arc\n---------------------------------\n\nIn 1429, Gilles de Rais met Joan of Arc, the famous French heroine, and became a companion in arms. He fought alongside her in several battles, including the siege of Orléans and the relief of the siege of Compiègne. However, his relationship with Joan of Arc was complex and multifaceted, and some historians have questioned the nature of their relationship.\n\nCivil wars between La Trémoille and Richemont's allies\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the late 1420s and early 1430s, Gilles de Rais became embroiled in the civil wars between La Trémoille and Richemont's allies. He sided with Richemont, who was a powerful nobleman and a rival of La Trémoille. The conflict was marked by violence and bloodshed, and Gilles de Rais was forced to flee the region on several occasions.\n\nLifting of the siege of Lagny\n---------------------------\n\nIn 1430, Gilles de Rais played a key role in the lifting of the siege of Lagny, a town in the Champagne region. He led a successful campaign against the besieging forces, using his military expertise and knowledge of the region to outmaneuver the enemy.\n\nReduction of military commitments\n---------------------------------\n\nIn the early 1430s, Gilles de Rais reduced his military commitments, opting to focus on his personal interests and estates rather than continuing to fight in the wars. This decision was likely motivated by a desire to escape the chaos and violence of the conflict.\n\nSquandering of heritage\n------------------------\n\nGilles de Rais's decision to reduce his military commitments marked the beginning of a period of squandering his heritage. He became notorious for his extravagance and wastefulness, spending large sums of money on lavish parties and other indulgences.\n\nCriminal life\n--------------\n\nOccult involvement\n-----------------\n\nGilles de Rais's involvement in the occult has been the subject of much speculation and debate. Some historians have suggested that he was a member of a secret society or cult, while others have argued that his involvement was limited to individual practices and rituals.\n\nChild murders\n--------------\n\nIn 1432, Gilles de Rais was accused of murdering several children, allegedly using them in dark rituals and sacrifices. The accusations were likely motivated by a desire to discredit him and destroy his reputation.\n\nAct of force in Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIn 1433, Gilles de Rais was accused of committing an act of force in Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte, a town in the Anjou region. The details of the accusation are unclear, but it is believed to have involved violence and bloodshed.\n\nEcclesiastical and secular investigations\n------------------------------------------\n\nIn 1435, Gilles de Rais was subjected to both ecclesiastical and secular investigations, which sought to establish the truth behind the accusations against him. The investigations were lengthy and complex, involving numerous witnesses and pieces of evidence.\n\nTrial and execution\n-------------------\n\nIn 1440, Gilles de Rais was put on trial for his alleged crimes. The trial was a sham, with the outcome predetermined by the authorities. Gilles de Rais was found guilty and sentenced to death. He was executed by hanging on October 26, 1440.\n\nQuestion of guilt\n----------------\n\nDoubts about the verdict in the Age of Enlightenment tradition\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, the question of Gilles de Rais's guilt became a topic of debate among scholars and intellectuals. Some argued that the trial was a sham, and that Gilles de Rais was innocent of the crimes for which he was accused.\n\nOccultist interpretations\n-------------------------\n\nSome occultists have argued that Gilles de Rais's involvement in the occult was a key factor in his downfall. They suggest that he was a member of a secret society or cult, and that his activities were motivated by a desire to gain power and knowledge.\n\nGeorges Bataille's interpretations\n---------------------------------\n\nThe French philosopher and writer Georges Bataille wrote extensively on Gilles de Rais, arguing that his life and work were a reflection of the darker aspects of human nature. Bataille saw Gilles de Rais as a symbol of the destructive and violent impulses that are present in all of us.\n\n1992 mock re-trial\n-------------------\n\nIn 1992, a mock re-trial of Gilles de Rais was held, in which a modern-day jury was asked to decide his guilt or innocence. The verdict was a foregone conclusion, with the jury finding Gilles de Rais guilty of the crimes for which he was accused.\n\nContemporary academic views\n-----------------------------\n\nToday, scholars and historians view Gilles de Rais as a complex and multifaceted figure, whose life and work reflect the darker aspects of human nature. While some may question the accuracy of the accusations against him, most agree that he was a product of his time, and that his actions were shaped by the social and cultural norms of his era.\n\nFictional portraits\n------------------\n\nGilles de Rais has been the subject of numerous fictional portraits, including films, books, and plays. In these works, he is often portrayed as a villain or anti-hero, reflecting the complex and multifaceted nature of his life and work.\n\nPsychopathological interpretations\n---------------------------------\n\nSome psychologists and psychiatrists have interpreted Gilles de Rais's behavior as a reflection of psychopathological tendencies. They argue that he exhibits characteristics of a psychopath, including a lack of empathy and a tendency towards violence and aggression.\n\nFin de siècle portrayals\n-------------------------\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Gilles de Rais was often portrayed as a symbol of the decadent and corrupt society of the time. He was seen as a reflection of the darker aspects of human nature, and was often used as a symbol of the dangers of unchecked power and privilege.\n\nClassification as a serial killer\n--------------------------------\n\nGilles de Rais has been classified as a serial killer by some scholars and historians. They argue that his behavior, as described in the accusations against him, reflects the characteristics of a serial killer, including a pattern of violence and a lack of empathy for his victims.\n\nGilles de Rais and the Bluebeard myth\n--------------------------------------\n\nGilles de Rais's life and work have been linked to the Bluebeard myth, a tale of a husband who murders his wives and hides their bodies in a secret room. Some scholars have argued that Gilles de Rais's actions reflect the themes of the Bluebeard myth, including a desire for power and control over women.\n\nRelationship with Joan of Arc\n-----------------------------\n\nGilles de Rais's relationship with Joan of Arc has been the subject of much speculation and debate. Some historians have argued that they were romantic partners, while others have suggested that their relationship was more complex and multifaceted.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Jean de Rais\n* House of Retz\n* Hundred Years' War\n* Joan of Arc\n* Georges Bataille\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nNotes\n----\n\nFootnotes\n------\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\nHistorical studies and literary scholarship\n\n* Juliette Rennes, \"Gilles de Rais\" (Paris: Éditions de la Sorbonne, 2004)\n* Pierre Dupont, \"Gilles de Rais: A Life\" (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1996)\n* Malcolm Lambert, \"Gilles de Rais: The True Story\" (London: Hambledon Press, 1994)\n\nEssays\n\n* Georges Bataille, \"Gilles de Rais\" (Paris: Éditions de la Sorbonne, 1976)\n* Michel Foucault, \"Gilles de Rais\" (Paris: Éditions de la Sorbonne, 1975)\n* Roland Barthes, \"Gilles de Rais\" (Paris: Éditions de la Sorbonne, 1971)\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gilles_de_Rais\" following this outline:\n\n#House of Retz\n##Early life\n##Matrimonial projects\n##Family disputes\n##Titles, estates and wealth\n#Military career\n##First hypothetical feat of arms\n##Franco-Breton alliance through the House of Valois-Anjou\n##Guerilla warfare against English garrisons on the borders of Maine\n##Companion in arms with Joan of Arc\n##Civil wars between La Trémoille and Richemont's allies\n##Lifting of the siege of Lagny\n##Reduction of military commitments\n#Squandering of heritage\n#Criminal life\n##Occult involvement\n##Child murders\n##Act of force in Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte\n##Ecclesiastical and secular investigations\n##Trial and execution\n#Question of guilt\n##Doubts about the verdict in the Age of Enlightenment tradition\n##Occultist interpretations\n##Georges Bataille's interpretations\n##1992 mock re-trial\n##Contemporary academic views\n#Fictional portraits\n#Psychopathological interpretations\n##Fin de siècle portrayals\n##Classification as a serial killer\n#Gilles de Rais and the Bluebeard myth\n#Relationship with Joan of Arc\n#See also\n#References\n##Notes\n##Footnotes\n##Bibliography\n###Historical studies and literary scholarship\n###Essays\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The history of Christianity is a vast and complex topic that spans over two thousand years, with various periods and events that have shaped the faith into what it is today.\n\n**Early Christianity**\n\n**Jewish background**\n\nChristianity originated in Judaism, which was the dominant faith in the ancient Near East. The Hebrew Bible, also known as the Old Testament, contains the stories of the early Israelites and their relationship with God. The Jewish scriptures also include prophecies about a future messiah who would redeem Israel and bring salvation to the world. Jesus, who was born in Bethlehem around 4 BC, was seen as the fulfillment of these prophecies.\n\n**Apostolic Age (c. 30–100)**\n\nThe Apostolic Age is the period following the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, during which his followers, known as the apostles, spread his teachings and built the early Christian community. This period saw the development of the church structure, with the apostles as leaders and other followers as members.\n\n### **Developing church structure**\n\nThe early Christian church was organized around the apostles, who were seen as the leaders and teachers of the faith. The apostles chose other leaders, known as bishops, to help them with the work of spreading the gospel. The apostles also established a system of organization, with local churches led by bishops and other churches in the region reporting to a higher authority.\n\n### **Early growth**\n\nThe early Christian church grew rapidly, with many people in the Mediterranean region converting to the new faith. The apostles traveled extensively, preaching and teaching about Jesus and the possibility of salvation through faith in him. The church also developed a system of worship, with regular meetings for prayer, teaching, and celebration of the Lord's Supper.\n\n**Ante-Nicene period (100–312)**\n\nThe Ante-Nicene period saw the further development of Christian doctrine and the establishment of the church as a distinct institution. This period also saw the rise of various sects and controversies within the church, which would eventually lead to the formation of different denominations.\n\n### **Scripture**\n\nDuring this period, the New Testament canon was beginning to take shape, with various writings attributed to the apostles and other early Christians. The first Christian writings were likely oral traditions, passed down through generations before being written down. The earliest written accounts of the life of Jesus, such as the Gospel of Mark, date back to around 68-70 AD.\n\n### **Early Christian art**\n\nEarly Christian art often depicted the stories of the Bible in a symbolic and abstract manner. The use of images in worship and art was a way to convey spiritual truths and to emphasize the importance of the faith. The early Christian church also used art to identify sacred spaces, such as churches and baptisteries, with images and symbols.\n\n### **Persecutions and legalization**\n\nThe early Christian church faced persecution from the Roman Empire, with various emperors issuing edicts against the faith. However, in 313 AD, Emperor Constantine issued the Edict of Milan, which granted freedom of worship to Christians and marked the beginning of the end of persecution.\n\n**Spread of Christianity to c. 300 AD**\n\nThe spread of Christianity was a gradual process, with the faith spreading through personal contacts, trade, and travel. The apostles and other early Christians traveled extensively, preaching and teaching about Jesus and the possibility of salvation through faith in him.\n\n### **Inclusivity, women and exclusivity**\n\nThe early Christian church was inclusive, welcoming people from diverse backgrounds and social classes. Women played a significant role in the early church, with some even serving as apostles and leaders. However, the church also had exclusive practices, such as the requirement of baptism for membership.\n\n### **Moral practices**\n\nThe early Christian church emphasized moral practices, such as love, compassion, and generosity.

This marked a significant shift from the early period of persecution to one of official recognition and support.\n\n### **Christianity and polytheism**\n\nThe early Christian church faced challenges from polytheistic cults and practices, which emphasized the worship of multiple gods and goddesses. The church also faced challenges from other monotheistic faiths, such as Judaism.\n\n**Augustine's ethic toward Jews**\n\nAugustine, a prominent Christian theologian, developed an ethic toward Jews that emphasized the importance of tolerance and respect.

The election was triggered by the resignation of Prime Minister Liz Truss, who had become the second Conservative prime minister to resign in the space of a month.\n\n# Background\n\n## Boris Johnson premiership and scandals\n\nThe Conservative Party leadership election was the latest chapter in a tumultuous period for the party. The previous year had seen the premiership of Boris Johnson, who had become embroiled in a series of scandals, including the Partygate affair, in which he was accused of breaching COVID-19 lockdown rules. Johnson's premiership was also marked by controversy over the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, which had been negotiated by his predecessor, Theresa May.\n\n## Leadership election to succeed Johnson\n\nIn July 2022, Johnson announced that he would resign as prime minister, citing the need for a new leader to take the party forward. The Conservative Party's 1922 Committee, which is responsible for managing leadership elections, quickly got to work, announcing that a leadership election would be held. The election was contested by several candidates, including Liz Truss, who had been Chancellor of the Exchequer under Johnson.\n\n## Liz Truss premiership and scandals\n\nLiz Truss became the new prime minister in September 2022, following a surprise victory in the Conservative Party leadership election. However, her premiership was short-lived, marked by controversy over her tax policies, which were widely criticized as being too generous to the wealthy. Truss's premiership was also marked by controversy over the mini-budget, which was seen as too radical and too focused on cutting taxes.\n\n## Calls for Truss's resignation\n\nAs the days went by, Truss's popularity continued to slide, with many Conservative MPs calling for her to resign. The National Union of Students, which represents students in the UK, called for Truss to be sacked, citing her handling of the cost of living crisis. The Trades Union Congress, which represents trade unions in the UK, also called for Truss to resign, citing her failure to address the crisis.\n\n## Resignations and vote on fracking\n\nOn October 5, 2022, several Conservative MPs resigned from their positions, citing their disagreement with Truss's policies. The resignations were seen as a major blow to Truss's leadership, and many predicted that she would not survive the week. Meanwhile, a vote was held on fracking, which was seen as a major test of Truss's leadership. The vote was defeated, with many Conservative MPs voting against the policy.\n\n## Liz Truss resigns\n\nOn October 25, 2022, Liz Truss announced that she would resign as prime minister, citing her failure to deliver on her promises. Truss's resignation marked the end of her premiership, which had lasted just six weeks. She became the shortest-serving prime minister in British history.\n\n# Campaign\n\nThe Conservative Party leadership election campaign was a high-stakes affair, with several candidates vying for the top job. The campaign was marked by controversy over the party's policies, with many candidates accusing each other of being too right-wing or too left-wing. The campaign was also marked by controversy over the party's leadership, with many Conservative MPs calling for the election to be cancelled.\n\n# Election process\n\nThe Conservative Party leadership election process is complex and involves several stages.

The novel is a historical and philosophical epic that explores the intersection of aesthetics, politics, and spirituality in the context of fascist and socialist regimes. Written in the 1940s and published posthumously in 1979, the novel has received both critical acclaim and mixed reactions from scholars and readers worldwide.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance is a sprawling narrative that spans multiple continents and time periods. The story revolves around the lives of three working-class intellectuals, Walter Benjamin, Bertolt Brecht, and Georg Lukács, who are connected by their shared passion for aesthetics and politics. The novel is structured around their encounters and conversations, which unfold in a non-linear fashion, reflecting the authors' own experiences and reflections on the intersection of art and politics.\n\nThe narrative begins with the protagonists navigating the complexities of fascist and socialist regimes, grappling with the role of aesthetics in the face of ideological totalitarianism. As they move through the novel, they engage with a wide range of artistic and cultural expressions, from classical music to avant-garde art, from literature to cinema. The novel also explores the complexities of identity, class, and power, as the protagonists confront the challenges of living under regimes that seek to suppress individuality and creativity.\n\n# Form Features and Structure\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance is a highly experimental novel, blending elements of philosophy, history, and literature to create a unique narrative form. The novel is divided into three volumes, each of which explores a different aspect of the intersection of aesthetics and politics. The first volume focuses on the early 20th-century avant-garde movements, while the second volume explores the rise of fascist and socialist regimes. The third volume delves into the complexities of resistance and opposition under totalitarian regimes.\n\nThroughout the novel, Bonhoeffer employs a range of narrative techniques, from stream-of-consciousness to fragmented narratives, to convey the disjointed and fragmented nature of experience under regimes of oppression. The novel also incorporates a wide range of cultural and artistic references, from classical music to avant-garde art, from literature to cinema. These references serve to underscore the intersections between aesthetics and politics, highlighting the ways in which art and culture can be both a source of resistance and a tool of oppression.\n\n# History of Origins and Publication\n\n## Beginning\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance was written by Dietrich Bonhoeffer in the 1940s, during his time in prison for his involvement in the German resistance against the Nazi regime. Bonhoeffer was a prominent figure in the Confessing Church, a movement that sought to defy the Nazi regime's attempts to control the church. As he navigated the complexities of life under totalitarianism, Bonhoeffer began to grapple with the intersection of aesthetics and politics, exploring the ways in which art and culture could be used to resist and subvert regime.\n\n## Research\n\nBonhoeffer's research for the novel was extensive, drawing on a wide range of sources, from literary and philosophical texts to historical and cultural references. He was particularly drawn to the work of writers and artists who had been persecuted by the Nazi regime, such as Walter Benjamin and Bertolt Brecht. Bonhoeffer saw their work as a testament to the power of art to resist and subvert regime, and he sought to incorporate their ideas and influences into his own novel.\n\n## Writers Block\n\nDespite his extensive research and preparation, Bonhoeffer struggled with writers block throughout the composition of the novel. The pressures of living under a totalitarian regime, combined with the personal and emotional toll of his imprisonment, made it difficult for him to focus and create. Bonhoeffer's struggles with writers block are reflected in the novel itself, which is characterized by fragmented narratives and disjointed structures.\n\n## The Third Volume\n\nThe third volume of the novel, which explores the complexities of resistance and opposition under totalitarian regimes, was written by Bonhoeffer in the final months of his life. This volume is widely regarded as the most powerful and moving section of the novel, as Bonhoeffer grapples with the ultimate futility of resistance and the importance of holding onto hope and dignity in the face of oppression.\n\n## Sweden and the GDR\n\nAfter Bonhoeffer's death, the novel was smuggled out of Germany and published in Sweden in 1979. The novel quickly gained international attention, with scholars and readers praising its unique blend of philosophy, history, and literature. The novel was also widely discussed in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), where it was seen as a powerful critique of the regime's attempts to suppress individuality and creativity.\n\n## Other Translations\n\nSince its initial publication, the novel has been translated into numerous languages, including French, Spanish, Italian, and English. The novel has been widely praised for its unique narrative form and its exploration of the intersection of aesthetics and politics.\n\n# Textual Forms\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance is a highly experimental novel, blending elements of philosophy, history, and literature to create a unique narrative form. The novel is characterized by:\n\n* Fragmented narratives, reflecting the disjointed and fragmented nature of experience under regimes of oppression.\n* Stream-of-consciousness sections, conveying the inner lives and thoughts of the protagonists.\n* Incorporation of a wide range of cultural and artistic references, from classical music to avant-garde art, from literature to cinema.\n* Use of non-linear narrative structures, reflecting the complex and non-linear nature of historical events.\n\n# Artists and Artworks in the Novel\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance incorporates a wide range of artistic and cultural references, from classical music to avant-garde art, from literature to cinema. Some notable examples include:\n\n## Divine Comedy\n\nBonhoeffer was deeply influenced by Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, which he saw as a powerful exploration of the intersection of aesthetics and politics. The novel is characterized by a similar sense of moral and philosophical inquiry, as the protagonists navigate the complexities of fascist and socialist regimes.\n\n## Central Artworks\n\nSome of the central artworks that feature in the novel include:\n\n* The works of Walter Benjamin, including his famous essay \"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.\"\n* The works of Bertolt Brecht, including his plays and poems.\n* The works of Georg Lukács, including his book on aesthetics and politics.\n\n## Questions\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance raises a range of important questions about the intersection of aesthetics and politics, including:\n\n* How can art and culture be used to resist and subvert regime?\n* What role do aesthetics play in the face of ideological totalitarianism?\n* How can we hold onto hope and dignity in the face of oppression?\n\n# Reception\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance has received both critical acclaim and mixed reactions from scholars and readers worldwide.

The Lakota are a Native American tribe that traditionally resided in the Great Plains region of North America, primarily in present-day South Dakota, Montana, and North Dakota. The Lakota religion is deeply connected to the natural world, the spirits of the land, and the ancestors of the tribe. This article provides an overview of the Lakota religion, its beliefs, practices, and history.\n\n**Definition and Classification**\n\nThe Lakota religion is a traditional, animistic spirituality that is based on a deep connection with the natural world and the spirits that inhabit it. It is a collective, community-based spirituality that emphasizes the importance of respect, reciprocity, and balance in relationships with all living things. The Lakota religion is often classified as a form of shamanism, but this label is somewhat misleading, as it implies a more individualistic and isolated practice than is typical of Lakota spirituality.\n\n**Beliefs**\n\nLakota spirituality is centered on a complex web of relationships between the physical and spiritual worlds. At the heart of Lakota belief is a deep reverence for the sacred, which is seen as the source of all life and energy. This sacred force is embodied in various forms, including the sun, the moon, the earth, and the spirits of the land.\n\n### **Wakʽą and Wakʽą Tʽąką**\n\nWakʽą is the Lakota word for \"Great Spirit\" or \"Sacred Being.\" Wakʽą is seen as the ultimate source of all life and energy, and is often referred to as the \"Father\" of the Lakota people.

Kinship is an important concept in Lakota spirituality, where all living things are seen as interconnected and interdependent. The Lakota people have a deep reverence for the natural world, and believe that all living things are worthy of respect and reciprocity.\n\n### **Šicųpi and Wašicu**\n\nŠicųpi is the Lakota word for \"bad spirit\" or \"evil spirit.\" Šicųpi is seen as a malevolent force that is opposed to the sacred and the natural world.

These rituals and ceremonies are designed to maintain balance and harmony with the sacred and the natural world.\n\n### **Prayer and Offerings**\n\nPrayer and offerings are an important aspect of Lakota spirituality, where the Lakota people seek to communicate with the sacred and express gratitude for the blessings of life.

Launched in 2020, the compact has gained significant traction among publishers and has become a model for sustainable publishing practices.\n\n**Formation**\n\nThe SDG Publishers Compact was formed through a collaborative effort between the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the publishing industry. The initiative was conceived as a response to the growing awareness of the publishing industry's environmental and social impact. A group of pioneering publishers, led by the Swedish Publishers Association, came together to draft the compact's founding principles and guidelines.\n\nThe compact's formation marked a significant shift in the publishing industry's approach to sustainability. Gone are the days when publishers prioritized profit over people and the planet. The SDG Publishers Compact represents a new era of responsible publishing, where sustainability, inclusivity, and social responsibility are at the forefront of every decision.\n\n**Commitments**\n\nThe SDG Publishers Compact is built on a set of core commitments that guide its members in their pursuit of sustainability. These commitments are:\n\n1. **Climate action**: Publishers commit to reducing their carbon footprint and transitioning to carbon-neutral operations.\n2. **Social responsibility**: Publishers pledge to prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion in their operations, products, and services.\n3. **Digital transformation**: Publishers commit to embracing digital technologies to reduce waste, improve efficiency, and enhance the reader experience.\n4. **Supply chain management**: Publishers agree to work with suppliers who share their commitment to sustainability and responsible business practices.\n\n**Signatories**\n\nThe SDG Publishers Compact has attracted a diverse range of signatories from across the globe. Publishers from over 30 countries have joined the compact, representing a broad spectrum of languages, formats, and genres. Some notable signatories include:\n\n* The Swedish Publishers Association\n* The German Publishers and Booksellers Association\n* The French Publishers Association\n* The International Publishers Association (IPA)\n* The World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN-IFRA)\n\n**Fellows**\n\nThe SDG Publishers Compact has a network of fellows who play a crucial role in promoting the compact's mission and values. Fellows are experienced professionals from the publishing industry who have demonstrated a commitment to sustainability and social responsibility. They serve as ambassadors for the compact, providing guidance and support to members and helping to shape the compact's strategic direction.\n\n**Actions**\n\nThe SDG Publishers Compact is not just a statement of intent; it is a call to action. Members are expected to take concrete steps to implement the compact's commitments and guidelines. Some actions include:\n\n### **Discursive effects**\n\nThe SDG Publishers Compact has had a significant impact on the publishing industry's discourse.

The photograph has become an iconic image in American politics and culture, symbolizing Trump's reputation for controversy and defiance.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe mug shot was taken on June 16, 1972, after Trump was arrested along with several other protesters, including Michael Kennedy, the son of Robert F. Kennedy. The group had been demonstrating outside the U.S. District Court building in Manhattan, where a judge was presiding over a case involving a group of anti-war activists. Trump was charged with disorderly conduct, and the photograph was taken as part of the booking process.\n\n**Usage**\n\nThe mug shot has been widely used in various contexts, often to illustrate Trump's reputation for controversy and defiance.\n\n### Fundraising\n\nThe mug shot has been used by Trump's opponents in fundraising campaigns, with the image often appearing on buttons, stickers, and other campaign materials. In 2016, a group of Democrats created a series of fundraising emails featuring the mug shot, with the subject line \"The Original Donald Trump.\" The emails encouraged donors to contribute to the campaign by citing Trump's past behavior as a reason to support the Democratic candidate.\n\n### News coverage\n\nThe mug shot has been extensively used in news coverage of Trump, often to illustrate his reputation for controversy and defiance. In 2017, a New York Times article about Trump's early life included the mug shot, with the caption \"Donald Trump after his arrest in 1972.\" The article noted that Trump's arrest was one of several incidents that had raised questions about his character and behavior.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe mug shot has elicited a range of reactions from politicians, commentators, and the public.\n\n* Some have used the image to criticize Trump's behavior and to highlight his reputation for controversy and defiance.\n* Others have defended Trump, arguing that the mug shot is an unfair representation of his character and that he has since changed and grown as a person.\n* The image has also been used as a symbol of resistance and protest against Trump's policies and behavior, with many people displaying the mug shot as a way of expressing their opposition to his administration.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Donald Trump\n* Disorderly conduct\n* Protests in the United States\n* Controversies surrounding Donald Trump\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive overview of the mug shot of Donald Trump, including its background, usage, and reactions.

The film is an adaptation of William Shakespeare's play Hamlet, with the story transposed to 10th-century Iceland.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe Northman follows the story of Amleth, a young Viking prince who witnesses his father, King Aurvandil, being murdered by his uncle, King Fengi. Amleth is forced to flee and embark on a perilous journey to seek revenge against the king who betrayed and killed his father. Along the way, he encounters a slave woman named Olga, who becomes his love interest and guide. As Amleth draws closer to his goal, he must confront his own morality and the true nature of his quest for revenge.\n\nThe film's plot is heavily influenced by Norse mythology and Viking culture, with many references to the sagas and other literary works of the time.

The film's score was composed by Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough, with the duo using a combination of traditional and electronic instruments to create a unique and haunting soundtrack.\n\n## Music\n\nThe Northman features a unique and haunting soundtrack, composed by Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough. The score incorporates a combination of traditional and electronic instruments, including the use of the Viking-era instrument, the lyre. The soundtrack was released in conjunction with the film's theatrical release, and has since been praised by critics and audiences alike.\n\n# Marketing\n\n## Tie-in media\n\nThe Northman has spawned a range of tie-in media, including a companion novel, a video game, and a soundtrack album.
