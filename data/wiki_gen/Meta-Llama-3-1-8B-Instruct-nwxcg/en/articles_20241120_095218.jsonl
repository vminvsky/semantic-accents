It was established in 2011 and is contested by eight city-based franchises. The league is one of the most popular and successful domestic cricket competitions in the world, featuring some of the best players from Australia and around the globe.\n\n## History\n\nThe idea of a professional Twenty20 league in Australia was first proposed in 2009 by Cricket Australia, the governing body of cricket in the country. The league was designed to be a short-form version of the game, with each match lasting around three hours and featuring a reduced number of overs. The competition was initially intended to be a summer festival, with matches played from December to February.\n\n## Trophy\n\nThe trophy for the Big Bash League was designed by a competition held in 2011. The competition was restricted to Australian designers, with the final design chosen by the public from a field of three. The design was revealed on December 13, 2011.\n\n## Expansion Proposal\n\nIt had been proposed that the tournament would undergo expansion into more regional areas not supported by international cricket. The expansion was originally planned to be implemented in 2012, with the proposed teams including Newcastle, Canberra, Geelong, and Gold Coast. A New Zealand-based team was also mentioned as a possibility, which would be based at Auckland or Christchurch. However, this proposal was suspended due to the lack of proper cricket hosting facilities in the proposed cities.\n\n## Women's Big Bash League\n\nIn 2014, it was announced that a women's BBL would be established. The league was designed to be a women's version of the men's competition, with each match featuring a reduced number of overs and a shorter duration. The proposal was driven by the success of the men's competition, which had seen a significant increase in viewership and attendance.\n\n## Christmas Day Match\n\nIn 2015, Cricket Australia announced that they were looking into the possibility of hosting a Christmas Day BBL match. The proposal was met with excitement, with many fans expressing their desire to watch cricket on Christmas Day. If the proposal is passed, it would be a first in the history of Australian sport, with no professional matches having been played on Christmas Day in the past.\n\n## Tournament Format\n\nThe Big Bash League has undergone several format changes since its inception. The competition was initially contested by six state-based teams, but was later expanded to eight city-based franchises. The league features a double round-robin format, with each team playing the other seven teams twice. The top four teams then compete in a playoff series, with the winner of the final match declared the champion.\n\n## Champions League\n\nBefore 2014, the top two teams in the tournament used to qualify for the Champions League Twenty20 tournament. The Champions League was an annual international Twenty20 competition featuring the top domestic teams from various nations. However, the tournament was discontinued after its 2014 edition.\n\n## Current Teams\n\nThe Big Bash League features eight city-based franchises, each representing a different city in Australia. The teams are:\n\n* Adelaide Strikers\n* Brisbane Heat\n* Hobart Hurricanes\n* Melbourne Renegades\n* Melbourne Stars\n* Perth Scorchers\n* Sydney Sixers\n* Sydney Thunder\n\n## Rivalries\n\nThroughout the history of the tournament, rivalries have been formed by competition between teams and by teams being in the same city.

{"title": "William_the_Conqueror", "content": "\nBackground\nNorsemen first began raiding in what became Normandy in the late 8th century Permanent Scandinavian settlement occurred before 911, when Rollo, one of the Viking leaders, and King Charles the Simple of France reached an agreement ceding the county of Rouen to Rollo The lands around Rouen became the core of the later duchy of Normandy [4] Normandy may have been used as a base when Scandinavian attacks on England were renewed at the end of the 10th century, which would have worsened relations between England and Normandy [5] In an effort to improve matters, King Æthelred the Unready took Emma, sister of Richard II, Duke of Normandy, as his second wife in 1002 [6]\n\n\nEarly life\nWilliam was born in 1027 or 1028 at Falaise, Duchy of Normandy, most likely towards the end of 1028 [1] [9] [d] He was the only son of Robert I, son of Richard II [e] His mother, Herleva, was a daughter of Fulbert of Falaise, who may have been a tanner or embalmer [10] Herleva was possibly a member of the ducal household, but did not marry Robert [2] She later married Herluin de Conteville, with whom she had two sons – Odo of Bayeux and Count Robert of Mortain – and a daughter whose name is unknown [f] One of Herleva's brothers, Walter, became a supporter and protector of William during his minority [10] [g] Robert I also had a daughter, Adelaide, by another mistress [13]\n\n\nDuke of Normandy\nWilliam faced several challenges on becoming duke, including his illegitimate birth and his youth: he was either seven or eight years old [17] [18] [h] He enjoyed the support of his great-uncle, Archbishop Robert, as well as King Henry I of France, enabling him to succeed to his father's duchy [21] The support given to the exiled English princes in their attempt to return to England in 1036 shows that the new duke's guardians were attempting to continue his father's policies, [2] but Archbishop Robert's death in March 1037 removed one of William's main supporters, and Normandy quickly descended into chaos [21]\n\n\nChallenges\nWilliam faced several challenges on becoming duke, including his illegitimate birth and his youth: he was either seven or eight years old [17] [18] [h] He enjoyed the support of his great-uncle, Archbishop Robert, as well as King Henry I of France, enabling him to succeed to his father's duchy [21] The support given to the exiled English princes in their attempt to return to England in 1036 shows that the new duke's guardians were attempting to continue his father's policies, [2] but Archbishop Robert's death in March 1037 removed one of William's main supporters, and Normandy quickly descended into chaos [21]\n\n\nConsolidation of power\nWilliam's next efforts were against Guy of Burgundy, who retreated to his castle at Brionne, which William besieged After a long effort, the duke succeeded in exiling Guy in 1050 [32] To address the growing power of the Count of Anjou, Geoffrey Martel, [33] William joined with King Henry in a campaign against him, the last known cooperation between the two They succeeded in capturing an Angevin fortress but accomplished little else [34] Geoffrey attempted to expand his authority into the county of Maine, especially after the death of Hugh IV of Maine in 1051 Central to the control of Maine were the holdings of the Bellême family, who held Bellême on the border of Maine and Normandy, as well as the fortresses at Alençon and Domfront Bellême's overlord was the king of France, but Domfront was under the overlordship of Geoffrey Martel and Duke William was Alençon's overlord The Bellême family, whose lands were quite strategically placed between their three different overlords, were able to play each of them against the other and secure virtual independence for themselves [33]\n\n\nAppearance and character\nNo authentic portrait of William has been found; the contemporary depictions of him on the Bayeux Tapestry and on his seals and coins are conventional representations designed to assert his authority [50] There are some written descriptions of a burly and robust appearance, with a guttural voice He enjoyed excellent health until old age, although he became quite fat in later life [51] He was strong enough to draw bows that others were unable to pull and had great stamina [50] Geoffrey Martel described him as without equal as a fighter and horseman [52] Examination of William's femur, the only bone to survive when the rest of his remains were destroyed, showed he was approximately 5 feet 10 inches (1.78 m) tall [50]\n\n\nNorman administration\nNorman government under William was similar to the government that had existed under earlier dukes It was a fairly simple administrative system, built around the ducal household, [54] a group of officers including stewards, butlers, and marshals [55] The duke travelled constantly around the duchy, confirming charters and collecting revenues [56] Most of the income came from the ducal lands, as well as from tolls and a few taxes This income was collected by the chamber, one of the household departments [55]\n\n\nEnglish and continental concerns\nIn 1051 the childless King Edward of England appears to have chosen William as his successor [59] William was the grandson of Edward's maternal uncle, Richard II of Normandy [59]\n\n\nInvasion of England\nHarold was crowned on 6 January 1066 in Edward's new Norman-style Westminster Abbey, although some controversy surrounds who performed the ceremony English sources claim that Ealdred, the Archbishop of York, performed the ceremony, while Norman sources state that the coronation was performed by Stigand, who was considered a non-canonical archbishop by the papacy [73] Harold's claim to the throne was not entirely secure, as there were other claimants, perhaps including his exiled brother Tostig [74] [m] King Harald Hardrada of Norway also had a claim to the throne as the uncle and heir of King Magnus I, who had made a pact with Harthacnut around 1040 that if either Magnus or Harthacnut died without heirs, the other would succeed [78] The last claimant was William of Normandy, against whose anticipated invasion King Harold Godwinson made most of his preparations [74]\n\n\nHarold's preparations\nHarold was crowned on 6 January 1066 in Edward's new Norman-style Westminster Abbey, although some controversy surrounds who performed the ceremony English sources claim that Ealdred, the Archbishop of York, performed the ceremony, while Norman sources state that the coronation was performed by Stigand, who was considered a non-canonical archbishop by the papacy [73] Harold's claim to the throne was not entirely secure, as there were other claimants, perhaps including his exiled brother Tostig [74] [m] King Harald Hardrada of Norway also had a claim to the throne as the uncle and heir of King Magnus I, who had made a pact with Harthacnut around 1040 that if either Magnus or Harthacnut died without heirs, the other would succeed [78] The last claimant was William of Normandy, against whose anticipated invasion King Harold Godwinson made most of his preparations [74]\n\n\nWilliam's preparations\nWilliam of Poitiers describes a council called by Duke William, in which the writer gives an account of a debate between William's nobles and supporters over whether to risk an invasion of England Although some sort of formal assembly probably was held, it is unlikely that any debate took place: the duke had by then established control over his nobles, and most of those assembled would have been anxious to secure their share of the rewards from the conquest of England [79] William of Poitiers also relates that the duke obtained the consent of Pope Alexander II for the invasion, along with a papal banner The chronicler also claimed that the duke secured the support of Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and King Sweyn II of Denmark Henry was still a minor, however, and Sweyn was more likely to support Harold, who could then help Sweyn against the Norwegian king, so these claims should be treated with caution Although Alexander gave papal approval to the conquest after it succeeded, no other source claims papal support prior to the invasion [n] [80] Events after the invasion, which included the penance William performed and statements by later popes, lend circumstantial support to the claim of papal approval To deal with Norman affairs, William put the government of Normandy into the hands of his wife for the duration of the invasion [2]\n\n\nTostig and Hardrada's invasion\nTostig Godwinson and Harald Hardrada invaded Northumbria in September 1066 and defeated the local forces under Morcar and Edwin at the Battle of Fulford near York King Harold received word of their invasion and marched north, defeating the invaders and killing Tostig and Hardrada on 25 September at the Battle of Stamford Bridge [78] The Norman fleet finally set sail two days later, landing in England at Pevensey Bay on 28 September William then moved to Hastings, a few miles to the east, where he built a castle as a base of operations From there, he ravaged the interior and waited for Harold's return from the north, refusing to venture far from the sea, his line of communication with Normandy [81]\n\n\nBattle of Hastings\nAfter defeating Harald Hardrada and Tostig, Harold left much of his army in the north, including Morcar and Edwin, and marched the rest south to deal with the threatened Norman invasion [81] He probably learned of William's landing while he was travelling south Harold stopped in London for about a week before marching to Hastings, so it is likely that he spent about a week on his march south, averaging about 27 miles (43 kilometres) per day, [82] for the distance of approximately 200 miles (320 kilometres) [83] Although Harold attempted to surprise the Normans, William's scouts reported the English arrival to the duke The exact events preceding the battle are obscure, with contradictory accounts in the sources, but all agree that William led his army from his castle and advanced towards the enemy [84] Harold had taken a defensive position at the top of Senlac Hill (present-day Battle, East Sussex), about 6 miles (9.7 kilometres) from William's castle at Hastings [85]\n\n\nMarch on London\nWilliam may have hoped the English would surrender following his victory, but they did not Instead, some of the English clergy and magnates nominated Edgar the Ætheling as king, though their support for Edgar was only lukewarm After waiting a short while, William secured Dover, parts of Kent, and Canterbury, while also sending a force to capture Winchester, where the royal treasury was [94] These captures secured William's rear areas and his line of retreat to Normandy, if that was needed [2] William then marched to Southwark, across the Thames from London, which he reached in late November Next, he led his forces around the south and west of London, burning along the way He finally crossed the Thames at Wallingford in early December Stigand submitted to William there, and when the duke moved on to Berkhamsted soon afterwards, Edgar the Ætheling, Morcar, Edwin, and Ealdred also submitted William then sent forces into London to construct a castle; he was crowned at Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066 [94]\n\n\nConsolidation\nWilliam remained in England after his coronation and tried to reconcile the native magnates The remaining earls – Edwin (of Mercia), Morcar (of Northumbria), and Waltheof (of Northampton) – were confirmed in their lands and titles [95] Waltheof was married to William's niece Judith, daughter of his half-sister Adelaide, [96] and a marriage between Edwin and one of William's daughters was proposed Edgar the Ætheling also appears to have been given lands Ecclesiastical offices continued to be held by the same bishops as before the invasion, including the uncanonical Stigand [95] But the families of Harold and his brothers lost their lands, as did some others who had fought against William at Hastings [97] By March, William was secure enough to return to Normandy, but he took with him Stigand, Morcar, Edwin, Edgar, and Waltheof He left his half-brother Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux, in charge of England along with another influential supporter, William fitzOsbern, the son of his former guardian [95] Both men were also named to earldoms – fitzOsbern to Hereford (or Wessex) and Odo to Kent [2] Although he put two Normans in overall charge, he retained many of the native English sheriffs [97] Once in Normandy the new English king went to Rouen and the Abbey of Fecamp, [95] and then attended the consecration of new churches at two Norman monasteries [2]\n\n\nFirst actions\nWilliam remained in England after his coronation and tried to reconcile the native magnates The remaining earls – Edwin (of Mercia), Morcar (of Northumbria), and Waltheof (of Northampton) – were confirmed in their lands and titles [95] Waltheof was married to William's niece Judith, daughter of his half-sister Adelaide, [96] and a marriage between Edwin and one of William's daughters was proposed Edgar the Ætheling also appears to have been given lands Ecclesiastical offices continued to be held by the same bishops as before the invasion, including the uncanonical Stigand [95] But the families of Harold and his brothers lost their lands, as did some others who had fought against William at Hastings [97] By March, William was secure enough to return to Normandy, but he took with him Stigand, Morcar, Edwin, Edgar, and Waltheof He left his half-brother Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux, in charge of England along with another influential supporter, William fitzOsbern, the son of his former guardian [95] Both men were also named to earldoms – fitzOsbern to Hereford (or Wessex) and Odo to Kent [2] Although he put two Normans in overall charge, he retained many of the native English sheriffs [97] Once in Normandy the new English king went to Rouen and the Abbey of Fecamp, [95] and then attended the consecration of new churches at two Norman monasteries [2]\n\n\nEnglish resistance\nIn 1068 Edwin and Morcar rose in revolt, supported by Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria Orderic Vitalis states that Edwin's reason for revolting was that the proposed marriage between himself and one of William's daughters had not taken place, but another reason probably included the increasing power of fitzOsbern in Herefordshire, which affected Edwin's power within his own earldom The king marched through Edwin's lands and built Warwick Castle Edwin and Morcar submitted, but William continued on to York, building York and Nottingham Castles before returning south On his southbound journey, he began constructing Lincoln, Huntingdon, and Cambridge Castles William placed supporters in charge of these new fortifications – among them William Peverel at Nottingham and Henry de Beaumont at Warwick – then returned to Normandy late in 1068 [98]\n\n\nChurch affairs\nWhile at Winchester in 1070, William met with three papal legates – John Minutus, Peter, and Ermenfrid of Sion – who had been sent by the pope The legates ceremonially crowned William during the Easter court [101] The historian David Bates sees this coronation as the ceremonial papal \"seal of approval\" for William's conquest [2] The legates and the king then held a series of ecclesiastical councils dedicated to reforming and reorganising the English church Stigand and his brother, Æthelmær, the Bishop of Elmham, were deposed from their bishoprics Some of the native abbots were also deposed, both at the council held near Easter and at a further one near Whitsun The Whitsun council saw the appointment of Lanfranc as the new Archbishop of Canterbury, and Thomas of Bayeux as the new Archbishop of York, to replace Ealdred, who had died in September 1069 [101] William's half-brother Odo perhaps expected to be appointed to Canterbury, but William probably did not wish to give that much power to a family member [q] Another reason for the appointment may have been pressure from the papacy to appoint Lanfranc [102] Norman clergy were appointed to replace the deposed bishops and abbots, and at the end of the process, only native English bishops remained in office, along with several continental prelates appointed by Edward the Confessor [101] In 1070 William also founded Battle Abbey, a new monastery at the site of the Battle of Hastings, partly as a penance for the deaths in the battle and partly as a memorial to the dead [2] At an ecclesiastical council held in Lillebonne in 1080, he was confirmed in his ultimate authority over the Norman church [103]\n\n\nTroubles in England and on the Continent\nAlthough Sweyn had promised to leave England, he returned in early 1070, raiding along the Humber and East Anglia toward the Isle of Ely, where he joined up with Hereward the Wake, a local thegn Hereward's forces captured and looted Peterborough Abbey William was able to secure the departure of Sweyn and his fleet in 1070, [104] allowing him to return to the continent to deal with troubles in Maine, where the town of Le Mans had revolted in 1069 Another concern was the death of Count Baldwin VI of Flanders in July 1070, which led to a succession crisis as his widow, Richilde, was ruling for their two young sons, Arnulf and Baldwin Her rule was contested by Robert, Baldwin's brother Richilde proposed marriage to William fitzOsbern, who was in Normandy, and fitzOsbern accepted But after he was killed in February 1071 at the Battle of Cassel, Robert became count He was opposed to King William's power on the continent, thus the Battle of Cassel upset the balance of power in northern France and cost William an important supporter [105]\n\n\nDanish raids and rebellion\nAlthough Sweyn had promised to leave England, he returned in early 1070, raiding along the Humber and East Anglia toward the Isle of Ely, where he joined up with Hereward the Wake, a local thegn Hereward's forces captured and looted Peterborough Abbey William was able to secure the departure of Sweyn and his fleet in 1070, [104] allowing him to return to the continent to deal with troubles in Maine, where the

William an important supporter [105]\n\n\nRevolt of the Earls\nIn 1075, during William's absence, Ralph de Gael, the Earl of Norfolk, and Roger de Breteuil, the Earl of Hereford, conspired to overthrow William in the \"Revolt of the Earls\" [110] Ralph was at least part Breton and had spent most of his life prior to 1066 in Brittany, where he still had lands [113] Roger was a Norman, son of William fitzOsbern, but had inherited less authority than his father held [114] Ralph's authority seems also to have been less than his predecessors in the earldom, and this was likely the cause of his involvement in the revolt [113]\n\n\nTroubles at home and abroad\nEarl Ralph had secured control of the castle at Dol, and in September 1076 William advanced into Brittany and laid siege to the castle King Philip of France later relieved the siege and defeated William at the Battle of Dol in 1076, forcing him to retreat to Normandy Although this was William's first defeat in battle, it did little to change things An Angevin attack on Maine was defeated in late 1076 or 1077, with Count Fulk le Rechin wounded in the unsuccessful attack More serious was the retirement of Simon de Crépy, the Count of Amiens, to a monastery Before he became a monk, Simon handed his county of the Vexin over to King Philip The Vexin was a buffer state between Normandy and the lands of the French king, and Simon had been a supporter of William [s] William was able to make peace with Philip in 1077 and secured a truce with Count Fulk in late 1077 or early 1078 [116]\n\n\nLast years\nSources for William's actions between 1082 and 1084 are meagre According to the historian David Bates, this probably means that little of note happened, and that because William was on the continent, there was nothing for the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle to record [123] In 1082, William ordered the arrest of his half-brother Odo The exact reasons are unclear, as no contemporary author recorded what caused the quarrel between the half-brothers Orderic Vitalis later recorded that Odo had aspirations to become pope and that Odo had attempted to persuade some of William's vassals to join Odo in an invasion of southern Italy This would have been considered tampering with the king's authority over his vassals, which William would not have tolerated Although Odo remained in confinement for the rest of William's reign, his lands were not confiscated In 1083, William's son Robert rebelled once more with support from the French king A further blow was the death of Queen Matilda on 2 November 1083 William was always described as close to his wife, and her death would have added to his problems [124]\n\n\nWilliam as king\nAs part of his efforts to secure England, William ordered many castles, keeps, and mottes built – among them the central keep of the Tower of London, the White Tower These fortifications allowed Normans to retreat into safety when threatened with rebellion and allowed garrisons to be protected while they occupied the countryside The early castles were simple earth and timber constructions, later replaced with stone structures [127]\n\n\nChanges in England\nAs part of his efforts to secure England, William ordered many castles, keeps, and mottes built – among them the central keep of the Tower of London, the White Tower These fortifications allowed Normans to retreat into safety when threatened with rebellion and allowed garrisons to be protected while they occupied the countryside The early castles were simple earth and timber constructions, later replaced with stone structures [127]\n\n\nAdministration\nAfter 1066, William did not attempt to integrate his separate domains into one unified realm with one set of laws His seal from after 1066, of which six impressions still survive, was made for him after he conquered England and stressed his role as king, while separately mentioning his role as duke [t] When in Normandy, William acknowledged that he owed fealty to the French king, but in England no such acknowledgement was made – further evidence that the various parts of William's lands were considered separate The administrative machinery of Normandy, England, and Maine continued to exist separate from the other lands, with each one retaining its own forms For example, England continued the use of writs, which were not known on the continent Also, the charters and documents produced for the government in Normandy differed in formulas from those produced in England [133]\n\n\nDomesday Book\nAt Christmas 1085, William ordered the compilation of a survey of the landholdings held by himself and by his vassals throughout his kingdom, organised by counties It resulted in a work now known as the Domesday Book The listing for each county gives the holdings of each landholder, grouped by owners The listings describe the holding, who owned the land before the Conquest, its value, its tax assessment, and usually the number of peasants, ploughs, and any other resources the holding had Towns were listed separately All the English counties south of the River Tees and River Ribble are included The whole work seems to have been mostly completed by 1 August 1086, when the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that William received the results and that all the chief magnates swore the Salisbury Oath, a renewal of their oaths of allegiance [138] William's motivation in ordering the survey is unclear, but it probably had several purposes, such as making a record of feudal obligations and justifying increased taxation [2]\n\n\nDeath and aftermath\nWilliam left England towards the end of 1086 Following his arrival back on the continent he married his daughter Constance to Duke Alan of Brittany, in furtherance of his policy of seeking allies against the French kings William's son Robert, still allied with the French king, appears to have been active in stirring up trouble, enough so that William led an expedition against the French Vexin in July 1087 While seizing Mantes, William either fell ill or was injured by the pommel of his saddle [139] He was taken to the priory of Saint Gervase at Rouen, where he died on 9 September 1087 [2] Knowledge of the events preceding his death is confused because there are two different accounts Orderic Vitalis preserves a lengthy account, complete with speeches made by many of the principals, but this is likely more of an account of how a king should die than of what actually happened The other, the De obitu Willelmi, or On the Death of William, has been shown to be a copy of two 9th-century accounts with names changed [139]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe immediate consequence of William's death was a war between his sons Robert and William over control of England and Normandy [2] Even after the younger William's death in 1100 and the succession of his youngest brother Henry as king, Normandy and England remained contested between the brothers until Robert's capture by Henry at the Battle of Tinchebray in 1106 The difficulties over the succession led to a loss of authority in Normandy, with the aristocracy regaining much of the power they had lost to the elder William His sons also lost much of their control over Maine, which revolted in 1089 and managed to remain mostly free of Norman influence thereafter [143]\n\n\nFamily and children\nWilliam and his wife Matilda had at least nine children [49] The birth order of the sons is clear, but no source gives the relative order of birth of the daughters [2]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Introduction**\n\nWilliam the Conqueror, also known as William I of England, was a king of England and duke of Normandy who ruled from 1066 to 1087. He is known for his military conquest of England and the establishment of a new ruling class, which had a profound impact on the country's language, culture, and politics. William was a skilled military leader and strategist who was able to unite the warring factions of Normandy and lead a successful invasion of England.\n\n**Background**\n\nWilliam was born in 1027 or 1028 at Falaise, Duchy of Normandy, to Robert I, son of Richard II, and Herleva, a daughter of Fulbert of Falaise. His mother was possibly a member of the ducal household, but did not marry Robert. William was the only son of Robert, and his illegitimate birth posed a challenge to his succession to the duchy. Despite this, he was able to succeed his father as duke of Normandy due to the support of his great-uncle, Archbishop Robert, and King Henry I of France.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nWilliam faced several challenges on becoming duke, including his illegitimate birth and his youth. He was either seven or eight years old when he became duke. Despite these challenges, he was able to establish himself as a powerful leader in Normandy. The support given to the exiled English princes in their attempt to return to England in 1036 shows that the new duke's guardians were attempting to continue his father's policies.\n\n**Duke of Normandy**\n\nAs duke of Normandy, William's next efforts were against Guy of Burgundy, who retreated to his castle at Brionne, which William besieged. After a long effort, the duke succeeded in exiling Guy in 1050. To address the growing power of the Count of Anjou, Geoffrey Martel, William joined with King Henry in a campaign against him. They succeeded in capturing an Angevin fortress but accomplished little else.\n\n**Appearance and Character**\n\nNo authentic portrait of William has been found, but contemporary depictions of him on the Bayeux Tapestry and his seals and coins are conventional representations designed to assert his authority. There are some written descriptions of a burly and robust appearance, with a guttural voice. He was strong enough to draw bows that others were unable to pull and had great stamina.\n\n**Norman Administration**\n\nNorman government under William was similar to the government that had existed under earlier dukes. It was a fairly simple administrative system, built around the ducal household, with a group of officers including stewards, butlers, and marshals. The duke traveled constantly around the duchy, confirming charters and collecting revenues. Most of the income came from the ducal lands, as well as from tolls and a few taxes.\n\n**English and Continental Concerns**\n\nIn 1051, the childless King Edward of England appears to have chosen William as his successor. William was the grandson of Edward's maternal uncle, Richard II of Normandy. The English historian William of Poitiers describes William as the chosen successor of Edward, and William was likely aware of this when he began making plans for an invasion of England.\n\n**Invasion of England**\n\nWilliam's preparations for the invasion of England were extensive, and he assembled a large army of Norman knights and soldiers. The invasion took place in 1066, and William landed at Pevensey Bay in Sussex. He then marched to Hastings, where he was opposed by the English army led by King Harold Godwinson. The Battle of Hastings took place on October 14, 1066, and William's forces emerged victorious.\n\n**March on London**\n\nAfter the Battle of Hastings, William marched on London, which he reached in late November. He then led his forces around the south and west of London, burning along the way. He finally crossed the Thames at Wallingford in early December. Stigand submitted to William there, and when the duke moved on to Berkhamsted soon afterwards, Edgar the Ætheling, Morcar, Edwin, and Ealdred also submitted.\n\n**Consolidation**\n\nWilliam remained in England after his coronation and tried to reconcile the native magnates. The remaining earls – Edwin (of Mercia), Morcar (of Northumbria), and Waltheof (of Northampton) – were confirmed in their lands and titles. Waltheof was married to William's niece Judith, daughter of his half-sister Adelaide, and a marriage between Edwin and one of William's daughters was proposed.\n\n**Church Affairs**\n\nWhile at Winchester in 1070, William met with three papal legates who had been sent by the pope. The legates ceremonially crowned William during the Easter court. The legates and the king then held a series of ecclesiastical councils dedicated to reforming and reorganising the English church. Stigand and his brother, Æthelmær, the Bishop of Elmham, were deposed from their bishoprics.\n\n**Troubles in England and on the Continent**\n\nIn 1068, Edwin and Morcar rose in revolt, supported by Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria. The revolt was put down, but another rebellion took place in 1075, during William's absence from England. Ralph de Gael, the Earl of Norfolk, and Roger de Breteuil, the Earl of Hereford, conspired to overthrow William. The rebellion was put down, but William's authority was weakened.\n\n**Last Years**\n\nSources for William's actions between 1082 and 1084 are meagre, and it is likely that little of note happened during this period. In 1082, William ordered the arrest of his half-brother Odo, but the reasons for the quarrel between the half-brothers are unclear. In 1083, William's son Robert rebelled once more with support from the French king.\n\n**Death and Aftermath**\n\nWilliam died on September 9, 1087, at the priory of Saint Gervase at Rouen. His death led to a war between his sons Robert and William over control of England and Normandy. Even after the younger William's death in 1100 and the succession of his youngest brother Henry as king, Normandy and England remained contested between the brothers until Robert's capture by Henry at the Battle of Tinchebray in 1106.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nWilliam's legacy was profound, and his conquest of England changed the course of English history. He established a new ruling class in England, and his descendants went on to rule England for centuries. He also established a new system of government in England, which was based on feudalism.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"William_the_Conqueror\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nNorsemen first began raiding in what became Normandy in the late 8th century Permanent Scandinavian settlement occurred before 911, when Rollo, one of the Viking leaders, and King Charles the Simple of France reached an agreement ceding the county of Rouen to Rollo The lands around Rouen became the core of the later duchy of Normandy [4] Normandy may have been used as a base when Scandinavian attacks on England were renewed at the end of the 10th century, which would have worsened relations between England and Normandy [5] In an effort to improve matters, King Æthelred the Unready took Emma, sister of Richard II, Duke of Normandy, as his second wife in 1002 [6]\n\n\nEarly life\nWilliam was born in 1027 or 1028 at Falaise, Duchy of Normandy, most likely towards the end of 1028 [1] [9] [d] He was the only son of Robert I, son of Richard II [e] His mother, Herleva, was a daughter of Fulbert of Falaise, who may have been a tanner or embalmer [10] Herleva was possibly a member of the ducal household, but did not marry Robert [2] She later married Herluin de Conteville, with whom she had two sons – Odo of Bayeux and Count Robert of Mortain – and a daughter whose name is unknown [f] One of Herleva's brothers, Walter, became a supporter and protector of William during his minority [10] [g] Robert I also had a daughter, Adelaide, by another mistress [13]\n\n\nDuke of Normandy\nWilliam faced several challenges on becoming duke, including his illegitimate birth and his youth: he was either seven or eight years old [17] [18] [h] He enjoyed the support of his great-uncle, Archbishop Robert, as well as King Henry I of France, enabling him to succeed to his father's duchy [21] The support given to the exiled English princes in their attempt to return to England in 1036 shows that the new duke's guardians were attempting to continue his father's policies, [2] but Archbishop Robert's death in March 1037 removed one of William's main supporters, and Normandy quickly descended into chaos [21]\n\n\nChallenges\nWilliam faced several challenges on becoming duke, including his illegitimate birth and his youth: he was either seven

joined with King Henry in a campaign against him, the last known cooperation between the two They succeeded in capturing an Angevin fortress but accomplished little else [34] Geoffrey attempted to expand his authority into the county of Maine, especially after the death of Hugh IV of Maine in 1051 Central to the control of Maine were the holdings of the Bellême family, who held Bellême on the border of Maine and Normandy, as well as the fortresses at Alençon and Domfront Bellême's overlord was the king of France, but Domfront was under the overlordship of Geoffrey Martel and Duke William was Alençon's overlord The Bellême family, whose lands were quite strategically placed between their three different overlords, were able to play each of them against the other and secure virtual independence for themselves [33]\n\n\nAppearance and character\nNo authentic portrait of William has been found; the contemporary depictions of him on the Bayeux Tapestry and on his seals and coins are conventional representations designed to assert his authority [50] There are some written descriptions of a burly and robust appearance, with a guttural voice He enjoyed excellent health until old age, although he became quite fat in later life [51] He was strong enough to draw bows that others were unable to pull and had great stamina [50] Geoffrey Martel described him as without equal as a fighter and horseman [52] Examination of William's femur, the only bone to survive when the rest of his remains were destroyed, showed he was approximately 5 feet 10 inches (1.78 m) tall [50]\n\n\nNorman administration\nNorman government under William was similar to the government that had existed under earlier dukes It was a fairly simple administrative system, built around the ducal household, [54] a group of officers including stewards, butlers, and marshals [55] The duke travelled constantly around the duchy, confirming charters and collecting revenues [56] Most of the income came from the ducal lands, as well as from tolls and a few taxes This income was collected by the chamber, one of the household departments [55]\n\n\nEnglish and continental concerns\nIn 1051 the childless King Edward of England appears to have chosen William as his successor [59] William was the grandson of Edward's maternal uncle, Richard II of Normandy [59]\n\n\nInvasion of England\nHarold was crowned on 6 January 1066 in Edward's new Norman-style Westminster Abbey, although some controversy surrounds who performed the ceremony English sources claim that Ealdred, the Archbishop of York, performed the ceremony, while Norman sources state that the coronation was performed by Stigand, who was considered a non-canonical archbishop by the papacy [73] Harold's claim to the throne was not entirely secure, as there were other claimants, perhaps including his exiled brother Tostig [74] [m] King Harald Hardrada of Norway also had a claim to the throne as the uncle and heir of King Magnus I, who had made a pact with Harthacnut around 1040 that if either Magnus or Harthacnut died without heirs, the other would succeed [78] The last claimant was William of Normandy, against whose anticipated invasion King Harold Godwinson made most of his preparations [74]\n\n\nHarold's preparations\nHarold was crowned on 6 January 1066 in Edward's new Norman-style Westminster Abbey, although

Harthacnut died without heirs, the other would succeed [78] The last claimant was William of Normandy, against whose anticipated invasion King Harold Godwinson made most of his preparations [74]\n\n\nWilliam's preparations\nWilliam of Poitiers describes a council called by Duke William, in which the writer gives an account of a debate between William's nobles and supporters over whether to risk an invasion of England Although some sort of formal assembly probably was held, it is unlikely that any debate took place: the duke had by then established control over his nobles, and most of those assembled would have been anxious to secure their share of the rewards from the conquest of England [79] William of Poitiers also relates that the duke obtained the consent of Pope Alexander II for the invasion, along with a papal banner The chronicler also claimed that the duke secured the support of Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and King Sweyn II of Denmark Henry was still a minor, however, and Sweyn was more likely to support Harold, who could then help Sweyn against the Norwegian king, so these claims should be treated with caution Although Alexander gave papal approval to the conquest after it succeeded, no other source claims papal support prior to the invasion [n] [80] Events after the invasion, which included the penance William performed and statements by later popes, lend circumstantial support to the claim of papal approval To deal with Norman affairs, William put the government of Normandy into the hands of his wife for the duration of the invasion [2]\n\n\nTostig and Hardrada's invasion\nTostig Godwinson and Harald Hardrada invaded Northumbria in September 1066 and defeated the local forces under Morcar and Edwin at the Battle of Fulford near York King Harold received word of their invasion and marched north, defeating the invaders and killing Tostig and Hardrada on 25 September at the Battle of Stamford Bridge [78] The Norman fleet finally set sail two days later, landing in England at Pevensey Bay on 28 September William then moved to Hastings, a few miles to the east, where he built a castle as a base of operations From there, he ravaged the interior and waited for Harold's return from the north, refusing to venture far from the sea, his line of communication with Normandy [81]\n\n\nBattle of Hastings\nAfter defeating Harald Hardrada and Tostig, Harold left much of his army in the north, including Morcar and Edwin, and marched the rest south to deal with the threatened Norman invasion [81] He probably learned of William's landing while he was travelling south Harold stopped in London for about a week before marching to Hastings, so it is likely that he spent about a week on his march south, averaging about 27 miles (43 kilometres) per day, [82] for the distance of approximately 200 miles (320 kilometres) [83] Although Harold attempted to surprise the Normans, William's scouts reported the English arrival to the duke The exact events preceding the battle are obscure, with contradictory accounts in the sources, but all agree that William led his army from his castle and advanced towards the enemy [84] Harold had taken a defensive position at the top of Senlac Hill (present-day Battle, East Sussex), about 6 miles (9.7 kilometres) from William's castle at Hastings [85]\n\n\nMarch on London\nWilliam may have hoped the English would surrender following his victory, but they did not Instead, some of the English clergy and magnates nominated Edgar the Ætheling as king, though their support for Edgar was only lukewarm After waiting a short while, William secured Dover, parts of Kent, and Canterbury, while also sending a force to capture Winchester, where the royal treasury was [94] These captures secured William's rear areas and his line of retreat to Normandy, if that was needed [2] William then marched to Southwark, across the Thames from London, which he reached in late November Next, he led his forces around the south and west of London, burning along the way He finally crossed the Thames at Wallingford in early December Stigand submitted to William there, and when the duke moved on to Berkhamsted soon afterwards, Edgar the Ætheling, Morcar, Edwin, and Ealdred also submitted William then sent forces into London to construct a castle; he was crowned at Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066 [94]\n\n\nConsolidation\nWilliam remained in England after his coronation and tried to reconcile the native magnates The remaining earls – Edwin (of Mercia), Morcar (of Northumbria), and Waltheof (of Northampton) – were confirmed in their lands and titles [95] Waltheof was married to William's niece Judith, daughter of his half-sister Adelaide, [96] and a marriage between Edwin and one of William's daughters was proposed Edgar the Ætheling also appears to have been given lands Ecclesiastical offices continued to be held by the same bishops as before the invasion, including the uncanonical Stigand [95] But the families of Harold and his brothers lost their lands, as did some others who had fought against William at Hastings [97] By March, William was secure enough to return to Normandy, but he took with him Stigand, Morcar, Edwin, Edgar, and Waltheof He left his half-brother Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux, in charge of England along with another influential supporter, William fitzOsbern, the son of his former guardian [95] Both men were also named to earldoms – fitzOsbern to Hereford (or Wessex) and Odo to Kent [2] Although he put two Normans in overall charge, he retained many of the native English sheriffs [97] Once in Normandy the new English king went to Rouen and the Abbey of Fecamp, [95] and then attended the consecration of new churches at two Norman monasteries [2]\n\n\nFirst actions\nWilliam remained in England after his coronation and tried to reconcile the native magnates The remaining earls – Edwin (of Mercia), Morcar (of Northumbria), and Waltheof (of Northampton) – were confirmed in their lands and titles [95] Waltheof was married to William's niece Judith, daughter of his half-sister Adelaide, [96] and a

churches at two Norman monasteries [2]\n\n\nEnglish resistance\nIn 1068 Edwin and Morcar rose in revolt, supported by Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria Orderic Vitalis states that Edwin's reason for revolting was that the proposed marriage between himself and one of William's daughters had not taken place, but another reason probably included the increasing power of fitzOsbern in Herefordshire, which affected Edwin's power within his own earldom The king marched through Edwin's lands and built Warwick Castle Edwin and Morcar submitted, but William continued on to York, building York and Nottingham Castles before returning south On his southbound journey, he began constructing Lincoln, Huntingdon, and Cambridge Castles William placed supporters in charge of these new fortifications – among them William Peverel at Nottingham and Henry de Beaumont at Warwick – then returned to Normandy late in 1068 [98]\n\n\nChurch affairs\nWhile at Winchester in 1070, William met with three papal legates – John Minutus, Peter, and Ermenfrid of Sion – who had been sent by the pope The legates ceremonially crowned William during the Easter court [101] The historian David Bates sees this coronation as the ceremonial papal \"seal of approval\" for William's conquest [2] The legates and the king then held a series of ecclesiastical councils dedicated to reforming and reorganising the English church Stigand and his brother, Æthelmær, the Bishop of Elmham, were deposed from their bishoprics Some of the native abbots were also deposed, both at the council held near Easter and at a further one near Whitsun The Whitsun council saw the appointment of Lanfranc as the new Archbishop of Canterbury, and Thomas of Bayeux as the new Archbishop of York, to replace Ealdred, who had died in September 1069 [101] William's half-brother Odo perhaps expected to be appointed to Canterbury, but William probably did not wish to give that much power to a family member [q] Another reason for the appointment may have been pressure from the papacy to appoint Lanfranc [102] Norman clergy were appointed to replace the deposed bishops and abbots, and at the end of the process, only native English bishops remained in office, along with several continental prelates appointed by Edward the Confessor [101] In 1070 William also founded Battle Abbey, a new monastery at the site of the Battle of Hastings, partly as a penance for the deaths in the battle and partly as a memorial to the dead [2] At an ecclesiastical council held in Lillebonne in 1080, he was confirmed in his ultimate authority over the Norman church [103]\n\n\nTroubles in England and on the Continent\nAlthough Sweyn had promised to leave England, he returned in early 1070, raiding along the Humber and East Anglia toward the Isle of Ely, where he joined up with Hereward the Wake, a local thegn Hereward's forces captured and looted Peterborough Abbey William was able to secure the departure of Sweyn and his fleet in 1070, [104] allowing him to return to the continent to deal with troubles in Maine, where the town of Le Mans had revolted in 1069 Another concern was the death of Count Baldwin VI of Flanders in July 1070, which led to a succession crisis as his widow, Richilde, was ruling for their two young sons, Arnulf and Baldwin Her rule was contested by Robert, Baldwin's brother Richilde proposed marriage to William fitzOsbern, who was in Normandy, and fitzOsbern accepted But after he was killed in February 1071 at the Battle of Cassel, Robert became count He was opposed to King William's power on the continent, thus the Battle of Cassel upset the balance of power in northern France and cost William an important supporter [105]\n\n\nDanish raids and rebellion\nAlthough Sweyn had promised to leave England, he returned in early 1070, raiding along the Humber and East Anglia toward the Isle of Ely, where he joined up with Hereward the Wake, a local thegn Hereward's forces captured and looted Peterborough Abbey William was able to secure the departure of Sweyn and his fleet in 1070, [104] allowing him to return to the continent to deal with troubles in Maine, where the

William an important supporter [105]\n\n\nRevolt of the Earls\nIn 1075, during William's absence, Ralph de Gael, the Earl of Norfolk, and Roger de Breteuil, the Earl of Hereford, conspired to overthrow William in the \"Revolt of the Earls\" [110] Ralph was at least part Breton and had spent most of his life prior to 1066 in Brittany, where he still had lands [113] Roger was a Norman, son of William fitzOsbern, but had inherited less authority than his father held [114] Ralph's authority seems also to have been less than his predecessors in the earldom, and this was likely the cause of his involvement in the revolt [113]\n\n\nTroubles at home and abroad\nEarl Ralph had secured control of the castle at Dol, and in September 1076 William advanced into Brittany and laid siege to the castle King Philip of France later relieved the siege and defeated William at the Battle of Dol in 1076, forcing him to retreat to Normandy Although this was William's first defeat in battle, it did little to change things An Angevin attack on Maine was defeated in late 1076 or 1077, with Count Fulk le Rechin wounded in the unsuccessful attack More serious was the retirement of Simon de Crépy, the Count of Amiens, to a monastery Before he became a monk, Simon handed his county of the Vexin over to King Philip The Vexin was a buffer state between Normandy and the lands of the French king, and Simon had been a supporter of William [s] William was able to make peace with Philip in 1077 and secured a truce with Count Fulk in late 1077 or early 1078 [116]\n\n\nLast years\nSources for William's actions between 1082 and 1084 are meagre According to the historian David Bates, this probably means that little of note happened, and that because William was on the continent, there was nothing for the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle to record [123] In 1082, William ordered the arrest of his half-brother Odo The exact reasons are unclear, as no contemporary author recorded what caused the quarrel between the half-brothers Orderic Vitalis later recorded that Odo had aspirations to become pope and that Odo had attempted to persuade some of William's vassals to join Odo in an invasion of southern Italy This would have been considered tampering with the king's authority over his vassals, which William would not have tolerated Although Odo remained in confinement for the rest of William's reign, his lands were not confiscated In 1083, William's son Robert rebelled once more with support from the French king A further blow was the death of Queen Matilda on 2 November 1083 William was always described as close to his wife, and her death would have added to his problems [124]\n\n\nWilliam as king\nAs part of his efforts to secure England, William ordered many castles, keeps, and mottes built – among them the central keep of the Tower of London, the White Tower These fortifications allowed Normans to retreat into safety when threatened with rebellion and allowed garrisons to be protected while they occupied the countryside The early castles were simple earth and timber constructions, later replaced with stone structures [127]\n\n\nChanges in England\nAs part of his efforts to secure England, William ordered many castles, keeps, and mottes built – among them the central keep of the Tower of London, the White Tower These fortifications allowed Normans to retreat into safety when threatened with rebellion and allowed garrisons to be protected while they occupied the countryside The early castles were simple earth and timber constructions, later replaced with stone structures [127]\n\n\nAdministration\nAfter 1066, William did not attempt to integrate his separate domains into one unified realm with one set of laws His seal from after 1066, of which six impressions still survive, was made for him after he conquered England and stressed his role as king, while separately mentioning his role as duke [t] When in Normandy, William acknowledged that he owed fealty to the French king, but in England no such acknowledgement was made – further evidence that the various parts of William's lands were considered separate The administrative machinery of Normandy, England, and Maine continued to exist separate from the other lands, with each one retaining its own forms For example, England continued the use of writs, which were not known on the continent Also, the charters and documents produced for the government in Normandy differed in formulas from those produced in England [133]\n\n\nDomesday Book\nAt Christmas 1085, William ordered the compilation of a survey of the landholdings held by himself and by his vassals throughout his kingdom, organised by counties It resulted in a work now known as the Domesday Book The listing for each county gives the holdings of each landholder, grouped by owners The listings describe the holding, who owned the land before the Conquest, its value, its tax assessment, and usually the number of peasants, ploughs, and any other resources the holding had Towns were listed separately All the English counties south of the River Tees and River Ribble are included The whole work seems to have been mostly completed by 1 August 1086, when the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that William received the results and that all the chief magnates swore the Salisbury Oath, a renewal of their oaths of allegiance [138] William's motivation in ordering the survey is unclear, but it probably had several purposes, such as making a record of feudal obligations and justifying increased taxation [2]\n\n\nDeath and aftermath\nWilliam left England towards the end of 1086 Following his arrival back on the continent he married his daughter Constance to Duke Alan of Brittany, in furtherance of his policy of seeking allies against the French kings William's son Robert, still allied with the French king, appears to have been active in stirring up trouble, enough so that William led an expedition against the French Vexin in July 1087 While seizing Mantes, William either fell ill or was injured by the pommel of his saddle [139] He was taken to the priory of Saint Gervase at Rouen, where he died on 9 September 1087 [2] Knowledge of the events preceding his death is confused because there are two different accounts Orderic Vitalis preserves a lengthy account, complete with speeches made by many of the principals, but this is likely more of an account of how a king should die than of what actually happened The other, the De obitu Willelmi, or On the Death of William, has been shown to be a copy of two 9th-century accounts with names changed [139]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe immediate consequence of William's death was a war between his sons Robert and William over control of England and Normandy [2] Even after the younger William's death in 1100 and the succession of his youngest brother Henry as king, Normandy and England remained contested between the brothers until Robert's capture by Henry at the Battle of Tinchebray in 1106 The difficulties over the succession led to a loss of authority in Normandy, with the aristocracy regaining much of the power they had lost to the elder William His sons also lost much of their control over Maine, which revolted in 1089 and managed to remain mostly free of Norman influence thereafter [143]\n\n\nFamily and children\nWilliam and his wife Matilda had at least nine children [49] The birth order of the sons is clear, but no source gives the relative order of birth of the daughters

{"title": "French_Open", "content": "\nHistory\nOfficially named in French Internationaux de France de Tennis (\"French Internationals of Tennis\" in English), [8] [9] the tournament uses the name Roland-Garros [d] in all languages, [11] and it is usually called the French Open in English [12]\n\n\nExpansion\nFrom 2004 to 2008, plans were developed to build a covered stadium with a roof, as complaints continued over delayed matches [23] [24] [25] Various proposals were put forward to expand the facility or to move the tournament to a completely new, 55-court venue outside of Paris city limits In 2011 the decision was taken to maintain the tournament within its existing venue [26] [27] The expansion project called for a new stadium to be built alongside the historical Auteuil's greenhouses and expansion of old stadiums and the tournament village [28] A wide-ranging project to overhaul the venue was presented in 2011, including building a roof over Court Philippe-Chatrier, demolishing and replacing Court No 1 with a grassy hill for outdoors viewing, and geographical extension of the venue eastward into the Jardin des Serres d'Auteuil [29]\n\n\nSurface characteristics\nThe French Open has been the only major played on clay courts since 1978, when the US Open changed to hard courts [40] [41] Clay courts slow down the ball and produce a high bounce when compared with grass courts or hard courts [citation needed] For this reason, clay courts take away some of the advantages of big servers and serve-and-volleyers, which makes it hard for these types of players to dominate on the surface [citation needed] For example, Pete Sampras, known for his huge serve and who won 14 Grand Slam titles, never won the French Open – his best result was reaching the semi-finals in 1996 Many other notable players have won multiple Grand Slam events but have never won the French Open, including John McEnroe, Frank Sedgman, John Newcombe, Venus Williams, Stefan Edberg, Boris Becker, Lleyton Hewitt, Andy Murray, Jimmy Connors, Louise Brough, Virginia Wade and Martina Hingis; McEnroe and Edberg lost their only French Open finals appearances in five sets.\n\n\nComposition of the courts\n1 Red brick dust.\n2 Crushed white limestone.\n3 Clinker (coal residue).\n4 Crushed gravel.\n5 Drain rock.\n\n\nTrophies, prize money and rankings points\nThe trophies have been awarded to the winners since 1953 and are manufactured by Mellerio dits Meller, a famous Parisian jewelry house They are all made of pure silver with finely etched decorations on their side Each new singles winner gets his or her name written on the base of the trophy Winners receive custom-made pure silver replicas of the trophies they have won [43] They are usually presented by the President of the French Tennis Federation (FFT).\n\n\nPrize money\nFor 2024, the prize money pool was announced to be €53.478 million, an increase of 7.82% compared to the prize pool for 2023 edition [46] [47]\n\n\nRankings points\nMen and women often receive point values based on the rules of their respective tours.\n\n\nSenior points\n\n\n\nChampions\nFrance

window (U.S time) matches to ESPN for broadcast by ESPN2 from 2007 through 2015 [54] In August 2015, ESPN announced that it would discontinue its sub-licensing and drop coverage of the French Open beginning in 2016, with network staff citing that because of the structure of the arrangement, its coverage \"did not fit our successful model at the other three Majors\"—where ESPN is the exclusive rightsholder [54] Rather than find another partner to sub-license coverage to, Tennis Channel chose to retain the rights under its new owner Sinclair Broadcast Group, nearly doubling the amount of

The tournament is one of the four Grand Slam events in the tennis calendar and is considered one of the most prestigious titles in the sport.\n\n# History\n\nThe French Open has a rich history dating back to 1891, when it was first held at the Stade Français in Paris. The tournament was initially known as the Internationaux de France de Tennis, but was later renamed Roland-Garros in honor of the French aviator Roland Garros. The tournament has been held at its current location in the Bois de Boulogne since 1928.\n\nIn its early years, the French Open was dominated by French players, who won 19 of the first 20 titles. However, in the 1920s, the tournament began to attract players from other countries, and by the 1930s, the competition had become more international. The tournament was suspended during World War II, but resumed in 1946.\n\nIn 1978, the French Open became the first Grand Slam tournament to be played on clay courts, which has become a distinctive feature of the tournament. The slow-playing surface has made the French Open a challenging event for players who rely on powerful serves and aggressive playing styles.\n\n# Expansion\n\nOver the years, the French Open has undergone several expansions and renovations. In the 1980s, the tournament added new courts and facilities, including a retractable roof over Court Philippe Chatrier. In the 2000s, the tournament underwent a major renovation, which included the construction of a new stadium and the expansion of the tournament village.\n\nIn 2011, the French Open announced plans to expand the tournament venue, which would include the construction of a new stadium and the demolition of Court No 1. The expansion project was designed to improve the tournament's infrastructure and provide a more modern and comfortable experience for players and spectators.\n\n# Surface Characteristics\n\nThe French Open is played on clay courts, which are made from a mixture of red brick dust, crushed white limestone, clinker (coal residue), crushed gravel, and drain rock. The slow-playing surface of the clay courts makes the French Open a challenging event for players who rely on powerful serves and aggressive playing styles.\n\nThe clay courts also produce a high bounce, which can make it difficult for players to control their shots. As a result, the French Open has become a favorite among players who have a strong all-around game and can adapt to the challenging conditions.\n\n# Composition of the Courts\n\nThe courts at the French Open are made from a combination of materials, including:\n\n* Red brick dust: This is the primary component of the clay courts, providing a smooth and even surface for players to play on.\n* Crushed white limestone: This material is added to the clay courts to provide a more durable and long-lasting surface.\n* Clinker (coal residue): This material is used to add texture and traction to the clay courts.\n* Crushed gravel: This material is used to provide additional traction and stability to the clay courts.\n* Drain rock: This material is used to allow water to drain from the clay courts, preventing the surface from becoming too slippery.\n\n# Trophies, Prize Money, and Rankings Points\n\nThe French Open awards trophies to the winners of the tournament, which are manufactured by Mellerio dits Meller, a famous Parisian jewelry house. The trophies are made of pure silver and feature finely etched decorations on their side.\n\nWinners of the French Open receive custom-made pure silver replicas of the trophies they have won. The trophies are usually presented by the President of the French Tennis Federation (FFT).\n\nThe prize money for the French Open has increased significantly over the years, with the 2024 tournament offering a prize money pool of €53.478 million. The prize money is distributed among the players based on their performance in the tournament, with the winner receiving the largest share.\n\nPlayers who participate in the French Open also earn rankings points, which are used to determine their position in the world rankings. The rankings points are awarded based on the players' performance in the tournament, with the winner earning the most points.\n\n# Champions\n\nThe French Open has been won by some of the greatest tennis players of all time, including Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic. These players have dominated the tournament in recent years, with Nadal winning a record 13 titles and Federer winning 5 titles.\n\nNadal's success at the French Open is particularly notable, as he has won the tournament a record 13 times. He has also held the number one spot in the world rankings for a record 275 weeks, making him one of the most dominant players in the history of tennis.\n\n# Former Champions\n\nSome of the greatest tennis players of all time have won the French Open in the past, including:\n\n* Rod Laver: Laver won the French Open in 1962 and 1969, and is widely considered one of the greatest tennis players of all time.\n* Bjorn Borg: Borg won the French Open in 1974, 1975, and 1980, and is widely considered one of the greatest tennis players of all time.\n* John McEnroe: McEnroe won the French Open in 1984, and is widely considered one of the greatest tennis players of all time.\n* Martina Navratilova: Navratilova won the French Open in 1978, 1979, 1982, 1984, 1985, and 1986, and is widely considered one of the greatest tennis players of all time.\n\n# Current Champions\n\nThe current champions of the French Open are:\n\n* Men's Singles: Rafael Nadal\n* Women's Singles: Iga Swiatek\n* Men's Doubles: Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos\n* Women's Doubles: Barbora Krejcikova and Katerina Siniakova\n\n# Most Recent Finals\n\nThe most recent finals of the French Open were:\n\n* Men's Singles: Novak Djokovic vs Stefanos Tsitsipas\n* Women's Singles: Iga Swiatek vs Sofia Kenin\n* Men's Doubles: Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos vs Ivan Dodig and Filip Polasek\n* Women's Doubles: Barbora Krejcikova and Katerina Siniakova vs Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Iga Swiatek\n\n# Records\n\nSome of the records set at the French Open include:\n\n* Most titles won: Rafael Nadal (13)\n* Most consecutive titles: Rafael Nadal (5)\n* Most titles won by a man: Rafael Nadal (13)\n* Most titles won by a woman: Chris Evert (7)\n* Most consecutive finals appearances: Rafael Nadal (10)\n\n# Broadcasting and Streaming\n\nThe French Open is broadcast in many countries around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and India.

English), [8] [9] the tournament uses the name Roland-Garros [d] in all languages, [11] and it is usually called the French Open in English [12]\n\n\nExpansion\nFrom 2004 to 2008, plans were developed to build a covered stadium with a roof, as complaints continued over delayed matches [23] [24] [25] Various proposals were put forward to expand the facility or to move the tournament to a completely new, 55-court venue outside of Paris city limits In 2011 the decision was taken to maintain the tournament within its existing venue [26] [27] The expansion project called for a new stadium to be built alongside the historical Auteuil's greenhouses and expansion of old stadiums and the tournament village [28] A wide-ranging project to overhaul the venue was presented in 2011, including building a roof over Court Philippe-Chatrier, demolishing and replacing Court No 1 with a grassy hill for outdoors viewing, and geographical extension of the venue eastward into the Jardin des Serres d'Auteuil [29]\n\n\nSurface characteristics\nThe French Open has been the only major played on clay courts since 1978, when the US Open changed to hard courts [40] [41] Clay courts slow down the ball and produce a high bounce when compared with grass courts or hard courts [citation needed] For this reason, clay courts take away some of the advantages of big servers and serve-and-volleyers, which makes it hard for these types of players to dominate on the surface [citation needed] For example, Pete Sampras, known for his huge serve and who won 14 Grand Slam titles, never won the French Open – his best result was reaching the semi-finals in 1996 Many other notable players have won multiple Grand Slam events but have never won the French Open, including John McEnroe, Frank Sedgman, John Newcombe, Venus Williams, Stefan Edberg, Boris Becker, Lleyton Hewitt, Andy Murray, Jimmy Connors, Louise Brough, Virginia Wade and Martina Hingis; McEnroe and Edberg lost their only French Open finals appearances in five sets.\n\n\nComposition of the courts\n1 Red brick dust.\n2 Crushed white limestone.\n3 Clinker (coal residue).\n4 Crushed gravel.\n5 Drain rock.\n\n\nTrophies, prize money and rankings points\nThe trophies have been awarded to the winners since 1953 and are manufactured by Mellerio dits Meller, a famous Parisian jewelry house They are all made of pure silver with finely etched decorations on their side Each new singles winner gets his or her name written on the base of the trophy Winners receive custom-made pure silver replicas of the trophies they have won [43] They are usually presented by the President of the French Tennis Federation (FFT).\n\n\nPrize money\nFor 2024, the prize money pool was announced to be €53.478 million, an increase of 7.82% compared to the

window (U.S time) matches to ESPN for broadcast by ESPN2 from 2007 through 2015 [54] In August 2015, ESPN announced that it would discontinue its sub-licensing and drop coverage of the French Open beginning in 2016, with network staff citing that because of the structure of the arrangement, its coverage \"did not fit our successful model at the other three Majors\"—where ESPN is the exclusive

{"title": "Tor_missile_system", "content": "\nDevelopment\nThe development of the Tor missile system started on 4 February 1975, in response to the directives of the Central Committee of the CPSU Initiated as a successor to the 9K33 Osa (NATO reporting name SA-8 \"Gecko\"), development of the land based version was conducted in parallel with the naval variant of the system (3K95 Kinzhal/SA-N-9 \"Gauntlet\"), to be installed on a number of upcoming ship classes, including the Kirov-class battlecruisers, [3] and retrofitted onto older ships Responsibility for development was given to the Antey design bureau (headed by V.P Efremov), the missiles designed by MKB Fakel (under P.D Grushin) and the Altair design bureau (headed by S.A Fadeyev) was responsible for the development of Kinzhal [3] All the developers and manufacturers of the Tor missile system unified into Almaz-Antey in 2002 [8]\n\n\nCharacteristics\nThe closest foreign equivalent to the Tor, in function and operation, are systems like the British Rapier missile and French Crotale missile systems, which some consider to have somewhat less performance [11] [12] [13] than Tor (the other two systems being based on older equipment) All three systems are mobile and self-propelled, Tor using the 9A330 combat vehicle, which carries a crew of four (one driver, three operators), and acts as an autonomous Transporter, Launcher, And Radar unit, or TLAR (similar to but not a TELAR, as it does not erect the missile to a launch position) The 9A330 is based on the GM-355 chassis manufactured by MMZ, the Tor-M1 using the improved GM-5955 [14] It is equipped with NBC (nuclear, biological and chemical) protection Like Rapier and Crotale, in addition to the tracked vehicle, there are also static and towed versions of the Tor, as well as a wheeled one Mobility time is 3 minutes and it can be transported by any transport means (including aerial) The reaction time of the original Tor is 7–8 (standard) / 7–10 (if it is in motion) seconds [5]\n\n\nDescription\nThe closest foreign equivalent to the Tor, in function and operation, are systems like the British Rapier missile and French Crotale missile systems, which some

transported by any transport means (including aerial) The reaction time of the original Tor is 7–8 (standard) / 7–10 (if it is in motion) seconds [5]\n\n\nTLAR features\nArranged in a similar fashion to the previous 9K33 Osa (Russian: «Оса») and 9K22 Tunguska (Russian: «Тунгуска») air defense systems, Tor's TLAR features a turret with a top mounted target acquisition radar, and frontal tracking radar, with 8 ready to fire missiles stored vertically between the two radars The target acquisition radar is an F band pulse doppler 3D radar, equipped with a truncated parabolic antenna, and a mechanically, later electronically, scanned in azimuth with a 32 degree sector view, [15] and has an average power output of 1.5 kW, which provides a maximum detection range of 25 kilometres (16 mi) For reference, a McDonnell Douglas F-15 at an altitude of 6 km has a detection probability of 0.8 at this range [3] The electronic 'heart' of the system is a digital fire control system, which allows detection of up to 48 targets and the tracking of ten at any one time, and integrates IFF functionality; the IFF antenna being mounted above the search radar [citation needed]\n\n\nRadar\nThe target engagement radar is a G band/H band (later K band) pulse doppler radar with an (in azimuth) passive electronically scanned array antenna The radar is classed as a thinned array (design using fewer elements) incorporating only 570 phase shifters and uses linear polarization [15] The radar has an average power output of 0.6 kW providing a maximum detection range of 20 km/12 mi An F-15 type aircraft had a detection probability of 0.8 at this range [3] Originally Tor could only engage one target at a time, and with only two of its missiles Later variants of the Tor system (Tor-M1 and M2E) incorporate additional fire control channels, as well as improved fire control computers, allowing the system to engage two (M1) and then four (M2E) targets, while simultaneously guiding up to four (M1) and then eight (M2E) missiles There is also a small antenna on the top of the target engagement radar to communicate with missiles after launch [citation needed] Together these radars carry the NATO reporting name \"Scrum Half\" [16] To reduce the dimensions of the vehicle, the target acquisition radar can be folded down horizontally when travelling, and the tracking radar can partially rotate away from vertical [citation needed] To allow engagements in an ECM-heavy environment, the Tor missile system is equipped with an optical tracking system, complementing the main radar [16]\n\n\nMobility\nAs a fully mobile system, the Tor is capable of acquiring and tracking targets while the TLAR is moving Due to the interference with launch operations while in motion, missiles can be fired only when the system is stationary Once set up, the reaction time (from target detection to engagement) is described as 5–8 seconds, depending on the variant; however, reaction time is somewhat longer (around 10 seconds) while in motion and firing in short halts To facilitate this mode of operation, an auxiliary power unit (APU) is fitted so that the main engine can be shut down while the radar and missile system continue to operate when stationary, enabling long periods of readiness The digital computers allowed for a higher degree of automation than any previous Soviet system of its type Target threat classification is automatic and the system can be operated with little operator input, if desired [citation needed]\n\n\nTypical deployment\nTypically, a battery of four Tor vehicles is accompanied by the mobile Ranzhir-M (Russian: \"Ранжир-М\") command center, which provides automatic interaction with the Tor, 9K33 Osa, 9K31 Strela-1, 2K22 Tunguska It allows for efficient allocation of tasks between the individual Tor-M1 crews and allows each TLAR to be linked into a wider air defense system, thereby increasing target detection range and reducing reaction time.\n\n\nMissiles\nThe rockets were developed for the interception of small, aggressively maneuvering targets [4]\n\n\nVariants\nThe project was given strict design specifications to meet; Tor had to provide extended detection and tracking of fast, low radar cross section targets and be capable of quickly and efficiently dealing with massed air raids, while providing a high degree of automation and integration with other air defence assets [21]\nTo meet these demanding specifications, the designers used a variety of new technologies, including advanced passive electronically scanned array radar for improved detection and tracking performance, enhanced digital information processing, and vertically launched missiles to improve reaction time and increase the number of readily available munitions After testing and evaluation between December 1983 and December 1984, the land-based system was accepted into service on 19 March 1986 [22]\n\n\n9K330 Tor\nThe project was given strict

(0.93 mi), minimum height 10 metres (33 ft) [23]\n\n\n9K332 Tor-M2E\nUpgrades have continued over the lifetime of the system, with developer Almaz Antey unveiling the newest incarnation of the Tor missile system, the Tor-M2E, [28] at the MAKS Airshow in 2007.\n\n\nTor-M1-2U\n\"Tor-M1-2U\" entered service at the end of 2012 This system is designed to destroy aircraft, helicopters, UAVs, missiles, and other precision guided weapons, flying at medium, low and very low altitudes in all weather The system is able to engage four targets simultaneously at a height of up to 10 kilometers Its crew consists of three people.\n [41] [42] Deliveries are underway [43] It can hit targets on the move, [44] at a speed of up to 25 km/h (includes all the necessary functions for independent fight) [45]\n\n\n3K95 Kinzhal (naval variant)\nThe 3K95 \"Kinzhal\" (Russian: Кинжал – dagger) is the naval version of the Tor missile system developed by Altair and has the NATO reporting name SA-N-9 Gauntlet Using the same 9M330 missile as the land based version, the system can be mounted on vessels displacing over 800 tonnes and is known to be installed on Kuznetsov-class aircraft carriers, Kirov-class multimission cruisers, Udaloy-class anti-submarine destroyers and Neustrashimy-class frigates The naval version of the later Tor-M1 is known as the \"Yozh\" (Russian: Ёж – hedgehog), while the export version of the Kinzhal is known as \"Klinok\" (Russian: Клинок – blade).\n\n\nTor-M2KM\nThe Tor-M2 km is a self-contained fighting module version of the system that can be mounted in various locations In October 2016, it was loaded onto the helipad of the Admiral Grigorovich frigate by means of an ordinary wharf crane and fixed in position with steel chains to fire at simulated cruise missiles while the ship was underway This could give advanced SAM capabilities to vessels without the capacity to install the larger and heavier Kinzhal system; it can also be mounted on a truck, building roof, or any horizontal surface at least 2.5 m wide and 7.1 m long The module weighs 15 tons and contains all equipment needed to operate without any external support It can go from standby to full alert in 3 minutes and acquire 144 air targets while simultaneously tracking the 20 most dangerous ones marked for priority by the two-man crew The Tor-M2 km missiles have a range of 15 km [citation needed] In June 2022, it was installed on the helipad of the Vasily Bykov patrol boat The system uses the new 9M331M surface-to-air missiles [48] According to a Russian source, the system is being installed as of November 2023 on large landing ships of the Black Sea Fleet [49]\n\n\nTor-M2DT\nThe system is especially designed to be used for Arctic region at temperatures up to −50 degrees °C based on the chassis of the DT-30PM tracked all-terrain vehicle and is capable of detecting over 40 air targets, especially high-precision weapons, and to track and engage up to four of them simultaneously at a range of up to 12 km and altitudes up to 10 km with its 16 missiles even on the move Its creation was completed in 2018 and the first delivery of 12 systems was held in November of the same year [50] [51] [52] It was deployed in Ukraine in December 2022, with at least two systems being destroyed by Ukrainian artillery using M982 Excalibur shells by 3 February 2023 along with a DT-30 [53] [54] [55]\n\n\nTor-E2\nJSC Rosoboronexport, part of the Rostec State Corporation, has started promoting the newest Tor-E2 SAM system developed and produced by the Almaz-Antey Air and Space Defence Concern in 2018 Tor-E2 combat vehicle is an independent, mobile, all-terrain fighting unit that provides detection and identification of air targets on the march and at the halt, target lock-on and engagement at the halt, from a short stop and on the move A battery of the four-channel Tor-E2 SAM systems, consisting of four combat vehicles, can simultaneously engage up to 16 targets flying from any direction at a range of at least 15 km and an altitude of up to 12 km Each vehicle carries 16 missiles, twice as many as the previous version of the Tor system In addition, the two Tor-E2 combat vehicles can operate in the \"link\" mode, which enables them to exchange information about the air situation at different altitude ranges and coordinate joint engagement operations In this mode, one of the combat vehicles, acting from an ambush, receives information from the other one and does not reveal itself until the launch of the missile A command post can be attached to a battery of four Tor-E2 combat vehicles to control and coordinate the Tor combat vehicles and interact with the customer's air defense control system [56]\n\n\nHQ-17 (Chinese variant)\nThe HQ-17 is a Chinese development of the Tor-M1 system with a new chassis, IFF array, radar, and other electronics [57]\n\n\nFM-2000\nThe FM-2000 is a mobile short-range air-defence (SHORAD) system unveiled by

TEL [59] It is a version of the HQ-17 [citation needed]\n\n\nCombat history\nIn a press conference regarding the 2008 South Ossetia War, Russian defence ministry spokesperson Anatoliy Nogovitsyn speculated about the use of the Tor missile system by Georgian Armed Forces against attacking Russian aircraft suggesting it as a possible cause of the loss of a Tu-22MR strategic bomber, shot down by Georgian air-defences while on a reconnaissance mission during the conflict [60] Following analysis attributed the loss of the bomber to Georgian Buk-M1 system, [61] which Georgia obtained from Ukraine in 2007 [62]\n\n\nRusso-Georgian War (2008)\nIn a press conference regarding the 2008 South Ossetia War, Russian defence ministry spokesperson Anatoliy Nogovitsyn speculated about the use of

War\nSince 30 September 2015, Russian military forces have been directly involved in the Syrian Civil War.\nAs part of the air defense, Tor-M2, along with the Pantsir-S1 point air defense system, has been deployed  at the Khmeimim Air Base, allegedly, on multiple occasions proving to be superior to the Pantsir-S1 in countering UAV swarm attacks, the vehicles destroyed more than 45 improvised UAVs as of June 2020 [63] [64]\n\n\nShoot-down of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752\nOn 9 January 2020 it was reported by Newsweek that U.S officials believed Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was shot down by an Iranian Tor-M1 missile, probably by accident [66] Later that day, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that there was credible allied and Canadian intelligence that an Iranian surface-to-air missile likely caused the loss of the Ukrainian airliner He would not elaborate further on the intelligence [67] Eliot Higgins of Bellingcat tweeted photographs of a Tor nose section with its distinctive canards, claimed to be taken at the crash site [68] [69] On 11 January 2020, Iran admitted that it had shot down the Ukrainian airliner due to human error but Iran didn't close the air space because of war situation, [70] and on 20 January, Iran's Civil Aviation Organization confirmed that \"two Tor-M1 missiles  [...] were fired at the aircraft.\" [71]\n\n\n2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War\nOn 9 November 2020, the Azerbaijan Ministry of Defence published a video showing the destruction of an Armenian Tor-M2 km system in the vicinity of Khojavend [73] A drone tracked the vehicle as it parked inside a garage where it was subsequently struck by an IAI Harop \"kamikaze\" drone and multiple guided bombs.\n\n\n2022 Russo-Ukrainian War\nIn 2022, Tor missiles are being

the naval variant of the system (3K95 Kinzhal/SA-N-9 \"Gauntlet\"), to be installed on a number of upcoming ship classes, including the Kirov-class battlecruisers, [3] and retrofitted onto older ships Responsibility for development was given to the Antey design bureau (headed by V.P Efremov), the missiles designed by MKB Fakel (under P.D Grushin) and the Altair design bureau (headed by S.A Fadeyev) was responsible for the development of Kinzhal [3] All the developers and manufacturers of the Tor missile system unified into Almaz-Antey in 2002 [8]\n\n\nCharacteristics\nThe closest foreign equivalent to the Tor, in function and operation, are systems like the British Rapier missile and French Crotale missile systems, which some consider to have somewhat less performance [11] [12] [13] than Tor (the other two systems being based on older equipment) All three systems are mobile and self-propelled, Tor using the 9A330 combat vehicle, which carries a crew of four (one driver, three operators), and acts as an autonomous Transporter, Launcher, And Radar unit, or TLAR (similar to but not a TELAR, as it does not erect the missile to a launch position) The 9A330 is based on the GM-355 chassis manufactured by MMZ, the Tor-M1 using the improved GM-5955 [14] It is equipped with NBC (nuclear, biological and chemical) protection Like Rapier and Crotale, in addition to the tracked vehicle, there are also static and towed versions of the Tor, as well as a wheeled one Mobility time is 3 minutes and it can be transported by any transport means (including aerial) The reaction time of the original Tor is 7–8 (standard) / 7–10 (if it is in motion) seconds [5]\n\n\nDescription\nThe closest foreign equivalent to the Tor, in function and operation, are systems like the British

wheeled one Mobility time is 3 minutes and it can be transported by any transport means (including aerial) The reaction time of the original Tor is 7–8 (standard) / 7–10 (if it is in motion) seconds [5]\n\n\nTLAR features\nArranged in a similar fashion to the previous 9K33 Osa (Russian: «Оса») and 9K22 Tunguska (Russian: «Тунгуска») air defense systems, Tor's TLAR features a turret with a top mounted target acquisition radar, and frontal tracking radar, with 8 ready to fire missiles stored vertically between the two radars The target acquisition radar is an F band pulse doppler 3D radar, equipped with a truncated parabolic antenna, and a mechanically, later electronically, scanned in azimuth with a 32 degree sector view, [15] and has an average power output of 1.5 kW, which provides a maximum detection range of 25 kilometres (16 mi) For reference, a McDonnell Douglas F-15 at an altitude of 6 km has a detection probability of 0.8 at this range [3] The electronic 'heart' of the system is a digital fire control system, which allows detection of up to 48 targets and the tracking of ten at any one time, and integrates IFF functionality; the IFF antenna being mounted above the search radar [citation needed]\n\n\nRadar\nThe target engagement radar is a G band/H band (later K band) pulse doppler radar with an (in azimuth) passive electronically scanned array antenna The radar is classed as a thinned array (design using fewer elements) incorporating only 570 phase shifters and uses linear polarization [15] The radar has an average power output of 0.6 kW providing a maximum detection range of 20 km/12 mi An F-15 type aircraft had a detection probability of 0.8 at this range [3] Originally Tor could only engage one target at a time, and with only two of its missiles Later variants of the Tor system (Tor-M1 and M2E) incorporate additional fire control channels, as well as improved fire control computers, allowing the system to engage two (M1) and then four (M2E) targets, while simultaneously guiding up to four (M1) and then eight (M2E) missiles There is also a small antenna on the top of the target engagement radar to communicate with missiles after launch [citation needed] Together these radars carry the NATO reporting name \"Scrum Half\" [16] To reduce the dimensions of the vehicle, the target acquisition radar can be folded down horizontally when travelling, and the tracking radar can partially rotate away from vertical [citation needed] To allow engagements in an ECM-heavy environment, the Tor missile system is equipped with an optical tracking system, complementing the main radar [16]\n\n\nMobility\nAs a fully mobile system, the Tor is capable of acquiring and tracking targets while the TLAR is moving Due to the interference with launch operations while in motion, missiles can be fired only when the system is stationary Once set up, the reaction time (from target detection to engagement) is described as 5–8 seconds, depending on the variant; however, reaction time is somewhat longer (around 10 seconds) while in motion and firing in short halts To facilitate this mode of operation, an auxiliary power unit (APU) is fitted so that the main engine can be shut down while the radar and missile system continue to operate when stationary, enabling long periods of readiness The digital computers allowed for a higher degree of automation than any previous Soviet system of its type Target threat classification is automatic and the system can be operated with little operator input, if desired [citation needed]\n\n\nTypical deployment\nTypically, a battery of four Tor vehicles is accompanied by the mobile Ranzhir-M (Russian: \"Ранжир-М\") command center, which provides automatic interaction with the Tor, 9K33 Osa, 9K31 Strela-1, 2K22 Tunguska It allows for efficient allocation of tasks between the individual Tor-M1 crews and allows each TLAR to be linked into a wider air defense system, thereby increasing target detection range and reducing reaction time.\n\n\nMissiles\nThe rockets were developed for the interception of small, aggressively maneuvering targets [4]\n\n\nVariants\nThe project was given strict design specifications to meet; Tor had to provide extended detection and tracking of fast, low radar cross section targets and be capable of quickly and efficiently dealing with massed air raids, while providing a high degree of automation and integration with other air defence assets [21]\nTo meet these demanding specifications, the designers used a variety of new technologies, including advanced passive electronically scanned array radar for improved detection and tracking performance, enhanced digital information processing, and vertically launched missiles to improve reaction time and increase the number of readily available munitions After testing and evaluation between December 1983 and December 1984, the land-based system was accepted into service on 19 March 1986 [22]\n\n\n9K330 Tor\nThe project was given strict design specifications to meet; Tor had to provide extended detection and tracking of fast, low radar cross section targets and be capable of quickly and efficiently dealing with massed air raids, while providing a high degree of automation and integration with other air defence assets [21]\nTo meet these demanding specifications, the designers used a variety of new technologies, including advanced passive electronically scanned array radar for improved detection and tracking performance, enhanced digital information processing, and vertically launched missiles to improve reaction time and increase the number of readily available munitions After testing and evaluation between December 1983 and December 1984, the land-based system was accepted into service on 19 March 1986 [22]\n\n\n9K331 Tor-M1\n\"Tor-M1\", introduced in 1991 with the 9M331 missile, with greatly improved missile accuracy [5] and the ability to engage two targets simultaneously, minimum range 1.5 km (0.93 mi), minimum height 10 metres (33 ft) [23]\n\n\n9K332 Tor-M2E\nUpgrades have continued over the lifetime of the system, with developer Almaz Antey unveiling the newest incarnation of the Tor missile system, the Tor-M2E, [28] at the MAKS Airshow in 2007.\n\n\nTor-M1-2U\n\"Tor-M1-2U\" entered service at the end of 2012 This system is designed to destroy aircraft, helicopters, UAVs, missiles, and other precision guided weapons, flying at medium, low and very low altitudes in all weather The system is able to engage four targets simultaneously at a height of up to 10 kilometers Its crew consists of three people.\n [41] [42] Deliveries are underway [43] It can hit targets on the move, [44] at a speed of up to 25 km/h (includes all the necessary functions for independent fight) [45]\n\n\n3K95 Kinzhal (naval variant)\nThe 3K95 \"Kinzhal\" (Russian: Кинжал – dagger) is the naval version of the Tor missile system developed by Altair and has the NATO reporting name SA-N-9 Gauntlet Using the same 9M330 missile as the land based version, the system can be mounted on vessels displacing over 800 tonnes and is known to be installed on Kuznetsov-class aircraft carriers, Kirov-class multimission cruisers, Udaloy-class anti-submarine destroyers and Neustrashimy-class frigates The naval version of the later Tor-M1 is known as the \"Yozh\" (Russian: Ёж – hedgehog), while the export version of the Kinzhal is known as \"Klinok\" (Russian: Клинок – blade).\n\n\nTor-M2KM\nThe Tor-M2 km is a self-contained fighting module version of the system that can be mounted in various locations In October 2016, it was loaded onto the helipad of the Admiral Grigorovich frigate by means of an ordinary wharf crane and fixed in position with steel chains to fire at simulated cruise missiles while the ship was underway This could give advanced SAM capabilities to vessels without the capacity to install the larger and heavier Kinzhal system; it can also be mounted on a truck, building roof, or any horizontal surface at least 2.5 m wide and 7.1 m long The module weighs 15 tons and contains all equipment needed to operate without any external support It can go from standby to full alert in 3 minutes and acquire 144 air targets while simultaneously tracking the 20 most dangerous ones marked for priority by the two-man crew The Tor-M2 km missiles have a range of 15 km [citation needed] In June 2022, it was installed on the helipad of the Vasily Bykov patrol boat The system uses the new 9M331M surface-to-air missiles [48] According to a Russian source, the system is being installed as of November 2023 on large landing ships of the Black Sea Fleet [49]\n\n\nTor-M2DT\nThe system is especially designed to be used for Arctic region at temperatures up to −50 degrees °C based on the chassis of the DT-30PM tracked all-terrain vehicle and is capable of detecting over 40 air targets, especially high-precision weapons, and to track and engage up to four of them simultaneously at a range of up to 12 km and altitudes up to 10 km with its 16 missiles even on the move Its creation was completed in 2018 and the first delivery of 12 systems was held in November of the same year [50] [51] [52] It was deployed in Ukraine in December 2022, with at least two systems being destroyed by Ukrainian artillery using M982 Excalibur shells by 3 February 2023 along with a DT-30 [53] [54] [55]\n\n\nTor-E2\nJSC Rosoboronexport, part of the Rostec State Corporation, has started promoting the newest Tor-E2 SAM system developed and produced by the Almaz-Antey Air and Space Defence Concern in 2018 Tor-E2 combat vehicle is an independent, mobile, all-terrain fighting unit that provides detection and identification of air targets on the march and at the halt, target lock-on and engagement at the halt, from a short stop and on the move A battery of the four-channel Tor-E2 SAM systems, consisting of four combat vehicles, can simultaneously engage up to 16 targets flying from any direction at a range of at least 15 km and an altitude of up to 12 km Each vehicle carries 16 missiles, twice as many as the previous version of the Tor system In addition, the two Tor-E2 combat vehicles can operate in the \"link\" mode, which enables them to exchange information about the air situation at different altitude ranges and coordinate joint engagement operations In this mode, one of the combat vehicles, acting from an ambush, receives information from the other one and does not reveal itself until the launch of the missile A command post can be attached to a battery of four Tor-E2 combat vehicles to control and coordinate the Tor combat vehicles and interact with the customer's air defense control system [56]\n\n\nHQ-17 (Chinese variant)\nThe HQ-17 is a Chinese development of the Tor-M1 system with a new chassis, IFF array, radar, and other electronics [57]\n\n\nFM-2000\nThe FM-2000 is a mobile short-range air-defence (SHORAD) system unveiled by China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation at the 2018 Zhuhai Airshow and in service as of 2019 [citation needed] Its range is 15 km and engagement altitude is 10 km It is carried on a 3 axle TEL [59] It is a version of the HQ-17 [citation needed]\n\n\nCombat history\nIn a press conference regarding the 2008 South Ossetia War, Russian defence ministry spokesperson Anatoliy Nogovitsyn speculated about the use of the Tor missile system by Georgian Armed Forces against attacking Russian aircraft suggesting it as a possible cause of the loss of a Tu-22MR strategic bomber, shot down by Georgian air-defences while on a reconnaissance mission during the conflict [60] Following analysis attributed the loss of the bomber to Georgian Buk-M1 system, [61] which Georgia obtained from Ukraine in 2007 [62]\n\n\nRusso-Georgian War (2008)\nIn a press conference regarding the 2008 South Ossetia War, Russian defence ministry spokesperson Anatoliy Nogovitsyn speculated about the use of the Tor missile system by Georgian Armed Forces against attacking Russian aircraft suggesting it as a possible cause of the loss of a Tu-22MR strategic bomber, shot down by Georgian air-defences while on a reconnaissance mission during the conflict [60] Following analysis attributed the loss of the bomber to Georgian Buk-M1 system, [61] which Georgia obtained from Ukraine in 2007 [62]\n\n\nSyrian War\nSince 30 September 2015, Russian military forces have been directly involved in the Syrian Civil War.\nAs part of the air defense, Tor-M2, along with the Pantsir-S1 point air defense system, has been deployed  at the Khmeimim Air Base, allegedly, on multiple occasions proving to be superior to the Pantsir-S1 in countering UAV swarm attacks, the vehicles destroyed more than 45 improvised UAVs as of June 2020 [63] [64]\n\n\nShoot-down of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752\nOn 9 January 2020 it was reported by Newsweek that U.S officials believed Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was shot down by an Iranian Tor-M1 missile, probably by accident [66] Later that day, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that there was credible allied and Canadian intelligence that an Iranian surface-to-air missile likely caused the loss of the Ukrainian airliner He would not elaborate further on the intelligence [67] Eliot Higgins of Bellingcat tweeted photographs of a Tor nose section with its distinctive canards, claimed to be taken at the crash site [68] [69] On 11 January 2020, Iran admitted that it had shot down the Ukrainian airliner due to human error but Iran didn't close the air space because of war situation, [70] and on 20 January, Iran's Civil Aviation Organization confirmed that \"two Tor-M1 missiles  [...] were fired at the aircraft.\" [71]\n\n\n2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War\nOn 9 November 2020, the Azerbaijan Ministry of Defence published a video showing the destruction of an Armenian Tor-M2 km system in the vicinity of Khojavend [73] A drone tracked the vehicle as it parked inside a garage where it was subsequently struck by an IAI Harop \"kamikaze\" drone and multiple guided bombs.\n\n\n2022 Russo-Ukrainian War\nIn 2022, Tor missiles are being used by the Russian armed forces during its invasion of Ukraine Several systems were reportedly abandoned by the Russian army

that went down to the final day [70] Arsenal finished the season in second place, only a point less than the first Arsenal was the only WSL team to proceed to the knockout stage in the 2021–22 UEFA Women's Champions League.\n\n\n2022: WSL all-time second-most goal contributions and ACL injury\nIn October 2022, after her successful UEFA Women's Euro 2022 campaign, Mead revealed it was her mother's terminal ovarian cancer diagnosis in summer 2021 that fuelled her acclaimed performance last season She said, \"It made me look at life a lot differently My mum's now having a lot of her life taken away from her from this disease I don't think you can waste time anymore worrying about things that are not worth worrying about.\" When the family was unsure if she would even be alive by the time Mead played in a home Euros, Mead made the conscious decision to \"strip it all back\" and just go out and play with freedom and youthful abandon She said, \"My motivation was my mum … I wanted to make her proud I wanted to make her happy.\" [97] She said that she had spent all year \"trying to put a smile on my mum's face.\" [98]\n\n\n2023–24: Return from ACL injury\nOn 15 October 2023, Mead made her return after an 11-month period on the sidelines, coming on as a substitute for Noelle Maritz in the 87th minute of Arsenal's WSL match against Aston Villa Arsenal were trailing 0–1, but

[9] The word kippurim 'atonement' is one of many Biblical Hebrew words which, while using a grammatical plural form, refers to a singular abstract concept [6]\n\n\nIn the Torah\nThe Torah calls the day Yom HaKippurim (יוֹם הַכִּיפּוּרִים‎), and decrees fasting (\"affliction of the soul\") and a strict prohibition of work on the tenth day of the seventh month, later known as Tishrei [12] The laws of Yom Kippur are commanded by God to Moses in three passages in the Torah:\n\n\nTemple service\nWhen the Temple in Jerusalem stood, Yom Kippur was the occasion of an elaborate sacrificial service, as commanded by Leviticus 16 The rabbis summarized the laws of this service in Mishnah tractate Yoma, and they appear in contemporary traditional Jewish prayer books for Yom Kippur, and are studied as part of a traditional Jewish Yom Kippur worship service [18] The Mussaf prayer on Yom Kippur includes a section known as the Avodah, where a poem is recited describing this Temple service.\n\n\nSignificance\nYom Kippur is one of the two High Holy Days, or Days of Awe (Hebrew yamim noraim), alongside Rosh Hashanah (which falls nine days previously) [19] According to Jewish tradition, on Rosh Hashanah God inscribes each person's fate for the coming year into the Book of Life, and waits until Yom Kippur to \"seal\" the verdict [20] This process is described dramatically in the poem Unetanneh Tokef, which is recited on Rosh Hashanah in the Ashkenazic and Italian rites and on Yom Kippur in the Eastern Ashkenazic and Italian rites:\n\n\nHigh Holy Days\nYom Kippur is one

consists of regretting having committed the sin, resolving not to commit that sin in the future, and confessing that sin before God [21]\n\n\nThirteen attributes\nAccording to the Bible, after the golden calf sin, Moses descended from Mount Sinai and broke the Tablets of Stone, which contained the Ten Commandments and symbolized the covenant with God [26] After God agreed to forgive the people's sin, Moses was told to return to Mount Sinai for a second 40-day period, in order to receive a second set of tablets [27] According to rabbinic tradition, the date Moses descended with the second set of tablets was Yom Kippur On this day Moses announced to the people that they had been forgiven; as a result the Torah fixed this date as a permanent holiday of forgiveness [28] [29] [30]\n\n\nCloseness to God\nWhile many of the observances of Yom Kippur (such as fasting and long prayers) can be difficult, there is also a tradition in which they are interpreted positively, as indications of closeness of God Various sources compare the observances of Yom Kippur – fasting, barefootness (not wearing leather shoes), standing (in prayer), particular manners of prayer, even the peace that exists between Jews on this day – with the behavior of angels, suggesting that on Yom Kippur Jews become like angels in heaven, purified and close to God and not limited by physicality [33]

Jewish sinners do not also participate is not a valid fast\" [59]\n\n\nCustoms\nOn the day preceding Yom Kippur, known as Erev Yom Kippur (lit 'eve  [of] day  [of] atonement'), a number of activities are customarily performed in preparation for Yom Kippur These activities generally relate to the themes of the holiday, but are forbidden or impractical to do on Yom Kippur itself.\n\n\nErev Yom

nafshoteichem) on Yom Kippur [71] While these verses do not explicitly mention the form of affliction, the phrase \"afflicting oneself\" frequently appears elsewhere in connection with fasting or lack of food, [72] and public fast days for repentance were a common practice in Biblical times [73] According to the Jewish oral tradition, the Yom Kippur \"affliction\" consists of the following five prohibitions: [74]\n\n\nSymbolism\nA number of different interpretations of these restrictions have been suggested.\n\n\nProhibition on work\nThe Torah calls Yom Kippur a day of rest (shabbat shabbaton) on which work is prohibited [90] Thus, the activities forbidden on Shabbat are also forbidden on Yom Kippur: the 39 categories of work as well as the rabbinic Shabbat prohibitions [91]\n\n\nOther observances\nWearing white clothing is traditional to symbolize one's purity on this day [92] Various reasons have been suggested for this custom:\n\n\nBreaking of the fast\nFollowing the fast, Sephardic Jewish communities traditionally serve a drink made from melon seeds similar to the Turkish sübye [98] [99] Turkish Jews refer to it as subiye, while Greek Jews call it pepitada [100] This is followed by coffee with milk and biscochos (savory ring-shaped cookies), pieces of bread dipped in olive oil and za'atar alongside tomato, and later, chicken cooked with dry quinces or plums [99]\n\n\nPrayer services\nThe Yom Kippur prayer service includes several unique aspects One is the number of prayer services Unlike a regular day which has three prayer services (Shacharit, Mincha, and Maariv), or a Shabbat or Yom Tov which has four prayer services (those three, plus Mussaf), Yom Kippur has five prayer services (those four, plus Ne'ila, the closing prayer) [101] The prayer services also include private and public confessions of sins (Vidui), [20] and a unique prayer dedicated to the special Yom Kippur avodah (service) of the Kohen Gadol (high priest) in the Holy Temple in Jerusalem [102] The Yom Kippur prayer services include additional poems (piyyutim) and petitions for forgiveness (selichot) Notable poems recited include Avinu Malkeinu, Unetanneh Tokef (in Eastern Ashkenazic and Italian communities), Ki Anu Amecha (in Ashkenazic communities, although the order of the verses varies between communities), the Ten Martyrs (in Eastern Ashkenazic and some Western Ashkenazic communities), HaAderet v'HaEmunah (in Ashkenazic communities), and Mareh Kohen (in Ashkenazic communities) If Yom Kippur falls on Shabbat, Avinu Malkeinu is recited by Ashkenazic only during the Ne'ila prayer service, whereas the Sephardic and Italian rite recite it as normal at Shacharit and Mincha.\n\n\nOrder of prayers\nBefore the beginning of Yom Kippur, many Jews recite the optional Tefillah Zakkah ('the pure prayer'), in which (among other topics) one declares that they forgive anyone who has harmed them in the past, \"except for damages which can be recovered in court, and except for those who say: I will harm him and he will forgive me\", asks God not to punish anyone who has been so forgiven, and asks God to show similar graciousness in forgiving their own sins [106]\n\n\nKol Nidre\nBefore sunset on Yom Kippur eve, worshipers gather in the synagogue The cantor stands with two community members at his sides, and chants the Kol Nidre prayer (Aramaic: כל נדרי, English translation: 'All vows')  It is recited in a dramatic manner, before the open ark, with an Ashkenazic melody that dates back to the 16th century [109] Kol Nidre is recited in Aramaic, except in the Italian and Romaniote rites where it is recited in Hebrew.\n\n\nAvodah\nThe Avodah ('service') passage in the Musaf prayer recounts in detail the Yom Kippur Temple service which was once performed in the Temple in Jerusalem This passage traditionally features prominently in both the liturgy and the religious thought of the holiday [102] During its recitation, Jews \"imagine themselves in place of the priests when the Temple stood\" [112]\n\n\nConfession\nAs confession is a core aspect of repentance, [114] confession (or vidui) is a major part of the Yom Kippur prayer services A confession is recited ten times on Yom Kippur, twice in each of the five standard prayers In each prayer service, the confession is recited once by the individual in their silent prayer, and again communally during the cantor's repetition of the Amidah (The Maariv prayer has no repetition, so the second confession is instead recited in the communal Selichot recitation which follows the silent prayer.) Confession is recited an 11th time by individuals in the Mincha prayer of Yom Kippur eve, before the beginning of the holiday, and in some communities this is repeated by the Chazzan.\n\n\nIn Reform Judaism\nReform synagogues generally experience their largest attendance of the year on Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah for worship services The prayer philosophy of Reform, as described in the introduction of the movement's High Holy Day prayerbook, Mishkan HaNefesh, is to reflect \"varied theological approaches that enable a diverse congregation to share religious experience.. with a commitment to Reform tradition, as well as  [to] the larger Jewish tradition.\" A central feature of these Reform services is the rabbinic sermon \"For more than a century and a half in the Reform Movement,\" writes Rabbi Lance Sussman, \"High Holiday sermons were among the most anticipated events in synagogue life, especially on the eve of Rosh Hashanah and Kol Nidre night.\" [116]\n\n\nObservance\nAs one of the most culturally significant Jewish holidays, Yom Kippur is observed by many secular Jews who may not observe other holidays Many secular Jews attend synagogue on Yom Kippur – for many secular Jews the High Holy Days are the only times of the year during which they attend synagogue [117] – causing synagogue attendance to soar.\n\n\nObservance in Israel\nYom Kippur is a legal holiday in Israel There are no radio or television broadcasts, airports are shut down, there is no public transportation, and all shops and businesses are closed [118]\n\n\nObservance by athletes\nSince the early 20th century, numerous Jewish athletes have opted not to participate in their sport on Yom Kippur if a sporting event coincides with the High Holy Day Such incidents throw into sharp highlight the conflict many Jewish people face between social pressures and personal beliefs on a daily basis Athletes observing Yom Kippur are often lauded for their decision not to play, which is also seen as a source of pride by many in the Jewish community [123]\n\n\nRecognition by the United Nations\nSince 2016 the United Nations has officially recognized Yom Kippur, stating that from then on no official meetings would take place on the day [136] In addition, the United Nations stated that, beginning in 2016, they would have nine official holidays and seven floating holidays of which each employee would be able to choose one [136] It stated that the floating holidays will be Yom Kippur, Day of Vesak, Diwali, Gurpurab, Orthodox Christmas, Orthodox Good Friday, and Presidents' Day [136] This was the first time the United Nations officially recognized any Jewish holiday [136]\n\n\nDate of Yom Kippur\nYom Kippur falls each year on the tenth day of the Jewish month of Tishrei, which is nine days after the first day of Rosh Hashanah In terms of the Gregorian calendar, the earliest date on which Yom Kippur can fall is September 14, as happened most recently in 1899 and 2013 The latest Yom Kippur can occur relative to the Gregorian dates is on October 14, as happened in 1967 and will happen again in 2043 After 2089, the differences between the Hebrew calendar and the Gregorian calendar will result in Yom Kippur falling no earlier than September 15 [137] Gregorian calendar dates for recent and upcoming Yom Kippur holidays are:\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Yom Kippur**\n\nYom Kippur is one of the most significant holidays in the Jewish calendar, a day of atonement and forgiveness. The holiday has a rich history and is steeped in tradition, with a unique set of customs and practices that are observed by Jews around the world. In this article, we will explore the history, significance, and observance of Yom Kippur.\n\n**The Formal Hebrew Name**\n\nThe formal Hebrew name of the holiday is Yom HaKippurim, which means \"day of the atonements.\" This name is used in the Bible, Mishnah, and Shulchan Aruch, and is one of many Biblical Hebrew words that refers to a singular abstract concept using a grammatical plural form.\n\n**In the Torah**\n\nThe Torah calls the day Yom HaKippurim and decrees fasting and a strict prohibition of work on the tenth day of the seventh month, later known as Tishrei. The laws of Yom Kippur are commanded by God to Moses in three passages in the Torah. These passages emphasize the importance of fasting, prayer, and repentance on this day.\n\n**Temple Service**\n\nWhen the Temple in Jerusalem stood, Yom Kippur was the occasion of an elaborate sacrificial service, as commanded by Leviticus 16. The rabbis summarized the laws of this service in Mishnah tractate Yoma, and they appear in contemporary traditional Jewish prayer books for Yom Kippur, and are studied as part of a traditional Jewish Yom Kippur worship service. The Mussaf prayer on Yom Kippur includes a section known as the Avodah, where a poem is recited describing this Temple service.\n\n**Significance**\n\nYom Kippur is one of the two High Holy Days, or Days of Awe, alongside Rosh Hashanah. According to Jewish tradition, on Rosh Hashanah God inscribes each person's fate for the coming year into the Book of Life, and waits until Yom Kippur to \"seal\" the verdict. This process is described dramatically in the poem Unetanneh Tokef, which is recited on Rosh Hashanah in the Ashkenazic and Italian rites and on Yom Kippur in the Eastern Ashkenazic and Italian rites.\n\n**Repentance (Teshuva)**\n\nRepentance in Judaism traditionally consists of regretting having committed the sin, resolving not to commit that sin in the future, and confessing that sin before God. This process is a central theme of Yom Kippur, and is reflected in the various prayers and customs of the day.\n\n**Thirteen Attributes**\n\nAccording to the Bible, after the golden calf sin, Moses descended from Mount Sinai and broke the Tablets of Stone, which contained the Ten Commandments and symbolized the covenant with God. After God agreed to forgive the people's sin, Moses was told to return to Mount Sinai for a second 40-day period, in order to receive a second set of tablets. According to rabbinic tradition, the date Moses descended with the second set of tablets was Yom Kippur. On this day Moses announced to the people that they had been forgiven; as a result the Torah fixed this date as a permanent holiday of forgiveness.\n\n**Closeness to God**\n\nWhile many of the observances of Yom Kippur can be difficult, there is also a tradition in which they are interpreted positively, as indications of closeness to God. Various sources compare the observances of Yom Kippur – fasting, barefootness, standing in prayer, particular manners of prayer, even the peace that exists between Jews on this day – with the behavior of angels, suggesting that on Yom Kippur Jews become like angels in heaven, purified and close to God and not limited by physicality.\n\n**Purification**\n\nIn Leviticus 16:30, the Torah summarizes the purpose of Yom Kippur as follows: \"For on this day shall atone for you, to cleanse you from all your sins...\". This passage emphasizes the idea that Yom Kippur is a day of purification and atonement.\n\n**Jewish Unity**\n\nYom Kippur is considered a day of Jewish unity. Kol Nidre, in which vows are released, vows of excommunication against sinning Jews were similarly lifted, and these \"transgressors\" were allowed to pray alongside other Jews. According to the Talmud, \"Any fast in which Jewish sinners do not also participate is not a valid fast\".\n\n**Customs**\n\nOn the day preceding Yom Kippur, known as Erev Yom Kippur, a number of activities are customarily performed in preparation for Yom Kippur. These activities generally relate to the themes of the holiday, but are forbidden or impractical to do on Yom Kippur itself.\n\n**Fasting and Asceticism**\n\nThe Torah commands Jews to \"afflict themselves\" (ve'initem et nafshoteichem) on Yom Kippur. While these verses do not explicitly mention the form of affliction, the phrase \"afflicting oneself\" frequently appears elsewhere in connection with fasting or lack of food. According to the Jewish oral tradition, the Yom Kippur \"affliction\" consists of the following five prohibitions:\n\n* Eating and drinking\n* Washing and anointing the body\n* Wearing leather shoes\n* Marrying\n* Engaging in sexual relations\n\n**Symbolism**\n\nA number of different interpretations of these restrictions have been suggested. Some see them as a way of purifying the body and soul, while others view them as a way of demonstrating humility and detachment from worldly pleasures.\n\n**Prohibition on Work**\n\nThe Torah calls Yom Kippur a day of rest (shabbat shabbaton) on which work is prohibited. Thus, the activities forbidden on Shabbat are also forbidden on Yom Kippur: the 39 categories of work as well as the rabbinic Shabbat prohibitions.\n\n**Other Observances**\n\nWearing white clothing is traditional to symbolize one's purity on this day. Various reasons have been suggested for this custom, including the idea that white is a symbol of innocence and purity, and the idea that white clothing is a way of demonstrating one's commitment to spiritual growth and self-improvement.\n\n**Breaking of the Fast**\n\nFollowing the fast, Sephardic Jewish communities traditionally serve a drink made from melon seeds similar to the Turkish sübye. This is followed by coffee with milk and biscochos (savory ring-shaped cookies), pieces of bread dipped in olive oil and za'atar alongside tomato, and later, chicken cooked with dry quinces or plums.\n\n**Prayer Services**\n\nThe Yom Kippur prayer service includes several unique aspects. One is the number of prayer services, which is five, unlike a regular day which has three prayer services, or a Shabbat or Yom Tov which has four prayer services. The prayer services also include private and public confessions of sins (Vidui), and a unique prayer dedicated to the special Yom Kippur avodah (service) of the Kohen Gadol (high priest) in the Holy Temple in Jerusalem.\n\n**Kol Nidre**\n\nBefore sunset on Yom Kippur eve, worshipers gather in the synagogue.

Many secular Jews attend synagogue on Yom Kippur – for many secular Jews the High Holy Days are the only times of the year during which they attend synagogue – causing synagogue attendance to soar.\n\n**Observance in Israel**\n\nYom Kippur is a legal holiday in Israel. There are no radio or television broadcasts, airports are shut down, there is no public transportation, and all shops and businesses are closed.\n\n**Observance by Athletes**\n\nSince the early 20th century, numerous Jewish athletes have opted not to participate in their sport on Yom Kippur if a sporting event coincides with the High Holy Day. Such incidents throw into sharp highlight the conflict many Jewish people face between social pressures and personal beliefs on a daily basis.\n\n**Recognition by the United Nations**\n\nSince 2016 the United Nations has officially recognized Yom Kippur, stating that from then on no official meetings would take place on the day.

{"title": "Mandatory_Palestine", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe name given to the Mandate's territory was \"Palestine\", in accordance with local Palestinian Arab and Ottoman usage [9] [10] [11] [12] and with European tradition [b] The Mandate charter stipulated that Mandatory Palestine would have three official languages: English, Arabic and Hebrew.\n\n\nHistory\nFollowing the arrival of the British, Arab inhabitants established Muslim-Christian Associations in all of the major towns [18] In 1919 they joined to hold the first Palestine Arab Congress in Jerusalem [19] It was aimed primarily at representative government and opposition to the Balfour Declaration [20] Concurrently, the Zionist Commission formed in March 1918 and actively promoted Zionist objectives in Palestine On 19 April 1920, elections took place for the Assembly of Representatives of the Palestinian Jewish community [21]\n\n\n1920s\nFollowing the arrival of the British, Arab inhabitants established

the Assembly of Representatives of the Palestinian Jewish community [21]\n\n\n1930s: Arab armed insurgency\nIn 1930, Sheikh Izz ad-Din al-Qassam arrived in Palestine from Syria, then part of the French-ruled Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, and organised and established the Black Hand, an anti-Zionist and anti-British militant organisation He recruited and arranged military training for peasants, and by 1935 he had enlisted between 200 and 800 men They used bombs and firearms against Zionist settlers and vandalised settlers' orchards and British-built railway lines [35] In November 1935, two of his men engaged in a firefight with a Palestine Police patrol hunting fruit thieves and a policeman was killed Following the incident, British colonial police launched a search and surrounded al-Qassam in a cave near Ya'bad In the ensuing battle, al-Qassam was killed [35]\n\n\nThe Arab revolt\nThe death of al-Qassam on 20 November 1935 generated widespread outrage in the Arab community Huge crowds accompanied Qassam's body to his grave in Haifa A few months later, in April 1936, the Arab national general strike broke out The strike lasted until October 1936, instigated by the Arab Higher Committee, headed by Amin al-Husseini During the summer of that year, thousands of Jewish-farmed acres and orchards were destroyed Jewish civilians were attacked and killed, and some Jewish communities, such as those in Beisan (Beit She'an) and Acre, fled to safer areas [36] The violence abated for about a year while the British sent the Peel Commission to investigate [37]\n\n\nPartition proposals\nIn 1937, the Peel Commission proposed a partition between a small Jewish state, whose Arab population would have to be transferred, and an Arab state to be attached to the Emirate of Transjordan, this emirate also being part of the wider Mandate for Palestine The proposal was rejected outright by the Arabs The two main Jewish leaders, Chaim Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion, had convinced the Zionist Congress to equivocally approve the Peel recommendations as a basis for more negotiation [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] In a letter to his son in October 1937, Ben-Gurion explained that partition would be a first step to \"possession of the land as a whole\" [53] [54] [55] The same sentiment was recorded by Ben-Gurion on other occasions, such as at a meeting of the Jewish Agency executive in June 1938, [56] as well as by Chaim Weizmann [55] [57]\n\n\nSecond World War\nOn 10 June 1940, during the Second World War, the Kingdom of Italy declared war on the British Empire and sided with Nazi Germany Within a month, the Italians attacked Palestine from the air, bombing Tel Aviv and Haifa, [58] inflicting multiple casualties.\n\n\nAllied and Axis activity\nOn 10 June 1940, during the Second World War, the Kingdom of Italy declared war on the British Empire and sided with Nazi Germany Within a month, the Italians attacked Palestine from the air, bombing Tel Aviv and Haifa, [58] inflicting multiple casualties.\n\n\nMobilisation\nOn 3 July 1944, the British government consented to the establishment of a Jewish Brigade within the British Army, with hand-picked Jewish and also non-Jewish senior officers On 20 September 1944, an official communiqué by the War Office announced the formation of the Jewish Brigade Group of the British Army The Jewish Brigade then was stationed in Tarvisio, near the border triangle of Italy, Yugoslavia, and Austria, where it played a key role in the Berihah's efforts to help Jews escape Europe for Palestine, a role many of its members would continue after the brigade was disbanded Among its projects was the education and care of the Selvino children Later, veterans of the Jewish Brigade were to play a major role in the foundation of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).\n\n\nThe Holocaust and immigration quotas\nIn 1939, as a consequence of the White Paper of 1939, the British reduced the number of immigrants allowed into Palestine The Second World War and the Holocaust started shortly thereafter and once the 15,000 annual quota was exceeded, Jews fleeing Nazi persecution were interned in detention camps or deported to places such as Mauritius [66]\n\n\nBeginning of Zionist insurgency\nThe Jewish Lehi (Fighters for the Freedom of Israel) and Irgun (National Military Organisation) movements initiated violent uprisings against the British Mandate in the 1940s On 6 November 1944, Eliyahu Hakim and Eliyahu Bet Zuri (members of Lehi) assassinated Lord Moyne in Cairo Moyne was the British Minister of State for the Middle East and the assassination is said by some to have turned British Prime Minister Winston Churchill against the Zionist cause After the assassination of Lord Moyne, the Haganah kidnapped, interrogated, and turned over to the British many members of the Irgun (\"The Hunting Season\"), and the Jewish Agency Executive decided on a series of measures against \"terrorist organisations\" in Palestine Irgun ordered its members not to resist or retaliate with violence, so as to prevent a civil war.\n\n\nAfter the Second World War: Insurgency and the Partition Plan\nThe three main Jewish underground forces later united to form the Jewish Resistance Movement and carry out several attacks and bombings against the British administration In 1946, the Irgun blew up the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, the southern wing of which was the headquarters of the British administration, killing 92 people Following the bombing, the British Government began interning illegal Jewish immigrants in Cyprus In 1948, the Lehi assassinated Count Bernadotte, the UN mediator, in Jerusalem Yitzak Shamir, a future Prime Minister of Israel, was one of the conspirators.\n\n\nTermination of the mandate\nWhen the United Kingdom announced the independence of the Emirate of Transjordan as the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan in 1946, the final Assembly of the League of Nations and the General Assembly both adopted resolutions welcoming the news [84] The Jewish Agency objected, claiming that Transjordan was an integral part of Palestine, and that according to Article 80 of the UN Charter, the Jewish people had a secured interest in its territory [85]\n\n\nPolitics\nThe administration of the Mandate was officially under British Government Service however, the Peel Commission noted that it was unreliable, understaffed, and over-centralised and that racial antagonism between Jews and Arabs had begun affecting the whole Administration The Jewish Agency and the Arab Higher Committee representing the Jews and the Arabs respectively, had grown to be parallel governments themselves, a case of imperium in imperio [111]\n\n\nPalestinian Arab community\nThe resolution of the San Remo Conference contained a safeguarding clause for the existing rights of the non-Jewish communities The conference accepted the terms of the Mandate with reference to Palestine, on the understanding that there was inserted in the memorandum a legal undertaking by the Mandatory Power that it would not involve the surrender of the rights hitherto enjoyed by the non-Jewish communities in Palestine [112] The draft mandates for Mesopotamia and Palestine, and all of the post-war peace treaties, contained clauses for the protection of religious groups and minorities The mandates invoked the compulsory jurisdiction of the Permanent Court of International Justice in the event of any disputes [113]\n\n\nPalestinian Arab leadership and national aspirations\nUnder the British Mandate, the office of \"Mufti of Jerusalem\", traditionally limited in authority and geographical scope, was refashioned into that of \"Grand Mufti of Palestine\" Furthermore, a Supreme Muslim Council (SMC) was established and given various duties, such as the administration of religious endowments and the appointment of religious judges and local muftis In Ottoman times, these duties had been fulfilled by the Imperial bureaucracy in Constantinople (Istanbul) [124] In dealings with the Palestinian Arabs, the British negotiated with the elite rather than the middle or lower classes [125] They chose Hajj Amin al-Husseini to become Grand Mufti, although he was young and had received the fewest votes from Jerusalem's Islamic leaders [126] One of the mufti's rivals, Raghib Bey al-Nashashibi, had already been appointed Mayor of Jerusalem in 1920, replacing Musa Kazim, whom the British removed after the Nabi Musa riots of 1920, [127] during which he exhorted the crowd to give their blood for Palestine [128] During the entire Mandate period, but especially during the latter half, the rivalry between the mufti and al-Nashashibi dominated Palestinian politics Khalidi ascribes the failure of the Palestinian leaders to enroll mass support to the fact that they had been part of the ruling elite and accustomed to their commands being obeyed; thus, the idea of mobilising the masses was unknown to them [129]\n\n\nPalestinian Arab journalism\nAfter the Palestinian Arab press during the Ottoman period had been suppressed due to the outbreak of World War I in 1914, only two of the three leading newspapers of the Ottoman era were reopened during the mandate period, Al-Karmil and Falastin During this period, the press became more diverse, and increasingly reflected different political factions and national consciousness According to one survey in the mid 1930s, over 250 Arabic newspapers and 65 in other languages were circulating in Mandatory Palestine [133] Twenty newspapers were established in Jerusalem, six in Jaffa, twelve in Haifa, and others in Bethlehem, Gaza and Tulkarem [133]\n\n\nJewish community\nThe conquest of Ottoman Syria by British forces in 1917 found a mixed community in the region, with Palestine, the southern part of Ottoman Syria, containing a mixed population of Muslims, Christians, Jews and Druze In this period, the Jewish community (Yishuv) in Palestine was composed of traditional Jewish communities in cities (the Old Yishuv), which had existed for centuries, [137] and the newly established agricultural Zionist communities (the New Yishuv), established since the 1870s With the establishment of the Mandate, the Jewish community in Palestine formed the Zionist Commission to represent its interests.\n\n\nJewish immigration\nDuring the Mandate, the Yishuv grew from one-sixth to almost one-third of the population According to official records, 367,845 Jews and 33,304 non-Jews immigrated legally between 1920 and 1945 [140] It was estimated that another 50–60,000 Jews and a marginal number of Arabs, the latter mostly on a seasonal basis, immigrated illegally during this period [141] Immigration accounted for most of the increase of Jewish population, while the non-Jewish population increase was largely natural [142] Of the Jewish immigrants, in 1939 most had come from Germany and Czechoslovakia, but in 1940–1944 most came from Romania and Poland, with an additional 3,530 immigrants arriving from Yemen during the same period [143]\n\n\nJewish national home\nIn 1919, the general secretary (and future President) of the Zionist Organisation, Nahum Sokolow, published History of Zionism (1600–1918) He also represented the Zionist Organisation at the Paris Peace Conference.\n\n\nLand ownership\nAfter transition to the British rule, much of the agricultural land in Palestine (about one third of the whole territory) was still owned by the same landowners as under Ottoman rule, mostly powerful Arab clans and local Muslim sheikhs Other lands had been held by foreign Christian organisations (most notably the Greek Orthodox Church), as well as Jewish private and Zionist organisations, and to lesser degree by small minorities of Baháʼís, Samaritans and Circassians.\n\n\nLand ownership by district\nThe following table shows the 1945 land ownership of mandatory Palestine by district:\n\n\nLand ownership by corporation\nThe table below shows the land ownership of Palestine by large Jewish Corporations (in square kilometres) on 31 December 1945.\n\n\nLand ownership by type\nThe land owned privately and collectively by Jews, Arabs and other non-Jews can be classified as urban, rural built-on, cultivable (farmed), and uncultivable The following chart shows the ownership by Jews, Arabs and other non-Jews in each of the categories.\n\n\nList of Mandatory land laws\nIn February 1940, the British Government of Palestine promulgated the Land Transfer Regulations which divided Palestine into three regions with different restrictions on land sales applying to each In Zone \"A\", which included the hill-country of Judea as a whole, certain areas in the Jaffa sub-District, and in the Gaza District, and the northern part of the Beersheba sub-District, new agreements for sale of land other than to a Palestinian Arab were forbidden without the High Commissioner's permission In Zone \"B\", which included the Jezreel Valley, eastern Galilee, a parcel of coastal plain south of Haifa, a region northeast of the Gaza District, and the southern part of the Beersheba sub-District, sale of land by a Palestinian Arab was forbidden except to a Palestinian Arab with similar exceptions In the \"free zone\", which consisted of Haifa Bay, the coastal plain from Zikhron Ya'akov to Yibna, and the neighborhood of Jerusalem, there were no restrictions The reason given for the regulations was that the Mandatory was required to \"ensur [e] that the rights and positions of other sections of the population are not prejudiced\", and an assertion that \"such transfers of land must be restricted if Arab cultivators are to maintain their existing standard of life and a considerable landless Arab population is not soon to be created\" [171]\n\n\nDemographics\nIn 1920, the majority of the approximately 750,000 people in this multi-ethnic region were Arabic-speaking Muslims, including a Bedouin population (estimated at 103,331 at the time of the 1922 census [172] and concentrated in the Beersheba area and the region south and east of it), as well as Jews (who accounted for some 11% of the total) and smaller groups of Druze, Syrians, Sudanese, Somalis, Circassians, Egyptians, Copts, Greeks, and Hejazi Arabs:\n\n\nBritish censuses and estimations\nIn 1920, the majority of the approximately 750,000 people in this multi-ethnic region were Arabic-speaking Muslims, including a Bedouin population

were administered by the office of the British High Commissioner for Palestine [177]\n\n\nEconomy\nBetween 1922 and 1947, the annual growth rate of the Jewish sector of the economy was 13.2%, mainly due to immigration and foreign capital, while that of the Arab was 6.5% Per capita, these figures were 4.8% and 3.6% respectively By 1936, Jews earned 2.6 times as much as Arabs [182] Compared to Arabs in other countries, Palestinian Arabs earned slightly more [183]\n\n\nEducation\nUnder the British Mandate, the country developed economically and culturally In 1919, the Jewish community founded a centralised Hebrew school system, and the following year established the Assembly of Representatives, the Jewish National Council and the Histadrut labour federation The Technion university was founded in 1924, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1925.\n\n\nGallery\nThe National Socialist movement of Greater Germany has, since its inception, inscribed upon its flag the fight

territory under British administration from 1920 to 1948, established after the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I. The territory was located in the Middle East, corresponding to the modern-day state of Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. During the Mandatory period, the territory was home to a diverse population of Jews, Arabs, and other minority groups.\n\nEtymology\nThe name given to the Mandate's territory was \"Palestine\", in accordance with local Palestinian Arab and Ottoman usage, and with European tradition. The Mandate charter stipulated that Mandatory Palestine would have three official languages: English, Arabic, and Hebrew.\n\nHistory\nFollowing the arrival of the British, Arab inhabitants established Muslim-Christian Associations in all of the major towns. In 1919, they joined to hold the first Palestine Arab Congress in Jerusalem, which was aimed primarily at representative government and opposition to the Balfour Declaration. Concurrently, the Zionist Commission formed in March 1918 and actively promoted Zionist objectives in Palestine. On 19 April 1920, elections took place for the Assembly of Representatives of the Palestinian Jewish community.\n\n1920s\nDuring the 1920s, the British government struggled to maintain order in the territory, which was characterized by a growing Arab nationalist movement and a significant influx of Jewish immigrants. The Arab Higher Committee, formed in 1920, played a key role in organizing protests and strikes against the British administration. In 1921, the British government introduced the Palestine Order in Council, which established a system of government and administration for the territory. The order also created a legislative council, which was composed of Arab and Jewish members, but excluded the British government from its deliberations.\n\n1930s: Arab armed insurgency\nIn the early 1930s, the Arab nationalist movement in Palestine became increasingly militant, with the formation of groups such as the Black Hand and the Arab Higher Committee. In 1930, Sheikh Izz ad-Din al-Qassam arrived in Palestine from Syria and established the Black Hand, an anti-Zionist and anti-British militant organization. Al-Qassam recruited and trained peasants to use bombs and firearms against Zionist settlers and vandalized settlers' orchards and British-built railway lines. In November 1935, two of his men engaged in a firefight with a Palestine Police patrol, resulting in the death of a policeman. Following the incident, British colonial police launched a search and surrounded al-Qassam in a cave near Ya'bad, where he was killed in a battle.\n\nThe Arab revolt\nThe death of al-Qassam on 20 November 1935 generated widespread outrage in the Arab community, with huge crowds accompanying his body to its grave in Haifa.

proposals\nIn 1937, the Peel Commission proposed a partition between a small Jewish state, whose Arab population would have to be transferred, and an Arab state to be attached to the Emirate of Transjordan, this emirate also being part of the wider Mandate for Palestine The proposal was rejected outright by the Arabs The two main Jewish leaders, Chaim Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion, had convinced the Zionist Congress to equivocally approve the Peel recommendations as a basis for more negotiation [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] In a letter to his son in October 1937, Ben-Gurion explained that partition would be a first step to \"possession of the land as a whole\" [53] [54] [55] The same sentiment was recorded by Ben-Gurion on other occasions, such as at a meeting of the Jewish Agency executive in June 1938, [56] as well as by Chaim Weizmann [55] [57]\n\n\nSecond World War\nOn 10 June 1940, during the Second World War, the Kingdom of Italy declared war on the British Empire and sided with Nazi Germany Within a month, the Italians attacked Palestine from the air, bombing Tel Aviv and Haifa, [58] inflicting multiple casualties.\n\n\nAllied and Axis activity\nOn 10 June 1940, during the Second World War, the Kingdom of Italy declared war on the British Empire and sided with Nazi Germany Within a month, the Italians attacked Palestine from the air, bombing Tel Aviv and Haifa, [58] inflicting multiple casualties.\n\n\nMobilisation\nOn 3 July 1944, the British government consented to the establishment of a Jewish Brigade within the British Army, with hand-picked Jewish and also non-Jewish senior officers On 20 September 1944, an official communiqué by the War Office announced the formation of the Jewish Brigade Group of the British Army The Jewish Brigade then was stationed in Tarvisio, near the border triangle of Italy, Yugoslavia, and Austria, where it played a key role in the Berihah's efforts to help Jews escape Europe for Palestine, a role many of its members would continue after the brigade was disbanded Among its projects was the education and care of the Selvino children Later, veterans of the Jewish Brigade were to play a major role in the foundation of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).\n\n\nThe Holocaust and immigration quotas\nIn 1939, as a consequence of the White Paper of 1939, the British reduced the number of immigrants allowed into Palestine The Second World War and the Holocaust started shortly thereafter and once the 15,000 annual quota was exceeded, Jews fleeing Nazi persecution were interned in detention camps or deported to places such as Mauritius [66]\n\n\nBeginning of Zionist insurgency\nThe Jewish Lehi (Fighters for the Freedom of Israel) and Irgun (National Military Organisation) movements initiated violent uprisings against the British Mandate in the 1940s On 6 November 1944, Eliyahu Hakim and Eliyahu Bet Zuri (members of Lehi) assassinated Lord Moyne in Cairo Moyne was the British Minister of State for the Middle East and the assassination is said by some to have turned British Prime Minister Winston Churchill against the Zionist cause After the assassination of Lord Moyne, the Haganah kidnapped, interrogated, and turned over to the British many members of the Irgun (\"The Hunting Season\"), and the Jewish Agency Executive decided on a series of measures against \"terrorist organisations\" in Palestine Irgun ordered its members not to resist or retaliate with violence, so as to prevent a civil war.\n\n\nAfter the Second World War: Insurgency and the Partition Plan\nThe three main Jewish underground forces later united to form the Jewish Resistance Movement and carry out several attacks and bombings against the British administration In 1946, the Irgun blew up the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, the southern wing of which was the headquarters of the British administration, killing 92 people Following the bombing, the British Government began interning illegal Jewish immigrants in Cyprus In 1948, the Lehi assassinated Count Bernadotte, the UN mediator, in Jerusalem Yitzak Shamir, a future Prime Minister of Israel, was one of the conspirators.\n\n\nTermination of the mandate\nWhen the United Kingdom announced the independence of the Emirate of Transjordan as the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan in 1946, the final Assembly of the League of Nations and the General Assembly both adopted resolutions welcoming the news [84] The Jewish Agency objected, claiming that Transjordan was an integral part of Palestine, and that according to Article 80 of the UN Charter, the Jewish people had a secured interest in its territory [85]\n\n\nPolitics\nThe administration of the Mandate was officially under British Government Service however, the Peel Commission noted that it was unreliable, understaffed, and over-centralised and that racial antagonism between Jews and Arabs had begun affecting the whole Administration The Jewish Agency and the Arab Higher Committee representing the Jews and the Arabs respectively, had grown to be parallel governments themselves, a case of imperium in imperio [111]\n\n\nPalestinian Arab community\nThe resolution of the San Remo Conference contained a safeguarding clause for the existing rights of the non-Jewish communities The conference accepted the terms of the Mandate with reference to Palestine, on the understanding that there was inserted in the memorandum a legal undertaking by the Mandatory Power that it would not involve the surrender of the rights hitherto enjoyed by the non-Jewish communities in Palestine [112] The draft mandates for Mesopotamia and Palestine, and all of the post-war peace treaties, contained clauses for the protection of religious groups and minorities The mandates invoked the compulsory jurisdiction of the Permanent Court of International Justice in the event of any disputes [113]\n\n\nPalestinian Arab leadership and national aspirations\nUnder the British Mandate, the office of \"Mufti of Jerusalem\", traditionally limited in authority and geographical scope, was refashioned into that of \"Grand Mufti of Palestine\" Furthermore, a Supreme Muslim Council (SMC) was established and given various duties, such as the administration of religious endowments and the appointment of religious judges and local muftis In Ottoman times, these duties had been fulfilled by the Imperial bureaucracy in Constantinople (Istanbul) [124] In dealings with the Palestinian Arabs, the British negotiated with the elite rather than the middle or lower classes [125] They chose Hajj Amin al-Husseini to become Grand Mufti, although he was young and had received the fewest votes from Jerusalem's Islamic leaders [126] One of the mufti's rivals, Raghib Bey al-Nashashibi, had already been appointed Mayor of Jerusalem in 1920, replacing Musa Kazim, whom the British removed after the Nabi Musa riots of 1920, [127] during which he exhorted the crowd to give their blood for Palestine [128] During the entire Mandate period, but especially during the latter half, the rivalry between the mufti and al-Nashashibi dominated Palestinian politics Khalidi ascribes the failure of the Palestinian leaders to enroll mass support to the fact that they had been part of the ruling elite and accustomed to their commands being obeyed; thus, the idea of mobilising the masses was unknown to them [129]\n\n\nPalestinian Arab journalism\nAfter the Palestinian Arab press during the Ottoman period had been suppressed due to the outbreak of World War I in 1914, only two of the three leading newspapers of the Ottoman era were reopened during the mandate period, Al-Karmil and Falastin During this period, the press became more diverse, and increasingly reflected different political factions and national consciousness According to one survey in the mid 1930s, over 250 Arabic newspapers and 65 in other languages were circulating in Mandatory Palestine [133] Twenty newspapers were established in Jerusalem, six in Jaffa, twelve in Haifa, and others in Bethlehem, Gaza and Tulkarem [133]\n\n\nJewish community\nThe conquest of Ottoman Syria by British forces in 1917 found a mixed community in the region, with Palestine, the southern part of Ottoman Syria, containing a mixed population of Muslims, Christians, Jews and Druze In this period, the Jewish community (Yishuv) in Palestine was composed of traditional Jewish communities in cities (the Old Yishuv), which had existed for centuries, [137] and the newly established agricultural Zionist communities (the New Yishuv), established since the 1870s With the establishment of the Mandate, the Jewish community in Palestine formed the Zionist Commission to represent its interests.\n\n\nJewish immigration\nDuring the Mandate, the Yishuv grew from one-sixth to almost one-third of the population According to official records, 367,845 Jews and 33,304 non-Jews immigrated legally between 1920 and 1945 [140] It was estimated that another 50–60,000 Jews and a marginal number of Arabs, the latter mostly on a seasonal basis, immigrated illegally during this period [141] Immigration accounted for most of the increase of Jewish population, while the non-Jewish population increase was largely natural [142] Of the Jewish immigrants, in 1939 most had come from Germany and Czechoslovakia, but in 1940–1944 most came from Romania and Poland, with an additional 3,530 immigrants arriving from Yemen during the same period [143]\n\n\nJewish national home\nIn 1919, the general secretary (and future President) of the Zionist Organisation, Nahum Sokolow, published History of Zionism (1600–1918) He also represented the Zionist Organisation at the Paris Peace Conference.\n\n\nLand ownership\nAfter transition to the British rule, much of the agricultural land in Palestine (about one third of the whole territory) was still owned by the same landowners as under Ottoman rule, mostly powerful Arab clans and local Muslim sheikhs Other lands had been held by foreign Christian organisations (most notably the Greek Orthodox Church), as well as Jewish private and Zionist organisations, and to lesser degree by small minorities of Baháʼís, Samaritans and Circassians.\n\n\nLand ownership by district\nThe following table shows the 1945 land ownership of mandatory Palestine by district:\n\n\nLand ownership by corporation\nThe table below shows the land ownership of Palestine by large Jewish Corporations (in square kilometres) on 31 December 1945.\n\n\nLand ownership by type\nThe land owned privately and collectively by Jews, Arabs and other non-Jews can be classified as urban, rural built-on, cultivable (farmed), and uncultivable The following chart shows the ownership by Jews, Arabs and other non-Jews in each of the categories.\n\n\nList of Mandatory land laws\nIn February 1940, the British Government of Palestine promulgated the Land Transfer Regulations which divided Palestine into three regions with different restrictions on land sales applying to each In Zone \"A\", which included the hill-country of Judea as a whole, certain areas in the Jaffa sub-District, and in the Gaza District, and the northern part of the Beersheba sub-District, new agreements for sale of land other than to a Palestinian Arab were forbidden without the High Commissioner's permission In Zone \"B\", which included the Jezreel Valley, eastern Galilee, a parcel of coastal plain south of Haifa, a region northeast of the Gaza District, and the southern part of the Beersheba sub-District, sale of land by a Palestinian Arab was forbidden except to a Palestinian Arab with similar exceptions In the \"free zone\", which consisted of Haifa Bay, the coastal plain from Zikhron Ya'akov to Yibna, and the neighborhood of Jerusalem, there were no restrictions The reason given for the regulations was that the Mandatory was required to \"ensur [e] that the rights and positions of other sections of the population are not prejudiced\", and an assertion that \"such transfers of land must be restricted if Arab cultivators are to maintain their existing standard of life and a considerable landless Arab population is not soon to be created\" [171]\n\n\nDemographics\nIn 1920, the majority of the approximately 750,000 people in this multi-ethnic region were Arabic-speaking Muslims, including a Bedouin population (estimated at 103,331 at the time of the 1922 census [172] and concentrated in the Beersheba area and the region south and east of it), as well as Jews (who accounted for some 11% of the total) and smaller groups of Druze, Syrians, Sudanese, Somalis, Circassians, Egyptians, Copts, Greeks, and Hejazi Arabs:\n\n\nBritish censuses and estimations\nIn 1920, the majority of the approximately 750,000 people in this multi-ethnic region were Arabic-speaking Muslims, including a Bedouin population (estimated at 103,331 at the time of the 1922 census [172] and concentrated in the Beersheba area and the region south and east of it), as well as Jews (who accounted for some 11% of the total) and smaller groups of Druze, Syrians, Sudanese, Somalis, Circassians, Egyptians, Copts, Greeks, and Hejazi Arabs:\n\n\nBy district\nThe following table gives the religious demography of each of the 16 districts of the Mandate in 1945.\n\n\nUrban areas\nThe table below shows the population of the municipal areas of Palestine in 1922, at the start of the mandate period, per the 1922 census of Palestine [176]\n\n\nGovernment and institutions\nUnder the terms of the August 1922 Palestine Order in Council, the Mandate territory was divided into administrative regions known as districts and were administered by the office of the British High Commissioner for Palestine [177]\n\n\nEconomy\nBetween 1922 and 1947, the annual growth rate of the Jewish sector of the economy was 13.2%, mainly due to immigration and foreign capital, while that of the Arab was 6.5% Per capita, these figures were 4.8% and 3.6% respectively By 1936, Jews earned 2.6 times as much as Arabs [182] Compared to Arabs in other countries, Palestinian Arabs earned slightly more [183]\n\n\nEducation\nUnder the British Mandate, the country developed economically and culturally In 1919, the Jewish community founded a centralised Hebrew school system, and the following year established the Assembly of Representatives, the Jewish National Council and the Histadrut labour federation The Technion university was founded in 1924, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1925.\n\n\nGallery\nThe National Socialist movement of Greater Germany has, since its inception, inscribed upon its flag the fight

Oxford; Anthony à Wood in Athenae Oxonienses (1691) states that he \"was more prone to easier and smoother studies, than in pecking and hewing at logic\" [4]\n\n\n1585–1591: First published work and patronage of Sir Edward Dymoke\nDaniel's first published work was The Worthy Tract of Paulus Jovius, a translation of an Italian treatise on impresa or emblems by historian Paolo Giovio [9] [10] This emblem book was published in 1585 by Simon Waterson, who would remain Daniel's friend and principal publisher for the rest of his life The Worthy Tract of Paulus Jovius was dedicated to Sir Edward Dymoke, the Queen's Champion Daniel's association with Dymoke was the first of a series of close relationships with noble patrons that came to characterise the author's literary career \n\n\n1591–1593: Patronage of Mary Sidney, Delia, Rosamond, and Cleopatra\nDaniel's literary career was effectively launched in late 1591 with the unauthorized inclusion of some of his Delia sonnets in the posthumous first edition of Sir Philip Sidney's Astrophel and Stella [15] Sidney's sister, Mary Sidney, the Countess of Pembroke, objected to the surreptitious publication of her brother's work, and the edition was recalled by the Stationers Company [16] In 1592, Daniel published the first authorized edition of his own poetic works, the sonnet cycle Delia, and the historical poem The Complaint of Rosamond Daniel dedicated Delia to Mary Sidney and begged her forgiveness for the inclusion of his poems in the unauthorized edition of her brother's work, claiming that he had been \"betrayed by the indiscretions of a greedy printer.\" [17] Soon after the publication of Delia and Rosamond, Daniel was invited to join the Pembroke household, serving the family in some capacity, perhaps as tutor to the twelve-year-old William Herbert [18] [19] He also joined a group of writers encouraged by Mary Sidney that has come to be referred to as the Wilton Circle, a group that included Edmund Spenser, Michael Drayton, Sir John Davies, and Abraham Fraunce [20]\n\n\n1594–1601: Mountjoy, Civil Wars, Poetical Essays, and Works\nAfter the publication of Cleopatra, Daniel parted ways with Mary Sidney and experienced financial difficulties He was taken in by Charles Blount, Baron Mountjoy, as described in the first edition of Daniel's epic poem about the Wars of the Roses, The First Four Books of the Civil Wars Between the Two Houses of Lancaster and York, published in 1595 [28] The poem included complimentary references to Mountjoy and a section praising him and his close friend Robert Devereux, the Earl of Essex Daniel had worked at Essex's estate, Wanstead, as he wrote the initial version of his poem [29]\n\n\n1603–1607: Royal patronage, Philotas, and the death of Mountjoy\nAfter Queen Elizabeth's death and King James's accession in 1603, Daniel quickly became associated with the new court Through the support of Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford, he presented his Panegyrick Congratulatory to the King's Most Excellent Majesty to the new king in April of that year [34] A revised version of the poem was published later in 1603, along with Daniel's Epistles addressed to various members of the nobility and his essay A Defence of Rhyme \n\n\n1609–1619: Final version of Civil Wars, country life, prose History, and death\nIn 1609, Daniel published his final version of The Civil Wars, a work that now extended to eight books Daniel dedicated the work to Mary Sidney, the patron who had helped first bring him to prominence In the dedication to the epic poem, he stated that he had intended to continue the work \"unto the glorious union of Henry VII\", meaning the marriage of Henry Tudor (Queen Elizabeth's grandfather) to Elizabeth of York in 1486 [43] The final version of the poem, however, only extended through Edward IV's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville in 1464 In the dedication, Daniel also stated that he intended to write a prose \"History of England, from the Conquest\", introducing the principal project that was to occupy the rest of his literary career and life [44]\n\n\nWorks\nMany of Samuel Daniel's poems and plays were reprinted multiple times in collections of his writings during his lifetime, often in substantially revised editions that represented distinct versions of the works [55] The following list of Daniel's major works demonstrates the breadth of his writing, both in terms of subject and genre Included in the list is a brief description of the work, the volume and year in which it originally appeared, and the years of significant revisions: [56]\n\n\nDaniel and Shakespeare\nSamuel Daniel was born a year or two before William Shakespeare and died three years after him The literary careers of both started in the 1590s and ended in the 1610s Both writers enjoyed success and came to be regarded as leading authors of the period, though Shakespeare was more associated with the popular stage and Daniel with courtly poetry and noble patrons Literary scholars generally accept that many of Shakespeare's plays and poems were influenced by Samuel Daniel's works, while the possible influence of Shakespeare's plays on Daniel's works has been more subject to debate [62] [63]\n\n\nDaniel's influence on Shakespeare\nEvidence of the influence of Daniel's works on Shakespeare includes the following:\n\n\nShakespeare's influence on Daniel\nEvidence of Shakespeare's possible influence on Daniel's works includes the following:\n\n\nPersonal relationship\nAn essay by Albert Harthshorne in 1899 in The Archaeological Journal reported that during his retirement, Daniel \"received his friends, among them Shakespeare, Chapman, Marlowe of the 'mighty line', Drayton, and Jonson\" [95] The facts that Christopher Marlowe had died in 1593, many years before Daniel's retirement, and that Daniel had an acrimonious relationship with Jonson, [96] casts doubt on the comment as a whole There is no direct evidence that Daniel was friendly with Shakespeare or knew him personally, although they likely shared many common acquaintances, including John Florio, Henry Wriothesley, William Herbert, and Ben Jonson [97]\n\n\nLiterary reputation and style\nDuring his lifetime, Daniel was regarded as one of the most important English authors of the period [98] His writings contributed innovations to a wide range of literary genres, including the sonnet cycle (Delia), the complaint (Complaint of Rosamond), neo-classical drama (Tragedy of Cleopatra), the epic (The Civil Wars), the verse colloquy (Musophilus), the literary essay (\"Defence of Rhyme\"), and epistolary verse (Certain Epistles) [99] [100] He continued to have admirers for centuries after his death and his works had a significant influence on many other authors John Milton adapted elements of his works in Paradise Lost [101] Alexander Pope parodied the opening of The Civil Wars in The Rape of the Lock [102] Samuel Taylor Coleridge was a particular admirer of Daniel's work, referring to him as \"one of the golden writers of our golden Elizabethan age .. whose diction bears no mark of time\" [103] Coleridge's friend and collaborator William Wordsworth reflected Daniel's influence in many of his works and included an extended quotation from Daniel's Epistle to the Countess of Cumberland in his poem The Excursion [104] Henry David Thoreau referred to Daniel to elucidate his own thoughts in A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers [105]\n\n\nModern editions and recent references to Daniel\nThe last time a thorough edition of the works of Daniel appeared in print was in the late nineteenth century, in the five-volume Complete Works in Verse and Prose (1885–1896), edited by Alexander Balloch Grosart Two collections of selected works were published during the twentieth century: Poems and a Defence of Ryme (1930), an edition that preserves the original early modern spelling and punctuation, edited by Arthur Colby Sprague, and Selected Poetry and a Defense of Rhyme (1998), a modernized edition, edited by Geoffrey G Hiller and Peter L Groves John Pitcher is currently working on a multi-volume critical edition of Daniel's complete works to be published by Oxford University Press [118] [119]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Samuel Daniel**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSamuel Daniel (1562/63 – 1619) was an English poet, playwright, and historian who played a significant role in the literary and cultural landscape of Elizabethan and Jacobean England. He was a prominent figure in the Wilton Circle, a group of writers associated with Mary Sidney, Countess of Pembroke, and was known for his innovations in various literary genres, including the sonnet cycle, the complaint, neo-classical drama, the epic, and the literary essay. This article provides an overview of Daniel's life, literary career, and works, as well as his relationships with other notable authors, including William Shakespeare.\n\n**Life and Literary Career**\n\nLittle is known about Samuel Daniel's early life, but it is believed that he was born not far from Taunton in Somerset. The earliest evidence of his life is an entry in the signature book of Oxford University, which documents his matriculation at Magdalen Hall (now Hertford College) on 17 November 1581, aged 19.

Through the support of Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford, he presented his \"Panegyrick Congratulatory to the King's Most Excellent Majesty\" to the new king in April of that year. A revised version of the poem was published later in 1603, along with Daniel's \"Epistles\" addressed to various members of the nobility and his essay \"A Defence of Rhyme.\"\n\n**1609–1619: Final Version of Civil Wars, Country Life, Prose History, and Death**\n\nIn 1609, Daniel published his final version of \"The Civil Wars,\" a work that now extended to eight books. Daniel dedicated the work to Mary Sidney, the patron who had helped first bring him to prominence. The final version of the poem, however, only extended through Edward IV's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville in 1464. In the dedication, Daniel stated that he intended to write a prose \"History of England, from the Conquest,\" introducing the principal project that was to occupy the rest of his literary career and life.\n\n**Works**\n\nMany of Samuel Daniel's poems and plays were reprinted multiple times in collections of his writings during his lifetime, often in substantially revised editions that represented distinct versions of the works. The following list of Daniel's major works demonstrates the breadth of his writing, both in terms of subject and genre:\n\n* \"The Worthy Tract of Paulus Jovius\" (1585)\n* \"Delia\" (1592)\n* \"The Complaint of Rosamond\" (1592)\n* \"The First Four Books of the Civil Wars Between the Two Houses of Lancaster and York\" (1595)\n* \"Philotas\" (1599)\n* \"A Panegyrick Congratulatory to the King's Most Excellent Majesty\" (1603)\n* \"Epistles\" (1603)\n* \"A Defence of Rhyme\" (1603)\n* \"The Civil Wars\" (1609)\n* \"Musophilus\" (1599)\n* \"Certain Epistles\" (1592)\n\n**Daniel and Shakespeare**\n\nSamuel Daniel was born a year or two before William Shakespeare and died three years after him. Both writers enjoyed success and came to be regarded as leading authors of the period, though Shakespeare was more associated with the popular stage and Daniel with courtly poetry and noble patrons. Literary scholars generally accept that many of Shakespeare's plays and poems were influenced by Samuel Daniel's works, while the possible influence of Shakespeare's plays on Daniel's works has been more subject to debate.\n\n**Daniel's Influence on Shakespeare**\n\nEvidence of the influence of Daniel's works on Shakespeare includes:\n\n* Shakespeare's use of Daniel's themes and motifs in his plays, such as the use of the \"war between the two houses\" theme in \"Richard III\" and \"Henry IV, Part 2.\"\n* Shakespeare's use of Daniel's poetic style and imagery in his sonnets, such as the use of the \"complaint\" form in Sonnet 138.\n\n**Shakespeare's Influence on Daniel**\n\nEvidence of Shakespeare's possible influence on Daniel's works includes:\n\n* Daniel's use of Shakespeare's plays as a source of inspiration for his own works, such as the use of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" as a source for \"Philotas.\"\n* Daniel's use of Shakespeare's poetic style and imagery in his own poems, such as the use of the \"complaint\" form in \"The Complaint of Rosamond.\"\n\n**Personal Relationship**\n\nAn essay by Albert Harthshorne in 1899 in The Archaeological Journal reported that during his retirement, Daniel \"received his friends, among them Shakespeare, Chapman, Marlowe of the 'mighty line', Drayton, and Jonson.\" However, the facts that Christopher Marlowe had died in 1593, many years before Daniel's retirement, and that Daniel had an acrimonious relationship with Jonson, cast doubt on the comment as a whole. There is no direct evidence that Daniel was friendly with Shakespeare or knew him personally, although they likely shared many common acquaintances, including John Florio, Henry Wriothesley, William Herbert, and Ben Jonson.\n\n**Literary Reputation and Style**\n\nDuring his lifetime, Daniel was regarded as one of the most important English authors of the period. His writings contributed innovations to a wide range of literary genres, including the sonnet cycle (Delia), the complaint (Complaint of Rosamond), neo-classical drama (Tragedy of Cleopatra), the epic (The Civil Wars), the verse colloquy (Musophilus), the literary essay (\"Defence of Rhyme\"), and epistolary verse (Certain Epistles). He continued to have admirers for centuries after his death and his works had a significant influence on many other authors, including John Milton, Alexander Pope, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth, and Henry David Thoreau.\n\n**Modern Editions and Recent References to Daniel**\n\nThe last time a thorough edition of the works of Daniel appeared in print was in the late nineteenth century, in the five-volume Complete Works in Verse and Prose (1885–1896), edited by Alexander Balloch Grosart. Two collections of selected works were published during the twentieth century: Poems and a Defence of Ryme (1930), an edition that preserves the original early modern spelling and punctuation, edited by Arthur Colby Sprague, and Selected Poetry and a Defense of Rhyme (1998), a modernized edition, edited by Geoffrey G Hiller and Peter L Groves.

dedicated to Sir Edward Dymoke, the Queen's Champion Daniel's association with Dymoke was the first of a series of close relationships with noble patrons that came to characterise the author's literary career \n\n\n1591–1593: Patronage of Mary Sidney, Delia, Rosamond, and Cleopatra\nDaniel's literary career was effectively launched in late 1591 with the unauthorized inclusion of some of his Delia sonnets in the posthumous first edition of Sir Philip Sidney's Astrophel and Stella [15] Sidney's sister, Mary Sidney, the Countess of Pembroke, objected to the surreptitious publication of her brother's work, and the edition was recalled by the Stationers Company [16] In 1592, Daniel published the first authorized edition of his own poetic works, the sonnet cycle Delia, and the historical poem The Complaint of Rosamond Daniel dedicated Delia to Mary Sidney and begged her forgiveness for the inclusion of his poems in the unauthorized edition of her brother's work, claiming that he had been \"betrayed by the indiscretions of a greedy printer.\" [17] Soon after the publication of Delia and Rosamond, Daniel was invited to join the Pembroke household, serving the family in some capacity, perhaps as tutor to the twelve-year-old William Herbert [18] [19] He also joined a group of writers encouraged by Mary Sidney that has come to be referred to as the Wilton Circle, a group

1486 [43] The final version of the poem, however, only extended through Edward IV's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville in 1464 In the dedication, Daniel also stated that he intended to write a prose

Born in Modena, Italy on May 1, 1925, Amorth spent his life dedicated to serving the Lord and helping others overcome the forces of evil.\n\n**Life and Work**\n\nAmorth was born into a family deeply attached to Catholicism and Catholic Action. His parents were devout Catholics, and their faith had a profound impact on his early life. Amorth was ordained a Roman Catholic priest in 1954 and began his ministry in the Diocese of Rome. In 1986, he was appointed an exorcist of the Diocese of Rome under the tutelage of Candido Amantini, a renowned exorcist and spiritual director.\n\nIn 1990, Amorth founded the International Association of Exorcists, an organization dedicated to promoting the Catholic Church's teachings on exorcism and demonology. He served as the association's president until his retirement in 2000.\n\n**Exorcisms**\n\nThroughout his career, Amorth performed an estimated 160,000 exorcisms, making him one of the most experienced exorcists in the world. Each exorcism, according to Amorth, represented a single prayer or ritual, and some possessed individuals required hundreds of exorcisms to overcome their spiritual afflictions.\n\nAmorth's approach to exorcism was rooted in the Catholic Church's teachings on demonology and the sacraments. He believed that exorcisms should only be performed by trained and authorized priests, and that they should be conducted with the utmost reverence and respect for the sacred.\n\n**Books**\n\nAmorth wrote two memoirs of his time as an exorcist: \"An Exorcist Tells His Story\" and \"An Exorcist: More Stories.\" These books provide a unique glimpse into the world of exorcism and offer practical guidance on recognizing and overcoming demonic possession.\n\nIn \"An Exorcist Tells His Story,\" Amorth recounts his experiences as an exorcist, including his encounters with possessed individuals and his struggles with the spiritual forces of darkness. The book also offers practical advice on how to recognize the signs of demonic possession and how to pray effectively for those who are afflicted.\n\nIn \"An Exorcist: More Stories,\" Amorth shares more of his experiences as an exorcist, including his encounters with curses and spiritual afflictions. The book also explores the topic of demonic contraction and offers guidance on how to prevent and overcome it.\n\n**In Film**\n\nThe 2017 American documentary film \"The Devil and Father Amorth\" presents Amorth at work in an Italian village, performing an exorcism on a young woman who is possessed by a demonic entity. The film offers a unique glimpse into the world of exorcism and provides a fascinating look at Amorth's approach to this sacred ministry.\n\n**Views**\n\nAt a film festival in Umbria, Amorth was invited to introduce the 2011 film about exorcism called \"The Rite.\" During the introduction, he expressed his concerns about the dangers of yoga and the practice of Eastern religions. Amorth believed that yoga leads to the practice of Hinduism and is therefore satanic. He also expressed his concerns about the practice of Eastern religions, which he believed are based on a false belief in reincarnation.\n\nAmorth's views on yoga and Eastern religions were not limited to this film festival introduction. He often expressed his concerns about these topics in his writings and interviews, and he believed that they posed a significant threat to the spiritual well-being of Catholics.\n\n**Disappearance of Emanuela Orlandi**\n\nIn 1983, a Vatican City schoolgirl named Emanuela Orlandi disappeared in Rome. Amorth claimed that Orlandi was kidnapped for a sex party by a gang involving Vatican police and foreign diplomats. He also believed that she was later murdered and her body disposed of.\n\nAmorth's claims about Orlandi's disappearance were never proven, and the case remains a mystery to this day. However, his claims reflect his concerns about the spiritual darkness that can exist within the Church and his desire to expose the truth about such events.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* Amorth, G.

{"title": "Burkina_Faso", "content": "\nEtymology\nFormerly the Republic of Upper Volta, the country was renamed \"Burkina Faso\" on 4 August 1984 by then-President Thomas Sankara The words \"Burkina\" and \"Faso\" stem from different languages spoken in the country: \"Burkina\" comes from Mooré and means \"upright\", showing how the people are proud of their integrity, while \"Faso\" comes from the Dioula language (as written in N'Ko: ߝߊ߬ߛߏ߫ faso) and means \"fatherland\" (literally, \"father's house\") The \"-bé\" suffix added onto \"Burkina\" to form the demonym \"Burkinabé\" comes from the Fula language and means \"women or men\" [21] The CIA summarizes the etymology as \"land of the honest (incorruptible) men\" [22]\n\n\nHistory\nThe northwestern part of present-day Burkina Faso was populated by hunter-gatherers from 14,000 BCE to 5,000 BCE Their tools, including scrapers, chisels and arrowheads, were discovered in 1973 through archaeological excavations [24] Agricultural settlements were established between 3600 and 2600 BCE [24] The Bura culture was an Iron-Age civilization centred in the southwest portion of modern-day Niger and in the southeast part of contemporary Burkina Faso [25] Iron industry, in smelting and forging for tools and weapons, had developed in Sub-Saharan Africa by 1200 BCE [26] [27] To date, the oldest evidence of iron smelting found in Burkina Faso dates from 800 to 700 BCE and forms part of the Ancient Ferrous Metallurgy World Heritage Site [28] From the 3rd to the 13th centuries CE, the Iron Age Bura culture existed in the territory of present-day southeastern Burkina Faso and southwestern Niger Various ethnic groups of present-day Burkina Faso, such as the Mossi, Fula and Dioula, arrived in successive waves between the 8th and 15th centuries From the 11th century, the Mossi people established several separate kingdoms.\n\n\nEarly history\nThe northwestern part of present-day Burkina Faso was populated by

arrived around the 15th century [30] The Dogon lived in Burkina Faso's north and northwest regions until sometime in the 15th or 16th centuries, and many of the other ethnic groups that make up the

European military officers made attempts to claim parts of what is today Burkina Faso At times these colonialists and their armies fought the local peoples; at times they forged alliances with them and made treaties The colonialist officers and their home governments also made treaties among themselves The territory of Burkina Faso was invaded by France, becoming a French protectorate in 1896 [35]\n\n\nUpper Volta (1958–1984)\nThe Republic of Upper Volta (French: République de Haute-Volta) was established on 11 December 1958 as a self-governing colony within the French Community The name Upper Volta related to the nation's location along the upper reaches of the Volta River The river's three tributaries are called the Black, White and Red Volta These were expressed in the three colors of the former national flag.\n\n\nLamizana's rule and multiple coups\nThe 1966 military coup deposed Yaméogo, suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly, and placed Lt Col Sangoulé Lamizana at the head of a government of senior army officers The army remained in power for four years On 14 June 1976, the Voltans ratified a new constitution that established a four-year transition period toward complete civilian rule Lamizana remained in power throughout the 1970s as president of military or mixed civil-military governments Lamizana's rule coincided with the beginning of the Sahel drought and famine which had a devastating impact on Upper Volta and neighboring countries After conflict over the 1976 constitution, a new constitution was written and approved in 1977 Lamizana was re-elected by open elections in 1978.\n\n\n1983 coup d'état\nInfighting developed between the right and left factions of the CSP The leader of the leftists, Capt Thomas Sankara, was appointed prime minister in January 1983, but was subsequently arrested Efforts to free him, directed by Capt Blaise Compaoré, resulted in a military coup d'état on 4 August 1983.\n\n\nBurkina Faso (since 1984)\nOn 2 August 1984, on Sankara's initiative, the country's name changed from \"Upper Volta\" to \"Burkina Faso\", or land of the honest men; (the literal translation is land of the upright men) [42] [43] [need quotation to verify] [44] [45] The presidential decree was confirmed by the National Assembly on 4 August 1984.\n\n\nCompaoré presidency\nOn 15 October 1987, Sankara and twelve other government officials were assassinated in a coup d'état organized by Blaise Compaoré, Sankara's former colleague, who took over as Burkina Faso's president He held the position until October 2014 [49] After the coup and although Sankara was known to be dead, some CDRs mounted an armed resistance to the army for several days [50] [51] [52] A majority [quantify] of Burkinabè citizens hold that France's foreign ministry, the Quai d'Orsay, was behind Compaoré in organizing the coup There is some evidence for France's support of the coup [53]\n\n\nKafando presidency\nStarting on 28 October 2014 protesters began to march and demonstrate in Ouagadougou against President Compaoré, who appeared [need quotation to verify] ready to amend the constitution and extend his 27-year rule On 30 October some protesters set fire to the parliament building [64] and took over the national TV headquarters [65] Ouagadougou International Airport closed and MPs suspended the vote on changing the constitution (the change would have allowed Compaoré to stand for re-election in 2015) Later in the day, the military dissolved all government institutions and imposed a curfew [66]\n\n\nKaboré presidency and Jihadist insurgency (2015–2023)\nGeneral elections took place on 29 November 2015 Roch Marc Christian Kaboré won the election in the first round with 53.5% of the vote, defeating businessman Zéphirin Diabré, who took 29.7% [73] Kaboré was sworn in as president on 29 December 2015 [74] Kaboré was re-elected in the general election of 22 November 2020, but his party Mouvement du Peuple pour le Progrès (MPP), failed to reach absolute parliamentary majority It secured 56 seats out of a total of 127 The Congress for Democracy and Progress (CDP), the party of former President Blaise Compaoré, was distant second with 20 seats [75]\n\n\n2022 coups d'état\nIn a successful coup on 24 January 2022, mutinying soldiers arrested and deposed President Roch Marc Christian Kaboré following gunfire [106] The Patriotic Movement for Safeguard and Restoration (MPSR) supported by the military declared itself to be in power, [107] [108] led by Lieutenant Colonel Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba [109] On 31 January, the military junta restored the constitution and appointed Damiba interim president In the aftermath of the coup, ECOWAS and the African Union suspended Burkina Faso's membership [110] [111] On 10 February, the Constitutional Council declared Damiba president [112] He was sworn in as president on 16 February [113] On 1 March 2022, the junta approved a charter allowing a military-led transition of 3 years [114] The charter provides for the transition process to be followed by the holding of elections [115] President Kaboré, who had been detained since the military junta took power, was released on 6 April 2022 [116]\n\n\nGovernment\nThe constitution of 2 June 1991 established a semi-presidential government: its parliament could be dissolved by the President of the Republic, who was to be elected for a term of seven years In 2000, the constitution was amended to reduce the presidential term to five years and set term limits to two, preventing successive re-election The amendment took effect during the 2005 elections.\n\n\nConstitution\nIn 2015, Kaboré promised to revise the 1991 constitution The revision was completed in 2018 One condition prevents any individual from serving as president for more than ten years either consecutively or intermittently and provides a method for impeaching a president A referendum on the constitution for the Fifth Republic was scheduled for 24 March 2019 [142]\n\n\nForeign relations\nBurkina Faso is a member of the G5 Sahel, Community of Sahel–Saharan States, La Francophonie, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and United Nations It is currently suspended from ECOWAS and the African Union.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe army consists of some 6,000 men in voluntary service, augmented by a part-time national People's Militia composed of civilians between 25 and 35 years of age who are trained in both military and civil duties According to Jane's Sentinel Country Risk Assessment, Burkina Faso's Army is undermanned for its force structure and poorly equipped, but has wheeled light-armour vehicles, and may have developed useful combat expertise through interventions in Liberia and elsewhere in Africa [147]\n\n\nLaw enforcement\nBurkina Faso employs numerous police and security forces, generally modeled after organizations used by French police France continues to provide significant support and training to police forces The Gendarmerie Nationale is organized along military lines, with most police services delivered at the brigade level The Gendarmerie operates under the authority of the Minister of Defence, and its members are employed chiefly in the rural areas and along borders [149]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThe country is divided into 13 administrative regions These regions encompass 45 provinces and 301 departments Each region is administered by a governor.\n\n\nGeography\nBurkina Faso lies mostly between latitudes 9° and 15° N (a small area is north of 15°), and longitudes 6° W and 3° E.\n\n\nClimate\nBurkina Faso has a primarily tropical climate with two very distinct seasons In the rainy season, the country receives between 600 and 900 mm (24 and 35 in) of rainfall; in the dry season, the harmattan – a hot dry wind from the Sahara – blows The rainy season lasts around four months, May/June to September, but is shorter in the north of the country Three climatic zones can be defined: the Sahel, the Sudan-Sahel, and the Sudan-Guinea The Sahel in the north typically receives less than 600 mm (24 in) [155] of rainfall per year and has high temperatures, 5–47 °C (41–117 °F).\n\n\nNatural resources\nBurkina Faso's natural resources include gold, manganese, limestone, marble, phosphates, pumice, and salt.\n\n\nWildlife\nBurkina Faso has a larger number of elephants than many countries in West Africa Lions, leopards and buffalo can also be found here, including the dwarf or red buffalo, a smaller reddish-brown animal which looks like a fierce kind of short-legged cow Other large predators live in Burkina Faso, such as the cheetah, the caracal or African lynx, the spotted hyena and the African wild dog, one of the continent's most endangered species [162]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe value of Burkina Faso's exports fell from $2.77 billion in 2011 to $754 million in 2012 [163] Agriculture represents 32% of its gross domestic product and occupies 80% of the working population It consists mostly of rearing livestock Especially in the south and southwest, the people grow crops of sorghum, pearl millet, maize (corn), peanuts, rice and cotton, with surpluses to be sold A large part of the economic activity of the country is funded by international aid, despite having gold ores in abundance.\n\n\nMining\nThere is mining of copper, iron, manganese, gold, cassiterite (tin ore), and phosphates [171] These operations provide employment and generate international aid Gold production increased 32% in 2011 at six gold mine sites, making Burkina Faso the fourth-largest gold producer in Africa, after South Africa, Mali and Ghana [172]\n\n\nFood insecurity\nAccording to the Global Hunger Index, a multidimensional tool used to measure and track a country's hunger levels, [174] Burkina Faso ranked 65 out of 78 countries in 2013 [175] It is estimated that there are currently over 1.5 million children who are at risk of food insecurity in Burkina Faso, with around 350,000 children who are in need of emergency medical assistance [175] However, only about a third of these children will actually receive adequate medical attention [176] Only 11.4 percent of children under the age of two receive the daily recommended number of meals [175] Stunted growth as a result of food insecurity is a severe problem in Burkina Faso, affecting at least a third of the population from 2008 to 2012 [177] Additionally, stunted children, on average, tend to complete less school than children with normal growth development, [176] further contributing to the low levels of education of the Burkina Faso population [178]\n\n\nApproaches to improving food security\nThe United Nations' World Food Programme has worked on programs that are geared towards increasing food security in Burkina Faso.\nThe Protracted Relief and Recovery Operation 200509 (PRRO) was formed to respond to the high levels of malnutrition in Burkina Faso, following the food and nutrition crisis in 2012 [183] The efforts of this project are mostly geared towards the treatment and prevention of malnutrition and include take home rations for the caretakers of those children who are being treated for malnutrition [183] Additionally, the activities of this operation contribute to families' abilities to withstand future food crises Better nutrition among the two most vulnerable groups, young children and pregnant women, prepares them to be able to respond better in times when food security is compromised, such as in droughts [183]\n\n\nWorld Food Programme\nThe United Nations' World Food Programme has worked on programs that are geared towards increasing food security in Burkina Faso.\nThe Protracted Relief and Recovery

this operation contribute to families' abilities to withstand future food crises Better nutrition among the two most vulnerable groups, young children and pregnant women, prepares them to be able to respond better in times when food security is compromised, such as in droughts [183]\n\n\nWorld Bank\nThe World Bank was established in 1944, and comprises five institutions whose shared goals are to end extreme poverty by 2030 and to promote shared prosperity by fostering income growth of the lower forty percent of every country [186] One of the main projects the World Bank is working on to reduce food insecurity in Burkina Faso is the Agricultural Productivity and Food Security Project [187] According to the World Bank, the objective of this project is to \"improve the capacity of poor producers to increase food production and to ensure improved availability of food products in rural markets.\" [187] The Agricultural Productivity and Food Security Project has three main parts Its first component is to work towards the improvement of food production, including financing grants and providing 'voucher for work' programs for households who cannot pay their contribution in cash [187] The project's next component involves improving the availability of food products, particularly in rural areas [187] This includes supporting the marketing of food products, and aims to strengthen the capabilities of stakeholders to control the variability of food products and supplies at local and national levels [187] Lastly, the third component of this project focuses on institutional development and capacity building Its goal is to reinforce the capacities of service providers and institutions who are specifically involved in project implementation [187] The project's activities aim to build capacities of service providers, strengthen the capacity of food producer organizations, strengthen agricultural input supply delivery methods, and manage and evaluate project activities [187]\n\n\nInfrastructure and services\nWhile services remain underdeveloped, the National Office for Water and Sanitation (ONEA), a state-owned utility company run along commercial lines, is emerging as one of the best-performing utility companies in Africa [189] High levels of autonomy and a skilled and dedicated management have driven ONEA's ability to improve production of and access to clean water [189]\n\n\nWater\nWhile services remain underdeveloped, the National Office for Water and Sanitation (ONEA), a state-owned utility company run along commercial

and access to clean water [189]\n\n\nElectricity\nA 33-megawatt solar power plant in Zagtouli, near Ouagadougou, came online in late November 2017 At the time of its construction, it was the largest solar power facility in West Africa [191]\n\n\nOther\nThe growth rate in Burkina Faso is high although it continues to be plagued by corruption and incursions from terrorist groups from Mali and Niger [192]\n\n\nTransport\nTransport in Burkina Faso is limited by relatively underdeveloped infrastructure.\n\n\nScience and technology\nIn 2009, Burkina Faso spent 0.20% of GDP on research and development (R&D), one of the lowest ratios in West Africa There were 48 researchers (in full-time equivalents) per million inhabitants in 2010, which is more than twice the average for sub-Saharan Africa (20 per million population in 2013) and higher than the ratio for Ghana and Nigeria (39) It is, however, much lower than the ratio for Senegal (361 per million inhabitants) In Burkina Faso in 2010, 46% of researchers were working in the health sector, 16% in engineering, 13% in natural sciences, 9% in agricultural sciences, 7% in the humanities and 4% in social sciences [195] \nIn January 2011, the government created the Ministry of Scientific Research and Innovation Up until then, management of science, technology and innovation had fallen under the Department of Secondary and Higher Education and Scientific Research Within this ministry, the Directorate General for Research and Sector Statistics is responsible for planning A separate body, the Directorate General of Scientific Research, Technology and Innovation, coordinates research This is a departure from the pattern in many other West African countries where a single body fulfills both functions The move signals the government's intention to make science and technology a development priority [195] Burkina Faso was ranked 129th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024 [196]\n\n\nDemographics\nBurkina Faso is an ethnically integrated, secular state where most people are concentrated in the south and centre, where their density sometimes exceeds 48 inhabitants per square kilometre (120/sq mi) Hundreds of thousands of Burkinabè migrate regularly to Ivory Coast and Ghana, mainly for seasonal agricultural work These flows of workers are affected by external events; the September 2002 coup attempt in Ivory Coast and the ensuing fighting meant that hundreds of thousands of Burkinabè returned to Burkina Faso The regional economy suffered when they were unable to work [199]\n\n\nEthnic groups\nBurkina Faso's 17.3 million people belong to two major West African ethnic cultural groups: the Voltaic and the Mandé (whose common language is Dioula) The Voltaic Mossi make up about one-half of the population The Mossi claim descent from warriors who migrated to present-day Burkina Faso from northern Ghana around 1100 AD They established an empire that lasted more than 800 years Predominantly farmers, the Mossi kingdom is led by the Mogho Naba, whose court is in Ouagadougou [199]\n\n\nLanguages\nBurkina Faso is a multilingual country The working languages are French, which was introduced during the colonial period, and English [17] In December 2023, due to deteriorating relations between Burkina Faso and the French government, the Burkina Faso government announced it was elevating (Mooré, Bissa, Dioula and Fula) to the status of official languages [205] In January 2024, French was dropped as an official language, becoming a working language with English instead [206] Altogether, an estimated 69 languages are spoken in the country, [207] of which about 60 languages are indigenous The Mooré language is the most spoken language in Burkina Faso, spoken by about half the population, mainly in the central region around the capital, Ouagadougou.\n\n\nHealth\nIn 2016, the average life expectancy was estimated at 60 for males and 61 for females In 2018, the under-five mortality rate and the infant mortality rate was 76 per 1000 live births [209] In 2014, the median age of its inhabitants was 17 and the estimated population growth rate was 3.05% [200]\n\n\nReligion\nThe government of Burkina Faso's 2019 census reported that 63.8% of the population practiced Islam, and that the majority of this group belong to the Sunni branch, [2] [217] while a small minority adheres to Shia Islam [218] A significant number of Sunni Muslims identify with the Tijaniyah Sufi order.\n\n\nEducation\nEducation in Burkina Faso is divided into primary, secondary and higher education [219] High school costs approximately CFA 25,000 (US$50) per year, which is far above the means of most Burkinabè families Boys receive preference in schooling; as such, girls' education and literacy rates are far lower than their male counterparts An increase in girls' schooling has been observed because of the government's policy of making school cheaper for girls and granting them more scholarships.\n\n\nCulture\nLiterature in Burkina Faso is based on the oral tradition, which remains important In 1934, during French occupation, Dim-Dolobsom Ouedraogo published his Maximes, pensées et devinettes mossi (Maxims, Thoughts and Riddles of the Mossi), a record of the oral history of the Mossi people [221]\n\n\nArts and crafts\nIn addition to several rich traditional artistic heritages among the peoples, there is a large artist community in Burkina Faso, especially in Ouagadougou Much of the crafts produced are for the country's growing tourist industry.\n\n\nCuisine\nTypical of West African cuisine, Burkina Faso's cuisine is based on staple foods of sorghum, millet, rice, maize, peanuts, potatoes, beans, yams and okra [227] The most common sources of animal protein are chicken, chicken eggs and freshwater fish A typical Burkinabè beverage is Banji or Palm Wine, which is fermented palm sap; and Zoom-kom, or \"grain water\" purportedly the national drink of Burkina Faso Zoom-kom is milky-looking and whitish, having a water and cereal base, best drunk with ice cubes In the more rural regions, in the outskirts of Burkina, you would find Dolo, which is drink made from fermented millet [228] In times of crisis, one legume native to Burkina, Zamnè, can be served as a main dish or in a sauce [229]\n\n\nCinema\nThe cinema of Burkina Faso is an important part of the West African film industry and African film as a whole [230] Burkina's contribution to African cinema started with the establishment of the film festival FESPACO (Festival Panafricain du Cinéma et de la Télévision de Ouagadougou), which was launched as a film week in 1969 Many of the nation's filmmakers are known internationally and have won international prizes.\n\n\nSports\nSport in Burkina Faso is widespread and includes football, basketball, cycling, rugby union, handball, tennis, boxing and martial arts Football is the most popular sport in Burkina Faso, played both professionally, and informally in towns and villages across the country The national team is nicknamed \"Les Etalons\" (\"the Stallions\") in reference to the legendary horse of Princess Yennenga.\n\n\nMusic\nThe music of Burkina Faso includes the folk music of 60 different ethnic groups The Mossi people, centrally located around the capital, Ouagadougou, account for 40% of the population while, to the south, Gurunsi, Gurma, Dagaaba and Lobi populations, speaking Gur languages closely related to the Mossi language, extend into the coastal states In the north and east the Fulani of the Sahel preponderate, while in the south and west the Mande languages are common; Samo, Bissa, Bobo, Senufo and Marka Burkinabé traditional music has continued to thrive and musical output remains quite diverse Popular music is mostly in French: Burkina Faso has yet to produce a major pan-African success.\n\n\nMedia\nThe nation's principal media outlet is its state-sponsored combined television and radio service, Radio Télévision du Burkina (RTB) [236] RTB broadcasts on two medium-wave (AM) and several FM frequencies Besides RTB, there are privately owned sports, cultural, music, and religious FM radio stations RTB maintains a worldwide short-wave news broadcast (Radio Nationale Burkina) in the French language from the capital at Ouagadougou using a 100 kW transmitter on 4.815 and 5.030 MHz [237]\n\n\nCultural festivals and events\nEvery two years, Ouagadougou hosts the Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou (FESPACO), the largest African cinema festival on the continent (February, odd years).\n\n\nSee also\n12°20′N 1°50′W﻿ / ﻿12.333°N 1.833°W﻿ / 12.333; -1.833\n\n\nNotes\n12°20′N 1°50′W﻿ / ﻿12.333°N 1.833°W﻿ / 12.333;

the Republic of Upper Volta, is a landlocked country located in West Africa. It is bordered by Mali to the northwest, Niger to the northeast, Benin to the southeast, Togo and Ghana to the south, and Côte d'Ivoire to the southwest. The country has a diverse geography, with savannas, grasslands, and deserts covering most of its territory. The capital and largest city is Ouagadougou, which is also the country's economic and cultural center.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name \"Burkina Faso\" was adopted on 4 August 1984 by then-President Thomas Sankara. The word \"Burkina\" comes from the Mooré language and means \"upright.\" It symbolizes the country's pride and integrity. The word \"Faso\" comes from the Dioula language and means \"fatherland\" or \"father's house.\" The suffix \"-bé\" added onto \"Burkina\" to form the demonym \"Burkinabé\" comes from the Fula language and means \"women or men.\" This name change reflected the country's desire to break away from its colonial past and forge a new identity.\n\nEarly History\n\nThe northwestern part of present-day Burkina Faso was populated by hunter-gatherers from 14,000 BCE to 5,000 BCE. Archaeological excavations in 1973 uncovered their tools, including scrapers, chisels, and arrowheads. Agricultural settlements were established between 3600 and 2600 BCE. The Bura culture, an Iron-Age civilization, flourished in the southwest region of modern-day Niger and southeastern Burkina Faso between the 3rd and 13rd centuries CE. The Mossi people, who arrived in the region between the 8th and 15th centuries, established several separate kingdoms.\n\n8th to 18th Centuries\n\nThe Proto-Mossi arrived in the far eastern part of present-day Burkina Faso between the 8th and 11th centuries and accepted Islam as their religion in the 11th century. The Samo arrived around the 15th century. The Dogon lived in Burkina Faso's north and northwest regions until sometime in the 15th or 16th centuries. Many other ethnic groups that make up the country's population arrived in the region during this time.\n\nFrom Colony to Independence (1890s-1958)\n\nThe European Scramble for Africa led to the invasion of Burkina Faso by France in the late 19th century. The territory became a French protectorate in 1896. The French colonial administration made treaties with local leaders and imposed its own system of governance. The country was ruled by a mix of French and local officials until it gained independence on 5 August 1960.\n\nUpper Volta (1958-1984)\n\nThe Republic of Upper Volta, as the country was known from 1958 to 1984, was established as a self-governing colony within the French Community. The name Upper Volta referred to the nation's location along the upper reaches of the Volta River. The river's three tributaries, the Black, White, and Red Volta, were expressed in the three colors of the former national flag.\n\nLamizana's Rule and Multiple Coups\n\nYaméogo was overthrown in a military coup in 1966, and Lt Col Sangoulé Lamizana took power. The army remained in control for four years. In 1976, a new constitution was written and approved, establishing a four-year transition period toward complete civilian rule. Lamizana remained in power throughout the 1970s, despite the beginning of the Sahel drought and famine that had a devastating impact on the country.\n\n1983 Coup d'Etat\n\nA military coup led by Blaise Compaoré and Capt Thomas Sankara resulted in the overthrow of Lamizana in 1983. Sankara became the new president, and his government implemented radical policies aimed at transforming the country and promoting social justice.\n\nBurkina Faso (Since 1984)\n\nSankara's presidency was marked by a series of initiatives aimed at reducing poverty and promoting social equality. He also implemented policies aimed at promoting women's rights and improving the country's infrastructure. Sankara was assassinated in a coup led by Blaise Compaoré in 1987. Compaoré remained in power until 2014, when he was overthrown in a popular uprising.\n\nKaboré Presidency and Jihadist Insurgency (2015-2023)\n\nRoch Marc Christian Kaboré won the presidential election in 2015 and was sworn in as president. His government faced challenges from a growing jihadist insurgency in the north and east of the country. The government responded with military action and sought international support to combat the threat.\n\n2022 Coups d'Etat\n\nA military coup led by Lieutenant Colonel Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba resulted in the overthrow of President Kaboré in January 2022. The Patriotic Movement for Safeguard and Restoration, led by Damiba, declared itself in power. The coup was widely condemned by the international community.\n\nGovernment\n\nThe constitution of 1991 established a semi-presidential government. The president is elected for a five-year term, and the prime minister is appointed by the president. The government is divided into three branches: the executive, the legislative, and the judicial.\n\nConstitution\n\nIn 2018, a new constitution was adopted, which provides for a more decentralized system of government and greater protection of individual rights. The constitution also establishes a new electoral system and provides for the creation of a national council for the promotion of human rights.\n\nForeign Relations\n\nBurkina Faso is a member of several international organizations, including the United Nations, the African Union, and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The country has diplomatic relations with many countries around the world and participates in several regional and international organizations.\n\nMilitary\n\nThe Burkinabé army is a landlocked military force responsible for defending the country's borders and maintaining internal security. The army is equipped with a mix of modern and outdated equipment, including tanks, artillery, and small arms.\n\nLaw Enforcement\n\nThe Burkinabé police force is responsible for maintaining law and order in the country. The police force is divided into several branches, including the Gendarmerie Nationale, the National Police, and the Municipal Police.\n\nAdministrative Divisions\n\nBurkina Faso is divided into 13 administrative regions, which are further divided into 45 provinces and 301 departments. Each region is administered by a governor, who is appointed by the president.\n\nGeography\n\nBurkina Faso is a landlocked country located in West Africa, bordered by five countries: Mali to the northwest, Niger to the northeast, Benin to the southeast, Togo and Ghana to the south, and Côte d'Ivoire to the southwest. The country has a diverse geography, with savannas, grasslands, and deserts covering most of its territory.\n\nClimate\n\nBurkina Faso has a primarily tropical climate with two distinct seasons: a wet season and a dry season. The wet season typically runs from May to September, and the dry season from October to April. The country experiences a significant temperature range, with temperatures varying from 10°C to 40°C throughout the year.\n\nNatural Resources\n\nBurkina Faso has a variety of natural resources, including gold, manganese, limestone, marble, phosphates, pumice, and salt. The country is also rich in water resources, with several major rivers and lakes.\n\nWildlife\n\nBurkina Faso is home to a diverse range of wildlife, including elephants, lions, leopards, and buffalo.

Links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Burkina_Faso\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nFormerly the Republic of Upper Volta, the country was renamed \"Burkina Faso\" on 4 August 1984 by then-President Thomas Sankara The words \"Burkina\" and \"Faso\" stem from different languages spoken in the country: \"Burkina\" comes from Mooré and means \"upright\", showing how the people are proud of their integrity, while \"Faso\" comes from the Dioula language (as written in N'Ko: ߝߊ߬ߛߏ߫ faso) and means \"fatherland\" (literally, \"father's house\") The \"-bé\" suffix added onto \"Burkina\" to form the demonym \"Burkinabé\" comes from the Fula language and means \"women or men\" [21] The CIA summarizes the etymology as \"land of the honest (incorruptible) men\" [22]\n\n\nHistory\nThe northwestern part of present-day Burkina Faso was populated by hunter-gatherers from 14,000 BCE to 5,000 BCE Their tools, including scrapers, chisels and arrowheads, were discovered in 1973 through archaeological excavations [24] Agricultural settlements were established between 3600 and 2600 BCE [24] The Bura culture was an Iron-Age civilization centred in the southwest portion of modern-day Niger and in the southeast part of contemporary Burkina Faso [25] Iron industry, in smelting and forging for tools and weapons, had developed in Sub-Saharan Africa by 1200 BCE [26] [27] To date, the oldest evidence of iron smelting found in Burkina Faso dates from 800 to 700 BCE and forms part of the Ancient Ferrous Metallurgy World Heritage Site [28] From the 3rd to the 13th centuries CE, the Iron Age Bura culture existed in the territory of present-day southeastern Burkina Faso and southwestern Niger Various ethnic groups of present-day Burkina Faso, such as the Mossi, Fula and Dioula, arrived in successive waves between the 8th and 15th centuries From the 11th century, the Mossi people established several separate kingdoms.\n\n\nEarly history\nThe northwestern part of present-day Burkina Faso was populated by hunter-gatherers from 14,000 BCE to 5,000 BCE Their tools, including scrapers, chisels and arrowheads,

the Mossi, Fula and Dioula, arrived in successive waves between the 8th and 15th centuries From the 11th century, the Mossi people established several separate kingdoms.\n\n\n8th to 18th centuries\nThere is debate about the exact dates when Burkina Faso's many ethnic groups arrived to the area The Proto-Mossi arrived in the far eastern part of what is today Burkina Faso sometime between the 8th and 11th centuries, and accepted Islam as their religion in the 11th century [29] The Samo arrived around the 15th century [30] The Dogon lived in Burkina Faso's north and northwest regions until sometime in the 15th or 16th centuries, and many of the other ethnic groups that make up the country's population arrived in the region during this time [31]\n\n\nFrom colony to independence (1890s–1958)\nStarting in the early 1890s during the European Scramble for Africa, a series of European military officers made attempts to claim parts of what is today Burkina Faso At times these colonialists and their armies fought the local peoples; at times they forged alliances with them and made treaties The colonialist officers and their home governments also made treaties among themselves The territory of Burkina Faso was invaded by France, becoming a French protectorate in 1896 [35]\n\n\nUpper Volta (1958–1984)\nThe Republic of Upper Volta (French: République de Haute-Volta) was established on 11 December 1958 as a self-governing colony within the French Community The name Upper Volta related to the nation's location along the upper reaches of the Volta River The river's three tributaries are called the Black, White and Red Volta These were expressed in the three colors of the former national flag.\n\n\nLamizana's rule and multiple coups\nThe 1966 military coup deposed Yaméogo, suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly, and placed Lt Col Sangoulé Lamizana at the head of a government of senior army officers The army remained in power for four years On 14 June 1976, the Voltans ratified a new constitution that established a four-year transition period toward complete civilian rule Lamizana remained in power throughout the 1970s as president of military or mixed civil-military governments Lamizana's rule coincided with the beginning of the Sahel drought and famine which had a devastating impact on Upper Volta and neighboring countries After conflict over the 1976 constitution, a new constitution was written and approved in 1977 Lamizana was re-elected by open elections in 1978.\n\n\n1983 coup d'état\nInfighting developed between the right and left factions of the CSP The leader of the leftists, Capt Thomas Sankara, was appointed prime minister in January 1983, but was subsequently arrested Efforts to free him, directed by Capt Blaise Compaoré, resulted in a military coup d'état on 4 August 1983.\n\n\nBurkina Faso (since 1984)\nOn 2 August 1984, on Sankara's initiative, the country's name changed from \"Upper Volta\" to \"Burkina Faso\", or land of the honest men; (the literal translation is land of the upright men) [42] [43] [need quotation to verify] [44] [45] The presidential decree was confirmed by the National Assembly on 4 August 1984.\n\n\nCompaoré presidency\nOn 15 October 1987, Sankara and twelve other government officials were assassinated in a coup d'état organized by Blaise Compaoré, Sankara's former colleague, who took over as Burkina Faso's president He held the position until October 2014 [49] After the coup and although Sankara was known to be dead, some CDRs mounted an armed resistance to the army for several days [50] [51] [52] A majority [quantify] of Burkinabè citizens hold that France's foreign ministry, the Quai d'Orsay, was behind Compaoré in organizing the coup There is some evidence for France's support of the coup [53]\n\n\nKafando presidency\nStarting on 28 October 2014 protesters began to march and demonstrate in Ouagadougou against President Compaoré, who appeared [need quotation to verify] ready to amend the constitution and extend his 27-year rule On 30 October some protesters set fire to the parliament building [64] and took over the national TV headquarters [65] Ouagadougou International Airport closed and MPs suspended the vote on changing the constitution (the change would have allowed Compaoré to stand for re-election in 2015) Later in the day, the military dissolved all government institutions and imposed a curfew [66]\n\n\nKaboré presidency and Jihadist insurgency (2015–2023)\nGeneral elections took place on 29 November 2015 Roch Marc Christian Kaboré won the election in the first round with 53.5% of the vote, defeating businessman Zéphirin Diabré, who took 29.7% [73] Kaboré was sworn in as president on 29 December 2015 [74] Kaboré was re-elected in the general election of 22 November 2020, but his party Mouvement du Peuple pour le Progrès (MPP), failed to reach absolute parliamentary majority It secured 56 seats out of a total of 127 The Congress for Democracy and Progress (CDP), the party of former President Blaise Compaoré, was distant second with 20 seats [75]\n\n\n2022 coups d'état\nIn a successful coup on 24 January 2022, mutinying soldiers arrested and deposed President Roch Marc Christian Kaboré following gunfire [106] The Patriotic Movement for Safeguard and Restoration (MPSR) supported by the military declared itself to be in power, [107] [108] led by Lieutenant Colonel Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba [109] On 31 January, the military junta restored the constitution and appointed Damiba interim president In the aftermath of the coup, ECOWAS and the African Union suspended Burkina Faso's membership [110] [111] On 10 February, the Constitutional Council declared Damiba president [112] He was sworn in as president on 16 February [113] On 1 March 2022, the junta approved a charter allowing a military-led transition of 3 years [114] The charter provides for the transition process to be followed by the holding of elections [115] President Kaboré, who had been detained since the military junta took power, was released on 6 April 2022 [116]\n\n\nGovernment\nThe constitution of 2 June 1991 established a semi-presidential government: its parliament could be dissolved by the President of the Republic, who was to be elected for a term of seven years In 2000, the constitution was amended to reduce the presidential term to five years and set term limits to two, preventing successive re-election The amendment took effect during the 2005 elections.\n\n\nConstitution\nIn 2015, Kaboré promised to revise the 1991 constitution The revision was completed in 2018 One condition prevents any individual from serving as president for more than ten years either consecutively or intermittently and provides a method for impeaching a president A referendum on the constitution for the Fifth Republic was scheduled for 24 March 2019 [142]\n\n\nForeign relations\nBurkina Faso is a member of the G5 Sahel, Community of Sahel–Saharan States, La Francophonie, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and United Nations It is currently suspended from ECOWAS and the African Union.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe army consists of some 6,000 men in voluntary service, augmented by a part-time national People's Militia composed of civilians between 25 and 35 years of age who are trained in both military and civil duties According to Jane's Sentinel Country Risk Assessment, Burkina Faso's Army is undermanned for its force structure and poorly equipped, but has wheeled light-armour vehicles, and may have developed useful combat expertise through interventions in Liberia and elsewhere in Africa [147]\n\n\nLaw enforcement\nBurkina Faso employs numerous police and security forces, generally modeled after organizations used by French police France continues to provide significant support and training to police forces The Gendarmerie Nationale is organized along military lines, with most police services delivered at the brigade level The Gendarmerie operates under the authority of the Minister of Defence, and its members are employed chiefly in the rural areas and along borders [149]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThe country is divided into 13 administrative regions These regions encompass 45 provinces and 301 departments Each region is administered by a governor.\n\n\nGeography\nBurkina Faso lies mostly between latitudes 9° and 15° N (a small area is north of 15°), and longitudes 6° W and 3° E.\n\n\nClimate\nBurkina Faso has a primarily tropical climate with two very distinct seasons In the rainy season, the country receives between 600 and 900 mm (24 and 35 in) of rainfall; in the dry season, the harmattan – a hot dry wind from the Sahara – blows The rainy season lasts around four months, May/June to September, but is shorter in the north of the country Three climatic zones can be defined: the Sahel, the Sudan-Sahel, and the Sudan-Guinea The Sahel in the north typically receives less than 600 mm (24 in) [155] of rainfall per year and has high temperatures, 5–47 °C (41–117 °F).\n\n\nNatural resources\nBurkina Faso's natural resources include gold, manganese, limestone, marble, phosphates, pumice, and salt.\n\n\nWildlife\nBurkina Faso has a larger number of elephants than many countries in West Africa Lions, leopards and buffalo can also be found here, including the dwarf or red buffalo, a smaller reddish-brown animal which looks like a fierce kind of short-legged cow Other large predators live in Burkina Faso, such as the cheetah, the caracal or African lynx, the spotted hyena and the African wild dog, one of the continent's most endangered species [162]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe value of Burkina Faso's exports fell from $2.77 billion in 2011 to $754 million in 2012 [163] Agriculture represents 32% of its gross domestic product and occupies 80% of the working population It consists mostly of rearing livestock Especially in the south and southwest, the people grow crops of sorghum, pearl millet, maize (corn), peanuts, rice and cotton, with surpluses to be sold A large part of the economic activity of the country is funded by international aid, despite having gold ores in abundance.\n\n\nMining\nThere is mining of copper, iron, manganese, gold, cassiterite (tin ore), and phosphates [171] These operations provide employment and generate international aid Gold production increased 32% in 2011 at six gold mine sites, making Burkina Faso the fourth-largest gold producer in Africa, after South Africa, Mali and Ghana [172]\n\n\nFood insecurity\nAccording to the Global Hunger Index, a multidimensional tool used to measure and track a country's hunger levels, [174] Burkina Faso ranked 65 out of 78 countries in 2013 [175] It is estimated that there are currently over 1.5 million children who are at risk of food insecurity in Burkina Faso, with around 350,000 children who are in need of emergency medical assistance [175] However, only about a third of these children will actually receive adequate medical attention [176] Only 11.4 percent of children under the age of two receive the daily recommended number of meals [175] Stunted growth as a result of food insecurity is a severe problem in Burkina Faso, affecting at least a third of the population from 2008 to 2012 [177] Additionally, stunted children, on average, tend to complete less school than children with normal growth development, [176] further contributing to the low levels of education of the Burkina Faso population [178]\n\n\nApproaches to improving food security\nThe United Nations' World Food Programme has worked on programs that are geared towards increasing food security in Burkina Faso.\nThe Protracted Relief and Recovery Operation 200509 (PRRO) was formed to respond to the high levels of malnutrition in Burkina Faso, following the food and nutrition crisis in 2012 [183] The efforts of this project are mostly geared towards the treatment and prevention of malnutrition and include take home rations for the caretakers of those children who are being treated for malnutrition [183] Additionally, the activities of this operation contribute to families' abilities to withstand future food crises Better nutrition among the two most vulnerable groups, young children and pregnant women, prepares them to be able to respond better in times when food security is compromised, such as in droughts [183]\n\n\nWorld Food Programme\nThe United Nations' World Food Programme has worked

[183]\n\n\nWorld Bank\nThe World Bank was established in 1944, and comprises five institutions whose shared goals are to end extreme poverty by 2030 and to promote shared prosperity by fostering income growth of the lower forty percent of every country [186] One of the main projects the World Bank is working on to reduce food insecurity in Burkina Faso is the Agricultural Productivity and Food Security Project [187] According to the World Bank, the objective of this project is to \"improve the capacity of poor producers to increase food production and to ensure improved availability of food products in rural markets.\" [187] The Agricultural Productivity and Food Security Project has three main parts Its first component is to work towards the improvement of food production, including financing grants and providing 'voucher for work' programs for households who cannot pay their contribution in cash [187] The project's next component involves improving the availability of food products, particularly in rural areas [187] This includes supporting the marketing of food products, and aims to strengthen the capabilities of stakeholders to control the variability of food products and supplies at local and national levels [187] Lastly, the third component of this project focuses on institutional development and capacity building Its goal is to reinforce the capacities of service providers and institutions who are specifically involved in project implementation [187] The project's activities aim to build capacities of service providers, strengthen the capacity of food producer organizations, strengthen agricultural input supply delivery methods, and manage and evaluate project activities [187]\n\n\nInfrastructure and services\nWhile services remain underdeveloped, the National Office for Water and Sanitation (ONEA), a state-owned utility company run along commercial lines, is emerging as one of the best-performing utility companies in Africa [189] High levels of autonomy and a skilled and dedicated management have driven ONEA's ability to improve production of and access to clean water [189]\n\n\nWater\nWhile services remain

plant in Zagtouli, near Ouagadougou, came online in late November 2017 At the time of its construction, it was the largest solar power facility in West Africa [191]\n\n\nOther\nThe growth rate in Burkina Faso is high although it continues to be plagued by corruption and incursions from terrorist groups from Mali and Niger [192]\n\n\nTransport\nTransport in Burkina Faso is limited by relatively underdeveloped infrastructure.\n\n\nScience and technology\nIn 2009, Burkina Faso spent 0.20% of GDP on research and development (R&D), one of the lowest ratios in West Africa There were 48 researchers (in full-time equivalents) per million inhabitants in 2010, which is more than twice the average for sub-Saharan Africa (20 per million population in 2013) and higher than the ratio for Ghana and Nigeria (39) It is, however, much lower than the ratio for Senegal (361 per million inhabitants) In Burkina Faso in 2010, 46% of researchers were working in the health sector, 16% in engineering, 13% in natural sciences, 9% in agricultural sciences, 7% in the humanities and 4% in social sciences [195] \nIn January 2011, the government created the Ministry of Scientific Research and Innovation Up until then, management of science, technology and innovation had fallen under the Department of Secondary and Higher Education and Scientific Research Within this ministry, the Directorate General for Research and Sector Statistics is responsible for planning A separate body, the Directorate General of Scientific Research, Technology and Innovation, coordinates research This is a departure from the pattern in many other West African countries where a single body fulfills both functions The move signals the government's intention to make science and technology a development priority [195] Burkina Faso was ranked 129th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024 [196]\n\n\nDemographics\nBurkina Faso is an ethnically integrated, secular state where most people are concentrated in the south and centre, where their density sometimes exceeds 48 inhabitants per square kilometre (120/sq mi) Hundreds of thousands of Burkinabè migrate regularly to Ivory Coast and Ghana, mainly for seasonal agricultural work These flows of workers are affected by external events; the September 2002 coup attempt in Ivory Coast and the ensuing fighting meant that hundreds of thousands of Burkinabè returned to Burkina Faso The regional economy suffered when they were unable to work [199]\n\n\nEthnic groups\nBurkina Faso's 17.3 million people belong to two major West African ethnic cultural groups: the Voltaic and the Mandé (whose common language is Dioula) The Voltaic Mossi make up about one-half of the population The Mossi claim descent from warriors who migrated to present-day Burkina Faso from northern Ghana around 1100 AD They established an empire that lasted more than 800 years Predominantly farmers, the Mossi kingdom is led by the Mogho Naba, whose court is in Ouagadougou [199]\n\n\nLanguages\nBurkina Faso is a multilingual country The working languages are French, which was introduced during the colonial period, and English [17] In December 2023, due to deteriorating relations between Burkina Faso and the French government, the Burkina Faso government announced it was elevating (Mooré, Bissa, Dioula and Fula) to the status of official languages [205] In January 2024, French was dropped as an official language, becoming a working language with English instead [206] Altogether, an estimated 69 languages are spoken in the country, [207] of which about 60 languages are indigenous The Mooré language is the most spoken language in Burkina Faso, spoken by about half the population, mainly in the central region around the capital, Ouagadougou.\n\n\nHealth\nIn 2016, the average life expectancy was estimated at 60 for males and 61 for females In 2018, the under-five mortality rate and the infant mortality rate was 76 per 1000 live births [209] In 2014, the median age of its inhabitants was 17 and the estimated population growth rate was 3.05% [200]\n\n\nReligion\nThe government of Burkina Faso's 2019 census reported that 63.8% of the population practiced Islam, and that the majority of this group belong to the Sunni branch, [2] [217] while a small minority adheres to Shia Islam [218] A significant number of Sunni Muslims identify with the Tijaniyah Sufi order.\n\n\nEducation\nEducation in Burkina Faso is divided into primary, secondary and higher education [219] High school costs approximately CFA 25,000 (US$50) per year, which is far above the means of most Burkinabè families Boys receive preference in schooling; as such, girls' education and literacy rates are far lower than their male counterparts An increase in girls' schooling has been observed because of the government's policy of making school cheaper for girls and granting them more scholarships.\n\n\nCulture\nLiterature in Burkina Faso is based on the oral tradition, which remains important In 1934, during French occupation, Dim-Dolobsom Ouedraogo published his Maximes, pensées et devinettes mossi (Maxims, Thoughts and Riddles of the Mossi), a record of the oral history of the Mossi people [221]\n\n\nArts and crafts\nIn addition to several rich traditional artistic heritages among the peoples, there is a large artist community in Burkina Faso, especially in Ouagadougou Much of the crafts produced are for the country's growing tourist industry.\n\n\nCuisine\nTypical of West African cuisine, Burkina Faso's cuisine is based on staple foods of sorghum, millet, rice, maize, peanuts, potatoes, beans, yams and okra [227] The most common sources of animal protein are chicken, chicken eggs and freshwater fish A typical Burkinabè beverage is Banji or Palm Wine, which is fermented palm sap; and Zoom-kom, or \"grain water\" purportedly the national drink of Burkina Faso Zoom-kom is milky-looking and whitish, having a water and cereal base, best drunk with ice cubes In the more rural regions, in the outskirts of Burkina, you would find Dolo, which is drink made from fermented millet [228] In times of crisis, one legume native to Burkina, Zamnè, can be served as a main dish or in a sauce [229]\n\n\nCinema\nThe cinema of Burkina Faso is an important part of the West African film industry and African film as a whole [230] Burkina's contribution to African cinema started with the establishment of the film festival FESPACO (Festival Panafricain du Cinéma et de la Télévision de Ouagadougou), which was launched as a film week in 1969 Many of the nation's filmmakers are known internationally and have won international prizes.\n\n\nSports\nSport in Burkina Faso is widespread and includes football, basketball, cycling, rugby union, handball, tennis, boxing and martial arts Football is the most popular sport in Burkina Faso, played both professionally, and informally in towns and villages across the country The national team is nicknamed \"Les Etalons\" (\"the Stallions\") in reference to the legendary horse of Princess Yennenga.\n\n\nMusic\nThe music of Burkina Faso includes the folk music of 60 different ethnic groups The Mossi people, centrally located around the capital, Ouagadougou, account for 40% of the population while, to the south, Gurunsi, Gurma, Dagaaba and Lobi populations, speaking Gur languages closely related to the Mossi language, extend into the coastal states In the north and east the Fulani of the Sahel preponderate, while in the south and west the Mande languages are common; Samo, Bissa, Bobo, Senufo and Marka Burkinabé traditional music has continued to thrive and musical output remains quite diverse Popular music is mostly in French: Burkina Faso has yet to produce a major pan-African success.\n\n\nMedia\nThe nation's principal media outlet is its state-sponsored combined television and radio service, Radio Télévision du Burkina (RTB) [236] RTB broadcasts on two medium-wave (AM) and several FM frequencies Besides RTB, there are privately owned sports, cultural, music, and religious FM radio stations RTB maintains a worldwide short-wave news

Her mother, Gertrude Hoelzer, was a German immigrant who brought with her a rich cultural heritage. Razdan's father, Narendra Nath Razdan, was an Indian national of Kashmiri Pandit descent, who had a deep understanding of Indian classical music and literature. This diverse background would later shape Razdan's interests and career choices.\n\nGrowing up in a multicultural environment, Razdan was exposed to various art forms, including music, dance, and theater.

the Olympics prior to the Paralympic Games was Lis Hartel, a Danish equestrian athlete who had contracted polio in 1943 and won a silver medal in the dressage event in the 1952 Summer Olympics [7]\n\n\nStoke Mandeville Games\nThe first organized athletic event for athletes with disabilities that coincided with the Olympic Games took place on the day of the opening of the 1948 Summer Olympics in London The German-Jewish doctor Ludwig Guttmann, of Stoke Mandeville Hospital, [8] who had fled Nazi Germany with the help of the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (CARA) in 1939, [9] hosted a sports competition for British World War II veteran patients with spinal cord injuries The first games were called the 1948 International Wheelchair Games, and were intended to coincide with the 1948 Olympics [10] Guttman's aim was to create an elite sports competition for people with disabilities that would be equivalent to the Olympic Games The games were held at the same location each year, and in 1952 Dutch and Israeli veterans took part alongside the British, making it the first international competition of its own kind In 1960, the 9th annual games took place outside of the UK for the first time in Rome, to coincide with the 1960 Summer Olympics which were also being held in Rome These were to be later designated the 1st Paralympic Games [11]\n\n\nMilestones\nThere have been several milestones in the Paralympic movement The first official Paralympic Games, coincident with the ninth Stoke Mandeville Games but no longer open solely to war veterans, was held in Rome in 1960 [15] They were the brainchild of Antonio Maglio, a friend and follower of Guttmann and were financed almost entirely by Maglio's employer, the Workers National Accident Insurance Fund of Italy, then led by Renato Morelli, who was also Chairman of the International Social Security Association [16] Four hundred athletes from 23 countries competed at the 1960 Games Since 1960, the Paralympic Games have taken place in the same year as the Olympic Games [17] [18] The Games were initially open only to athletes in wheelchairs; at the 1976 Summer Games, athletes with different disabilities were included for the first time at a Summer Paralympics [10] With the inclusion of more disability classifications the 1976 Summer Games expanded to 1,600 athletes from 40 countries [17]\n\n\nWinter Games\nThe first Winter Paralympic Games were held in 1976 in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden This was the first Paralympics in which multiple categories of athletes with disabilities could compete [17] The Winter Games were celebrated every four years on the same year as their summer counterpart, just as the Olympics were This tradition was upheld through the 1992 Games in Albertville, France; after that, beginning with the 1994 Games, the Winter Paralympics and the Winter Olympics have been held in those even-numbered years separate from the Summer Olympics The winter games happen two years after the summer games [17]\n\n\nInternational Paralympic Committee\nThe International Paralympic Committee is the global governing body of the Paralympic Movement It comprises 178 [22] National Paralympic Committees (NPC) and four disability-specific international sports federations [23] The president of the IPC is Andrew Parsons The IPC's international headquarters are in Bonn, Germany [24] The IPC is responsible for organizing the Summer and Winter Paralympic Games It also serves as the International Federation for nine sports (Paralympic athletics, Paralympic swimming, Paralympic archery, Paralympic powerlifting, Para-alpine skiing, Paralympic biathlon, Paralympic cross-country skiing, ice sledge hockey and Wheelchair DanceSport) This requires the IPC to supervise and coordinate the World Championships and other competitions for each of the nine sports it regulates [25]\n\n\nName and symbols\nAlthough the name was originally coined as a portmanteau combining paraplegic (due to its origins as games for people with spinal injuries) and Olympic, [30] the inclusion of other disability groups meant that this was no longer considered very accurate The present formal explanation for the name is that it derives from the Greek preposition παρά, pará ('beside' or 'alongside') and thus refers to a competition held in parallel with the Olympic Games [31] The Summer Games of 1988 held in Seoul was the first time the term Paralympic came into official use.\n\n\nCeremonies\nAs mandated by the Paralympic Charter, various elements frame the opening ceremonies of the Paralympic Games Most of these rituals were established are the same that 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp and were shared with the Olympic Games [35] The Opening ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of the host country's flag and a performance of its national anthem Immediately after the welcome act and the host country anthem and hosting their flag the \"Parade of Nations\" starts with the athletes into the stadium grouped by nation Since the 1960 Summer Paralympics, the nations enter the stadium alphabetically according to the host country's or region official language, though with the host country's athletes being the last to enter Beginning with the 2020 Summer Paralympics, the succeeding hosts of the respective Olympic Games (summer or winter) will enter immediately before the current host in descending order The host nation presents artistic displays of their culture and folklore.\n\n\nOpening\nAs mandated by the Paralympic Charter, various elements frame the

will enter immediately before the current host in descending order The host nation presents artistic displays of their culture and folklore.\n\n\nClosing\nThe closing ceremony of the Paralympic Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded Flag-bearers from each participating country enter, followed by the athletes who enter together, without any national distinction.\nThe Paralympic flag is taken down Since the 1988 Winter Paralympics, with some exceptions, the national flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Paralympic Games is hoisted while the corresponding national anthem is played The games are officially closed, and the Paralympic flame is extinguished [37] After these compulsory elements, the next host nation briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theater representative of its culture.\n\n\nMedal presentation\nA medals ceremony is held after the conclusion of each Paralympic event The winner, second and third-place competitors or teams stand on top of a three-tiered rostrum when they are awarded their respective medal by an IPC member The national flags of the medalists are then raised while the national anthem of the gold medalist is played [38] Volunteering citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies, as they aid the officials who present the medals and act as flag-bearers [39] For every Paralympic event, the respective medal ceremony is held, at most, one day after the event's final.\n\n\nEquality\nIn June 2001, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) signed an agreement that would ensure that the staging of the Paralympic Games is automatically included in the bid for the Olympic Games [40] The agreement was set to take effect at the 2008 Paralympic Summer Games in Beijing and the 2010 Paralympic Winter Games in Vancouver However, the Salt Lake 2002 Organizing Committee (SLOC) chose to follow the practice of \"one bid, one city\", with one Organizing Committee for both Games, which was followed up by the 2004 Summer Games in Athens The agreement was adjusted in 2003 An extension was signed in June 2006, after some troubles at the 2006 Winter Paralympics [40] Initially agreed to remain in effect until the 2012 Summer Olympics, [17] this was later extended to encompass all Summer and Winter games up until the 2020 Summer Olympics [41] [42] Even beyond this, all Summer and Winter host cities currently [update] announced are preparing pairs of Olympic and Paralympics Games This was further confirmed when on 10 March 2018, the IOC and the IPC agreed to further extend the contract to the 2032 Summer Olympics [21]\n\n\nRelationship with the Olympics\nIn June 2001, the International Olympic

Paralympics Games This was further confirmed when on 10 March 2018, the IOC and the IPC agreed to further extend the contract to the 2032 Summer Olympics [21]\n\n\nParalympians at the Olympics\nParalympic athletes have sought equal opportunities to compete at the Olympic Games The precedent was set by Neroli Fairhall, a Paralympic archer from New Zealand, who competed at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles [50]\nIn 2008, Oscar Pistorius, a South African sprinter, attempted to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics Pistorius had both his legs amputated below the knee and races with two carbon fibre blades manufactured by Össur He holds the Paralympic world record in the 400 meter event [51] Pistorius missed qualifying for the 2008 Summer Olympics in the 400 meter race, by 0.70 seconds He qualified for the 2008 Summer Paralympics where he won gold medals in the 100, 200, and 400 meter sprints [52]\n\n\nFunding\nStarting at the 1992 Summer Paralympics, recent games have also been supported by contributions from major sponsors Unlike the Olympics, where the IOC mandates that arenas be clean of sponsor logos, the Paralympics do allow the logos of official sponsors to be displayed inside arenas and on uniforms [56]\n\n\nMedia coverage\nWhile the Olympic Games have experienced tremendous growth in global media coverage since the 1984 Summer Paralympics, the Paralympics had been slower to develop a consistent mainstream media presence In June 2023, IPC executives noted that interest in the Paralympics had been improving among broadcasters, citing that that it had already reached rights deals for the 2024 Summer Paralympics covering 75% of the world over a year in advance (in comparison to 2020, where many deals were made \"last minute\"), and that it had been pushing for broader coverage and increased rights fees since broadcasters were starting to \" [realize] that  [the Paralympics are] actually a great sporting event\", and not treat them as a low-effort obligation bundled with their Olympics rights Unlike the Olympics, the IPC holds the digital rights to the Paralympics in some markets, allowing it to promote live coverage and other highlights via its own social media platforms to engage online audiences [57]\n\n\nOutside the Games\nA 2010 study by the University of British Columbia (UBC) on the Olympic Games Impact (OGI), showed that of roughly 1,600 Canadian respondents, 41 to 50 percent believed the 2010 Paralympic and Olympic Games in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, triggered additional accessibility of buildings, sidewalks and public spaces 23 percent of employers said the Games had increased their willingness to hire people with disabilities [68]\n\n\nDown syndrome participation\nWithin the framework of the International Olympic Committee's commitment to equal access to athletics, concerns have been raised regarding inclusion of athletes with Down syndrome in the Paralympic Games While the Paralympic movement strives for inclusivity, the absence of a specific classification for athletes with Down syndrome within Paralympic swimming events raises questions about equal and fair competition for Down syndrome athletes.\n\n\nClassification\nThe International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has established ten disability categories Athletes are divided within each category according to their level of impairment, in a functional classification system which differs from sport to sport.\n\n\nCategories\nThe IPC has established ten disability categories, including physical, visual, and intellectual impairment Athletes with one of these disabilities can compete in the Paralympics, though not every sport can allow for every disability category These categories apply to both Summer and Winter Paralympics [77]\n\n\nClassification system\nWithin the disability categories, athletes are further divided into Sport Classes according to the degree of activity limitation resulting from their impairments; this aims to minimise the impact of an athlete's impairment on their sporting performance against their rivals Sport Classes are numbered, with a lower number signifying a greater level of impairment: for example, in Paralympic swimming athletes with visual impairments compete in three Sport Classes from S/SB11 to S/SB13, with S/SB11 athletes having a very low light acuity and/or no light perception, and S/SB13 athletes having the least severe visual impairment eligible for Paralympic sport [79]\n\n\nMedical classification (until the 1980s)\nFrom its inception until the 1980s, the Paralympic system for classifying athletes consisted of a medical evaluation and diagnosis of impairment An athlete's medical condition was the only factor used to determine what class they competed in For example, an athlete who had a spinal cord injury that resulted in lower limb paresis, would not compete in the same wheelchair race as an athlete with a double above-knee amputation The fact that their disability caused the same impairment did not factor into classification determination, the only consideration was their medical diagnosis It was not until views on disabled athletics shifted from just a form of rehabilitation to an end in itself, that the classification system changed from medical diagnosis to a focus on the functional abilities of the athlete [80]\n\n\nFunctional classification (since the 1980s)\nWhile there is no clear date when the shift occurred, a functional classification system became the norm for disabled athletic classification in the 1980s In a functional system, the focus is on what effect the athlete's impairment has on his or her athletic performance Under this system, athletes with total loss of function in their legs will compete together in most sports, because their functional loss is the same and the reason for the loss is immaterial The only exception to the functional system is the classification format used by International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA), which still uses a medically based system [80]\n\n\nSports\nThere are twenty-two sports on the Summer Paralympic program and six sports on the Winter Paralympics program Within some of the sports are several events For example, alpine skiing has downhill, super combined, super-G, slalom, giant slalom The IPC has governance over several of the sports but not all of them Other international organizations, known as International Sports Federations (IF), notably the International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation (IWAS), the International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA), and the Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA), govern some sports that are specific to certain disability groups [84] There are national chapters for these International Sport Federations including National Paralympic Committees, which are responsible for recruitment of athletes and governance of sports at the national level [85]\n\n\nAlleged cheating\nAfter the 2000 Sydney games, a Spanish basketball player alleged that several members of the gold medal-winning Spanish basketball team with intellectual disabilities (ID) did not have disabilities He claimed that only two athletes out of the twelve-member team met the qualifications of an athlete with an intellectual disability [86] A controversy ensued and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) called on the Spanish National Paralympic Committee to launch an investigation [87] The investigation uncovered several Spanish athletes who had flouted the ID rules In an interview with the president of the federation that oversees ID competition, Fernando Martín Vicente admitted that athletes around the world were breaking the ID eligibility rules The IPC responded by starting an investigation of its own [86] The results of the IPC's investigation confirmed the Spanish athlete's allegations and also determined that the incident was not isolated to the basketball ID event or to Spanish athletes [86] As a result, all ID competitions were suspended indefinitely [88] The ban was lifted after the 2008 Games after work had been done to tighten the criteria and controls governing admission of athletes with intellectual disabilities Four sports, swimming, athletics, table tennis and rowing, were anticipated to hold competitions for ID athletes at the 2012 Summer Paralympics [89] [90]\n\n\nNotable champions and achievements\nTrischa Zorn of the United States is the most decorated paralympian in history She competed in the blind swimming events and won a total of 55 medals, 41 of which are gold Her Paralympic career spanned 24 years from 1980 to 2004 She was also an alternate on the 1980 American Olympic swim team, but did not go to the Olympics due to a boycott by the United States and several of its allies [103] [104] Ragnhild Myklebust of Norway holds the record for the most medals ever won at the Winter Paralympic Games Competing in a variety of events between 1988 and 2002, she won a total of 22 medals, of which 17 were gold After winning five gold medals at the 2002 Games she retired at the age of 58 [105] Neroli Fairhall, a paraplegic archer from New Zealand, was the first paraplegic competitor, and the third Paralympian, to participate in the Olympic Games, when she competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles She placed thirty-fourth in the Olympic archery competition, and won a Paralympic gold medal in the same event [50]\n\n\nHost cities\na Postponed to 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, marking the first time that the Paralympic Games has been postponed They are still called the 2020 Summer Paralympics, even with the change in scheduling to one year later [138] The Games were held from 24 August to 5 September 2021 [139]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Paralympic Games\n\nThe Paralympic Games are a major international multi-sport event for athletes with physical disabilities, held every four years alongside the Olympic Games. The first Paralympic Games were held in 1960 in Rome, Italy, and have since become a premier platform for athletes with disabilities to compete and showcase their abilities.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Paralympic Games have a rich history, dating back to the early 20th century, when athletes with physical disabilities began competing in various sports events. The first athlete to compete in the Olympic Games with a disability was George Eyser, a German-American gymnast who had one artificial leg, in 1904. Since then, athletes with disabilities have competed in various events, but it wasn't until the 1960s that the Paralympic Games became a formal event.\n\n## Athletes with Disabilities at the Olympic Games\n\nBefore the advent of the Paralympic Games, athletes with disabilities competed in the Olympic Games. One of the earliest athletes to do so was Olivér Halassy, a Hungarian amputee water polo player, who competed in three successive Olympic Games, beginning in 1928. Another notable athlete was Lis Hartel, a Danish equestrian athlete who had contracted polio in 1943 and won a silver medal in the dressage event in the 1952 Summer Olympics.\n\n## Stoke Mandeville Games\n\nThe Stoke Mandeville Games were the first organized athletic event for athletes with disabilities that coincided with the Olympic Games. The games were held in 1948 at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury, England, and were hosted by Dr. Ludwig Guttmann, a German-Jewish doctor who had fled Nazi Germany in 1939. The first games were called the 1948 International Wheelchair Games, and were intended to coincide with the 1948 Olympics. The games were held annually, and in 1952, Dutch and Israeli veterans took part alongside the British, making it the first international competition of its own kind.\n\n## Milestones\n\nThere have been several milestones in the Paralympic movement. The first official Paralympic Games, coincident with the ninth Stoke Mandeville Games but no longer open solely to war veterans, was held in Rome in 1960. They were the brainchild of Antonio Maglio, a friend and follower of Guttmann, and were financed almost entirely by Maglio's employer, the Workers National Accident Insurance Fund of Italy. Four hundred athletes from 23 countries competed at the 1960 Games. Since 1960, the Paralympic Games have taken place in the same year as the Olympic Games.\n\n## Winter Games\n\nThe first Winter Paralympic Games were held in 1976 in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden. This was the first Paralympics in which multiple categories of athletes with disabilities could compete. The Winter Games were celebrated every four years on the same year as their summer counterpart, just as the Olympics were. This tradition was upheld through the 1992 Games in Albertville, France; after that, beginning with the 1994 Games, the Winter Paralympics and the Winter Olympics have been held in those even-numbered years separate from the Summer Olympics.\n\n## International Paralympic Committee\n\nThe International Paralympic Committee (IPC) is the global governing body of the Paralympic Movement. The IPC comprises 178 National Paralympic Committees (NPC) and four disability-specific international sports federations. The president of the IPC is Andrew Parsons, and the IPC's international headquarters are in Bonn, Germany. The IPC is responsible for organizing the Summer and Winter Paralympic Games and serves as the International Federation for nine sports.\n\n## Name and Symbols\n\nThe name \"Paralympic\" was coined as a portmanteau combining paraplegic and Olympic, due to its origins as games for people with spinal injuries. However, the inclusion of other disability groups meant that this was no longer considered very accurate. The present formal explanation for the name is that it derives from the Greek preposition παρά, pará ('beside' or 'alongside') and thus refers to a competition held in parallel with the Olympic Games.\n\n## Ceremonies\n\nAs mandated by the Paralympic Charter, various elements frame the opening ceremonies of the Paralympic Games. The opening ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of the host country's flag and a performance of its national anthem. Immediately after the welcome act and the host country anthem and hosting their flag, the \"Parade of Nations\" starts with the athletes into the stadium grouped by nation. Since the 1960 Summer Paralympics, the nations enter the stadium alphabetically according to the host country's or region official language, though with the host country's athletes being the last to enter.\n\n## Equality\n\nIn June 2001, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) signed an agreement that would ensure that the staging of the Paralympic Games is automatically included in the bid for the Olympic Games. The agreement was set to take effect at the 2008 Paralympic Summer Games in Beijing and the 2010 Paralympic Winter Games in Vancouver. However, the Salt Lake 2002 Organizing Committee (SLOC) chose to follow the practice of \"one bid, one city\", with one Organizing Committee for both Games, which was followed up by the 2004 Summer Games in Athens.\n\n## Relationship with the Olympics\n\nThe Paralympic Games have a close relationship with the Olympic Games. The IPC and the IOC have a long-standing agreement that ensures the staging of the Paralympic Games is automatically included in the bid for the Olympic Games. This agreement has been extended several times, and currently, all Summer and Winter host cities announced are preparing pairs of Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\n## Paralympians at the Olympics\n\nParalympic athletes have sought equal opportunities to compete at the Olympic Games. The precedent was set by Neroli Fairhall, a Paralympic archer from New Zealand, who competed at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. In 2008, Oscar Pistorius, a South African sprinter, attempted to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Pistorius had both his legs amputated below the knee and races with two carbon fibre blades manufactured by Össur.\n\n## Funding\n\nRecent Paralympic Games have been supported by contributions from major sponsors. Unlike the Olympics, where the IOC mandates that arenas be clean of sponsor logos, the Paralympics do allow the logos of official sponsors to be displayed inside arenas and on uniforms.\n\n## Media Coverage\n\nWhile the Olympic Games have experienced tremendous growth in global media coverage since the 1984 Summer Paralympics, the Paralympics had been slower to develop a consistent mainstream media presence. However, interest in the Paralympics has been improving among broadcasters, and the IPC has secured rights deals for the 2024 Summer Paralympics covering 75% of the world.\n\n## Classification\n\nThe International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has established ten disability categories, including physical, visual, and intellectual impairment. Athletes are divided within each category according to their level of impairment, in a functional classification system which differs from sport to sport.\n\n## Sports\n\nThere are twenty-two sports on the Summer Paralympic program and six sports on the Winter Paralympics program. Within some of the sports are several events, such as alpine skiing, which has downhill, super combined, super-G, slalom, and giant slalom.\n\n## Alleged Cheating\n\nAfter the 2000 Sydney Games, a Spanish basketball player alleged that several members of the gold medal-winning Spanish basketball team with intellectual disabilities (ID) did not have disabilities. A controversy ensued, and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) called on the Spanish National Paralympic Committee to launch an investigation.\n\n## Notable Champions and Achievements\n\nTrischa Zorn of the United States is the most decorated paralympian in history, with a total of 55 medals, 41 of which are gold. Ragnhild Myklebust of Norway holds the record for the most medals ever won at the Winter Paralympic Games, with a total of 22 medals, of which 17 were gold.\n\n## Host Cities\n\nThe Paralympic Games have been held in several host cities around the world, including Rome, Italy (1960), Tokyo, Japan (1964), Tel Aviv, Israel (1968), and Beijing, China (2008). The 2020 Summer Paralympics were held in Tokyo, Japan, from 24 August to 5 September 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe article is approximately 4096 words in length and covers various aspects of the Paralympic Games, including their history, milestones, and achievements.

[7]\n\n\nStoke Mandeville Games\nThe first organized athletic event for athletes with disabilities that coincided with the Olympic Games took place on the day of the opening of the 1948 Summer Olympics in London The German-Jewish doctor Ludwig Guttmann, of Stoke Mandeville Hospital, [8] who had fled Nazi Germany with the help of the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (CARA) in 1939, [9] hosted a sports competition for British World War II veteran patients with spinal cord injuries The first games were called the 1948 International Wheelchair Games, and were intended to coincide with the 1948 Olympics [10] Guttman's aim was to create an elite sports competition for people with disabilities that would be equivalent to the Olympic Games The games were held at the same location each year, and in 1952 Dutch and Israeli veterans took part alongside the British, making it the first international competition of its own kind In 1960, the 9th annual games took place outside of the UK for the first time in Rome, to coincide with the 1960 Summer Olympics which were also being held in Rome These were to be later designated the 1st Paralympic Games [11]\n\n\nMilestones\nThere have been several milestones in the Paralympic movement The first official Paralympic Games, coincident with the ninth Stoke Mandeville Games but no longer open solely to war veterans, was held in Rome in 1960 [15] They were the brainchild of Antonio Maglio, a friend and follower of Guttmann and were financed almost entirely by Maglio's employer, the Workers National Accident Insurance Fund of Italy, then led by Renato Morelli, who was also Chairman of the International Social Security Association [16] Four hundred athletes from 23 countries competed at the 1960 Games Since 1960, the Paralympic Games have taken place in the same year as the Olympic Games [17] [18] The Games were initially open only to athletes in wheelchairs; at the 1976 Summer Games, athletes with different disabilities were included for the first time at a Summer Paralympics [10] With the inclusion of more disability classifications the 1976 Summer Games expanded to 1,600 athletes from 40 countries [17]\n\n\nWinter Games\nThe first Winter Paralympic Games were held in 1976 in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden This was the first Paralympics in which multiple categories of athletes with disabilities could compete [17] The Winter Games were celebrated every four years on the same year as their summer counterpart, just as the Olympics were This tradition was upheld through the 1992 Games in Albertville, France; after that, beginning with the 1994 Games, the Winter Paralympics and the Winter Olympics have been held in those even-numbered years separate from the Summer Olympics The winter games happen two years after the summer games [17]\n\n\nInternational Paralympic Committee\nThe International Paralympic Committee is the global governing body of the Paralympic Movement It comprises 178 [22] National Paralympic Committees (NPC) and four disability-specific international sports federations [23] The president of the IPC is Andrew Parsons The IPC's international headquarters are in Bonn, Germany [24] The IPC is responsible for organizing the Summer and Winter Paralympic Games It also serves as the International Federation for nine sports (Paralympic athletics, Paralympic swimming, Paralympic archery, Paralympic powerlifting, Para-alpine skiing, Paralympic biathlon, Paralympic cross-country skiing, ice sledge hockey and Wheelchair DanceSport) This requires the IPC to supervise and coordinate the World Championships and other competitions for each of the nine sports it regulates [25]\n\n\nName and symbols\nAlthough the name was originally coined as a portmanteau combining paraplegic (due to its origins as games for people with spinal injuries) and Olympic, [30] the inclusion of other disability groups meant that this was no longer considered very accurate The present formal explanation for the name is that it derives from the Greek preposition παρά, pará ('beside' or 'alongside') and thus refers to a competition held in parallel with the Olympic Games [31] The Summer Games of 1988 held in Seoul was the first time the term Paralympic came into official use.\n\n\nCeremonies\nAs mandated by the Paralympic Charter, various elements frame the opening ceremonies of the Paralympic Games Most of these rituals were established are the same that 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp and were shared with the Olympic Games [35] The Opening ceremony typically starts with

takes place after all sporting events have concluded Flag-bearers from each participating country enter, followed by the athletes who enter together, without any national distinction.\nThe Paralympic flag is taken down Since the 1988 Winter Paralympics, with some exceptions, the national flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Paralympic Games is hoisted while the corresponding national anthem is played The games are officially closed, and the Paralympic flame is extinguished [37] After these compulsory elements, the next host nation briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theater representative of its culture.\n\n\nMedal presentation\nA medals ceremony is held after the conclusion of each Paralympic event The winner, second and third-place competitors or teams stand on top of a three-tiered rostrum when they are awarded their respective medal by an IPC member The national flags of the medalists are then raised while the national anthem of the gold medalist is played [38] Volunteering citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies, as they aid the officials who present the medals and act as flag-bearers [39] For every Paralympic event, the respective medal ceremony is held, at most, one day after the event's final.\n\n\nEquality\nIn June 2001, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) signed an agreement that would ensure that the staging of the Paralympic Games is automatically included in the bid for the Olympic Games [40] The agreement

Summer Olympics in Los Angeles [50]\nIn 2008, Oscar Pistorius, a South African sprinter, attempted to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics Pistorius had both his legs amputated below the knee and races with two carbon fibre blades manufactured by Össur He holds the Paralympic world record in the 400 meter event [51] Pistorius missed qualifying for the 2008 Summer Olympics in the 400 meter race, by 0.70 seconds He qualified for the 2008 Summer Paralympics where he won gold medals in the 100, 200, and 400 meter sprints [52]\n\n\nFunding\nStarting at the 1992 Summer Paralympics, recent

the Paralympics had been slower to develop a consistent mainstream media presence In June 2023, IPC executives noted that interest in the Paralympics had been improving among broadcasters, citing that that it had already reached rights deals for the 2024 Summer Paralympics covering 75% of the world over a year in advance (in comparison to 2020, where many deals were made \"last minute\"), and that it had been pushing for broader coverage and increased rights fees since broadcasters were starting to \" [realize] that  [the Paralympics are] actually a great sporting event\", and not treat them as a low-effort obligation bundled with their Olympics rights Unlike the Olympics, the IPC holds the digital rights to the Paralympics in some markets, allowing it to promote live coverage and other highlights via its own social media platforms to engage online audiences [57]\n\n\nOutside the Games\nA 2010 study by the University of British Columbia (UBC) on the Olympic Games Impact (OGI), showed that of roughly 1,600 Canadian respondents, 41 to 50 percent believed the 2010 Paralympic and Olympic Games in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, triggered additional accessibility of buildings, sidewalks and public spaces 23 percent of employers said the Games had increased their willingness to hire people with disabilities [68]\n\n\nDown syndrome participation\nWithin the framework of the International Olympic Committee's commitment to equal access to athletics, concerns have been raised regarding inclusion of athletes with Down syndrome in the Paralympic Games While the Paralympic movement strives for inclusivity, the absence of a specific classification for athletes with Down syndrome within Paralympic swimming events raises questions about equal and fair competition for Down syndrome athletes.\n\n\nClassification\nThe International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has established ten disability categories Athletes are divided within each category according to their level of impairment, in a functional classification system which differs from sport to sport.\n\n\nCategories\nThe IPC has established ten disability categories, including physical, visual, and intellectual impairment Athletes with one of these disabilities can compete in the Paralympics, though not every sport can allow for every disability category These categories apply to both Summer and Winter Paralympics [77]\n\n\nClassification system\nWithin the disability categories, athletes are further divided into Sport Classes according to the degree of activity limitation resulting from their impairments; this aims to minimise the impact of an athlete's impairment on their sporting performance against their rivals Sport Classes are numbered, with a lower number signifying a greater level of impairment: for example, in Paralympic swimming athletes with visual impairments compete in three Sport Classes from S/SB11 to S/SB13, with S/SB11 athletes having a very low light acuity and/or no light perception, and S/SB13 athletes having the least severe visual impairment eligible for Paralympic sport [79]\n\n\nMedical classification (until the 1980s)\nFrom its inception until the 1980s, the Paralympic system for classifying athletes consisted of a medical evaluation and diagnosis of impairment An athlete's medical condition was the only factor used to determine what class they competed in For example, an athlete who had a spinal cord injury that resulted in lower limb paresis, would not compete in the same wheelchair race as an athlete with a double above-knee amputation The fact that their disability caused the same impairment did not factor into classification determination, the only consideration was their medical diagnosis It was not until views on disabled athletics shifted from just a form of rehabilitation to an end in itself, that the classification system changed from medical diagnosis to a focus on the functional abilities of the athlete [80]\n\n\nFunctional classification (since the 1980s)\nWhile there is no clear date when the shift occurred, a functional classification system became the norm for disabled athletic classification in the 1980s In a functional system, the focus is on what effect the athlete's impairment has on his or her athletic performance Under this system, athletes with total loss of function in their legs will compete together in most sports, because their functional loss is the same and the reason for the loss is immaterial The only exception to the functional system is the classification format used by International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA), which still uses a medically based system [80]\n\n\nSports\nThere are twenty-two sports on the Summer Paralympic program and six sports on the Winter Paralympics program Within some of the sports are several events For example, alpine skiing has downhill, super combined, super-G, slalom, giant slalom The IPC has governance over several of the sports but not all of them Other international organizations, known as International Sports Federations (IF), notably the International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation (IWAS), the International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA), and the Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA), govern some sports that are specific to certain disability groups [84] There are national chapters for these International Sport Federations including National Paralympic Committees, which are responsible for recruitment of athletes and governance of sports at the national level [85]\n\n\nAlleged cheating\nAfter the 2000 Sydney games, a Spanish basketball player alleged that several members of the gold medal-winning Spanish basketball team with intellectual disabilities (ID) did not have disabilities He claimed that only two athletes out of the twelve-member team met the qualifications of an athlete with an intellectual disability [86] A controversy ensued and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) called on the Spanish National Paralympic Committee to launch an investigation [87] The investigation uncovered several Spanish athletes who had

Born on 29 March 1980 in Amman, Jordan, Hamzah is a grandson of King Hussein and the half-brother of King Abdullah II.\n\n**Biography**\n\nPrince Hamzah was born on 29 March 1980 at King Hussein Medical Center in Wadi Al-Seer, Amman. His parents were King Hussein and his second wife, Princess Muna Al-Hussein. Hamzah's ancestry can be traced back to the Islamic prophet Muhammad through the Hashemite family, a noble line of Arab leaders. His parents named him after Hamza ibn Abd al-Muttalib, a cousin of the prophet Muhammad and a prominent figure in Islamic history.\n\nGrowing up, Hamzah was educated at home and later attended school in Jordan. He has two sisters, Princess Iman and Princess Raiyah, and a half-brother, Prince Ali, who is the twin brother of King Abdullah II. Hamzah's family has a long history of involvement in Jordanian politics, and he has been groomed to play a significant role in the country's future.\n\n**Succession Issue**\n\nOn 7 February 1999, King Hussein died, and his eldest son, Prince Abdullah bin Al Hussein, ascended to the throne. However, in a surprise move, King Abdullah II designated his half-brother, Hamzah, as his heir apparent on the same day. This decision was made in compliance with King Hussein's wish, as stated in his will. As a result, Hamzah was accorded the title of crown prince and became the next in line to the throne.\n\nHowever, this decision was short-lived, as King Abdullah II later changed his mind and designated his own son, Crown Prince Hussein, as his heir apparent. This move was seen as a significant blow to Hamzah's prospects of becoming king.\n\n**House Arrest**\n\nOn 3 April 2021, a video emerged showing Prince Hamzah in which he reported that he had been placed under house arrest as part of a crackdown on critics of the government. The video was passed to the BBC through Hamzah's lawyer, and it sparked widespread outrage and concern about the state of human rights in Jordan.\n\nThe crisis began when Jordan's military chief of staff, General Younes, visited Hamzah and warned him to stop attending meetings with critics of the government. Hamzah reportedly refused to comply, and as a result, he was placed under house arrest.\n\nKing Abdullah II publicly hinted that the tension with Hamzah was ending, stating that Hamzah was now \"in his palace under my protection.\" However, the move was seen as a significant blow to Hamzah's reputation and a sign of the king's growing authoritarianism.\n\n**Marriages and Family**\n\nPrince Hamzah married his second cousin, Princess Noor bint Asem bin Nayef, at Al-Baraka Palace in Amman on 29 August 2003. The official wedding was held on 27 May 2004 at Zahran Palace. However, the couple divorced on 9 September 2009.\n\nHamzah has two sons, Hussein and Hasan, from his second marriage to Sarvath al-Hassan. He also has a daughter, Fatima, from his first marriage to Princess Noor.\n\n**Honours**\n\nPrince Hamzah has received numerous honors and awards for his contributions to Jordanian society. He has been decorated by the Jordanian government for his service to the country and has received awards from international organizations for his philanthropic work.\n\n**References**\n\n* Queen Noor (2003).

Her parents, who are of Chinese and Irish descent, encouraged her interest in the arts from an early age. Cathcart's sister, who is five years older than her, began acting before she did and gained a talent agent at the age of six or seven. This led to appearances in a few commercials, which likely inspired Cathcart to follow in her sister's footsteps.\n\nAt the age of eight, Cathcart appeared in a Crayola and Campbell's Soup commercial, marking her early foray into the world of acting. Despite her early start, Cathcart stated that she has \"never really been to acting classes,\" instead drawing inspiration from performances on Disney Channel and Netflix.\n\n**Career**\n\nCathcart's early work began with appearances in commercials, which eventually led to her first major role in the Disney Channel series \"Odd Squad.\" The show, which premiered in 2014, follows the adventures of a group of young agents who work for a secret organization that protects the world from strange and supernatural threats.

Despite these challenges, she has persevered and continued to work towards her goals.\n\nIn addition to her acting career, Cathcart is also passionate about her health and wellness.

the third chronicles the threat of the impending winter, as well as the legendary creatures and fierce peoples of the North [8]\n\n\nCast and characters\nGame of Thrones has an ensemble cast which has been estimated to be the largest on television [9] In 2014, several actors' contracts were renegotiated to include a seventh-season option [10] By the final season, five of the main cast members made $1 million per episode, making them among the highest paid television performers [11] [12]\n\n\nThemes\nBoth television critics and historians have praised the series for what was perceived as a sort of medieval realism [15] [16] [17] George R R Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre [18] [19] [20] Martin said, \"The true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves\" [21] Academics have classified the series as neo-medieval, which focuses on overlapping medieval history and popular fantasy [22] [23] [24] A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world [25] In the series, political leaders have mostly been portrayed negatively, as they usually disregard the well-being of the common people and are guided in their decisions by selfish reasons Few possible exceptions include Daenerys Targaryen, Jon Snow and Tyrion Lannister, who have shown concern about the populace Still, their methods or commitment to the cause have been criticized [26] Martin explores the relationship between good and evil through the questions of redemption and character change [27] Unlike in many other fantasies, the series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective [20] [28]\n\n\nInspirations and derivations\nAlthough the series's first season closely follows the events of the first novel, there were significant changes made for later seasons According to Benioff, the TV adaptation is \"about adapting the series as a whole and following the map George laid out for us and hitting the major milestones, but not necessarily each of the stops along the way\" [33] Aspects of the novels' plots and their adaptations are based upon settings, characters, and events in European history [34] Most of Westeros is reminiscent of high medieval Europe, from its geography and castles to its cultures, the feudal system, palace intrigues, and the knights' tournaments [35] [36] Like medieval Europe, most of the houses in the series use the patriarchal system of power [37] The series also includes elements of gothic fiction, including torture tropes [38]\n\n\nEpisodes\nThe A Song of Ice and Fire series of novels was popular before Game of Thrones [49] The series has sold more than 90 million copies worldwide with the novels being translated into 45 different languages [50] [51] George R R Martin received multiple fantasy writing awards and nominations, including a World Fantasy Award and multiple Locus Awards, for the series [52] Writing for Time magazine in 2005 after the release of A Feast for Crows, journalist Lev Grossman called Martin the \"American Tolkien\", stating he is a \"major force for evolution in fantasy\" [53]\n\n\nProduction\nThe A Song of Ice and Fire series of novels was popular before Game of Thrones [49] The series has sold more than 90 million copies worldwide with the novels being translated into 45 different languages [50] [51] George R R Martin received multiple fantasy writing awards and nominations, including a World Fantasy Award and multiple Locus Awards, for the series [52] Writing for Time magazine in 2005 after the release of A Feast for Crows, journalist Lev Grossman called Martin the \"American Tolkien\", stating he is a \"major force for evolution in fantasy\" [53]\n\n\nConception and development\nThe A Song of Ice and Fire series of novels was popular before Game of Thrones [49] The series has sold more than 90 million copies worldwide with the novels being translated into 45 different languages [50] [51] George R R Martin received multiple fantasy writing awards and nominations, including a World Fantasy Award and multiple Locus Awards, for the series [52] Writing for Time magazine in 2005 after the release of A Feast for Crows, journalist Lev Grossman called Martin the \"American Tolkien\", stating he is a \"major force for evolution in fantasy\" [53]\n\n\nCasting\nNina Gold and Robert Sterne were the series' primary casting directors [73] Through a process of auditions and readings, the main cast was assembled The only exceptions were Peter Dinklage and Sean Bean, whom the writers wanted from the start; they were announced as joining the pilot in 2009 [74] [75] Other actors signed for the pilot were Kit Harington as Jon Snow, Jack Gleeson as Joffrey Baratheon, Harry Lloyd as Viserys Targaryen, and Mark Addy as Robert Baratheon [75] According to Benioff and Weiss, Addy was the easiest actor to cast for the series because of his audition performance [76] Some characters in the pilot were recast for the first season The role of Catelyn Stark was played initially by Jennifer Ehle, but the role was recast with Michelle Fairley [77] The character of Daenerys Targaryen was also recast, with Emilia Clarke replacing Tamzin Merchant [78] The rest of the first season's cast was selected in the second half of 2009 [79]\n\n\nWriting\nGame of Thrones used seven writers over its six seasons Benioff and Weiss wrote most of each season's episodes [81] A Song of Ice and Fire author George R R Martin wrote one episode in each of the first four seasons Martin did not write an episode for the later seasons, since he wanted to focus on completing the sixth novel (The Winds of Winter) [82] Jane Espenson co-wrote one first-season episode as a freelance writer [83]\n\n\nAdaptation schedule and episodes\nAfter Game of Thrones's story line began outpacing the published novels in the sixth season, the series was based on a plot outline of the future novels provided by Martin along with original content [85] [86] Before season four, Martin stated there was an issue with the television series being released before the source material could be written [87] According to Benioff, Martin gave the showrunners an outline on the final two books of the series [88] In April 2016, the showrunners' plan was to shoot 13 more episodes after the sixth season: seven episodes in the seventh season and six episodes in the eighth [89] Later that month, the series was renewed for a seventh season with a seven-episode order [90] [91] HBO announced in June 2016 that the eighth season would be the final for the series [92]\n\n\nFilming\nThe show was shot in the United Kingdom, Canada, Croatia, Iceland, Malta, Morocco, and Spain.\n\n\nEffect on locations\nNorthern Ireland Screen, a UK government agency financed by Invest NI and the European Regional Development Fund, helped fund Game of Thrones [126] Tourism Ireland has a Game of Thrones-themed marketing campaign similar to New Zealand's Tolkien-related advertising [127] [128] According to First Minister Arlene Foster, the series has given Northern Ireland the most publicity in its history apart from The Troubles [129] The production of Game of Thrones and other TV series boosted Northern Ireland's creative industries, contributing to an estimated 12.4 percent growth in arts, entertainment and recreation jobs between 2008 and 2013 (compared with 4.3 percent in the rest of the UK during the same period) [130] After filming had finished, HBO converted its filming locations in Northern Ireland into tourist attractions to be opened in 2019 [131] By 2019, 350,000 visitors, or one sixth of all tourists, came to Northern Ireland annually because of Game of Thrones [132]\n\n\nDirecting\nEach ten-episode season of Game of Thrones had four to six directors, who usually directed back-to-back episodes [142] Alan Taylor directed seven episodes, the most of any director [143] Alex Graves, David Nutter, Mark Mylod, and Jeremy Podeswa directed six episodes each [144] Daniel Minahan directed five episodes, and Michelle MacLaren, Alik Sakharov, and Miguel Sapochnik directed four each; MacLaren is the only female director of the entire series's run [145] Brian Kirk directed three episodes during the first season, and Tim Van Patten directed the series's first two episodes [146] Neil Marshall directed two episodes, both with large battle scenes: \"Blackwater\" and \"The Watchers on the Wall\" [147] Other directors include Jack Bender, David Petrarca, Daniel Sackheim, Michael Slovis and Matt Shakman [148] David Benioff and D B Weiss have directed two episodes together but were credited with only one each, which was determined after a coin toss [84] For season eight, David Nutter and Miguel Sapochnik, who worked on previous episodes, directed the first five episodes [149] Benioff and Weiss were credited as both the writers and directors of the show finale \"The Iron Throne\" [150]\n\n\nProduction design\nMichele Clapton was the costume designer for Game of Thrones' first five seasons before she was replaced by April Ferry [151] Clapton returned to the series as its costume designer for the seventh season [152] For the first three seasons, Paul Engelen was Game of Thrones' main makeup designer and prosthetic makeup artist with Melissa Lackersteen, Conor O'Sullivan, and Rob Trenton At the beginning of the fourth season, Engelen's team was replaced by Jane Walker and her crew, composed of Ann McEwan and Barrie and Sarah Gower [153] [154] Over 130 makeup artists and prosthetic designers worked on the show [155] [156]\n\n\nVisual effects\nFor the large number of visual effects used in the series, HBO hired British-based BlueBolt and Irish-based Screen Scene for season one Most of the environment builds were done as 2.5D projections, giving viewers perspective while keeping the programming from being overwhelming [161] In 2011, the season one finale, \"Fire and Blood\", was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects [153] The visual effects crew consisted of both on-set VFX supervisors and concept artists along with visual effect editors in post-production [162]\n\n\nTitle sequence\nThe series's title sequence was created for HBO by production studio Elastic [173] Creative director Angus Wall and his collaborators received the 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Main Title Design for the sequence, [174] which depicts a three-dimensional map of the series's fictional world The map is projected on the inside of a sphere which is centrally lit by a small sun in an armillary sphere [175] As the camera moves across the map, focusing on the locations of the episode's events, clockwork mechanisms intertwine and allow buildings and other structures to emerge from the map Accompanied by the title music, the names of the principal cast and creative staff appear The sequence concludes after about 90 seconds with the title card and brief opening credits detailing the episode's writer(s) and director Its composition changes as the story progresses, with new locations replacing those featuring less prominently or not at all [175] [176] Entertainment Weekly named the title sequence one of the best on television, calling it an \"all-inclusive cruise of Westeros\" [177]\n\n\nMusic\nRamin Djawadi composed the series's music The first season's soundtrack, written about ten weeks before the series's premiere, [178] was published by Varèse Sarabande in June 2011 [179] Soundtrack albums for subsequent seasons have been released, with tracks by the National, the Hold Steady and Sigur Rós [180] Djawadi composed reoccurring themes for each of the major houses and some main characters [181] Some themes evolved over time Daenerys Targaryen's theme was simple and became more complex after each season At first, her theme was played by a single instrument, a cello, and Djawadi later incorporated more instruments into it [181] Djawadi was nominated twice for a Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media for his work on the show [182] In addition to the originally scored music, Columbia Records released the For the Throne: Music Inspired by the HBO Series Game of Thrones companion album on April 26, 2019 [183]\n\n\nLanguage\nThe Westerosi characters of Game of Thrones speak British-accented English, often (but not consistently) with the accent of the English region corresponding to the character's Westerosi region [184] The Northerner Eddard Stark speaks in actor Sean Bean's native northern accent, and the southern lord Tywin Lannister speaks with a southern accent, while characters from Dorne speak English with a Spanish accent [185] [186] Characters foreign to Westeros often have a non-British accent [187]\n\n\nAvailability\nGame of Thrones was broadcast by HBO in the United States and by its local subsidiaries or other pay television services in other countries, at the same time as in the US or weeks (or months) later Broadcasters carrying Game of Thrones included Fox Showcase in Australia;

and that omitting them from the narrative would have rung false and undermined one of his novels' themes, its historical realism [305] HBO said that they \"fully support the vision and artistry of Dan and David's exceptional work and we feel this work speaks for itself\" [21] The show has reportedly been censored or banned for sexual or violent content in countries like China, [306] [307] India, [308] [309] Iran, [310] Jordan, [311] Singapore, [312] Turkey, [313] [314] United Arab Emirates, [315] and Vietnam [316]\n\n\nLighting\nThe lighting, or lack of light, in darker scenes has been a recurring point of criticism since season six of the series [336] [337] [338] [339] In 2016, Bustle's Caitlyn Callegari listed 31 examples of scenes where the lighting caused viewers problems ranging from not being able to tell a character's hair color to being unable to see what was going on [340] Some reviewers have noted this is part of a wider trend [341] among shows that are made by people who have experience working primarily on films, suggesting they \"haven't grasped the nuances (or lack thereof)\" of television as a medium, especially the differences between watching a scene on a television screen versus watching it on the big screen in a movie theater [342]\n\n\nCultural influence\nAlthough Game of Thrones was initially dismissed by some critics, [15] its success has been credited with an increase in the fantasy genre's popularity [348] The series's popularity led to increased sales of the A Song of Ice and Fire novels (republished in tie-in editions), which remained at the top of bestseller lists for months [349] [350] On the eve of the second season's premiere, CNN said, \"after this weekend, you may be hard pressed to find someone who isn't a fan of some form of epic fantasy\" and cited Ian Bogost as saying that the series continues a trend of successful screen adaptations beginning with Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy (2001–2003) and the Harry Potter films (2001–2011) establishing fantasy as a mass-market genre; they are \"gateway drugs to fantasy fan culture\" [351] The show's success led to the commissioning of several fantasy television series, including The Wheel of Time and The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power by Amazon Studios [352] According to Neil Gaiman, whose novels Good Omens and American Gods were adapted for television, Game of Thrones helped to change attitudes towards fantasy on television, but mainly it made big budgets for fantasy series more acceptable [353]\n\n\nFandom\nA Song of Ice and Fire and Game of Thrones have a broad, active international fan base In 2012 Vulture ranked the series's fans as the most devoted in popular culture, more so than those of Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, Harry Potter or Star Wars [375] Fans include political leaders such as former US president Barack Obama, [376] [377] former British prime minister David Cameron, [378] former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard [379] and Dutch foreign minister Frans Timmermans, who framed European politics using quotes from Martin's novels in a 2013 speech [380]\n\n\nAwards\nGame of Thrones has won numerous awards throughout its run, including 59 Emmy Awards, eight Screen Actors Guild Awards and a Peabody Award It holds the record for total Emmy Award wins for a scripted television series (surpassing the record of 37 wins held by Frasier since 2004) and for most Emmy nominations for a drama series, with 161 [153] [387] [388] [389] In 2019, the show's final season established a new record for most Emmy nominations received in a year with 32, breaking the 25-year-long record of 26 nominations established by NYPD Blue in 1994 [390] In 2013, the Writers Guild of America listed Game of Thrones as the 40th best written series in television history [391] Also in 2013, at the Media Access Awards, George R R Martin accepted the Visionary Award from the Writers With Disabilities committee of the Writers Guild of America, for its positive portrayal of character with disabilities [392] In 2015, The Hollywood Reporter placed it at number four on their best TV shows ever list, [393] while in 2016 the series was placed seventh on Empire's \"The 50 best TV shows ever\" [394] The same year, Rolling Stone named it the twelfth \"greatest TV Show of all time\" [395] In 2023, Variety ranked Game of Thrones No 21 on its list of the 100 greatest TV shows of all time [396]\n\n\nViewership\nGame of Thrones was considered a ratings success for HBO throughout all eight seasons [397] [398] The show premiere was watched by 2.2 million, and the first season averaged 2.5 million viewers per episode [399] For its second season, the series had an average gross audience of 11.6 million viewers [400] The third season was seen by 14.2 million viewers, making Game of Thrones the second-most-viewed HBO series (after The Sopranos) [401] HBO said that Game of Thrones' average gross audience of 18.4 million viewers (later adjusted to 18.6 million) had passed The Sopranos for the viewership record [402] [403] The season five episode \"The House of Black and White\" was simulcasted in 173 countries, becoming the \"largest TV drama telecast\" according to Guinness World Records [404]\n\n\nOther media\nThe series and the novels have inspired several video games [421] [422] [423]\n\n\nVideo games\nThe series and the novels have inspired several video games [421] [422] [423]\n\n\nMerchandise and exhibition\nHBO has licensed a variety of merchandise based on Game of Thrones, including games, replica weapons and armor, jewelry, bobblehead dolls by Funko, beer by Ommegang and apparel [424] High-end merchandise includes a $10,500 Ulysse Nardin wristwatch [425] and a $30,000 resin replica of the Iron Throne [426] In 2013 and 2014, a traveling exhibition of costumes, props, armor and weapons from the series visited major cities in Europe and the Americas [427] Starting 2018, Diageo released several Game of Thrones themed whiskies [428]\n\n\nRelated shows\nThronecast: The Official Guide to Game of Thrones, a series of podcasts presented by Geoff Lloyd and produced by Koink, were released on the Sky Atlantic website and the UK iTunes store during the series's run;

the third chronicles the threat of the impending winter, as well as the legendary creatures and fierce peoples of the North [8]\n\n\nCast and characters\nGame of Thrones has an ensemble cast which has been estimated to be the largest on television [9] In 2014, several actors' contracts were renegotiated to include a seventh-season option [10] By the final season, five of the main cast members made $1 million per episode, making them among the highest paid television performers [11] [12]\n\n\nThemes\nBoth television critics and historians have praised the series for what was perceived as a sort of medieval realism [15] [16] [17] George R R Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre [18] [19] [20] Martin said, \"The true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves\" [21] Academics have classified the series as neo-medieval, which focuses on overlapping medieval history and popular fantasy [22] [23] [24] A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world [25] In the series, political leaders have mostly been portrayed negatively, as they usually disregard the well-being of the common people and are guided in their decisions by selfish reasons Few possible exceptions include Daenerys Targaryen, Jon Snow and Tyrion Lannister, who have shown concern about the populace Still, their methods or commitment to the cause have been criticized [26] Martin explores the relationship between good and evil through the questions of redemption and character change [27] Unlike in many other fantasies, the series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective [20] [28]\n\n\nInspirations and derivations\nAlthough the series's first season closely follows the events of the first novel, there were significant changes made for later seasons According to Benioff, the TV adaptation is \"about adapting the series as a whole and following the map George laid out for us and hitting the major milestones, but not necessarily each of the stops along the way\" [33] Aspects of the novels' plots and their adaptations are based upon settings, characters, and events in European history [34] Most of Westeros is reminiscent of high medieval Europe, from its geography and castles to its cultures, the feudal system, palace intrigues, and the knights' tournaments [35] [36] Like medieval Europe, most of the houses in the series use the patriarchal system of power [37] The series also includes elements of gothic fiction, including torture tropes [38]\n\n\nEpisodes\nThe A Song of Ice and Fire series of novels was popular before Game of Thrones [49] The series has sold more than 90 million copies worldwide with the novels being translated into 45 different languages [50] [51] George R R Martin received multiple fantasy writing awards and nominations, including a World Fantasy Award and multiple Locus Awards, for the series [52] Writing for Time magazine in 2005 after the release of A Feast for Crows, journalist Lev Grossman called Martin the \"American Tolkien\", stating he is a \"major force for evolution in fantasy\" [53]\n\n\nProduction\nThe A Song of Ice and Fire series of novels was popular before Game of Thrones [49] The series has sold more than 90 million copies worldwide with the novels being translated into 45 different languages [50] [51] George R R Martin received multiple fantasy writing awards and nominations, including a World Fantasy Award and multiple Locus Awards, for the series [52] Writing for Time magazine in 2005 after the release of A Feast for Crows, journalist Lev Grossman called Martin the \"American Tolkien\", stating he is a \"major force for evolution in fantasy\" [53]\n\n\nConception and development\nThe A Song of Ice and Fire series of novels was popular before Game of Thrones [49] The series has sold more than 90 million copies worldwide with the novels being translated into 45 different languages [50] [51] George R R Martin received multiple fantasy writing awards and nominations, including a World Fantasy Award and multiple Locus Awards, for the series [52] Writing for Time magazine in 2005 after the release of A Feast for Crows, journalist Lev Grossman called Martin the \"American Tolkien\", stating he is a \"major force for evolution in fantasy\" [53]\n\n\nCasting\nNina Gold and Robert Sterne were the series' primary casting directors [73] Through a process of auditions and readings, the main cast was assembled The only exceptions were Peter Dinklage and Sean Bean, whom the writers wanted from the start; they were announced as joining the pilot in 2009 [74] [75] Other actors signed for the pilot were Kit Harington as Jon Snow, Jack Gleeson as Joffrey Baratheon, Harry Lloyd as Viserys Targaryen, and Mark Addy as Robert Baratheon [75] According to Benioff and Weiss, Addy was the easiest actor to cast for the series because of his audition performance [76] Some characters in the pilot were recast for the first season The role of Catelyn Stark was played initially by Jennifer Ehle, but the role was recast with Michelle Fairley [77] The character of Daenerys Targaryen was also recast, with Emilia Clarke replacing Tamzin Merchant [78] The rest of the first season's cast was selected in the second half of 2009 [79]\n\n\nWriting\nGame of Thrones used seven writers over its six seasons Benioff and Weiss wrote most of each season's episodes [81] A Song of Ice and Fire author George R R Martin wrote one episode in each of the first four seasons Martin did not write an episode for the later seasons, since he wanted to focus on completing the sixth novel (The Winds of Winter) [82] Jane Espenson co-wrote one first-season episode as a freelance writer [83]\n\n\nAdaptation schedule and episodes\nAfter Game of Thrones's story line began outpacing the published novels in the sixth season, the series was based on a plot outline of the future novels provided by Martin along with original content [85] [86] Before season four, Martin stated there was an issue with the television series being released before the source material could be written [87] According to Benioff, Martin gave the showrunners an outline on the final two books of the series [88] In April 2016, the showrunners' plan was to shoot 13 more episodes after the sixth season: seven episodes in the seventh season and six episodes in the eighth [89] Later that month, the series was renewed for a seventh season with a seven-episode order [90] [91] HBO announced in June 2016 that the eighth season would be the final for the series [92]\n\n\nFilming\nThe show was shot in the United Kingdom, Canada, Croatia, Iceland, Malta, Morocco, and Spain.\n\n\nEffect on locations\nNorthern Ireland Screen, a UK government agency financed by Invest NI and the European Regional Development Fund, helped fund Game of Thrones [126] Tourism Ireland has a Game of Thrones-themed marketing campaign similar to New Zealand's Tolkien-related advertising [127] [128] According to First Minister Arlene Foster, the series has given Northern Ireland the most publicity in its history apart from The Troubles [129] The production of Game of Thrones and other TV series boosted Northern Ireland's creative industries, contributing to an estimated 12.4 percent growth in arts, entertainment and recreation jobs between 2008 and 2013 (compared with 4.3 percent in the rest of the UK during the same period) [130] After filming had finished, HBO converted its filming locations in Northern Ireland into tourist attractions to be opened in 2019 [131] By 2019, 350,000 visitors, or one sixth of all tourists, came to Northern Ireland annually because of Game of Thrones [132]\n\n\nDirecting\nEach ten-episode season of Game of Thrones had four to six directors, who usually directed back-to-back episodes [142] Alan Taylor directed seven episodes, the most of any director [143] Alex Graves, David Nutter, Mark Mylod, and Jeremy Podeswa directed six episodes each [144] Daniel Minahan directed five episodes, and Michelle MacLaren, Alik Sakharov, and Miguel Sapochnik directed four each; MacLaren is the only female director of the entire series's run [145] Brian Kirk directed three episodes during the first season, and Tim Van Patten directed the series's first two episodes [146] Neil Marshall directed two episodes, both with large battle scenes: \"Blackwater\" and \"The Watchers on the Wall\" [147] Other directors include Jack Bender, David Petrarca, Daniel Sackheim, Michael Slovis and Matt Shakman [148] David Benioff and D B Weiss have directed two episodes together but were credited with only one each, which was determined after a coin toss [84] For season eight, David Nutter and Miguel Sapochnik, who worked on previous episodes, directed the first five episodes [149] Benioff and Weiss were credited as both the writers and directors of the show finale \"The Iron Throne\" [150]\n\n\nProduction design\nMichele Clapton was the costume designer for Game of Thrones' first five seasons before she was replaced by April Ferry [151] Clapton returned to the series as its costume designer for the seventh season [152] For the first three seasons, Paul Engelen was Game of Thrones' main makeup designer and prosthetic makeup artist with Melissa Lackersteen, Conor O'Sullivan, and Rob Trenton At the beginning of the fourth season, Engelen's team was replaced by Jane Walker and her crew, composed of Ann McEwan and Barrie and Sarah Gower [153] [154] Over 130 makeup artists and prosthetic designers worked on the show [155] [156]\n\n\nVisual effects\nFor the large number of visual effects used in the series, HBO hired British-based BlueBolt and Irish-based Screen Scene for season one Most of the environment builds were done as 2.5D projections, giving viewers perspective while keeping the programming from being overwhelming [161] In 2011, the season one finale, \"Fire and Blood\", was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects [153] The visual effects crew consisted of both on-set VFX supervisors and concept artists along with visual effect editors in post-production [162]\n\n\nTitle sequence\nThe series's title sequence was created for HBO by production studio Elastic [173] Creative director Angus Wall and his collaborators received the 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Main Title Design for the sequence, [174] which depicts a three-dimensional map of the series's fictional world The map is projected on the inside of a sphere which is centrally lit by a small sun in an armillary sphere [175] As the camera moves across the map, focusing on the locations of the episode's events, clockwork mechanisms intertwine and allow buildings and other structures to emerge from the map Accompanied by the title music, the names of the principal cast and creative staff appear The sequence concludes after about 90 seconds with the title card and brief opening credits detailing the episode's writer(s) and director Its composition changes as the story progresses, with new locations replacing those featuring less prominently or not at all [175] [176] Entertainment Weekly named the title sequence one of the best on television, calling it an \"all-inclusive cruise of Westeros\" [177]\n\n\nMusic\nRamin Djawadi composed the series's music The first season's soundtrack, written about ten weeks before the series's premiere, [178] was published by Varèse Sarabande in June 2011 [179] Soundtrack albums for subsequent seasons have been released, with tracks by the National, the Hold Steady and Sigur Rós [180] Djawadi composed reoccurring themes for each of the major houses and some main characters [181] Some themes evolved over time Daenerys Targaryen's theme was simple and became more complex after each season At first, her theme was played by a single instrument, a cello, and Djawadi later incorporated more instruments into it [181] Djawadi was nominated twice for a Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media for his work on the show [182] In addition to the originally scored music, Columbia Records released the For the Throne: Music Inspired by the HBO Series Game of Thrones companion album on April 26, 2019 [183]\n\n\nLanguage\nThe Westerosi characters of Game of Thrones speak British-accented English, often (but not consistently) with the accent of the English region corresponding to the character's Westerosi region [184] The Northerner Eddard Stark speaks in actor Sean Bean's native northern accent, and the southern lord Tywin Lannister speaks with a southern accent, while characters from Dorne speak English with a Spanish accent [185] [186] Characters foreign to Westeros often have a non-British accent [187]\n\n\nAvailability\nGame of Thrones was broadcast by HBO in the United States and by its local subsidiaries or other pay television services in other countries, at the same time as in the US or weeks (or months) later Broadcasters carrying Game of Thrones included Fox Showcase in Australia;

and that omitting them from the narrative would have rung false and undermined one of his novels' themes, its historical realism [305] HBO said that they \"fully support the vision and artistry of Dan and David's exceptional work and we feel this work speaks for itself\" [21] The show has reportedly been censored or banned for sexual or violent content in countries like China, [306] [307] India, [308] [309] Iran, [310] Jordan, [311] Singapore, [312] Turkey, [313] [314] United Arab Emirates, [315] and Vietnam [316]\n\n\nLighting\nThe lighting, or lack of light, in darker scenes has been a recurring point of criticism since season six of the series [336] [337] [338] [339] In 2016, Bustle's Caitlyn Callegari listed 31 examples of scenes where the lighting caused viewers problems ranging from not being able to tell a character's hair color to being unable to see what was going on [340] Some reviewers have noted this is part of a wider trend [341] among shows that are made by people who have experience working primarily on films, suggesting they \"haven't grasped the nuances (or lack thereof)\" of television as a medium, especially the differences between watching a scene on a television screen versus watching it on the big screen in a movie theater [342]\n\n\nCultural influence\nAlthough Game of Thrones was initially dismissed by some critics, [15] its success has been credited with an increase in the fantasy genre's popularity [348] The series's popularity led to increased sales of the A Song of Ice and Fire novels (republished in tie-in editions), which remained at the top of bestseller lists for months [349] [350] On the eve of the second season's premiere, CNN said, \"after this weekend, you may be hard pressed to find someone who isn't a fan of some form of epic fantasy\" and cited Ian Bogost as saying that the series continues a trend of successful screen adaptations beginning with Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy (2001–2003) and the Harry Potter films (2001–2011) establishing fantasy as a mass-market genre; they are \"gateway drugs to fantasy fan culture\" [351] The show's success led to the commissioning of several fantasy television series, including The Wheel of Time and The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power by Amazon Studios [352] According to Neil Gaiman, whose novels Good Omens and American Gods were adapted for television, Game of Thrones helped to change attitudes towards fantasy on television, but mainly it made big budgets for fantasy series more acceptable [353]\n\n\nFandom\nA Song of Ice and Fire and Game of Thrones have a broad, active international fan base In 2012 Vulture ranked the series's fans as the most devoted in popular culture, more so than those of Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, Harry Potter or Star Wars [375] Fans include political leaders such as former US president Barack Obama, [376] [377] former British prime minister David Cameron, [378] former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard [379] and Dutch foreign minister Frans Timmermans, who framed European politics using quotes from Martin's novels in a 2013 speech [380]\n\n\nAwards\nGame of Thrones has won numerous awards throughout its run, including 59 Emmy Awards, eight Screen Actors Guild Awards and a Peabody Award It holds the record for total Emmy Award wins for a scripted television series (surpassing the record of 37 wins held by Frasier since 2004) and for most Emmy nominations for a drama series, with 161 [153] [387] [388] [389] In 2019, the show's final season established a new record for most Emmy nominations received in a year with 32, breaking the 25-year-long record of 26 nominations established by NYPD Blue in 1994 [390] In 2013, the Writers Guild of America listed Game of Thrones as the 40th best written series in television history [391] Also in 2013, at the Media Access Awards, George R R Martin accepted the Visionary Award from the Writers With Disabilities committee of the Writers Guild of America, for its positive portrayal of character with disabilities [392] In 2015, The Hollywood Reporter placed it at number four on their best TV shows ever list, [393] while in 2016 the series was placed seventh on Empire's \"The 50 best TV shows ever\" [394] The same year, Rolling Stone named it the twelfth \"greatest TV Show of all time\" [395] In 2023, Variety ranked Game of Thrones No 21 on its list of the 100 greatest TV shows of all time [396]\n\n\nViewership\nGame of Thrones was considered a ratings success for HBO throughout all eight seasons [397] [398] The show premiere was watched by 2.2 million, and the first season averaged 2.5 million viewers per episode [399] For its second season, the series had an average gross audience of 11.6 million viewers [400] The third season was seen by 14.2 million viewers, making Game of Thrones the second-most-viewed HBO series (after The Sopranos) [401] HBO said that Game of Thrones' average gross audience of 18.4 million viewers (later adjusted to 18.6 million) had passed The Sopranos for the viewership record [402] [403] The season five episode \"The House of Black and White\" was simulcasted in 173 countries, becoming the \"largest TV drama telecast\" according to Guinness World Records [404]\n\n\nOther media\nThe series and the novels have inspired several video games [421] [422] [423]\n\n\nVideo games\nThe series and the novels have inspired several video games [421] [422] [423]\n\n\nMerchandise and exhibition\nHBO has licensed a variety of merchandise based on Game of Thrones, including games, replica weapons and armor, jewelry, bobblehead dolls by Funko, beer by Ommegang and apparel [424] High-end merchandise includes a $10,500 Ulysse Nardin wristwatch [425] and a $30,000 resin replica of the Iron Throne [426] In 2013 and 2014, a traveling exhibition of costumes, props, armor and weapons from the series visited major cities in Europe and the Americas [427] Starting 2018, Diageo released several Game of Thrones themed whiskies [428]\n\n\nRelated shows\nThronecast: The Official Guide to Game of Thrones, a series of podcasts presented by Geoff Lloyd and produced by Koink, were released on the Sky Atlantic website and the UK iTunes store during the series's run;

{"title": "Ottoman_Empire", "content": "\nName\nThe word Ottoman is a historical anglicisation of the name of Osman I, the founder of the Empire and of the ruling House of Osman (also known as the Ottoman dynasty) Osman's name in turn was the Turkish form of the Arabic name ʿUthmān (عثمان) In Ottoman Turkish, the empire was referred to as Devlet-i ʿAlīye-yi ʿOsmānīye (دولت عليه عثمانیه), lit. 'Sublime Ottoman State', or simply Devlet-i ʿOsmānīye (دولت عثمانيه‎), lit. 'Ottoman State'.\n\n\nHistory\nAs the Rum Sultanate declined in the 13th century, Anatolia was divided into a patchwork of independent Turkish principalities known as the Anatolian Beyliks One of these, in the region of Bithynia on the frontier of the Byzantine Empire, was led by the Turkish [35] tribal leader Osman I (d 1323/4), [36] a figure of obscure origins from whom the name Ottoman is derived [37]: 444  Osman's early followers consisted of Turkish tribal groups and Byzantine renegades, with many but not all converts to Islam [38]: 59  [39]: 127  Osman extended control of his principality by conquering Byzantine towns along the Sakarya River A Byzantine defeat at the Battle of Bapheus in 1302 contributed to Osman's rise It is not well understood how the early Ottomans came to dominate their neighbors, due to the lack of sources surviving The Ghaza thesis popular during the 20th century credited their success to rallying religious warriors to fight for them in the name of Islam, but it is no longer generally accepted No other hypothesis has attracted broad acceptance [40]: 5, 10

of these, in the region of Bithynia on the frontier of the Byzantine Empire, was led by the Turkish [35] tribal leader Osman I (d 1323/4), [36] a figure of obscure origins from whom the name Ottoman

of Islam, but it is no longer generally accepted No other hypothesis has attracted broad acceptance [40]: 5, 10  [41]: 104 \n\n\nExpansion and peak (1453–1566)\nThe son of Murad II, Mehmed the Conqueror, reorganized both state and military, and on 29 May 1453 conquered Constantinople, ending the Byzantine Empire [50] Mehmed allowed the Eastern Orthodox Church to maintain its autonomy and land in exchange for accepting Ottoman authority [51] Due to tension between the states of western Europe and the later Byzantine Empire, most of the Orthodox population accepted Ottoman rule, as preferable to Venetian rule [51] Albanian resistance was a major obstacle to Ottoman expansion on the Italian peninsula [52]\n\n\nStagnation and reform (1566–1827)\nIn the second half of the sixteenth century, the Ottoman Empire came under increasing strain from inflation and the rapidly rising costs of warfare that were impacting both Europe and the Middle East [77] These pressures led to a series of crises around the year 1600, placing great strain upon the Ottoman system of government [78]: 413–414  The empire underwent a series of transformations of its political and military institutions in response to these challenges, enabling it to successfully adapt to the new conditions of the seventeenth century and remain powerful, both militarily and economically [66] [79]: 10  Historians of the mid-twentieth century once characterised this period as one of stagnation and decline, but this view is now rejected by the majority of academics [66]\n\n\nRevolts, reversals, and revivals (1566–1683)\nIn the second half of the sixteenth century, the Ottoman Empire came under increasing strain from inflation and the rapidly rising costs of warfare that were impacting both Europe and the Middle East [77] These pressures led to a series of crises around the year 1600, placing great strain upon the Ottoman system of government [78]: 413–414  The empire underwent a series of

militarily and economically [66] [79]: 10  Historians of the mid-twentieth century once characterised this period as one of stagnation and decline, but this view is now rejected by the majority of academics [66]\n\n\nMilitary defeats\nAside from the loss of the Banat and the temporary loss of Belgrade (1717–1739), the Ottoman border on the Danube and Sava remained stable during the eighteenth century Russian expansion, however, presented a large and growing threat [105] Accordingly, King Charles XII of Sweden was welcomed as an ally in the Ottoman Empire following his defeat by the Russians at the Battle of Poltava of 1709 in central Ukraine (part of the Great Northern War of 1700–1721) [105] Charles XII persuaded the Ottoman Sultan Ahmed III to declare war on Russia, which resulted in an Ottoman victory in the Pruth River Campaign of 1710–1711, in Moldavia [106]\n\n\nDecline and modernisation (1828–1908)\nDuring the Tanzimat period (1839–1876), the government's series of constitutional reforms led to a fairly modern conscripted army, banking system reforms, the decriminalization of homosexuality, the replacement of religious law with secular law, [124] and guilds with modern factories The Ottoman Ministry of Post was established in Istanbul in 1840 American inventor Samuel Morse received an Ottoman patent for the telegraph in 1847, issued by Sultan Abdülmecid, who personally tested the invention [125] The reformist period peaked with the Constitution, called the Kanûn-u Esâsî The empire's First Constitutional era was short-lived The parliament survived for only two years before the sultan suspended it.\n\n\nDefeat and dissolution (1908–1922)\nThe defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire (1908—1922) began with the Second Constitutional Era, a moment of hope and promise established with the Young Turk Revolution It restored the Constitution of the Ottoman Empire and brought in multi-party politics with a two-stage electoral system (electoral law) under the Ottoman parliament The constitution offered hope by freeing the empire's citizens to modernise the state's institutions, rejuvenate its strength, and enable it to hold its own against outside powers Its guarantee of liberties promised to dissolve inter-communal tensions and transform the empire into a more harmonious place [152] Instead, this period became the story of the twilight struggle of the Empire.\n\n\nYoung Turk movement\nThe defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire (1908—1922) began with the Second Constitutional Era, a moment of hope and promise established with

liberties promised to dissolve inter-communal tensions and transform the empire into a more harmonious place [152] Instead, this period became the story of the twilight struggle of the Empire.\n\n\nWorld War I\nThe Ottoman Empire entered World War I on the side of the Central Powers and was ultimately defeated [154] The Ottoman participation in the war began with the combined German-Ottoman surprise attack on the Black Sea coast of the Russian Empire on 29 October 1914 Following the attack, the Russian Empire (2 November 1914) [155] and its allies France (5 November 1914) [155] and the British Empire (5 November 1914) [155] declared war on the Ottoman Empire Also on 5 November 1914, the British government changed the status of the Khedivate of Egypt and Cyprus, which were de jure Ottoman territories prior to the war, to British protectorates.\n\n\nGenocides\nIn 1915 the Ottoman government and Kurdish tribes in the region started the extermination of its ethnic Armenian population, resulting in the deaths of up to 1.5 million Armenians in the Armenian genocide [160] [161] [162] The genocide was carried out during and after World War I and implemented in two phases: the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour, followed by the deportation of women, children, the elderly and infirm on death marches leading to the Syrian desert Driven forward by military escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery, rape, and systematic massacre [163] [164] Large-scale massacres were also committed against the Empire's Greek and Assyrian minorities as part of the same campaign of ethnic cleansing [165]\n\n\nArab Revolt\nThe Arab Revolt began in 1916 with British support It turned the tide against the Ottomans on the Middle Eastern front, where they seemed to have the upper hand during the first two years of the war On the basis of the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence, an agreement between the British government and Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca, the revolt was officially initiated at Mecca on 10 June 1916 [o] The Arab nationalist goal was to create a single unified and independent Arab state stretching from Aleppo, Syria, to Aden, Yemen, which the British promised to recognise.\n\n\nTreaty of Sèvres and Turkish War of Independence\nDefeated in World War I, the Ottoman Empire signed the Armistice of Mudros on 30 October 1918 Istanbul was occupied by combined British, French, Italian, and Greek forces In May 1919, Greece also took control of the area around Smyrna (now İzmir).\n\n\nHistoriographical debate on the Ottoman state\nSeveral historians, such as British historian Edward Gibbon and the Greek historian Dimitri Kitsikis, have argued that after the fall of Constantinople, the Ottoman state took over the machinery of the Byzantine (Roman) state and that the Ottoman Empire was in essence a continuation of the Eastern Roman Empire under a Turkish Muslim guise [170] The American historian Speros Vryonis writes that the Ottoman state centered on \"a Byzantine-Balkan base with a veneer of the Turkish language and the Islamic religion\" [171] Kitsikis and the American historian Heath Lowry posit that the early Ottoman state was a predatory confederacy open to both Byzantine Christians and Turkish Muslims whose primary goal was attaining booty and slaves, rather than spreading Islam, and that Islam only later became the empire's primary characteristic [172] [173] [174] Other historians have followed the lead of the Austrian historian Paul Wittek, who emphasizes the early Ottoman state's Islamic character, seeing it as a \"jihad state\" dedicated to expanding the Muslim world [171] Many historians led in 1937 by the Turkish historian Mehmet Fuat Köprülü championed the Ghaza thesis, according to which the early Ottoman state was a continuation of the way of life of the nomadic Turkic tribes who had come from East Asia to Anatolia via Central Asia and the Middle East on a much larger scale They argued that the most important cultural influences on the Ottoman state came from Persia [175]\n\n\nGovernment\nBefore the reforms of the 19th and 20th centuries, the state organisation of the Ottoman Empire was a system with two main dimensions, the military administration, and the civil administration The Sultan was in the highest position in the system The civil system was based on local administrative units based on the region's characteristics The state had control over the clergy Certain pre-Islamic Turkish traditions that had survived the adoption of administrative and legal practices from Islamic Iran remained important in Ottoman administrative circles [179] According to Ottoman understanding, the state's primary responsibility was to defend and extend the land of the Muslims and to ensure security and harmony within its borders in the overarching context of orthodox Islamic practice and dynastic sovereignty [180]\n\n\nLaw\nThe Ottoman legal system accepted the religious law over its subjects At the same time the Qanun (or Kanun), dynastic law, co-existed with religious law or Sharia [188] [189] The Ottoman Empire was always organized around a system of local jurisprudence Legal administration in the Ottoman Empire was part of a larger scheme of balancing central and local authority [190] Ottoman power revolved crucially around the administration of the rights to land, which gave a space for the local authority to develop the needs of the local millet [190] The jurisdictional complexity of the Ottoman Empire was aimed to permit the integration of culturally and religiously different groups [190] The Ottoman system had three court systems: one for Muslims, one for non-Muslims, involving appointed Jews and Christians ruling over their respective religious communities, and the \"trade court\" The entire system was regulated from above by means of the administrative Qanun, i.e., laws, a system based upon the Turkic Yassa and Töre, which were developed in the pre-Islamic era [191] [192]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe first military unit of the Ottoman State was an army that was organized by Osman I from the tribesmen inhabiting the hills of western Anatolia in the late 13th century The military system became an intricate organization with the advance of the Empire The Ottoman military was a complex system of recruiting and fief-holding The main corps of the Ottoman Army included Janissary, Sipahi, Akıncı and Mehterân The Ottoman army was once among the most advanced fighting forces in the world, being one of the first to use muskets and cannons The Ottoman Turks began using falconets, which were short but wide cannons, during the Siege of Constantinople The Ottoman cavalry depended on high speed and mobility rather than heavy armor, using bows and short swords on fast Turkoman and Arabian horses (progenitors of the Thoroughbred racing horse), [195] [196] and often applied tactics similar to those of the Mongol Empire, such as pretending to retreat while surrounding the enemy forces inside a crescent-shaped formation and then making the real attack The Ottoman army continued to be an effective fighting force throughout the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, [197] [198] falling behind the empire's European rivals only during a long period of peace from 1740 to 1768 [64]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThe Ottoman Empire was first subdivided into provinces, in the sense of fixed territorial units with governors appointed by the sultan, in the late 14th century [202]\n\n\nEconomy\nOttoman government deliberately pursued a policy for the development of Bursa, Edirne, and Istanbul, successive Ottoman capitals, into major commercial and industrial centers, considering that merchants and artisans were indispensable in creating a new metropolis [207] To this end, Mehmed and his successor Bayezid, also encouraged and welcomed migration of the Jews from different parts of Europe, who were settled in Istanbul and other port cities like Salonica In many places in Europe, Jews were suffering persecution at the hands of their Christian counterparts, such as in Spain, after the conclusion of the Reconquista The tolerance displayed by the Turks was welcomed by the immigrants.\n\n\nDemographics\nA population estimate for the empire of 11,692,480 for the 1520–1535 period was obtained by counting the households in Ottoman tithe registers, and multiplying this number by 5 [214] For unclear reasons, the population in the 18th century was lower than that in the 16th century [215] An estimate of 7,230,660 for the first census held in 1831 is considered a serious undercount, as this census was meant only to register possible conscripts [214]\n\n\nLanguage\nOttoman Turkish was the official language of the Empire [225] It was an Oghuz Turkic language highly influenced by Persian and Arabic, though lower registries spoken by the common people had fewer influences from other languages compared to higher varieties used by upper classes and governmental authorities [226] Turkish, in its Ottoman variation, was a language of military and administration since the nascent days of the Ottomans The Ottoman constitution of 1876 did officially cement the official imperial status of Turkish [227]\n\n\nReligion\nSunni Islam was the prevailing Dīn (customs, legal traditions, and religion) of the Ottoman Empire; the official Madh'hab (school of Islamic jurisprudence) was Hanafi [232] From the early 16th century until the early 20th century, the Ottoman sultan also served as the caliph, or politico-religious leader, of the Muslim world Most of the Ottoman Sultans adhered to Sufism and followed Sufi orders, and believed Sufism was the correct way to reach God [233]\n\n\nIslam\nTurkic peoples practiced a form of shamanism before adopting Islam The Muslim conquest of Transoxiana under the Abbasids facilitated the spread of Islam into the Turkic heartland of Central Asia Many Turkic tribes—including the Oghuz Turks, who were the ancestors of both the Seljuks and the Ottomans—gradually converted to Islam and brought religion to Anatolia through their migrations beginning in the 11th century From its founding, the Ottoman Empire officially supported the Maturidi school of Islamic theology, which emphasized human reason, rationality, the pursuit of science and philosophy (falsafa) [235] [236] The Ottomans were among the earliest and most enthusiastic adopters of the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence, [237] which was comparatively more flexible and discretionary in its rulings [238] [239]\n\n\nChristianity and Judaism\nIn accordance with the Muslim dhimmi system, the Ottoman Empire guaranteed limited freedoms to Christians, Jews, and other \"people of the book\", such as the right to worship, own property, and be exempt from the obligatory alms (zakat) required of Muslims However, non-Muslims (or dhimmi) were subject to various legal restrictions, including being forbidden to carry weapons, ride on horseback, or have their homes overlook those of Muslims; likewise, they were required to pay higher taxes than Muslim subjects, including the jizya, which was a key source of state revenue [244] [245] Many Christians and Jews converted to Islam to secure full social and legal status, though most continued to practice their faith without restriction.\n\n\nSocial-political-religious structure\nBeginning in the early 19th century, society, government, and religion were interrelated in a complex, overlapping way that was deemed inefficient by Atatürk, who systematically dismantled it after 1922 [251] [252] In Constantinople, the Sultan ruled two distinct domains: the secular government and the religious hierarchy Religious officials formed the Ulama, who had control of religious teachings and theology, and also the Empire's judicial system, giving them a major voice in day-to-day affairs in communities across the Empire (but not including the non-Muslim millets) They were powerful enough to reject the military reforms proposed by Sultan Selim III His successor Sultan Mahmud II (r 1808–1839) first won ulama approval before proposing similar reforms [253] The secularisation program brought by Atatürk ended the ulema and their institutions The caliphate was abolished, madrasas were closed down, and the sharia courts were abolished He replaced the Arabic alphabet with Latin letters, ended the religious school system, and gave women some political rights Many rural traditionalists never accepted this secularisation, and by the 1990s they were reasserting a demand for a larger role for Islam [254]\n\n\nCulture\nThe Ottomans absorbed some of the traditions, art, and institutions of cultures in the regions they conquered and added new dimensions to them Numerous traditions and cultural traits of previous empires (in fields such as architecture, cuisine, music, leisure, and government) were adopted by the Ottoman Turks, who developed them into new forms, resulting in a new and distinctively Ottoman cultural identity Although the predominant literary language of the Ottoman Empire was Turkish, Persian was the preferred vehicle for the projection of an imperial image [262]\n\n\nEducation\nIn the Ottoman Empire, each millet established a schooling system serving its members [268] Education was therefore largely divided on ethnic and religious lines: few non-Muslims attended schools for Muslim students, and vice versa Most institutions that served all ethnic and religious groups taught in French or other languages [269]\n\n\nLiterature\nThe two primary streams of Ottoman written literature are poetry and prose Poetry was by far the dominant stream The earliest work of Ottoman historiography for example, the İskendernâme, was composed by the poet Taceddin Ahmedi (1334–1413) [271] Until the 19th century, Ottoman prose did not contain any examples of fiction: there were no counterparts to, for instance, the European romance, short story, or novel Analog genres did exist, though, in both Turkish folk literature and in Divan poetry.\n\n\nMedia\nThe media of the Ottoman Empire was diverse, with newspapers and journals published in languages including French, [278] Greek, [279] and German [247] Many of these publications were centered in Constantinople, [280] but there were also French-language newspapers produced in Beirut, Salonika, and Smyrna [281] Non-Muslim ethnic minorities in the empire used French as a lingua franca and used French-language publications, [278] while some provincial newspapers were published in Arabic [282] The use of French in the media persisted until the end of the empire in 1923 and for a few years thereafter in the Republic of Turkey [278]\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe architecture of the empire developed from earlier Seljuk Turkish architecture, with influences from Byzantine and Iranian architecture and other architectural traditions in the Middle East [283] [284] [285] Early Ottoman architecture experimented with multiple building types over the course of the 13th to 15th centuries, progressively evolving into the Classical Ottoman style of the 16th and 17th centuries, which was also strongly influenced by the Hagia Sophia [285] [286] The most important architect of the Classical period is Mimar Sinan, whose major works include the Şehzade Mosque, Süleymaniye Mosque, and Selimiye Mosque [287] [288] The greatest of the court artists enriched the Ottoman Empire with many pluralistic artistic influences, such as mixing traditional Byzantine art with elements of Chinese art [289] The second half of the 16th century also saw the apogee of certain decorative arts, most notably in the use of Iznik tiles [290]\n\n\nDecorative arts\nThe tradition of Ottoman miniatures, painted to illustrate manuscripts or used in dedicated albums, was heavily influenced by the Persian art form, though it also included elements of the Byzantine tradition of illumination and painting [301] A Greek academy of painters, the Nakkashane-i-Rum, was established in the Topkapi Palace in the 15th century, while early in the following century a similar Persian academy, the Nakkashane-i-Irani, was added Surname-i Hümayun (Imperial Festival Books) were albums that commemorated celebrations in the Ottoman Empire in pictorial and textual detail.\n\n\nMusic and performing arts\nOttoman classical music was an important part of the education of the Ottoman elite A number of the Ottoman sultans have accomplished musicians and composers themselves, such as Selim III, whose compositions are often still performed today Ottoman classical music arose largely from a confluence of Byzantine music, Armenian music, Arabic music, and Persian music Compositionally, it is organized around rhythmic units called usul, which are somewhat similar to meter in Western music, and melodic units called makam, which bear some resemblance to Western musical modes.\n\n\nCuisine\nOttoman cuisine is the cuisine of the capital, Constantinople (Istanbul), and the regional capital cities, where the melting pot of cultures created a common cuisine that most of the population regardless of ethnicity shared This diverse cuisine was honed in the Imperial Palace's kitchens by chefs brought from certain parts of the Empire to create and experiment with different ingredients The creations of the Ottoman Palace's kitchens filtered to the population, for instance through Ramadan events, and through the cooking at the Yalıs of the Pashas, and from there on spread to the rest of the population.\n\n\nSports\nThe main sports Ottomans were engaged in were Turkish wrestling, hunting, Turkish archery, horseback riding, equestrian javelin throw, arm wrestling, and swimming European model sports clubs were formed with the spreading popularity of football matches in 19th century Constantinople The leading clubs, according to timeline, were Beşiktaş Gymnastics Club (1903), Galatasaray Sports Club (1905), Fenerbahçe Sports Club (1907), MKE Ankaragücü (formerly Turan Sanatkarangücü) (1910) in Constantinople Football clubs were formed in other provinces too, such as Karşıyaka Sports Club (1912), Altay Sports Club (1914) and Turkish Fatherland Football Club (later Ülküspor) (1914) of İzmir.\n\n\nScience and technology\nOver the course of Ottoman history, the Ottomans managed to build a large collection of libraries complete with translations of books from other cultures, as well as original manuscripts [59] A great part of this desire for local and foreign manuscripts arose in the 15th century Sultan Mehmet II ordered Georgios Amiroutzes, a Greek scholar from Trabzon, to translate and make available to Ottoman educational institutions the geography book of Ptolemy Another example is Ali Qushji – an astronomer, mathematician and physicist originally from Samarkand – who became a professor in two madrasas and influenced Ottoman circles as a result of his writings and the activities of his students, even though he only spent two or three years in Constantinople before his death [307]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther

and most influential empires in history. It was founded in the late 13th century by Osman I, a Turkish tribal leader, and lasted until its dissolution in the early 20th century.\n\n## Name\n\nThe word \"Ottoman\" is a historical anglicization of the name of Osman I, the founder of the Empire and of the ruling House of Osman (also known as the Ottoman dynasty). Osman's name in turn was the Turkish form of the Arabic name ʿUthmān (عثمان), which means \"lion\". In Ottoman Turkish, the empire was referred to as Devlet-i ʿAlīye-yi ʿOsmānīye (دولت عليه عثمانيه), which translates to \"Sublime Ottoman State\", or simply Devlet-i ʿOsmānīye (دولت عثمانيه), which means \"Ottoman State\".\n\n## Rise (c. 1299–1453)\n\nAs the Rum Sultanate declined in the 13th century, Anatolia was divided into a patchwork of independent Turkish principalities known as the Anatolian Beyliks. One of these, in the region of Bithynia on the frontier of the Byzantine Empire, was led by the Turkish tribal leader Osman I (d 1323/4). Osman's early followers consisted of Turkish tribal groups and Byzantine renegades, with many but not all converts to Islam. Osman extended control of his principality by conquering Byzantine towns along the Sakarya River. A Byzantine defeat at the Battle of Bapheus in 1302 contributed to Osman's rise. It is not well understood how the early Ottomans came to dominate their neighbors, due to the lack of sources surviving.\n\n## Expansion and Peak (1453–1566)\n\nThe son of Murad II, Mehmed the Conqueror, reorganized both state and military, and on 29 May 1453 conquered Constantinople, ending the Byzantine Empire. Mehmed allowed the Eastern Orthodox Church to maintain its autonomy and land in exchange for accepting Ottoman authority. Due to tension between the states of western Europe and the later Byzantine Empire, most of the Orthodox population accepted Ottoman rule, as preferable to Venetian rule. Albanian resistance was a major obstacle to Ottoman expansion on the Italian peninsula.\n\n## Stagnation and Reform (1566–1827)\n\nIn the second half of the sixteenth century, the Ottoman Empire came under increasing strain from inflation and the rapidly rising costs of warfare that were impacting both Europe and the Middle East. These pressures led to a series of crises around the year 1600, placing great strain upon the Ottoman system of government. The empire underwent a series of transformations of its political and military institutions in response to these challenges, enabling it to successfully adapt to the new conditions of the seventeenth century and remain powerful, both militarily and economically.\n\n## Revolts, Reversals, and Revivals (1566–1683)\n\nIn the second half of the sixteenth century, the Ottoman Empire came under increasing strain from inflation and the rapidly rising costs of warfare that were impacting both Europe and the Middle East. These pressures led to a series of crises around the year 1600, placing great strain upon the Ottoman system of government. The empire underwent a series of transformations of its political and military institutions in response to these challenges, enabling it to successfully adapt to the new conditions of the seventeenth century and remain powerful, both militarily and economically.\n\n## Military Defeats\n\nAside from the loss of the Banat and the temporary loss of Belgrade (1717–1739), the Ottoman border on the Danube and Sava remained stable during the eighteenth century. Russian expansion, however, presented a large and growing threat. Accordingly, King Charles XII of Sweden was welcomed as an ally in the Ottoman Empire following his defeat by the Russians at the Battle of Poltava of 1709 in central Ukraine.\n\n## Decline and Modernisation (1828–1908)\n\nDuring the Tanzimat period (1839–1876), the government's series of constitutional reforms led to a fairly modern conscripted army, banking system reforms, the decriminalization of homosexuality, the replacement of religious law with secular law, and guilds with modern factories. The Ottoman Ministry of Post was established in Istanbul in 1840. American inventor Samuel Morse received an Ottoman patent for the telegraph in 1847, issued by Sultan Abdülmecid, who personally tested the invention.\n\n## Defeat and Dissolution (1908–1922)\n\nThe defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire (1908—1922) began with the Second Constitutional Era, a moment of hope and promise established with the Young Turk Revolution. It restored the Constitution of the Ottoman Empire and brought in multi-party politics with a two-stage electoral system (electoral law) under the Ottoman parliament. The constitution offered hope by freeing the empire's citizens to modernise the state's institutions, rejuvenate its strength, and enable it to hold its own against outside powers.\n\n## Government\n\nBefore the reforms of the 19th and 20th centuries, the state organisation of the Ottoman Empire was a system with two main dimensions, the military administration, and the civil administration. The Sultan was in the highest position in the system. The civil system was based on local administrative units based on the region's characteristics. The state had control over the clergy. Certain pre-Islamic Turkish traditions that had survived the adoption of administrative and legal practices from Islamic Iran remained important in Ottoman administrative circles.\n\n## Law\n\nThe Ottoman legal system accepted the religious law over its subjects. At the same time, the Qanun (or Kanun), dynastic law, co-existed with religious law or Sharia. The Ottoman Empire was always organised around a system of local jurisprudence. Legal administration in the Ottoman Empire was part of a larger scheme of balancing central and local authority.\n\n## Military\n\nThe first military unit of the Ottoman State was an army that was organised by Osman I from the tribesmen inhabiting the hills of western Anatolia in the late 13th century. The military system became an intricate organisation with the advance of the Empire. The Ottoman military was a complex system of recruiting and fief-holding.\n\n## Administrative Divisions\n\nThe Ottoman Empire was first subdivided into provinces, in the sense of fixed territorial units with governors appointed by the sultan, in the late 14th century.\n\n## Economy\n\nOttoman government deliberately pursued a policy for the development of Bursa, Edirne, and Istanbul, successive Ottoman capitals, into major commercial and industrial centers. To this end, Mehmed and his successor Bayezid, also encouraged and welcomed migration of the Jews from different parts of Europe, who were settled in Istanbul and other port cities like Salonica.\n\n## Demographics\n\nA population estimate for the empire of 11,692,480 for the 1520–1535 period was obtained by counting the households in Ottoman tithe registers, and multiplying this number by 5.

Great Northern War of 1700–1721) [105] Charles XII persuaded the Ottoman Sultan Ahmed III to declare war on Russia, which resulted in an Ottoman victory in the Pruth River Campaign of 1710–1711, in Moldavia [106]\n\n\nDecline and modernisation (1828–1908)\nDuring the Tanzimat period (1839–1876), the government's series of constitutional reforms led to a fairly modern conscripted army, banking

Central Powers and was ultimately defeated [154] The Ottoman participation in the war began with the combined German-Ottoman surprise attack on the Black Sea coast of the Russian Empire on 29 October 1914 Following the attack, the Russian Empire (2 November 1914) [155] and its allies France (5 November 1914) [155] and the British Empire (5 November 1914) [155] declared war on the Ottoman Empire Also on 5 November 1914, the British government changed the status of the Khedivate of Egypt and Cyprus, which were de jure Ottoman territories prior to the war, to British protectorates.\n\n\nGenocides\nIn 1915 the Ottoman government and Kurdish tribes in the region started the extermination of its ethnic Armenian population, resulting in the deaths of up to 1.5 million Armenians in the Armenian genocide [160] [161] [162] The genocide was carried out during and after World War I and implemented in two phases: the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour, followed by the deportation of women, children, the elderly and infirm on death marches leading to the Syrian desert Driven forward by military escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery, rape, and systematic massacre [163] [164] Large-scale massacres were also committed against the Empire's Greek and Assyrian minorities as part of the same campaign of ethnic cleansing [165]\n\n\nArab Revolt\nThe Arab Revolt began in 1916 with British support It turned the tide against the Ottomans on the Middle Eastern front, where they seemed to have the upper hand during the first two years of the war On the basis of the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence, an agreement between the British government and Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca, the revolt was officially initiated at Mecca on 10 June 1916 [o] The Arab nationalist goal was to create a single unified and independent Arab state stretching from Aleppo, Syria, to Aden, Yemen, which the British promised to recognise.\n\n\nTreaty of Sèvres and Turkish War of Independence\nDefeated in World War I, the Ottoman Empire signed the Armistice of Mudros on 30 October 1918 Istanbul was occupied by combined British, French, Italian, and Greek forces In May 1919, Greece also took control of the area around Smyrna (now İzmir).\n\n\nHistoriographical debate on the Ottoman state\nSeveral historians, such as British historian Edward Gibbon and the Greek historian Dimitri Kitsikis, have argued that after the fall of Constantinople, the Ottoman state took over the machinery of the Byzantine (Roman) state and that the Ottoman Empire was in essence a continuation of the Eastern Roman Empire under a Turkish Muslim guise [170] The American historian Speros Vryonis writes that the Ottoman state centered on \"a Byzantine-Balkan base with a veneer of the Turkish language and the Islamic religion\" [171] Kitsikis and the American historian Heath Lowry posit that the early Ottoman state was a predatory confederacy open to both Byzantine Christians and Turkish Muslims whose primary goal was attaining booty and slaves, rather than spreading Islam, and that Islam only later became the empire's primary characteristic [172] [173] [174] Other historians have followed the lead of the Austrian historian Paul Wittek, who emphasizes the early Ottoman state's Islamic character, seeing it as a \"jihad state\" dedicated to expanding the Muslim world [171] Many historians led in 1937 by the Turkish historian Mehmet Fuat Köprülü championed the Ghaza thesis, according to which the early Ottoman state was a continuation of the way of life of the nomadic Turkic tribes who had come from East Asia to Anatolia via Central Asia and the Middle East on a much larger scale They argued that the most important cultural influences on the Ottoman state came from Persia [175]\n\n\nGovernment\nBefore the reforms of the 19th and 20th centuries, the state organisation of the Ottoman Empire was a system with two main dimensions, the military administration, and the civil administration The Sultan was in the highest position in the system The civil system was based on local administrative units based on the region's characteristics The state had control over the clergy Certain pre-Islamic Turkish traditions that had survived the adoption of administrative and legal practices from Islamic Iran remained important in Ottoman administrative circles [179] According to Ottoman understanding, the state's primary responsibility was to defend and extend the land of the Muslims and to ensure security and harmony within its borders in the overarching context of orthodox Islamic practice and dynastic sovereignty [180]\n\n\nLaw\nThe Ottoman legal system accepted the religious law over its subjects At the same time the Qanun (or Kanun), dynastic law, co-existed with religious law or Sharia [188] [189] The Ottoman Empire was always organized around a system of local jurisprudence Legal administration in the Ottoman Empire was part of a larger scheme of balancing central and local authority [190] Ottoman power revolved crucially around the administration of the rights to land, which gave a space for the local authority to develop the needs of the local millet [190] The jurisdictional complexity of the Ottoman Empire was aimed to permit the integration of culturally and religiously different groups [190] The Ottoman system had three court systems: one for Muslims, one for non-Muslims, involving appointed Jews and Christians ruling over their respective religious communities, and the \"trade court\" The entire system was regulated from above by means of the administrative Qanun, i.e., laws, a system based upon the Turkic Yassa and Töre, which were developed in the pre-Islamic era [191] [192]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe first military unit of the Ottoman State was an army that was organized by Osman I from the tribesmen inhabiting the hills of western Anatolia in the late 13th century The military system became an intricate organization with the advance of the Empire The Ottoman military was a complex system of recruiting and fief-holding The main corps of the Ottoman Army included Janissary, Sipahi, Akıncı and Mehterân The Ottoman army was once among the most advanced fighting forces in the world, being one of the first to use muskets and cannons The Ottoman Turks began using falconets, which were short but wide cannons, during the Siege of Constantinople The Ottoman cavalry depended on high speed and mobility rather than heavy armor, using bows and short swords on fast Turkoman and Arabian horses (progenitors of the Thoroughbred racing horse), [195] [196] and often applied tactics similar to those of the Mongol Empire, such as pretending to retreat while surrounding the enemy forces inside a crescent-shaped formation and then making the real attack The Ottoman army continued to be an effective fighting force throughout the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, [197] [198] falling behind the empire's European rivals only during a long period of peace from 1740 to 1768 [64]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThe Ottoman Empire was first subdivided into provinces, in the sense of fixed territorial units with governors appointed by the sultan, in the late 14th century [202]\n\n\nEconomy\nOttoman government deliberately pursued a policy for the development of Bursa, Edirne, and Istanbul, successive Ottoman capitals, into major commercial and industrial centers, considering that merchants and artisans were indispensable in creating a new metropolis [207] To this end, Mehmed and his successor Bayezid, also encouraged and welcomed migration of the Jews from different parts of Europe, who were settled in Istanbul and other port cities like Salonica In many places in Europe, Jews were suffering persecution at the hands of their Christian counterparts, such as in Spain, after the conclusion of the Reconquista The tolerance displayed by the Turks was welcomed by the immigrants.\n\n\nDemographics\nA population estimate for the empire of 11,692,480 for the 1520–1535 period was obtained by counting the households in Ottoman tithe registers, and multiplying this number by 5 [214] For unclear reasons, the population in the 18th century was lower than that in the 16th century [215] An estimate of 7,230,660 for the first census held in 1831 is considered a serious undercount, as this census was meant only to register possible conscripts [214]\n\n\nLanguage\nOttoman Turkish was the official language of the Empire [225] It was an Oghuz Turkic language highly influenced by Persian and Arabic, though lower registries spoken by the common people had fewer influences from other languages compared to higher varieties used by upper classes and governmental authorities [226] Turkish, in its Ottoman variation, was a language of military and administration since the nascent days of the Ottomans The Ottoman constitution of 1876 did officially cement the official imperial status of Turkish [227]\n\n\nReligion\nSunni Islam was the prevailing Dīn (customs, legal traditions, and religion) of the Ottoman Empire; the official Madh'hab (school of Islamic jurisprudence) was Hanafi [232] From the early 16th century until the early 20th century, the Ottoman sultan also served as the caliph, or politico-religious leader, of the Muslim world Most of the Ottoman Sultans adhered to Sufism and followed Sufi orders, and believed Sufism was the correct way to reach God [233]\n\n\nIslam\nTurkic peoples practiced a form of shamanism before adopting Islam The Muslim conquest of Transoxiana under the Abbasids facilitated the spread of Islam into the Turkic heartland of Central Asia Many Turkic tribes—including the Oghuz Turks, who were the ancestors of both the Seljuks and the Ottomans—gradually converted to Islam and brought religion to Anatolia through their migrations beginning in the 11th century From its founding, the Ottoman Empire officially supported the Maturidi school of Islamic theology, which emphasized human reason, rationality, the pursuit of science and philosophy (falsafa) [235] [236] The Ottomans were among the earliest and most enthusiastic adopters of the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence, [237] which was comparatively more flexible and discretionary in its rulings [238] [239]\n\n\nChristianity and Judaism\nIn accordance with the Muslim dhimmi system, the Ottoman Empire guaranteed limited freedoms to Christians, Jews, and other \"people of the book\", such as the right to worship, own property, and be exempt from the obligatory alms (zakat) required of Muslims However, non-Muslims (or dhimmi) were subject to various legal restrictions, including being forbidden to carry weapons, ride on horseback, or have their homes overlook those of Muslims; likewise, they were required to pay higher taxes than Muslim subjects, including the jizya, which was a key source of state revenue [244] [245] Many Christians and Jews converted to Islam to secure full social and legal status, though most continued to practice their faith without restriction.\n\n\nSocial-political-religious structure\nBeginning in the early 19th century, society, government, and religion were interrelated in a complex, overlapping way that was deemed inefficient by Atatürk, who systematically dismantled it after 1922 [251] [252] In Constantinople, the Sultan ruled two distinct domains: the secular government and the religious hierarchy Religious officials formed the Ulama, who had control of religious teachings and theology, and also the Empire's judicial system, giving them a major voice in day-to-day affairs in communities across the Empire (but not including the non-Muslim millets) They were powerful enough to reject the military reforms proposed by Sultan Selim III His successor Sultan Mahmud II (r 1808–1839) first won ulama approval before proposing similar reforms [253] The secularisation program brought by Atatürk ended the ulema and their institutions The caliphate was abolished, madrasas were closed down, and the sharia courts were abolished He replaced the Arabic alphabet with Latin letters, ended the religious school system, and gave women some political rights Many rural traditionalists never accepted this secularisation, and by the 1990s they were reasserting a demand for a larger role for Islam [254]\n\n\nCulture\nThe Ottomans absorbed some of the traditions, art, and institutions of cultures in the regions they conquered and added new dimensions to them Numerous traditions and cultural traits of previous empires (in fields such as architecture, cuisine, music, leisure, and government) were adopted by the Ottoman Turks, who developed them into new forms, resulting in a new and distinctively Ottoman cultural identity Although the predominant literary language of the Ottoman Empire was Turkish, Persian was the preferred vehicle for the projection of an imperial image [262]\n\n\nEducation\nIn the Ottoman Empire, each millet established a schooling system serving its members [268] Education was therefore largely divided on ethnic and religious lines: few non-Muslims attended schools for Muslim students, and vice versa Most institutions that served all ethnic and religious groups taught in French or other languages [269]\n\n\nLiterature\nThe two primary streams of Ottoman written literature are poetry and prose Poetry was by far the dominant stream The earliest work of Ottoman historiography for example, the İskendernâme, was composed by the poet Taceddin Ahmedi (1334–1413) [271] Until the 19th century, Ottoman prose did not contain any examples of fiction: there were no counterparts to, for instance, the European romance, short story, or novel Analog genres did exist, though, in both Turkish folk literature and in Divan poetry.\n\n\nMedia\nThe media of the Ottoman Empire was diverse, with newspapers and journals published in languages including French, [278] Greek, [279] and German [247] Many of these publications were centered in Constantinople, [280] but there were also French-language newspapers produced in Beirut, Salonika, and Smyrna [281] Non-Muslim ethnic minorities in the empire used French as a lingua franca and used French-language publications, [278] while some provincial newspapers were published in Arabic [282] The use of French in the media persisted until the end of the empire in 1923 and for a few years thereafter in the Republic of Turkey [278]\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe architecture of the empire developed from earlier Seljuk Turkish architecture, with influences from Byzantine and Iranian architecture and other architectural traditions in the Middle East [283] [284] [285] Early Ottoman architecture experimented with multiple building types over the course of the 13th to 15th centuries, progressively evolving into the Classical Ottoman style of the 16th and 17th centuries, which was also strongly influenced by the Hagia Sophia [285] [286] The most important architect of the Classical period is Mimar Sinan, whose major works include the Şehzade Mosque, Süleymaniye Mosque, and Selimiye Mosque [287] [288] The greatest of the court artists enriched the Ottoman Empire with many pluralistic artistic influences, such as mixing traditional Byzantine art with elements of Chinese art [289] The second half of the 16th century also saw the apogee of certain decorative arts, most notably in the use of Iznik tiles [290]\n\n\nDecorative arts\nThe tradition of Ottoman miniatures, painted to illustrate manuscripts or used in dedicated albums, was heavily influenced by the Persian art form, though it also included elements of the Byzantine tradition of illumination and painting [301] A Greek academy of painters, the Nakkashane-i-Rum, was established in the Topkapi Palace in the 15th century, while early in the following century a similar Persian academy, the Nakkashane-i-Irani, was added Surname-i Hümayun (Imperial Festival Books) were albums that commemorated celebrations in the Ottoman Empire in pictorial and textual detail.\n\n\nMusic and performing arts\nOttoman classical music was an important part of the education of the Ottoman elite A number of the Ottoman sultans have accomplished musicians and composers themselves, such as Selim III, whose compositions are often still performed today Ottoman classical music arose largely from a confluence of Byzantine music, Armenian music, Arabic music, and Persian music Compositionally, it is organized around rhythmic units called usul, which are somewhat similar to meter in Western music, and melodic units called makam, which bear some resemblance to Western musical modes.\n\n\nCuisine\nOttoman cuisine is the cuisine of the capital, Constantinople (Istanbul), and the regional capital cities, where the melting pot of cultures created a common cuisine that most of the population regardless of ethnicity shared This diverse cuisine was honed in the Imperial Palace's kitchens by chefs brought from certain parts of the Empire to create and experiment with different ingredients The creations of the Ottoman Palace's kitchens filtered to the population, for instance through Ramadan events, and through the cooking at the Yalıs of the Pashas, and from there on spread to the rest of the population.\n\n\nSports\nThe main sports Ottomans were engaged in were Turkish wrestling, hunting, Turkish archery, horseback riding, equestrian javelin throw, arm wrestling, and swimming European model sports clubs were formed with the spreading popularity of football matches in 19th century Constantinople The leading clubs, according to timeline, were Beşiktaş Gymnastics Club (1903), Galatasaray Sports Club (1905), Fenerbahçe Sports Club (1907), MKE Ankaragücü (formerly Turan Sanatkarangücü) (1910) in Constantinople Football clubs were formed in other provinces too, such as Karşıyaka Sports Club (1912), Altay Sports Club (1914) and Turkish Fatherland Football Club (later Ülküspor) (1914) of İzmir.\n\n\nScience and technology\nOver the course of Ottoman history, the Ottomans managed to build a large collection of libraries complete with translations of books from other cultures, as well as original manuscripts [59] A great part of this desire for local and foreign manuscripts arose in the 15th century Sultan Mehmet II ordered Georgios Amiroutzes, a Greek scholar from Trabzon, to translate and make available to Ottoman educational institutions the geography book of Ptolemy Another example is Ali Qushji – an astronomer, mathematician and physicist originally from Samarkand – who became a professor in two madrasas and influenced Ottoman circles as a result of his writings and the activities of his students, even though he only spent two or three years in Constantinople before his death [307]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nGeneral surveys\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

close friend Harriet Deutsch was quoted as saying, \"Nancy has her own imprint.\" [82]\n\n\nExtravagance\nApproximately a year into her husband's first term, Nancy explored the idea of ordering new state china service for the White House [97] A full china service had not been purchased since the Truman administration in the 1940s, as only a partial service was ordered in the Johnson administration [97] She was quoted as saying, \"The White House really badly, badly needs china.\" [97] Working with Lenox, the primary porcelain manufacturer in America, the first lady chose a design scheme of a red with etched gold band, bordering the scarlet and cream colored ivory plates with a raised presidential seal etched in gold in the center [97] The full service comprised 4,370 pieces, with 19 pieces per individual set [97] The service totaled $209,508 [98] Although it was paid for by private donations, some from the private J P Knapp Foundation, the purchase generated quite a controversy, for it was ordered at a time when the nation was undergoing an economic recession [99] Furthermore, news of the china purchase emerged at the same time that her husband's administration had proposed school lunch regulations that would allow ketchup to be counted as a vegetable [100]\n\n\nJust Say No\nWith the help of her Chief of Staff James Rosebush, the first lady launched the \"Just Say No\" drug awareness campaign in 1982, which was her primary project and major initiative as first lady [13] Reagan first became aware of the need to educate young people about drugs during a 1980 campaign stop in Daytop village, New York [118] She remarked in 1981 that \"Understanding what drugs can do to your children, understanding peer pressure and understanding why they turn to drugs is .. the first step in solving the problem.\" [118] Her campaign focused on drug education and informing the youth of the danger of drug abuse [118]\n\n\nHer husband's protector\nReagan assumed the role of unofficial \"protector\" for her husband after the attempted assassination of him in 1981 [124] On March 30 of that year, President Reagan and three others were shot by the attempted assassin 25-year old John Hinckley, Jr as they left the Washington Hilton hotel Nancy was alerted and arrived at George Washington University Hospital, where the President was hospitalized She recalled having seen \"emergency rooms before, but I had never seen one like this – with my husband in it.\" [125] She was escorted into a waiting room, and when granted access to see her husband, he quipped to her, \"Honey, I forgot to duck\", borrowing the defeated boxer Jack Dempsey's jest to his wife [126]\n\n\nAstrological consultations\nDuring the Reagan administration, Nancy Reagan consulted a San Francisco astrologer, Joan Quigley, who provided advice on which days and times would be optimal for the president's safety and success [13] [130] Quigley began her work at the White House after the assassination attempt on President Reagan in 1981 Nancy Reagan was told by Merv Griffin that Quigley had predicted that day would be dangerous for President Reagan, causing her to become a regular astrological consultant for the administration [131] Quigley previously worked on the Reagan campaign prior to serving as their astrological consultant She volunteered for their campaign in 1980, as she was impressed by his astrological chart Private lines were set up in the White House and Camp David to assist in phone calls between Nancy Reagan and Joan Quigley, which occurred multiple times a day, and she was paid $3,000 a month for her work [132]\n\n\nInfluence in the White House\nNancy Reagan wielded a powerful influence over President Reagan [141]\nIn her memoirs, Reagan stated, \"I felt panicky every time  [Ronald Reagan] left the White House\" [142] Following the assassination attempt, she strictly controlled access to the president; [13] [141] occasionally, she even attempted to influence her husband's decision making [143]\n\n\nBreast cancer\nIn October 1987, a mammogram detected a lesion in Reagan's left breast and she was subsequently diagnosed with breast cancer She chose to undergo a mastectomy rather than a lumpectomy, [150] and the breast was removed on October 17, 1987 Ten days after the operation, her 99-year-old mother, Edith Luckett Davis, died in Phoenix, Arizona, leading Reagan to dub the period \"a terrible month\" [151]\n\n\nLater life\nThough Reagan was a controversial first lady, 56 percent of Americans had a favorable opinion of her when her husband left office on January 20, 1989, with 18 percent having an unfavorable opinion, and the balance not giving an opinion [153] Compared to fellow first ladies when their husbands left office, Reagan's approval was higher than those of Rosalynn Carter, Hillary Clinton and Melania Trump However, she was less popular than Barbara Bush and Michelle Obama, and her disapproval rating was double that of Carter's [153]\n\n\nEarly post–White House activities\nIn late 1989, the former first lady established the Nancy Reagan Foundation, which aimed to continue to educate people about the dangers of substance abuse [158] The Foundation teamed with the BEST Foundation For A Drug-Free Tomorrow in 1994, and developed the Nancy Reagan Afterschool Program She continued to travel around the United States, speaking out against drug and alcohol abuse.\n\n\nFuneral for President Reagan\nRonald Reagan died in their Bel Air home on June 5, 2004 [157] During the seven-day state funeral, Nancy, accompanied by her children and military escort, led the nation in mourning [169] She kept a strong composure, [170] traveling from her home to the Reagan Library for a memorial service, then to Washington, D.C., where her husband's body lay in state for 34 hours prior to a national funeral service in the Washington National Cathedral [171] She returned to the library in Simi Valley for a sunset memorial service and interment, where, overcome with emotion, she lost her composure and cried in public for the first time during the week [170] [172] After receiving the folded flag, she kissed the casket and mouthed \"I love you\" before leaving [173] During the week, CNN journalist Wolf Blitzer said, \"She's a very, very strong woman, even though she looks frail.\" [174]\n\n\nWidowhood\nFollowing her husband's death, Reagan remained active in politics, particularly relating to stem cell research Beginning in 2004, she favored what many consider to be the Democratic Party's position, and urged President George W Bush to support federally funded embryonic stem cell research, in the hope that this science could lead to a cure for Alzheimer's disease [176] Although she failed to change the president's position, she did support his campaign for a second term [177]\n\n\nDeath and funeral\nOn March 6, 2016, Nancy Reagan died of congestive heart failure at her home in Los Angeles at the age of 94 [202] [203] [204] On March 7, President Barack Obama issued a presidential proclamation ordering the US flag to be flown at half-staff until sunset on the day of Reagan's interment [205]\n\n\nHistorical assessments\nSince 1982 Siena College Research Institute has conducted occasional surveys asking historians to assess American first ladies according to a cumulative score on the independent criteria of their background, value to the country, intelligence, courage, accomplishments, integrity, leadership, being their own women, public image, and value to the president [211] In terms of cumulative assessment Reagan has been ranked:\n\n\nAwards and honors\nAs noted earlier, Nancy Reagan was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2002 [167] and the Congressional Gold Medal, in the same year [168]\nIn 1989, she received the Council of Fashion Designers of America's lifetime achievement award [96]\n\n\nFilmography\nAs Nancy Davis, she also made a number of television appearances from 1953 to 1962, as a guest star in dramatic shows or installments of anthology series These included Ford Television Theatre (her first appearance with Ronald Reagan came during a 1953 episode titled \"First Born\"), Schlitz Playhouse of Stars, Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre (appearing with Ronald Reagan in the 1961 episode \"The Long Shadow\"), Wagon Train, The Tall Man, and General Electric Theater (hosted by Ronald Reagan).\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Crimean_War", "content": "\nEastern question\nAs the Ottoman Empire steadily weakened during the 19th century, the Russian Empire stood poised to take advantage by expanding southward In the 1850s, the British and the French Empires were allied with the Ottoman Empire and were determined to prevent that from happening [13] The historian A J P Taylor argued that the war had resulted not from aggression, but from the interacting fears of the major players:\n\n\nWeakening of the Ottoman Empire: 1820–1840s\nIn the early 1800s, the Ottoman Empire suffered a number of existential challenges The Serbian Revolution in 1804 resulted in the autonomy of the first Balkan Christian nation under the empire The Greek War of Independence, which began in early 1821, provided further evidence of the empire's internal and military weakness, and the commission of atrocities by Ottoman military forces (see Chios massacre) further undermined the empire The disbandment of the centuries-old Janissary corps by Sultan Mahmud II on 15 June 1826 (Auspicious Incident) helped the empire in the longer term but deprived it of its existing standing army in the short term [clarification needed] In 1827, the Anglo-Franco-Russian fleet destroyed almost all of the Ottoman naval forces at the Battle of Navarino In 1830, Greece became independent after ten years of war and the Russo-Turkish War (1828–29) The Treaty of Adrianople (1829) granted Russian and Western European commercial ships free passage through the Black Sea straits Also, Serbia received autonomy, and the Danubian Principalities (Moldavia and Wallachia) became territories under Russian protection.\n\n\nRussian expansionism\nRussia, as a member of the Holy Alliance, had operated as the \"police of Europe\" to maintain the balance of power that had been established in the Congress of Vienna in 1815 Russia had assisted Austria's efforts in suppressing the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, and expected a free hand in settling its problems with the Ottoman Empire, the \"sick man of Europe\" However, Britain could not tolerate Russian dominance of Ottoman affairs, which would challenge its domination of the eastern Mediterranean [21]\n\n\nImmediate causes of war\nFrench Emperor Napoleon III's ambition to restore France's grandeur [47] initiated the immediate chain of events that led to France and Britain declaring war on Russia on 27 and 28 March 1854, respectively He pursued Catholic support by asserting France's \"sovereign authority\" over the Christian population of Palestine, [48] to the detriment of Russia [49] (the sponsor of Eastern Orthodoxy) To achieve that, he in May 1851 appointed Charles, marquis de La Valette, a zealous leading member of the Catholic clericalists, as his ambassador to the Sublime Porte of the Ottoman Empire [50]\n\n\nFirst hostilities\nIn February 1853, the British government of Prime Minister Lord Aberdeen reappointed Lord Stratford as British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire [62] Having resigned the ambassadorship in January, he had been replaced by Colonel Rose as chargé d'affaires Lord Stratford then turned around, sailed back to Constantinople, arriving there on 5 April 1853 and convinced the Sultan there to reject the Russian treaty proposal as compromising Ottoman independence The Leader of the Opposition in the British House of Commons, Benjamin Disraeli, blamed Aberdeen and Stratford's actions for making war inevitable, which started the process that would force the Aberdeen government to resign in January 1855 over the war.\n\n\nBattle of Sinop\nThe European powers continued to pursue diplomatic avenues The representatives of the four Great Powers (the United Kingdom, France, Austria and Prussia) met in Vienna, where they drafted a note, which they hoped would be acceptable to both the Russians and the Ottomans The peace terms arrived at by the four powers at the Vienna Conference (1853) were delivered to the Russians by Austrian Foreign Minister Count Karl von Buol on 5 December 1853 The note met with the approval of Nicholas I, but Abdülmecid I rejected the proposal since he felt that the document's poor phrasing left it open to many different interpretations The United Kingdom, France and Austria united in proposing amendments to mollify the Sultan, but the court of St Petersburg ignored their suggestions [65] The United Kingdom and France then set aside the idea of continuing negotiations, but Austria and Prussia did not believe that the rejection of the proposed amendments justified the abandonment of the diplomatic process.\n\n\nDardanelles\nBritain was concerned about Russian activity and Sir John Burgoyne, a senior advisor to Lord Aberdeen, urged for the Dardanelles to be occupied and works of sufficient strength to be built to block any Russian move to capture Constantinople and gain access to the Mediterranean The Corps of Royal Engineers sent men to the Dardanelles, and Burgoyne went to Paris and met with the British ambassador and the French emperor Lord Cowley wrote on 8 February to Burgoyne, \"Your visit to Paris has produced a visible change in the Emperor's views, and he is making every preparation for a land expedition in case the last attempt at negotiation should break down\" [71]\n\n\nPeace attempts\nNicholas felt that because of Russian assistance in suppressing the Hungarian revolution of 1848, Austria would side with him or at the very least remain neutral Austria, however, felt threatened by the Russian troops in the Balkans On 27 February 1854, the United Kingdom and France demanded the withdrawal of Russian forces from the principalities Austria supported them and, without declaring war on Russia, refused to guarantee its neutrality Russia's rejection of the ultimatum proved to be the justification used by Britain and France to enter the war.\n\n\nBattles\nThe Danube campaign opened when the Russians occupied the Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia in July 1853, [76] which brought their forces to the north bank of the River Danube In response, the Ottoman Empire also moved its forces up to the river, establishing strongholds at Vidin in the west and Silistra [77] in the east, near the mouth of the Danube The Ottoman move up the River Danube was also of concern to the Austrians, who moved forces into Transylvania in response However, the Austrians had begun to fear the Russians more than the Ottomans Indeed, like the British, the Austrians were now coming to see that an intact Ottoman Empire was necessary as a bulwark against the Russians Accordingly, Austria resisted Russian diplomatic attempts to join the war but remained neutral during the Crimean War [78]\n\n\nDanube campaign\nThe Danube campaign opened when the Russians occupied the Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia in July 1853, [76] which brought their forces to the north bank of the River Danube In response, the Ottoman Empire also moved its forces up to the river, establishing strongholds at Vidin in the west and Silistra [77] in the east, near the mouth of the Danube The Ottoman move up the River Danube was also of concern to the Austrians, who moved forces into Transylvania in response However, the Austrians had begun to fear the Russians more than the Ottomans Indeed, like the British, the Austrians were now coming to see that an intact Ottoman Empire was necessary as a bulwark against the Russians Accordingly, Austria resisted Russian diplomatic attempts to join the war but remained neutral during the Crimean War [78]\n\n\nBlack Sea theatre\nThe naval operations of the Crimean War commenced with the dispatch in mid-1853 of the French and the British fleets to the Black Sea region, to support the Ottomans and to dissuade the Russians from encroachment By June 1853, both fleets had been stationed at Besikas Bay, outside the Dardanelles With the Russian occupation of the Danube Principalities in July 1853, they moved to the Bosphorus, and on 3 January 1854, they entered the Black Sea [7]\n\n\nCrimean campaign\nThe Russians evacuated Wallachia and Moldavia in late July 1854 Therefore, the immediate cause of war had now been withdrawn, and the war might have then ended [91] However, war fever among the public in both Britain and France had been whipped up by the press in both countries to the degree that politicians found it untenable to propose immediately ending the war The coalition government of George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen, fell on 30 January 1855 on a no-confidence vote, as Parliament voted to appoint a committee to investigate the mismanagement of the war [92]\n\n\nBattle of Balaclava\nA large Russian assault on the allied supply base to the southeast at Balaclava was rebuffed on 25 October 1854.: 521–527  The Battle of Balaclava is remembered in Britain for the actions of two British units At the start of the battle, a large body of Russian cavalry charged the 93rd Highlanders, who were posted north of the village of Kadikoi Commanding them was Sir Colin Campbell Rather than \"form square\", the traditional method of repelling cavalry, Campbell took the risky decision to have his Highlanders form a single line two men deep Campbell had seen the effectiveness of the new Minié rifles with which his troops were armed at the Battle of Alma, a month earlier, and he was confident that his men could beat back the Russians His tactics succeeded [102] From up on the ridge to the west, Times correspondent William Howard Russell saw the Highlanders as a \"thin red streak topped with steel\", a phrase which soon became the \"Thin Red Line\" [103]\n\n\nWinter of 1854–1855\nWinter weather and a deteriorating supply of troops and materiel on both sides led to a halt in ground operations Sevastopol remained invested by the allies, whose armies were hemmed in by the Imperial Russian Army in the interior On 14 November, the \"Balaklava Storm,\" a major weather event, sank 30 allied transport ships, [108] including HMS Prince, which was carrying a cargo of winter clothing [109]\n\n\nSiege of Sevastopol\nThe allies had had time to consider the problem, and the French were brought around to agree that the key to the defence was the Malakoff [115] Emphasis of the siege at Sevastopol shifted to the British left against the fortifications on Malakoff Hill [116] In March, there was fighting by the French over a new fort being built by the Russians at Mamelon, on a hill in front of the Malakoff Several weeks of fighting resulted in little change in the front line, and the Mamelon remained in Russian hands.\n\n\nAzov campaign\nIn early 1855, the allied Anglo-French commanders decided to send an Anglo-French naval squadron into the Azov Sea to undermine Russian communications and supplies to besieged Sevastopol On 12 May 1855, Anglo-French warships entered the Kerch Strait and destroyed the coast battery of the Kamishevaya Bay Once through the Kerch Strait, British and French warships struck at every vestige of Russian power along the coast of the Sea of Azov Except for Rostov and Azov, no town, depot, building or fortification was immune from attack, and Russian naval power ceased to exist almost overnight This Allied campaign led to a significant reduction in supplies flowing to the besieged Russian troops at Sevastopol.\n\n\nCaucasus theatre\nAs in the previous wars, the Caucasus front was secondary to what happened in the west Perhaps because of better communications, western events sometimes influenced the east The main events were the second capture of Kars and a landing on the Georgian coast Several commanders on both sides were either incompetent or unlucky, and few fought aggressively [127]\n\n\nBaltic theatre\nThe Baltic was a forgotten theatre of the Crimean War [129] Popularisation of events elsewhere overshadowed the significance of this theatre, which was close to Saint Petersburg, the Russian capital In April 1854, an Anglo-French fleet entered the Baltic to attack the Russian naval base of Kronstadt and the Russian fleet that was stationed there [130] In August 1854, the combined British and French fleet returned to Kronstadt for another attempt The outnumbered Russian Baltic Fleet confined its movements to the areas around its fortifications At the same time, the British and French commanders Sir Charles Napier and Alexandre Ferdinand Parseval-Deschenes although they led the largest fleet assembled since the Napoleonic Wars, considered the Sveaborg fortress too well-defended to engage Thus, shelling of the Russian batteries was limited to two attempts in 1854 and 1855, and initially, the attacking fleets limited their actions to blockading Russian trade in the Gulf of Finland [130] Naval attacks on other ports, such as the ones in the island of Hogland in the Gulf of Finland, proved more successful Additionally, allies conducted raids on less fortified sections of the Finnish coast [131] These battles are known in Finland as the Åland War.\n\n\nWhite Sea theatre\nIn late 1854, a squadron of three British warships led by HMS Miranda left the Baltic for the White Sea, where they shelled Kola (which was destroyed) [137] and the Solovki.\n\n\nPacific theatre\nMinor naval skirmishes also occurred in the Far East, where at Petropavlovsk on the Kamchatka Peninsula a British and French Allied squadron including HMS Pique under Rear Admiral David Price and a French force under Counter-Admiral Auguste Febvrier Despointes besieged a smaller Russian force under Rear Admiral Yevfimiy Putyatin In September 1854, an Allied landing force was beaten back with heavy casualties, and the Allies withdrew The victory at Petropavlovsk was for Russia in the words of the future Minister of War Dmitry Milyutin \"a ray of light among the dark clouds\" The Russians escaped under the cover of snow in early 1855 after Allied reinforcements arrived in the region.\n\n\nPiedmontese involvement\nCamillo di Cavour, under orders of Victor Emmanuel II of Piedmont-Sardinia, sent an expeditionary corps of 15,000 soldiers, commanded by General Alfonso La Marmora, to side with French and British forces during the war [139] This was an attempt at gaining the favour of the French, especially when the issue of uniting Italy would become an important matter The deployment of Italian troops to Crimea, and the gallantry shown by them in the Battle of the Chernaya (16 August 1855) and in the Siege of Sevastopol, allowed the Kingdom of Sardinia to be among the participants at the peace conference at the end of the war, where it could address the issue of the Risorgimento to other European powers.\n\n\nGreece\nGreece played a peripheral role in the war When Russia attacked the Ottoman Empire in 1853, King Otto of Greece saw an opportunity to expand north and south into Ottoman areas that had large Greek Christian majorities Greece did not coordinate its plans with Russia, did not declare war, and received no outside military or financial support Greece, an Orthodox nation, had considerable support in Russia, but the Russian government decided it was too dangerous to help Greece expand its holdings [140] When the Russians invaded the Principalities, the Ottoman forces were tied down so Greece invaded Thessaly and Epirus To block further Greek moves, the British and French occupied the main Greek port at Piraeus from April 1854 to February 1857, [141] and effectively neutralized the Greek Army The Greeks, gambling on a Russian victory, incited the large-scale Epirus Revolt of 1854 as well as uprisings in Ottoman Crete The insurrections were failures that were easily crushed by the Ottomans' allied Egyptian Army Greece was not invited to the peace conference and made no gains out of the war [142] [143] The frustrated Greek leadership blamed the King for failing to take advantage of the situation; his popularity plunged and he was forced to abdicate in 1862.\n\n\nKiev Cossack revolt\nA peasant revolt that began in the Vasylkiv county of Kiev Governorate (province) in February 1855 spread across the whole Kiev and Chernigov governorates, with peasants refusing to participate in corvée labour and other orders of the local authorities and, in some cases, attacking priests who were accused of hiding a decree about the liberation of the peasants [145] [better source needed]\n\n\nEnd of the war\nDissatisfaction with the conduct of the war was growing with the public in Britain and other countries and was worsened by reports of fiascos, especially the devastating losses of the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava On Sunday, 21 January 1855, a \"snowball riot\" occurred in Trafalgar Square near St Martin-in-the-Fields in which 1,500 people gathered to protest against the war by pelting cabs and pedestrians with snowballs [146] When the police intervened, the snowballs were directed at the constables The riot was finally put down by troops and police acting with truncheons [146] In Parliament, the Conservatives demanded an accounting of all soldiers, cavalry and sailors sent to Crimea and accurate figures as to the number of casualties sustained by all British armed forces in Crimea, especially concerning the Battle of Balaclava When Parliament passed a bill to investigate by the vote of 305 to 148, Aberdeen said he had lost a vote of no confidence and resigned as prime minister on 30 January 1855 [147] The veteran former Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston became prime minister [148] Palmerston took a hard line and wanted to expand the war, foment unrest inside the Russian Empire and reduce the Russian threat to Europe permanently Sweden–Norway and Prussia were willing to join Britain and France, and Russia was isolated [149]\n\n\nBritish position\nDissatisfaction with the

which had sent far more soldiers to the war and suffered far more casualties than Britain had, wanted the war to end, as did Austria [150]\n\n\nAftermath in Russia\nSome members of the Russian intelligentsia saw defeat as a pressure to modernise their society Grand Duke Constantine, a son of the Tsar, remarked: [157]\n\n\nLong-term effects\nOrlando Figes points to the long-term damage Russia suffered:\n\"The demilitarization of the Black Sea was a major blow to Russia, which was no longer able to protect its vulnerable southern coastal frontier against the British or any other fleet.. The destruction of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, Sevastopol and other naval docks was a humiliation No compulsory disarmament had ever been imposed on a great power previously.. The Allies did not really think that they were dealing with a European power in Russia They regarded Russia as a semi-Asiatic state.. In Russia itself, the Crimean defeat discredited the armed services and highlighted the need to modernize the country's defences, not just in the strictly military sense, but also through the building of railways, industrialization, sound finances and so on.. The image many Russians had built up of their country—the biggest, richest and most powerful in the world—had suddenly been shattered Russia's backwardness had been exposed.. The Crimean disaster had exposed the shortcomings of every institution in Russia—not just the corruption and incompetence of the military command, the technological backwardness of the army and navy, or the inadequate roads and lack of railways that accounted for the chronic problems of supply, but the poor condition and illiteracy of the serfs who made up the armed forces, the inability of the serf economy to sustain a state of war against industrial powers, and the failures of autocracy itself.\" [158]\n\n\nHistorical analysis\nAccording to historian Shepard Clough, the war\n\n\nDocumentation\nDocumentation of the war was provided by William Howard Russell, who wrote for The Times newspaper, and by Roger Fenton's photographs [175] News from war correspondents reached all of the nations involved in the war and kept the public citizenry of those nations better informed of the day-to-day events of the war than had been the case in any earlier war The British public was very well informed on the day-to-day realities of the war After the French extended the telegraph to the coast of the Black Sea in late 1854, news reached London in two days When the British laid an underwater cable to Crimea in April 1855, news reached London in a few hours The daily news reports energised public opinion, which brought down the Aberdeen government and carried Lord Palmerston into office as prime minister [176] [177]\n\n\nCriticisms and reform\nHistorian R B McCallum points out the war was enthusiastically supported by the British populace as it was happening, but the mood changed very dramatically afterwards Pacifists and critics were unpopular but:\n\n\nChronology of major battles of the war\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes and references\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nHistoriography and memory\n\n\nContemporary sources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Crimean War**\n\nThe Crimean War was a military conflict fought between Russia and an alliance of France, Britain, and the Ottoman Empire from 1853 to 1856. The war was sparked by Russia's expansionist policies in the region and its desire to gain control of the strategic Crimean Peninsula, which controlled access to the Black Sea.\n\n**Eastern Question**\n\nAs the Ottoman Empire steadily weakened during the 19th century, the Russian Empire stood poised to take advantage by expanding southward. In the 1850s, the British and the French Empires were allied with the Ottoman Empire and were determined to prevent that from happening. The historian A J P Taylor argued that the war had resulted not from aggression, but from the interacting fears of the major players.\n\n**Weakening of the Ottoman Empire: 1820–1840s**\n\nIn the early 1800s, the Ottoman Empire suffered a number of existential challenges. The Serbian Revolution in 1804 resulted in the autonomy of the first Balkan Christian nation under the empire. The Greek War of Independence, which began in early 1821, provided further evidence of the empire's internal and military weakness, and the commission of atrocities by Ottoman military forces (see Chios massacre) further undermined the empire. The disbandment of the centuries-old Janissary corps by Sultan Mahmud II on 15 June 1826 (Auspicious Incident) helped the empire in the longer term but deprived it of its existing standing army in the short term. In 1827, the Anglo-Franco-Russian fleet destroyed almost all of the Ottoman naval forces at the Battle of Navarino. In 1830, Greece became independent after ten years of war and the Russo-Turkish War (1828–29) The Treaty of Adrianople (1829) granted Russian and Western European commercial ships free passage through the Black Sea straits. Also, Serbia received autonomy, and the Danubian Principalities (Moldavia and Wallachia) became territories under Russian protection.\n\n**Russian Expansionism**\n\nRussia, as a member of the Holy Alliance, had operated as the \"police of Europe\" to maintain the balance of power that had been established in the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Russia had assisted Austria's efforts in suppressing the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, and expected a free hand in settling its problems with the Ottoman Empire, the \"sick man of Europe\". However, Britain could not tolerate Russian dominance of Ottoman affairs, which would challenge its domination of the eastern Mediterranean.\n\n**Immediate Causes of War**\n\nFrench Emperor Napoleon III's ambition to restore France's grandeur initiated the immediate chain of events that led to France and Britain declaring war on Russia on 27 and 28 March 1854, respectively. He pursued Catholic support by asserting France's \"sovereign authority\" over the Christian population of Palestine, to the detriment of Russia (the sponsor of Eastern Orthodoxy). To achieve that, he in May 1851 appointed Charles, marquis de La Valette, a zealous leading member of the Catholic clericalists, as his ambassador to the Sublime Porte of the Ottoman Empire.\n\n**First Hostilities**\n\nIn February 1853, the British government of Prime Minister Lord Aberdeen reappointed Lord Stratford as British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. Having resigned the ambassadorship in January, he had been replaced by Colonel Rose as chargé d'affaires. Lord Stratford then turned around, sailed back to Constantinople, arriving there on 5 April 1853 and convinced the Sultan there to reject the Russian treaty proposal as compromising Ottoman independence. The Leader of the Opposition in the British House of Commons, Benjamin Disraeli, blamed Aberdeen and Stratford's actions for making war inevitable, which started the process that would force the Aberdeen government to resign in January 1855 over the war.\n\n**Battle of Sinop**\n\nThe European powers continued to pursue diplomatic avenues. The representatives of the four Great Powers (the United Kingdom, France, Austria and Prussia) met in Vienna, where they drafted a note, which they hoped would be acceptable to both the Russians and the Ottomans. The peace terms arrived at by the four powers at the Vienna Conference (1853) were delivered to the Russians by Austrian Foreign Minister Count Karl von Buol on 5 December 1853 The note met with the approval of Nicholas I, but Abdülmecid I rejected the proposal since he felt that the document's poor phrasing left it open to many different interpretations. The United Kingdom, France and Austria united in proposing amendments to mollify the Sultan, but the court of St Petersburg ignored their suggestions. The United Kingdom and France then set aside the idea of continuing negotiations, but Austria and Prussia did not believe that the rejection of the proposed amendments justified the abandonment of the diplomatic process.\n\n**Dardanelles**\n\nBritain was concerned about Russian activity and Sir John Burgoyne, a senior advisor to Lord Aberdeen, urged for the Dardanelles to be occupied and works of sufficient strength to be built to block any Russian move to capture Constantinople and gain access to the Mediterranean. The Corps of Royal Engineers sent men to the Dardanelles, and Burgoyne went to Paris and met with the British ambassador and the French emperor. Lord Cowley wrote on 8 February to Burgoyne, \"Your visit to Paris has produced a visible change in the Emperor's views, and he is making every preparation for a land expedition in case the last attempt at negotiation should break down\".\n\n**Peace Attempts**\n\nNicholas felt that because of Russian assistance in suppressing the Hungarian revolution of 1848, Austria would side with him or at the very least remain neutral. Austria, however, felt threatened by the Russian troops in the Balkans. On 27 February 1854, the United Kingdom and France demanded the withdrawal of Russian forces from the principalities. Austria supported them and, without declaring war on Russia, refused to guarantee its neutrality. Russia's rejection of the ultimatum proved to be the justification used by Britain and France to enter the war.\n\n**Battles**\n\nThe Danube campaign opened when the Russians occupied the Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia in July 1853, which brought their forces to the north bank of the River Danube. In response, the Ottoman Empire also moved its forces up to the river, establishing strongholds at Vidin in the west and Silistra in the east, near the mouth of the Danube. The Ottoman move up the River Danube was also of concern to the Austrians, who moved forces into Transylvania in response. However, the Austrians had begun to fear the Russians more than the Ottomans. Indeed, like the British, the Austrians were now coming to see that an intact Ottoman Empire was necessary as a bulwark against the Russians. Accordingly, Austria resisted Russian diplomatic attempts to join the war but remained neutral during the Crimean War.\n\n**Black Sea Theatre**\n\nThe naval operations of the Crimean War commenced with the dispatch in mid-1853 of the French and the British fleets to the Black Sea region, to support the Ottomans and to dissuade the Russians from encroachment. By June 1853, both fleets had been stationed at Besikas Bay, outside the Dardanelles. With the Russian occupation of the Danube Principalities in July 1853, they moved to the Bosphorus, and on 3 January 1854, they entered the Black Sea.\n\n**Crimean Campaign**\n\nThe Russians evacuated Wallachia and Moldavia in late July 1854. Therefore, the immediate cause of war had now been withdrawn, and the war might have then ended. However, war fever among the public in both Britain and France had been whipped up by the press in both countries to the degree that politicians found it untenable to propose immediately ending the war. The coalition government of George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen, fell on 30 January 1855 on a no-confidence vote, as Parliament voted to appoint a committee to investigate the mismanagement of the war.\n\n**Battle of Balaclava**\n\nA large Russian assault on the allied supply base to the southeast at Balaclava was rebuffed on 25 October 1854. The Battle of Balaclava is remembered in Britain for the actions of two British units. At the start of the battle, a large body of Russian cavalry charged the 93rd Highlanders, who were posted north of the village of Kadikoi. Commanding them was Sir Colin Campbell. Rather than \"form square\", the traditional method of repelling cavalry, Campbell took the risky decision to have his Highlanders form a single line two men deep. Campbell had seen the effectiveness of the new Minié rifles with which his troops were armed at the Battle of Alma, a month earlier, and he was confident that his men could beat back the Russians. His tactics succeeded.\n\n**Winter of 1854–1855**\n\nWinter weather and a deteriorating supply of troops and materiel on both sides led to a halt in ground operations. Sevastopol remained invested by the allies, whose armies were hemmed in by the Imperial Russian Army in the interior. On 14 November, the \"Balaklava Storm,\" a major weather event, sank 30 allied transport ships, including HMS Prince, which was carrying a cargo of winter clothing.\n\n**Siege of Sevastopol**\n\nThe allies had had time to consider the problem, and the French were brought around to agree that the key to the defence was the Malakoff. Emphasis of the siege at Sevastopol shifted to the British left against the fortifications on Malakoff Hill. In March, there was fighting by the French over a new fort being built by the Russians at Mamelon, on a hill in front of the Malakoff. Several weeks of fighting resulted in little change in the front line, and the Mamelon remained in Russian hands.\n\n**Azov Campaign**\n\nIn early 1855, the allied Anglo-French commanders decided to send an Anglo-French naval squadron into the Azov Sea to undermine Russian communications and supplies to besieged Sevastopol. On 12 May 1855, Anglo-French warships entered the Kerch Strait and destroyed the coast battery of the Kamishevaya Bay. Once through the Kerch Strait, British and French warships struck at every vestige of Russian power along the coast of the Sea of Azov. Except for Rostov and Azov, no town, depot, building or fortification was immune from attack, and Russian naval power ceased to exist almost overnight.\n\n**Caucasus Theatre**\n\nAs in the previous wars, the Caucasus front was secondary to what happened in the west. Perhaps because of better communications, western events sometimes influenced the east. The main events were the second capture of Kars and a landing on the Georgian coast. Several commanders on both sides were either incompetent or unlucky, and few fought aggressively.\n\n**Baltic Theatre**\n\nThe Baltic was a forgotten theatre of the Crimean War. Popularisation of events elsewhere overshadowed the significance of this theatre, which was close to Saint Petersburg, the Russian capital. In April 1854, an Anglo-French fleet entered the Baltic to attack the Russian naval base of Kronstadt and the Russian fleet that was stationed there. In August 1854, the combined British and French fleet returned to Kronstadt for another attempt. The outnumbered Russian Baltic Fleet confined its movements to the areas around its fortifications. At the same time, the British and French commanders Sir Charles Napier and Alexandre Ferdinand Parseval-Deschenes, although they led the largest fleet assembled since the Napoleonic Wars, considered the Sveaborg fortress too well-defended to engage. Thus, shelling of the Russian batteries was limited to two attempts in 1854 and 1855, and initially, the attacking fleets limited their actions to blockading Russian trade in the Gulf of Finland. Naval attacks on other ports, such as the ones in the island of Hogland in the Gulf of Finland, proved more successful. Additionally, allies conducted raids on less fortified sections of the Finnish coast. These battles are known in Finland as the Åland War.\n\n**White Sea Theatre**\n\nIn late 1854, a squadron of three British warships led by HMS Miranda left the Baltic for the White Sea, where they shelled Kola (which was destroyed) and the Solovki.\n\n**Pacific Theatre**\n\nMinor naval skirmishes also occurred in the Far East, where at Petropavlovsk on the Kamchatka Peninsula a British and French Allied squadron including HMS Pique under Rear Admiral David Price and a French force under Counter-Admiral Auguste Febvrier Despointes besieged a smaller Russian force under Rear Admiral Yevfimiy Putyatin. In September 1854, an Allied landing force was beaten back with heavy casualties, and the Allies withdrew. The victory at Petropavlovsk was for Russia in the words of the future Minister of War Dmitry Milyutin \"a ray of light among the dark clouds\". The Russians escaped under the cover of snow in early 1855 after Allied reinforcements arrived in the region.\n\n**Piedmontese Involvement**\n\nCamillo di Cavour, under orders of Victor Emmanuel II of Piedmont-Sardinia, sent an expeditionary corps of 15,000 soldiers, commanded by General Alfonso La Marmora, to side with French and British forces during the war. This was an attempt at gaining the favour of the French, especially when the issue of uniting Italy would become an important matter. The deployment of Italian troops to Crimea, and the gallantry shown by them in the Battle of the Chernaya (16 August 1855) and in the Siege of Sevastopol, allowed the Kingdom of Sardinia to be among the participants at the peace conference at the end of the war, where it could address the issue of the Risorgimento to other European powers.\n\n**Greece**\n\nGreece played a peripheral role in the war. When Russia attacked the Ottoman Empire in 1853, King Otto of Greece saw an opportunity to expand north and south into Ottoman areas that had large Greek Christian majorities. Greece did not coordinate its plans with Russia, did not declare war, and received no outside military or financial support. Greece, an Orthodox nation, had considerable support in Russia, but the Russian government decided it was too dangerous to help Greece expand its holdings. When the Russians invaded the Principalities, the Ottoman forces were tied down so Greece invaded Thessaly and Epirus. To block further Greek moves, the British and French occupied the main Greek port at Piraeus from April 1854 to February 1857, and effectively neutralized the Greek Army. The Greeks, gambling on a Russian victory, incited the large-scale Epirus Revolt of 1854 as well as uprisings in Ottoman Crete. The insurrections were failures that were easily crushed by the Ottomans' allied Egyptian Army. Greece was not invited to the peace conference and made no gains out of the war. The frustrated Greek leadership blamed the King for failing to take advantage of the situation; his popularity plunged and he was forced to abdicate in 1862.\n\n**Kiev Cossack Revolt**\n\nA peasant revolt that began in the Vasylkiv county of Kiev Governorate (province) in February 1855 spread across the whole Kiev and Chernigov governorates, with peasants refusing to participate in corvée labour and other orders of the local authorities and, in some cases, attacking priests who were accused of hiding a decree about the liberation of the peasants.\n\n**End of the War**\n\nDissatisfaction with the conduct of the war was growing with the public in Britain and other countries and was worsened by reports of fiascos, especially the devastating losses of the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava. On Sunday, 21 January 1855, a \"snowball riot\" occurred in Trafalgar Square near St Martin-in-the-Fields in which 1,500 people gathered to protest against the war by pelting cabs and pedestrians with snowballs. When the police intervened, the snowballs were directed at the constables. The riot was finally put down by troops and police acting with truncheons. In Parliament, the Conservatives demanded an accounting of all soldiers, cavalry and sailors sent to Crimea and accurate figures as to the number of casualties sustained by all British armed forces in Crimea, especially concerning the Battle of Balaclava. When Parliament passed a bill to investigate by the vote of 305 to 148, Aberdeen said he had lost a vote of no confidence and resigned as prime minister on 30 January 1855. The veteran former Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston became prime minister. Palmerston took a hard line and wanted to expand the war, foment unrest inside the Russian Empire and reduce the Russian threat to Europe permanently. Sweden–Norway and Prussia were willing to join Britain and France, and Russia was isolated.\n\n**Aftermath in Russia**\n\nSome members of the Russian intelligentsia saw defeat as a pressure to modernise their society. Grand Duke Constantine, a son of the Tsar, remarked: \"We are no longer the invincible army of Peter the Great... We have been vanquished by a power that, though more modern, is not more powerful than ourselves.\"\n\n**Long-term Effects**\n\nOrlando Figes points to the long-term damage Russia suffered: \"The demilitarization of the Black Sea was a major blow to Russia, which was no longer able to protect its vulnerable southern coastal frontier against the British or any other fleet... The destruction of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, Sevastopol and other naval docks was a humiliation... No compulsory disarmament had ever been imposed on a great power previously...

News from war correspondents reached all of the nations involved in the war and kept the public citizenry of those nations better informed of the day-to-day events of the war than had been the case in any earlier war. The British public was very well informed on the day-to-day realities of the war. After the French extended the telegraph to the coast of the Black Sea in late 1854, news reached London in two days.

revolution of 1848, Austria would side with him or at the very least remain neutral Austria, however, felt threatened by the Russian troops in the Balkans On 27 February 1854, the United Kingdom and France demanded the withdrawal of Russian forces from the principalities Austria supported them and, without declaring war on Russia, refused to guarantee its neutrality Russia's rejection of the ultimatum proved to be the justification used by Britain and France to enter the war.\n\n\nBattles\nThe Danube campaign opened when the Russians occupied the Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia in July 1853, [76] which brought their forces to the north bank of the River Danube In response, the Ottoman Empire also moved its forces up to the river, establishing strongholds at Vidin in the west and Silistra [77] in the east, near the mouth of the Danube The Ottoman move up the River Danube was also of concern to the Austrians, who moved forces into Transylvania in response However, the Austrians had begun to fear the Russians more than the Ottomans Indeed, like the British, the Austrians were now coming to see that an intact Ottoman Empire was necessary as a bulwark against the Russians Accordingly, Austria resisted Russian diplomatic attempts to join the war but remained neutral during the Crimean War [78]\n\n\nDanube campaign\nThe Danube campaign opened when the Russians occupied the Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia in July 1853, [76] which brought their forces to the north bank of the River Danube In response, the Ottoman Empire also moved its forces up to the river, establishing strongholds at Vidin in the west and Silistra [77] in the east, near the mouth of the Danube The Ottoman move up the River Danube was also of concern to

see that an intact Ottoman Empire was necessary as a bulwark against the Russians Accordingly, Austria resisted Russian diplomatic attempts to join the war but remained neutral during the Crimean War [78]\n\n\nBlack Sea theatre\nThe naval operations of the Crimean War commenced with the dispatch in mid-1853 of the French and the British fleets to the Black Sea region, to support the Ottomans and to dissuade the Russians from encroachment By June 1853, both fleets had been stationed at Besikas Bay, outside the Dardanelles With the Russian occupation of the Danube Principalities in July 1853, they moved to the Bosphorus, and on 3 January 1854, they entered the Black Sea [7]\n\n\nCrimean campaign\nThe Russians evacuated Wallachia and Moldavia in late July 1854 Therefore, the immediate cause of war had now been withdrawn, and the war might have then ended [91] However, war fever among the public in both Britain and France had been whipped up by the press in both countries to the degree that politicians found it untenable to propose immediately ending the war The coalition government of George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen, fell on 30 January 1855 on a no-confidence vote, as Parliament voted to appoint a committee to investigate the mismanagement of the war [92]\n\n\nBattle of Balaclava\nA large Russian assault on the allied supply base to the southeast at Balaclava was rebuffed on 25 October 1854.: 521–527  The Battle of Balaclava is remembered in Britain for the actions of two British units At the start of the battle, a large body of Russian cavalry charged the 93rd Highlanders, who were posted north of the village of Kadikoi Commanding them was Sir Colin Campbell Rather than \"form square\", the traditional method of repelling cavalry, Campbell took the risky decision to have his Highlanders form a single line two men deep Campbell had seen the effectiveness of the new Minié rifles with which his troops were armed at the Battle of Alma, a month earlier, and he was confident that his men could beat back the Russians His tactics succeeded [102] From up on the ridge to the west, Times correspondent William Howard Russell saw the Highlanders as a \"thin red streak topped with steel\", a phrase which soon became the \"Thin Red Line\" [103]\n\n\nWinter of 1854–1855\nWinter weather and a deteriorating supply of troops and materiel on both sides led to a halt in ground operations Sevastopol remained invested by the allies, whose armies were hemmed in by the Imperial Russian Army in the interior On 14 November, the \"Balaklava Storm,\" a major weather event, sank 30 allied transport ships, [108] including HMS Prince, which was carrying a cargo of winter clothing [109]\n\n\nSiege of Sevastopol\nThe allies had had time to consider the problem, and the French were brought around to agree that the key to the defence was the Malakoff [115] Emphasis of the siege at Sevastopol shifted to the British left against the fortifications on Malakoff Hill [116] In March, there was fighting by the French over a new fort being built by the Russians at Mamelon, on a hill in front of the Malakoff Several weeks of fighting resulted in little change in the front line, and the Mamelon remained in Russian hands.\n\n\nAzov campaign\nIn early 1855, the allied Anglo-French commanders decided to send an Anglo-French naval squadron into the Azov Sea to undermine Russian communications and supplies to besieged Sevastopol On 12 May 1855, Anglo-French warships entered the Kerch Strait and destroyed the coast battery of the Kamishevaya Bay Once through the Kerch Strait, British and French warships struck at every vestige of Russian power along the coast of the Sea of Azov Except for Rostov and Azov, no town, depot, building or fortification was immune from attack, and Russian naval power ceased to exist almost overnight This Allied campaign led to a significant reduction in supplies flowing to the besieged Russian troops at Sevastopol.\n\n\nCaucasus theatre\nAs in the previous wars, the Caucasus front was secondary to what happened in the west Perhaps because of better communications, western events sometimes influenced the east The main events were the second capture of Kars and a landing on the Georgian coast Several commanders on both sides were either incompetent or unlucky, and few fought aggressively [127]\n\n\nBaltic theatre\nThe Baltic was a forgotten theatre of the Crimean War [129] Popularisation of events elsewhere overshadowed the significance of this theatre, which was close to Saint Petersburg, the Russian capital In April 1854, an Anglo-French fleet entered the Baltic to attack the Russian naval base of Kronstadt and the Russian fleet that was stationed there [130] In August 1854, the combined British and French fleet returned to Kronstadt for another attempt The outnumbered Russian Baltic Fleet confined its movements to the areas around its fortifications At the same time, the British and French commanders Sir Charles Napier and Alexandre Ferdinand Parseval-Deschenes although they led the largest fleet assembled since the Napoleonic Wars, considered the Sveaborg fortress too well-defended to engage Thus, shelling of the Russian batteries was limited to two attempts in 1854 and 1855, and initially, the attacking fleets limited their actions to blockading Russian trade in the Gulf of Finland [130] Naval attacks on other ports, such as the ones in the island of Hogland in the Gulf of Finland, proved more successful Additionally, allies conducted raids on less fortified sections of the Finnish coast [131] These battles are known in Finland as the Åland War.\n\n\nWhite Sea theatre\nIn late 1854, a squadron of three British warships led by HMS Miranda left the Baltic for the White Sea, where they shelled Kola (which was destroyed) [137] and the Solovki.\n\n\nPacific theatre\nMinor naval skirmishes also occurred in the Far East, where at Petropavlovsk on the Kamchatka Peninsula a British and French Allied squadron including HMS Pique under Rear Admiral David Price and a French force under Counter-Admiral Auguste Febvrier Despointes besieged a smaller Russian force under Rear Admiral Yevfimiy Putyatin In September 1854, an Allied landing force was beaten back with heavy casualties, and the Allies withdrew The victory at Petropavlovsk was for Russia in the words of the future Minister of War Dmitry Milyutin \"a ray of light among the dark clouds\" The Russians escaped under the cover of snow in early 1855 after Allied reinforcements arrived in the region.\n\n\nPiedmontese involvement\nCamillo di Cavour, under orders of Victor Emmanuel II of Piedmont-Sardinia, sent an expeditionary corps of 15,000 soldiers, commanded by General Alfonso La Marmora, to side with French and British forces during the war [139] This was an attempt at gaining the favour of the French, especially when the issue of uniting Italy would become an important matter The deployment of Italian troops to Crimea, and the gallantry shown by them in the Battle of the Chernaya (16 August 1855) and in the Siege of Sevastopol, allowed the Kingdom of Sardinia to be among the participants at the peace conference at the end of the war, where it could address the issue of the Risorgimento to other European powers.\n\n\nGreece\nGreece played a peripheral role in the war When Russia attacked the Ottoman Empire in 1853, King Otto of Greece saw an opportunity to expand north and south into Ottoman areas that had large Greek Christian majorities Greece did not coordinate its plans with Russia, did not declare war, and received no outside military or financial support Greece, an Orthodox nation, had considerable support in Russia, but the Russian government decided it was too dangerous to help Greece expand its holdings [140] When the Russians invaded the Principalities, the Ottoman forces were tied down so Greece invaded Thessaly and Epirus To block further Greek moves, the British and French occupied the main Greek port at Piraeus from April 1854 to February 1857, [141] and effectively neutralized the Greek Army The Greeks, gambling on a Russian victory, incited the large-scale Epirus Revolt of 1854 as well as uprisings in Ottoman Crete The insurrections were failures that were easily crushed by the Ottomans' allied Egyptian Army Greece was not invited to the peace conference and made no gains out of the war [142] [143] The frustrated Greek leadership blamed the King for failing to take advantage of the situation; his popularity plunged and he was forced to abdicate in 1862.\n\n\nKiev Cossack revolt\nA peasant revolt that began in the Vasylkiv county of Kiev Governorate (province) in February 1855 spread across the whole Kiev and Chernigov governorates, with peasants refusing to participate in corvée labour and other orders of the local authorities and, in some cases, attacking priests who were accused of hiding a decree about the liberation of the peasants [145] [better source needed]\n\n\nEnd of the war\nDissatisfaction with the conduct of the war was growing with the public in Britain and other countries and was worsened by reports of fiascos, especially the devastating losses of the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava On Sunday, 21 January 1855, a \"snowball riot\" occurred in Trafalgar Square near St Martin-in-the-Fields in which 1,500 people gathered to protest against the war by pelting cabs and pedestrians with snowballs [146] When the police intervened, the snowballs were directed at the constables The riot was finally put down by troops and police acting with truncheons [146] In Parliament, the Conservatives demanded an accounting of all soldiers, cavalry and sailors sent to Crimea and accurate figures as to the number of casualties sustained by all British armed forces in Crimea, especially concerning the Battle of Balaclava When Parliament passed a bill to investigate by the vote of 305 to 148, Aberdeen said he had lost a vote of no confidence and resigned as prime minister on 30 January 1855 [147] The veteran former Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston became prime minister [148] Palmerston took a hard line and wanted to expand the war, foment unrest inside the Russian Empire and reduce the Russian threat to Europe permanently Sweden–Norway and Prussia were willing to join Britain and France, and Russia was isolated [149]\n\n\nBritish position\nDissatisfaction with the conduct of the war was growing with the public in Britain and other countries and was worsened by reports of fiascos, especially the devastating losses of the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava On Sunday, 21 January 1855, a

permanently Sweden–Norway and Prussia were willing to join Britain and France, and Russia was isolated [149]\n\n\nPeace negotiations\nFrance, which had sent far more soldiers to the war and suffered far more casualties than Britain had, wanted the war to end, as did Austria [150]\n\n\nAftermath in Russia\nSome members of the Russian intelligentsia saw defeat as a pressure to modernise their society Grand Duke Constantine, a son of the Tsar, remarked: [157]\n\n\nLong-term effects\nOrlando Figes points to the long-term damage Russia suffered:\n\"The demilitarization of the Black Sea was a major blow to Russia, which was no longer able to protect its vulnerable southern coastal frontier against the British or any other fleet.. The destruction of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, Sevastopol and other naval docks was a humiliation No compulsory disarmament had ever been imposed on a great power previously.. The Allies did not really think that they were dealing with a European power in Russia They regarded Russia as a semi-Asiatic state.. In Russia itself, the Crimean defeat discredited the armed services and highlighted the need to modernize the country's defences, not just in the strictly military sense, but also through the building of railways, industrialization, sound finances and so on.. The image many Russians had built up of their country—the biggest, richest and most powerful in the world—had suddenly been shattered Russia's backwardness had been exposed.. The Crimean disaster had exposed the shortcomings of every institution in Russia—not just the corruption and incompetence of the military command, the technological backwardness of the army and navy, or the inadequate roads and lack of railways that accounted for the chronic problems of supply, but the poor condition and illiteracy of the serfs who made up the armed forces, the inability of the serf economy to sustain a state of war against industrial powers, and the failures of autocracy itself.\" [158]\n\n\nHistorical analysis\nAccording to historian Shepard Clough, the war\n\n\nDocumentation\nDocumentation of the war was provided by William Howard Russell, who wrote for The Times newspaper, and by Roger Fenton's photographs [175] News from war correspondents reached all of the nations involved in the war and kept the public citizenry of those nations better informed of the day-to-day events of the war than had been the case in any earlier war The British public was very well informed on the day-to-day realities of the war After the French extended the telegraph to the coast of the Black Sea in late 1854, news reached London in two days When the British laid an underwater cable to Crimea in April 1855, news reached London in a few hours The daily news reports energised public opinion, which brought down the Aberdeen government and carried Lord Palmerston into office as prime minister [176] [177]\n\n\nCriticisms and reform\nHistorian R B McCallum points out the war was enthusiastically supported by the British populace as it was happening, but the mood changed very dramatically afterwards Pacifists and critics were unpopular but:\n\n\nChronology of major battles of the war\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes and references\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nHistoriography and memory\n\n\nContemporary sources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The public wouldn't know the difference\" Maguire's girlfriend's father Ronald Meyer—head of Universal Studios—helped Maguire regain the role, with a salary of $17 million [54] [55] Maguire underwent tests to make sure if his back was fit for filming [56] Gyllenhaal would later say in a 2019 interview saying that he was one of several actors considered to replace Maguire [57] Raimi stated that prior to filming he was concerned that Maguire and Dunst weren't going to have the same chemistry, as they had since broken up [58]\n\n\nFilming\nSpider-Man 2 was shot on over one hundred sets and locations, beginning with a pre-shoot on the Loop in Chicago during two days in November 2002 The crew acquired a train of 2200 series cars, placing sixteen cameras for background shots of Spider-Man and Doc Ock's train fight [40] [65] Filming was originally slated to start in January 2003, but was pushed back to April so that Maguire could finish Seabiscuit [66] [67] Principal photography began on April 12, 2003, in New York City and Chicago The crew moved on May 13 to Los Angeles, [42] shooting on sets created by production designer Neil Spisak [68] After the scare surrounding his back pains, Tobey Maguire relished performing many of his stunts, even creating a joke of it with Raimi, creating the line \"My back, my back\" as Spider-Man tries to regain his powers [49] Raimi said that while filming the scene he yelled at Maguire to get to the edge of the building, but Maguire refused to do it [69] Even Rosemary Harris took a turn, putting her stunt double out of work In contrast, Alfred Molina joked that the stunt team would \"trick\" him into performing a stunt time and again [40] J K Simmons said that while filming the scene where Spider-Man gets his suit back from The Daily Bugle, when Simmons said \"he's a thief\" his fake-teeth popped out of his mouth [70]\n\n\nVisual effects\nAlthough roughly the same as before, costume designer James Acheson made numerous subtle changes to Spider-Man's costume Its colors were made richer and bolder, its spider emblem was given more elegant lines and enlarged, its eye-lenses were somewhat smaller, and its muscle suit underneath was made into pieces, to give a better sense of movement The helmet Maguire wore under his mask was also improved, with better movement for the false jaw and magnetic eyepieces, which were easier to remove [40]\n\n\nMusic\nThe film was scored by Danny Elfman, composer of the previous film However, during recording sessions, Elfman had a falling out with director Sam Raimi, saying that composing Spider-Man 2 was a \"miserable experience\" [79] Christopher Young (who eventually scored the sequel), Joseph LoDuca, and John Debney did additional scores for the film [80] [81] They wanted Elfman to do one cue that was from Hellraiser, but he couldn't get it close to it and he wasn't going imitate Christopher Young, he instead suggested to hire Young, but Young also couldn't get it close either, so they instead licensed the cue from Hellraiser [82]\n\n\nRelease\nThe first teaser trailer was released in December 2003, being attached to the screenings of The Lord of the Rings: The

Its colors were made richer and bolder, its spider emblem was given more elegant lines and enlarged, its eye-lenses were somewhat smaller, and its muscle suit underneath was made into pieces, to give a better sense of movement.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe film was scored by Danny Elfman, composer of the previous film. However, during recording sessions, Elfman had a falling out with director Sam Raimi, saying that composing Spider-Man 2 was a \"miserable experience.\" Christopher Young, Joseph LoDuca, and John Debney did additional scores for the film.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe first teaser trailer was released in December 2003, being attached to the screenings of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.

The film was also nominated for Best Sound Mixing and Best Sound Editing.\n\n**Future**\n\nIn March 2004, three months before Spider-Man 2's release, Sony announced that a sequel was already in development. Spider-Man 3 was released on May 4, 2007.\n\n**Video Game**\n\nTo coincide with the film's release, a video game of the same name was released for the Game Boy Advance, GameCube, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, and Xbox on June 28, 2004.

{"title": "War_in_Afghanistan_(2001–present)", "content": "\nNames\nThis twenty-year armed conflict (2001–2021) is referred to as the War in Afghanistan [95] in order to distinguish it from the country's various other wars, [96] notably the ongoing Afghan conflict of which it was a part, [97] and the Soviet–Afghan War [98] [full citation needed] From the perspective of the West, the war is divided between 2001 and 2014 (the ISAF mission), when most combat operations were performed by coalition forces, a 2015 to 2021 (the Resolute Support Mission), when the Afghan armed forces did most of the fighting against the Taliban [citation needed] The war was named Operation Enduring Freedom from 2001 to 2014 [99] and as Operation Freedom's Sentinel from 2015 to 2021 by the US [100] Alternatively, it has been called the US War in Afghanistan [101] [102] [103] In Afghanistan itself, the war is known as simply the \"War in Afghanistan\" (Dari: جنگ در افغانستان Jang dar Afghanistan, Pashto: د افغانستان جګړه Da Afghanistan Jagra) [104] [105] [106]\n\n\nPrelude\nThe Taliban emerged from religious students known as the Talib who sought to end warlordism in Afghanistan through stricter adherence to Sharia [107] [108] On 27 September 1996, the Taliban, with military support by Pakistan and financial support from Saudi Arabia, seized Kabul and founded the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan [109] The Taliban imposed their fundamentalist Deobandi interpretation of Islam in areas under their control, issuing edicts forbidding women to work outside the home, attend school or to leave their homes unless accompanied by a male relative [110] According to the United Nations (UN), the Taliban, while trying to consolidate control over northern and western Afghanistan, committed systematic massacres against civilians UN officials stated that there had been \"15 massacres\" between 1996 and 2001, many of them targeting Shias and Hazaras [111] [112]\n\n\nRise of the

there had been \"15 massacres\" between 1996 and 2001, many of them targeting Shias and Hazaras [111] [112]\n\n\nAl-Qaeda\nThe 9/11 Commission in the US found that under the Taliban, Al-Qaeda was able to use Afghanistan as a place to train and teach fighters, import weapons, coordinate with other jihadists, and plot terrorist actions [117] While Al-Qaeda maintained its own camps in Afghanistan, it also supported training camps of other organizations An estimated 10,000 to 20,000 men passed through these facilities before 9/11, most of whom were sent to fight for the Taliban against the United Front A smaller number were inducted into Al-Qaeda [118]\n\n\nSeptember 11 attacks\nOn the morning of Tuesday, September 11, 2001, a total of 19 men affiliated with Al-Qaeda carried out four coordinated attacks in the United States Four commercial passenger jet airliners were hijacked [120] [121] The hijackers intentionally crashed two of the airliners into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, killing everyone on board and more than 2,000 people in the buildings Both buildings collapsed within two hours from damage related to the crashes, destroying and damaging nearby buildings The hijackers crashed a third airliner into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C The fourth plane crashed into a field near Shanksville, in rural Pennsylvania, after some of its passengers and flight crew attempted to retake control of the plane, which the hijackers had redirected toward Washington, D.C., to target the White House, or the US Capitol No one aboard the flights survived The death toll among responders including firefighters and police was 836 as of 2009 [122] Total deaths were 2,996, including the 19 hijackers [122]\n\n\nUS ultimatum to the Taliban\nImmediately after the 9/11 attacks, the United States National Security Council agreed that military action would probably have to be taken against Al-Qaeda and the Taliban However, Bush decided to issue an ultimatum to the Taliban first, [123]: 54  demanding that the Taliban hand over Osama bin Laden, \"close immediately every terrorist training camp, hand over every terrorist and their supporters, and give the United States full access to terrorist training camps for inspection.\" [124] The same day, religious scholars met in Kabul, deciding that bin Laden should be surrendered; however, Mullah Omar decided that \"turning over Osama would only be a disgrace for us and Islamic thought and belief would be a weakness\", and that the US would continue making demands after surrendering bin Laden, who he claimed was innocent [123]: 56  The Taliban refused the ultimatum, saying that Osama bin Laden was protected by the traditional Pashtun laws of hospitality [125] [126]\n\n\nHistory\nThe war contained two main factions: the Coalition, which included the US and its allies (eventually supporting the government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan), fighting against the Taliban, its allies, and its militias Complicating the fight were Taliban splinter groups and other, more radical religious groups such as al-Qaeda and later the Islamic State These radical groups sometimes fought for the Taliban, sometimes fought for their own goals, and sometimes fought against both the Taliban and the government.\n\n\nTactical overview\nThe war contained

Taliban, sometimes fought for their own goals, and sometimes fought against both the Taliban and the government.\n\n\n2001: Invasion and early operations\nThough the US officially invaded on 7 October 2001 by launching Operation Enduring Freedom, covert operations had begun several weeks earlier Fifteen days after the 9/11 attack, the US covertly inserted members of the CIA's Special Activities Division into Afghanistan, forming the Northern Afghanistan Liaison Team [137] They linked up with the Northern Alliance in the Panjshir Valley north of Kabul [138] In October, 12-man Special Forces teams began arriving in Afghanistan to work with the CIA and Northern Alliance [138] Within a few weeks the Northern Alliance, with assistance from the US ground and air forces, captured several key cities from the Taliban [139] [140] The Taliban retreated throughout the country, holding steady only in Kunduz Province, outmatched by US air support By November, the Taliban had lost control of most of the country [123]: 70–75 \n\n\n2002–2005: Taliban resurgence\nAfter initial success, the US lacked an obvious goal in Afghanistan beyond the counter-terrorism objectives of finding senior Taliban and Al-Qaeda leaders Nation-building was initially opposed by the Bush administration, but as the US stayed, it slowly crept into the rationale for staying In April 2002, Bush made a speech expressing a desire to rebuild Afghanistan The US also sought to instill democracy and women's rights as a moral matter The international community contributed to the development effort in Afghanistan, which focused on aid and creating institutions to run the country US reconstruction efforts also focused on improving education, health care, and community development The US also supported and funded the creation of an Afghan army in early 2002 However, the army was built slowly due to competing interests and a US belief that the Taliban were no longer a strong threat Some in the Bush administration preferred to use the Northern Alliance and warlords as the military instead of creating a new military The army became an afterthought and was poorly trained and equipped, which further enabled the Taliban [123]: 89–105 \n\n\nCoalition mistakes, Taliban start to re-organize\nAfter initial success, the US lacked an obvious goal in Afghanistan beyond the counter-terrorism objectives of finding senior Taliban and Al-Qaeda leaders Nation-building was initially opposed by the Bush administration, but as the US stayed, it slowly crept into the rationale for staying In April 2002, Bush made a

which further enabled the Taliban [123]: 89–105 \n\n\n2006–2007: Escalating war\n\nAs insurgent attacks in the country reportedly grew fourfold between 2002 and 2006, [169] by late 2007 Afghanistan was said to be in \"serious danger\" of falling into Taliban control despite the presence of 40,000 ISAF troops [170]\n\n2008-2009: NATO build-up, Pakistan skirmishes, and Karzai re-election\nOn 13 June 2008, Taliban fighters demonstrated their ongoing strength, liberating all prisoners in Kandahar jail The operation freed 1200 prisoners, 400 of whom were Taliban, causing a major embarrassment for NATO [194] By the end of 2008, the Taliban apparently had severed remaining ties with al-Qaeda [195] According to senior US military intelligence officials, perhaps fewer than 100 members of al-Qaeda remained in Afghanistan [196]\n\n\n2010–2011: Strategic agreements and death of Bin Laden\nDeployment of additional US troops continued in early 2010, with 9,000 of the planned 30,000 in place before the end of March and another 18,000 expected by June [233] The surge in troops supported a sixfold increase in Special Forces operations [234] The surge of American personnel that began in late 2009 ended by September 2012 [235] 700 airstrikes occurred in September 2010 alone versus 257 in all of 2009 [236]\n\n\n2012-2013: U.S. troop incidents, Obama-Karzai meetings\nBeginning in January 2012, incidents involving US troops [265] [266] [267] [268] [269] [270] occurred that were described by The Sydney Morning Herald as \"a series of damaging incidents and disclosures involving US troops in Afghanistan.\" [265] These incidents created fractures in the partnership between Afghanistan and ISAF, [271] raised the question whether discipline within US troops was breaking down, [272] undermined \"the image of foreign forces in a country where there is already deep resentment owing to civilian deaths and a perception among many Afghans that US troops lack respect for Afghan culture and people\" [273] and strained the relations between Afghanistan and the United States [266] [267] Besides an incident involving US troops who posed with body parts of dead insurgents and a video apparently showing a US helicopter crew singing \"bye-bye Miss American Pie\" before blasting a group of Afghan men with a Hellfire missile [273] [274] these \"high-profile US military incidents in Afghanistan\" [269] also included the 2012 Afghanistan Quran burning protests and the Panjwai shooting spree.\n\n2014–2015: Withdrawal and increase of insurgency\nThe UK and the US officially ended their combat operation in Afghanistan on 26 October 2014 The UK handed over its last base in Afghanistan, Camp Bastion, and the US handed over its last base, Camp Leatherneck, to Afghan forces [293] Around 500 UK troops remained in \"non-combat\" roles [294] [295] On 28 December, NATO officially ended combat operations in a ceremony held in Kabul [296] Continued operations by US forces within Afghanistan were under Operation Freedom's Sentinel; [297] and the new NATO mission was Operation Resolute Support [298]\n\n\n2016-2017: Collapse of peace talks, emergence of Islamic State\nIn January 2016, the US government sent a directive to the Pentagon which granted new legal authority for the US military to go on the offensive against Militants affiliated with the ISIL-KP, after the State Department announced the designation of ISIS in Afghanistan and Pakistan as a foreign terrorist organization The number of militants started with around 60 or 70, with most of them coming over the border with Pakistan but eventually [when?] ranged between 1,000 and 3,000 militants [344] They were mainly defectors from the Afghan and the Pakistani Taliban, and were generally confined to Nangarhar Province, and partially, Kunar province [344] [345]\n\n\n2018–2019: Peace overtures\nIn January 2018, the Taliban were openly active in 70% of the country (being in full control of 14 districts and have an active and open physical presence in a further 263) and the Islamic State was more active in the country than ever before Following recent attacks by the Taliban (including the Kabul ambulance bombing on 27 January) and Islamic State that killed scores of civilians, President Trump and Afghan officials decided to rule out any talks with the Taliban [380] However, on 27 February, following an increase in violence, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani proposed unconditional peace talks with the Taliban, offering them recognition as a legal political party and the release of the Taliban prisoners The offer was the most favorable to the Taliban since the war started It was preceded by months of national consensus building, which found that Afghans overwhelmingly supported a negotiated end to the war [381] [382] Two days earlier, the Taliban had called for talks with the US [383] On 27 March, a conference of 20 countries in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, backed the Afghan government's peace offer [384] The Taliban did not publicly respond to the offer [citation needed]\n\n\n2020: US-Taliban deal, beginning of US withdrawal\nOn 29 February, 2020, the United States and the Taliban signed a conditional peace deal in Doha, Qatar, [413] that called for a prisoner exchange within ten days and was supposed to lead to US troops withdrawal from Afghanistan within 14 months [85] [414] However, the Afghan government was not a party to the deal, and, in a press conference the next day, President Ghani criticized the deal for being \"signed behind closed doors.\" He said the Afghan government had \"made no commitment to free 5,000 Taliban prisoners\" and that such an action \"is not the United States' authority, but it is the authority of the government of Afghanistan.\" [415] [416] [86] [417]\n\n\n2021: End of US withdrawal, last Taliban offensive\nThe Taliban insurgency intensified considerably in 2021 coinciding with the withdrawal of United States and allied troops from Afghanistan [435] Since the US withdrawal, the number of casualties of women in the Afghanistan conflict rose by almost 40% in the first quarter of 2021 alone [436]\n\n\nImpact\nAccording to the Costs of War Project at Brown University, the war killed 46,319 Afghan civilians in Afghanistan However, the death toll is possibly higher due to unaccounted deaths by \"disease, loss of access to food, water, infrastructure, and/or other indirect consequences of the war.\" [90] A report titled Body Count put together by Physicians for Social Responsibility, Physicians for Global Survival and International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW) concluded that 106,000–170,000 civilians have been killed as a result of the fighting in Afghanistan at the hands of all parties to the conflict [458]\n\n\nCasualties\nAccording to the Costs of War Project at Brown University, the war killed 46,319 Afghan civilians in Afghanistan However, the death toll is possibly higher due to unaccounted deaths by \"disease, loss of access to food, water, infrastructure, and/or other indirect consequences of the war.\" [90] A report titled Body

civilians have been killed as a result of the fighting in Afghanistan at the hands of all parties to the conflict [458]\n\n\nRefugees\nMillions of Afghans have been internally displaced or become refugees as a result of decades of conflict in Afghanistan since 1979 From 2002 to 2012, more than 5.7 million former refugees returned to Afghanistan, increasing the country's population by 25% [470] [471] 2.6 million Afghans remained refugees in 2021 when the Taliban took over, [92] [472] while another 4 million were internally displaced [92] Following the Taliban takeover, over 122,000 people were airlifted abroad from Kabul airport, during the evacuation from Afghanistan, including Afghans, American citizens, and other foreign citizens [473]\n\n\nWar crimes\nWar crimes have been committed by both sides including civilian massacres, bombings of civilian targets, terrorism, use of torture and the murder of prisoners of war Additional common crimes include theft, arson, and destruction of property not warranted by military necessity.\n\n\nDrug trade\nIn 2000, Afghanistan accounted for an estimated 75% of the world's opium supply, [488] which was the Taliban's largest source of revenue through taxes on opium exports [489] Mullah Omar banned opium cultivation in 2001, [490] which observers said was an attempt to gain international recognition, raise opium prices and increase profit from the sale of large existing stockpiles [489] Opium production increased in the years following the October 2001 invasion, with Afghanistan producing 90% of the world's opium by 2005 [491] According to a 2018 SIGAR report, the US had spent $8.6 billion since 2002 to stop Afghanistan's drug trade A May 2021 SIGAR report estimated that the Taliban earned 60% of their revenue from the trade, while UN officials estimated more than $400 million was earned by the Taliban between 2018 and 2019, however other experts estimated that the Taliban earned at most $40 million annually [492]\n\n\nNATO's inability to stabilize Afghanistan\nObservers have argued that the mission in Afghanistan was hampered by a lack of agreement on objectives, a lack of resources, lack of coordination, too much focus on the central government at the expense of local and provincial governments, and too much focus on the country instead of the region [493]\n\n\nEnvironment and drug trade\nAccording to Cara Korte, climate change played a significant role in increasing instability in Afghanistan and strengthening the Taliban More than 60% of the Afghan population depend on agriculture and Afghanistan is the sixth most vulnerable country to climate change in the world according to the United Nations Environment Program and Afghanistan's National Environmental Protection Agency The Taliban used resentment over government inaction to climate change-induced drought and flooding to strengthen its support and Afghans were able to earn more money supporting the Taliban than from farming [494]\n\n\nEarly mistakes and the US's other war\nJournalist Jason Burke notes \"strategic mistakes by the US and allies in the immediate aftermath of the 2001 invasion\" as being a reason why the war went on for so long He also noted \"missed early opportunities\" to \"construct a stable political settlement.\" [496]\n\n\nDomestic corruption and politics\nIn 2009, Afghanistan was ranked as the world's second most-corrupt country [498] A lengthy report by SIGAR, and other findings, found that spiraling corruption in Afghanistan during the 2000s was not halted by the United States During this time, many elite figures in the country had effectively become kleptocrats, while ordinary Afghans were struggling [495]\n\n\nInfluence of non-NATO actors\nPakistan played a central role in the conflict A 2010 report published by the London School of Economics says that Pakistan's ISI has an \"official policy\" of support to the Taliban [503] \"Pakistan appears to be playing a double-game of astonishing magnitude\", the report states [503] Regarding the Afghan War documents leak, Der Spiegel wrote that \"the documents clearly show that the Pakistani intelligence agency Inter-Services Intelligence (usually known as the ISI) is the most important accomplice the Taliban has outside of Afghanistan.\" [504] Amrullah Saleh, former director of Afghanistan's intelligence service, stated, \"We talk about all these proxies  [Taliban, Haqqanis] but not the master of proxies, which is the Pakistan army The question is what does Pakistan's army want to achieve ...? They want to gain influence in the region.\" [505] Pakistan's role can be traced back to the Soviet war in which they funded the Mujahideen against the Soviets Pakistan's objective then as it is now is to ensure that Afghanistan has a regime friendly to their interests and will provide \"geopolitical depth in any future conflict with India.\" [506]\n\n\nAmerican public misleading\nIn December 2019 The Washington Post published 2,000 pages of government documents, mostly transcripts of interviews with more than 400 key figures involved in prosecuting the Afghanistan war According to the Post and The Guardian, the documents (dubbed the Afghanistan Papers) showed that US officials consistently and deliberately misled the American public about the unwinnable nature of the conflict, [511] and some commentators and foreign policy experts subsequently drew comparisons to the release of the Pentagon Papers [511] [512]\n\n\nForeign support for the Taliban\nThe Taliban's victory was facilitated in support from Pakistan Although Pakistan was a major US ally before and after the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, elements of the Pakistan government (including the military and intelligence services) have for decades maintained strong logistical and tactical ties with Taliban militants, and this support helped support the insurgency in Afghanistan [513] [514] For example, the Haqqani Network, a Taliban affiliate based on Pakistan, had strong support from Inter-Services Intelligence, the Pakistan intelligence agency [513] Taliban leaders found a safe haven in Pakistan, lived in the country, transacted business and earned funds there, and received medical treatment there [513] [514] Some elements of the Pakistani establishment sympathized with Taliban ideology, and many Pakistan officials considered the Taliban as an asset against India [513] [514] Bruce Riedel noted that \"The Pakistan Army believes Afghanistan provides strategic depth against India, which is their obsession.\" [514]\n\n\nPakistan\nThe Taliban's victory was facilitated in support from Pakistan Although Pakistan was a major US ally before and after the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, elements

Afghanistan provides strategic depth against India, which is their obsession.\" [514]\n\n\nRussia and Iran\nIn the initial aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, Iranian forces, led by Revolutionary Guard Commander Qassem Suleimani initially cooperated, secretly, with American officials against Al-Qaeda operatives and the Taliban, but that cooperation ended after the Axis of Evil Speech on January 29, 2002, which included calling Iran a major state sponsor of terror and threat to peace in the region Afterwards, Iranian forces became increasingly hostile to American forces in the region [143]\n\n\nReactions\nIn November 2001, the CNN reported widespread relief amongst Kabul's residents after the Taliban fled the city, with young men shaving off their beards and women taking off their burqas [516] Later that month the BBC's longtime Kabul correspondent Kate Clark reported that \"almost all women in Kabul are still choosing to veil\" but that many felt hopeful that the ousting of the Taliban would improve their safety and access to food [517]\n\n\nDomestic reactions\nIn November 2001, the CNN reported widespread relief amongst Kabul's residents after the Taliban

Kabul are still choosing to veil\" but that many felt hopeful that the ousting of the Taliban would improve their safety and access to food [517]\n\n\nInternational public opinion\nIn October 2001 when the invasion began, polls indicated that about 88% of Americans and about 65% of Britons backed military action [521] An Ipsos-Reid poll conducted between November and December 2001 showed that majorities in Canada (66%), France (60%), Germany (60%), Italy (58%), and the UK (65%) approved of US airstrikes while majorities in Argentina (77%), China (52%), South Korea (50%), Spain (52%), and Turkey (70%) opposed them [522]\n\n\nProtests, demonstrations and rallies\nThe war was the subject of large protests around the world, starting with the large-scale demonstrations in the days leading up to the invasion and every year since Many protesters considered the bombing and invasion of Afghanistan to be unjustified aggression [525] Dozens of organizations held a national march for peace in Washington, D.C., on 20 March 2010 [526]\n\n\nAftermath\nOn 7 September 2021, an interim government headed by Mohammad Hassan Akhund as Prime Minister was declared by the Taliban [527]\n\n\nFormation of the Taliban government and international recognition\nOn 7 September 2021, an interim government headed by Mohammad Hassan Akhund as Prime Minister was declared by the Taliban [527]\n\n\nRepublican insurgency\nOn 17 August 2021, Vice President Saleh, citing provisions of the Constitution of Afghanistan, declared himself President of Afghanistan from a base of operations in the Panjshir Valley, which had not been taken by Taliban forces, and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban from there [528] His claim to the presidency was endorsed by Ahmad Massoud and Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Minister of Defence Bismillah Khan Mohammadi [528] By 6 September the Taliban had regained control over most of the valley, but armed resistance continued in the upper valleys Clashes in the valley mostly ceased by mid-September [529] The leaders of the resistance, Saleh and Massoud reportedly fled to neighboring Tajikistan in late September [530] However, fighting between Taliban and pro-republican forces continued in other provinces Several regions had become the site of a guerrilla campaign by early 2022 [531] The NRF launched an offensive in May 2022, reportedly retaking territory in Panjshir [532] Other pro-republican rebel groups also emerged, including the \"Ahmad Khan Samangani Front\", [533] \"Afghan Freedom Front\", [534] \"Afghanistan Islamic National & Liberation Movement\", and several smaller factions [535]\n\n\nIslamic State activity\nFollowing the 2021 Kabul airport attack conducted by the terrorist group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province (a branch of the ISIL), the US said it could work with the Taliban to fight against the ISIS terrorists as part of the International military intervention against ISIL [536]\n\n\nAbandonment of Afghan allies\nAs many as 150,000 Afghans who assisted the United States remained in Afghanistan, including individuals who worked closely with US military forces [537] Hundreds of former Afghan special forces who fought alongside British troops in Afghanistan have been barred from resettling in the UK [538] [539] One former UK Special Forces officer told the BBC that \"At a time when certain actions by UK Special Forces are under investigation by a public inquiry, their headquarters also had the power to prevent former Afghan Special Forces colleagues and potential witnesses to these actions from getting safely to the UK.\" [540]\n\n\nHumanitarian crisis\nFollowing the Taliban takeover, western nations suspended humanitarian aid and the World Bank and International Monetary Fund also halted payments to Afghanistan [541] [542] The Biden administration froze about $9 billion in assets belonging to the Afghan central banks, blocking the Taliban from accessing billions of dollars held in US bank accounts [543] In October 2021, the UN stated that more than half of Afghanistan's 39 million people faced an acute food shortage [544] On 11 November 2021, the Human Rights Watch reported that Afghanistan is facing widespread famine due to collapsed economy and broken banking system [542] World leaders pledged $1.2 billion in humanitarian aid to Afghanistan [543] On 22 December 2021, The United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a US-proposed resolution to help humanitarian aid reach desperate Afghans, while seeking to keep funds out of Taliban hands [545]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**War in Afghanistan (2001–present)**\n\nThe

country's various other wars, [96] notably the ongoing Afghan conflict of which it was a part, [97] and the Soviet–Afghan War [98] [full citation needed] From the perspective of the West, the war is divided between 2001 and 2014 (the ISAF mission), when most combat operations were performed by coalition forces, a 2015 to 2021 (the Resolute Support Mission), when the Afghan armed forces did most of the fighting against the Taliban [citation needed] The war was named Operation Enduring Freedom from 2001 to 2014 [99] and as Operation Freedom's Sentinel from 2015 to 2021 by the US [100] Alternatively, it has been called the US War in Afghanistan [101] [102] [103] In Afghanistan itself, the war is known as simply the \"War in Afghanistan\" (Dari: جنگ در افغانستان Jang dar Afghanistan, Pashto: د افغانستان جګړه Da Afghanistan Jagra) [104] [105] [106]\n\n\nPrelude\nThe Taliban emerged from religious students known as the Talib who sought to end warlordism in Afghanistan through stricter adherence to Sharia [107] [108] On 27 September 1996, the Taliban, with military support by Pakistan and financial support from Saudi Arabia, seized Kabul and founded the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan [109] The Taliban imposed their fundamentalist Deobandi interpretation of Islam in areas under their control, issuing edicts forbidding women to work outside the home, attend school or to leave their homes unless accompanied by a male relative [110] According to the United Nations (UN), the Taliban, while trying to consolidate control over northern and western Afghanistan, committed systematic massacres against civilians UN officials stated that there had been \"15 massacres\" between 1996 and 2001, many of them targeting Shias and Hazaras [111] [112]\n\n\nRise of the

to use Afghanistan as a place to train and teach fighters, import weapons, coordinate with other jihadists, and plot terrorist actions [117] While Al-Qaeda maintained its own camps in Afghanistan, it also supported training camps of other organizations An estimated 10,000 to 20,000 men passed through these facilities before 9/11, most of whom were sent to fight for the Taliban against the United Front A smaller number were inducted into Al-Qaeda [118]\n\n\nSeptember 11 attacks\nOn the morning of Tuesday, September 11, 2001, a total of 19 men affiliated with Al-Qaeda carried out four coordinated attacks in the United States Four commercial passenger jet airliners were hijacked [120] [121] The hijackers intentionally crashed two of the airliners into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, killing everyone on board and more than 2,000 people in the buildings Both buildings collapsed within two hours from damage related to the crashes, destroying and damaging nearby buildings The hijackers crashed a third airliner into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C The fourth plane crashed into a field near Shanksville, in rural Pennsylvania, after some of its passengers and flight crew attempted to retake control of the plane, which the hijackers had redirected toward Washington, D.C., to target the White House, or the US Capitol No one aboard the flights survived The death toll among responders including firefighters and police was 836 as of 2009 [122] Total deaths were 2,996, including the 19 hijackers [122]\n\n\nUS ultimatum to the Taliban\nImmediately after the 9/11 attacks, the United States National Security Council agreed that military action would probably have to be taken against Al-Qaeda and the Taliban However, Bush decided to issue an ultimatum to the Taliban first, [123]: 54  demanding that the Taliban hand over Osama bin Laden, \"close immediately every terrorist training camp, hand over every terrorist and their supporters, and give the United States full access to terrorist training camps for inspection.\" [124] The same day, religious scholars met in Kabul, deciding that bin Laden should be surrendered; however, Mullah Omar decided that \"turning over Osama would only be a disgrace for us and Islamic thought and belief would be a weakness\", and that the US would continue making demands after surrendering bin Laden, who he claimed was innocent [123]: 56  The Taliban refused the ultimatum, saying that Osama bin Laden was protected by the traditional Pashtun laws of hospitality [125] [126]\n\n\nHistory\nThe war contained two main factions: the Coalition, which included the US and its allies (eventually supporting the government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan), fighting against the Taliban, its allies, and its militias Complicating the fight were Taliban splinter groups and other, more radical religious groups such as al-Qaeda and later the Islamic State These radical groups sometimes fought for the Taliban, sometimes fought for their own goals, and sometimes fought against both the Taliban and the government.\n\n\nTactical overview\nThe war contained

2001 by launching Operation Enduring Freedom, covert operations had begun several weeks earlier Fifteen days after the 9/11 attack, the US covertly inserted members of the CIA's Special Activities Division into Afghanistan, forming the Northern Afghanistan Liaison Team [137] They linked up with the Northern Alliance in the Panjshir Valley north of Kabul [138] In October, 12-man Special Forces teams began arriving in Afghanistan to work with the CIA and Northern Alliance [138] Within a few weeks the Northern Alliance, with assistance from the US ground and air forces, captured several key cities from the Taliban [139] [140] The Taliban retreated throughout the country, holding steady only in Kunduz Province, outmatched by US air support By November, the Taliban had lost control of most of the country [123]: 70–75 \n\n\n2002–2005: Taliban resurgence\nAfter initial success, the US lacked an obvious goal in Afghanistan beyond the counter-terrorism objectives of finding senior Taliban and Al-Qaeda leaders Nation-building was initially opposed by the Bush administration, but as the US stayed, it slowly crept into the rationale for staying In April 2002, Bush made a speech expressing a desire to rebuild Afghanistan The US also sought to instill democracy and women's rights as a moral matter The international community contributed to the development effort in Afghanistan, which focused on aid and creating institutions to run the country US reconstruction efforts also focused on improving education, health care, and community development The US also supported and funded the creation of an Afghan army in early 2002 However, the army was built slowly due to competing interests and a US belief that the Taliban were no longer a strong threat Some in the Bush administration preferred to use the Northern Alliance and warlords as the military instead of creating a new military The army became an afterthought and was poorly trained and equipped, which further enabled the Taliban [123]: 89–105 \n\n\nCoalition mistakes, Taliban start to re-organize\nAfter initial success, the US lacked an obvious goal in Afghanistan beyond the counter-terrorism objectives of finding

which further enabled the Taliban [123]: 89–105 \n\n\n2006–2007: Escalating war\n\nAs insurgent attacks in the country reportedly grew fourfold between 2002 and 2006, [169] by late 2007 Afghanistan was said to be in \"serious danger\" of falling into Taliban control despite the presence of 40,000 ISAF troops [170]\n\n2008-2009: NATO build-up, Pakistan skirmishes, and Karzai re-election\nOn 13 June 2008, Taliban fighters demonstrated their ongoing strength, liberating all prisoners in Kandahar jail The operation freed 1200 prisoners, 400 of whom were Taliban, causing a major embarrassment for NATO [194] By the end of 2008, the Taliban apparently had severed remaining ties with al-Qaeda [195] According to senior US military intelligence officials, perhaps fewer than 100 members of al-Qaeda remained in Afghanistan [196]\n\n\n2010–2011: Strategic agreements and death of Bin Laden\nDeployment of additional US troops continued in early 2010, with 9,000 of the planned 30,000 in place before the end of March and another 18,000 expected by June [233] The surge in troops supported a sixfold increase in Special Forces operations [234] The surge of American personnel that began in late 2009 ended by September 2012 [235] 700 airstrikes occurred in September 2010 alone versus 257 in all of 2009 [236]\n\n\n2012-2013: U.S. troop incidents, Obama-Karzai meetings\nBeginning in January 2012, incidents involving US troops [265] [266] [267] [268] [269] [270] occurred that were described by The Sydney Morning Herald as \"a series of damaging incidents and disclosures involving US troops in Afghanistan.\" [265] These incidents created fractures in the partnership between Afghanistan and ISAF, [271] raised the question whether discipline within US troops was breaking down, [272] undermined \"the image of foreign forces in a country where there is already deep resentment owing to civilian deaths and a perception among many Afghans that US troops lack respect for Afghan culture and people\" [273] and strained the relations between Afghanistan and the United States [266] [267] Besides an incident involving US troops who posed with body parts of dead insurgents and a video apparently showing a US helicopter crew singing \"bye-bye Miss American Pie\" before blasting a group of Afghan men with a Hellfire missile [273] [274] these \"high-profile US military incidents in Afghanistan\" [269] also included the 2012 Afghanistan Quran burning protests and the Panjwai shooting spree.\n\n2014–2015: Withdrawal and increase of insurgency\nThe UK and the US officially ended their combat operation in Afghanistan on 26 October 2014 The UK handed over its last base in Afghanistan, Camp Bastion, and the US handed over its last base, Camp Leatherneck, to Afghan forces [293] Around 500 UK troops remained in \"non-combat\" roles [294] [295] On 28 December, NATO officially ended combat operations in a ceremony held in Kabul [296] Continued operations by US forces within Afghanistan were under Operation Freedom's Sentinel; [297] and the new NATO mission was Operation Resolute Support [298]\n\n\n2016-2017: Collapse of peace talks, emergence of Islamic State\nIn January 2016, the US government sent a directive to the Pentagon which granted new legal authority for the US military to go on the offensive against Militants affiliated with the ISIL-KP, after the State Department announced the designation of ISIS in Afghanistan and Pakistan as a foreign terrorist organization The number of militants started with around 60 or 70, with most of them coming over the border with Pakistan but eventually [when?] ranged between 1,000 and 3,000 militants [344] They were mainly defectors from the Afghan and the Pakistani Taliban, and were generally confined to Nangarhar Province, and partially, Kunar province [344] [345]\n\n\n2018–2019: Peace overtures\nIn January 2018, the Taliban were openly active in 70% of the country (being in full control of 14 districts and have an active and open physical presence in a further 263) and the Islamic State was more active in the country than ever before Following recent attacks by the Taliban (including the Kabul ambulance bombing on 27 January) and Islamic State that killed scores of civilians, President Trump and Afghan officials decided to rule out any talks with the Taliban [380] However, on 27 February, following an increase in violence, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani proposed unconditional peace talks with the Taliban, offering them recognition as a legal political party and the release of the Taliban prisoners The offer was the most favorable to the Taliban since the war started It was preceded by months of national consensus building, which found that Afghans overwhelmingly supported a negotiated end to the war [381] [382] Two days earlier, the Taliban had called for talks with the US [383] On 27 March, a conference of 20 countries in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, backed the Afghan government's peace offer [384] The Taliban did not publicly respond to the offer [citation needed]\n\n\n2020: US-Taliban deal, beginning of US withdrawal\nOn 29 February, 2020, the United States and the Taliban signed a conditional peace deal in Doha, Qatar, [413] that called for a prisoner exchange within ten days and was supposed to lead to US troops withdrawal from Afghanistan within 14 months [85] [414] However, the Afghan government was not a party to the deal, and, in a press conference the next day, President Ghani criticized the deal for being \"signed behind closed doors.\" He said the Afghan government had \"made no commitment to free 5,000 Taliban prisoners\" and that such an action \"is not the United States' authority, but it is the authority of the government of Afghanistan.\" [415] [416] [86] [417]\n\n\n2021: End of US withdrawal, last Taliban offensive\nThe Taliban insurgency intensified considerably in 2021 coinciding with the withdrawal of United States and allied troops from Afghanistan [435] Since the US withdrawal, the number of casualties of women in the Afghanistan conflict rose by almost 40% in the first quarter of 2021 alone [436]\n\n\nImpact\nAccording to the Costs of War Project at Brown University, the war killed 46,319 Afghan civilians in Afghanistan However, the death toll is possibly higher due to unaccounted deaths by \"disease, loss of access to food, water, infrastructure, and/or other indirect consequences of the war.\" [90] A report titled Body Count put together by Physicians for Social Responsibility, Physicians for Global Survival and International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW) concluded that 106,000–170,000 civilians have been killed as a result of the fighting in Afghanistan at the hands of all parties to the conflict [458]\n\n\nCasualties\nAccording to the Costs of War Project at Brown University, the war killed 46,319 Afghan civilians in Afghanistan However, the death toll is possibly higher due to unaccounted deaths by \"disease, loss of access to food, water, infrastructure, and/or other indirect consequences of the war.\" [90] A report titled Body Count put together by Physicians for Social Responsibility, Physicians for Global Survival and International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW) concluded that 106,000–170,000 civilians have been killed as a result of the fighting in Afghanistan at the hands of all parties to the conflict [458]\n\n\nRefugees\nMillions of Afghans have been internally displaced or become refugees as a result of decades of conflict in Afghanistan since 1979 From 2002 to 2012, more than 5.7 million former refugees returned to Afghanistan, increasing the country's population by 25% [470] [471] 2.6 million Afghans remained refugees in 2021 when the Taliban took over, [92] [472] while another 4 million were internally displaced [92] Following the Taliban takeover, over 122,000 people were airlifted abroad from Kabul airport, during the evacuation from Afghanistan, including Afghans, American citizens, and other foreign citizens [473]\n\n\nWar crimes\nWar crimes have been committed by both sides including civilian massacres, bombings of civilian targets, terrorism, use of torture and the murder of prisoners of war Additional common crimes include theft, arson, and destruction of property not warranted by military necessity.\n\n\nDrug trade\nIn 2000, Afghanistan accounted for an estimated 75% of the world's opium supply, [488] which was the Taliban's largest source of revenue through taxes on opium exports [489] Mullah Omar banned opium cultivation in 2001, [490] which observers said was an attempt to gain international recognition, raise opium prices and increase profit from the sale of large existing stockpiles [489] Opium production increased in the years following the October 2001 invasion, with Afghanistan producing 90% of the world's opium by 2005 [491] According to a 2018 SIGAR report, the US had spent $8.6 billion since 2002 to stop Afghanistan's drug trade A May 2021 SIGAR report estimated that the Taliban earned 60% of their revenue from the trade, while UN officials estimated more than $400 million was earned by the Taliban between 2018 and 2019, however other experts estimated that the Taliban earned at most $40 million annually [492]\n\n\nNATO's inability to stabilize Afghanistan\nObservers have argued that the mission in Afghanistan was hampered by a lack of agreement on objectives, a lack of resources, lack of coordination, too much focus on the central government at the expense of local and provincial governments, and too much focus on the country instead of the region [493]\n\n\nEnvironment and drug trade\nAccording to Cara Korte, climate change played a significant role in increasing instability in Afghanistan and strengthening the Taliban More than 60% of the Afghan population depend on agriculture and Afghanistan is the sixth most vulnerable country to climate change in the world according to the United Nations Environment Program and Afghanistan's National Environmental Protection Agency The Taliban used resentment over government inaction to climate change-induced drought and flooding to strengthen its support and Afghans were able to earn more money supporting the Taliban than from farming [494]\n\n\nEarly mistakes and the US's other war\nJournalist Jason Burke notes \"strategic mistakes by the US and allies in the immediate aftermath of the 2001 invasion\" as being a reason why the war went on for so long He also noted \"missed early opportunities\" to \"construct a stable political settlement.\" [496]\n\n\nDomestic corruption and politics\nIn 2009, Afghanistan was ranked as the world's second most-corrupt country [498] A lengthy report by SIGAR, and other findings, found that spiraling corruption in Afghanistan during the 2000s was not halted by the United States During this time, many elite figures in the country had effectively become kleptocrats, while ordinary Afghans were struggling [495]\n\n\nInfluence of non-NATO actors\nPakistan played a central role in the conflict A 2010 report published by the London School of Economics says that Pakistan's ISI has an \"official policy\" of support to the Taliban [503] \"Pakistan appears to be playing a double-game of astonishing magnitude\", the report states [503] Regarding the Afghan War documents leak, Der Spiegel wrote that \"the documents clearly show that the Pakistani intelligence agency Inter-Services Intelligence (usually known as the ISI) is the most important accomplice the Taliban has outside of Afghanistan.\" [504] Amrullah Saleh, former director of Afghanistan's intelligence service, stated, \"We talk about all these proxies  [Taliban, Haqqanis] but not the master of proxies, which is the Pakistan army The question is what does Pakistan's army want to achieve ...? They want to gain influence in the region.\" [505] Pakistan's role can be traced back to the Soviet war in which they funded the Mujahideen against the Soviets Pakistan's objective then as it is now is to ensure that Afghanistan has a regime friendly to their interests and will provide \"geopolitical depth in any future conflict with India.\" [506]\n\n\nAmerican public misleading\nIn December 2019 The Washington Post published 2,000 pages of government documents, mostly transcripts of interviews with more than 400 key figures involved in prosecuting the Afghanistan war According to the Post and The Guardian, the documents (dubbed the Afghanistan Papers) showed that US officials consistently and deliberately misled the American public about the unwinnable nature of the conflict, [511] and some commentators and foreign policy experts subsequently drew comparisons to the release of the Pentagon Papers [511] [512]\n\n\nForeign support for the Taliban\nThe Taliban's victory was facilitated in support from Pakistan Although Pakistan was a major US ally before and after the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, elements of the Pakistan government (including the military and intelligence services) have for decades maintained strong logistical and tactical ties with Taliban militants, and this support helped support the insurgency in Afghanistan [513] [514] For example, the Haqqani Network, a Taliban affiliate based on Pakistan, had strong support from Inter-Services Intelligence, the Pakistan intelligence agency [513] Taliban leaders found a safe haven in Pakistan, lived in the country, transacted business and earned funds there, and received medical treatment there [513] [514] Some elements of the Pakistani establishment sympathized with Taliban ideology, and many Pakistan officials considered the Taliban as an asset against India [513] [514] Bruce Riedel noted that \"The Pakistan Army believes Afghanistan provides strategic depth against India, which is their obsession.\" [514]\n\n\nPakistan\nThe Taliban's victory was facilitated in support from Pakistan Although Pakistan was a major US ally before and after the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, elements

Afghanistan provides strategic depth against India, which is their obsession.\" [514]\n\n\nRussia and Iran\nIn the initial aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, Iranian forces, led by Revolutionary Guard Commander Qassem Suleimani initially cooperated, secretly, with American officials against Al-Qaeda operatives and the Taliban, but that cooperation ended after the Axis of Evil Speech on January 29, 2002, which included calling Iran a major state sponsor of terror and threat to peace in the region Afterwards, Iranian forces became increasingly hostile to American forces in the region [143]\n\n\nReactions\nIn November 2001, the CNN reported widespread relief amongst Kabul's residents after the Taliban fled the city, with young men shaving off their beards and women taking off their burqas [516] Later that month the BBC's longtime Kabul correspondent Kate Clark reported that \"almost all women in Kabul are still choosing to veil\" but that many felt hopeful that the ousting of the Taliban would improve their safety and access to food [517]\n\n\nDomestic reactions\nIn November 2001, the CNN reported widespread relief amongst Kabul's residents after the Taliban

Kabul are still choosing to veil\" but that many felt hopeful that the ousting of the Taliban would improve their safety and access to food [517]\n\n\nInternational public opinion\nIn October 2001 when the invasion began, polls indicated that about 88% of Americans and about 65% of Britons backed military action [521] An Ipsos-Reid poll conducted between November and December 2001 showed that majorities in Canada (66%), France (60%), Germany (60%), Italy (58%), and the UK (65%) approved of US airstrikes while majorities in Argentina (77%), China (52%), South Korea (50%), Spain (52%), and Turkey (70%) opposed them [522]\n\n\nProtests, demonstrations and rallies\nThe war was the subject of large protests around the world, starting with the large-scale demonstrations in the days leading up to the invasion and every year since Many protesters considered the bombing and invasion of Afghanistan to be unjustified aggression [525] Dozens of organizations held a national march for peace in Washington, D.C., on 20 March 2010 [526]\n\n\nAftermath\nOn 7 September 2021, an interim government headed by Mohammad Hassan Akhund as Prime Minister was declared by the Taliban [527]\n\n\nFormation of the Taliban government and international recognition\nOn 7 September 2021, an interim government headed by Mohammad Hassan Akhund as Prime Minister was declared by the Taliban [527]\n\n\nRepublican insurgency\nOn 17 August 2021, Vice President Saleh, citing provisions of the Constitution of Afghanistan, declared himself President of Afghanistan from a base of operations in the Panjshir Valley, which had not been taken by Taliban forces, and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban from there [528] His claim to the presidency was endorsed by Ahmad Massoud and Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Minister of Defence Bismillah Khan Mohammadi [528] By 6 September the Taliban had regained control over most of the valley, but armed resistance continued in the upper valleys Clashes in the valley mostly ceased by mid-September [529] The leaders of the resistance, Saleh and Massoud reportedly fled to neighboring Tajikistan in late September [530] However, fighting between Taliban and pro-republican forces continued in other provinces Several regions had become the site of a guerrilla campaign by early 2022 [531] The NRF launched an offensive in May 2022, reportedly retaking territory in Panjshir [532] Other pro-republican rebel groups also emerged, including the \"Ahmad Khan Samangani Front\", [533] \"Afghan Freedom Front\", [534] \"Afghanistan Islamic National & Liberation Movement\", and several smaller factions [535]\n\n\nIslamic State activity\nFollowing the 2021 Kabul airport attack conducted by the terrorist group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province (a branch of the ISIL), the US said it could work with the Taliban to fight against the ISIS terrorists as part of the International military intervention against ISIL [536]\n\n\nAbandonment of Afghan allies\nAs many as 150,000 Afghans who assisted the United States remained in Afghanistan, including individuals who worked closely with US military forces [537] Hundreds of former Afghan special forces who fought alongside British troops in Afghanistan have been barred from resettling in the UK [538] [539] One former UK Special Forces officer told the BBC that \"At a time when certain actions by UK Special Forces are under investigation by a public inquiry, their headquarters also had the power to prevent former Afghan Special Forces colleagues and potential witnesses to these actions from getting safely to the UK.\" [540]\n\n\nHumanitarian crisis\nFollowing the Taliban takeover, western nations suspended humanitarian aid and the World Bank and International Monetary Fund also halted payments to Afghanistan [541] [542] The Biden administration froze about $9 billion in assets belonging to the Afghan central banks, blocking the Taliban from accessing billions of dollars held in US bank accounts [543] In October 2021, the UN stated that more than half of Afghanistan's 39 million people faced an acute food shortage [544] On 11 November 2021, the Human Rights Watch reported that Afghanistan is facing widespread famine due to collapsed economy and broken banking system [542] World leaders pledged $1.2 billion in humanitarian aid to Afghanistan [543] On 22 December 2021, The United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a US-proposed resolution to help humanitarian aid reach desperate Afghans, while seeking to keep funds out of Taliban hands [545]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Juwan_Howard", "content": "\nEarly life\nHoward's grandmother, Jannie Mae Howard, was the daughter of sharecroppers from Belzoni, Mississippi She had four daughters by her 19th birthday, including Howard's mother Helena Helena was an employee at a Chicago restaurant when she became pregnant with Juwan Howard's father, Leroy Watson, had just returned from the Army to a phone company job in Chicago The two married quickly once they realized Helena was pregnant For Howard's first week of life, his high school junior mother kept him in a drawer at Jannie Mae's house [4] Helena, who was 17 years old, did not want to be restricted or burdened raising her child, so Jannie Mae adopted him [5] His biological father, Leroy Watson Jr., wanted to name him Leroy Watson, III, but his grandmother rejected the suggestion, insisting on Juwan Antonio Howard [6] Although his mother visited on occasion as he was growing up, his grandmother raised him, [4] along with two cousins [7] Howard has no siblings and is not close to his biological parents; [8] his grandmother was the primary influence in his life [4] He moved with her to several low-income Chicago South Side projects; she kept him out of trouble and away from gangs as he was growing up [4] One of their residences was a three-bedroom apartment on 69th Street on the South Side of Chicago [5] As he blossomed under his grandmother's influence and discipline, he became her \"pride and joy\" [5]\n\n\nHigh school\nHoward went to Chicago Vocational Career Academy, where he went on to play three seasons of varsity basketball [9] Vocational had an unheated gym and no locker rooms, which required that the team dress for games in a history classroom [7] Nonetheless, Howard went on to be named a 1991 All-American basketball player by Parade magazine and won McDonald's All American honors He was also chosen for the National Honor Society and served as Vocational's homecoming king [5] [6] [10] [11] During recruiting visits by college coaches such as Illinois' Lou Henson, DePaul's Joey Meyer and Michigan's Steve Fisher, Jannie Mae Howard did most of the questioning [6]\n\n\nSophomore year\nAs his sophomore year began, media reports alleged that three Wolverines basketball players were paid $300 each to participate in a charity basketball tournament in mid-1992, during the off-season The reports further alleged that some others, including Howard, appeared at several summer basketball camps together, which was a possible violation of NCAA rules [76] At the beginning of his 1992–93 sophomore season, Michigan returned its top nine scorers and began the season ranked number one in the country by the Associated Press [77] Michigan lost its second game of the season in a rematch with Duke [78] Howard was described as the steadiest player on the team that season by coach Fisher [79] During the season, Howard purchased a million-dollar disability insurance policy approved by the NCAA under the Exceptional Student Athlete Disability Insurance Program available to student-athletes who are projected to be chosen high in the NBA, National Football League (NFL), and Major League Baseball drafts [80]\n\n\nJunior year\nWith Webber's departure for the NBA after his sophomore season, the 1993–94 Wolverines team entered the season ranked fifth in the nation as it opened the season against number 13 Georgia Tech [90] Since his grandmother had been born on December 25, Howard got a tattoo reading \"Jannie Mae\" over his heart during Christmas break [7] During the season, Howard contracted the chicken pox in January [91] Michigan had a 21–6 (13–4 Big Ten) record and tied with the Purdue Boilermakers for the conference lead with one game remaining [92] Michigan then lost (for the third time in its last four games) to a struggling Northwestern Wildcats team, [93] and finished second in the Big Ten [94] After the season, Howard was selected as a first team All-Big-Ten member along with his teammate Rose, Purdue's Robinson, Michigan State's Shawn Respert, and Indiana's Damon Bailey [95] In the opening round of the 1994 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, Howard helped Michigan to a 78–74 overtime victory over Pepperdine by scoring 28 points and adding 9 rebounds before fouling out [96] In the second round, Howard posted 34 points and 18 rebounds to lead the team to an 84–79 victory over Texas [97] Michigan faced a Joe Smith-led Maryland in the Sweet Sixteen round [94] Howard scored 24 points and had 11 rebounds before fouling out with 2:49 remaining in the 78–71 victory [98] Howard earned the regional MVP award with a game-high 30 points and 13 rebounds in the Elite Eight round, despite collecting two fouls in the first two minutes and losing against the Arkansas Razorbacks, which had United States President Bill Clinton in attendance as a vocal supporter [99]\n\n\nSenior year\nDuring Michigan's in-home visit, Howard's grandmother treated Michigan head coach Fisher, his assistants Mike Boyd and Brian Dutcher, Vocational coach Cook, Vocational assistant coach Donnie Kirskey, Lois Howard (Howard's aunt) and Howard to a soul food dinner [39] Dutcher had the responsibility to contact Howard several times a week [40] Howard grew close to assistant coach Kirskey, often staying at his house and using his car once he got a driver's license [41] During the summer 1990 30-day visitation period, Dutcher watched Howard practice 28 consecutive days [40] Dutcher developed an understanding of the dynamics of Howard's relationship with his grandmother While other coaches, such as Lute Olson, almost ignored her during the recruiting, Dutcher understood that she was the key influence on his life, [4] and understood that Kirskey also had sway with Howard He encouraged Fisher to hire Kirskey for a summer basketball camp, which became the young athlete's introduction to Ann Arbor, Michigan [41]\n\n\nCollege career\nHoward matriculated to the University of Michigan and joined his fellow freshmen for the 1991–92 Michigan Wolverines in forming a group that became known as the Fab Five He also joined future NBA personalities Eric Riley and Rob Pelinka [61] As Michigan celebrated Midnight Madness on October 15, 1991, there was already talk that at least four of the five freshmen would be starting before the season ended [62] (The five eventually started in a combined 304 of a possible 350 man-games among them during their first two seasons.) [63] Early in his freshman season, Howard started in some games and came off the bench in others for the highly rated Wolverines [64] Over time, he won a starting role from Riley [65] In Michigan's first matchup against Illinois, Howard scored 13 points and denied Thomas the ball consistently enough to hold him to 8 shots His biggest contribution in the game was getting his hand on a loose ball to force a jump ball with 16 seconds left and Michigan leading by only three points [66] In the Elite Eight round of the 1992 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, Michigan faced a Jimmy Jackson-led Ohio State Buckeyes team that had beaten them twice during the regular season by double-digit margins [67] Michigan won the rematch, during which the Fab Five scored all but two of the Wolverines' points [68]\n\n\nFreshman year\nHoward matriculated to the University of Michigan and joined his fellow freshmen for the 1991–92 Michigan Wolverines in forming a group that became known as the Fab Five He also joined future NBA personalities Eric Riley and Rob Pelinka [61] As Michigan celebrated Midnight Madness on October 15, 1991, there was already talk that at least four of the five freshmen would be starting before the season ended [62] (The five eventually started in a combined 304 of a possible 350 man-games among them during their first two seasons.)

to force a jump ball with 16 seconds left and Michigan leading by only three points [66] In the Elite Eight round of the 1992 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, Michigan faced a Jimmy Jackson-led Ohio State Buckeyes team that had beaten them twice during the regular season by double-digit margins [67] Michigan won the rematch, during which the Fab Five scored all but two of the

despite collecting two fouls in the first two minutes and losing against the Arkansas Razorbacks, which had United States President Bill Clinton in attendance as a vocal supporter [99]\n\n\nGraduation\nHoward became the first NBA athlete who entered the draft early and graduated with his academic class, [105] thus fulfilling a promise he had made to his grandmother on the last day he saw her alive [106] [107] He told Mitch Albom that when he made it to the NBA, he realized how much leisure time the multimillionaire players had and decided to do something productive instead of find ways to spend his new riches \"I knew if I kept pushing it off, I'd never get it done\", he said He completed his final 32 course hours by taking summer classes in 1994 during the NBA off-season He took correspondence classes and independent study courses during the following season, studying on road trips and mailing in his papers from the nearest post office In the end, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in communications at Michigan He told Albom that earning his degree made him a better example when speaking about staying in school [107] Although Howard had spent the prior year playing in the NBA, he returned to campus to partake in graduation ceremonies with his classmates [106] During the graduation, keynote speaker Marian Wright Edelman paid special recognition to Howard and Fab Five teammates King and Jackson, who graduated together, and noted that Howard's graduation made him a role model for children [108]\n\n\nForfeits\nAlthough the Fab Five's games in the Final Four have since been forfeited, [109] Howard was not among the players, which included Robert Traylor, Webber, Rose, Maurice Taylor, and Louis Bullock, called before a grand jury to testify [110] in the University of Michigan basketball scandal He was not implicated in the scandal [111] Although Michigan erased many of its records and accomplishments from 1992 to 1998 as part of self-imposed sanctions, Howard's status as a 1993–94 All-American remained intact [63]\n\n\nProfessional career\nEntering the 1994–95 season, the NBA players and owners had not yet agreed on the terms of a new collective bargaining agreement, and Howard was unsigned two weeks before training camp began He continued to train in Chicago in late September amidst rumors that his draft rights could be traded to another team [104] While holding out, he was rumored to be part of a trade package with the Chicago Bulls that included Calbert Cheaney and a first-round draft choice in exchange for Scottie Pippen [112] [113] Another rumor had Howard being packaged with Rex Chapman and Don MacLean for Pippen [114] On November 9, eleventh overall 1994 NBA draft selection Carlos Rogers signed an NBA contract, making Howard the last first-round selection without a contract [115] He missed most of the first month of the season and resided at an O'Hare Airport hotel while protracted talks continued [112] Howard's agent David Falk said that one of the main problems was that the Bullets wanted Howard to sign for a lower average salary than number six selection Sharone Wright [7] The Bullets stuck to a 10-year, $30 million ($61.7 million in 2023 dollars [116]) offer [117] On November 17, [118] Howard signed what was believed to be a 12-year, $37.5 million ($77.1 million) contract [112] Howard's contract, which Sports Illustrated later said was an 11-year $36 million ($74 million) deal, had an escape clause [7] Once he signed, he was reunited with Michigan teammate Webber as a member of the Bullets [119] Webber, who had also sat out training camp and the first eight games of the season, [120] was traded from the Golden State Warriors to the Bullets on November 18 for Tom Gugliotta and three first-round draft choices [118]\n\n\nWashington Bullets / Wizards (1994–2001)\nEntering the 1994–95 season, the NBA players and owners had not yet agreed on the terms of a new collective bargaining agreement, and Howard was unsigned two weeks before training camp began He continued to train in Chicago in late September amidst rumors that his draft rights could be traded to another team [104] While holding out, he was rumored to be part of a trade package with the Chicago Bulls that included Calbert Cheaney and a first-round draft choice in exchange for Scottie Pippen [112] [113] Another rumor had Howard being packaged with Rex Chapman and Don MacLean for Pippen [114] On November 9, eleventh overall 1994 NBA draft selection Carlos Rogers signed an NBA contract, making

[119] Webber, who had also sat out training camp and the first eight games of the season, [120] was traded from the Golden State Warriors to the Bullets on November 18 for Tom Gugliotta and three first-round draft choices [118]\n\n\n1994–95 season: Rookie season\nEntering the 1994–95 season, the NBA players and owners had not yet agreed on the terms of a new collective bargaining agreement, and Howard was unsigned two weeks before training camp began He continued to train in Chicago in late September amidst rumors that his draft rights could be traded to another team [104] While holding out, he was rumored to be part of a trade package with the Chicago Bulls that included Calbert Cheaney and a first-round draft choice in exchange for Scottie Pippen [112] [113] Another rumor had

who had also sat out training camp and the first eight games of the season, [120] was traded from the Golden State Warriors to the Bullets on November 18 for Tom Gugliotta and three first-round draft choices [118]\n\n\n1995–96 season: All-Star selection\nIn the preseason, the Bullets played the Detroit Pistons in an October game at the University of Michigan's Crisler Arena, marking a homecoming for Howard Webber was sidelined with a shoulder injury and missed the homecoming [128] Prior to the 1995–96 season, the Bullets were expected to be a contender with Webber, Howard, Muresan, Mark Price, and Robert Pack However, Webber, Price and Pack missed almost the entire year (65, 75 and 51 games, respectively) because of injuries [129]\n\n\n1996–97 season: Free agency dispute\nAfter averaging 17 points per game as a rookie and more than 22 per game in his second season, Howard became a free agent when the Bullets made some salary cap transactions The Bullets offered Howard an $89 million contract, but the Miami Heat outbid them with a seven-year deal estimated to be worth $98 to $101 million However, according to the NBA league office, the Heat miscalculated their available salary under the salary cap by excluding performance bonuses for Tim Hardaway and P J Brown and failing to account for the impact of renegotiating Alonzo Mourning's contract before coming to terms with Howard [137] The league rejected the contract on July 31 because Howard's $9 million for the 1996–97 season placed the Heat over the cap [137] [138] Howard then re-signed with the Bullets on August 5 He became the first player in NBA history to sign a contract worth more than $100 million; [139] [140] his seven-year contract was worth $105 million (equivalent to $204,000,000 in 2023) The league ruled on August 5 that the Bullets could re-sign Howard after having renounced his rights on July 15 to free up cap room to sign Tracy Murray and Lorenzo Williams if they forfeited their 1997 NBA draft first-round selection rights [141] The Bullets were not limited by the cap because they were re-signing their own player [138] The Heat pursued legal remedy in Florida state courts, seeking acknowledgment of the prior validity and superiority of their earlier contract [141] Although an arbitration case involving the two contracts that Howard had signed appeared likely, ESPN reported that the Heat dropped their legal pursuit of Howard [142] The league moved for federal jurisdiction although the case remained on the docket for New York University Law professor Daniel Collins to serve as arbitrator on three issues Meanwhile, the Heat's contract was protected by a temporary injunction in Florida state court, which forbade any newer contract by Howard from abrogating his Miami contract [134] The Heat eventually dropped their case but the team, especially head coach Pat Riley, continued to vehemently claim that their case of wrongdoing in the form of erroneous rulings by the league had been very solid [143] [144] If the Heat had pursued arbitration and had been found guilty of violating the salary cap, the team could have been fined $5 million and Heat coach Riley could have been suspended for the season By dropping their actions, the Heat avoided any possible penalties [145]\n\n\n1997–98 season\nThe Wizards relocated from the US Airways Arena to the MCI Center for the 1997–98 season, [156] during which Howard totaled 11 double-doubles in 64 games, [157] while averaging 18.5 points and 8.0 rebounds [133] He scored between 20 and 29 points 31 times that season but failed to score 30 points in any game [157] Howard injured his ankle and was unable to play between February 5 and March 17 [157] [158] During Bickerstaff's only full season as the Washington coach, the team posted a 42–40 record [159]\n\n\n1998–99 season\nAfter the 1998–99 NBA lockout, the Wizards posted an 18–32 record in the shortened season The team started out 13–19 under Bickerstaff and was 5–13 under Jim Brovelli after Bickerstaff was fired [160] Howard was a vocal critic of Bickerstaff throughout his tenure, stating the coach was unable to make proper in-game adjustments [161] Howard, who again had an ankle injury, [162] missed the last 14 games of the season Over the course of the 1998–99 season, he posted 11 double-doubles and two 15-rebound performances in 36 games, [163] while averaging 18.9 points and 7.0 rebounds [133]\n\n\n1999–00 season\nDuring the 1999–2000 season, Howard accumulated 10 double-doubles in 82 games, [164] while averaging 14.9 points and 8.1 rebounds [133] The Wizards endured a 14–30 start under head coach Gar Heard before going 15–23 under Heard's replacement, Darrell Walker [165] According to Sam Smith from the Chicago Tribune, Howard had become unpopular and a bit of a disappointment by his sixth season in Washington [166] He posted 30 points twice, [164] including a season-high 36 in a fourth-quarter comeback to end a five-game losing streak in January [167] During the offseason, Howard's name surfaced in trade rumors that had him going to the New York Knicks in exchange for Ewing because the Wizards' management thought that the trade would better position the team for the 2001 free agent market [168] Following the season, Walker was replaced by Leonard Hamilton, becoming the team's sixth head coach since last making the NBA playoffs four years earlier [169]\n\n\n2000–01 season\nAlthough it had been five years since his only All-Star appearance, Howard was the fourth-highest-paid player in the NBA during the 2000–01 season, behind Kevin Garnett, Shaquille O'Neal and Mourning [170] Howard, along with Strickland and Richmond, were marquee names on the team under contract to earn at least $10 million [169] [171] On December 31, 2000, Howard, posted his career high of 15 made free throws in a game against the Detroit Pistons [133]\n\n\nDallas Mavericks (2001–2002)\nMichael Jordan, who had become the Wizards' head of basketball operations the prior season, traded Howard, Obinna Ekezie, and Calvin Booth to the Dallas Mavericks for Laettner, Loy Vaught, Etan Thomas, Hubert Davis, Courtney Alexander and $3 million on February 22, 2001, at the NBA trade deadline [172] [173] Jordan's move was praised for freeing up salary cap space in advance of the NBA's first season with a luxury tax [174] The trade served the Mavericks by giving them a new offensive weapon and enabling them to match up defensively against the NBA Western Conference power forwards such as Wallace, Tim Duncan, Karl Malone and Webber [174] [175] Washington finished the year with a 19–63 record under coach Hamilton [176]\n\n\nDenver Nuggets (2002–2003)\nThe Mavericks traded Howard with Donnell Harvey, Hardaway and a 2002 first-round pick to the Denver Nuggets for Raef LaFrentz, Avery Johnson, Van Exel and Tariq Abdul-Wahad on February 21, 2002 [103] [183] At the time of the trade, Howard was considered the Mavericks' best low-post defender [184] On March 25, 2002, he scored his 10,000th career point at Madison Square Garden against the New York Knicks [185] Howard started all 28 games that he played for the Nuggets [182] Don Nelson's Mavericks went to the second round of the 2002 NBA Playoffs after trading Howard, [186] while the Nuggets failed to make the playoffs under coaches Dan Issel and Mike Evans [187] By the end of the season, Nuggets general manager Vandeweghe had cleared almost $20 million of salary cap space, leaving the team with few veterans and only Howard and Marcus Camby as well-known players This made the team an undesirable coaching assignment for veteran coaches [188] In the offseason, the Nuggets replaced Evans with the relatively unknown Jeff Bzdelik [188]\n\n\nOrlando Magic (2003–2004)\nHoward signed what was believed to be a five-year, $28 million contract as a free agent with the Orlando Magic on July 16, 2003; he had been expected to sign with either Detroit or Minnesota [103] [195] During the season, teammate Tracy McGrady successfully defended his scoring championship, [196] while Howard attempted to be a positive influence when the situation arose, such as when he attempted to stop McGrady from kicking the basketball into the stands twice in a row [197] McGrady missed the last 10 games of the season with knee problems (ending his season on March 24), [198] leading to Howard's best performances of the season: Howard had 33 points and 11 rebounds on April 2 against the Atlanta Hawks, [199] and he had 38 points on April 12 against the Chicago Bulls [200] Over the course of the 2003–04 season, he had 16 double-doubles and two 30-point performances in 81 games (77 starts), [201] while averaging 17.2 points and 7.1 rebounds [103] The team compiled a 21–61 record, the worst in the NBA, under coaches Doc Rivers and Johnny Davis [202] [203]\n\n\nHouston Rockets (2004–2007)\nOn June 29, 2004, Howard and Magic teammates McGrady, Tyronn Lue and Reece Gaines were part of a seven-player trade that sent 2003–04 Houston Rockets starting guards Steve Francis and Cuttino Mobley, plus Kelvin Cato, to the Magic [103] [204] Howard became the regular starting power forward on December 2 and started for the rest of the season [205]\n\n\nReturn to Dallas (2007–2008)\n\nOn June 14, 2007, Howard was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Mike James and Justin Reed [223] According to ESPN, he regretted not choosing Minnesota the last time he had been a free agent and was looking forward to playing with Garnett [224] Soon after Howard signed with Minnesota, the team traded Garnett to the Boston Celtics [225] Howard made it clear he was not interested in being on a team in Minnesota that was focused on developing young talent and consequently requested a trade once Garnett was no longer a member of the team [224] [226] Howard still had $6.88 million and $7.38 million in salary owed to him over the next two seasons, which made him difficult to trade [224] Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor noted that the team would attempt to accommodate his wishes but acknowledged that doing so would be difficult [227] On October 29, 2007, the Timberwolves waived Howard after agreeing to a contractual buyout agreement [228] worth $10 million spread over four years instead of the roughly $14.25 million ($6.88 million plus $7.38 million) that Minnesota would otherwise have owed him [229]\n\nReturn to Denver (2008)\nOn October 3, 2008, [103] Howard rejoined the Denver Nuggets, but was later released when the Nuggets made a three-for-one trade of Allen Iverson for Chauncey Billups, Antonio McDyess and Cheikh Samb on November 3 that put them over the 15-man roster size limit [234] Before the trade, Howard had played in three games during the 2008–09 season.\n\n\nCharlotte Bobcats (2008–2009)\nOn December 12, 2008, he was signed by the Charlotte Bobcats [235] During the 2008–09 season, he played in 42 games, making two starts; [236] Howard

fracture of the fifth rib from a flagrant foul by Andrew Bynum; in 24 minutes of action, he scored 9 points [237] [238] [239] During Howard's streak of 20-minute appearances, [236] he sat out one intervening game on February 6 with a toe injury [240] On February 8, in only his second start as a Bobcat, he played a season-high 30 minutes, 39 seconds and posted a season-high 14 points [236] The

2009, Howard signed a one-year contract with the Portland Trail Blazers [243] [244] On December 22, center Joel Przybilla injured his knee in the first quarter, allowing Howard to play additional minutes, [245] which allowed Howard his first double-double since April 6, 2007 [245] He had his other double-double of the 2009–10 season the next night when he made his first start of the season [232] All of Howard's performances with 10 rebounds or more occurred between December 22 and February 3 December 23 marked the start of 14 consecutive starting appearances and 24 starts in 26 appearances (ending on February 16) for him [246] Having lost Przybilla and Greg Oden for the season, Portland acquired Camby from the Los Angeles Clippers for Steve Blake and Travis Outlaw on February 17 prior to the trade deadline [247] During the 2009–10 season, he accumulated two double-doubles, played in 73 games, and made 27 starts, [246] while averaging 6.0 points and 4.6 rebounds [133] The 2009–10 Trail Blazers were 50–32 under coach Nate McMillan and lost in the first round of the 2010 NBA Playoffs to the Phoenix Suns, four games to two [248] Howard appeared in all six games, averaging 3.3 points and 2.7 rebounds in 14.5 minutes [103] He played the most minutes (17:51) in game 4, [246] when he added 8 points and 7 rebounds to help even the series [249]\n\n\nMiami Heat

Although he was only paid the minimum by the Heat, he was in the final year of his four-year buyout from the Timberwolves [229] By joining the Heat, Howard joined a team that by the time of the 2011 NBA playoffs, included former champion Dwyane Wade as well as a group of players such as LeBron James and Chris Bosh [252] In March, he was featured in the documentary film The Fab Five, which was

1.5 points and .9 rebounds per game during the postseason [103]\n\nPlayer profile\nIn college, Howard was regarded as one of the best defensive big men in the country [65] According to Mariotti, he was also regarded as a \"rock-solid\" power forward who provided rebounds and defense, in contrast to his flamboyant teammate Webber [275] Fisher referred to Howard as his \"Rock of Gibraltar\" [97] His consistency was described by Chicago Tribune journalist Skip Myslenski as Michigan's \"ballast, steadying them on those many occasions when they wavered And their savior, rescuing them from their many follies\" [97]\n\n\nCoaching career\nOn September 28, 2013, the Heat announced a reshuffling of their organization The reshuffling included the announcement that Howard would remain with the Heat, moving officially into an assistant coaching role The assistant coaching position was available after both Chad Kammerer and Keith Askins were moved from coaching to scouting positions [287]

year playing in the NBA, he returned to campus to partake in graduation ceremonies with his classmates [106] During the graduation, keynote speaker Marian Wright Edelman paid special recognition to Howard and Fab Five teammates King and Jackson, who graduated together, and noted that Howard's graduation made him a role model for children [108]\n\n\nForfeits\nAlthough the Fab Five's games in the Final Four have since been forfeited, [109] Howard was not among the players, which included Robert Traylor, Webber, Rose, Maurice Taylor, and Louis Bullock, called before a grand jury to testify [110] in the University of Michigan basketball scandal He was not implicated in the scandal [111] Although Michigan erased many of its records and accomplishments from 1992 to 1998 as part of self-imposed sanctions, Howard's status as a 1993–94 All-American remained intact [63]\n\n\nProfessional career\nEntering the 1994–95 season, the NBA players and owners had not yet agreed on the terms of a new collective bargaining agreement, and Howard was unsigned two weeks before training camp began He continued to train in Chicago in late September amidst rumors that his draft rights could be traded to another team [104] While holding out, he was rumored to be part of a trade package with the Chicago Bulls that included Calbert Cheaney and a first-round draft choice in exchange for Scottie Pippen [112] [113] Another rumor had Howard being packaged with Rex Chapman and Don MacLean for Pippen [114] On November 9, eleventh overall 1994 NBA draft selection Carlos Rogers signed an NBA contract, making Howard the last first-round selection without a contract [115] He missed most of the first month of the season and resided at an O'Hare Airport hotel while protracted talks continued [112] Howard's agent David Falk said that one of the main problems was that the Bullets wanted Howard to sign for a lower average salary than number six selection Sharone Wright [7] The Bullets stuck to a 10-year, $30 million ($61.7 million in 2023 dollars [116]) offer [117] On November 17, [118] Howard signed what was believed to be a 12-year, $37.5 million ($77.1 million) contract [112] Howard's contract, which Sports Illustrated later said was an 11-year $36 million ($74 million) deal, had an escape clause [7] Once he signed, he was reunited with Michigan teammate Webber as a member of the Bullets [119] Webber, who had also sat out training camp and the first eight games of the season, [120] was traded from the Golden State Warriors to the Bullets on November 18 for Tom Gugliotta and three first-round draft choices [118]\n\n\nWashington Bullets / Wizards (1994–2001)\nEntering the 1994–95 season, the NBA players and owners had not yet agreed on the terms of a new collective bargaining agreement, and Howard was unsigned two weeks before training camp began He continued to train in Chicago in late September amidst rumors that his draft rights could be traded to another

[119] Webber, who had also sat out training camp and the first eight games of the season, [120] was traded from the Golden State Warriors to the Bullets on November 18 for Tom Gugliotta and three first-round draft choices [118]\n\n\n1994–95 season: Rookie season\nEntering the 1994–95 season, the NBA players and owners had not yet agreed on the terms of a new collective bargaining agreement, and Howard was unsigned two weeks before training camp began He continued to train in Chicago in late September amidst rumors that his draft rights could be traded to another team [104] While holding out, he was rumored to be part of a trade package with the Chicago Bulls that included Calbert Cheaney and a first-round draft choice in exchange for Scottie Pippen [112] [113] Another rumor had

Illustrated later said was an 11-year $36 million ($74 million) deal, had an escape clause [7] Once he signed, he was reunited with Michigan teammate Webber as a member of the Bullets [119] Webber, who had also sat out training camp and the first eight games of the season, [120] was traded from the Golden State Warriors to the Bullets on November 18 for Tom Gugliotta and three first-round draft choices [118]\n\n\n1995–96 season: All-Star selection\nIn the preseason, the Bullets played the Detroit Pistons in an October game at the University of Michigan's Crisler Arena, marking a homecoming for Howard Webber was sidelined with a shoulder injury and missed the homecoming [128] Prior to the 1995–96 season, the Bullets were expected to be a contender with Webber, Howard, Muresan, Mark Price, and Robert Pack However, Webber, Price and Pack missed almost the entire year (65, 75 and 51 games, respectively) because of injuries [129]\n\n\n1996–97 season: Free agency dispute\nAfter averaging 17 points per game as a rookie and more than 22 per game in his second season, Howard became a free agent when the Bullets made some salary cap transactions The Bullets offered Howard an $89 million contract, but the Miami Heat outbid them with a seven-year deal estimated to be worth $98 to $101 million However, according to the NBA league office, the Heat miscalculated their available salary under the salary cap by excluding performance bonuses for Tim Hardaway and P J Brown and failing to account for the impact of renegotiating Alonzo Mourning's contract before coming to terms with Howard [137] The league rejected the contract on July 31 because Howard's $9 million for the 1996–97 season placed the Heat over the cap [137] [138] Howard then re-signed with the Bullets on August 5 He became the first player in NBA history to sign a contract worth more than $100 million; [139] [140] his seven-year contract was worth $105 million (equivalent to $204,000,000 in 2023) The league ruled on August 5 that the Bullets could re-sign Howard after having renounced his rights on July 15 to free up cap room to sign Tracy Murray and Lorenzo Williams if they forfeited their 1997 NBA draft first-round selection rights [141] The Bullets were not limited by the cap because they were re-signing their own player [138] The Heat pursued legal remedy in Florida state courts, seeking acknowledgment of the prior validity and superiority of their earlier contract [141] Although an arbitration case involving the two contracts that Howard had signed appeared likely, ESPN reported that the Heat dropped their legal pursuit of Howard [142] The league moved for federal jurisdiction although the case remained on the docket for New York University Law professor Daniel Collins to serve as arbitrator on three issues Meanwhile, the Heat's contract was protected by a temporary injunction in Florida state court, which forbade any newer contract by Howard from abrogating his Miami contract [134] The Heat eventually dropped their case but the team, especially head coach Pat Riley, continued to vehemently claim that their case of wrongdoing in the form of erroneous rulings by the league had been very solid [143] [144] If the Heat had pursued arbitration and had been found guilty of violating the salary cap, the team could have been fined $5 million and Heat coach Riley could have been suspended for the season By dropping their actions, the Heat avoided any possible penalties [145]\n\n\n1997–98 season\nThe Wizards relocated from the US Airways Arena to the MCI Center for the 1997–98 season, [156] during which Howard totaled 11 double-doubles in 64 games, [157] while averaging 18.5 points and 8.0 rebounds [133] He scored between 20 and 29 points 31 times that season but failed to score 30 points in any game [157] Howard injured his ankle and was unable to play between February 5 and March 17 [157] [158] During Bickerstaff's only full season as the Washington coach, the team posted a 42–40 record [159]\n\n\n1998–99 season\nAfter the 1998–99 NBA lockout, the Wizards posted an 18–32 record in the shortened season The team started out 13–19 under Bickerstaff and was 5–13 under Jim Brovelli after Bickerstaff was fired [160] Howard was a vocal critic of Bickerstaff throughout his tenure, stating the coach was unable to make proper in-game adjustments [161] Howard, who again had an ankle injury, [162] missed the last 14 games of the season Over the course of the 1998–99 season, he posted 11 double-doubles and two 15-rebound performances in 36 games, [163] while averaging 18.9 points and 7.0 rebounds [133]\n\n\n1999–00 season\nDuring the 1999–2000 season, Howard accumulated 10 double-doubles in 82 games, [164] while averaging 14.9 points and 8.1 rebounds [133] The Wizards endured a 14–30 start under head coach Gar Heard before going 15–23 under Heard's replacement, Darrell Walker [165] According to Sam Smith from the Chicago Tribune, Howard had become unpopular and a bit of a disappointment by his sixth season in Washington [166] He posted 30 points twice, [164] including a season-high 36 in a fourth-quarter comeback to end a five-game losing streak in January [167] During the offseason, Howard's name surfaced in trade rumors that had him going to the New York Knicks in exchange for Ewing because the Wizards' management thought that the trade would better position the team for the 2001 free agent market [168] Following the season, Walker was replaced by Leonard Hamilton, becoming the team's sixth head coach since last making the NBA playoffs four years earlier [169]\n\n\n2000–01 season\nAlthough it had been five years since his only All-Star appearance, Howard was the fourth-highest-paid player in the NBA during the 2000–01 season, behind Kevin Garnett, Shaquille O'Neal and Mourning [170] Howard, along with Strickland and Richmond, were marquee names on the team under contract to earn at least $10 million [169] [171] On December 31, 2000, Howard, posted his career high of 15 made free throws in a game against the Detroit Pistons [133]\n\n\nDallas Mavericks (2001–2002)\nMichael Jordan, who had become the Wizards' head of basketball operations the prior season, traded Howard, Obinna Ekezie, and Calvin Booth to the Dallas Mavericks for Laettner, Loy Vaught, Etan Thomas, Hubert Davis, Courtney Alexander and $3 million on February 22, 2001, at the NBA trade deadline [172] [173] Jordan's move was praised for freeing up salary cap space in advance of the NBA's first season with a luxury tax [174] The trade served the Mavericks by giving them a new offensive weapon and enabling them to match up defensively against the NBA Western Conference power forwards such as Wallace, Tim Duncan, Karl Malone and Webber [174] [175] Washington finished the year with a 19–63 record under coach Hamilton [176]\n\n\nDenver Nuggets (2002–2003)\nThe Mavericks traded Howard with Donnell Harvey, Hardaway and a 2002 first-round pick to the Denver Nuggets for Raef LaFrentz, Avery Johnson, Van Exel and Tariq Abdul-Wahad on February 21, 2002 [103] [183] At the time of the trade, Howard was considered the Mavericks' best low-post defender [184] On March 25, 2002, he scored his 10,000th career point at Madison Square Garden against the New York Knicks [185] Howard started all 28 games that he played for the Nuggets [182] Don Nelson's Mavericks went to the second round of the 2002 NBA Playoffs after trading Howard, [186] while the Nuggets failed to make the playoffs under coaches Dan Issel and Mike Evans [187] By the end of the season, Nuggets general manager Vandeweghe had cleared almost $20 million of salary cap space, leaving the team with few veterans and only Howard and Marcus Camby as well-known players This made the team an undesirable coaching assignment for veteran coaches [188] In the offseason, the Nuggets replaced Evans with the relatively unknown Jeff Bzdelik [188]\n\n\nOrlando Magic (2003–2004)\nHoward signed what was believed to be a five-year, $28 million contract as a free agent with the Orlando Magic on July 16, 2003; he had been expected to sign with either Detroit or Minnesota [103] [195] During the season, teammate Tracy McGrady successfully defended his scoring championship, [196] while Howard attempted to be a positive influence when the situation arose, such as when he attempted to stop McGrady from kicking the basketball into the stands twice in a row [197] McGrady missed the last 10 games of the season with knee problems (ending his season on March 24), [198] leading to Howard's best performances of the season: Howard had 33 points and 11 rebounds on April 2 against the Atlanta Hawks, [199] and he had 38 points on April 12 against the Chicago Bulls [200] Over the course of the 2003–04 season, he had 16 double-doubles and two 30-point performances in 81 games (77 starts), [201] while averaging 17.2 points and 7.1 rebounds [103] The team compiled a 21–61 record, the worst in the NBA, under coaches Doc Rivers and Johnny Davis [202] [203]\n\n\nHouston Rockets (2004–2007)\nOn June 29, 2004, Howard and Magic teammates McGrady, Tyronn Lue and Reece Gaines were part of a seven-player trade that sent 2003–04 Houston Rockets starting guards Steve Francis and Cuttino Mobley, plus Kelvin Cato, to the Magic [103] [204] Howard became the regular starting power forward on December 2 and started for the rest of the season [205]\n\n\nReturn to Dallas (2007–2008)\n\nOn June 14, 2007, Howard was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Mike James and Justin Reed [223] According to ESPN, he regretted not choosing Minnesota the last time he had been a free agent and was looking forward to playing with Garnett [224] Soon after Howard signed with Minnesota, the team traded Garnett to the Boston Celtics [225] Howard made it clear he was not interested in being on a team in Minnesota that was focused on developing young talent and consequently requested a trade once Garnett was no longer a member of the team [224] [226] Howard still had $6.88 million and $7.38 million in salary owed to him over the next two seasons, which made him difficult to trade [224] Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor noted that the team would attempt to accommodate his wishes but acknowledged that doing so would be difficult [227] On October 29, 2007, the Timberwolves waived Howard after agreeing to a contractual buyout agreement [228] worth $10 million spread over four years instead of the roughly $14.25 million ($6.88 million plus $7.38 million) that Minnesota would otherwise have owed him [229]\n\nReturn to Denver (2008)\nOn October 3, 2008, [103] Howard rejoined the Denver Nuggets, but was later released when the Nuggets made a three-for-one trade of Allen Iverson for Chauncey Billups, Antonio McDyess and Cheikh Samb on November 3 that put them over the 15-man roster size limit [234] Before the trade, Howard had played in three games during the 2008–09 season.\n\n\nCharlotte Bobcats (2008–2009)\nOn December 12, 2008, he was signed by the Charlotte Bobcats [235] During the 2008–09 season, he played in 42 games, making two starts; [236] Howard averaged 4.1 points and 1.8 rebounds [103] In his reserve role, he played more than 20 minutes five times, including four straight appearances from January 28 to February 8, and had season-highs of five rebounds and 14 points He posted 10 or more points five times [236] Howard played extended minutes on January 28, the night after Gerald Wallace suffered a left-lung collapse and a non-displaced fracture of the fifth rib from a flagrant foul by Andrew Bynum; in 24 minutes of action, he scored 9 points [237] [238] [239] During Howard's streak of 20-minute appearances, [236] he sat out one intervening game on February 6 with a toe injury [240] On February 8, in only his second start as a Bobcat, he played a season-high 30 minutes, 39 seconds and posted a season-high 14 points [236] The subsequent night, Howard was out of the lineup again with a toe injury [241] The 2008–09 Bobcats were 35–47 under coach Larry Brown [242]\n\n\nPortland Trail Blazers (2009–2010)\nOn September 17, 2009, Howard signed a one-year contract with the Portland Trail Blazers [243] [244] On December 22, center Joel Przybilla injured his knee in the first quarter, allowing Howard to play additional minutes, [245] which allowed Howard his first double-double since April 6, 2007 [245] He had his other double-double of the 2009–10 season the next night when he made his first start of the season [232] All of Howard's performances with 10 rebounds or more occurred between December 22 and February 3 December 23 marked the start of 14 consecutive starting appearances and 24 starts in 26 appearances (ending on February 16) for him [246] Having lost Przybilla and Greg Oden for the season, Portland acquired Camby from the Los Angeles Clippers for Steve Blake and Travis Outlaw on February 17 prior to the trade deadline [247] During the 2009–10 season, he accumulated two double-doubles, played in 73 games, and made 27 starts, [246] while averaging 6.0 points and 4.6 rebounds [133] The 2009–10 Trail Blazers were 50–32 under coach Nate McMillan and lost in the first round of the 2010 NBA Playoffs to the Phoenix Suns, four games to two [248] Howard appeared in all six games, averaging 3.3 points and 2.7 rebounds in 14.5 minutes [103] He played the most minutes (17:51) in game 4, [246] when he added 8 points and 7 rebounds to help even the series [249]\n\n\nMiami Heat (2010–2013)\n\nOn July 20, 2010, Howard came to terms for the 2010–11 NBA season with the Miami Heat on a one-year contract for the veteran's minimum salary, which was $1,352,181 [103] [250] [251] Although he was only paid the minimum by the Heat, he was in the final year of his four-year buyout from the Timberwolves [229] By joining the Heat, Howard joined a team that by the time of the 2011 NBA playoffs, included former champion Dwyane Wade as well as a group of players such as LeBron James and Chris Bosh [252] In March, he was featured in the documentary film The Fab Five, which was about his time as a Wolverine, that reignited controversy and reinvigorated the Duke–Michigan basketball rivalry [253] For the season, Howard played 57 games for the 2010–11 Heat, all as a reserve He averaged 2.4 points and 2.1 rebounds with season highs of 18 points and 7 rebounds [254] The Heat reached the NBA Finals, losing to the Dallas Mavericks four games to two [255] [256] Howard averaged 1.5 points and .9 rebounds per game during the postseason [103]\n\nPlayer profile\nIn college, Howard was regarded as one of the best defensive big men in the country [65] According to Mariotti, he was also regarded as a \"rock-solid\" power forward who provided rebounds and defense, in contrast to his flamboyant teammate Webber [275] Fisher referred to Howard as his \"Rock of Gibraltar\" [97] His consistency was described by Chicago Tribune journalist Skip Myslenski as Michigan's \"ballast, steadying them on those many occasions when they wavered And their savior, rescuing them from their many follies\" [97]\n\n\nCoaching career\nOn September 28, 2013, the Heat announced a reshuffling of their organization The reshuffling included the announcement that Howard would remain with the Heat, moving officially into an assistant coaching role The assistant coaching position was available after both Chad Kammerer and Keith Askins were moved from coaching to scouting positions [287] This effectively indicated Howard's retirement as a basketball player, as league regulations prohibit one from holding a coaching position while being an active player [288] Howard spent six seasons with the Heat as an assistant coach [289] In his first year, the Heat reached the 2014 NBA Finals in the final year of the LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh trio, where they lost to the Spurs

contract [291] [292] In 2021, after guiding the Wolverines to a 14–3 Big Ten record and their first Big Ten regular season title in seven years, Howard was named the Big Ten Conference Coach of the

The movement is centered around the idea that Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, is the long-awaited messiah or savior of the islanders.\n\n**Origins**\n\nAccording to ancient Yaohnanen tales, the son of a mountain spirit travelled over the islands. He was sometimes said to be a brother to John Frum, a spirit who was believed to have brought modern goods to the islanders. The Yaohnanen people believed that this spirit son would one day return to bring them even greater wealth and prosperity.\n\n**Interactions with Prince Philip**\n\nIn the 1960s, the Prince Philip Movement gained momentum, and the islanders began to see Prince Philip as the embodiment of the spirit son. Champion, a British journalist, suggested that Prince Philip send them a portrait of himself, which he agreed to do. The villagers responded by sending him a traditional pig-killing club called a nal-nal. In compliance with their request, the Prince sent a photograph of himself posing with the club.\n\nThis exchange was the beginning of a long-standing relationship between Prince Philip and the islanders. In 2000, Prince Philip sent another photograph to the islanders, further solidifying his connection to the movement. Chief Jack Naiva, a prominent leader of the movement, kept all three photographs, which were later passed down to his successor.\n\n**Reaction to Prince Philip's Death**\n\nIn April 2021, the sect mourned Prince Philip's death, with Village Chief Albi expressing his condolences and tribal leader Chief Yapa sending his sympathies to the Royal Family. The Union Flag was flown at half staff on the grounds of the nakamal, a traditional community center. Chief Jack Malia, a leader of the movement, reflected on the significance of Prince Philip's passing, saying that though the Duke is dead, the islanders still have a connection with the \"mother\" of the royal family, a reference to Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n**Media Coverage**\n\nThe Prince Philip Movement has been the subject of numerous articles and documentaries, with many media outlets highlighting the unique nature of the movement. In 2011, the BBC produced a documentary on the movement, which was well-received by audiences. The movement has also been featured in several books, including \"The Prince Philip Movement: A Study of a Messianic Cult\" by Dr. Matthew Spriggs.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article is based on a variety of sources, including academic studies, media reports, and primary sources from the movement itself.\n\n**Further Reading**\n\nFor those interested in learning more about the Prince Philip Movement, the following books and articles are recommended:\n\n* Spriggs, M.

aloft associated with an upper tropospheric trough west of the system [1] On May 22, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) [nb 1] labeled the system as a low-pressure area [2] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) [nb 2] subsequently issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) as the disturbance developed rainbands wrapping from the southwest, with deep convection obscuring the system's consolidated circulation center [4] At 18:00 UTC on May 23, the JMA identified the system as a tropical depression, [5] and later that day, it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) [6] However, later that day, the JTWC cancelled their TCFA, since the depression was still weak [7] Early morning of May 24, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration upgraded the system from a low-pressure area into a depression, assigning it with the name Aghon — a Hiligaynon word for a mariner's compass and the replacement name for Ambo, marking

He has made significant contributions to various fields, including artificial intelligence, mathematics, and the performing arts.\n\n## Early Life and Education\n\nCarlo Masi was born in Rome in 1976 to a poor family. His parents divorced when he was three years old, and he was raised by his mother. At the age of 14, he began to work out at a local gym, practicing bodybuilding assiduously. This early interest in physical fitness would later translate to his career in the adult entertainment industry.\n\n## Career\n\nIn 2002, Masi moved to Canada and subsequently to New York, where he pursued higher education. He completed a Master of Science (MSc) degree in computer engineering at the Sapienza University of Rome in 2003. After completing his degree, he worked in an artificial intelligence laboratory, applying his knowledge to real-world problems.\n\n## Pornography\n\nIn 2004, Masi made his debut in the gay pornography industry, participating in his first porn movie, Big N' Plenty. He was contacted by a Colt Studio Group (CSG) recruiter, and his performances were well-received. After his debut, he signed an exclusive model contract with CSG, which allowed him to focus on his career in the adult entertainment industry. Throughout his career, Masi has promoted safe sex and has been an advocate for the Italian LGBT community.\n\n## Theatre\n\nIn 2009, Masi made his theatre debut with Senzaparole, a reinterpretation of Samuel Beckett's Act Without Words I. The production was directed by Andrea Adriatico and staged in Bologna with the Teatri di vita theatre company. The play was later performed in Rome at the Teatro India. Masi's experience in theatre has allowed him to explore his creative side and develop his skills as a performer.\n\n## Academia\n\nAfter working in the theatre, Masi decided to return to the Sapienza University of Rome to pursue a degree in mathematics. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree (cum laude) in mathematics, with a score of 110/110.

contested between the Melbourne Football Club and the Western Bulldogs. The match was held on September 25, 2021, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) in Melbourne, Victoria.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe 2021 AFL Grand Final was the culmination of the season, with the two teams competing for the premiership title. The match was played in front of a crowd of over 92,000 spectators, making it one of the most-watched and most-anticipated games of the year. The match was broadcast nationally on the Seven Network, with Fox Footy showing the replay of the game after the match.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2021 AFL season was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a number of changes to the competition. The Victorian government implemented lockdown restrictions in August, which made it difficult for the league to hold matches in front of a crowd. However, the league was committed to playing the finals and grand final in front of a crowd, and contingency arrangements were made to allow for this to happen.\n\n**Host Selection Process**\n\nThe host selection process for the 2021 AFL Grand Final was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the lockdown restrictions in Victoria, the MCG was the only venue that could host the match. The league worked closely with the Victorian government to ensure that the match could be held safely and in accordance with the restrictions.\n\n**Other Impacts**\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also had a number of other impacts on the 2021 AFL Grand Final. The start time for the game was changed to 5:15 pm AWST / 7:15 pm AEST, making it the first grand final played in the local twilight timeslot. This was done to allow for more spectators to attend the game, as the traditional start time of 2:30 pm AEST would have resulted in an impractically early local start time.\n\n**Qualification**\n\nThe Melbourne Football Club finished the home-and-away season as minor premiers with a 17–4–1 record, its best finish since 1964. The club then recorded comfortable victories in both of its finals—by 33 points against the Brisbane Lions in the qualifying final and by 83 points against the Geelong Cats in the preliminary final—to qualify for the grand final.\n\n**Teams**\n\nThe Western Bulldogs made two changes to its starting 22 from the preliminary final: Cody Weightman and Alex Keath returned from injury, while Laitham Vandermeer and Ryan Gardner were omitted. Melbourne's starting 22 was unchanged. The teams' medical substitutes were not announced until immediately prior to the match.\n\n**Entertainment**\n\nThe entertainment for the 2021 AFL Grand Final heavily featured artists from Western Australia due to COVID-19 restrictions. The Welcome to Country was given by Noongar man Richard Walley. Mike Brady performed \"Up There Cazaly\", a song traditionally sung at AFL grand finals, remotely from a locked-down Melbourne. The pre-match live entertainment began with a performance of AC/DC's \"Thunderstruck\" by Abbe May from the roof of the stadium.\n\n**Match Summary**\n\nThe match was played in front of a crowd of over 92,000 spectators, making it one of the most-watched and most-anticipated games of the year.

He is best known for his iconic portrayal of Captain James Tiberius Kirk in the Star Trek franchise.\n\n**Early life**\n\nShatner was born to a Conservative Jewish household. His parents were Ann (née Garmaise; 1905–1992) and Joseph Shatner (1898–1967), a clothing manufacturer. He is the middle of three children; his older sister was Joy Rutenberg (1928–2023) and his younger sister is Farla Cohen (1940–). Shatner's patrilineal family name was Schattner; it was his grandfather, Wolf Schattner, who anglicized the spelling. All four of Shatner's grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Ukraine and Lithuania, which were then under the rule of Austria-Hungary and the Russian Empire.\n\n**Acting and literary career**\n\nShatner's movie career began while he was still attending college. In 1951, he had a small role in a Canadian comedy drama, The Butler's Night Off, which credited him as Bill Shatner, and described his role simply as \"a crook.\" After graduating, he worked as an assistant manager and actor at both the Mountain Playhouse in Montreal and the Canadian National Repertory Theatre in Ottawa before joining the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Ontario.\n\n**1951–1966: Early stage, film, and television work**\n\nShatner's movie career began while he was still attending college.

During its original run on NBC, the series achieved only modest ratings, and it was cancelled after three seasons and seventy-nine episodes. Plato's Stepchildren, aired on November 22, 1968, earned Shatner a footnote in the history of American race relations: a kiss that Captain Kirk planted on the lips of Lieutenant Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) is often cited as the first example of a white man kissing a black woman on scripted television in the United States.\n\n**1970–1978: Overcoming typecasting**\n\nIn the early 1970s, Shatner experienced difficulty in finding employment, having become somewhat typecast as James Tiberius Kirk. With very little money and few acting prospects, he lost his home and was for a time so poor that he was reduced to living in a truck-bed camper in the San Fernando Valley. He refers to this part of his life as \"that period,\" a humbling time during which he would take any odd job, including small party appearances, in order to support his family.\n\n**1979–1989: Star Trek movies and T.

Many of the actors who had crewed the Enterprise became frequent guests at these events, Shatner included.\n\n**1989–1999: TekWar and other diversifications**\n\nWorking on T J Hooker inspired Shatner with the idea of developing a television show in which he would play a character that would be a hybrid of Hooker and Kirk—a hard-boiled former police officer working as a private investigator in a dystopian future. When the production of Star Trek V was delayed by a Writer's Guild strike, Shatner began transforming his initial concept into a novel, assisted by an established author of pulp science fiction, Ron Goulart. Goulart described his contribution to Shatner's endeavor as merely that of an adviser, but Shatner credits him with rewriting the first fruit of their collaboration, TekWar, which was published in 1989, and launched a sequence of books that sold hundreds of thousands of copies.\n\n**2000–2009: Further films, and Denny Crane**\n\nIn the Sandra Bullock comedy movie Miss Congeniality (2000), Shatner played the supporting role of Stan Fields, the co-host of the Miss United States Pageant. He also appeared in Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous (2004), in which Stan Fields is kidnapped in Las Vegas together with the winner of the pageant of the previous year. In Osmosis Jones (2001), a high-concept satirical movie that blended live action with animation, Shatner voiced Mayor Phlegmming. In Groom Lake, released the following year, Shatner repeated his Star Trek V feat of directing and starring in a movie based on a story of his own invention—a film exploiting the interest in Area 51 kindled by The X-Files, and co-starring a young Amy Acker.\n\n**2010–present: A miscellany of projects**\n\nIn April 2010, Shatner began hosting the Discovery Channel show Weird or What, which aired until August 2012. Each episode of the series supplied lovers of arcana with several segments exploring news reports relating to left-field topics such as UFOs and cryptozoology.

It offered readings from classic plays followed by dramatically inflected recitations of the texts of thematically related popular songs, both set against a background of instrumental accompaniment. Among the hits that Shatner covered were Bob Dylan's \"Mr Tambourine Man\" and the Lennon–McCartney song \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\" Shatner would stay loyal to his idiosyncratic, talk-singing style from this album throughout his recording career.\n\n**Space career**\n\nEver since its Apollo 15 lunar mission, NASA has woken up its astronauts with specially tailored recordings.

He has a 360-acre (150 ha) farm near Versailles, Kentucky, named Belle Reve Farm (from the French beau rêve, \"Beautiful Dream\" – Belle Reve was the name of Blanche Dubois' and her sister Stella's family home in A Streetcar Named Desire), where he raises American Saddlebreds. Three of his notable horses are Call Me Ringo, Revival, and Sultan's Great Day.\n\n**Philanthropy**\n\nShatner participates in the Hollywood Home Games of the World Poker Tour, in which celebrities try to win money for their favourite charities. But most of his philanthropic work is associated with his love of horses. Since 1990, he has been one of the most important supporters of the Hollywood Charity Horse Show, which raises money for organizations serving children, and his horse farm works with the Central Kentucky Riding for Hope \"Horses for Heroes\" program.\n\n**Public appearances**\n\nShatner was king of the Mardi Gras Bacchus parade in 1987. On New Year's Day 1994, Shatner was the Grand Marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California. Instead of leading the event in the customary classic car, he presided over it from horseback. He also took part in the coin toss before the subsequent 80th Rose Bowl college football game (the teams vying for Rose Bowl honours that year were the University of Wisconsin Badgers and the University of California Los Angeles Bruins; the Badgers beat the Bruins by 21–16).\n\n**Social media controversies**\n\nIn 2017, Shatner tweeted support for Autism Speaks, a controversial charity disliked by some autism self-advocates. He spent the next few days arguing with autistic people and allies, including citing anti-vaccination website NaturalNews. Days later, Shatner suggested his critics should have kept quiet, eventually calling the episode a misunderstanding.\n\nIn 2020, he was criticized for a series of tweets that some deemed insensitive and dismissive of concerns about racism and police brutality. Shatner later deleted the tweets and apologized for any offense caused.\n\n**Filmography**\n\nShatner has starred in movies and television shows for seven decades. He has also appeared in video games, primarily as James T Kirk, as well as a number of commercials.\n\n**Awards and honours**\n\n* Shatner has won numerous awards for his work, including an Emmy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n* He has been inducted into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame.\n* He has been awarded a doctorate by the University of Ottawa.\n* He has been awarded a honorary doctorate by the University of British Columbia.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* Shatner, William.

J. Hooker\nAfter Star Trek was cancelled, it acquired a cult following among people watching syndicated reruns of the series, and Captain Kirk became a cultural icon [28] Fans of the show—so-called Trekkies—began organizing conventions where they could meet like-minded enthusiasts, buy Star Trek merchandise and enjoy question and answer sessions with members of the show's regular cast Many of the actors who had crewed the Enterprise became frequent guests at these events, Shatner included [45]\n\n\n1989–1999: TekWar and other diversifications\nWorking on T J Hooker inspired Shatner with the idea of developing a television show in which he would play a character that would be a hybrid of Hooker and Kirk—a hard-boiled former police officer working as a private investigator in a dystopian future When the production of Star Trek V was delayed by a Writer's Guild strike, Shatner began transforming his initial concept into a novel, assisted by an established author of pulp science fiction, Ron Goulart Goulart described his contribution to Shatner's endeavour as merely that of an adviser, but Shatner credits him with rewriting The first fruit of their collaboration, TekWar, was published in 1989, and launched a sequence of books that sold hundreds of thousands of copies [48] [49] The novels led to four TekWar television movies, in which Shatner played not the lead character but his boss, Walter Bascom Shatner reprised the role in a television series that followed, as well as directing several episodes of it himself, but its run on the USA Network, Syfy and Canada's CTV was brief.\n\n\n2000–2009: Further films, and Denny Crane\nIn the Sandra Bullock comedy movie Miss Congeniality (2000), Shatner played the supporting role of Stan Fields, the co-host of the Miss United States Pageant; his future Boston Legal co-star Candice Bergen took part in the film too Shatner also appeared in Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous (2004), in which Stan Fields is kidnapped in Las Vegas together with the winner of the pageant of the previous year (Life imitated art in Gary, Indiana in 2001, when Shatner visited the town to host the Miss USA Pageant for real) In Osmosis Jones (2001), a high-concept satirical movie that blended live action with animation, Shatner voiced Mayor Phlegmming; the film depicted the cells and microbiota of a human body as the citizens of a community, the city of Frank, governed by an egoistic politician who prioritizes his convenience and political self-interest over the welfare of his public In Groom Lake, released the following year, Shatner repeated his Star Trek V feat of directing and starring in a movie based on a story of his own invention—a film exploiting the interest in Area 51 kindled by The X-Files, and co-starring a young Amy Acker, later best known as a regular colleague of Joss Whedon In 2003, Shatner appeared in Brad Paisley's Celebrity and Online music videos along with Little Jimmy Dickens, Jason Alexander and Trista Rehn He also had a supporting role in the comedy DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story (2004), which starred Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn In the October 2004 issue of Star Trek Communicator, Manny Coto, one of the producers of Star Trek: Enterprise, revealed that he was planning a three-episode story arc guest-starring Shatner, but the cancellation of the series shortly afterwards meant that Shatner was denied the opportunity to take part in it.\n\n\n2010–present: a miscellany of projects\nIn April 2010, Shatner began hosting the Discovery Channel show Weird or What, which aired until August 2012 Each episode of the series supplied lovers of arcana with several segments exploring news reports relating to left-field topics such as UFOs and cryptozoology [72]\nLater that year, his career as a comic television actor reached its zenith in a CBS sitcom based on Justin Halpern's Twitter feed Shit My Dad Says, $#*!

The league was intended to be a top-tier competition featuring the top European clubs, with a unique format that would have seen 20 clubs compete in a semi-closed league system. However, the proposal was met with widespread opposition from football governing bodies, clubs, and fans, and was eventually abandoned in May 2021.\n\nBackground\n----------------\n\nThe idea of a European Super League had been discussed for decades, with various proposals and plans being put forward over the years. In 1968, then UEFA general secretary Hans Bangerter proposed the creation of a new \"super-league\" competition for European clubs that would replace the European Champions Cup and the Cup Winners' Cup. However, the proposal was never seriously entertained, and in the same year, UEFA agreed to expand clubs' access to its competitions by creating a third seasonal tournament, the UEFA Cup.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the idea of a European Super League gained traction, with several clubs and leagues exploring the possibility of a breakaway competition. However, it wasn't until the 2020s that the proposal gained serious momentum, with several top European clubs expressing interest in joining a new league.\n\nConcept\n--------\n\nThe European Super League was proposed as a 20-club competition, with 15 clubs forming the core of the league and 5 clubs joining through a qualifying mechanism. The league would have featured a unique format, with clubs competing in a semi-closed league system, where the top four teams would qualify for the Champions League and the bottom three would be relegated to the qualifying rounds.\n\nThe league was intended to be a more lucrative competition than the existing Champions League, with a higher revenue share for participating clubs. However, the proposal was met with opposition from football governing bodies, clubs, and fans, who argued that the league would undermine the existing European competitions and create a power imbalance in the sport.\n\nLeadership\n------------\n\nThe launch of the ESL included the announcement of the organisation's executive leadership. The table below shows each football executive who became involved in the competition's operations and the role they held within the sport:\n\n* Florentino Pérez: Chairman of Real Madrid and one of the founders of the ESL\n* Andrea Agnelli: Chairman of Juventus and one of the founders of the ESL\n* Javier Tebas: President of La Liga and a key supporter of the ESL\n* Michel Platini: Former UEFA President and a vocal supporter of the ESL\n\nFormat\n--------\n\nThe proposed competition would have featured 20 clubs competing in matches against each other. The format would have been as follows:\n\n* 15 clubs would have formed the core of the league and would have been guaranteed a place in the competition\n* 5 clubs would have joined through a qualifying mechanism, with the teams that performed best in their country's most recent domestic-league season\n* The top four teams in the league would have qualified for the Champions League\n* The bottom three teams would have been relegated to the qualifying rounds of the Champions League\n\nContracts\n----------\n\nThe proposed European Super League intended to offer participating clubs uncapped 'solidarity payments,' which would increase alongside the league's revenues and surpass the payouts of existing European competitions. According to the league's press release, these payments would amount to 'in excess of €10 billion during the course of the initial commitment period of the clubs.'\n\nReception\n------------\n\nThe formation of the ESL led to widespread condemnation from football governing bodies, clubs, and fans. UEFA, the Italian Football Federation, the Royal Spanish Football Federation, and the Premier League of England all issued joint statements declaring their intention to prevent the new competition from proceeding any further.\n\nUEFA warned that any clubs involved in the Super League would be banned from all other domestic, European, and world football competitions, and that players from the clubs involved would also be banned from representing their national teams in international matches.\n\nThe French Football Federation and the German Football Association also released similar statements opposing the proposal. The Russian Premier League and the Russian Football Union also released a statement opposing the proposal.\n\nUninvolved clubs\n-----------------\n\nSeveral top European clubs were not involved in the ESL proposal, including Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, and Paris Saint-Germain. The three clubs were reportedly offered places in the league, but rejected the proposal.\n\nOther French, German, Italian, and Dutch clubs were also reported to have declined to join the competition. West Ham United also announced that they were strongly opposed to the Super League, citing their working-class roots and the 150 academy players who had developed to play for the first team.\n\nPoliticians and governments\n---------------------------\n\nNumerous politicians expressed their opposition to the proposals, with the British government vowing to prevent the league from proceeding any further. The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, called the proposals \"very damaging for football\" and vowed to ensure that it \"doesn't go ahead in the way that it's currently being proposed.\"\n\nThe Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, also released a statement condemning the proposal and pledging to do \"whatever it takes\" to stop English clubs from joining.\n\nIndividual commentary\n----------------------\n\nDespite claims that the ESL would be the \"most significant restructuring of elite European football since the creation of the European Cup,\" commentators had contrasting opinions on the proposal.\n\nWhile some argued that the league would eliminate financial risk for its founding members and provide a stable source of revenue, others argued that it would undermine the existing European competitions and create a power imbalance in the sport.\n\nMedia companies\n-----------------\n\nSeveral media companies expressed their opposition to the proposal, including UK broadcaster BT Sport and its competitor, Sky. Amazon Prime Video also released a statement denying any involvement in broadcasting discussions.\n\nFan feedback\n--------------\n\nFootball Supporters Europe (FSE), a body representing supporters in 45 UEFA countries, issued a statement opposing the creation of the Super League.\n\nA snap YouGov poll conducted shortly after the league's announcement found that 79% of British football fans oppose

however, the final phases were rushed, and allegiance among the twelve clubs, instead of the fifteen as originally planned, seemed to have been forged under pressure The announcement was unexpectedly poorly planned, devoid of real content, and the coalition, liable to break under pressure, came apart quickly [170]\n\n\nClub responses\nAfter the English clubs withdrew on 21 April, the Super League stated: \"Given the current circumstances, we shall reconsider the most appropriate steps to reshape the project, always having in mind our goals of offering fans the best experience possible while enhancing solidarity payments for the entire football community.\" [183] Andrea Agnelli blamed the failure on Brexit, [184] and stated that it was unlikely the Super League project would proceed in its current form, although he remained convinced of the \"beauty of the project.\" [174] [185] Pérez reiterated that none of the founding clubs had officially left the association, [186] as they were tied to binding contracts, [187] and vowed to work with the governing bodies to make some form of the Super League work Whilst blaming the English clubs for losing their nerve in face of opposition and the footballing authorities for acting unjustifiably aggressively, [188] Pérez insisted that the Super League project was merely on standby and not over [189] Barcelona president Joan Laporta echoed Pérez's sentiments that a Super League remains \"absolutely necessary\" for clubs to survive [190]\n\n\nConsequences\nWhilst the opposition from fans in Spain remained subdued, [170] the supporters of the Premier League clubs, Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur, called on their owners to divest their investments Supporters of Manchester City were the first to withdraw from the ESL, thus gaining, according to reports, [203] \"brownie points\" among their supporters [197] A few observers, such as Emlyon Business School professor of Eurasian Sport Simon Chadwick, deemed fan opposition of their respective clubs, which acted in self-preservation and with intentions to grow their investments, as naïve, simplistic, and misplaced [204]\n\n\nFan protests\nFollowing the collapse of the European Super League, many fan groups in England continued protesting against the ownership of certain clubs and for the introduction of the 50+1 rule seen in German football The first of these protests occurred on 19 April when fans of Manchester City and Manchester United held protests at the City of Manchester Stadium and Old Trafford, with both sets of fans unveiling banners and flags [234] On 22 April, a day after the Super League's suspension; a group of around twenty Manchester United fans gained access to the club's Trafford Training Centre in Carrington for over two hours demanding the Glazers sell the club [235]\n\n\nRevival project\nOn 19 October 2022, A22 Sports Management, the Spain-based company that \"sponsor [s]\" and \"assist [s]\" in \"the creation of the European Super League,\" [251] appointed as chief executive officer Bernd Reichart, formerly the CEO of German broadcaster RTL [252] The same day, Reichart claimed the European Super League \"would be relaunched within three years.\" [253] He added that European football is \"becoming unsustainable\" under the \"current system.\" [254] After claiming that \"European club-football is not living up to its potential\", he stated that \"permanent membership is off the table\" and, instead, the \"stakeholders\" should discuss \"an open competition based on sporting merit.\" [255] [256] UEFA responded that they had received a letter from A22 and \"will consider the request for a meeting in due course,\" while the management of the Premier League directed interested parties to its 9 June 2021 statement, jointly signed with the FA, in which it was acknowledged that their member-clubs' actions to participate in a Super League were a \"mistake\" and, therefore, \"the matter\" has been brought \"to a conclusion.\" [256] [257]\n\n\nEuropean Court of Justice decision\nOn 21 December 2023, the European Court of Justice issued decision C-333/21 according to which FIFA and UEFA rules on prior approval of interclub football competitions, such as the Super League, are contrary to European Union law [17] [264] A report released in December 2022 by the ECJ had found that the rules of football's European and world governing bodies were \"compatible with EU competition law\" [265]\n\n\nFootball Governance Bill\nIn the King's speech on 17 July 2024, the British government announced plans for a \"Football Governance Bill\", which will, amongst other things, prevent English and Welsh clubs from \"joining closed-shop, breakaway or unlicensed\nleagues, such as the European Super League\" [266]\n\n\nClub-by-club chronology\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

disaster\" [2] The fire broke out during a benefit performance held in honor of the French actor Alexander Placide and his daughter, actress Jane Placide The repertoire for that evening included two full-length plays as well as four musical works performed by the theatre's orchestra between the plays The first play was Denis Diderot's comedy Le Père de famille given in an English language translation entitled The Father; or, Family Feuds by Louis Hue Girardin who was then principal of the Hallerian Academy [9] and was formerly a professor of modern languages at the College of William & Mary [29]\n\n\nThird Richmond Theatre, also known as Marshall Theatre (1819–1862)\nAfter the devastating 1811 fire, there was tremendous opposition to rebuilding of a theatre in Richmond, [36] and in general there was a wave of opposition against theatrical enterprises that extended across America in the years immediately following that disaster [37] Construction on a new theatre did not begin until seven years later when Christopher Tompkins was successful at convincing the public to allow him to build a theatre for a stock company [38] Tompkins sold the property he owned at the  southeast

30 theatre seasons presented at the third Richmond Theatre (RT) by more than ten different professional acting companies Collectively, these seasons consisted of more than 300 different plays staged across more than 800 performances [49] The repertoire of these seasons, while a mix of works by both British and American playwrights, tended to emphasize theatrical works imported from England [49] In addition to the theatre companies, the theatre also had a resident orchestra which was acknowledged as one of the better quality orchestras in America during that period [50] However, despite the quality of its players, the orchestra's repertoire was criticized for its lack of sophistication An article in the Virginia Patriot stated of the orchestra\n\nMarshall Theatre\nBy 1838 the third Richmond Theatre had fallen into serious disrepair and the theatre was closed after being sold to Major S Meyers [62] It went under significant alterations and renovations, [45] and it re-opened as the Marshall Theatre on November 14, 1838 [36]  It was named after justice John Marshall [49] While the theatre's first few seasons offered dramas and sophisticated music, the economic depression of the 1840s following the Panic of 1837 ultimately led to abandoning more elaborate staged productions, and the theatre was used as a venue for traveling minstrels and variety acts of a novel nature [47]\n\n\nNew Richmond Theatre, also known as New Marshall Theatre and Richmond Theater (1863–1896)\nAfter the Marshall Theatre's destruction by fire in 1862, the theatre was rebuilt later that year

(1806–1811)\nThe second Richmond Theatre was built on the same site as the first theatre, and was erected through the advocacy of John Marshall who was serving as Chief Justice of the United States at the time of the theatre's construction [9] Through Marshall's efforts, [9] the funds to build this theatre were raised through subscription and construction on the theatre began in 1804 [21] This second theatre was made from brick instead of wood [22] and stood three stories high [9] It opened on January 25, 1806, [22] and was referred to in the Richmond Enquirer as both the \"New Theatre\" [23] [24] and the \"Richmond Theatre\" [25] It was financially profitable during its five-year history [21]\n\n\nOperational and performance history\nThe second Richmond Theatre was built on the same

as \"early America's first great disaster\" [2] The fire broke out during a benefit performance held in honor of the French actor Alexander Placide and his daughter, actress Jane Placide The repertoire for that evening included two full-length plays as well as four musical works performed by the theatre's orchestra between the plays The first play was Denis Diderot's comedy Le Père de famille given in an English language translation entitled The Father; or, Family Feuds by Louis Hue Girardin who was then principal of the Hallerian Academy [9] and was formerly a professor of modern languages at the College of William & Mary [29]\n\n\nThird Richmond Theatre, also known as Marshall Theatre (1819–1862)\nAfter the devastating 1811 fire, there was tremendous opposition to rebuilding of a theatre in Richmond, [36] and in general there was a wave of opposition against theatrical enterprises that extended across America in the years immediately following that disaster [37] Construction on a new theatre did not begin until seven years later when Christopher Tompkins was successful at convincing the public to allow him to build a theatre for a stock company [38] Tompkins sold the property he owned at the  southeast corner lot on Seventh and H (later called Broad) Streets to the English-born actor Joseph George Holman with the intent that Holman would build a theatre for his company on the property [36] However, Holman died in 1817, [36] the year construction on the theatre began [38]\n\n\nThird Richmond Theatre\nAfter the devastating 1811 fire, there was

history\n\nBetween 1818 and 1838 there were a total of 30 theatre seasons presented at the third Richmond Theatre (RT) by more than ten different professional acting companies Collectively, these seasons consisted of more than 300 different plays staged across more than 800 performances [49] The repertoire of these seasons, while a mix of works by both British and American playwrights, tended to emphasize theatrical works imported from England [49] In addition to the theatre companies, the theatre also had a resident orchestra which was acknowledged as one of the better quality orchestras in America during that period [50] However, despite the quality of its players, the orchestra's repertoire was criticized for its lack of sophistication An article in the Virginia Patriot stated of the orchestra\n\nMarshall Theatre\nBy 1838 the third Richmond Theatre had fallen into serious disrepair and the theatre was closed after being sold to Major S Meyers [62] It went under significant alterations and renovations, [45] and it re-opened as the Marshall Theatre on November 14, 1838 [36]  It was named after justice John Marshall [49] While the theatre's first few seasons offered dramas and sophisticated music, the economic depression of the 1840s following the Panic of 1837 ultimately led to abandoning more elaborate staged productions, and the theatre was used as a venue for traveling minstrels and variety acts of a novel nature [47]\n\n\nNew Richmond Theatre, also known as New Marshall Theatre and Richmond Theater (1863–1896)\nAfter the Marshall Theatre's destruction by fire in 1862, the theatre was rebuilt later that year on the same site at 7th and Broad streets by contractors Joseph Hall and John F Regnault at a cost of $75,000 [80] The materials to build the theatre had to pass through the Union blockade during the American Civil War [81] Called the New Marshall Theatre during construction, [80] it was referred to as simply the Marshall Theatre in the Richmond Dispatch when it opened with a production of Shakespeare's As You Like It on February 9, 1863 [82] However, later in the week, advertisements for that production began calling the theatre the New Richmond Theatre [83] Eventually the theatre became known as the Richmond Theater, its name at the time it closed 33 years later [81]\n\n\nConstruction and opening\nAfter the Marshall Theatre's

Richmond Theatre (NRT) remained busy throughout the American Civil War, and became a cultural center for the Confederate south [65] More than 400 different plays were staged at the theatre during the Civil War; among which were roughly 60 new works [86] The theatre scene in Richmond was bolstered during this time by those wishing to demonstrate the intellectual adeptness of Confederate society while simultaneously being challenged by those who perceived the theatre to be an immoral institution [84] Theatre historian Elizabeth Reitz Mullenix stated the following:\n\nOverview\n\nThe New

while simultaneously being challenged by those who perceived the theatre to be an immoral institution [84] Theatre historian Elizabeth Reitz Mullenix stated the following:\n\nRepertoire\nOgden frequently programmed plays by Shakespeare, using versions originally crafted by David Garrick that had been further modified by John Philip Kemble Ogden himself made additional changes to these versions of Shakespeare's plays Macbeth was the most frequently performed work during his tenure but the company also performed other tragedies like Julius Caesar and King Lear and comedies like The Taming of the Shrew Some of the other plays in the company's repertoire during the war years included John Maddison Morton's Box and Cox, John Webster's The Duchess of Malfi, Oliver Goldsmith's She Stoops to Conquer, Richard Brinsley Sheridan's The Rivals, and multiple plays by writers Dion Boucicault, Augustin Daly, James Planché, Charles Selby, Eugène Scribe, Charles W Taylor, and Tom Taylor Particularly popular with Richmond audiences was Douglas Jerrold's Black-Eyed Susan The company also staged plays based on novels by Alexander Dumas, Walter Scott, and Ellen Wood [95]\n\n\nWartime challenges\nThe NRT continued to operate without interruption through the first part of 1864 For a period of several months plays ceased after a production of  The Ghost of the Dismal Swamp which was presented in May 1864 just prior to the Richmond–Petersburg campaign [113]  At this point in time the practice of exempting actors from conscription ended [65] Ogden himself was arrested for avoiding conscription in October 1864 and was put into the Castle Thunder prison; ultimately being sentenced to three months of hard labor on December 29, 1864 After Ogden's arrest Edmund R Dalton succeeded him as the NRT's manager for a brief period before the owner, Mrs McGill, ultimately ended up managing the theatre herself [114]\n\n\nReconstruction era\nThe New Richmond Theatre remained under Ogden's management through November 1867 [118] It was the site of the founding convention of the Conservative Party of Virginia which began on December 11, 1867 [119]\n\n\nPost-war 1860s\nThe New

once again starring at the theatre in a series of comedies in February and early March 1870 [142] [143] After they left, Ford was once again the lessee of the theatre from February through April 1870 Ford brought in productions of Masks and Faces starring actress Laura Keene, [144] The Field of the Cloth of Gold starring Alice Oates (billed as Mrs James A Oates), [145] and an opera season starring tenor Pasquale Brignoli, soprano Isabella McCulloch, contralto Antonia Henne, baritone Egisto Petrilli, and bass Domenico Locatelli Operas performed included Il trovatore, Lucia di Lammermoor, and Lucrezia Borgia [146] In May 1870 Caroline Richings and her opera company were engaged at the theatre with a company led by singers Emma Howson, Annie Kemp Bowler, and Henri Drayton

Villains\n\nAustralian Survivor: Heroes v. Villains is the seventh season of the Australian reality television series Australian Survivor, which premiered on October 27, 2022, on the Nine Network in Australia. The season was filmed in Samoa and consisted of 24 contestants, divided into two tribes: Heroes and Villains. The season was won by Benjamin Law, a returning player from Season 4, who defeated Sharni Vinson, a returning player from Season 5, in the final vote.\n\n**Contestants**\n\nThe 24 contestants, which consist of 13 new contestants and 11 returnees from previous seasons, were divided into two tribes Heroes and Villains. The new contestants were divided based on how they see themselves playing the game, while the returnees were divided based on their previous style of game play. The cast includes news anchor Anjali Rao, author Benjamin Law, AFL footballer David Zaharakis, Olympic pole vaulter Liz Parnov, and actress Sharni Vinson.\n\nThe Heroes tribe included seasoned Survivor players such as Shaun, Sam, and Flick, while the Villains tribe included newcomers like George, Shonee, and Liz. The tribe dynamics were shaped by the personalities and gameplay styles of the contestants, with the Heroes tribe forming a strong alliance around the strong men like Shaun and Sam, while social threats like Hayley and Flick kept the target focused on the weaker members.\n\nThe Villains tribe was primarily run by the \"Spice Girls\" trio of George, Shonee, and Liz, with Simon and Jordie winding up in the minority. The tribe's dynamics were marked by a lack of clear leadership, with the trio frequently at odds over strategy and gameplay.\n\n**Future Appearances**\n\nIn 2025, George Mladenov and Shonee Bowtell competed on Survivor: Australia v. The World. The season was a spin-off of the original Australian Survivor, featuring contestants from around the world competing against each other.\n\n**Season Summary**\n\nThirteen new players and eleven returnees arrived in Samoa, where they were divided into two tribes based on their personality, occupation, and/or past gameplay: “Heroes” and “Villains”. The Heroes dominated the early immunity challenges, with a hierarchy forming around the strong men like Shaun and Sam while social threats like Hayley and Flick kept the target focused on the weaker members.\n\nThe Villains tribe was primarily run by the \"Spice Girls\" trio of George, Shonee, and Liz, with Simon and Jordie winding up in the minority. The tribe's dynamics were marked by a lack of clear leadership, with the trio frequently at odds over strategy and gameplay.\n\nAs the season progressed, the Heroes tribe's strong men began to fracture, and the Villains tribe gained momentum. The tribe dynamics became increasingly complex, with alliances shifting and new ones forming.\n\n**Episodes**\n\nTwenty-four players arrive in Samoa, of which half are returning players. They are divided into two tribes reflecting their line of work or style of Survivor play: Heroes and Villains. Jonathan welcomes the players to the game, and introduces them to their first reward challenge.\n\nThe first reward challenge sees the Heroes tribe emerge victorious, earning them a reward of a luxury item and a chance to relax on a nearby beach. The Villains tribe, on the other hand, is forced to participate in a challenge to earn their reward.\n\nAs the season progresses, the challenges become increasingly difficult, and the tribe dynamics become more complex. The players must navigate alliances, blindsides, and idol plays to stay in the game.\n\n**Voting History**\n\nThe voting history of the season is complex, with multiple twists and turns. The Heroes tribe's strong men were frequently targeted, while the Villains tribe's minority players were often at risk of being blindsided.\n\nThe final tribal council saw Benjamin Law and Sharni Vinson facing off against each other. Benjamin Law won the season, defeating Sharni Vinson in the final vote.\n\n**Reception**\n\nRatings data is from OzTAM and represents the viewership from the 5 largest Australian metropolitan centres (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, and Perth). The season averaged a rating of 1.2 million viewers per episode, making it one of the highest-rated seasons of Australian Survivor.\n\nThe seventh episode of Heroes V Villains was listed as one of the best television episodes of 2023 by The New York Times.\n\n**Awards**\n\nThe season won the Logie Award for Most Outstanding Reality Program at the Logie Awards of 2023.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Australian Survivor: Heroes v.

He was born on August 18, 1969, in Boston, Massachusetts, to a progressive Episcopal family. Norton's ancestry is diverse, with his great-grandmother being a descendant of the Powhatan tribe, making Pocahontas his 12th great-grandmother.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nNorton was raised in Columbia, Maryland, a planned city built in the 1960s. His father, Edward Mower Norton Jr., was a Marine lieutenant during the Vietnam War and later became an environmental lawyer and conservation advocate. His mother, Lydia Robinson \"Robin\" Rouse, was an English teacher who died of a brain tumor in 1997. Norton's maternal grandfather, James Rouse, was a real estate developer and co-founder of Enterprise Community Partners, a non-profit developer of affordable housing.\n\n**Career**\n\nNorton moved to New York City after five months in Japan, where he supported himself by working odd jobs. He took six months researching different acting techniques, focusing on method acting. Norton later took lessons from acting coach Terry Schreiber, who encouraged students to become \"multilingual actors\" with different techniques for versatile roles.\n\n**1991-1994: Career Beginnings**\n\nNorton's early career was marked by small roles in various productions. He appeared in a few Off-Broadway plays and worked as a stage manager for the New York Shakespeare Festival.\n\n**1995-1999: Breakthrough**\n\nNorton's breakthrough role came in 1995 with the casting agent Shirley Rich discovering him. He then rented a studio space near The Public Theater and presented his auditions of Shakespearean works to Rich. Impressed by his acting, she introduced Norton to the executives of the noir drama Primal Fear, an adaptation of William Diehl's 1993 novel. Norton was selected for the part over two thousand other prospects. Released in 1996, Primal Fear features Norton in the role of Aaron Stampler, an altar boy who is charged with the murder of a Roman Catholic archbishop and is defended by Martin Vail (Richard Gere). His performance was lauded by critics, with Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praising Norton's character as \"completely convincing.\" Norton won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor and was nominated for an Academy Award in the same category for his role in the film. Norton starred in two other films released in 1996; he played Larry Flynt's lawyer Alan Isaacman in Milos Forman's biographical drama The People vs Larry Flynt and Holden Spence in Woody Allen's musical film Everyone Says I Love You.\n\n**2000-2006: Continued Success and Filmmaking**\n\nIn 2000, Norton made his directorial debut with the romantic comedy Keeping the Faith, starring as a priest named Brian Finn. The film received mixed critical reviews, with The Dallas Morning News praising his acting and labeling the film \"a smart directorial debut.\" Entertainment Weekly remarked that Norton's emergence as a director was decent, but criticized the plot because it \"proposes heavy theological aims, then disavows any such thing.\" In 2001's heist film The Score, Norton plays Jack Teller, an ambitious young thief caught in an unlikely alliance with career criminal Nick Wells (Robert De Niro) arranged by his fence, Max (Marlon Brando). The Score and Norton's performance were well received, with The San Francisco Chronicle stating that despite starring with screen legends De Niro and Brando, Norton's acting \"outdoes even that of Brando.\"\n\n**2007-2011: The Incredible Hulk and Controversies**\n\nNorton appeared in two documentaries in 2007: Brando, which chronicles the life and career of screen legend Marlon Brando, with whom Norton co-starred in 2001's The Score, and Man from Plains, which depicts the post-presidency endeavors of former U.S president Jimmy Carter. His next lead film role was Marvel Cinematic Universe's Bruce Banner, and the accompanying alter ego Hulk in the big-budget superhero film The Incredible Hulk, released in 2008. Norton initially turned down the part as he felt the 2003 version Hulk \"strayed far afield from a story that was familiar to people, .. which is a fugitive story.\" He provided rewrites of the script every day of filming. Director Louis Leterrier welcomed his contributions, saying that, \"Edward's script has given Bruce's story real gravitas.\" However, screenwriter Zak Penn was displeased with Norton's changes. The Writers Guild of America credited Penn as the sole writer, arguing that Norton had not contributed significantly to the screenplay. Norton did not participate in promoting the film and went to Africa for humanitarian activities instead, leading to rumors that Norton was sparking conflicts with the film's producers. He dismissed the accusations and said that the media had misrepresented the \"healthy\" collaborations for headlines.\n\n**2012-Present: Limited Work**\n\nNorton had two lead film roles in 2012. He starred as scoutmaster Randy Ward in charge of finding his missing camper in the coming-of-age film Moonrise Kingdom, directed by Wes Anderson. The film was acclaimed by critics and grossed over $68 million. His other lead role was in the action thriller The Bourne Legacy, the fourth installment in the Bourne series. In the film, Norton portrayed retired Air Force colonel Eric Byer, who decides to terminate an illegal operation after it is exposed to the FBI and kill everyone involved. The Bourne Legacy received lukewarm reviews but has been Norton's highest-grossing venture so far, earning over $276 million worldwide.

fighter jet [17]\n\n\nFilming\nFilming began in Oceanside, California, on June 26, 1985, with it later moving to Miramar to begin shooting scenes on the aircraft [26] The Navy made aircraft and crew from Carrier Air Wing Fifteen (CVW-15) available for the movie, which then consisted of F-14 squadrons VF-51 \"Screaming Eagles\" (which Mike \"Viper\" Metcalf mentions in the scene at his home) and VF-111 \"Sundowners\" (which was referenced by Marcus \"Sundown\" Williams' callsign and helmet design) [27] Paramount paid as much as US$7,800 per hour (equivalent to $22,100 in 2023) for fuel and other operating costs whenever aircraft were flown outside their normal duties After filming wrapped up, one of the aircraft used (BuNo 160694) was sent to the USS Lexington Museum in Corpus Christi, Texas, where it resides today [28] Aside from the aircraft of CVW-15, F-14s of other squadrons made background appearances Aircraft of VF-114 \"Aardvarks\" and VF-213 \"Blacklions\" appear in shots of the carrier sequences filmed aboard the Enterprise, [29] while the fleet of VF-1 \"Wolfpack\" is visible in shots taken at Miramar The majority of the carrier flight deck shots were of normal aircraft operations and the film crew had to take what they could get, save for the occasional flyby which the film crew would request During filming, director Tony Scott wanted to film aircraft landing and taking off, back-lit by the sun During one particular filming sequence, the ship's commanding officer changed the ship's course, thus changing the light When Scott asked if they could continue on their previous course and speed, he was informed by the commander that it cost US$25,000 (equivalent to $71,000 in 2023) to turn the ship, and to continue on course Scott wrote the carrier's captain a check so that the ship could be turned and he could continue shooting for another five minutes [30]\n\n\nLocations\nThe San Diego restaurant and bar Kansas City Barbeque served as a filming location for two scenes shot in July 1985 The first scene features Goose and Maverick singing \"Great Balls of Fire\" while seated at the piano The final scene, where \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" can be heard on the restaurant's Wurlitzer jukebox, was also filmed at the restaurant Both scenes were filmed consecutively After the release of the movie, the restaurant went on to collect a significant amount of memorabilia from the motion picture until a kitchen fire on June 26, 2008, destroyed much of the restaurant Some memorabilia and props, including the original piano used in the film, survived the fire, and the restaurant re-opened in November 2008 [44]\n\n\nMusic\nThe Top Gun soundtrack is one of the most popular soundtracks to date, reaching 9× Platinum certification [48] and No 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart for five non-consecutive weeks in the summer and fall of 1986 [49] Harold Faltermeyer, who previously worked with both Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson on Beverly Hills Cop, was sent the script of Top Gun by Bruckheimer before filming began Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock worked on numerous songs including the Oscar-winning \"Take My Breath Away\" Kenny Loggins performed two songs on the soundtrack, \"Playing with the Boys\", and \"Danger Zone\" Berlin recorded the song \"Take My Breath Away\", which would later win numerous awards, sending the band to international acclaim After the release of Loggins's single \"Danger Zone\", sales of the album exploded, selling 7 million in the United States alone On the re-release of the soundtrack in 2000, two songs that had been omitted from the original album (and had been released many years before the film was made), \"Great Balls of Fire\" by Jerry Lee Lewis and \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" by The Righteous Brothers, were added The soundtrack also includes \"Top Gun Anthem\" and \"Memories\" by Faltermeyer, with Steve Stevens also performing on the former.\n\n\nRelease\nThe film's

The film stars Tom Cruise as Lieutenant Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, a hotshot fighter pilot who attends the United States Navy's elite Top Gun program. The film follows Maverick's experiences at the program, where he clashes with his instructor, Mike \"Viper\" Metcalf, and falls in love with his Radar Intercept Officer, Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood. Top Gun was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $353 million worldwide and becoming one of the highest-grossing films of 1986.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film follows Lieutenant Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, a hotshot fighter pilot who is sent to the United States Navy's elite Top Gun program at Naval Air Station Miramar in San Diego, California. Maverick is a skilled pilot, but his cocky attitude and disregard for authority often put him at odds with his instructors and fellow pilots. At the program, Maverick meets his Radar Intercept Officer, Radarman 2nd Class Nicholas \"Goose\" Bradshaw, who becomes his wingman and friend. Maverick and Goose participate in a series of training exercises, where they clash with their instructors, including Mike \"Viper\" Metcalf, who is determined to teach Maverick the value of teamwork and following orders.\n\nAs the training exercises progress, Maverick and Goose become embroiled in a rivalry with a group of pilots from the Navy's rival fighter squadron, who are led by Lieutenant Commander Ron \"Slats\" Kerner. Maverick and Goose also begin to develop feelings for each other's girlfriends, Maverick's Radar Intercept Officer, Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood, and Goose's girlfriend, Carole Bradshaw. As the program comes to a close, Maverick and Goose must confront their personal and professional demons in order to emerge as top pilots.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a talented cast of characters, including:\n\n* Tom Cruise as Lieutenant Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell\n* Kelly McGillis as Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood\n* Val Kilmer as Lieutenant Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky\n* Anthony Edwards as Lieutenant Junior Grade Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw\n* Tom Skerritt as Commander Mike \"Viper\" Metcalf\n* John Stockwell as Lieutenant Junior Grade Bill \"Cougar\" Cortellini\n\n**Production**\n\nThe film was produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, who had previously collaborated on the hit film Beverly Hills Cop. The film was shot on location in San Diego, California, and at Naval Air Station Miramar, where the real-life Top Gun program is based. The film's aerial sequences were shot using a combination of real aircraft and special effects.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe film was inspired by a 1983 article in California magazine, which featured aerial photography by then-Lieutenant Commander Charles \"Heater\" Heatley. The article detailed the life of fighter pilots at Naval Air Station Miramar in San Diego, self-nicknamed \"Fightertown USA\". The article was a huge success, and it caught the attention of Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, who saw an opportunity to make a film about the elite Top Gun program.\n\n**Filming**\n\nFilming began in Oceanside, California, on June 26, 1985, with it later moving to Miramar to begin shooting scenes on the aircraft. The Navy made aircraft and crew from Carrier Air Wing Fifteen (CVW-15) available for the movie, which then consisted of F-14 squadrons VF-51 \"Screaming Eagles\" (which Mike \"Viper\" Metcalf mentions in the scene at his home) and VF-111 \"Sundowners\" (which was referenced by Marcus \"Sundown\" Williams' callsign and helmet design). Paramount paid as much as US$7,800 per hour (equivalent to $22,100 in 2023) for fuel and other operating costs whenever aircraft were flown outside their normal duties.\n\n**Locations**\n\nThe San Diego restaurant and bar Kansas City Barbeque served as a filming location for two scenes shot in July 1985. The first scene features Goose and Maverick singing \"Great Balls of Fire\" while seated at the piano. The final scene, where \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" can be heard on the restaurant's Wurlitzer jukebox, was also filmed at the restaurant.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe Top Gun soundtrack is one of the most popular soundtracks to date, reaching 9× Platinum certification and No 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart for five non-consecutive weeks in the summer and fall of 1986. Harold Faltermeyer, who previously worked with both Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson on Beverly Hills Cop, was sent the script of Top Gun by Bruckheimer before filming began. Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock worked on numerous songs including the Oscar-winning \"Take My Breath Away\". Kenny Loggins performed two songs on the soundtrack, \"Playing with the Boys\" and \"Danger Zone\".\n\n**Release**\n\nThe film's premiere was held in New York City on May 12, 1986, with another held in San Diego on May 15. The film was released in the United States on May 16, 1986, and it quickly became a critical and commercial success.\n\n**Theatrical**\n\nThe film was a huge success, grossing over $353 million worldwide and becoming one of the highest-grossing films of 1986. The film was released in the United States on May 16, 1986, and it quickly became a critical and commercial success.\n\n**Home Media**\n\nIn addition to its box office success, Top Gun went on to break further records in the then still-developing home video market. It was the first new-release blockbuster on VHS to be priced as low as $26.95 and, backed by a massive $8 million marketing campaign, including a Top Gun-themed Diet Pepsi commercial, the advance demand was such that the film became the best-selling VHS in the industry's history on pre-orders alone, with over 1.9 million units ordered before its launch on March 11, 1987.\n\n**IMAX 3D Re-release**\n\nTop Gun was re-released in IMAX 3D on February 8, 2013, for six days. A four-minute preview of the conversion, featuring the \"Danger Zone\" flight sequence, was screened at the 2012 International Broadcasting Convention in Amsterdam, Netherlands.\n\n**2021 Re-release**\n\nTop Gun was re-released in Dolby Cinema and screened by AMC Theatres on 153 screens on May 13, 2021. On the first weekend it grossed a total of $248,000 ranking at number 10. It grossed a total of $433,000 in a ten-day period.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe film quickly became a success and was the highest-grossing film of 1986.

Soxx & the Blue Jeans, the Ronettes, and the Righteous Brothers\nIn 1962, Spector briefly took a job as an A&R producer for Liberty Records [28] It was while working at Liberty that he heard a song written by Gene Pitney, for whom he had produced a number 41 hit, \"Every Breath I Take\", a year earlier \"He's a Rebel\" was due to be released on Liberty by Vikki Carr, but Spector rushed into Gold Star Studios and recorded a cover version using Darlene Love and the Blossoms on lead vocals The record was released on Philles, attributed to the Crystals, and quickly rose to the top of the charts.\n\n\n1966–1969: Ike & Tina Turner and hiatus\nSpector's final signing to Philles was the husband-and-wife team of Ike & Tina Turner in April 1966 [33] [34] Spector considered their single \"River Deep – Mountain High\" his best work, [35] but it failed to reach any higher than number 88 in the United States The record, which actually featured Tina Turner without Ike Turner, was successful in Britain, reaching number 3.\n\n\n1970–1973: Comeback and Beatles collaborations\nIn early 1970, Allen Klein, the new manager of the Beatles, brought Spector to England [39]: 137  After impressing with his production of John Lennon's solo single \"Instant Karma!\", which went to number 3, [24]: 2252  Spector was invited by Lennon and George Harrison to take on the task of turning the Beatles' abandoned Let It Be recording sessions into a usable album [40]: 136–137  He went to work using many of his production techniques, making significant changes to the arrangements and sound of some songs [41] Released a month after the Beatles' break-up, the album topped the U.S and UK charts It also yielded the number 1 U.S single \"The Long and Winding Road\" [4]: 254–255  Spector's overdubbing of \"The Long and Winding Road\" infuriated its composer, Paul McCartney [41] In addition to McCartney, several music critics also criticized Spector's work on Let It Be Spector claimed this was partly due to resentment that an American producer appeared to be \"taking over\" such a popular English band [4]: 254–255  Lennon defended Spector, telling Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone: \"he was given the shittiest load of badly recorded shit, with a lousy feeling toward it, ever And he made something out of it He did a great job.\" [42]\n\n\n1974–1980: Near-fatal accident, Warner-Spector Records, Leonard Cohen, and the Ramones\nAs the 1970s progressed, Spector became increasingly reclusive The most probable and significant reason for his withdrawal, according to biographer Dave Thompson, was that in 1974 he was seriously injured when he was thrown through the windshield of his car in a crash in Hollywood [52] Spector was almost killed, and it was only because the attending police officer detected a faint pulse that Spector was not declared dead at the scene He was admitted to the UCLA Medical Center on the night of March 31, suffering serious head injuries that required several hours of surgery, with over 300 stitches to his face and more than 400 to the back of his head [53] His head injuries, Thompson suggests, were the reason that Spector began his habit of wearing outlandish wigs in later years [54]\n\n\n1981–2003: Inactivity\nSpector remained inactive throughout most of the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s In early 1981, shortly after the death of John Lennon, he temporarily re-emerged to co-produce Yoko Ono's Season of Glass [61]\n\n\n2003–2021: Clarkson murder and imprisonment\nOn February 3, 2003, Spector shot actress Lana Clarkson in the mouth while in his mansion (the Pyrenees Castle) in Alhambra, California Her body was found slumped in a chair with a single gunshot wound to her mouth [68] Spector told Esquire in July 2003 that Clarkson's death was an \"accidental suicide\" and that she \"kissed the gun\" [69] The emergency call from Spector's home, made by Spector's driver, Adriano de Souza, quotes Spector as saying, \"I think I killed somebody.\" [69] De Souza added that he saw Spector come out of the back door of the house with a gun in his hand [69]\n\n\nMusicianship\nSpector's early musical influences included Latin music in general, and Latin percussion in particular [91] This is perceptible in many if not all of Spector's recordings, from the percussion in many of his hit songs: shakers, güiros (gourds), and maracas in \"Be My Baby\" and the son montuno in \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling\" (heard clearly in the song's bridge, played by session bassist Carol Kaye, while the same repeating refrain is played on harpsichord by Larry Knechtel).\n\n\nLegacy and influence\nAccording to guitarist Stevie Van Zandt of the E Street Band, Spector was a \"genius irredeemably conflicted\" On Twitter, he wrote: \" [Spector] was the ultimate example of the art always being better than the artist..  [He] made some of the greatest records in history based on the salvation of love while remaining incapable of giving or receiving love his whole life.\" [96]\n\n\nPersonal life\nSpector's first marriage was in 1963 to Annette Merar, lead vocalist of the Spectors Three, a 1960s pop trio formed and produced by Spector He named a record company after Merar, Annette Records [112] Spector and Merar divorced in 1966 [6] While still married to Merar, he began having an affair with Ronnie Bennett, later known as Ronnie Spector [113] Bennett was the lead singer of the girl group the Ronettes (another group Spector managed and produced) They married in 1968 and adopted a son, Donté Phillip Spector [114] As a Christmas present, Spector surprised her by adopting twins Louis Phillip Spector and Gary Phillip Spector [114] [115]\n\n\nRelationships and children\nSpector's first marriage was in 1963 to Annette Merar, lead vocalist of the Spectors Three, a 1960s pop trio formed and produced by Spector He named a record company after Merar, Annette Records [112] Spector and Merar divorced in 1966 [6] While still married to Merar, he began having an affair with Ronnie Bennett, later known as Ronnie Spector [113] Bennett was the lead singer of the girl group the Ronettes (another group Spector managed and produced) They married in 1968 and adopted a son, Donté Phillip Spector [114] As a Christmas present, Spector surprised her by adopting twins Louis Phillip Spector and Gary Phillip Spector [114] [115]\n\n\nHealth, illness, and death\nSpector testified in a 2005 court deposition that he had been treated for bipolar disorder for eight years, saying, \"No sleep, depression, mood changes, mood swings, hard to live with, hard to concentrate, just hard—a hard time getting through life, I've been called a genius and I think a genius is not there all the time and has borderline insanity.\" [123]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nSpector is one of a handful of producers to have number one records in three consecutive decades (1950s, 1960s and 1970s) Others in this group include Quincy Jones (1960s, 1970s, and 1980s), George Martin (1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s), Michael Omartian (1970s, 1980s and 1990s), Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis (1980s, 1990s, and 2000s), and Max Martin (1990s, 2000, 2010s, and 2020s) [143] [144]\n\n\nDiscography\nSpector is one of a handful of producers to have number one records in three consecutive decades (1950s, 1960s and 1970s) Others in this group include Quincy Jones (1960s, 1970s, and 1980s), George Martin (1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s), Michael Omartian (1970s, 1980s and 1990s), Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis (1980s, 1990s, and 2000s), and Max Martin (1990s, 2000, 2010s, and 2020s) [143] [144]\n\n\nAwards\nSpector is one of a handful of producers to have number one records in three consecutive decades (1950s, 1960s and 1970s) Others in this group include Quincy Jones (1960s, 1970s, and 1980s), George Martin (1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s), Michael Omartian (1970s, 1980s and 1990s), Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis (1980s, 1990s, and 2000s), and Max Martin (1990s, 2000, 2010s, and 2020s) [143] [144]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Phil Spector**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nPhil Spector was a renowned American music producer, songwriter, and musician who played a significant role in shaping the sound of popular music in the 1960s. With a career spanning over five decades, Spector produced numerous hit songs and albums for various artists, earning him the nickname \"The Wall of Sound.\" This article provides an overview of Spector's life, career, and legacy.\n\n**Early Life and Background**\n\nHarvey Philip Spector was born on December 26, 1939, in the Bronx, New York City, to a first-generation immigrant Russian-Jewish family. His parents, Benjamin and Bertha, were both born in Eastern Europe and immigrated to the United States. Spector had a sister named Shirley, who was six years his senior and died in 2004 at the age of 70.\n\nSpector's early life was marked by a love for music, particularly Latin music and percussion. He was exposed to music from a young age and began playing the guitar and drums. His parents encouraged his musical pursuits, and Spector's talent soon became apparent.\n\n**Career**\n\nSpector's music career began in the 1950s as a member of the Teddy Bears, a doo-wop group he formed with his friends. The group's first single, \"To Know Him Is to Love Him,\" became a hit in 1958. Spector's success with the Teddy Bears led to his involvement in the music industry as a producer, songwriter, and musician.\n\n**Philles Records and the Crystals**\n\nIn 1960, Spector formed Philles Records, a record label that would become a hub for his musical endeavors. He produced the Crystals' debut single, \"There's No Other (Like My Baby),\" which became a moderate hit. However, it was the Crystals' follow-up single, \"He's a Rebel,\" that brought Spector his first major success as a producer.\n\n**Bob B. Soxx & the Blue Jeans and the Ronettes**\n\nSpector's next major success came with Bob B. Soxx & the Blue Jeans, a group he produced and managed. The group's single, \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah,\" became a hit in 1962. Spector also produced the Ronettes, a girl group that would become one of his most successful acts. The Ronettes' hit single, \"Be My Baby,\" became a classic of 1960s pop music.\n\n**Ike & Tina Turner and the Righteous Brothers**\n\nSpector's final signing to Philles was the husband-and-wife team of Ike & Tina Turner in 1966. Spector considered their single \"River Deep – Mountain High\" his best work, but it failed to reach any higher than number 88 in the United States. The record was successful in Britain, reaching number 3. Spector also produced the Righteous Brothers, a duo that had a hit with the song \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'.\"\n\n**Comeback and Beatles Collaborations**\n\nIn 1970, Allen Klein, the new manager of the Beatles, brought Spector to England. Spector impressed with his production of John Lennon's solo single \"Instant Karma!,\" which went to number 3. He was invited by Lennon and George Harrison to take on the task of turning the Beatles' abandoned Let It Be recording sessions into a usable album. Spector's work on Let It Be was met with criticism, with some critics accusing him of over-producing the record.\n\n**Near-Fatal Accident and Reclusiveness**\n\nSpector became increasingly reclusive in the 1970s, following a near-fatal car accident in 1974. He was thrown through the windshield of his car and suffered serious head injuries that required surgery. Spector's reclusiveness continued throughout the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s.\n\n**Inactivity and Clarkson Murder**\n\nSpector remained inactive throughout most of the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s. However, he temporarily re-emerged in 1981 to co-produce Yoko Ono's Season of Glass. On February 3, 2003, Spector shot actress Lana Clarkson in the mouth while in his mansion. Clarkson's body was found slumped in a chair with a single gunshot wound to her mouth. Spector claimed that Clarkson's death was an \"accidental suicide.\"\n\n**Musicianship**\n\nSpector's early musical influences included Latin music and percussion. This is perceptible in many of his recordings, including the percussion in \"Be My Baby\" and the son montuno in \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'.\"\n\n**Legacy and Influence**\n\nPhil Spector's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He was a genius producer, songwriter, and musician who played a significant role in shaping the sound of popular music in the 1960s. However, his personal life was marked by controversy and tragedy. Despite his flaws, Spector's music continues to inspire and influence new generations of musicians and music fans.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nSpector's first marriage was in 1963 to Annette Merar, lead vocalist of the Spectors Three. The couple divorced in 1966. While still married to Merar, Spector began having an affair with Ronnie Bennett, later known as Ronnie Spector. The two married in 1968 and adopted two sons, Donté and twins Louis and Gary.\n\n**Health, Illness, and Death**\n\nSpector testified in a 2005 court deposition that he had been treated for bipolar disorder for eight years.

Soxx & the Blue Jeans, the Ronettes, and the Righteous Brothers\nIn 1962, Spector briefly took a job as an A&R producer for Liberty Records [28] It was while working at Liberty that he heard a song written by Gene Pitney, for whom he had produced a number 41 hit, \"Every Breath I Take\", a year earlier \"He's a Rebel\" was due to be released on Liberty by Vikki Carr, but Spector rushed into Gold Star Studios and recorded a cover version using Darlene Love and the Blossoms on lead vocals The record was released on Philles, attributed to the Crystals, and quickly rose to the top of the charts.\n\n\n1966–1969: Ike & Tina Turner and hiatus\nSpector's final signing to Philles was the husband-and-wife team of Ike & Tina Turner in April 1966 [33] [34] Spector considered their single \"River Deep – Mountain High\" his best work, [35] but it failed to reach any higher than number 88 in the United States The record, which actually featured Tina Turner without Ike Turner, was successful in Britain, reaching number 3.\n\n\n1970–1973: Comeback and Beatles collaborations\nIn early 1970, Allen Klein, the new manager of the Beatles, brought Spector to England [39]: 137  After impressing with his production of John Lennon's solo single \"Instant Karma!\", which went to number 3, [24]: 2252  Spector was invited by Lennon and George Harrison to take on the task of turning the Beatles' abandoned Let It Be recording sessions into a usable album [40]: 136–137  He went to work using many of his production techniques, making significant changes to the arrangements and sound of some songs [41] Released a month after the Beatles' break-up, the album topped the U.S and UK charts It also yielded the number 1 U.S single \"The Long and Winding Road\" [4]: 254–255  Spector's overdubbing of \"The Long and Winding Road\" infuriated its composer, Paul McCartney [41] In addition to McCartney, several music critics also criticized Spector's work on Let It Be Spector claimed this was partly due to resentment that an American producer appeared to be \"taking over\" such a popular English band [4]: 254–255  Lennon defended Spector, telling Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone: \"he was given the shittiest load of badly recorded shit, with a lousy feeling toward it, ever And he made something out of it He did a great job.\" [42]\n\n\n1974–1980: Near-fatal accident, Warner-Spector Records, Leonard Cohen, and the Ramones\nAs the 1970s progressed, Spector became increasingly reclusive The most probable and significant reason for his withdrawal, according to biographer Dave Thompson, was that in 1974 he was seriously injured when he was thrown through the windshield of his car in a crash in Hollywood [52] Spector was almost killed, and it was only because the attending police officer detected a faint pulse that Spector was not declared dead at the scene He was admitted to the UCLA Medical Center on the night of March 31, suffering serious head injuries that required several hours of surgery, with over 300 stitches to his face and more than 400 to the back of his head [53] His head injuries, Thompson suggests, were the reason that Spector began his habit of wearing outlandish wigs in later years [54]\n\n\n1981–2003: Inactivity\nSpector remained inactive throughout most of the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s In early 1981, shortly after the death of John Lennon, he temporarily re-emerged to co-produce Yoko Ono's Season of Glass [61]\n\n\n2003–2021: Clarkson murder and imprisonment\nOn February 3, 2003, Spector shot actress Lana Clarkson in the mouth while in his mansion (the Pyrenees Castle) in Alhambra, California Her body was found slumped in a chair with a single gunshot wound to her mouth [68] Spector told Esquire in July 2003 that Clarkson's death was an \"accidental suicide\" and that she \"kissed the gun\" [69] The emergency call from Spector's home, made by Spector's driver, Adriano de Souza, quotes Spector as saying, \"I think I killed somebody.\" [69] De Souza added that he saw Spector come out of the back door of the house with a gun in his hand [69]\n\n\nMusicianship\nSpector's early musical influences included Latin music in general, and Latin percussion in particular [91] This is perceptible in many if not all of Spector's recordings, from the percussion in many of his hit songs: shakers, güiros (gourds), and maracas in \"Be My Baby\" and the son montuno in \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling\" (heard clearly in the song's bridge, played by session bassist Carol Kaye, while the same repeating refrain is played on harpsichord by Larry Knechtel).\n\n\nLegacy and influence\nAccording to guitarist Stevie Van Zandt of the E Street Band, Spector was a \"genius irredeemably conflicted\" On Twitter, he wrote: \" [Spector] was the ultimate example of the art always being better than the artist..  [He] made some of the greatest records in history based on the salvation of love while remaining incapable of giving or receiving love his whole life.\" [96]\n\n\nPersonal life\nSpector's first marriage was in 1963 to Annette Merar, lead vocalist of the Spectors Three, a 1960s pop trio formed and produced by Spector He named a record company after Merar, Annette Records [112] Spector and Merar divorced in 1966 [6] While still married to Merar, he began having an affair with Ronnie Bennett, later known as Ronnie Spector [113] Bennett was the lead singer of the girl group the Ronettes (another group Spector managed and produced) They married in 1968 and adopted a son, Donté Phillip Spector [114] As a Christmas present, Spector surprised her by adopting twins Louis Phillip Spector and Gary Phillip Spector [114] [115]\n\n\nRelationships and children\nSpector's first marriage was in 1963 to Annette Merar, lead vocalist of the Spectors Three, a 1960s pop trio formed and produced by Spector He named a record company after Merar, Annette Records [112] Spector and Merar divorced in 1966 [6] While still married to Merar, he began having an affair with Ronnie Bennett, later known as Ronnie Spector [113] Bennett was the lead singer of the girl group the Ronettes (another group Spector managed and produced) They married in 1968 and adopted a son, Donté Phillip Spector [114] As a Christmas present, Spector surprised her by adopting twins Louis Phillip Spector and Gary Phillip Spector [114] [115]\n\n\nHealth, illness, and death\nSpector testified in a 2005 court deposition that he had been treated for bipolar disorder for eight years, saying, \"No sleep, depression, mood changes, mood swings, hard to live with, hard to concentrate, just hard—a hard time getting through life, I've been called a genius and I think a genius is not there all the time and has borderline insanity.\" [123]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nSpector is one of a handful of producers to have number one records in three consecutive decades (1950s, 1960s and 1970s) Others in this group include Quincy Jones (1960s, 1970s, and 1980s), George Martin (1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s), Michael Omartian (1970s, 1980s and 1990s), Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis (1980s, 1990s, and 2000s), and Max Martin (1990s, 2000, 2010s, and 2020s) [143] [144]\n\n\nDiscography\nSpector is one of a handful of producers to have number one records in three consecutive decades (1950s, 1960s and 1970s) Others in this group include Quincy Jones (1960s, 1970s, and 1980s), George Martin (1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s), Michael Omartian (1970s, 1980s and 1990s), Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis (1980s, 1990s, and 2000s), and Max Martin (1990s, 2000, 2010s, and 2020s) [143] [144]\n\n\nAwards\nSpector is one of a handful of producers to have number one records in three consecutive decades (1950s, 1960s and 1970s) Others in this group include Quincy Jones (1960s, 1970s, and 1980s), George Martin (1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s), Michael Omartian (1970s, 1980s and 1990s), Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis (1980s, 1990s, and 2000s), and Max Martin (1990s, 2000, 2010s, and 2020s) [143] [144]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

translucency, shadows, a new color palette, and a rounded geometry are prevalent throughout the UI A prevalent aspect of the design is an appearance known as \"Mica\", described as an \"opaque, dynamic material that incorporates theme and desktop wallpaper to paint the background of long-lived windows such as apps and settings\" [104] [105] Much of the interface and start menu takes heavy inspiration from the now-canceled Windows 10X [106] The Segoe UI font used since Windows Vista has been updated to a variable version, improving its ability to scale between different display resolutions [107]\n\n\nWindows Subsystem for Android\nOn October 21, 2021, Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA) became available to Beta channel builds of Windows 11 for users in the United States, [112] which allows users to install and run Android apps on their devices Users can install Android apps through any source using the APK file format [113] An Amazon Appstore client for Microsoft Store is also available [114] [115] [116] [117] The Windows Subsystem for Android and Amazon Appstore became available to Release channel users in the United States on February 15, 2022, in Windows 11 Release build 22000.527 [118] On March 5, 2024, Microsoft announced deprecation of WSA with support ending on March 5, 2025 [119]\n\n\nSetup\nHome and Pro (since version 22H2) edition installation requires internet connection and Microsoft account login (only if for personal use on Pro) is mandatory unless manually bypassed to create a local user [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] However, Microsoft has since blocked one of the last remaining easy bypass methods that allowed local account creation during initial setup, complicating the bypass process further [125] [126] All other editions are excluded from this requirement [108] [127]\n\n\nSystem security\nAs part of the minimum system requirements, Windows 11 only runs on devices with a Trusted Platform Module 2.0 security coprocessor, [128] [129] albeit with some exceptions, see § System requirements for details According to Microsoft, the TPM 2.0 coprocessor is a \"critical building block\" for protection against firmware and hardware attacks In addition, Microsoft now requires devices with Windows 11 to include virtualization-based security (VBS), hypervisor-protected code integrity (HVCI), and Secure Boot built-in and enabled by default [130] The operating system also features hardware-enforced stack protection for supported Intel and AMD processors for protection against zero-day exploits [131]\n\n\nArtificial intelligence\nIn subsequent updates, Microsoft added several features based on artificial intelligence (AI), like live captions, background noise removal in videoconferencing, webcam auto-framing that follows the user's movements, [93] and AI-powered Bing Chat in the taskbar's search field [132] Following the integration of GPT-4 in Microsoft's other products, the company announced that by summer 2023, the newly released Microsoft Copilot would add GPT-4 integration to the Windows taskbar [133]\n\n\nEditions\nWindows 11 is available in two main editions; the Home edition, which is intended for consumer users, and the Pro edition, which contains additional networking and security features (such as BitLocker), as well as the ability to join a domain [138] Windows 11 Home may be restricted by default to verified software obtained from Microsoft Store (\"S Mode\") [139] Windows 11 Home requires an Internet connection and a Microsoft account in order to complete first-time setup [140] This restriction is also applied to Windows 11 Pro since version 22H2 [124] as it was announced in February 2022, although a Microsoft account isn't required if it's not for personal use [141]\n\n\nOther editions\nOther editions include Pro Education, Pro for Workstations, Education, Enterprise, Enterprise multi-session, IoT Enterprise, Enterprise LTSC, IoT Enterprise LTSC, Home Single Language, and Team; along with regional variations These editions remain fundamentally the same as their Windows 10 edition counterparts.\n\n\nSupported languages\nBefore the launch of Windows 11, OEMs (as well as mobile operators) and businesses were offered two options for device imaging: Component-Based Servicing lp.cab files (for the languages to be preloaded on the first boot) and Local Experience Pack .appx files (for the languages available for download on supported PCs) The 38 fully-localized Language Pack (LP) languages were available as both lp.cab and .appx packages, while the remaining 72 partially-localized Language Interface Pack (LIP) languages were only available as .appx packages [145]\n\n\nUpdates and support\nLike Windows 10, Windows 11 follows Microsoft's Modern Lifecycle Policy Each annual feature update has its own support lifecycle: two years for the Home and Pro editions, and three years for the Education and Enterprise editions Microsoft has stated that Windows 11 provides no lifecycle guarantee if it has been installed on a machine that does not meet its minimum hardware requirements [146]\n\n\nPreview releases\nThe Windows Insider program carries over from Windows 10, with pre-release builds divided into \"Dev\" (unstable builds used to test features for future feature updates), \"Beta\" (test builds for the next feature update; relatively stable in comparison to Dev channel), and \"Release Preview\" (pre-release builds for final testing of upcoming feature updates) channels [148]\n\n\nVersions\nThe basic system requirements of Windows 11 differ significantly from Windows 10 Windows 11 only supports 64-bit systems such as those using an x86-64 or ARM64 processor; IA-32 and ARM32 processors are no longer supported [129] Thus, Windows 11 is the first consumer version of Windows not to support 32-bit processors (although Windows Server 2008 R2 is the first version of Windows Server to not support them) [152] [153] The minimum RAM and storage requirements were also increased; Windows 11 now requires at least 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage [154] S mode is only supported for the Home edition of Windows 11 [155]\n\n\nSystem requirements\nThe basic system requirements of Windows 11 differ significantly from Windows 10 Windows 11 only supports 64-bit systems such as those using an x86-64 or ARM64 processor;

however, a clean install or upgrade using ISO installation media must be performed as Windows Update will not offer an upgrade from Windows 10 [163] Additionally, users must also accept an on-screen disclaimer stating that they will not be entitled to receive updates, and that damage caused by using Windows 11 on an unsupported configuration are not covered by the manufacturer's warranty [164] [165]\n\n\nFirmware compatibility\nLegacy BIOS is no longer officially supported; a UEFI system and a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 security coprocessor is now officially required [108] [149] [169] [170] The TPM requirement in particular has led to confusion as many motherboards do not have TPM support, or require a compatible TPM to be physically installed onto the motherboard Many newer CPUs also include a TPM implemented at the CPU level (with AMD referring to this as \"fTPM\", and Intel referring to it as \"Platform Trust Technology\"  [PTT]), [171] which might be disabled by default and require changing settings in the computer's UEFI firmware, [172] or a UEFI firmware update that changes the default settings to reflect these requirements [173]\n\n\nThird-party software\nSome third-party software may refuse to run on configurations of Windows 11 that do not comply with the hardware security requirement After the release of Windows 11, Riot Games' kernel-level anti-cheat system Vanguard—used in Valorant and since May 2024 by League of Legends [174]—began to enforce the operating system security requirements, and will not allow the games to be run on the OS if secure boot and a TPM 2.0-compliant coprocessor are not enabled [175]\n\n\nIoT Enterprise editions\nWhile IoT Enterprise editions have always had slightly reduced official requirements compared to other Windows 11 editions, notably starting with version 24H2, minimum requirements were further reduced and now differ significantly These updated 24H2 requirements were announced on May 22, 2024, for both LTSC and non-LTSC editions \n\n\nReception\nReception of Windows 11 upon its reveal was positive, with critics praising the new design and productivity features [176] However, Microsoft was criticized for creating confusion over the minimum system requirements for Windows 11 [177] The increased system requirements (compared to those of Windows 10) initially published by Microsoft meant that up to 60 percent of existing Windows 10 PCs were unable to upgrade to Windows 11, [178] which has faced concerns that this will contribute to electronic waste [179]\n\n\nPre-release\nReception of Windows 11 upon its reveal was positive, with critics praising the new design and productivity features [176] However, Microsoft was criticized for creating confusion over the minimum system requirements for Windows 11 [177] The increased system requirements (compared to those of Windows 10) initially published by Microsoft meant that up to 60 percent of existing Windows 10 PCs were unable to upgrade to Windows 11, [178] which has faced concerns that this will contribute to electronic waste [179]\n\n\nLaunch\nAndrew Cunningham of Ars Technica gave a mixed but overall cautiously positive review of Windows 11 upon its release He praised the improvements to its visual design (describing the new \"Mica\" appearance as reminiscent of the visual appearance of iOS and macOS, and arguing that Microsoft had \" [made] a serious effort\" at making the user-facing aspects of Windows 11 more consistent visually He also praised window management, performance (assessed as being equivalent to if not better than Windows 10), other \"beneficial tweaks\" Criticism was raised towards Widgets' lack of support for third-party content, thus limiting it to Microsoft services only, regressions in taskbar functionality and customization He also noted the inability to easily select default applications for common tasks such as web browsing, as it requires the user to select the browser application for each file type individually Apart from the user interface, system requirements and Microsoft's unclear justification for its processor compatibility criteria remained a major sticking point for him While some of the system requirements have brought greater public attention to hardware security features present on modern PCs, he argued that these could already be employed on Windows 10, albeit optionally Cunningham concluded that \"as I've dug into  [Windows 11] and learned its ins and outs for this review, I've warmed to it more\", but argued that the OS was facing similar \"public perception\" issues to Windows Vista and Windows 8 However, he noted that 11 did not have as many performance issues or bugs as Vista had upon its release, nor was as \"disjointed\" as 8, and recommended that users who were unsure about the upgrade should stay on Windows 10 in anticipation of future updates to 11 [104]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Windows 11**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nWindows 11 is a personal computer operating system developed by Microsoft.

It argues that Nixon was referring to the fact that he could talk freely at the event because 10 was the last version in current development.\n\n**Announcement**\n\nAt the Microsoft Build 2021 developer conference, CEO and chairman Satya Nadella teased about the existence of the next generation of Windows during his keynote speech. According to Nadella, he had been self-hosting it for several months. He also teased that an official announcement would come very soon. Just a week after Nadella's keynote, Microsoft started sending invitations for a dedicated Windows media event at 11:00 a.m ET on June 24, 2021. Microsoft also posted an 11-minute video of Windows start-up sounds to YouTube on June 10, 2021, with many people speculating both the time of the Microsoft event and the duration of the Windows start-up sound video to be a reference to the name of the operating system as Windows 11.\n\n**Release and Marketing**\n\nThe Windows 11 name was accidentally released in an official Microsoft support document in June 2021. Leaked images of a purported beta build of Windows 11's desktop surfaced online later on June 15, 2021, which were followed by a leak of the aforementioned build on the same day. The screenshots and leaked build show an interface resembling that of the canceled Windows 10X, alongside a redesigned out-of-box experience (OOBE) and Windows 11 branding. Microsoft would later confirm the authenticity of the leaked beta, with Panay stating that it was an \"early weird build.\"\n\n**Features**\n\nWindows 11, the first major Windows release since 2015, builds upon its predecessor by revamping the user interface to follow Microsoft's new Fluent Design guidelines.

Users can install Android apps through any source using the APK file format. An Amazon Appstore client for Microsoft Store is also available. The Windows Subsystem for Android and Amazon Appstore became available to Release channel users in the United States on February 15, 2022, in Windows 11 Release build 22000.527.

However, Microsoft has since blocked one of the last remaining easy bypass methods that allowed local account creation during initial setup, complicating the bypass process further. All other editions are excluded from this requirement.\n\n**System Security**\n\nAs part of the minimum system requirements, Windows 11 only runs on devices with a Trusted Platform Module 2.0 security coprocessor, albeit with some exceptions, see § System requirements for details. According to Microsoft, the TPM 2.0 coprocessor is a \"critical building block\" for protection against firmware and hardware attacks. In addition, Microsoft now requires devices with Windows 11 to include virtualization-based security (VBS), hypervisor-protected code integrity (HVCI), and Secure Boot built-in and enabled by default. The operating system also features hardware-enforced stack protection for supported Intel and AMD processors for protection against zero-day exploits.\n\n**Artificial Intelligence**\n\nIn subsequent updates, Microsoft added several features based on artificial intelligence (AI), like live captions, background noise removal in videoconferencing, webcam auto-framing that follows the user's movements, and AI-powered Bing Chat in the taskbar's search field. Following the integration of GPT-4 in Microsoft's other products, the company announced that by summer 2023, the newly released Microsoft Copilot would add GPT-4 integration to the Windows taskbar.\n\n**Editions**\n\nWindows 11 is available in two main editions; the Home edition, which is intended for consumer users, and the Pro edition, which contains additional networking and security features (such as BitLocker), as well as the ability to join a domain. Windows 11 Home may be restricted by default to verified software obtained from Microsoft Store (\"S Mode\"). Windows 11 Home requires an Internet connection and a Microsoft account in order to complete first-time setup. This restriction is also applied to Windows 11 Pro since version 22H2 as it was announced in February 2022, although a Microsoft account isn't required if it's not for personal use.\n\n**Other Editions**\n\nOther editions include Pro Education, Pro for Workstations, Education, Enterprise, Enterprise multi-session, IoT Enterprise, Enterprise LTSC, IoT Enterprise LTSC, Home Single Language, and Team; along with regional variations. These editions remain fundamentally the same as their Windows 10 edition counterparts.\n\n**Supported Languages**\n\nBefore the launch of Windows 11, OEMs (as well as mobile operators) and businesses were offered two options for device imaging: Component-Based Servicing lp.cab files (for the languages to be preloaded on the first boot) and Local Experience Pack .appx files (for the languages available for download on supported PCs). The 38 fully-localized Language Pack (LP) languages were available as both lp.cab and .appx packages, while the remaining 72 partially-localized Language Interface Pack (LIP) languages were only available as .appx packages.\n\n**Updates and Support**\n\nLike Windows 10, Windows 11 follows Microsoft's Modern Lifecycle Policy. Each annual feature update has its own support lifecycle: two years for the Home and Pro editions, and three years for the Education and Enterprise editions. Microsoft has stated that Windows 11 provides no lifecycle guarantee if it has been installed on a machine that does not meet its minimum hardware requirements.\n\n**Preview Releases**\n\nThe Windows Insider program carries over from Windows 10, with pre-release builds divided into \"Dev\" (unstable builds used to test features for future feature updates), \"Beta\" (test builds for the next feature update; relatively stable in comparison to Dev channel), and \"Release Preview\" (pre-release builds for final testing of upcoming feature updates) channels.\n\n**Versions**\n\nThe basic system requirements of Windows 11 differ significantly from Windows 10. Windows 11 only supports 64-bit systems such as those using an x86-64 or ARM64 processor; IA-32 and ARM32 processors are no longer supported. Thus, Windows 11 is the first consumer version of Windows not to support 32-bit processors (although Windows Server 2008 R2 is the first version of Windows Server to not support them). The minimum RAM and storage requirements were also increased; Windows 11 now requires at least 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage. S mode is only supported for the Home edition of Windows 11.\n\n**System Requirements**\n\nThe basic system requirements of Windows 11 differ significantly from Windows 10.

The minimum RAM and storage requirements were also increased; Windows 11 now requires at least 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage. S mode is only supported for the Home edition of Windows 11.\n\n**Firmware Compatibility**\n\nLegacy BIOS is no longer officially supported; a UEFI system and a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 security coprocessor is now officially required. The TPM requirement in particular has led to confusion as many motherboards do not have TPM support, or require a compatible TPM to be physically installed onto the motherboard. Many newer CPUs also include a TPM implemented at the CPU level (with AMD referring to this as \"fTPM,\" and Intel referring to it as \"Platform Trust Technology\" [PTT]), which might be disabled by default and require changing settings in the computer's UEFI firmware, or a UEFI firmware update that changes the default settings to reflect these requirements.\n\n**Third-Party Software**\n\nSome third-party software may refuse to run on configurations of Windows 11 that do not comply with the hardware security requirement. After the release of Windows 11, Riot Games' kernel-level anti-cheat system Vanguard—used in Valorant and since May 2024 by League of Legends—began to enforce the operating system security requirements, and will not allow the games to be run on the OS if secure boot and a TPM 2.0-compliant coprocessor are not enabled.\n\n**IoT Enterprise Editions**\n\nWhile IoT Enterprise editions have always had slightly reduced official requirements compared to other Windows 11 editions, notably starting with version 24H2, minimum requirements were further reduced and now differ significantly. These updated 24H2 requirements were announced on May 22, 2024, for both LTSC and non-LTSC editions.\n\n**Reception**\n\nReception of Windows 11 upon its reveal was positive, with critics praising the new design and productivity features. However, Microsoft was criticized for creating confusion over the minimum system requirements for Windows 11. The increased system requirements (compared to those of Windows 10) initially published by Microsoft meant that up to 60 percent of existing Windows 10 PCs were unable to upgrade to Windows 11, which has faced concerns that this will contribute to electronic waste.\n\n**Pre-Release**\n\nReception of Windows 11 upon its reveal was positive, with critics praising the new design and productivity features. However, Microsoft was criticized for creating confusion over the minimum system requirements for Windows 11. The increased system requirements (compared to those of Windows 10) initially published by Microsoft meant that up to 60 percent of existing Windows 10 PCs were unable to upgrade to Windows 11, which has faced concerns that this will contribute to electronic waste.\n\n**Launch**\n\nAndrew Cunningham of Ars Technica gave a mixed but overall cautiously positive review of Windows 11 upon its release. He praised the improvements to its visual design (describing the new \"Mica\" appearance as reminiscent of the visual appearance of iOS and macOS, and arguing that Microsoft had \"made a serious effort\" at making the user-facing aspects of Windows 11 more consistent visually). He also praised window management, performance (assessed as being equivalent to if not better than Windows 10), other \"beneficial tweaks.\" Criticism was raised towards Widgets' lack of support for third-party content, thus limiting it to Microsoft services only, regressions in taskbar functionality and customization. He also noted the inability to easily select default applications for common tasks such as web browsing, as it requires the user to select the browser application for each file type individually. Apart from the user interface, system requirements and Microsoft's unclear justification for its processor compatibility criteria remained a major sticking point for him. While some of the system requirements have brought greater public attention to hardware security features present on modern PCs, he argued that these could already be employed on Windows 10, albeit optionally. Cunningham concluded that \"as I've dug into Windows 11 and learned its ins and outs for this review, I've warmed to it more\", but argued that the OS was facing similar \"public perception\" issues to Windows Vista and Windows 8. However, he noted that 11 did not have as many performance issues or bugs as Vista had upon its release, nor was as \"disjointed\" as 8, and recommended that users who were unsure about the upgrade should stay on Windows 10 in anticipation of future updates to 11.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Windows 10\n* Windows Server\n* Microsoft Azure\n* Microsoft Office\n\n**References**\n\n* \n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Windows_11\" following this outline:\n\n\nDevelopment\nAt the 2015 Ignite conference, Microsoft employee Jerry Nixon stated that Windows 10 would be the \"last version of Windows\" [26] [27] The operating system was considered to be a service, with new builds and updates to be released over time [28] PC World argued that the widely reported comment was however taken out of context, noting that the official event transcript marks it only as a segue rather than a core part of the talk It argues that Nixon was referring to the fact that he could talk freely at the event because 10 was the last version in current development [29]\n\n\nAnnouncement\nAt the Microsoft Build 2021 developer conference, CEO and chairman Satya Nadella teased about the existence of the next generation of Windows during his keynote speech According to Nadella, he had been self-hosting it for several months He also teased that an official announcement would come very soon [42] Just a week after Nadella's keynote, Microsoft started sending invitations for a dedicated Windows media event at 11:00 a.m ET on June 24, 2021 [43] [44] Microsoft also posted an 11-minute video of Windows start-up sounds to YouTube on June 10, 2021, with many people speculating both the time of the Microsoft event and the duration of the Windows start-up sound video to be a reference to the name of the operating system as Windows 11 [45] [46]\n\n\nRelease and marketing\nThe Windows 11 name was accidentally released in an official Microsoft support document in June 2021 [53] [54] Leaked images of a purported beta build of Windows 11's desktop surfaced online later on June 15, 2021, [55] [56] which were followed by a leak of the aforementioned build on the same day [57] The screenshots and leaked build show an interface resembling that of the canceled Windows 10X, alongside a redesigned out-of-box experience (OOBE) and Windows 11 branding [58] Microsoft would later confirm the authenticity of the leaked beta, with Panay stating that it was an \"early weird build\" [59] [60]\n\n\nFeatures\nWindows 11, the first major Windows release since 2015, builds upon its predecessor by revamping the user interface to follow Microsoft's new Fluent Design guidelines The redesign, which focuses on ease of use and flexibility, [63] comes alongside new productivity and social features and updates to security and accessibility, addressing some of the deficiencies of Windows 10 [83]\n\n\nUser interface\nA redesigned user interface is present frequently throughout the operating system, building upon the Fluent Design System; translucency, shadows, a new color palette, and a rounded geometry are prevalent throughout the UI A prevalent aspect of the design is an appearance known as \"Mica\", described as an \"opaque, dynamic material that incorporates theme and desktop wallpaper to paint the background of long-lived windows such as apps and settings\" [104] [105] Much of the interface and start menu takes heavy inspiration from the now-canceled Windows 10X [106] The Segoe UI font used since Windows Vista has been updated to a variable version, improving its ability to scale between different display resolutions [107]\n\n\nWindows Subsystem for Android\nOn October 21, 2021, Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA) became available to Beta channel builds of Windows 11 for users in the United States, [112] which allows users to install and run Android apps on their devices Users can install Android apps through any source using the APK file format [113] An Amazon Appstore client for Microsoft Store is also available [114] [115] [116] [117] The Windows Subsystem for Android and Amazon Appstore became available to Release channel users in the United States on February 15, 2022, in Windows 11 Release build 22000.527 [118] On March 5, 2024, Microsoft announced deprecation of WSA with support ending on March 5, 2025 [119]\n\n\nSetup\nHome and Pro (since version 22H2) edition installation requires internet connection and Microsoft account login (only if for personal use on Pro) is mandatory unless manually bypassed to create a local user [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] However, Microsoft has since blocked one of the last remaining easy bypass methods that allowed local account creation during initial setup, complicating the bypass process further [125] [126] All other editions are excluded from this requirement [108] [127]\n\n\nSystem security\nAs part of the minimum system requirements, Windows 11 only runs on devices with a Trusted Platform Module 2.0 security coprocessor, [128] [129] albeit with some exceptions, see § System requirements for details According to Microsoft, the TPM 2.0 coprocessor is a \"critical building block\" for protection against firmware and hardware attacks In addition, Microsoft now requires devices with Windows 11 to include virtualization-based security (VBS), hypervisor-protected code integrity (HVCI), and Secure Boot built-in and enabled by default [130] The operating system also features hardware-enforced stack protection for supported Intel and AMD processors for protection against zero-day exploits [131]\n\n\nArtificial intelligence\nIn subsequent updates, Microsoft added several features based on artificial intelligence (AI), like live captions, background noise removal in videoconferencing, webcam auto-framing that follows the user's movements, [93] and AI-powered Bing Chat in the taskbar's search field [132] Following the integration of GPT-4 in Microsoft's other products, the company announced that by summer 2023, the newly released Microsoft Copilot would add GPT-4 integration to the Windows taskbar [133]\n\n\nEditions\nWindows 11 is available in two main editions;

later decided to seek nomination at the convention; on the day of the convention, she acknowledged that if she did not win the nomination, she may reconsider and run as an independent, although she eventually decided against this [80] Faced with pressure from the Chase campaign and activists to return to a primary, the state committee debated scrapping the convention on January 23, 2021 These efforts were unsuccessful and the party reaffirmed their decision to hold a convention [81] On February 9, 2021, the Chase campaign sued the Republican Party of Virginia, arguing that the convention is illegal under COVID-19-related executive orders signed by Governor Ralph Northam [82] The Richmond Circuit Court dismissed the Chase campaign's lawsuit on February 19, 2021 [83] The Republican Party of Virginia announced on March 26, 2021, that seven gubernatorial candidates had qualified to appear on the convention ballot [84] On April 11, 2021, the state Republican Party Rules Committee

Virginia without Loudoun County, and the first time since the 1960 presidential election that a Republican won statewide without Prince William County This is the first time Surry County backed the Republican candidate since John Warner's largely uncontested re-election in 2002 and the first time Prince Edward County or Northampton County voted Republican since 2009 This is also the first time any Virginia statewide candidate has won without at least one of the three Northern Virginia counties of Loudoun, Prince William, Fairfax, or the independent cities therein Over 3.28 million votes

gubernatorial election was held on November 2, 2021, to elect the Governor of Virginia. The election was contested between Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic nominee, and Glenn Youngkin, the Republican nominee.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe 2021 Virginia gubernatorial election was a highly contested and closely watched election, with both parties investing significant resources in the campaign. The election was seen as a bellwether for the 2022 midterm elections and was closely watched by national media and political analysts. The election was also historic in that it was the first gubernatorial election in Virginia to be held since the state's voting laws were changed to allow for early voting and absentee voting.\n\n**Democratic Primary**\n\nIn the Democratic primary, Terry McAuliffe, a former Governor of Virginia, won the nomination. McAuliffe had previously served as Governor from 2014 to 2018 and had been a prominent figure in Virginia politics for many years. He won the nomination with a significant margin, defeating several other candidates who had also sought the nomination.\n\n**Federal Officials**\n\nDuring the campaign, McAuliffe's campaign received endorsements from several federal officials, including President Joe Biden and Senator Mark Warner. McAuliffe also received significant financial support from the Democratic Party and from several unions and special interest groups.\n\n**Candidates**\n\nTerry McAuliffe was the nominee of the Democratic Party and was seen as the front-runner in the election. McAuliffe had a strong track record as Governor and had been a prominent figure in Virginia politics for many years. He was seen as a strong candidate and was expected to win the election.\n\n**Nominee**\n\nGlenn Youngkin was the nominee of the Republican Party. Youngkin was a businessman who had never held public office before. He was seen as a conservative candidate who was popular with the Republican base. Youngkin won the nomination at the Republican convention and went on to face McAuliffe in the general election.\n\n**Nominated at Convention**\n\nYoungkin won the nomination at the Republican convention with a significant margin. He was seen as a strong candidate and was expected to be competitive in the general election.\n\n**Eliminated at Convention**\n\nSeveral other candidates also sought the Republican nomination, but were eliminated at the convention. These candidates included several notable Republicans who had also sought the nomination.\n\n**Did Not Qualify**\n\nOne candidate, Amanda Chase, did not qualify for the convention ballot. Chase was a state senator who had also sought the nomination.\n\n**Declined**\n\nSeveral other candidates declined to seek the nomination, including one notable Republican who had also sought the nomination.\n\n**Endorsements**\n\nDuring the campaign, Youngkin's campaign received endorsements from several federal officials, including Senator Tim Scott and Representative Dan Crenshaw. Youngkin also received significant financial support from the Republican Party and from several special interest groups.\n\n**Polling**\n\nThroughout the campaign, polling showed a close contest between McAuliffe and Youngkin. The two candidates were neck and neck in many polls, with some showing McAuliffe with a slight lead and others showing Youngkin with a slight lead.\n\n**Graphical Summary**\n\nThe polling showed a close contest between the two candidates, with neither able to gain a significant advantage.\n\n**Primary Polling**\n\nThe polling also showed that both candidates had strong support from their respective bases, but that McAuliffe had a slight edge among independent voters.\n\n**Convention Polling**\n\nThe polling also showed that Youngkin had a strong advantage among Republican voters, but that McAuliffe had a slight edge among Democratic voters.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe election was held on November 2, 2021, and was widely contested. The results of the election were as follows:\n\n* Glenn Youngkin: 1,725,127 (50.6%)\n* Terry McAuliffe: 1,671,463 (48.6%)\n\n**Independent Cities**\n\nThe election was also contested in several independent cities in Virginia, including Richmond and Norfolk.

These included the following:\n\n* Virginia's 2nd congressional district, which was previously won by Ralph Northam in 2017\n* Surry County, which had not voted Republican since 2002\n* Prince Edward County, which had not voted Republican since 2009\n* Northampton County, which had not voted Republican since 2009\n\n**By Region and Precinct**\n\nThe election was also contested in several regions and precincts in Virginia, including the following:\n\n* Northern Virginia: Youngkin: 52.4%; McAuliffe: 45.6%\n* Hampton Roads: Youngkin: 51.3%; McAuliffe: 46.8%\n* Richmond: Youngkin: 50.4%; McAuliffe: 46.7%\n\n**By Congressional District**\n\nThe election was also contested in several congressional districts in Virginia, including the following:\n\n* Virginia's 2nd congressional district: Youngkin: 52.4%; McAuliffe: 45.6%\n* Virginia's 5th congressional district: Youngkin: 53.2%; McAuliffe: 44.5%\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe election was widely contested and was seen as a bellwether for the 2022 midterm elections.

Virginia [76] [77] On December 5, 2020, the state Republican Party voted to hold a convention instead of a primary by a vote of 39 to 35 [78] State Senator Amanda Chase initially indicated that she would run as an independent, [79] but she later decided to seek nomination at the convention; on the day of the convention, she acknowledged that if she did not win the nomination, she may reconsider and run as an independent, although she eventually decided against this [80] Faced with pressure from the Chase campaign and activists to return to a primary, the state committee debated scrapping the convention on January 23, 2021 These efforts were unsuccessful and the party reaffirmed their decision to hold a convention [81] On February 9, 2021, the Chase campaign sued the Republican Party of Virginia, arguing that the convention is illegal under COVID-19-related executive orders signed by Governor Ralph Northam [82] The Richmond Circuit Court dismissed the Chase campaign's lawsuit on February 19, 2021 [83] The Republican Party of Virginia announced on March 26, 2021, that seven gubernatorial candidates had qualified to appear on the convention ballot [84] On April 11, 2021, the

wife, Lota Cloy (née Hatfield) Knight [5] [6] [7] He grew up in the Portland neighborhood of Eastmoreland, and attended Cleveland High School According to one source, \"When his father refused to give him a summer job at his newspaper  [the now defunct Oregon Journal], believing that his son should find work on his own,\" Knight \"went to the rival Oregonian, where he worked the morning shift tabulating sports scores and every morning ran home the full seven miles.\" [8]\n\n\nCareer\nBefore Blue Ribbon Sports—later Nike—flourished, Knight worked as a  Certified Public Accountant, first with Coopers & Lybrand, and then Price Waterhouse Knight then became an accounting professor at Portland State University [13]\n\n\nEarly career\nBefore Blue Ribbon Sports—later Nike—flourished, Knight worked as a  Certified Public Accountant, first with Coopers & Lybrand, and then Price Waterhouse Knight then became an accounting professor at Portland State University [13]\n\n\nNike Inc.\nImmediately after graduating from the University of Oregon, Knight enlisted in the Army and served one year on active duty and seven years in the Army Reserve [5] He next enrolled at Stanford Graduate School of Business, [5] where, for his small business class, Knight produced a paper, \"Can Japanese Sports Shoes Do to German Sports Shoes What Japanese Cameras Did to German Cameras?\", that essentially foretold his eventual foray into selling running shoes His ambition was to import high-quality and low-cost running shoes from Japan into the American market He graduated with a master's degree in business administration from Stanford in 1962 [5]\n\n\nVinton Studios becomes Laika\nFollowing mainstream success in the late 1990s, Will Vinton Studios animation company sought external investors due to rapid growth Knight assumed a 15 percent stake in the company in 1998, and his son Travis—who had graduated from Portland State following an unsuccessful attempt at a rap music career—went to work at the studio as an animator [22]\n\n\nDeath of Matthew Knight\nIn May 2004, two years after Knight bought Vinton, his son Matthew, aged 34 years, traveled to El Salvador to film a fund-raising video for Christian Children of the World, a Portland nonprofit organization However, while scuba diving with his colleagues Vincenzo Iannuzzelli and Robert McDonell in Lake Ilopango, near San Salvador, he died from a heart attack 150 feet (46 m) underwater due to an undetected congenital heart defect [24] Knight and Travis traveled to El Salvador to return Matthew's body to the US [23] Laika Studio's 2005 short film Moongirl was dedicated to Matthew's memory [25]\n\n\nPost-Nike CEO role\nDuring the 2009–2010 period, Knight was the largest single contributor to the campaign to defeat Oregon Ballot Measures 66 and 67, which, once passed, increased income tax on some corporations and high-income individuals [30]\n\n\nMemoir\nKnight's memoir, Shoe Dog, was released on April 26, 2016, by Simon & Schuster, was rated fifth on The New York Times Best Seller list for business books in July 2018, [35] and details the building of the Nike brand, from importing Japanese shoes to being part of a federal investigation [36] [37]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nAs of July 2021, Knight has a net worth of $60.8 billion [38] In 1990, Knight founded the Philip H Knight Charitable Foundation Trust [39] As of 2016, according to Portland Business Journal, \"Knight is the most generous philanthropist in Oregon history His lifetime gifts now approach $2 billion.\" [40] In 2023, Knight was America's second largest donor with $1.2 billion in giving [41]\n\n\nStanford University\nIn 2006, Knight donated US$105 million to the Stanford Graduate School of Business, which, at the time, was the largest ever individual donation to a U.S business school The campus was named \"The Knight Management Center,\" in honor of Knight's philanthropic service to the school [42]\n\n\nUniversity of Oregon\nAs of 2023, Knight has donated over one billion dollars to the University of Oregon [48] It is believed that Knight made his first major contribution in the late 1980s [49] By 2000 Knight had already contributed over $50 million to UO [50] He was UO's 2018-2019 honorary degree recipient [51]\n\n\nUO Academics\nMajor gifts include funds supporting the renovation of the Knight Library and construction of the Knight Law Center Contrary to press reports, which claim that Knight financed the whole library renovation project, Knight only financed a portion of the library's renovation [52] [53] [49] Knight also established endowed chairs across the campus [54] In the fall of 2016, it was announced that Knight will donate $500 million to UO for a new three-building laboratory and research science complex [55] This donation was part of a series of large higher-education gifts [56]\n\n\nUO Athletic Department (Oregon Ducks)\nKnight contributed towards the Moshofsky Center, which opened in 1998 [57] [52]\n\n\nControversy\nKnight's contributions to the athletic department at UO have also led to controversy [66] In April 2000, student leaders began organizing an anti-sweatshop and fair labor practices campaign, and called for Dave Frohnmayer, president of the school, to support the Workers Rights Consortium (WRC) On April 4, 2000, students began a sit-in at Johnson Hall, the UO's administrative center In early April, an open meeting of students further demanded that the organization Fair Labor Association (FLA) would receive no consideration from the university, as it was perceived as a group founded, funded and backed by Nike and other corporations, and had also been criticized by worker rights advocates as an exercise in dishonest public relations [67] [68]\n\n\nOther projects\nIn October 2008, Knight and his wife pledged US$100 million to the OHSU Cancer Institute, the largest gift in the history of Oregon Health & Science University In recognition, the university renamed the organization the \"OHSU Knight Cancer Institute.\" [77]\n\n\nAccolades\nIn 2000, Knight was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame for his Special Contribution to Sports in Oregon [86] At the time of his induction, he had contributed approximately US$230 million to UO, the majority of which was for athletics [87]\n\n\nPersonal life\nKnight met his wife, Penelope \"Penny\" Parks, while he was working at Portland State University and they were married on September 13, 1968 [93] They own a home in La Quinta, California [94] [95]\n\n\nPolitics\nKnight is a registered Republican and a frequent contributor to Republican political candidates in Oregon In 2010, he donated $400,000 to Chris Dudley, the then Republican nominee for Governor of Oregon.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Phil Knight**\n\nPhil Knight is an American businessman,

He next enrolled at Stanford Graduate School of Business, where he produced a paper for his small business class, \"Can Japanese Sports Shoes Do to German Sports Shoes What Japanese Cameras Did to German Cameras?\", that essentially foretold his eventual foray into selling running shoes. Knight's ambition was to import high-quality and low-cost running shoes from Japan into the American market. He graduated with a master's degree in business administration from Stanford in 1962.\n\n**Vinton Studios becomes Laika**\n\nFollowing mainstream success in the late 1990s, Will Vinton Studios animation company sought external investors due to rapid growth.

On April 4, 2000, students began a sit-in at Johnson Hall, the UO's administrative center. An open meeting of students further demanded that the organization Fair Labor Association (FLA) would receive no consideration from the university, as it was perceived as a group founded, funded, and backed by Nike and other corporations, and had also been criticized by worker rights advocates as an exercise in dishonest public relations.\n\n**Other Projects**\n\nIn October 2008, Knight and his wife pledged $100 million to the OHSU Cancer Institute, the largest gift in the history of Oregon Health & Science University. In recognition, the university renamed the organization the \"OHSU Knight Cancer Institute.\"\n\n**Accolades**\n\nIn 2000, Knight was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame for his Special Contribution to Sports in Oregon.

Z (French, 1969); The Emigrants (Swedish, 1972); Cries and Whispers (Swedish, 1973); The Postman (Il Postino) (Italian/Spanish, 1995); Life Is Beautiful (Italian, 1998); Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Mandarin Chinese, 2000); Letters from Iwo Jima (Japanese, 2006, but ineligible for Best Foreign Language Film because it was an American production); Amour (French, 2012); Roma (Spanish/Mixtec, 2018); Parasite (Korean, 2019); Minari (Korean, 2020, but ineligible for Best International Feature Film because it was an American production); [23] Drive My Car (Japanese/Korean/Mandarin Chinese/German/Korean Sign Language, 2021), All Quiet on the Western Front (German, 2022), Anatomy of a Fall (French, 2023), Past Lives (Korean, 2023, but ineligible for Best International Feature Film because it was an American production), and The Zone of Interest (German/Polish/Yiddish, 2023) Parasite became the first film not in English to win Best Picture [24] [25]\n\n\nRating\nSince 1968, most Best Picture winners have been rated R under the Motion Picture Association's rating system Oliver! is the only G-rated film and Midnight Cowboy is the only X-rated film (what is categorized as an NC-17 film today), so far, to win Best Picture; they won in back-to-back years, 1968 and 1969 The latter has since been changed to an R rating Eleven films have won with a PG rating: the first was Patton (1970) and the most recent was Driving Miss Daisy (1989) Eleven more films have won with a PG-13 rating (which was introduced in 1984): the first was The Last Emperor (1987) and the most recent was CODA (2021).\n\n\nGenres and mediums\nThree animated films have been nominated for Best Picture: Beauty and the Beast (1991), Up (2009) and Toy Story 3 (2010) The latter two were nominated after the Academy expanded the number of nominees, but none have won.\n\n\nSequel nominations and winners\nNine films that were presented as direct sequels have been nominated for Best Picture: The Bells of St Mary's (1945; the sequel to the 1944 winner, Going My Way), The Godfather Part II (1974), The Godfather Part III (1990), The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002), The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), Toy Story 3 (2010), Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), Avatar: The Way of Water (2022) and Top Gun: Maverick (2022).\n\n\nRemake nominations and winners\nAlong similar lines to sequels, there have been few nominees and winners that are either remakes or adaptations of the same source materials or subjects.\n\n\nSilent film winners\nAt the 1st Academy Awards, the Best Picture award (then named \"Academy Award for Outstanding Picture\") was presented to the 1927 silent film Wings.\n\n\nVersion availability\nNo Best Picture winner has been lost, though a few such as All Quiet on the Western Front and Lawrence of Arabia exist only in a form altered from their original, award-winning release form This has usually been due to editing for reissue (and subsequently partly restored by archivists) Other winners and nominees, such as Tom Jones (prior to its 2018 reissues by The Criterion Collection and the British Film Institute) and Star Wars, are widely available only in subsequently altered versions The Broadway Melody originally had some sequences photographed in two-color Technicolor This footage survives only in black and white [34]\n\n\nDiversity standards\nThe Academy has established a set of \"representation and inclusion standards\", called Academy Aperture 2025, which a film will be required to satisfy in order to compete in the Best Picture category, starting with the 96th Academy Awards for films released in 2023 [38] [39] There are four general standards, of which a film must satisfy two to be considered for Best Picture: (a) on-screen representation, themes and narratives; (b) creative leadership and project team; (c) industry access and opportunities; and (d) audience development [38] As explained by Vox, the standards \"basically break down into two big buckets: standards promoting more inclusive representation and standards promoting more inclusive employment\" [40] The standards are intended to provide greater opportunities for employment, in cast, crew, studio apprenticeships and internships, and development, marketing, publicity, and distribution executives, among underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, women, LGBTQ+ people, and persons with cognitive or physical disabilities (not counting developmental disabilities like the autism spectrum), or who are deaf or hard of hearing [38] [41]\n\n\n2016 ceremony mistake\nAt the 89th Academy Awards on February 26, 2017, presenter Faye Dunaway read La La Land as the winner of the award However, she and Warren Beatty had mistakenly been given the duplicate envelope for the \"Best Actress in a Leading Role\" award, which Emma Stone had won for her role in La La Land While accepting the award, La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz, who was given the correct envelope, realized the mistake and announced that Moonlight had won the award [42]\n\n\nWinners and nominees\nIn the list below, winners are listed first in the gold row, followed by the other nominees [6] Except for the early years (when the Academy used a non-calendar year), the year shown is the one in which the film first premiered in Los Angeles County, California;

The award is considered the highest honor in the film industry and is often seen as the pinnacle of achievement in cinematic storytelling.\n\n**History**\n\nAt the 1st Academy Awards ceremony held in 1929 (for films made in 1927 and 1928), there were two categories of awards that were each considered the top award of the night: \"Outstanding Picture\" and \"Unique and Artistic Picture\", the former being won by the war epic Wings, and the latter by the art film Sunrise. Each award was intended to honor different and equally important aspects of superior filmmaking. In particular, The Jazz Singer was disqualified from both awards, since its use of synchronized sound made the film a sui generis item that would have unfairly competed against either category, and the Academy granted the film an honorary award instead.\n\n**Category Name Changes**\n\nAt the 1st Academy Awards ceremony held in 1929 (for films made in 1927 and 1928), there were two categories of awards that were each considered the top award of the night: \"Outstanding Picture\" and \"Unique and Artistic Picture\", the former being won by the war epic Wings, and the latter by the art film Sunrise. Each award was intended to honor different and equally important aspects of superior filmmaking. In particular, The Jazz Singer was disqualified from both awards, since its use of synchronized sound made the film a sui generis item that would have unfairly competed against either category, and the Academy granted the film an honorary award instead.\n\n**Recipients**\n\nUntil 1950, this award was presented to a representative of the production company. That year the protocol was changed so that the award was presented to all credited producers. This rule was modified in 1999 to apply a maximum limit of three producers receiving the award, after the five producers of Shakespeare in Love had received the award.\n\n**Best Picture and Best Director**\n\nThe Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director have been closely linked throughout their history. Of the 96 films that have won Best Picture, 69 have also been awarded Best Director. Only six films have been awarded Best Picture without receiving a Best Director nomination: Wings directed by William A. Wellman (1927/28), Grand Hotel directed by Edmund Goulding (1931/32), Driving Miss Daisy directed by Bruce Beresford (1989), Argo directed by Ben Affleck (2012), Green Book directed by Peter Farrelly (2018), and CODA directed by Sian Heder (2021). The only two Best Director winners to win for films that did not receive a Best Picture nomination were during the early years of the awards: Lewis Milestone for Two Arabian Knights (1927/28), and Frank Lloyd for The Divine Lady (1928/29).\n\n**Nomination Limit Increased**\n\nOn June 24, 2009, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) announced that the number of films to be nominated in the Best Picture award category would increase from 5 to 10, starting with the 82nd Academy Awards (2009). Although the Academy never officially said so, many commenters noted the expansion was likely in part a response to public criticism of The Dark Knight and WALL-E (both 2008) (and, in previous years, other blockbusters and popular films) not being nominated for Best Picture. Officially, the Academy said the rule change was a throwback to the Academy's early years in the 1930s and 1940s, when 8 to 12 films were nominated each year.\n\n**Language and Country of Origin**\n\nSeventeen non-English language films have been nominated in the category: La Grande Illusion (French, 1938); Z (French, 1969); The Emigrants (Swedish, 1972); Cries and Whispers (Swedish, 1973); The Postman (Il Postino) (Italian/Spanish, 1995); Life Is Beautiful (Italian, 1998); Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Mandarin Chinese, 2000); Letters from Iwo Jima (Japanese, 2006, but ineligible for Best Foreign Language Film because it was an American production); Amour (French, 2012); Roma (Spanish/Mixtec, 2018); Parasite (Korean, 2019); Minari (Korean, 2020, but ineligible for Best International Feature Film because it was an American production); Drive My Car (Japanese/Korean/Mandarin Chinese/German/Korean Sign Language, 2021), All Quiet on the Western Front (German, 2022), Anatomy of a Fall (French, 2023), Past Lives (Korean, 2023, but ineligible for Best International Feature Film because it was an American production), and The Zone of Interest (German/Polish/Yiddish, 2023). Parasite became the first film not in English to win Best Picture.\n\n**Rating**\n\nSince 1968, most Best Picture winners have been rated R under the Motion Picture Association's rating system. Oliver! is the only G-rated film and Midnight Cowboy is the only X-rated film (what is categorized as an NC-17 film today), so far, to win Best Picture; they won in back-to-back years, 1968 and 1969. The latter has since been changed to an R rating. Eleven films have won with a PG rating: the first was Patton (1970) and the most recent was Driving Miss Daisy (1989). Eleven more films have won with a PG-13 rating (which was introduced in 1984): the first was The Last Emperor (1987) and the most recent was CODA (2021).\n\n**Genres and Mediums**\n\nThree animated films have been nominated for Best Picture: Beauty and the Beast (1991), Up (2009) and Toy Story 3 (2010). The latter two were nominated after the Academy expanded the number of nominees, but none have won.\n\n**Sequel Nominations and Winners**\n\nNine films that were presented as direct sequels have been nominated for Best Picture: The Bells of St. Mary's (1945; the sequel to the 1944 winner, Going My Way), The Godfather Part II (1974), The Godfather Part III (1990), The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002), The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), Toy Story 3 (2010), Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), Avatar: The Way of Water (2022) and Top Gun: Maverick (2022).\n\n**Remake Nominations and Winners**\n\nAlong similar lines to sequels, there have been few nominees and winners that are either remakes or adaptations of the same source materials or subjects.\n\n**Silent Film Winners**\n\nAt the 1st Academy Awards, the Best Picture award (then named \"Academy Award for Outstanding Picture\") was presented to the 1927 silent film Wings.\n\n**Version Availability**\n\nNo Best Picture winner has been lost, though a few such as All Quiet on the Western Front and Lawrence of Arabia exist only in a form altered from their original, award-winning release form. This has usually been due to editing for reissue (and subsequently partly restored by archivists). Other winners and nominees, such as Tom Jones (prior to its 2018 reissues by The Criterion Collection and the British Film Institute) and Star Wars, are widely available only in subsequently altered versions. The Broadway Melody originally had some sequences photographed in two-color Technicolor. This footage survives only in black and white.\n\n**Diversity Standards**\n\nThe Academy has established a set of \"representation and inclusion standards\", called Academy Aperture 2025, which a film will be required to satisfy in order to compete in the Best Picture category, starting with the 96th Academy Awards for films released in 2023. There are four general standards, of which a film must satisfy two to be considered for Best Picture: (a) on-screen representation, themes and narratives; (b) creative leadership and project team; (c) industry access and opportunities; and (d) audience development. As explained by Vox, the standards \"basically break down into two big buckets: standards promoting more inclusive representation and standards promoting more inclusive employment\". The standards are intended to provide greater opportunities for employment, in cast, crew, studio apprenticeships and internships, and development, marketing, publicity, and distribution executives, among underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, women, LGBTQ+ people, and persons with cognitive or physical disabilities (not counting developmental disabilities like the autism spectrum), or who are deaf or hard of hearing.\n\n**2016 Ceremony Mistake**\n\nAt the 89th Academy Awards on February 26, 2017, presenter Faye Dunaway read La La Land as the winner of the award. However, she and Warren Beatty had mistakenly been given the duplicate envelope for the \"Best Actress in a Leading Role\" award, which Emma Stone had won for her role in La La Land. While accepting the award, La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz, who was given the correct envelope, realized the mistake and announced that Moonlight had won the award.\n\n**Winners and Nominees**\n\nIn the list below, winners are listed first in the gold row, followed by the other nominees. Except for the early years (when the Academy used a non-calendar year), the year shown is the one in which the film first premiered in Los Angeles County, California; normally this is also the year of first release; however, it may be the year after first release (as with Casablanca and, if the film-festival premiere is considered, Crash and The Hurt Locker).

Z (French, 1969); The Emigrants (Swedish, 1972); Cries and Whispers (Swedish, 1973); The Postman (Il Postino) (Italian/Spanish, 1995); Life Is Beautiful (Italian, 1998); Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Mandarin Chinese, 2000); Letters from Iwo Jima (Japanese, 2006, but ineligible for Best Foreign Language Film because it was an American production); Amour (French, 2012); Roma (Spanish/Mixtec, 2018); Parasite (Korean, 2019); Minari (Korean, 2020, but ineligible for Best International Feature Film because it was an American production); [23] Drive My Car (Japanese/Korean/Mandarin Chinese/German/Korean Sign Language, 2021), All Quiet on the Western Front (German, 2022), Anatomy of a Fall (French, 2023), Past Lives (Korean, 2023, but ineligible for Best International Feature Film because it was an American production), and The Zone of Interest (German/Polish/Yiddish, 2023) Parasite became the first film not in English to win Best Picture [24] [25]\n\n\nRating\nSince 1968, most Best Picture winners have been rated R under the Motion Picture Association's rating system Oliver! is the only G-rated film and Midnight Cowboy is the only X-rated film (what is categorized as an NC-17 film today), so far, to win Best Picture; they won in back-to-back years, 1968 and 1969 The latter has since been changed to an R rating Eleven films have won with a PG rating: the first was Patton (1970) and the most recent was Driving Miss Daisy (1989) Eleven more films have won with a PG-13 rating (which was introduced in 1984): the first was The Last Emperor (1987) and the most recent was CODA (2021).\n\n\nGenres and mediums\nThree animated films have been nominated for Best Picture: Beauty and the Beast (1991), Up (2009) and Toy Story 3 (2010) The latter two were nominated after the Academy expanded the number of nominees, but none have won.\n\n\nSequel nominations and winners\nNine films that were presented as direct sequels have been nominated for Best Picture: The Bells of St Mary's (1945; the sequel to the 1944 winner, Going My Way), The Godfather Part II (1974), The Godfather Part III (1990), The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002), The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), Toy Story 3 (2010), Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), Avatar: The Way of Water (2022) and Top Gun: Maverick (2022).\n\n\nRemake nominations and winners\nAlong similar lines to sequels, there have been few nominees and winners that are either remakes or adaptations of the same source materials or subjects.\n\n\nSilent film winners\nAt the 1st Academy Awards, the Best Picture award (then named \"Academy Award for Outstanding Picture\") was presented to the 1927 silent film Wings.\n\n\nVersion availability\nNo Best Picture winner has been lost, though a few such as All Quiet on the Western Front and Lawrence of Arabia exist only in a form altered from their original, award-winning release form This has usually been due to editing for reissue (and subsequently partly restored by archivists) Other winners and nominees, such as Tom Jones (prior to its 2018 reissues by The Criterion Collection and the British Film Institute) and Star Wars, are widely available only in subsequently altered versions The Broadway Melody originally had some sequences photographed in two-color Technicolor This footage survives only in black and white [34]\n\n\nDiversity standards\nThe Academy has established a set of \"representation and inclusion standards\", called Academy Aperture 2025, which a film will be required to satisfy in order to compete in the Best Picture category, starting with the 96th Academy Awards for films released in 2023 [38] [39] There are four general standards, of which a film must satisfy two to be considered for Best Picture: (a) on-screen representation, themes and narratives; (b) creative leadership and project team; (c) industry access and opportunities; and (d) audience development [38] As explained by Vox, the standards \"basically break down into two big buckets: standards promoting more inclusive representation and standards promoting more inclusive employment\" [40] The standards are intended to provide greater opportunities for employment, in cast, crew, studio apprenticeships and internships, and development, marketing, publicity, and distribution executives, among underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, women, LGBTQ+ people, and persons with cognitive or physical disabilities (not counting developmental disabilities like the autism spectrum), or who are deaf or hard of hearing [38] [41]\n\n\n2016 ceremony mistake\nAt the 89th Academy Awards on February 26, 2017, presenter Faye Dunaway read La La Land as the winner of the award However, she and Warren Beatty had mistakenly been given the duplicate envelope for the \"Best Actress in a Leading Role\" award, which Emma Stone had won for her role in La La Land While accepting the award, La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz, who was given the correct envelope, realized the mistake and announced that Moonlight had won the award [42]\n\n\nWinners and nominees\nIn the list below, winners are listed first in the gold row, followed by the other nominees [6] Except for the early years (when the Academy used a non-calendar year), the year shown is the one in which the film first premiered in Los Angeles County, California; normally this is also the year of first release; however, it may be the year after first release (as with Casablanca and, if the film-festival premiere is considered, Crash and The Hurt Locker) This is also the year before the ceremony at which the award is given; for example, a film exhibited theatrically during 2005 was eligible for consideration for the 2005 Best Picture Oscar, awarded in 2006 The number of the ceremony (1st, 2nd, etc.) appears in parentheses after the awards year, linked to the article on that ceremony Each individual entry shows the title followed by nominee.\n\n\n1920s\n\n\n\n1930s\n\n\n\n1940s\n\n\n\n1950s\n\n\n\n1960s\n\n\n\n1970s\n\n\n\n1980s\n\n\n\n1990s\n\n\n\n2000s\n\n\n\n2010s\n\n\n\n2020s\n\n\n\nIndividuals with multiple wins\n\n\n\nIndividuals with multiple nominations\n\n\n\nProduction companies and distributors with multiple nominations and wins\nColumbia Pictures and United Artists have the most wins with 12, while 20th Century Studios has the most nominations with 64 Focus Features has the most nominations without a win with 16.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The competition was established in 1949 and has been held biennially since then, with the exception of the 2020 edition, which was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Thomas Cup competition was the idea of Sir George Alan Thomas, a highly successful English badminton player of the early 1900s, who was inspired by tennis's Davis Cup and football's (soccer's) World Cup first held in 1930. His idea was well received at the general meeting of the International Badminton Federation (IBF), now known as the Badminton World Federation (BWF), in 1939.\n\n**First Thomas Cup**\n\nThe first Thomas Cup competition was held in 1949, with five teams competing: England, Denmark, Egypt, India, and Malaya (now known as Malaysia). Malaya won the inaugural title, defeating England in the final.\n\n**Development**\n\nDuring the next several Thomas Cup competitions, the number of participating countries grew, and a fourth qualifying zone was added. The former Pacific zone was converted into Asian and Australasian zones for the 1954-1955 tournament. Starting with the second tournament in 1951-1952, zone winners contested to determine a challenger for the reigning champion. Until 1964, the Cup-holding nation always hosted these inter-zone ties but was exempt from them, and from the earlier intra-zone matches, needing only to defend its title, at home, in a single, conclusive challenge round tie.\n\n**Revised Format**\n\nIn the early 1980s, the IBF (BWF) revamped the formats of both Thomas Cup and the women's world team championship, the Uber Cup. Starting in 1984, they were held concurrently, every two years, not three, with equivalent phases of the two competitions held at the same venues and times. Ties at all stages of the Thomas Cup were trimmed from nine matches to five, played in one day, not two. Lineups continued to consist of three singles players and two doubles teams, but each now played a single match against the opposing team's counterpart.\n\n**Qualification**\n\nThe old knockout (single elimination) zone qualification system, in which each tie was played at a separate venue and time, was eliminated. Instead, common qualifying venues brought many teams together to contend in group round-robin ties followed by playoffs between group leaders. As few as one or as many as three teams from a given venue (depending on the previously assessed strength of its field) would qualify for the final phase of the competition, which until 2004 was limited to eight teams. The number of qualifying venues prior to 2004 varied between two and four, and their sites basically reflected the long-existent loci of badminton strength in the Far East and (to a lesser extent) in Europe.\n\n**Final Tournament**\n\nFrom 1984 through 2002, the final phase of Thomas Cup competition brought eight competing teams together. These included the defending champion and the host nation exempt from earlier qualification ties. The format of this final phase largely mirrored that of the qualifying venues. The eight teams were divided into pools or groups of four. Round-robin play within each group determined first and second place group finishers, who then advanced to the semifinals. Each semifinal tie pitted the top finisher in one group against the second-place finisher in the other, with the winners proceeding to the championship match. A playoff for third place between losing semifinalists was instituted in 1984 but was dropped in 1990.\n\n**Results**\n\nOnly six countries, Malaysia (formerly Malaya), Indonesia, China, Japan, Denmark, and India, have ever won the Thomas Cup. The first three each won the first competition that it entered: Malaya, the initial contest in 1949; Indonesia, the 1958 contest against Malaya; and China, the 1982 contest over Indonesia.\n\n**1949-1982**\n\nThe first Thomas Cup competition was held in 1949, with five teams competing: England, Denmark, Egypt, India, and Malaya (now known as Malaysia). Malaya won the inaugural title, defeating England in the final. Indonesia won its first Thomas Cup in 1958, defeating Malaya in the final. China won its first Thomas Cup in 1982, defeating Indonesia in the final.\n\n**1984-1988**\n\nChina continued its winning streak, winning its third consecutive Thomas Cup in 1988. Malaysia and Indonesia also won Thomas Cups during this period, with Malaysia winning in 1984 and Indonesia winning in 1986.\n\n**1990-Present**\n\nDenmark won its first Thomas Cup in 1996, defeating Indonesia in the final. China won its fourth Thomas Cup in 1998, defeating Indonesia in the final. Malaysia won its fifth Thomas Cup in 2000, defeating China in the final. China won its sixth Thomas Cup in 2002, defeating Malaysia in the final.\n\n**Successful National Teams**\n\nOnly six countries, Malaysia (formerly Malaya), Indonesia, China, Japan, Denmark, and India, have ever won the Thomas Cup. The first three each won the first competition that it entered: Malaya, the initial contest in 1949; Indonesia, the 1958 contest against Malaya; and China, the 1982 contest over Indonesia.\n\n**Team Appearances at the Final Stages**\n\nAs of the 2022 championship, 29 teams have advanced to the final tournaments over the competition's history. Among them, Denmark has reached this final stage in all 32 competitions (and without ever receiving a bye to it). Indonesia and China have also advanced to the final stage in each competition that they have entered. Geographically, 10 Asian nations have qualified to play at the final venue. Nine European nations have done so. The United States, Canada, Peru, and Mexico are the only Pan-American teams to have reached this stage. New Zealand, Australia, and Tahiti have been the only teams to represent Oceania. South Africa, Nigeria, and Algeria have qualified from the African zone.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe Thomas Cup has been held 24 times since its inception in 1949. The competition has been contested by 29 teams, with the first three teams winning the first competition they entered. The Thomas Cup has been won by six countries: Malaysia, Indonesia, China, Japan, Denmark, and India.

{"title": "War_in_Afghanistan_(2001–2021)", "content": "\nNames\nThis twenty-year armed conflict (2001–2021) is referred to as the War in Afghanistan [94] in order to distinguish it from the country's various other wars, [95] notably the ongoing Afghan conflict of which it was a part, [96] and the Soviet–Afghan War [97] [full citation needed] From the perspective of the West, the war is divided between 2001 and 2014 (the ISAF mission), when most combat operations were performed by coalition forces, a 2015 to 2021 (the Resolute Support Mission), when the Afghan armed forces did most of the fighting against the Taliban [citation needed] The war was named Operation Enduring Freedom from 2001 to 2014 [98] and as Operation Freedom's Sentinel from 2015 to 2021 by the US [99] Alternatively, it has been called the US War in Afghanistan [100] [101] [102] In Afghanistan itself, the war is known as simply the \"War in Afghanistan\" (Dari: جنگ در افغانستان Jang dar Afghanistan, Pashto: د افغانستان جګړه Da Afghanistan Jagra) [103] [104] [105]\n\n\nPrelude\nThe Taliban emerged from religious students known as the Talib who sought to end warlordism in Afghanistan through stricter adherence to Sharia [106] [107] On 27 September 1996, the Taliban, with military support by Pakistan and financial support from Saudi Arabia, seized Kabul and founded the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan [108] The Taliban imposed their fundamentalist Deobandi interpretation of Islam in areas under their control, issuing edicts forbidding women to work outside the home, attend school or to leave their homes unless accompanied by a male relative [109] According to the United Nations (UN), the Taliban, while trying to consolidate control over northern and western Afghanistan, committed systematic massacres against civilians UN officials stated that there had been \"15 massacres\" between 1996 and 2001, many of them targeting Shias and Hazaras [110] [111]\n\n\nRise of the Taliban\nThe Taliban emerged from religious students known as the Talib who sought to end warlordism in Afghanistan through stricter adherence to Sharia [106] [107] On 27 September 1996, the Taliban, with military support by Pakistan and financial support from Saudi Arabia, seized Kabul and founded the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan [108] The Taliban imposed their fundamentalist Deobandi

there had been \"15 massacres\" between 1996 and 2001, many of them targeting Shias and Hazaras [110] [111]\n\n\nAl-Qaeda\nThe 9/11 Commission in the US found that under the Taliban, Al-Qaeda was able to use Afghanistan as a place to train and teach fighters, import weapons, coordinate with other jihadists, and plot terrorist actions [116] While Al-Qaeda maintained its own camps in Afghanistan, it also supported training camps of other organizations An estimated 10,000 to 20,000 men passed through these facilities before 9/11, most of whom were sent to fight for the Taliban against the United Front A smaller number were inducted into Al-Qaeda [117]\n\n\nSeptember 11 attacks\nOn the morning of Tuesday, September 11, 2001, a total of 19 men affiliated with Al-Qaeda carried out four coordinated attacks in the United States Four commercial passenger jet airliners were hijacked [119] [120] The hijackers intentionally crashed two of the airliners into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, killing everyone on board and more than 2,000 people in the buildings Both buildings collapsed within two hours from damage related to the crashes, destroying and damaging nearby buildings The hijackers crashed a third airliner into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C The fourth plane crashed into a field near Shanksville, in rural Pennsylvania, after some of its passengers and flight crew attempted to retake control of the plane, which the hijackers had redirected toward Washington, D.C., to target the White House, or the US Capitol No one aboard the flights survived The death toll among responders including firefighters and police was 836 as of 2009 [121] Total deaths were 2,996, including the 19 hijackers [121]\n\n\nUS ultimatum to the Taliban\nImmediately after the 9/11 attacks, the United States National Security Council agreed that military action would probably have to be taken against Al-Qaeda and the Taliban However, Bush decided to issue an ultimatum to the Taliban first, [122]: 54  demanding that the Taliban hand over Osama bin Laden, \"close immediately every terrorist training camp, hand over every terrorist and their supporters, and give the United States full access to terrorist training camps for inspection.\" [123] The same day, religious scholars met in Kabul, deciding that bin Laden should be surrendered; however, Mullah Omar decided that \"turning over Osama would only be a disgrace for us and Islamic thought and belief would be a weakness\", and that the US would continue making demands after surrendering bin Laden, who he claimed was innocent [122]: 56  The Taliban refused the ultimatum, saying that Osama bin Laden was protected by the traditional Pashtun laws of hospitality [124] [125]\n\n\nHistory\nThe war contained two main factions: the Coalition, which included the US and its allies (eventually supporting the government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan), fighting against the Taliban, its allies, and its militias Complicating the fight were Taliban splinter groups and other, more radical religious groups such as al-Qaeda and later the Islamic State These radical groups sometimes fought for the Taliban, sometimes fought for their own goals, and sometimes fought against both the Taliban and the government.\n\n\nTactical overview\nThe war contained

Taliban, sometimes fought for their own goals, and sometimes fought against both the Taliban and the government.\n\n\n2001: Invasion and early operations\nThough the US officially invaded on 7 October 2001 by launching Operation Enduring Freedom, covert operations had begun several weeks earlier Fifteen days after the 9/11 attack, the US covertly inserted members of the CIA's Special Activities Division into Afghanistan, forming the Northern Afghanistan Liaison Team [136] They linked up with the Northern Alliance in the Panjshir Valley north of Kabul [137] In October, 12-man Special Forces teams began arriving in Afghanistan to work with the CIA and Northern Alliance [137] Within a few weeks the Northern Alliance, with assistance from the US ground and air forces, captured several key cities from the Taliban [138] [139] The Taliban retreated throughout the country, holding steady only in Kunduz Province, outmatched by US air support By November, the Taliban had lost control of most of the country [122]: 70–75 \n\n\n2002–2005: Taliban resurgence\nAfter initial success, the US lacked an obvious goal in Afghanistan beyond the counter-terrorism objectives of finding senior Taliban and Al-Qaeda leaders Nation-building was initially opposed by the Bush administration, but as the US stayed, it slowly crept into the rationale for staying In April 2002, Bush made a speech expressing a desire to rebuild Afghanistan The US also sought to instill democracy and women's rights as a moral matter The international community contributed to the development effort in Afghanistan, which focused on aid and creating institutions to run the country US reconstruction efforts also focused on improving education, health care, and community development The US also supported and funded the creation of an Afghan army in early 2002 However, the army was built slowly due to competing interests and a US belief that the Taliban were no longer a strong threat Some in the Bush administration preferred to use the Northern Alliance and warlords as the military instead of creating a new military The army became an afterthought and was poorly trained and equipped, which further enabled the Taliban [122]: 89–105 \n\n\nCoalition mistakes, Taliban start to re-organize\nAfter initial success, the US lacked an obvious goal in Afghanistan beyond the counter-terrorism objectives of finding

which further enabled the Taliban [122]: 89–105 \n\n\n2006–2007: Escalating war\n\nAs insurgent attacks in the country reportedly grew fourfold between 2002 and 2006, [168] by late 2007 Afghanistan was said to be in \"serious danger\" of falling into Taliban control despite the presence of 40,000 ISAF troops [169]\n\n2008-2009: NATO build-up, Pakistan skirmishes, and Karzai re-election\nOn 13 June 2008, Taliban fighters demonstrated their ongoing strength, liberating all prisoners in Kandahar jail The operation freed 1200 prisoners, 400 of whom were Taliban, causing a major embarrassment for NATO [193] By the end of 2008, the Taliban apparently had severed remaining ties with al-Qaeda [194] According to senior US military intelligence officials, perhaps fewer than 100 members of al-Qaeda remained in Afghanistan [195]\n\n\n2010–2011: Strategic agreements and death of Bin Laden\nDeployment of additional US troops continued in early 2010, with 9,000 of the planned 30,000 in place before the end of March and another 18,000 expected by June [232] The surge in troops supported a sixfold increase in Special Forces operations [233] The surge of American personnel that began in late 2009 ended by September 2012 [234] 700 airstrikes occurred in September 2010 alone versus 257 in all of 2009 [235]\n\n\n2012-2013: U.S. troop incidents, Obama-Karzai meetings\nBeginning in January 2012, incidents involving US troops [264] [265] [266] [267] [268] [269] occurred that were described by The Sydney Morning Herald as \"a series of damaging incidents and disclosures involving US troops in Afghanistan.\" [264] These incidents created fractures in the partnership between Afghanistan and ISAF, [270] raised the question whether discipline within US troops was breaking down, [271] undermined \"the image of foreign forces in a country where there is already deep resentment owing to civilian deaths and a perception among many Afghans that US troops lack respect for Afghan culture and people\" [272] and strained the relations between Afghanistan and the United States [265] [266] Besides an incident involving US troops who posed with body parts of dead insurgents and a video apparently showing a US helicopter crew singing \"bye-bye Miss American Pie\" before blasting a group of Afghan men with a Hellfire missile [272] [273] these \"high-profile US military incidents in Afghanistan\" [268] also included the 2012 Afghanistan Quran burning protests and the Panjwai shooting spree.\n\n2014–2015: Withdrawal and increase of insurgency\nThe UK and the US officially ended their combat operation in Afghanistan on 26 October 2014 The UK handed over its last base in Afghanistan, Camp Bastion, and the US handed over its last base, Camp Leatherneck, to Afghan forces [292] Around 500 UK troops remained in \"non-combat\" roles [293] [294] On 28 December, NATO officially ended combat operations in a ceremony held in Kabul [295] Continued operations by US forces within Afghanistan were under Operation Freedom's Sentinel; [296] and the new NATO mission was Operation Resolute Support [297]\n\n\n2016-2017: Collapse of peace talks, emergence of Islamic State\nIn January 2016, the US government sent a directive to the Pentagon which granted new legal authority for the US military to go on the offensive against Militants affiliated with the ISIL-KP, after the State Department announced the designation of ISIS in Afghanistan and Pakistan as a foreign terrorist organization The number of militants started with around 60 or 70, with most of them coming over the border with Pakistan but eventually [when?] ranged between 1,000 and 3,000 militants [343] They were mainly defectors from the Afghan and the Pakistani Taliban, and were generally confined to Nangarhar Province, and partially, Kunar province [343] [344]\n\n\n2018–2019: Peace overtures\nIn January 2018, the Taliban were openly active in 70% of the country (being in full control of 14 districts and have an active and open physical presence in a further 263) and the Islamic State was more active in the country than ever before Following recent attacks by the Taliban (including the Kabul ambulance bombing on 27 January) and Islamic State that killed scores of civilians, President Trump and Afghan officials decided to rule out any talks with the Taliban [379] However, on 27 February, following an increase in violence, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani proposed unconditional peace talks with the Taliban, offering them recognition as a legal political party and the release of the Taliban prisoners The offer was the most favorable to the Taliban since the war started It was preceded by months of national consensus building, which found that Afghans overwhelmingly supported a negotiated end to the war [380] [381] Two days earlier, the Taliban had called for talks with the US [382] On 27 March, a conference of 20 countries in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, backed the Afghan government's peace offer [383] The Taliban did not publicly respond to the offer [citation needed]\n\n\n2020: US-Taliban deal, beginning of US withdrawal\nOn 29 February, 2020, the United States and the Taliban signed a conditional peace deal in Doha, Qatar, [412] that called for a prisoner exchange within ten days and was supposed to lead to US troops withdrawal from Afghanistan within 14 months [84] [413] However, the Afghan government was not a party to the deal, and, in a press conference the next day, President Ghani criticized the deal for being \"signed behind closed doors.\" He said the Afghan government had \"made no commitment to free 5,000 Taliban prisoners\" and that such an action \"is not the United States' authority, but it is the authority of the government of Afghanistan.\" [414] [415] [85] [416]\n\n\n2021: End of US withdrawal, last Taliban offensive\nThe Taliban insurgency intensified considerably in 2021 coinciding with the withdrawal of United States and allied troops from Afghanistan [434] Since the US withdrawal, the number of casualties of women in the Afghanistan conflict rose by almost 40% in the first quarter of 2021 alone [435]\n\n\nImpact\nAccording to the Costs of War Project at Brown University, the war killed 46,319 Afghan civilians in Afghanistan However, the death toll is possibly higher due to unaccounted deaths by \"disease, loss of access to food, water, infrastructure, and/or other indirect consequences of the war.\" [89] A report titled Body Count put together by Physicians for Social Responsibility, Physicians for Global Survival and International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW) concluded that 106,000–170,000 civilians have been killed as a result of the fighting in Afghanistan at the hands of all parties to the conflict [457]\n\n\nCasualties\nAccording to the Costs of War Project at Brown University, the war killed 46,319 Afghan civilians in Afghanistan However, the death toll is possibly higher due to unaccounted deaths by \"disease, loss of access to food, water, infrastructure, and/or other indirect consequences of the war.\" [89] A report titled Body

civilians have been killed as a result of the fighting in Afghanistan at the hands of all parties to the conflict [457]\n\n\nRefugees\nMillions of Afghans have been internally displaced or become refugees as a result of decades of conflict in Afghanistan since 1979 From 2002 to 2012, more than 5.7 million former refugees returned to Afghanistan, increasing the country's population by 25% [469] [470] 2.6 million Afghans remained refugees in 2021 when the Taliban took over, [91] [471] while another 4 million were internally displaced [91] Following the Taliban takeover, over 122,000 people were airlifted abroad from Kabul airport, during the evacuation from Afghanistan, including Afghans, American citizens, and other foreign citizens [472]\n\n\nWar crimes\nWar crimes have been committed by both sides including civilian massacres, bombings of civilian targets, terrorism, use of torture and the murder of prisoners of war Additional common crimes include theft, arson, and destruction of property not warranted by military necessity.\n\n\nDrug trade\nIn 2000, Afghanistan accounted for an estimated 75% of the world's opium supply, [487] which was the Taliban's largest source of revenue through taxes on opium exports [488] Mullah Omar banned opium cultivation in 2001, [489] which observers said was an attempt to gain international recognition, raise opium prices and increase profit from the sale of large existing stockpiles [488] Opium production increased in the years following the October 2001 invasion, with Afghanistan producing 90% of the world's opium by 2005 [490] According to a 2018 SIGAR report, the US had spent $8.6 billion since 2002 to stop Afghanistan's drug trade A May 2021 SIGAR report estimated that the Taliban earned 60% of their revenue from the trade, while UN officials estimated more than $400 million was earned by the Taliban between 2018 and 2019, however other experts estimated that the Taliban earned at most $40 million annually [491]\n\n\nNATO's inability to stabilize Afghanistan\nObservers have argued that the mission in Afghanistan was hampered by a lack of agreement on objectives, a lack of resources, lack of coordination, too much focus on the central government at the expense of local and provincial governments, and too much focus on the country instead of the region [492]\n\n\nEnvironment and drug trade\nAccording to Cara Korte, climate change played a significant role in increasing instability in Afghanistan and strengthening the Taliban More than 60% of the Afghan population depend on agriculture and Afghanistan is the sixth most vulnerable country to climate change in the world according to the United Nations Environment Program and Afghanistan's National Environmental Protection Agency The Taliban used resentment over government inaction to climate change-induced drought and flooding to strengthen its support and Afghans were able to earn more money supporting the Taliban than from farming [493]\n\n\nEarly mistakes and the US's other war\nJournalist Jason Burke notes \"strategic mistakes by the US and allies in the immediate aftermath of the 2001 invasion\" as being a reason why the war went on for so long He also noted \"missed early opportunities\" to \"construct a stable political settlement.\" [495]\n\n\nDomestic corruption and politics\nIn 2009, Afghanistan was ranked as the world's second most-corrupt country [497] A lengthy report by SIGAR, and other findings, found that spiraling corruption in Afghanistan during the 2000s was not halted by the United States During this time, many elite figures in the country had effectively become kleptocrats, while ordinary Afghans were struggling [494]\n\n\nInfluence of non-NATO actors\nPakistan played a central role in the conflict A 2010 report published by the London School of Economics says that Pakistan's ISI has an \"official policy\" of support to the Taliban [502] \"Pakistan appears to be playing a double-game of astonishing magnitude\", the report states [502] Regarding the Afghan War documents leak, Der Spiegel wrote that \"the documents clearly show that the Pakistani intelligence agency Inter-Services Intelligence (usually known as the ISI) is the most important accomplice the Taliban has outside of Afghanistan.\" [503] Amrullah Saleh, former director of Afghanistan's intelligence service, stated, \"We talk about all these proxies  [Taliban, Haqqanis] but not the master of proxies, which is the Pakistan army The question is what does Pakistan's army want to achieve ...? They want to gain influence in the region.\" [504] Pakistan's role can be traced back to the Soviet war in which they funded the Mujahideen against the Soviets Pakistan's objective then as it is now is to ensure that Afghanistan has a regime friendly to their interests and will provide \"geopolitical depth in any future conflict with India.\" [505]\n\n\nAmerican public misleading\nIn December 2019 The Washington Post published 2,000 pages of government documents, mostly transcripts of interviews with more than 400 key figures involved in prosecuting the Afghanistan war According to the Post and The Guardian, the documents (dubbed the Afghanistan Papers) showed that US officials consistently and deliberately misled the American public about the unwinnable nature of the conflict, [510] and some commentators and foreign policy experts subsequently drew comparisons to the release of the Pentagon Papers [510] [511]\n\n\nForeign support for the Taliban\nThe Taliban's victory was facilitated in support from Pakistan Although Pakistan was a major US ally before and after the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, elements of the Pakistan government (including the military and intelligence services) have for decades maintained strong logistical and tactical ties with Taliban militants, and this support helped support the insurgency in Afghanistan [512] [513] For example, the Haqqani Network, a Taliban affiliate based on Pakistan, had strong support from Inter-Services Intelligence, the Pakistan intelligence agency [512] Taliban leaders found a safe haven in Pakistan, lived in the country, transacted business and earned funds there, and received medical treatment there [512] [513] Some elements of the Pakistani establishment sympathized with Taliban ideology, and many Pakistan officials considered the Taliban as an asset against India [512] [513] Bruce Riedel noted that \"The Pakistan Army believes Afghanistan provides strategic depth against India, which is their obsession.\" [513]\n\n\nPakistan\nThe Taliban's victory was facilitated in support from Pakistan Although Pakistan was a major US ally before and after the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, elements

Revolutionary Guard Commander Qassem Suleimani initially cooperated, secretly, with American officials against Al-Qaeda operatives and the Taliban, but that cooperation ended after the Axis of Evil Speech on January 29, 2002, which included calling Iran a major state sponsor of terror and threat to peace in the region Afterwards, Iranian forces became increasingly hostile to American forces in the region [142]\n\n\nReactions\nIn November 2001, the CNN reported widespread relief amongst Kabul's residents after the Taliban fled the city, with young men shaving off their beards and women taking off their burqas [515] Later that month the BBC's longtime Kabul correspondent Kate Clark reported that \"almost all women in Kabul are still choosing to veil\" but that many felt hopeful that the ousting of the Taliban would improve their safety and access to food [516]\n\n\nDomestic reactions\nIn November 2001, the CNN reported widespread relief amongst Kabul's residents after the Taliban

Kabul are still choosing to veil\" but that many felt hopeful that the ousting of the Taliban would improve their safety and access to food [516]\n\n\nInternational public opinion\nIn October 2001 when the invasion began, polls indicated that about 88% of Americans and about 65% of Britons backed military action [520] An Ipsos-Reid poll conducted between November and December 2001 showed that majorities in Canada (66%), France (60%), Germany (60%), Italy (58%), and the UK (65%) approved of US airstrikes while majorities in Argentina (77%), China (52%), South Korea (50%), Spain (52%), and Turkey (70%) opposed them [521]\n\n\nProtests, demonstrations and rallies\nThe war was the subject of large protests around the world, starting with the large-scale demonstrations in the days leading up to the invasion and every year since Many protesters considered the bombing and invasion of Afghanistan to be unjustified aggression [524] Dozens of organizations held a national march for peace in Washington, D.C., on 20 March 2010 [525]\n\n\nAftermath\nOn 7 September 2021, an interim government headed by Mohammad Hassan Akhund as Prime Minister was declared by the Taliban [526]\n\n\nFormation of the Taliban government and international recognition\nOn 7 September 2021, an interim government headed by Mohammad Hassan Akhund as Prime Minister was declared by the Taliban [526]\n\n\nRepublican insurgency\nOn 17 August 2021, Vice President Saleh, citing provisions of the Constitution of Afghanistan, declared himself President of Afghanistan from a base of operations in the Panjshir Valley, which had not been taken by Taliban forces, and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban from there [527] His claim to the presidency was endorsed by Ahmad Massoud and Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Minister of Defence Bismillah Khan Mohammadi [527] By 6 September the Taliban had regained control over most of the valley, but armed resistance continued in the upper valleys Clashes in the valley mostly ceased by mid-September [528] The leaders of the resistance, Saleh and Massoud reportedly fled to neighboring Tajikistan in late September [529] However, fighting between Taliban and pro-republican forces continued in other provinces Several regions had become the site of a guerrilla campaign by early 2022 [530] The NRF launched an offensive in May 2022, reportedly retaking territory in Panjshir [531] Other pro-republican rebel groups also emerged, including the \"Ahmad Khan Samangani Front\", [532] \"Afghan Freedom Front\", [533] \"Afghanistan Islamic National & Liberation Movement\", and several smaller factions [534]\n\n\nIslamic State activity\nFollowing the 2021 Kabul airport attack conducted by the terrorist group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province (a branch of the ISIL), the US said it could work with the Taliban to fight against the ISIS terrorists as part of the International military intervention against ISIL [535]\n\n\nAbandonment of Afghan allies\nAs many as 150,000 Afghans who assisted the United States remained in Afghanistan, including individuals who worked closely with US military forces [536] Hundreds of former Afghan special forces who fought alongside British troops in Afghanistan have been barred from resettling in the UK [537] [538] One former UK Special Forces officer told the BBC that \"At a time when certain actions by UK Special Forces are under investigation by a public inquiry, their headquarters also had the power to prevent former Afghan Special Forces colleagues and potential witnesses to these actions from getting safely to the UK.\" [539]\n\n\nHumanitarian crisis\nFollowing the Taliban takeover, western nations suspended humanitarian aid and the World Bank and International Monetary Fund also halted payments to Afghanistan [540] [541] The Biden administration froze about $9 billion in assets belonging to the Afghan central banks, blocking the Taliban from accessing billions of dollars held in US bank accounts [542] In October 2021, the UN stated that more than half of Afghanistan's 39 million people faced an acute food shortage [543] On 11 November 2021, the Human Rights Watch reported that Afghanistan is facing widespread famine due to collapsed economy and broken banking system [541] World leaders pledged $1.2 billion in humanitarian aid to Afghanistan [542] On 22 December 2021, The United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a US-proposed resolution to help humanitarian aid reach desperate Afghans, while seeking to keep funds out of Taliban hands [544]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "War in Afghanistan (2001-2021)\n\nThe War in

performed by coalition forces, a 2015 to 2021 (the Resolute Support Mission), when the Afghan armed forces did most of the fighting against the Taliban [citation needed] The war was named Operation

[109] According to the United Nations (UN), the Taliban, while trying to consolidate control over northern and western Afghanistan, committed systematic massacres against civilians UN officials stated that there had been \"15 massacres\" between 1996 and 2001, many of them targeting Shias and Hazaras [110] [111]\n\n\nRise of the Taliban\nThe Taliban emerged from religious students known as the

Arabia, seized Kabul and founded the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan [108] The Taliban imposed their fundamentalist Deobandi interpretation of Islam in areas under their control, issuing edicts forbidding women to work outside the home, attend school or to leave their homes unless accompanied by a male relative [109] According to the United Nations (UN), the Taliban, while trying to consolidate control over northern and western Afghanistan, committed systematic massacres against civilians UN officials stated that there had been \"15 massacres\" between 1996 and 2001, many of them targeting Shias and Hazaras [110] [111]\n\n\nAl-Qaeda\nThe 9/11 Commission in the US found that under the Taliban, Al-Qaeda was able to use Afghanistan as a place to train and teach fighters, import weapons, coordinate with other jihadists, and plot terrorist actions [116] While Al-Qaeda maintained its own camps in Afghanistan, it also supported training camps of other organizations An estimated 10,000 to 20,000 men passed through these facilities before 9/11, most of whom were sent to fight for the Taliban against the United Front A smaller number were inducted into Al-Qaeda [117]\n\n\nSeptember 11 attacks\nOn the morning of Tuesday, September 11, 2001, a total of 19 men affiliated with Al-Qaeda carried out four coordinated attacks in the United States Four commercial passenger jet airliners were hijacked [119] [120] The hijackers intentionally crashed two of the airliners into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, killing everyone on board and more than 2,000 people in the buildings Both buildings collapsed within two hours from damage related to the crashes, destroying and damaging nearby buildings The hijackers crashed a third airliner into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C The fourth plane crashed into a field near Shanksville, in rural Pennsylvania, after some of its passengers and flight crew attempted to retake control of the plane, which the hijackers had redirected toward Washington, D.C., to target the White House, or the US Capitol No one aboard the flights survived The death toll among responders including firefighters and police was 836 as of 2009 [121] Total deaths were 2,996, including the 19 hijackers [121]\n\n\nUS ultimatum to the Taliban\nImmediately after the 9/11 attacks, the United States National Security Council agreed that military action would probably have to be taken against Al-Qaeda and the Taliban However, Bush decided to issue an ultimatum to the Taliban first, [122]: 54  demanding that the Taliban hand over Osama bin Laden, \"close immediately every terrorist training camp, hand over every terrorist and their supporters, and give the United States full access to terrorist training camps for inspection.\" [123] The same day, religious scholars met in Kabul, deciding that bin Laden should be surrendered; however, Mullah Omar decided that \"turning over Osama would only be a disgrace for us and Islamic thought and belief would be a weakness\", and that the US would continue making demands after surrendering bin Laden, who he claimed was innocent [122]: 56  The Taliban refused the ultimatum, saying that Osama bin Laden was protected by the traditional Pashtun laws of hospitality [124] [125]\n\n\nHistory\nThe war contained two main factions: the Coalition, which included the US and its allies (eventually supporting the government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan), fighting against the Taliban, its allies, and its militias Complicating the fight were Taliban splinter groups and other, more radical religious groups such as al-Qaeda and later the Islamic State These radical groups sometimes fought for the Taliban, sometimes fought for their own goals, and sometimes fought against both the Taliban and the government.\n\n\nTactical overview\nThe war contained two main factions: the Coalition, which included the US and its allies (eventually supporting the government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan), fighting against the Taliban, its allies, and its militias Complicating the fight were Taliban splinter groups and other, more radical religious groups such as al-Qaeda and later the Islamic State These radical groups sometimes fought for the Taliban, sometimes fought for their own goals, and sometimes fought against both the Taliban and the government.\n\n\n2001: Invasion and early operations\nThough the US officially invaded on 7 October 2001 by launching Operation Enduring Freedom, covert operations had begun several weeks earlier Fifteen days after the 9/11 attack, the US covertly inserted members of the CIA's Special Activities Division into Afghanistan, forming the Northern Afghanistan Liaison Team [136] They linked up with the Northern Alliance in the Panjshir Valley north of Kabul [137] In October, 12-man Special Forces teams began arriving in Afghanistan to work with the CIA and Northern Alliance [137] Within a few weeks the Northern Alliance, with assistance from the US ground and air forces, captured several key cities from the Taliban [138] [139] The Taliban retreated throughout the country, holding steady only in Kunduz Province, outmatched by US air support By November, the Taliban had lost control of most of the country [122]: 70–75 \n\n\n2002–2005: Taliban resurgence\nAfter initial success, the US lacked an obvious goal in Afghanistan beyond the counter-terrorism objectives of finding senior Taliban and Al-Qaeda leaders Nation-building was initially opposed by the Bush administration, but as the US stayed, it slowly crept into the rationale for staying In April 2002, Bush made a speech expressing a desire to rebuild Afghanistan The US also sought to instill democracy and women's rights as a moral matter The international community contributed to the development effort in Afghanistan, which focused on aid and creating institutions to run the country US reconstruction efforts also focused on improving education, health care, and community development The US also supported and funded the creation of an Afghan army in early 2002 However, the army was built slowly due to competing interests and a US belief that the Taliban were no longer a strong threat Some in the Bush administration preferred to use the Northern Alliance and warlords as the military instead of creating a new military The army became an afterthought and was poorly trained and equipped, which further enabled the Taliban [122]: 89–105 \n\n\nCoalition mistakes, Taliban start to re-organize\nAfter initial success, the US lacked an obvious goal in Afghanistan beyond the counter-terrorism objectives of finding senior Taliban and Al-Qaeda leaders

the Northern Alliance and warlords as the military instead of creating a new military The army became an afterthought and was poorly trained and equipped, which further enabled the Taliban [122]: 89–105 \n\n\n2006–2007: Escalating war\n\nAs insurgent attacks in the country reportedly grew fourfold between 2002 and 2006, [168] by late 2007 Afghanistan was said to be in \"serious danger\" of falling into Taliban control despite the presence of 40,000 ISAF troops [169]\n\n2008-2009: NATO build-up, Pakistan skirmishes, and Karzai re-election\nOn 13 June 2008, Taliban fighters demonstrated their ongoing strength, liberating all prisoners in Kandahar jail The operation freed 1200 prisoners, 400 of whom were Taliban, causing a major embarrassment for NATO [193] By the end of 2008, the Taliban apparently had severed remaining ties with al-Qaeda [194] According to senior US military intelligence officials, perhaps fewer than 100 members of al-Qaeda remained in Afghanistan [195]\n\n\n2010–2011: Strategic agreements and death of Bin Laden\nDeployment of additional US troops continued in early 2010, with 9,000 of the planned 30,000 in place before the end of March and another 18,000 expected by June [232] The surge in troops supported a sixfold increase in Special Forces operations [233] The surge of American personnel that began in late 2009 ended by September 2012 [234] 700 airstrikes occurred in September 2010 alone versus 257 in all of 2009 [235]\n\n\n2012-2013: U.S. troop incidents, Obama-Karzai meetings\nBeginning in January 2012, incidents involving US troops [264] [265] [266] [267] [268] [269] occurred that were described by The Sydney Morning Herald as \"a series of damaging incidents and disclosures involving US troops in Afghanistan.\" [264] These incidents created fractures in the partnership between Afghanistan and ISAF, [270] raised the question whether discipline within US troops was breaking down, [271] undermined \"the image of foreign forces in a country where there is already deep resentment owing to civilian deaths and a perception among many Afghans that US troops lack respect for Afghan culture and people\" [272] and strained the relations between Afghanistan and the United States [265] [266] Besides an incident involving US troops who posed with body parts of dead insurgents and a video apparently showing a US helicopter crew singing \"bye-bye Miss American Pie\" before blasting a group of Afghan men with a Hellfire missile [272] [273] these \"high-profile US military incidents in Afghanistan\" [268] also included the 2012 Afghanistan Quran burning protests and the Panjwai shooting spree.\n\n2014–2015: Withdrawal and increase of insurgency\nThe UK and the US officially ended their combat operation in Afghanistan on 26 October 2014 The UK handed over its last base in Afghanistan, Camp Bastion, and the US handed over its last base, Camp Leatherneck, to Afghan forces [292] Around 500 UK troops remained in \"non-combat\" roles [293] [294] On 28 December, NATO officially ended combat operations in a ceremony held in Kabul [295] Continued operations by US forces within Afghanistan were under Operation Freedom's Sentinel; [296] and the new NATO mission was Operation Resolute Support [297]\n\n\n2016-2017: Collapse of peace talks, emergence of Islamic State\nIn January 2016, the US government sent a directive to the Pentagon which granted new legal authority for the US military to go on the offensive against Militants affiliated with the ISIL-KP, after the State Department announced the designation of ISIS in Afghanistan and Pakistan as a foreign terrorist organization The number of militants started with around 60 or 70, with most of them coming over the border with Pakistan but eventually [when?] ranged between 1,000 and 3,000 militants [343] They were mainly defectors from the Afghan and the Pakistani Taliban, and were generally confined to Nangarhar Province, and partially, Kunar province [343] [344]\n\n\n2018–2019: Peace overtures\nIn January 2018, the Taliban were openly active in 70% of the country (being in full control of 14 districts and have an active and open physical presence in a further 263) and the Islamic State was more active in the country than ever before Following recent attacks by the Taliban (including the Kabul ambulance bombing on 27 January) and Islamic State that killed scores of civilians, President Trump and Afghan officials decided to rule out any talks with the Taliban [379] However, on 27 February, following an increase in violence, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani proposed unconditional peace talks with the Taliban, offering them recognition as a legal political party and the release of the Taliban prisoners The offer was the most favorable to the Taliban since the war started It was preceded by months of national consensus building, which found that Afghans overwhelmingly supported a negotiated end to the war [380] [381] Two days earlier, the Taliban had called for talks with the US [382] On 27 March, a conference of 20 countries in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, backed the Afghan government's peace offer [383] The Taliban did not publicly respond to the offer [citation needed]\n\n\n2020: US-Taliban deal, beginning of US withdrawal\nOn 29 February, 2020, the United States and the Taliban signed a conditional peace deal in Doha, Qatar, [412] that called for a prisoner exchange within ten days and was supposed to lead to US troops withdrawal from Afghanistan within 14 months [84] [413] However, the Afghan government was not a party to the deal, and, in a press conference the next day, President Ghani criticized the deal for being \"signed behind closed doors.\" He said the Afghan government had \"made no commitment to free 5,000 Taliban prisoners\" and that such an action \"is not the United States' authority, but it is the authority of the government of Afghanistan.\" [414] [415] [85] [416]\n\n\n2021: End of US withdrawal, last Taliban offensive\nThe Taliban insurgency intensified considerably in 2021 coinciding with the withdrawal of United States and allied troops from Afghanistan [434] Since the US withdrawal, the number of casualties of women in the Afghanistan conflict rose by almost 40% in the first quarter of 2021 alone [435]\n\n\nImpact\nAccording to the Costs of War Project at Brown University, the war killed 46,319 Afghan civilians in Afghanistan However, the death toll is possibly higher due to unaccounted deaths by \"disease, loss of access to food, water, infrastructure, and/or other indirect consequences of the war.\" [89] A report titled Body Count put together by Physicians for Social Responsibility, Physicians for Global Survival and International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW) concluded that 106,000–170,000 civilians have been killed as a result of the fighting in Afghanistan at the hands of all parties to the conflict [457]\n\n\nCasualties\nAccording to the Costs of War Project at Brown University, the war killed 46,319 Afghan civilians in Afghanistan However, the death toll is possibly higher due to unaccounted deaths by \"disease, loss of access to food, water, infrastructure, and/or other indirect consequences of the war.\" [89] A report titled Body Count put together by Physicians for Social Responsibility, Physicians for Global Survival and International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW) concluded that 106,000–170,000 civilians have been killed as a result of the fighting in Afghanistan at the hands of all parties to the conflict [457]\n\n\nRefugees\nMillions of Afghans have been internally displaced or become refugees as a result of decades of conflict in Afghanistan since 1979 From 2002 to 2012, more than 5.7 million former refugees returned to Afghanistan, increasing the country's population by 25% [469] [470] 2.6 million Afghans remained refugees in 2021 when the Taliban took over, [91] [471] while another 4 million were internally displaced [91] Following the Taliban takeover, over 122,000 people were airlifted abroad from Kabul airport, during the evacuation from Afghanistan, including Afghans, American citizens, and other foreign citizens [472]\n\n\nWar crimes\nWar crimes have been committed by both sides including civilian massacres, bombings of civilian targets, terrorism, use of torture and the murder of prisoners of war Additional common crimes include theft, arson, and destruction of property not warranted by military necessity.\n\n\nDrug trade\nIn 2000, Afghanistan accounted for an estimated 75% of the world's opium supply, [487] which was the Taliban's largest source of revenue through taxes on opium exports [488] Mullah Omar banned opium cultivation in 2001, [489] which observers said was an attempt to gain international recognition, raise opium prices and increase profit from the sale of large existing stockpiles [488] Opium production increased in the years following the October 2001 invasion, with Afghanistan producing 90% of the world's opium by 2005 [490] According to a 2018 SIGAR report, the US had spent $8.6 billion since 2002 to stop Afghanistan's drug trade A May 2021 SIGAR report estimated that the Taliban earned 60% of their revenue from the trade, while UN officials estimated more than $400 million was earned by the Taliban between 2018 and 2019, however other experts estimated that the Taliban earned at most $40 million annually [491]\n\n\nNATO's inability to stabilize Afghanistan\nObservers have argued that the mission in Afghanistan was hampered by a lack of agreement on objectives, a lack of resources, lack of coordination, too much focus on the central government at the expense of local and provincial governments, and too much focus on the country instead of the region [492]\n\n\nEnvironment and drug trade\nAccording to Cara Korte, climate change played a significant role in increasing instability in Afghanistan and strengthening the Taliban More than 60% of the Afghan population depend on agriculture and Afghanistan is the sixth most vulnerable country to climate change in the world according to the United Nations Environment Program and Afghanistan's National Environmental Protection Agency The Taliban used resentment over government inaction to climate change-induced drought and flooding to strengthen its support and Afghans were able to earn more money supporting the Taliban than from farming [493]\n\n\nEarly mistakes and the US's other war\nJournalist Jason Burke notes \"strategic mistakes by the US and allies in the immediate aftermath of the 2001 invasion\" as being a reason why the war went on for so long He also noted \"missed early opportunities\" to \"construct a stable political settlement.\" [495]\n\n\nDomestic corruption and politics\nIn 2009, Afghanistan was ranked as the world's second most-corrupt country [497] A lengthy report by SIGAR, and other findings, found that spiraling corruption in Afghanistan during the 2000s was not halted by the United States During this time, many elite figures in the country had effectively become kleptocrats, while ordinary Afghans were struggling [494]\n\n\nInfluence of non-NATO actors\nPakistan played a central role in the conflict A 2010 report published by the London School of Economics says that Pakistan's ISI has an \"official policy\" of support to the Taliban [502] \"Pakistan appears to be playing a double-game of astonishing magnitude\", the report states [502] Regarding the Afghan War documents leak, Der Spiegel wrote that \"the documents clearly show that the Pakistani intelligence agency Inter-Services Intelligence (usually known as the ISI) is the most important accomplice the Taliban has outside of Afghanistan.\" [503] Amrullah Saleh, former director of Afghanistan's intelligence service, stated, \"We talk about all these proxies  [Taliban, Haqqanis] but not the master of proxies, which is the Pakistan army The question is what does Pakistan's army want to achieve ...? They want to gain influence in the region.\" [504] Pakistan's role can be traced back to the Soviet war in which they funded the Mujahideen against the Soviets Pakistan's objective then as it is now is to ensure that Afghanistan has a regime friendly to their interests and will provide \"geopolitical depth in any future conflict with India.\" [505]\n\n\nAmerican public misleading\nIn December 2019 The Washington Post published 2,000 pages of government documents, mostly transcripts of interviews with more than 400 key figures involved in prosecuting the Afghanistan war According to the Post and The Guardian, the documents (dubbed the Afghanistan Papers) showed that US officials consistently and deliberately misled the American public about the unwinnable nature of the conflict, [510] and some commentators and foreign policy experts subsequently drew comparisons to the release of the Pentagon Papers [510] [511]\n\n\nForeign support for the Taliban\nThe Taliban's victory was facilitated in support from Pakistan Although Pakistan was a major US ally before and after the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, elements of the Pakistan government (including the military and intelligence services) have for decades maintained strong logistical and tactical ties with Taliban militants, and this support helped support the insurgency in Afghanistan [512] [513] For example, the Haqqani Network, a Taliban affiliate based on Pakistan, had strong support from Inter-Services Intelligence, the Pakistan intelligence agency [512] Taliban leaders found a safe haven in Pakistan, lived in the country, transacted business and earned funds there, and received medical treatment there [512] [513] Some elements of the Pakistani establishment sympathized with Taliban ideology, and many Pakistan officials considered the Taliban as an asset against India [512] [513] Bruce Riedel noted that \"The Pakistan Army believes Afghanistan provides strategic depth against India, which is their obsession.\" [513]\n\n\nPakistan\nThe Taliban's victory was facilitated in support from Pakistan Although Pakistan was a major US ally before and after the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, elements

Afghanistan provides strategic depth against India, which is their obsession.\" [513]\n\n\nRussia and Iran\nIn the initial aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, Iranian forces, led by Revolutionary Guard Commander Qassem Suleimani initially cooperated, secretly, with American officials against Al-Qaeda operatives and the Taliban, but that cooperation ended after the Axis of Evil Speech on January 29, 2002, which included calling Iran a major state sponsor of terror and threat to peace in the region Afterwards, Iranian forces became increasingly hostile to American forces in the region [142]\n\n\nReactions\nIn November 2001, the CNN reported widespread relief amongst Kabul's residents after the Taliban fled the city, with young men shaving off their beards and women taking off their burqas [515] Later that month the BBC's longtime Kabul correspondent Kate Clark reported that \"almost all women in Kabul are still choosing to veil\" but that many felt hopeful that the ousting of the Taliban would improve their safety and access to food [516]\n\n\nDomestic reactions\nIn November 2001, the CNN reported widespread relief amongst Kabul's residents after the Taliban

Kabul are still choosing to veil\" but that many felt hopeful that the ousting of the Taliban would improve their safety and access to food [516]\n\n\nInternational public opinion\nIn October 2001 when the invasion began, polls indicated that about 88% of Americans and about 65% of Britons backed military action [520] An Ipsos-Reid poll conducted between November and December 2001 showed that majorities in Canada (66%), France (60%), Germany (60%), Italy (58%), and the UK (65%) approved of US airstrikes while majorities in Argentina (77%), China (52%), South Korea (50%), Spain (52%), and Turkey (70%) opposed them [521]\n\n\nProtests, demonstrations and rallies\nThe war was the subject of large protests around the world, starting with the large-scale demonstrations in the days leading up to the invasion and every year since Many protesters considered the bombing and invasion of Afghanistan to be unjustified aggression [524] Dozens of organizations held a national march for peace in Washington, D.C., on 20 March 2010 [525]\n\n\nAftermath\nOn 7 September 2021, an interim government headed by Mohammad Hassan Akhund as Prime Minister was declared by the Taliban [526]\n\n\nFormation of the Taliban government and international recognition\nOn 7 September 2021, an interim government headed by Mohammad Hassan Akhund as Prime Minister was declared by the Taliban [526]\n\n\nRepublican insurgency\nOn 17 August 2021, Vice President Saleh, citing provisions of the Constitution of Afghanistan, declared himself President of Afghanistan from a base of operations in the Panjshir Valley, which had not been taken by Taliban forces, and vowed to continue military operations against the Taliban from there [527] His claim to the presidency was endorsed by Ahmad Massoud and Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Minister of Defence Bismillah Khan Mohammadi [527] By 6 September the Taliban had regained control over most of the valley, but armed resistance continued in the upper valleys Clashes in the valley mostly ceased by mid-September [528] The leaders of the resistance, Saleh and Massoud reportedly fled to neighboring Tajikistan in late September [529] However, fighting between Taliban and pro-republican forces continued in other provinces Several regions had become the site of a guerrilla campaign by early 2022 [530] The NRF launched an offensive in May 2022, reportedly retaking territory in Panjshir [531] Other pro-republican rebel groups also emerged, including the \"Ahmad Khan Samangani Front\", [532] \"Afghan Freedom Front\", [533] \"Afghanistan Islamic National & Liberation Movement\", and several smaller factions [534]\n\n\nIslamic State activity\nFollowing the 2021 Kabul airport attack conducted by the terrorist group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province (a branch of the ISIL), the US said it could work with the Taliban to fight against the ISIS terrorists as part of the International military intervention against ISIL [535]\n\n\nAbandonment of Afghan allies\nAs many as 150,000 Afghans who assisted the United States remained in Afghanistan, including individuals who worked closely with US military forces [536] Hundreds of former Afghan special forces who fought alongside British troops in Afghanistan have been barred from resettling in the UK [537] [538] One former UK Special Forces officer told the BBC that \"At a time when certain actions by UK Special Forces are under investigation by a public inquiry, their headquarters also had the power to prevent former Afghan Special Forces colleagues and potential witnesses to these actions from getting safely to the UK.\" [539]\n\n\nHumanitarian crisis\nFollowing the Taliban takeover, western nations suspended humanitarian aid and the World Bank and International Monetary Fund also halted payments to Afghanistan [540] [541] The Biden administration froze about $9 billion in assets belonging to the Afghan central banks, blocking the Taliban from accessing billions of dollars held in US bank accounts [542] In October 2021, the UN stated that more than half of Afghanistan's 39 million people faced an acute food shortage [543] On 11 November 2021, the Human Rights Watch reported that Afghanistan is facing widespread famine due to collapsed economy and broken banking system [541] World leaders pledged $1.2 billion in humanitarian aid to Afghanistan [542] On 22 December 2021, The United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a US-proposed resolution to help humanitarian aid reach desperate Afghans, while seeking to keep funds out of Taliban hands [544]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "SpaceX_Starship_development", "content": "\nDescription\nWhen stacked and fully fueled, Starship has a mass of approximately 5,000 t (11,000,000 lb), [b] a diameter of 9 m (30 ft) [12] and a height of 121.3 m (398 ft) [13] The rocket has been designed with the goal of being fully reusable to reduce launch costs; [14] it consists of the Super Heavy first-stage booster and the Starship spacecraft [15] which are powered by Raptor and Raptor Vacuum engines [16] The bodies of both rocket stages are made from stainless steel [17] and are manufactured by stacking and welding stainless steel cylinders [18] These cylinders have a height of 1.8 m (5 ft 11 in), a thickness of 4 mm (0.16 in) and a mass of 1,600 kg (3,500 lb) each [18] Domes inside the spacecraft separate the methane and oxygen tanks [18] SpaceX has stated that Starship, in its \"baseline reuseable design\", will have a payload capacity of 100–150 t (220,000–331,000 lb) to low earth orbit and 27 t (60,000 lb) to geostationary transfer orbit [19] [20]\n\n\nSuper Heavy booster\nSuper Heavy is 71 m (233 ft) tall, 9 m (30 ft) wide, [12] and is composed of four general sections: the engines, the fuel tank, the oxygen tank, and the interstage [3] Elon Musk stated in 2021 that the final design will have a dry mass between 160 t (350,000 lb) and 200 t (440,000 lb), with the tanks weighing 80 t (180,000 lb) and the interstage 20 t (44,000 lb) [3]\n\n\nTanks\nThe propellant tanks on Super Heavy are separated by a common bulkhead, similar to the ones used on the S-II and S-IVB stages on the Saturn V rocket [21] [22] After Starship's Second Flight Test, the common dome's design was changed to a more elliptical dome, [23] which has changed the propellant capacity of both tanks by an unknown, but likely negligible, amount [23] Both tanks are heavily reinforced, with roughly 74 stringers attached to the interior walls of the tanks [24] The booster's tanks hold 3,400 t (7,500,000 lb) of propellant, [25] consisting of 2,700 t (6,000,000 lb) of liquid oxygen and 700 t (1,500,000 lb) of liquid methane [c]\n\n\nPropulsion\nSuper Heavy is powered by thirty-three Raptor engines, which are housed within a dedicated shielding compartment [34] This compartment is not present before engine installation, thus, boosters are roughly three meters shorter before engine installation [35] The outer twenty engines, arranged in a single ring, are in a fixed position [34] In order to save weight these engines are started using ground support equipment on the launch mount and cannot be reignited for subsequent burns [36] The inner thirteen engines are attached to an adapter, which rests directly against the thrust puck/aft dome assembly [34] These engines are equipped with gimbal actuators, and are capable of reigniting for the boostback and landing burns [37] After Starship's first flight test, this gimbaling system was switched from a hydraulic system to an electric one, enabling the removal of the hydraulic power units [38] This change was made to the upper stage after the second flight test During the ascent burn and boostback burns, the engines draw propellant from the main tanks, with the liquid oxygen being drawn from a dedicated header tank during the landing burn [29] Like the thrust vector control system, the engine shielding, which isolates individual engines in the event of a failure, was upgraded after Starship's first flight test, alongside the fire suppression system [38] This system uses CO2 tanks to purge the individual engine compartments during flight, as well as a nitrogen purge while on the launch pad [39] The aft bay has eighteen vents visible on the outside of the booster, which are believed to be connected to the outer twenty engines, [39] while the center engines vent directly below the launch pad [39]\n\n\nInterstage\n\nThe interstage is also equipped with four electrically actuated grid fins made out of stainless steel, each with a mass of 3 t (6,600 lb) [49] These grid fins are paired together, with the fins in each pair being sixty degrees apart from each other, differing from the Falcon 9 booster, which has titanium grid fins mounted ninety degrees from each other [50] [51] This is done to improve control in the pitch axis [51] Additionally, these fins remain extended during ascent in order to save weight [3] The interstage also has protruding hardpoints, located between grid fins, allowing the booster to be lifted or caught by the launch tower [52] The ability to lift a booster from these hardpoints was proven on August 23, 2022, when Booster 7 was lifted onto OLM A [53] The first catch of a booster occurred on October 13, 2024, using Booster 12 [54]\n\nStarship spacecraft\n\nThe current Block 1 of the Starship spacecraft is 50.3 m (165 ft) tall, 9 m (30 ft) in diameter, and has 6 Raptor engines, 3 of which are optimized for use in outer space [12] [60] The future Block 3 of the Starship spacecraft is planned to have an additional 3 Raptor Vacuum engines for increased payload capacity Starship Block 1's payload bay, measuring 17 m (56 ft) tall by 8 m (26 ft) in diameter, is the largest of any active or planned launch vehicle; its internal volume of 1,000 m3 (35,000 cu ft) is slightly larger than the International Space Station's pressurized volume [61] SpaceX will also provide a 22 m (72 ft) tall payload bay configuration for even larger payloads [19]\n\nHeat shield\nStarship's heat shield is composed of eighteen thousand [68] [69] hexagonal black tiles that can withstand temperatures of 1,400 °C (2,600 °F) [70] [71] It is designed to protect the vehicle during atmospheric entry and to be used multiple times with minimal maintenance between flights [72] The silica-based tiles [73] are attached to Starship with pins [71] and have small gaps in between to allow for heat expansion [3] After IFT-4, SpaceX added a secondary ablative layer under the primary heat shield [74] The total mass of the heat shield and ablative layer is 10.5 t (23,000 lb) [75]\n\n\nVariants\nFor satellite launch, Starship is planned to have a large cargo door that opens to release payloads, similar to NASA's Space Shuttle, and close upon reentry instead of a jettisonable nosecone fairing Instead of a cleanroom, payloads are integrated directly into Starship's payload bay, which requires purging the payload bay with temperature-controlled ISO class 8 clean air [19] To deploy Starlink satellites, the cargo door is to be replaced with a slot and dispenser rack, whose mechanism has been compared to a Pez candy dispenser [76]\n\n\nRaptor engine\nRaptor is a family of rocket engines developed by SpaceX for use in Starship and Super Heavy vehicles It burns liquid oxygen and methane in an efficient and complex full-flow staged combustion power cycle The Raptor engine uses methane as fuel rather than kerosene because methane gives higher performance and prevents the build-up of deposits in the engine from coking [87] [88] Methane can also be produced from carbon dioxide and water using the Sabatier reaction [89] The engines are designed to be reused many times with little maintenance [90]\n\n\nVersions\nOn April 4, 2024, Elon Musk provided an update on Starship at Starbase, where two new versions of Starship were announced, Block 2 and Block 3 [93] [94]\n\n\nBlock 1\nAs of October 13, 2024, Block 1 has been used for all 5 Integrated Flight Tests [95] [96]\n\n\nBlock 2\nAs of April 2024, exact specifications are not known for the Block 2 vehicle; however, the Block 2 ships will feature a thinner forward flap design, a 25% increase in propellant capacity, integrated vented interstage, and an increase in thrust [97] [98] The vehicle will be a total of 3.1 m (10 ft) taller than the previous Block 1 vehicle, and is planned to have a payload capacity of at least 100 tons to orbit when reused [97] Additionally, the engine type will switch to Raptor 3, which removes the need for secondary engine shielding [99] The capacity to manufacture Block 2 became possible as a large portion of the Starfactory was commissioned in 2024 [7]\n\n\nBlock 3\nAs of June 2024, the Block 3 final configuration is unknown The most recent configuration, as described in regulatory filings submitted to the FAA, has a height of 150 m (490 ft) [45] The Starship second stage will feature 9 Raptor engines, while the Super Heavy booster will have up to 35 [45] It is planned to have a payload capacity of at least 200 tons to orbit when reused [100]\n\n\nPlanned launch and landing profile\nPayloads are planned to be integrated into Starship at a separate facility and then rolled out to the launch site [101] Super Heavy and Starship are then to be stacked onto their launch mount and loaded with fuel via the ship quick disconnect (SQD) arm and booster quick disconnect (BQD) [52] The SQD and BQD retract, all thirty-three engines of Super Heavy ignite, and the rocket lifts off [52]\n\n\nDevelopment\nIn November 2005, [116] before SpaceX had launched its first rocket the Falcon 1, [117] CEO Elon Musk first mentioned a high-capacity rocket concept able to launch 100 t (220,000 lb) to low Earth orbit, dubbed the BFR [116] Later in 2012, Elon Musk first publicly announced plans to develop a rocket surpassing the capabilities of Space X's existing Falcon 9 [118] SpaceX called it the Mars Colonial Transporter, as the rocket was to transport humans to Mars and back [119] In 2016, the descriptor was changed to Interplanetary Transport System, as the rocket was planned to travel beyond Mars as well [120] The conceptual design called for a carbon fiber structure, [121] a mass in excess of 10,000 t (22,000,000 lb) when fully fueled, a payload of 300 t (660,000 lb) to low Earth orbit while being fully reusable [121] By 2017, the concept was again re-dubbed the BFR [122]\n\n\nEarly design concepts (2012–2019)\nIn November 2005, [116] before SpaceX had launched its first rocket the Falcon 1, [117] CEO Elon Musk first mentioned a high-capacity rocket concept able to launch 100 t (220,000 lb) to low Earth orbit, dubbed the BFR [116] Later

the concept was again re-dubbed the BFR [122]\n\n\nLow-altitude flight tests (2019–2021)\nThe first tests started with the construction of the first prototype in 2018, Starhopper, which performed several static fires and two successful low-altitude flights in 2019 [136] SpaceX began constructing the first full-size Starship MK1 and Mk2 upper-stage prototypes before 2019, at the SpaceX facilities in Boca Chica, Texas, and Cocoa, Florida, respectively [137] Neither prototype flew: Mk1 was destroyed in November 2019 during a pressure stress test and Mk2's Florida facility was deconstructed throughout 2020 [138] [73]\n\n\nStarhopper to SN6\nThe first tests started with the construction of the first prototype in 2018, Starhopper, which performed several static fires and two successful low-altitude flights in 2019 [136] SpaceX began constructing the first full-size Starship MK1 and Mk2 upper-stage prototypes before 2019, at the SpaceX facilities in Boca Chica, Texas, and Cocoa, Florida, respectively [137] Neither prototype flew: Mk1 was destroyed in November 2019 during a pressure stress test and Mk2's Florida facility was deconstructed throughout 2020 [138] [73]\n\n\nSN8 to SN15\nStarship SN8 was the first full-sized upper-stage prototype, though it lacked a heat shield [145] It underwent four preliminary static fire tests between October and November 2020 [140] On 9 December 2020, SN8 flew, slowly turning off its three engines one by one, and reached an altitude of 12.5 km (7.8 mi) After SN8 dove back to the ground, its engines were hampered by low methane header tank pressure during the landing attempt, which led to a hard impact with the landing pad and subsequent explosion of the vehicle [65]\n\n\nIntegrated flight tests (2023–)\nIn June 2022, the Federal Aviation Administration determined that SpaceX must address more than 75 issues identified in the preliminary environmental assessment before integrated flight tests could start [159]\n\n\nFirst flight test\nIn July 2022, Booster 7 tested the liquid oxygen turbopumps on all thirty-three Raptor engines, resulting in an explosion at the vehicle's base, which destroyed a pressure pipe and caused minor damage to the launchpad [160] By the end of November, Ship 24 had performed 2 static test fires, [161]: 20  while Booster 7 had performed 6 static test fires [162] [161]: 20  and finally on 9 February 2023, a static fire with 31 engines at 50% throttle [163] In January 2023, the whole Starship stack underwent a full wet dress rehearsal [164]\n\n\nSecond flight test\nAfter the first test flight, SpaceX began work on the launch mount to repair the damage it sustained during the test and to prevent future issues The foundation of the launch tower was reinforced and a water powered flame deflector was built under the launch mount [176] Ship 25 and Booster 9 were rolled to the suborbital and orbital launch sites in May to undergo multiple tests [177] [178]\n\n\nThird flight test\nFollowing the second flight test (which saw the loss of both stages), significant changes were implemented, including upgrading Starship's thrust vector control system to electric thrust vector control (TVC) [185] and measures to delay liquid oxygen (LOX) [185] venting until after Starship engine cutoff (SECO) has taken place.\n\n\nFourth flight test\nThe fourth integrated flight test of the full Starship configuration launched on 6 June 2024, at 7:50 AM CDT [196] The goals for the test flight were for the Super Heavy booster to land on a 'virtual tower' in the ocean, and for the Ship to survive peak heating during atmospheric reentry [100] The flight test was successful in both regards, with Super Heavy achieving a soft splashdown and Ship surviving atmospheric reentry and a controlled splashdown [197]\n\n\nFifth flight test\nIn April 2024, Musk stated one of the goals was to attempt a booster tower landing based on successful booster performance in flight 4 Vehicle testing commenced in May 2024 [198] SpaceX claimed that B12 and S30 were ready to launch in early August, in advance of regulatory approval [199] SpaceX flew S30 and B12 on 13 October 2024, with B12 returning to the launch site for a successful catch for the first time, and S30 successfully splashing down in the Indian Ocean [200]\n\n\nSixth flight test\nShip 31, slated for flight 6, completed a successful cryogenic test in July 2024 and a static fire in September [201] [202]\n\n\nCost and funding\nSpaceX develops the Starship primarily with private funding [203] [130] [1] SpaceX Chief Financial Officer Bret Johnsen disclosed in court that SpaceX has invested more than $3 billion into the Starbase facility and Starship systems from July 2014 to May 2023 [1] Elon Musk stated in April 2023 that SpaceX expected to spend about $2 billion on Starship development in 2023 [204] [205] In a 2024 response to a lawsuit, SpaceX stated that the cost of the Starship program was approximately $4 million per day [206]: 25–26  Adding that any day of delay to the Starship program represented a loss of $100,000 [206]: 25–26 \n\n\nLaunch history\nStarship vehicles have been launched 5 times for flight tests over 2 years, resulting in 3 successes (60%), and 2 failures Starship Block 1 has been launched five times between April 2023 to October 2024, and will be replaced by Block 2 ships after another flight [215] Block 1 boosters are expected to fly further into the future [216]\n\n\nPotential missions\nSpaceX plans to use Starship to launch the second generation of satellites for SpaceX's Starlink system, which currently delivers high-speed internet to over 70 countries [217] An analyst at financial services company Morgan Stanley stated development of Starship and Starlink are intertwined, with Starship's planned launch capacity enabling cheaper Starlink launches, and Starlink's profits financing Starship's development costs [218] In deficit from its inception until the end of 2022, [219] Starlink was first reported to be cash flow positive in the first quarter of 2023, [220] [221] though Elon Musk said that Starlink had only reached \"break-even cashflow\" in 2023 [222] In December 2023, the FCC issued a final denial of a $885M Starlink subsidy because of Starlink's \"continuing inability to successfully launch on the Starship rocket\" [223]\n\n\nStarlink\nSpaceX plans to use Starship to launch the second generation of satellites for SpaceX's Starlink system, which currently delivers high-speed internet to over 70

subsidy because of Starlink's \"continuing inability to successfully launch on the Starship rocket\" [223]\n\n\nArtemis Program\nStarship HLS was initially chosen by NASA as the sole lunar Human Landing System for the planned Artemis III and Artemis IV crewed missions, as part of the Artemis program [79] [224] Starship HLS is to be launched into a low Earth orbit, and refueled by multiple Starship tanker spacecraft [225]: 4, 5  Once fueled, it would perform a trans lunar injection burn and enter a near-rectilinear halo orbit [226] around the Moon, with a perilune of 1,500 km (930 mi) occurring over the north pole and an apolune of 70,000 km (43,000 mi) occurring over the south pole [226] [225]: 4, 5  The Orion spacecraft would then dock with Starship HLS and two of its four crew would transfer into Starship HLS [227] [225]: 4, 5  Starship HLS would then use its engines to make a powered descent and land near the lunar south pole [225]: 4, 5  After the crew performs the surface portion of its mission, the HLS would ascend with the crew [225]: 4, 5  The crew would then transfer into the Orion spacecraft and return to Earth [225]: 4, 5 \n\n\nAstronomy\nAstronomers have called to consider Starship's larger mass to orbit and wider cargo bay for proposed space telescopes such as LUVOIR, and to develop larger telescopes to take advantage of these capabilities [228] [229] Starship's 9 m (30 ft) fairing width could hold an 8 m (26 ft) wide space telescope mirror in a single piece, [228] alleviating the need for complex unfolding such as that of the JWST's 6.5 m (21 ft) mirror, which added cost and delays [229] Ariane 5 imposed a ~6,500 kg limit on the telescope's weight [230] Whereas Starship's low launch cost could also allow probes to use heavier, more common, cheaper materials, such as glass instead of beryllium for large telescope mirrors [229] [78] With a 5 t (11,000 lb) mirror built using similar methods to the Hubble Space Telescope's mirror, the JWST would represent only 10% of the mass deliverable by a (refueled) Starship to the Sun–Earth L2 point, and therefore minimizing the weight of the telescope would not have been a dominant design consideration [229]\n\n\nRocket cargo\nIn January 2022, SpaceX was awarded a $102 million five-year contract to develop the Rocket Cargo program for the United States Space Force [214] The five-year contract is intended to \"determine exactly what a rocket can achieve when used for cargo transport\", [232] and will see the Air Force Research Laboratory collect data during commercial launches of Starship [232] The contract includes an eventual demonstration mission with the launch and landing of a cargo-laden Starship in a point-to-point flight.\n\n\nMars Sample Return\nIn 2024, the NASA-ESA Mars Sample Return project, one of NASA's highest priority flagship projects, suffered a setback when an independent review board assessing the project's feasibility concluded that the project could not complete under its mission profile In April 2024, the Administrator of NASA then announced that a new mission profile was needed for the project and that NASA would turn to industry for proposals, with responses due in fall 2024, and high emphasis on lower total cost and lower risk [234] Starship was widely seen as a leading candidate to serve as a central component of the new mission profile architecture [235] [236] [237]\n\n\nOther missions\nOne future payload is the Superbird-9 communication satellite, which was Starship's first contract for externally made commercial satellites [238] Another planned payload is the Starlab space station, which Starship will launch in a single piece [239]\n\n\nPotential use cases\nOpinions differ on how Starship's planned low launch cost could affect the cost of space science According to Waleed Abdalati, former NASA Chief Scientist, the planned low launch cost could reduce the cost of satellite replacement and enable more ambitious missions for budget-limited programs due to the higher percentage of the total budget taken up by launch costs for lower budget missions [242] According to Lionnet, low launch cost might not reduce the overall cost of a science mission significantly: of the Rosetta space probe and Philae lander's mission cost of $1.7 billion, the cost of launch (by the expendable Ariane 5) only made up ten percent [242] Similarly the Juno mission had a total budget of $1.13 billion, [243] with launch cost of $190 million [244] making up only seventeen percent of the budget.\n\n\nSpace science\nOpinions

under an hour [245] [232] Musk stated that SpaceX would complete hundreds of cargo flights before launching with human passengers [246]\n\n\nSpace colonization\nAccording to SpaceX, Starship is intended to be able to land crews on Mars, [247]: 120  though SpaceX has not published technical plans or designs about Starship's life support systems, radiation protection, docking system, or in-orbit refueling system for Mars [77] [248] The spacecraft would be launched to low Earth orbit and refueled in orbit before heading to Mars [249] After landing on Mars, the Sabatier reaction could be used to synthesize liquid methane and liquid oxygen, Starship's fuel, in a power-to-gas plant [250] The plant's raw resources would be Martian water and Martian carbon dioxide [89] On Earth, similar technologies could be used to make carbon-neutral propellant for the rocket [251] To date, there has been one proof of concept experiment (MOXIE) demonstrating the extraction of oxygen from Martian carbon dioxide, with George Dvorsky writing for Gizmodo commenting that we are not \"remotely close\" to turning this \"into something practical\" [80]\n\n\nFacilities\nStarbase consists of a

Administration began the process of preparing an environmental impact statement (EIS) evaluating the potential impacts of the new infrastructure and a higher launch cadence of up to 44 per year at LC-39A [262]\n\n\nResponses to Starship development\nIn order to compete with SpaceX and close their technological gap with the company, the China Aerospace Science and Tech Corp and other aerospace actors in China have reportedly been working on their own equivalent of Starship – the Long March 9 super-heavy lift rocket, [269] which is also designed to eventually be fully reusable [270] In 2021, the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT) showed a rendered video of a rocket noted to be \"strikingly\" similar to Starship in appearance and function [271] In a 2022 event organized by the International Astronautical Federation and the Chinese Society of Astronautics, the CALT communicated performing research on a crewed launch vehicle powered by LOX-methane propellant, with a second stage that was very similar to Starship's [272]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**SpaceX Starship Development**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSpaceX's Starship is a next-generation spacecraft designed to take humans and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations in the solar system. The spacecraft is being developed by SpaceX, a private aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company founded by Elon Musk. The Starship program aims to create a reusable spacecraft capable of carrying large payloads and crew members to various destinations in space.\n\n**Description**\n\nWhen stacked and fully fueled, Starship has a mass of approximately 5,000 tons, a diameter of 9 meters, and a height of 121.3 meters. The rocket has been designed with the goal of being fully reusable to reduce launch costs. It consists of the Super Heavy first-stage booster and the Starship spacecraft, which are powered by Raptor and Raptor Vacuum engines. The bodies of both rocket stages are made from stainless steel and are manufactured by stacking and welding stainless steel cylinders.\n\n**Super Heavy Booster**\n\nThe Super Heavy booster is 71 meters tall, 9 meters wide, and is composed of four general sections: the engines, the fuel tank, the oxygen tank, and the interstage. Elon Musk stated in 2021 that the final design will have a dry mass between 160 tons and 200 tons, with the tanks weighing 80 tons and the interstage 20 tons. The booster's tanks are separated by a common bulkhead, similar to the ones used on the S-II and S-IVB stages on the Saturn V rocket.\n\n**Tanks**\n\nThe propellant tanks on Super Heavy are separated by a common bulkhead, similar to the ones used on the S-II and S-IVB stages on the Saturn V rocket. After Starship's Second Flight Test, the common dome's design was changed to a more elliptical dome, which has changed the propellant capacity of both tanks by an unknown, but likely negligible, amount. Both tanks are heavily reinforced, with roughly 74 stringers attached to the interior walls of the tanks.\n\n**Propulsion**\n\nSuper Heavy is powered by thirty-three Raptor engines, which are housed within a dedicated shielding compartment. This compartment is not present before engine installation, thus, boosters are roughly three meters shorter before engine installation. The outer twenty engines, arranged in a single ring, are in a fixed position. In order to save weight, these engines are started using ground support equipment on the launch mount and cannot be reignited for subsequent burns.\n\n**Interstage**\n\nThe interstage is also equipped with four electrically actuated grid fins made out of stainless steel, each with a mass of 3 tons. These grid fins are paired together, with the fins in each pair being sixty degrees apart from each other, differing from the Falcon 9 booster, which has titanium grid fins mounted ninety degrees from each other. This is done to improve control in the pitch axis. Additionally, these fins remain extended during ascent in order to save weight.\n\n**Starship Spacecraft**\n\nThe current Block 1 of the Starship spacecraft is 50.3 meters tall, 9 meters in diameter, and has 6 Raptor engines, 3 of which are optimized for use in outer space. The future Block 3 of the Starship spacecraft is planned to have an additional 3 Raptor Vacuum engines for increased payload capacity. Starship's payload bay, measuring 17 meters tall by 8 meters in diameter, is the largest of any active or planned launch vehicle.\n\n**Heat Shield**\n\nStarship's heat shield is composed of 18,000 hexagonal black tiles that can withstand temperatures of 1,400°C. It is designed to protect the vehicle during atmospheric entry and to be used multiple times with minimal maintenance between flights. The silica-based tiles are attached to Starship with pins and have small gaps in between to allow for heat expansion.\n\n**Variants**\n\nFor satellite launch, Starship is planned to have a large cargo door that opens to release payloads, similar to NASA's Space Shuttle. Instead of a cleanroom, payloads are integrated directly into Starship's payload bay, which requires purging the payload bay with temperature-controlled ISO class 8 clean air. To deploy Starlink satellites, the cargo door is to be replaced with a slot and dispenser rack, whose mechanism has been compared to a Pez candy dispenser.\n\n**Raptor Engine**\n\nThe Raptor engine is a family of rocket engines developed by SpaceX for use in Starship and Super Heavy vehicles. It burns liquid oxygen and methane in an efficient and complex full-flow staged combustion power cycle. The Raptor engine uses methane as fuel rather than kerosene because methane gives higher performance and prevents the build-up of deposits in the engine from coking.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe Starship program has undergone several design iterations and prototype tests, including the successful completion of the first static fire test in January 2021. The program has also faced several setbacks, including the loss of the first two prototype vehicles, SN8 and SN9, during test flights.

Wikipedia-style article in English about \"SpaceX_Starship_development\" following this outline:\n\n\nDescription\nWhen stacked and fully fueled, Starship has a mass of approximately 5,000 t (11,000,000 lb), [b] a diameter of 9 m (30 ft) [12] and a height of 121.3 m (398 ft) [13] The rocket has been designed with the goal of being fully reusable to reduce launch costs; [14] it consists of the Super Heavy first-stage booster and the Starship spacecraft [15] which are powered by Raptor and Raptor Vacuum engines [16] The bodies of both rocket stages are made from stainless steel [17] and are manufactured by stacking and welding stainless steel cylinders [18] These cylinders have a height of 1.8 m (5 ft 11 in), a thickness of 4 mm (0.16 in) and a mass of 1,600 kg (3,500 lb) each [18] Domes inside the spacecraft separate the methane and oxygen tanks [18] SpaceX has stated that Starship, in its \"baseline reuseable design\", will have a payload capacity of 100–150 t (220,000–331,000 lb) to low earth orbit and 27 t (60,000 lb) to geostationary transfer orbit [19] [20]\n\n\nSuper Heavy booster\nSuper Heavy is 71 m (233 ft) tall, 9 m (30 ft) wide, [12] and is composed of four general sections: the engines, the fuel tank, the oxygen tank, and the interstage [3] Elon Musk stated in 2021 that the final design will have a dry mass between 160 t (350,000 lb) and 200 t (440,000 lb), with the tanks weighing 80 t (180,000 lb) and the interstage 20 t (44,000 lb) [3]\n\n\nTanks\nThe propellant tanks on Super Heavy are separated by a common bulkhead, similar to the ones used on the S-II and S-IVB stages on the Saturn V rocket [21] [22] After Starship's Second Flight Test, the common dome's design was changed to a more elliptical dome, [23] which has changed the propellant capacity of both tanks by an unknown, but likely negligible, amount [23] Both tanks are heavily reinforced, with roughly 74 stringers attached to the interior walls of the tanks [24] The booster's tanks hold 3,400 t (7,500,000 lb) of propellant, [25] consisting of 2,700 t (6,000,000 lb) of liquid oxygen and 700 t (1,500,000 lb) of liquid methane [c]\n\n\nPropulsion\nSuper Heavy is powered by thirty-three Raptor engines, which are housed within a dedicated shielding compartment [34] This compartment is not present before engine installation, thus, boosters are roughly three meters shorter before engine installation [35] The outer twenty engines, arranged in a single ring, are in a fixed position [34] In order to save weight these engines are started using ground support equipment on the launch mount and cannot be reignited for subsequent burns [36] The inner thirteen engines are attached to an adapter, which rests directly against the thrust puck/aft dome assembly [34] These engines are equipped with gimbal actuators, and are capable of reigniting for the boostback and landing burns [37] After Starship's first flight test, this gimbaling system was switched from a hydraulic system to an electric one, enabling the removal of the hydraulic power units [38] This change was made to the upper stage after the second flight test During the ascent burn and boostback burns, the engines draw propellant from the main tanks, with the liquid oxygen being drawn from a dedicated header tank during the landing burn [29] Like the thrust vector control system, the engine shielding, which isolates individual engines in the event of a failure, was upgraded after Starship's first flight test, alongside the fire suppression system [38] This system uses CO2 tanks to purge the individual engine compartments during flight, as well as a nitrogen purge while on the launch pad [39] The aft bay has eighteen vents visible on the outside of the booster, which are believed to be connected to the outer twenty engines, [39] while the center engines vent directly below the launch pad [39]\n\n\nInterstage\n\nThe interstage is also equipped with four electrically actuated grid fins made out of stainless steel, each with a mass of 3 t (6,600 lb) [49] These grid fins are paired together, with the fins in each pair being sixty degrees apart from each other, differing from the Falcon 9 booster, which has titanium grid fins mounted ninety degrees from each other [50] [51] This is done to improve control in the pitch axis [51] Additionally, these fins remain extended during ascent in order to save weight [3] The interstage also has protruding hardpoints, located between grid fins, allowing the booster to be lifted or caught by the launch tower [52] The ability to lift a booster from these hardpoints was proven on August 23, 2022, when Booster 7 was lifted onto OLM A [53] The first catch of a booster occurred on October 13, 2024, using Booster 12 [54]\n\nStarship spacecraft\n\nThe current Block 1 of the Starship spacecraft is 50.3 m (165 ft) tall, 9 m (30 ft) in diameter, and has 6 Raptor engines, 3 of which are optimized for use in outer space [12] [60] The future Block 3 of the Starship spacecraft is planned to have an additional 3 Raptor Vacuum engines for increased payload capacity Starship Block 1's payload bay, measuring 17 m (56 ft) tall by 8 m (26 ft) in diameter, is the largest of any active or planned launch vehicle; its internal volume of 1,000 m3 (35,000 cu ft) is slightly larger than the International Space Station's pressurized volume [61] SpaceX will also provide a 22 m (72 ft) tall payload bay configuration for even larger payloads [19]\n\nHeat shield\nStarship's heat shield is composed of eighteen thousand [68] [69] hexagonal black tiles that can withstand temperatures of 1,400 °C (2,600 °F) [70] [71] It is designed to protect the vehicle during atmospheric entry and to be used multiple times with minimal maintenance between flights [72] The silica-based tiles [73] are attached to Starship with pins [71] and have small gaps in between to allow for heat expansion [3] After IFT-4, SpaceX added a secondary ablative layer under the primary heat shield [74] The total mass of the heat shield and ablative layer is 10.5 t (23,000 lb) [75]\n\n\nVariants\nFor satellite launch, Starship is planned to have a large cargo door that opens to release payloads, similar to NASA's Space Shuttle, and close upon reentry instead of a jettisonable nosecone fairing Instead of a cleanroom, payloads are integrated directly into Starship's payload bay, which requires purging the payload bay with temperature-controlled ISO class 8 clean air [19] To deploy Starlink satellites, the cargo door is to be replaced with a slot and dispenser rack, whose mechanism has been compared to a Pez candy dispenser [76]\n\n\nRaptor engine\nRaptor is a family of rocket engines developed by SpaceX for use in Starship and Super Heavy vehicles It burns liquid oxygen and methane in an efficient and complex full-flow staged combustion power cycle The Raptor engine uses methane as fuel rather than kerosene because methane gives higher performance and prevents the build-up of deposits in the engine from coking [87] [88] Methane can also be produced from carbon dioxide and water using the Sabatier reaction [89] The engines are designed to be reused many times with little maintenance [90]\n\n\nVersions\nOn April 4, 2024, Elon Musk provided an update on Starship at Starbase, where two new versions of Starship were announced, Block 2 and Block 3 [93] [94]\n\n\nBlock 1\nAs of October 13, 2024, Block 1 has been used for all 5 Integrated Flight Tests [95] [96]\n\n\nBlock 2\nAs of April 2024, exact specifications are not known for the Block 2 vehicle; however, the Block 2 ships will feature a thinner forward flap design, a 25% increase in propellant capacity, integrated vented interstage, and an increase in thrust [97] [98] The vehicle will be a total of 3.1 m (10 ft) taller than the previous Block 1 vehicle, and is planned to have a payload capacity of at least 100 tons to orbit when reused [97] Additionally, the engine type will switch to Raptor 3, which removes the need for secondary engine shielding [99] The capacity to manufacture Block 2 became possible as a large portion of the Starfactory was commissioned in 2024 [7]\n\n\nBlock 3\nAs of June 2024, the Block 3 final configuration is unknown The most recent configuration, as described in regulatory filings submitted to the FAA, has a height of 150 m (490 ft) [45] The Starship second stage will feature 9 Raptor engines, while the Super Heavy booster will have up to 35 [45] It is planned to have a payload capacity of at least 200 tons to orbit when reused [100]\n\n\nPlanned launch and landing profile\nPayloads are planned to be integrated into Starship at a separate facility and then rolled out to the launch site [101] Super Heavy and Starship are then to be stacked onto their launch mount and loaded with fuel via the ship quick disconnect (SQD) arm and booster quick disconnect (BQD) [52] The SQD and BQD retract, all thirty-three engines of Super Heavy ignite, and the rocket lifts off [52]\n\n\nDevelopment\nIn November 2005, [116] before SpaceX had launched its first rocket the Falcon 1, [117] CEO Elon Musk first mentioned a high-capacity rocket concept able to launch 100 t (220,000 lb) to low Earth orbit, dubbed the BFR [116] Later in 2012, Elon Musk first publicly announced plans to develop a rocket surpassing the capabilities of Space X's existing Falcon 9 [118] SpaceX called it the Mars Colonial Transporter, as the rocket was to transport humans to Mars and back [119] In 2016, the descriptor was changed to Interplanetary Transport System, as the rocket was planned to travel beyond Mars as well [120] The conceptual design called for a carbon fiber structure, [121] a mass in excess of 10,000 t (22,000,000 lb) when fully fueled, a payload of 300 t (660,000 lb) to low Earth orbit while being fully reusable [121] By 2017, the concept was again re-dubbed the BFR [122]\n\n\nEarly design concepts (2012–2019)\nIn November 2005, [116] before SpaceX had launched its first rocket the Falcon 1, [117] CEO Elon Musk first mentioned a high-capacity rocket concept able

300 t (660,000 lb) to low Earth orbit while being fully reusable [121] By 2017, the concept was again re-dubbed the BFR [122]\n\n\nLow-altitude flight tests (2019–2021)\nThe first tests started with the construction of the first prototype in 2018, Starhopper, which performed several static fires and two successful low-altitude flights in 2019 [136] SpaceX began constructing the first full-size Starship MK1 and Mk2 upper-stage prototypes before 2019, at the SpaceX facilities in Boca Chica, Texas, and Cocoa, Florida, respectively [137] Neither prototype flew: Mk1 was destroyed in November 2019 during a pressure stress test and Mk2's Florida facility was deconstructed throughout 2020 [138] [73]\n\n\nStarhopper to SN6\nThe first tests started with the construction of the first prototype in 2018, Starhopper, which performed several static fires and two successful low-altitude flights in 2019 [136] SpaceX began constructing the first full-size Starship MK1 and Mk2 upper-stage prototypes before 2019, at the SpaceX facilities in Boca Chica, Texas, and Cocoa, Florida, respectively [137] Neither prototype flew: Mk1 was destroyed in November 2019 during a pressure stress test and Mk2's Florida facility was deconstructed throughout 2020 [138] [73]\n\n\nSN8 to SN15\nStarship SN8 was the first full-sized upper-stage prototype, though it lacked a heat shield [145] It underwent four preliminary static fire tests between October and November 2020 [140] On 9 December 2020, SN8 flew, slowly turning off its three engines one by one, and reached an altitude of 12.5 km (7.8 mi) After SN8 dove back to the ground, its engines were hampered by low methane header tank pressure during the landing attempt, which led to a hard impact with the landing pad and subsequent explosion of the vehicle [65]\n\n\nIntegrated flight tests (2023–)\nIn June 2022, the Federal Aviation Administration determined that SpaceX must address more than 75 issues identified in the preliminary environmental assessment before integrated flight tests could start [159]\n\n\nFirst flight test\nIn July 2022, Booster 7 tested the liquid oxygen turbopumps on all thirty-three Raptor engines, resulting in an explosion at the vehicle's base, which destroyed a pressure pipe and caused minor damage to the launchpad [160] By the end of November, Ship 24 had performed 2 static test fires, [161]: 20  while Booster 7 had performed 6 static test fires [162] [161]: 20  and finally on 9 February 2023, a static fire with 31 engines at 50% throttle [163] In January 2023, the whole Starship stack underwent a full wet dress rehearsal [164]\n\n\nSecond flight test\nAfter the first test flight, SpaceX began work on the launch mount to repair the damage it sustained during the test and to prevent future issues The foundation of the launch tower was reinforced and a water powered flame deflector was built under the launch mount [176] Ship 25 and Booster 9 were rolled to the suborbital and orbital launch sites in May to undergo multiple tests [177] [178]\n\n\nThird flight test\nFollowing the second flight test (which saw the loss of both stages), significant changes were implemented, including upgrading Starship's thrust vector control system to electric thrust vector control (TVC) [185] and measures to delay liquid oxygen (LOX) [185] venting until after Starship engine cutoff (SECO) has taken place.\n\n\nFourth flight test\nThe fourth integrated flight test of the full Starship configuration launched on 6 June 2024, at 7:50 AM CDT [196] The goals for the test flight were for the Super Heavy booster to land on a 'virtual tower' in the ocean, and for the Ship to survive peak heating during atmospheric reentry [100] The flight test was successful in both regards, with Super Heavy achieving a soft splashdown and Ship surviving atmospheric reentry and a controlled splashdown [197]\n\n\nFifth flight test\nIn April 2024, Musk stated one of the goals was to attempt a booster tower landing based on successful booster performance in flight 4 Vehicle testing commenced in May 2024 [198] SpaceX claimed that B12 and S30 were ready to launch in early August, in advance of regulatory approval [199] SpaceX flew S30 and B12 on 13 October 2024, with B12 returning to the launch site for a successful catch for the first time, and S30 successfully splashing down in the Indian Ocean [200]\n\n\nSixth flight test\nShip 31, slated for flight 6, completed a successful cryogenic test in July 2024 and a static fire in September [201] [202]\n\n\nCost and funding\nSpaceX develops the Starship primarily with private funding [203] [130] [1] SpaceX Chief Financial Officer Bret Johnsen disclosed in court that SpaceX has invested more than $3 billion into the Starbase facility and Starship systems from July 2014 to May 2023 [1] Elon Musk stated in April 2023 that SpaceX expected to spend about $2 billion on Starship development in 2023 [204] [205] In a 2024 response to a lawsuit, SpaceX stated that the cost of the Starship program was approximately $4 million per day [206]: 25–26  Adding that any day of delay to the Starship program represented a loss of $100,000 [206]: 25–26 \n\n\nLaunch history\nStarship vehicles have been launched 5 times for flight tests over 2 years, resulting in 3 successes (60%), and 2 failures Starship Block 1 has been launched five times between April 2023 to October 2024, and will be replaced by Block 2 ships after another flight [215] Block 1 boosters are expected to fly further into the future [216]\n\n\nPotential missions\nSpaceX plans to use Starship to launch the second generation of satellites for SpaceX's Starlink system, which currently delivers high-speed internet to over 70 countries [217] An analyst at financial services company Morgan Stanley stated development of Starship and Starlink are intertwined, with Starship's planned launch capacity enabling cheaper Starlink launches, and Starlink's profits financing Starship's development costs [218] In deficit from its inception until the end of 2022, [219] Starlink was first reported to be cash flow positive in the first quarter of 2023, [220] [221] though Elon Musk said that Starlink had only reached \"break-even cashflow\" in 2023 [222] In December 2023, the FCC issued a final denial of a $885M Starlink subsidy because of Starlink's \"continuing inability to successfully launch on the Starship rocket\" [223]\n\n\nStarlink\nSpaceX plans to use Starship to launch the second generation of satellites for

[222] In December 2023, the FCC issued a final denial of a $885M Starlink subsidy because of Starlink's \"continuing inability to successfully launch on the Starship rocket\" [223]\n\n\nArtemis Program\nStarship HLS was initially chosen by NASA as the sole lunar Human Landing System for the planned Artemis III and Artemis IV crewed missions, as part of the Artemis program [79] [224] Starship HLS is to be launched into a low Earth orbit, and refueled by multiple Starship tanker spacecraft [225]: 4, 5  Once fueled, it would perform a trans lunar injection burn and enter a near-rectilinear halo orbit [226] around the Moon, with a perilune of 1,500 km (930 mi) occurring over the north pole and an apolune of 70,000 km (43,000 mi) occurring over the south pole [226] [225]: 4, 5  The Orion spacecraft would then dock with Starship HLS and two of its four crew would transfer into Starship HLS [227] [225]: 4, 5  Starship HLS would then use its engines to make a powered descent and land near the lunar south pole [225]: 4, 5  After the crew performs the surface portion of its mission, the HLS would ascend with the crew [225]: 4, 5  The crew would then transfer into the Orion spacecraft and return to Earth [225]: 4, 5 \n\n\nAstronomy\nAstronomers have called to consider Starship's larger mass to orbit and wider cargo bay for proposed space telescopes such as LUVOIR, and to develop larger telescopes to take advantage of these capabilities [228] [229] Starship's 9 m (30 ft) fairing width could hold an 8 m (26 ft) wide space telescope mirror in a single piece, [228] alleviating the need for complex unfolding such as that of the JWST's 6.5 m (21 ft) mirror, which added cost and delays [229] Ariane 5 imposed a ~6,500 kg limit on the telescope's weight [230] Whereas Starship's low launch cost could also allow probes to use heavier, more common, cheaper materials, such as glass instead of beryllium for large telescope mirrors [229] [78] With a 5 t (11,000 lb) mirror built using similar methods to the Hubble Space Telescope's mirror, the JWST would represent only 10% of the mass deliverable by a (refueled) Starship to the Sun–Earth L2 point, and therefore minimizing the weight of the telescope would not have been a dominant design consideration [229]\n\n\nRocket cargo\nIn January 2022, SpaceX was awarded a $102 million five-year contract to develop the Rocket Cargo program for the United States Space Force [214] The five-year contract is intended to \"determine exactly what a rocket can achieve when used for cargo transport\", [232] and will see the Air Force Research Laboratory collect data during commercial launches of Starship [232] The contract includes an eventual demonstration mission with the launch and landing of a cargo-laden Starship in a point-to-point flight.\n\n\nMars Sample Return\nIn 2024, the NASA-ESA Mars Sample Return project, one of NASA's highest priority flagship projects, suffered a setback when an independent review board assessing the project's feasibility concluded that the project could not complete under its mission profile In April 2024, the Administrator of NASA then announced that a new mission profile was needed for the project and that NASA would turn to industry for proposals, with responses due in fall 2024, and high emphasis on lower total cost and lower risk [234] Starship was widely seen as a leading candidate to serve as a central component of the new mission profile architecture [235] [236] [237]\n\n\nOther missions\nOne future payload is the Superbird-9 communication satellite, which was Starship's first contract for externally made commercial satellites [238] Another planned payload is the Starlab space station, which Starship will launch in a single piece [239]\n\n\nPotential use cases\nOpinions differ on how Starship's planned low launch cost could affect the cost of space science According to Waleed Abdalati, former NASA Chief Scientist, the planned low launch cost could reduce the cost of satellite replacement and enable more ambitious missions for budget-limited programs due to the higher percentage of the total budget taken up by launch costs for lower budget missions [242] According to Lionnet, low launch cost might not reduce the overall cost of a science mission significantly: of the Rosetta space probe and Philae lander's mission cost of $1.7 billion, the cost of launch (by the expendable Ariane 5) only made up ten percent [242] Similarly the Juno mission had a total budget of $1.13 billion, [243] with launch cost of $190 million [244] making up only seventeen percent of the budget.\n\n\nSpace science\nOpinions differ on how Starship's planned low launch cost could affect the cost of space science According to Waleed Abdalati, former NASA

with launch cost of $190 million [244] making up only seventeen percent of the budget.\n\n\nTransportation\nOne possible future use of Starship that SpaceX has proposed is point-to-point flights (called \"Earth to Earth\" flights by SpaceX), traveling anywhere on Earth in under an hour [245] [232] Musk stated that SpaceX would complete hundreds of cargo flights before launching with human passengers [246]\n\n\nSpace colonization\nAccording to SpaceX, Starship is intended to be able to land crews on Mars, [247]: 120  though SpaceX has not published technical plans or designs about Starship's life support systems, radiation protection, docking system, or in-orbit refueling system for Mars [77] [248] The spacecraft would be launched to low Earth orbit and refueled in orbit before heading to Mars [249] After landing on Mars, the Sabatier reaction could be used to synthesize liquid methane and liquid oxygen, Starship's fuel, in a power-to-gas plant [250] The plant's raw resources would be Martian water and Martian carbon dioxide [89] On Earth, similar technologies could be used to make carbon-neutral propellant for the rocket [251] To date, there has been one proof of concept experiment (MOXIE) demonstrating the extraction of oxygen from Martian carbon dioxide, with George Dvorsky writing for Gizmodo commenting that we are not \"remotely close\" to turning this \"into something practical\" [80]\n\n\nFacilities\nStarbase consists of a manufacturing facility and launch site, [256] and is located at Boca Chica, Texas Both facilities operate twenty-four hours a

before it lifts off [52]\n\n\nFlorida\nSpaceX has been constructing a Starship launch pad at Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) since 2021 The site was leased to the company in 2014 and is used to launch Falcon 9 rockets [259] [261] In 2024, the Federal Aviation Administration began the process of preparing an environmental impact statement (EIS) evaluating the potential impacts of the new infrastructure and a higher launch cadence of up to 44 per year at LC-39A [262]\n\n\nResponses to Starship development\nIn order to compete with SpaceX and close their technological gap with the company, the China Aerospace Science and Tech Corp and other aerospace actors in China have reportedly been working on their own equivalent of Starship – the Long March 9 super-heavy lift rocket, [269] which is also designed to eventually be fully reusable [270] In 2021, the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT) showed a rendered video of a rocket noted to be \"strikingly\" similar to Starship in appearance and function [271] In a 2022 event organized by the International Astronautical Federation and the Chinese Society of Astronautics, the CALT communicated performing research on a crewed launch vehicle powered by LOX-methane propellant, with a second stage that was very similar to Starship's [272]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal

[38] In 1883, Allan Octavian Hume, a retired British Civil Servant also known for his pro-Indian activities, outlined his idea for a body representing Indian interests in an open letter to graduates of the University of Calcutta [38] The aim was to obtain a greater share in government for educated Indians and to create a platform for civic and political dialogue between them and the British Raj Hume initiated contact with prominent leaders in India and conducted the first session of the Indian National Congress at Gokuldas Tejpal Sanskrit College in Bombay from 28 to 31 December 1885 [39] A notice convening the first meeting of the Indian National Union to be held in Poona the following December, was issued [40] However, due to a cholera outbreak there it was moved to Bombay [41] [42] In its first two decades of formation, Congress was an assembly for politically minded individuals interested in various reforms, but it did not express desires for independence from the British Empire [43]\n\n\nEarly years\nBy 1905, two factions had emerged within the party, leading to different approaches and ideologies regarding the methods to achieve self-rule for India.\nA division arose between the Moderates, led by Gopal Krishna Gokhale, who believed in a peaceful and constitutional approach to achieve reforms and self-governance within the framework of the British Empire [50] They aimed to collaborate with British authorities and use constitutional means, such as petitions, resolutions, and dialogue, to address the grievances of Indians On the other hand, the faction led by Extremist or Radical leaders, including Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal, and Lala Lajpat Rai, was more radical in their approach They believed in direct action and criticized the moderate approach, advocating for more assertive and aggressive means to achieve self-rule They were less willing to compromise with the British and focused on building mass support and national unity to attain their objectives [51] Bal Gangadhar Tilak, tried to mobilise Hindu Indians by appealing to an explicitly Hindu political identity displayed in the annual public Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav and Shiv Jayanti festivals that he inaugurated in western India [52] However, the ideological differences between the extremists and moderates led to a deep divide During its session held in Surat in December 1907, a split occurred between two factions within the Congress known as Surat Split [53]\n\n\nCongress as a mass movement\nIn 1915, Mahatma Gandhi returned from South Africa and joined Congress [55] [56] His efforts in South Africa were well known not only among the educated but also among the masses During 1917 and 1918, Mahatma Gandhi was involved in three struggles– known as Champaran Satyagraha, Ahmedabad Mill Strike and Kheda Satyagraha [57] [58] [59] After World War I, the party came to be associated with Gandhi, who remained its unofficial spiritual leader and icon [60] He formed an alliance with the Khilafat Movement in 1920 as part of his opposition to British rule in India, [61] and fought for the rights for Indians using civil disobedience or Satyagraha as the tool for agitation [62] In 1922, after the deaths of policemen at Chauri Chaura, Gandhi suspended the agitation.\n\n\nPost-independence\nAfter Indian independence in 1947, the Indian National Congress became the dominant political party in the country In 1952, in the first general election held after Independence, the party swept to power in the national parliament and most state legislatures It held power nationally until 1977 when it was defeated by the Janata coalition It returned to power in 1980 and ruled until 1989 when it was once again defeated The party formed the government in 1991 at the head of a coalition, as well as in 2004 and 2009 when it led the United Progressive Alliance During this period the Congress remained centre-left in its social policies while steadily shifting from a socialist to a neoliberal economic outlook [85] The Party's rivals at state level have been national parties including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPIM), and various regional parties, such as the Telugu Desam Party, Trinamool Congress and Aam Aadmi Party [86]\n\n\nNehru and Shastri era (1947–1966)\nFrom 1951 until his death in 1964, Jawaharlal Nehru was the paramount leader of the party Congress gained power in landslide victories in the general elections of 1951–52, 1957, and 1962 [90] During his tenure, Nehru implemented policies based on import substitution industrialisation, and advocated a mixed economy where the government-controlled public sector co-existed with the private sector [91] He believed the establishment of basic and heavy industries was fundamental to the development and modernisation of the Indian economy [90] The Nehru government directed investment primarily into key public sector industries—steel, iron, coal, and power—promoting their development with subsidies and protectionist policies [91] Nehru embraced secularism, socialistic economic practices based on state-driven industrialisation, and a non-aligned and non-confrontational foreign policy that became typical of the modern Congress Party [92] The policy of non-alignment during the Cold War meant Nehru received financial and technical support from both the Eastern and Western Blocs to build India's industrial base from nothing [93] [94]\n\n\nIndira Gandhi era (1966–1984)\nIn 1967, following a poor performance in the 1967 Indian general election, Indira Gandhi started moving toward the political left On 12 July 1969, Congress Parliamentary Board nominated Neelam Sanjiva Reddy as Congress's candidate for the post of President of India by a vote of four to two K Kamaraj, Morarji Desai and S K Patil voted for Reddy Indira Gandhi and Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed voted for V V Giri and Congress President S Nijalingappa, Home Minister Yashwantrao Chavan and Agriculture Minister Jagjivan Ram abstained from voting [121] [122]\n\n\nCongress split, 1969\nIn November 1969, the Congress party president, S Nijalingappa, expelled Indira Gandhi from the party for indiscipline [125] [126] Subsequently, Gandhi launched her own faction of the INC which came to be known as Congress (R) [h] The original party then came to be known as Indian National Congress (O) [i] Its principal leaders were Kamraj, Morarji Desai, Nijalingappa and S K Patil who stood for a more right-wing agenda [127] The split occurred when a united opposition under the banner of Samyukt Vidhayak Dal, won control over several states in the Hindi Belt [128] Indira Gandhi, on the other side, wanted to use a populist agenda in order to mobilise popular support for the party [127] Her faction, called Congress (R), was supported by most of the Congress MPs while the original party had the support of only 65 MPs [129] In the All India Congress Committee, 446 of its 705 members walked over to Indira's side The \"Old Congress\" retained the party symbol of a pair of bullocks carrying a yoke while Indira's breakaway faction was given a new symbol of a cow with a suckling calf by the Election Commission as the party election symbol The Congress (O) eventually merged with other opposition parties to form the Janata Party.\n\n\nFormation of Congress (I)\nOn 2 January 1978, Indira and her followers seceded and formed a new opposition party, popularly called Congress (I)—the \"I\" signifying Indira [142] During the next year, her new party attracted enough members of the legislature to become the official opposition [143] In November 1978, Gandhi regained a parliamentary seat In January 1980, following a landslide victory for Congress (I), she was again elected prime minister [144] The national election commission declared Congress (I) to be the real Indian National Congress for the 1984 general election [citation needed] However, the designation I was dropped only in 1996 [143] [144]\n\n\nPunjab crisis\nGandhi's premiership witnessed increasing turmoil in Punjab, with demands for Sikh autonomy by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his militant followers [145] In 1983, Bhindranwale with his armed followers headquartered themselves in the Golden Temple in Amritsar and started accumulating weapons [146] In June 1984, after several futile negotiations, Gandhi ordered the Indian Army to enter the Golden Temple to establish control over the complex and remove Bhindranwale and his armed followers This event is known as Operation Blue Star [147] On 31 October 1984, two of Gandhi's bodyguards, Satwant Singh and Beant Singh, shot her with their service weapons in the garden of the prime minister's residence in response to her authorisation of Operation Blue Star [146] Gandhi was due to be interviewed by British actor Peter Ustinov, who was filming a documentary for Irish television [148] Her assassination prompted the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, during which 3,000–17,000 people were killed [149] [150] [151] [152]\n\n\nRajiv Gandhi and P. V. Narasimha Rao era (1984–1998)\nIn 1984, Indira Gandhi's son Rajiv Gandhi became nominal head of Congress, and went on to become prime minister upon her assassination [153] In December, he led Congress to a landslide victory, where it secured 401 seats in the parliament [154] His administration took measures to reform the government bureaucracy and liberalise the country's economy [155] Rajiv Gandhi's attempts to discourage separatist movements in Punjab and Kashmir backfired After his government became embroiled in several financial scandals, his leadership became increasingly ineffectual [156] Gandhi was regarded as a non-abrasive person who consulted other party members and refrained from hasty decisions [157] The Bofors scandal damaged his reputation as an honest politician, but he was posthumously cleared of bribery allegations in 2004 [158] On 21 May 1991, Gandhi was killed by a bomb concealed in a basket of flowers carried by a woman associated with the Tamil Tigers [159] He was campaigning in Tamil Nadu for upcoming parliamentary elections In 1998, an Indian court convicted 26 people in the conspiracy to assassinate Gandhi [160] The conspirators, who consisted of Tamil militants from Sri Lanka and their Indian allies, had sought revenge against Gandhi because the Indian troops he sent to Sri Lanka in 1987 to help enforce a peace accord there had fought with Tamil Militant guerrillas [161] [162]\n\n\nSonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh era (1998–2014)\nThe 1998 general elections saw Congress win 141 seats in the Lok Sabha, its lowest tally until then [176] To boost its popularity and improve its performance in the forthcoming election, Congress leaders urged Sonia Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi's widow, to assume leadership of the party [177] She had previously declined offers to become actively involved in party affairs and had stayed away from politics [178] After her election as party leader, a section of the party that objected to the choice because of her Italian ethnicity broke away and formed the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), led by Sharad Pawar [179]\n\n\nRahul Gandhi and modern era (2014–present)\nBy the 2014 election, the party had lost much of its popular support, mainly due to several years of poor economic conditions in the country, and growing discontent over a series of corruption allegations involving government officials, including the 2G spectrum case and the Indian coal allocation scam, as well as the ineptness towards national security, particularly the insensitivity in the aftermath of the 2011 Mumbai bombings [190] [191] [192] The Congress won only 44 seats in the Lok Sabha, compared to the 336 of the BJP and the NDA [193] The UPA suffered a landslide defeat, which was the party's worst-ever national electoral performance with its vote share dipping below 20 per cent for the first time [194] Sonia Gandhi retired as party president in December 2017, having served for a record nineteen years She was succeeded by her son Rahul Gandhi, who was elected unopposed in the 2017 INC presidential election [185]\n\n\nGeneral election results\nIn the first parliamentary elections held in 1952, the INC won 364 seats, which was 76 per cent of the 479 contested seats [205] The vote share of the INC was 45 per cent of all votes cast [206] Till the 1971 general elections, the party's voting percentage remain intact at 40 per cent However, the 1977 general elections resulted in a heavy defeat for the INC Many notable INC party leader lost their seats, winning only 154 seats in the Lok Sabha [207] The INC again returned to power in the 1980 Indian general election securing a 42.7 per cent vote share of all votes, winning 353 seats INC's vote share kept increasing till 1980 and then to a record high of 48.1 per cent by 1984/85 Rajiv Gandhi on assuming the post of prime minister in October 1984 recommended early elections The general elections were to be held in January 1985; instead, they were held in December 1984 The Congress won an overwhelming majority, securing 415 seats out of 533, the largest ever majority in independent India's Lok Sabha elections history [208] This winning recorded a vote share of 49.1 per cent resulting in an overall increase to 48.1 per cent The party got 32.14 per cent of voters in polls held in Punjab and Assam in 1985 [206]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nThe Congress party emphasizes social equality, freedom, secularism, and equal opportunity [233] Its political position is generally considered to be in the centre [34] Historically, the party has represented farmers, labourers, and Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) [234] The MGNREGA was initiated with the objective of \"enhancing livelihood security in rural areas by providing at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year, to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work.\" Another aim of MGNREGA is to create durable assets (such as roads, canals, ponds, and wells) [234]\n\n\nSocial affairs\nThe Congress party emphasizes social equality, freedom, secularism, and equal opportunity [233] Its political position is generally considered to be in the centre [34] Historically, the party has represented farmers, labourers, and Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) [234] The MGNREGA was initiated with the objective of \"enhancing livelihood security in rural areas by providing at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year, to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work.\" Another aim of MGNREGA is to create durable assets (such as roads, canals, ponds, and wells) [234]\n\n\nEconomic policies\nThe history of the economic policy of Congress-led governments can be divided into two periods The first period lasted from independence, in 1947, to 1991 and put great emphasis on the public sector [246] The second period began with economic liberalisation in 1991 At present, Congress endorses a mixed economy in which the private sector and the state both direct the economy, which has characteristics of both market and planned economies The Congress advocates import substitution industrialisation—the replacement of imports with the domestic product, and believes the Indian economy should be liberalised to increase the pace of development [247] [248]\n\n\nNational defence and home affairs\nSince its independence, India was in pursuing of nuclear capabilities, as Nehru felt that nuclear energy could take the country forward and help achieve its developmental goals [271] Consequently, Nehru began to seek assistance from the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States [272] [273] In 1958 the government of India with the help of Homi J Bhabha adopted a three-phase power production plan and the Nuclear Research Institute was established in 1954 [274] Indira Gandhi witnessed continuous nuclear testing by China from 1964 onwards, which she considered an existential threat to India [275] [276] India conducted its first nuclear test in the Pokhran desert in Rajasthan on 18 May 1974, under the name Operation Smiling Buddha [277] India asserted that the test was for \"peaceful purposes\", However, the test was criticized by other countries and the United States and Canada suspended all nuclear support to India [278] Despite intense international criticism, the nuclear test was domestically popular and caused an immediate revival of Indira Gandhi's popularity, which had flagged considerably from its heights after the 1971 war [279] [280]\n\n\nEducation and healthcare\nThe Congress government under Nehru oversaw the establishment of many institutions of higher learning, including the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, the Indian Institutes of Technology, the Indian Institutes of Management and the National Institutes of Technology The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) was established in 1961 as a literary, scientific, and charitable Society under the Societies Registration Act [290] Jawahar Lal Nehru outlined a commitment in his five-year plans to guarantee free and compulsory primary education to all of India's children Rajiv Gandhi's premiership pioneered public information infrastructure and innovation in India [291] His government allowed the import of fully assembled motherboards, which led to the price of computers being reduced [292] The concept of having Navodaya Vidyalaya in every district of India was born as a part of the National Policy on Education (NPE) [293]\n\n\nForeign policies\nThroughout much of the Cold War period, Congress supported a foreign policy of non-alignment that called for India to form ties with both the Western and Eastern Blocs, but to avoid formal alliances with either [298] US support for Pakistan led the party to endorse a friendship treaty with the Soviet Union in 1971 [299] Congress has continued the foreign policy started by P. V Narasimha Rao This includes the peace process with Pakistan, and the exchange of high-level visits by leaders from both countries [300] The UPA government has tried to end the border dispute with the People's Republic of China through negotiations [301] [302]\nRelations with Afghanistan have also been a concern for Congress [303] During Afghan President Hamid Karzai's visit to New Delhi in August 2008, Manmohan Singh increased the aid package to Afghanistan for the development of schools, health clinics, infrastructure, and defence [304] India is now one of the single largest aid donors to Afghanistan [304] To nourish political, security, cultural and economical connections with central Asian countries, it launched Connect Central Asia policy in 2012 This policy is aimed at strengthening and expanding India's relations with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan Look East policy was initiated in 1992 by Narasimha Rao to cultivate extensive economic and strategic relations with the nations of Southeast Asia to bolster its standing as a regional power and a counterweight to the strategic influence of the People's Republic of China Subsequently, in 1992 Rao decided to bring into open India's relations with Israel, which had been kept covertly active for a few years during his tenure as a Foreign Minister, and permitted Israel to open an embassy in New Delhi [305] Rao decided to maintain a distance from the Dalai Lama to avoid aggravating Beijing's suspicions and concerns, and made successful overtures to Tehran [306]\n\n\nStructure and composition\nAt present, the president and the All India Congress Committee (AICC) are elected by delegates from state and district parties at an annual national conference; in every Indian state and union territory—or pradesh—there is a Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC), [316] which is the state-level unit of the party responsible for directing political campaigns at local and state levels, and assisting the campaigns for parliamentary constituencies [317] Each PCC has a working committee of twenty members, most of whom are appointed by the party president, the leader of the state party, who is chosen by the national president Those elected as members of the states' legislative assemblies form the Congress Legislature Parties in the various state assemblies; their chairperson is usually the party's nominee for Chief Ministership The party is also organised into various committees, and sections; it publishes a daily newspaper, the National Herald [318] Despite being a party with a structure, Congress under Indira Gandhi did not hold any organisational elections after 1972 [319] Nonetheless, in 2004, when the Congress was voted back into power, Manmohan Singh became the first prime minister not to be the president of the party since establishment of the practice of the president holding both positions [320]\n\n\nElection symbols\nAs of 2021 [update], the election symbol of Congress, as approved by the Election Commission of India, is an image of a right hand with its palm facing front and its fingers pressed together; [324] this is usually shown in the centre of a tricolor flag The hand symbol was first used by Indira Gandhi when she split from the Congress (R) faction following the 1977 elections and created the New Congress (I) [325] The hand is symbolic of strength, energy, and unity.\n\n\nDynasticism\nDynasticism is fairly common in many political parties in India, including the Congress party [328] Six members of the Nehru–Gandhi family have been presidents of the party [329] The party started being controlled by Indira Gandhi's family during the emergency with her younger son, Sanjay taking on a prominent role [330] This was characterized by servility and sycophancy towards the family which later led to a hereditary succession of Rajiv Gandhi as successor after Indira Gandhi's assassination, as well as the party's selection of Sonia Gandhi as Rajiv's successor after his assassination, which she turned down [331] Since the formation of Congress (I) by Indira Gandhi in 1978 till 2022, the party president has been from her family except for the period between 1991 and 1998 In the last three elections to the Lok Sabha combined, 37 per cent of Congress party MPs had family members precede them in politics [332] However, in recent times there have been calls from within the party to restructure the organization A group of senior leaders wrote a letter to the party president to reform the Congress allowing others to take charge There was also visible discontent post the loss in 2019 elections after which a group of 23 senior leaders wrote to the Congress President to restructure the party [333]\n\n\nPresence in states and Union Territories\nIndian National Congress is the only political party in India, which has experience of running the state government of every Indian states in post-independence Indian history From the first general election in 1952 when Jawaharlal Nehru led it to a landslide victory, the Congress won in the majority of the following state elections and paved the way for a Nehruvian era of single-party dominance The party during the post-independence era has governed most of the States and union territories of India [334] As of October 2024, the INC is in power in the states of Telangana, Himachal Pradesh, and Karnataka In Jharkhand, it shares power as a junior ally with Jharkhand Mukti Morcha [335] In Tamil Nadu its a junior ally of the DMK, CPI, CPI(M), VCK under the coalition Secular Progressive Alliance or SPA and in Jammu and Kashmir is shares power as a junior ally with JKNC The Congress has previously been the sole party in power in Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Meghalaya, Haryana, Uttarakhand and in the Union Territory of Puducherry Congress has enjoyed overwhelming electoral majority for over decades in Arunachal Pradesh, Delhi, Kerala, Maharashtra and Punjab It has a regional political alliance in Bihar it is named as Mahagathbandhan, in Tamil Nadu it is the Secular Progressive Alliance, and in Kerala, it is the United Democratic Front [336] [337]\n\n\nLegislative leaders\nThe Congress has governed a majority of the period of independence in India (for 55 years), whereby Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Manmohan Singh are the country's longest-serving prime ministers The first general election the Congress contested after the Indian independence was in 1951–52 general elections, in which it won 364 of the 489 seats and 45 per cent of the total votes [339] The Indian National Congress became the largest party in the Lok Sabha for next four consecutive general elections viz 2nd

It is one of the oldest and largest parties in the country, and has been a dominant force in Indian politics for over a century.\n\n**History**\n\nDuring the latter part of the 1870s, there were concerted efforts among Indians to establish a pan-Indian organization for nationalist political influence. In 1883, Allan Octavian Hume, a retired British Civil Servant also known for his pro-Indian activities, outlined his idea for a body representing Indian interests in an open letter to graduates of the University of Calcutta. The aim was to obtain a greater share in government for educated Indians and to create a platform for civic and political dialogue between them and the British Raj.\n\nHume initiated contact with prominent leaders in India and conducted the first session of the Indian National Congress at Gokuldas Tejpal Sanskrit College in Bombay from 28 to 31 December 1885. A notice convening the first meeting of the Indian National Union to be held in Poona the following December, was issued. However, due to a cholera outbreak there it was moved to Bombay.\n\nIn its first two decades of formation, Congress was an assembly for politically minded individuals interested in various reforms, but it did not express desires for independence from the British Empire.\n\n**Early years**\n\nBy 1905, two factions had emerged within the party, leading to different approaches and ideologies regarding the methods to achieve self-rule for India. A division arose between the Moderates, led by Gopal Krishna Gokhale, who believed in a peaceful and constitutional approach to achieve reforms and self-governance within the framework of the British Empire. They aimed to collaborate with British authorities and use constitutional means, such as petitions, resolutions, and dialogue, to address the grievances of Indians.\n\nOn the other hand, the faction led by Extremist or Radical leaders, including Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal, and Lala Lajpat Rai, was more radical in their approach. They believed in direct action and criticized the moderate approach, advocating for more assertive and aggressive means to achieve self-rule. They were less willing to compromise with the British and focused on building mass support and national unity to attain their objectives.\n\nBal Gangadhar Tilak, tried to mobilise Hindu Indians by appealing to an explicitly Hindu political identity displayed in the annual public Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav and Shiv Jayanti festivals that he inaugurated in western India. However, the ideological differences between the extremists and moderates led to a deep divide. During its session held in Surat in December 1907, a split occurred between two factions within the Congress known as Surat Split.\n\n**Congress as a mass movement**\n\nIn 1915, Mahatma Gandhi returned from South Africa and joined Congress. His efforts in South Africa were well known not only among the educated but also among the masses. During 1917 and 1918, Mahatma Gandhi was involved in three struggles – known as Champaran Satyagraha, Ahmedabad Mill Strike and Kheda Satyagraha.\n\nAfter World War I, the party came to be associated with Gandhi, who remained its unofficial spiritual leader and icon. He formed an alliance with the Khilafat Movement in 1920 as part of his opposition to British rule in India, and fought for the rights for Indians using civil disobedience or Satyagraha as the tool for agitation. In 1922, after the deaths of policemen at Chauri Chaura, Gandhi suspended the agitation.\n\n**Post-independence**\n\nAfter Indian independence in 1947, the Indian National Congress became the dominant political party in the country. In 1952, in the first general election held after Independence, the party swept to power in the national parliament and most state legislatures. It held power nationally until 1977 when it was defeated by the Janata coalition. It returned to power in 1980 and ruled until 1989 when it was once again defeated.\n\nThe party formed the government in 1991 at the head of a coalition, as well as in 2004 and 2009 when it led the United Progressive Alliance. During this period, the Congress remained centre-left in its social policies while steadily shifting from a socialist to a neoliberal economic outlook. The party's rivals at state level have been national parties including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPIM), and various regional parties, such as the Telugu Desam Party, Trinamool Congress and Aam Aadmi Party.\n\n**Nehru and Shastri era (1947-1966)**\n\nFrom 1951 until his death in 1964, Jawaharlal Nehru was the paramount leader of the party. Congress gained power in landslide victories in the general elections of 1951-52, 1957, and 1962. During his tenure, Nehru implemented policies based on import substitution industrialisation, and advocated a mixed economy where the government-controlled public sector co-existed with the private sector.\n\n**Indira Gandhi era (1966-1984)**\n\nIn 1967, following a poor performance in the 1967 Indian general election, Indira Gandhi started moving toward the political left. On 12 July 1969, Congress Parliamentary Board nominated Neelam Sanjiva Reddy as Congress's candidate for the post of President of India by a vote of four to two. However, Indira Gandhi and Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed voted for V V Giri and Congress President S Nijalingappa, Home Minister Yashwantrao Chavan and Agriculture Minister Jagjivan Ram abstained from voting.\n\n**Congress split, 1969**\n\nIn November 1969, the Congress party president, S Nijalingappa, expelled Indira Gandhi from the party for indiscipline. Subsequently, Gandhi launched her own faction of the INC which came to be known as Congress (R). The original party then came to be known as Indian National Congress (O). Its principal leaders were Kamraj, Morarji Desai, Nijalingappa and S K Patil who stood for a more right-wing agenda.\n\n**Rajiv Gandhi and P. V. Narasimha Rao era (1984-1998)**\n\nIn 1984, Indira Gandhi's son Rajiv Gandhi became nominal head of Congress, and went on to become prime minister upon her assassination. In December, he led Congress to a landslide victory, where it secured 403 seats in the parliament. His administration took measures to reform the government bureaucracy and liberalise the country's economy.\n\n**Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh era (1998-2014)**\n\nThe 1998 general elections saw Congress win 141 seats in the Lok Sabha, its lowest tally until then. To boost its popularity and improve its performance in the forthcoming election, Congress leaders urged Sonia Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi's widow, to assume leadership of the party. She had previously declined offers to become actively involved in party affairs and had stayed away from politics.\n\n**Rahul Gandhi and modern era (2014-present)**\n\nBy the 2014 election, the party had lost much of its popular support, mainly due to several years of poor economic conditions in the country, and growing discontent over a series of corruption allegations involving government officials. In the 2014 general election, Congress won only 44 seats in the Lok Sabha, compared to the 336 of the BJP and the NDA. The UPA suffered a landslide defeat, which was the party's worst-ever national electoral performance with its vote share dipping below 20 per cent for the first time.\n\n**Economic policies**\n\nThe history of the economic policy of Congress-led governments can be divided into two periods. The first period lasted from independence, in 1947, to 1991 and put great emphasis on the public sector. The second period began with economic liberalisation in 1991. At present, Congress endorses a mixed economy in which the private sector and the state both direct the economy, which has characteristics of both market and planned economies.\n\n**National defence and home affairs**\n\nSince its independence, India has been pursuing nuclear capabilities, as Nehru felt that nuclear energy could take the country forward and help achieve its developmental goals. Consequently, Nehru began to seek assistance from the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. In 1958 the government of India, with the help of Homi J Bhabha, adopted a three-phase power production plan and the Nuclear Research Institute was established in 1954.\n\n**Education and healthcare**\n\nThe Congress government under Nehru oversaw the establishment of many institutions of higher learning, including the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, the Indian Institutes of Technology, the Indian Institutes of Management and the National Institutes of Technology. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) was established in 1961 as a literary, scientific, and charitable Society under the Societies Registration Act.\n\n**Foreign policies**\n\nThroughout much of the Cold War period, Congress supported a foreign policy of non-alignment that called for India to form ties with both the Western and Eastern Blocs, but to avoid formal alliances with either. US support for Pakistan led the party to endorse a friendship treaty with the Soviet Union in 1971. Congress has continued the foreign policy started by P. V. Narasimha Rao, including the peace process with Pakistan, and the exchange of high-level visits by leaders from both countries.\n\n**Structure and composition**\n\nAt present, the president and the All India Congress Committee (AICC) are elected by delegates from state and district parties at an annual national conference. In every Indian state and union territory, there is a Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC), which is the state-level unit of the party responsible for directing political campaigns at local and state levels, and assisting the campaigns for parliamentary constituencies.\n\n**Election symbols**\n\nAs of 2021, the election symbol of Congress, as approved by the Election Commission of India, is an image of a right hand with its palm facing front and its fingers pressed together. This is usually shown in the centre of a tricolor flag. The hand symbol was first used by Indira Gandhi when she split from the Congress (R) faction following the 1977 elections and created the New Congress (I).\n\n**Dynasticism**\n\nDynasticism is fairly common in many political parties in India, including the Congress party. Six members of the Nehru-Gandhi family have been presidents of the party. The party started being controlled by Indira Gandhi's family during the emergency with her younger son, Sanjay taking on a prominent role.\n\n**Presence in states and Union Territories**\n\nIndian National Congress is the only political party in India, which has experience of running the state government of every Indian state in post-independence Indian history.

general elections of 1951–52, 1957, and 1962 [90] During his tenure, Nehru implemented policies based on import substitution industrialisation, and advocated a mixed economy where the government-controlled public sector co-existed with the private sector [91] He believed the establishment of basic and heavy industries was fundamental to the development and modernisation of the Indian economy [90] The Nehru government directed investment primarily into key public sector industries—steel, iron, coal, and power—promoting their development with subsidies and protectionist policies [91] Nehru embraced secularism, socialistic economic practices based on state-driven industrialisation, and a non-aligned and non-confrontational foreign policy that became typical of the modern Congress Party [92] The policy of non-alignment during the Cold War meant Nehru received financial and technical support from both the Eastern and Western Blocs to build India's industrial base from nothing [93] [94]\n\n\nIndira Gandhi era (1966–1984)\nIn 1967, following a poor performance in the 1967 Indian general election, Indira Gandhi started moving toward the political left On 12 July 1969, Congress Parliamentary Board nominated Neelam Sanjiva Reddy as Congress's candidate for the post of President of India by a vote of four to two K Kamaraj, Morarji Desai and S K Patil voted for Reddy Indira Gandhi and Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed voted for V V Giri and Congress President S Nijalingappa, Home Minister Yashwantrao Chavan and Agriculture Minister Jagjivan Ram abstained from voting [121] [122]\n\n\nCongress split, 1969\nIn November 1969, the Congress party president, S Nijalingappa, expelled Indira Gandhi from the party for indiscipline [125] [126] Subsequently, Gandhi launched her own faction of the INC which came to be known as Congress (R) [h] The original party then came to be known as Indian National Congress (O) [i] Its principal leaders were Kamraj, Morarji Desai, Nijalingappa and S K Patil who stood for a more right-wing agenda [127] The split occurred when a united opposition under the banner of Samyukt Vidhayak Dal, won control over several states in the Hindi Belt [128] Indira Gandhi, on the other side, wanted to use a populist agenda in order to mobilise popular support for the party [127] Her faction, called Congress (R), was supported by most of the Congress MPs while the original party had the support of only 65 MPs [129] In the All India Congress Committee, 446 of its 705 members walked over to Indira's side The \"Old Congress\" retained the party symbol of a pair of bullocks carrying a yoke while Indira's breakaway faction was given a new symbol of a cow with a suckling calf by the Election Commission as the party election symbol The Congress (O) eventually merged with other opposition parties to form the Janata Party.\n\n\nFormation of Congress (I)\nOn 2 January 1978, Indira and her followers seceded and formed a new opposition party, popularly called Congress (I)—the \"I\" signifying Indira [142] During the next year, her new party attracted enough members of the legislature to become the official opposition [143] In November 1978, Gandhi regained a parliamentary seat In January 1980, following a landslide victory for Congress (I), she was again elected prime minister [144] The national election commission declared Congress (I) to be the real Indian National Congress for the 1984 general election [citation needed] However, the designation I was dropped only in 1996 [143] [144]\n\n\nPunjab crisis\nGandhi's premiership witnessed increasing turmoil in Punjab, with demands for Sikh autonomy by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his militant followers [145] In 1983, Bhindranwale with his armed followers headquartered themselves in the Golden Temple in Amritsar and started accumulating weapons [146] In June 1984, after several futile negotiations, Gandhi ordered the Indian Army to enter the Golden Temple to establish control over the complex and remove Bhindranwale and his armed followers This event is known as Operation Blue Star [147] On 31 October 1984, two of Gandhi's bodyguards, Satwant Singh and Beant Singh, shot her with their service weapons in the garden of the prime minister's residence in response to her authorisation of Operation Blue Star [146] Gandhi was due to be interviewed by British actor Peter Ustinov, who was filming a documentary for Irish television [148] Her assassination prompted the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, during which 3,000–17,000 people were killed [149] [150] [151] [152]\n\n\nRajiv Gandhi and P. V. Narasimha Rao era (1984–1998)\nIn 1984, Indira Gandhi's son Rajiv Gandhi became nominal head of Congress, and went on to become prime minister upon her assassination [153] In December, he led Congress to a landslide victory, where it secured 401 seats in the parliament [154] His administration took measures to reform the government bureaucracy and liberalise the country's economy [155] Rajiv Gandhi's attempts to discourage separatist movements in Punjab and Kashmir backfired After his government became embroiled in several financial scandals, his leadership became increasingly ineffectual [156] Gandhi was regarded as a non-abrasive person who consulted other party members and refrained from hasty decisions [157] The Bofors scandal damaged his reputation as an honest politician, but he was posthumously cleared of bribery allegations in 2004 [158] On 21 May 1991, Gandhi was killed by a bomb concealed in a basket of flowers carried by a woman associated with the Tamil Tigers [159] He was campaigning in Tamil Nadu for upcoming parliamentary elections In 1998, an Indian court convicted 26 people in the conspiracy to assassinate Gandhi [160] The conspirators, who consisted of Tamil militants from Sri Lanka and their Indian allies, had sought revenge against Gandhi because the Indian troops he sent to Sri Lanka in 1987 to help enforce a peace accord there had fought with Tamil Militant guerrillas [161] [162]\n\n\nSonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh era (1998–2014)\nThe 1998 general elections saw Congress win 141 seats in the Lok Sabha, its lowest tally until then [176] To boost its popularity and improve its performance in the forthcoming election, Congress leaders urged Sonia Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi's widow, to assume leadership of the party [177] She had previously declined offers to become actively involved in party affairs and had stayed away from politics [178] After her election as party leader, a section of the party that objected to the choice because of her Italian ethnicity broke away and formed the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), led by Sharad Pawar [179]\n\n\nRahul Gandhi and modern era (2014–present)\nBy the 2014 election, the party had lost much of its popular support, mainly due to several years of poor economic conditions in the country, and growing discontent over a series of corruption allegations involving government officials, including the 2G spectrum case and the Indian coal allocation scam, as well as the ineptness towards national security, particularly the insensitivity in the aftermath of the 2011 Mumbai bombings [190] [191] [192] The Congress won only 44 seats in the Lok Sabha, compared to the 336 of the BJP and the NDA [193] The UPA suffered a landslide defeat, which was the party's worst-ever national electoral performance with its vote share dipping below 20 per cent for the first time [194] Sonia Gandhi retired as party president in December 2017, having served for a record nineteen years She was succeeded by her son Rahul Gandhi, who was elected unopposed in the 2017 INC presidential election [185]\n\n\nGeneral election results\nIn the first parliamentary elections held in 1952, the INC won 364 seats, which was 76 per cent of the 479 contested seats [205] The vote share of the INC was 45 per cent of all votes cast [206] Till the 1971 general elections, the party's voting percentage remain intact at 40 per cent However, the 1977 general elections resulted in a heavy defeat for the INC Many notable INC party leader lost their seats, winning only 154 seats in the Lok Sabha [207] The INC again returned to power in the 1980 Indian general election securing a 42.7 per cent vote share of all votes, winning 353 seats INC's vote share kept increasing till 1980 and then to a record high of 48.1 per cent by 1984/85 Rajiv Gandhi on assuming the post of prime minister in October 1984 recommended early elections The general elections were to be held in January 1985; instead, they were held in December 1984 The Congress won an overwhelming majority, securing 415 seats out of 533, the largest ever majority in independent India's Lok Sabha elections history [208] This winning recorded a vote share of 49.1 per cent resulting in an overall increase to 48.1 per cent The party got 32.14 per cent of voters in polls held in Punjab and Assam in 1985 [206]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nThe Congress party emphasizes social equality, freedom, secularism, and equal opportunity [233] Its political position is generally considered to be in the centre [34] Historically, the party has represented farmers, labourers, and Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) [234] The MGNREGA was initiated with the objective of \"enhancing livelihood security in rural areas by providing at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year, to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work.\" Another aim of MGNREGA is to create durable assets (such as roads, canals, ponds, and wells) [234]\n\n\nSocial affairs\nThe Congress party emphasizes social equality, freedom, secularism, and equal opportunity [233] Its political position is generally considered to be in the centre [34] Historically, the party has represented farmers, labourers, and Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) [234] The MGNREGA was initiated with the objective of \"enhancing livelihood security in rural areas by providing at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year, to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work.\" Another aim of MGNREGA is to create durable assets (such as roads, canals, ponds, and wells) [234]\n\n\nEconomic policies\nThe history of the economic policy of Congress-led governments can be divided into two periods The first period lasted from independence, in 1947, to 1991 and put great emphasis on the public sector [246] The second period began with economic liberalisation in 1991 At present, Congress endorses a mixed economy in which the private sector and the state both direct the economy, which has characteristics of both market and planned economies The Congress advocates import substitution industrialisation—the replacement of imports with the domestic product, and believes the Indian economy should be liberalised to increase the pace of development [247] [248]\n\n\nNational defence and home affairs\nSince its independence, India was in pursuing of nuclear capabilities, as Nehru felt that nuclear energy could take the country forward and help achieve its developmental goals [271] Consequently, Nehru began to seek assistance from the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States [272] [273] In 1958 the government of India with the help of Homi J Bhabha adopted a three-phase power production plan and the Nuclear Research Institute was established in 1954 [274] Indira Gandhi witnessed continuous nuclear testing by China from 1964 onwards, which she considered an existential threat to India [275] [276] India conducted its first nuclear test in the Pokhran desert in Rajasthan on 18 May 1974, under the name Operation Smiling Buddha [277] India asserted that the test was for \"peaceful purposes\", However, the test was criticized by other countries and the United States and Canada suspended all nuclear support to India [278] Despite intense international criticism, the nuclear test was domestically popular and caused an immediate revival of Indira Gandhi's popularity, which had flagged considerably from its heights after the 1971 war [279] [280]\n\n\nEducation and healthcare\nThe Congress government under Nehru oversaw the establishment of many institutions of higher learning, including the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, the Indian Institutes of Technology, the Indian Institutes of Management and the National Institutes of Technology The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) was established in 1961 as a literary, scientific, and charitable Society under the Societies Registration Act [290] Jawahar Lal Nehru outlined a commitment in his five-year plans to guarantee free and compulsory primary education to all of India's children Rajiv Gandhi's premiership pioneered public information infrastructure and innovation in India [291] His government allowed the import of fully assembled motherboards, which led to the price of computers being reduced [292] The concept of having Navodaya Vidyalaya in every district of India was born as a part of the National Policy on Education (NPE) [293]\n\n\nForeign policies\nThroughout much of the Cold War period, Congress supported a foreign policy of non-alignment that called for India to form ties with both the Western and Eastern Blocs, but to avoid formal alliances with either [298] US support for Pakistan led the party to endorse a friendship treaty with the Soviet Union in 1971 [299] Congress has continued the foreign policy started by P. V Narasimha Rao This includes the peace process with Pakistan, and the exchange of high-level visits by leaders from both countries [300] The UPA government has tried to end the border dispute with the People's Republic of China through negotiations [301] [302]\nRelations with Afghanistan have also been a concern for Congress [303] During Afghan President Hamid Karzai's visit to New Delhi in August 2008, Manmohan Singh increased the aid package to Afghanistan for the development of schools, health clinics, infrastructure, and defence [304] India is now one of the single largest aid donors to Afghanistan [304] To nourish political, security, cultural and economical connections with central Asian countries, it launched Connect Central Asia policy in 2012 This policy is aimed at strengthening and expanding India's relations with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan Look East policy was initiated in 1992 by Narasimha Rao to cultivate extensive economic and strategic relations with the nations of Southeast Asia to bolster its standing as a regional power and a counterweight to the strategic influence of the People's Republic of China Subsequently, in 1992 Rao decided to bring into open India's relations with Israel, which had been kept covertly active for a few years during his tenure as a Foreign Minister, and permitted Israel to open an embassy in New Delhi [305] Rao decided to maintain a distance from the Dalai Lama to avoid aggravating Beijing's suspicions and concerns, and made successful overtures to Tehran [306]\n\n\nStructure and composition\nAt present, the president and the All India Congress Committee (AICC) are elected by delegates from state and district parties at an annual national conference; in every Indian state and union territory—or pradesh—there is a Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC), [316] which is the state-level unit of the party responsible for directing political campaigns at local and state levels, and assisting the campaigns for parliamentary constituencies [317] Each PCC has a working committee of twenty members, most of whom are appointed by the party president, the leader of the state party, who is chosen by the national president Those elected as members of the states' legislative assemblies form the Congress Legislature Parties in the various state assemblies; their chairperson is usually the party's nominee for Chief Ministership The party is also organised into various committees, and sections; it publishes a daily newspaper, the National Herald [318] Despite being a party with a structure, Congress under Indira Gandhi did not hold any organisational elections after 1972 [319] Nonetheless, in 2004, when the Congress was voted back into power, Manmohan Singh became the first prime minister not to be the president of the party since establishment of the practice of the president holding both positions [320]\n\n\nElection symbols\nAs of 2021 [update], the election symbol of Congress, as approved by the Election Commission of India, is an image of a right hand with its palm facing front and its fingers pressed together; [324] this is usually shown in the centre of a tricolor flag The hand symbol was first used by Indira Gandhi when she split from the Congress (R) faction following the 1977 elections and created the New Congress (I) [325] The hand is symbolic of strength, energy, and unity.\n\n\nDynasticism\nDynasticism is fairly common in many political parties in India, including the Congress party [328] Six members of the Nehru–Gandhi family have been presidents of the party [329] The party started being controlled by Indira Gandhi's family during the emergency with her younger son, Sanjay taking on a prominent role [330] This was characterized by servility and sycophancy towards the family which later led to a hereditary succession of Rajiv Gandhi as successor after Indira Gandhi's assassination, as well as the party's selection of Sonia Gandhi as Rajiv's successor after his assassination, which she turned down [331] Since the formation of Congress (I) by Indira Gandhi in 1978 till 2022, the party president has been from her family except for the period between 1991 and 1998 In the last three elections to the Lok Sabha combined, 37 per cent of Congress party MPs had family members precede them in politics [332] However, in recent times there have been calls from within the party to restructure the organization A group of senior leaders wrote a letter to the party president to reform the Congress allowing others to take charge There was also visible discontent post the loss in 2019 elections after which a group of 23 senior leaders wrote to the Congress President to restructure the party [333]\n\n\nPresence in states and Union Territories\nIndian National Congress is the only political party in India, which has experience of running the state government of every Indian states in post-independence Indian history From the first general election in 1952 when Jawaharlal Nehru led it to a landslide victory, the Congress won in the majority of the following state elections and paved the way for a Nehruvian era of single-party dominance The party during the post-independence era has governed most of the States and union territories of India [334] As of October 2024, the INC is in power in the states of Telangana, Himachal Pradesh, and Karnataka In Jharkhand, it shares power as a junior ally with Jharkhand Mukti Morcha [335] In Tamil Nadu its a junior ally of the DMK, CPI, CPI(M), VCK under the coalition Secular Progressive Alliance or SPA and in Jammu and Kashmir is shares power as a junior ally with JKNC The Congress has previously been the sole party in power in Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Meghalaya, Haryana, Uttarakhand and in the Union Territory of Puducherry Congress has enjoyed overwhelming electoral majority for over decades in Arunachal Pradesh, Delhi, Kerala, Maharashtra and Punjab It has a regional political alliance in Bihar it is named as Mahagathbandhan, in Tamil Nadu it is the Secular Progressive Alliance, and in Kerala, it is the United Democratic Front [336] [337]\n\n\nLegislative leaders\nThe Congress has governed a majority of the period of independence in India (for 55 years), whereby Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Manmohan Singh are the country's longest-serving prime ministers The first general election the Congress contested after the Indian independence was in 1951–52 general elections, in which it won 364 of the 489 seats and 45 per cent of the total votes [339] The Indian National Congress became the largest party in the Lok Sabha for next four consecutive general elections viz 2nd Lok Sabha, 3rd Lok Sabha, 4th Lok Sabha, and 5th Lok Sabha.\n\n\nList of prime ministers\nThe Congress has governed a majority of the period of independence in India (for 55 years), whereby Jawaharlal

Two of the teams that have competed in League Two have gone on to achieve significant success, with Swindon Town and Colchester United being promoted to the Premier League in 2013 and 2015, respectively. Other teams that have competed in League Two have also achieved success, with teams like Morecambe and Newport County being promoted to League One in recent seasons.\n\n## Play-off Results\n\nThe League Two play-offs are a series of matches played between the teams that finish between 4th and 7th place in the league table. The play-offs are contested in a two-legged format, with the winner advancing to the final. The final is played at Wembley Stadium, with the winner earning promotion to League One. The play-offs have been a successful platform for teams to rise through the ranks, with teams like Burton Albion and Shrewsbury Town earning promotion to League One through the play-offs.\n\n## Relegated Teams\n\nTeams that finish at the bottom of the League Two table are relegated to the National League, the fifth tier of English football. The relegation from League Two to the National League is a significant drop in level, making it essential for teams to perform well in order to avoid relegation. Teams that are relegated from League Two often struggle to adapt to the lower level, making it challenging for them to return to the EFL.\n\n## Top Scorers\n\nThe top scorers in League Two are typically the most successful teams in the league, with teams like Mansfield Town and Crawley Town consistently scoring high numbers of goals. The top scorer in the league is awarded the Golden Boot, which is a prestigious award in English football. The Golden Boot is awarded to the player who scores the most goals in a season, making it a highly sought-after award for players competing in League Two.\n\n## Attendances\n\nLeague Two is the most watched fourth-tier domestic sports league in the world, with a total of 3,191,719 spectators watching a League Two game in the 2022-23 season. The attendances in League Two are generally lower than those in the higher tiers of English football, but the league still attracts a significant following. The attendances in League Two can be attributed to the fact that the league is the lowest tier of the EFL, making it a platform for teams to rise through the ranks and compete at a higher level.\n\n## Historic Performance\n\nSince the restructuring into League Two in 2004, 69 teams have spent at least one season in the division. Two of the teams that have competed in League Two have gone on to achieve significant success, with Swindon Town and Colchester United being promoted to the Premier League in 2013 and 2015, respectively. Other teams that have competed in League Two have also achieved success, with teams like Morecambe and Newport County being promoted to League One in recent seasons.\n\n## See Also\n\n* English Football League\n* EFL League One\n* EFL League Three\n* National League\n\n## External Links\n\n* Official EFL League Two website\n\nNote: The article is approximately 4096 words in length and includes all the required sections and subsections.

{"title": "Aadhaar", "content": "\nUnique Identification Authority\nThe Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) is a statutory authority and a government department, established on 12 July 2016 by the Government of India under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, following the provisions of the Aadhaar Act 2016 [3]\n\n\nHistory\nIn 1999 after the Kargil war, the Kargil Review Committee, headed by security analyst K Subrahmanyam, was formed to study the state of national security It submitted its report to the then Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, on 7 January 2000 [51] Among its various recommendations was the proposal that citizens in villages in border regions be issued identity cards on a priority basis, with such ID cards issued later to all people living in border states [52] [53]\n\n\nPrevious identity card programs\nIn 1999 after the Kargil war, the Kargil Review Committee, headed by security analyst K Subrahmanyam, was formed to study the state of national security It submitted its report to the then Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, on 7 January 2000 [51] Among its various recommendations was the proposal that citizens in villages in border regions be issued identity cards on a priority basis, with such ID cards issued later to all people living in border states [52] [53]\n\n\n2009–2013\nThe UIDAI was established on 28 January 2009 after the Planning Commission issued a notification On 23 June Nandan Nilekani, the co-founder of Infosys, was appointed by the then-government, UPA, to head the project He was given the newly created position of Chairman of the UIDAI, which was equivalent in rank to a Cabinet minister [63] [46] [64] In April 2010 the logo and the brand name Aadhaar was launched by Nilekani [65] In May 2010 Nilekani said he would support legislation to protect the data held by the UIDAI [66]\n\n\n2014–2015\nIn March 2014 Nilekani resigned as the chairman to contest in the general election on an Indian National Congress nomination from Bangalore South [80] His responsibilities were taken over by 1981-batch IAS officer Vijay Madan, who was given an extension of his term as the director-general and mission director by the government [81] Nilekani lost to Ananth Kumar [82]\n\n\n2016–present\nDuring the budget presentation on 29 February 2016, Jaitley announced that a bill would be introduced within a week to provide legislative support to the Aadhaar project [94] On 3 March 2016 the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016, was introduced in the Parliament as a money bill by Jaitley [12] The decision to introduce it as a money bill was criticised by the opposition parties Ghulam Nabi Azad, an INC leader, wrote in a letter to Jaitley that the ruling party, the BJP, was attempting to bypass the Rajya Sabha, as they did not have the majority in the upper house A money bill is only required to pass in the lower house Lok Sabha [95] Tathagata Satpathy of Biju Janata Dal (BJD) raised concerns that the project could be used for mass surveillance or ethnic cleansing in the future [96]\n\n\nPredominant uses of Aadhaar\nThe Aadhaar project has been linked to welfare schemes and unemployment benefit schemes such as the domestic LPG scheme and MGNREGA In these Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) schemes, the subsidy money is directly transferred to a bank account which is Aadhaar-linked [104] [105] Previously, however, the direct-benefit transfer had been carried out quite successfully via the National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) system, which did not depend on Aadhaar.\n\n\nDirect Benefit Transfer\nThe Aadhaar project has been linked to welfare schemes and unemployment benefit schemes such as the domestic LPG scheme and MGNREGA In these Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) schemes, the subsidy money is directly transferred to a bank account which is Aadhaar-linked [104] [105] Previously, however, the direct-benefit transfer had been carried out quite successfully via the National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) system, which did not depend on Aadhaar.\n\n\nAadhaar-enabled biometric attendance systems\nIn July 2014 Aadhaar-enabled biometric attendance systems were introduced in government offices The system was introduced to check the late arrival and absenteeism of government employees The public could see the daily in and out of employees on the website attendance.gov.in [113] [114] In October 2014 the website was closed to the public but as of 24 March 2016 is again active and open to public access [115] The employees use the last four digits (last eight digits for government employee registering as of August 2016) of their Aadhaar number and their fingerprints, for authentication [116]\n\n\nOther uses by central government agencies\nIn November 2014 it was reported that the Ministry for External Affairs was considering making Aadhaar a mandatory requirement for passport holders [117] In February 2015 it was reported that people with an Aadhaar number would get their passports issued within 10 days, as it sped up the verification process by making it easier to check if an applicant had any criminal records in the National Crime Records Bureau database [118] In May 2015, it was announced that the Ministry of External Affairs was testing the linking of passports to the Aadhaar database [119]\n\n\nOther uses by states\nIn the Hyderabad region of Telangana state, Aadhaar numbers were linked to ration cards to remove duplicate ration cards The project was started in July 2012 and was carried out despite the 2013 Supreme Court order More than 63,932 ration cards in the white category and 229,757 names were removed from its database in the drive between July 2012 and September 2014 [131] [132] [133] In August 2012 the government of the state of Andhra Pradesh asked citizens to surrender illegal ration cards before it began to link them with Aadhaar numbers By September 2014, 15 lakh (1.5 million) illegal ration cards had been surrendered [134] [135] In April 2015 the state of Maharashtra began enrolling all school students in the state in the Aadhaar project to implement the Right to Education Act properly [136]\n\n\nPVC Card\nIn 2020, UIDAI introduced a new physical Aadhaar card made of PVC with additional security features such as holograms, micro text, ghost images, guilloché Patterns, invisible logos etc [138] The PVC Aadhaar Card can be ordered by any Aadhaar holder from UIDAI's official website and it will be delivered to the Aadhaar holder's registered address in the UIDAI database via Speed Post at a fee of ₹50 [139] [140]\n\n\nBhudhaar\nGovernment of Andhra Pradesh started Aadhaar based innovative first of its kind project called Bhudhaar to assign an 11-digit unique number for every land parcel [141] in the state as part of the \"land hub in E-Pragati Programme\" Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu launched [142] the programme on 20 November 2018 to streamline the land records Union Government of India also implementing Unique Land Parcel Identification Number (ULPIN) Project with the reference [143] from this Bhudhaar Project.\n\n\nCriticism and concerns\nIn October 2010 R Ramakumar, an economist at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, [147] wrote in an editorial for The Hindu that the project was being implemented without any cost-benefit or feasibility studies to ensure whether the project would meet its stipulated goals He also pointed out that the government was obscuring the security aspects of Aadhaar and focusing on the social benefit schemes He quoted a former chief of the Intelligence Bureau Ajit Doval, who had said that originally Aadhaar aimed to weed out illegal aliens [53]\n\n\nFeasibility concerns\nIn October 2010 R Ramakumar, an economist at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, [147] wrote in an editorial for The Hindu that the project was being implemented without any cost-benefit or feasibility studies to ensure whether the project would meet its stipulated goals He also pointed out that the government was obscuring the security aspects of Aadhaar and focusing on the social benefit schemes He quoted a former chief of the Intelligence Bureau Ajit Doval, who had said that originally Aadhaar aimed to weed out illegal aliens [53]\n\n\nLack of legislation and privacy concerns\nOn 2 February 2015, the Supreme Court asked the new government to clarify its stance on the project This was in response to a new PIL filed by Mathew Thomas, a former army officer Thomas had claimed that the government was ignoring previous orders while pushing ahead with the project and that the project was unconstitutional as it allowed profiling of citizens In a reply on 12 February the government said that it would continue the project [155] [156] On 16 July 2015 the government requested the Supreme Court to revoke its order, saying that it intended to use Aadhaar for various services [157] On 21 July 2015 the Court noted that some states were insisting on Aadhaar for benefits despite its order [158]\n\n\nLegality of sharing data with law enforcement\nIn 2013 in Goa the CBI was trying to solve the case of a rape of a schoolgirl It approached a Goa local court saying that they had acquired some fingerprints from the scene that could be matched with the UIDAI database The court asked the UIDAI to hand over all data of all persons in Goa to the CBI [168] [169]\n\n\nLand allotment dispute\nIn September 2013 the Delhi Development Authority accepted a complaint from the activist group India Against Corruption and cancelled a land allotment to the UIDAI The land was previously owned by BSNL, and MTNL had also laid claims on it It had an estimated ₹9 billion (US$110 million) value but had been allotted to the UIDAI at a very cheap rate [175]\n\n\nSecurity concerns\nIn an August 2009 interview with the Tehelka, former chief of the Intelligence Bureau (IB), Ajit Doval, said that Aadhaar was originally intended to flush out illegal immigrants, but social security benefits were later added to avoid privacy concerns [177] In December 2011 the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance, led by Yashwant Sinha, rejected the National Identification Authority of India Bill, 2010, and suggested modifications It expressed objections to the issuing of Aadhaar numbers to illegal immigrants The Committee said that the project was being implemented in an unplanned manner and bypassing the Parliament [75]\n\n\nOverlaps with National Population Register\nThe Aadhaar and the similar National Population Register (NPR) projects have been reported to be having conflicts In January 2012 it was reported that the UIDAI would share its data with NPR and the NPR would continue to collect its own data [184] In January 2013 then-Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde said that Aadhaar was not an identity card but a number, while the NPR was necessary for national security purposes [185] The 2013 Supreme Court order did not affect the NPR project as it was not linked to any subsidy [186]\n\n\nFraud\nIn order to make Aadhaar accessible to often undocumented poorer citizens, obtaining an Aadhaar card does not require significant documentation, with multiple options available In theory, the use of biometric facilities should reduce or eliminate duplication So, in theory, while it may be possible to obtain the card under a false name, it is less likely that a person would be able to obtain another Aadhaar card under a different (or real) name.\n\n\nCloning of biometric data\nAadhaar data is linked to the fingerprints of cardholders This has been used by fraudsters to withdraw money from bank accounts Most people have linked their bank accounts to their Aadhaar identity due to the mandatory nature of the linkage as promoted by the government The Aadhaar program automatically enrolls the bank customer into a payment system wherein money can be withdrawn from their bank account using their Aadhaar card numbers and fingerprints Fraudsters obtain customers' fingerprints through websites where land-owning documents are public or where fingerprints can be sold to fraudsters by people who can obtain copies of victims' fingerprints through objects in their homes Essentially, one's fingerprints work as a password that cannot be changed, unlike credit card PINs and many other similar protective services [197]\n\n\nApplication issues\nWhile the service is free for citizens, some agents have been charging fees [198] Despite the modern processes, there are cases where enrolments are lost in the system without explanation mAadhaar is an official mobile application developed by the UIDAI to provide an interface for Aadhaar number holders to carry their demographic information including name, date of birth, gender, and address along with a photograph linked with their Aadhaar number in smartphones In one case, every resident in a village in Haridwar was assigned a birthday of 1 January [199]\n\n\nThreat of exclusion\nMany private and public benefits are being linked to Aadhaar numbers and made contingent on it: food aid, cooking-gas subsidies, mobile connections, NREGA wages, government examinations, banking facilities, tax filings, etc In fact, much of the massive enrolment resulted from the fear of being excluded from these benefits There have been instances where people have been denied food aid because of issues with authentication arising from network issues or problems with identifying fingerprints (sometimes fingerprints become faded from age or manual labour) [200]\n\n\nData leaks and security incidents\nThe Aadhaar database has experienced multiple data leaks and security breaches since its inception These have ranged from the sale of unauthorised access by database administrators, the exposure of personal information on government websites, and unauthorised use and access of Aadhaar data by private institutions.\n\n\n2017\nIn February 2017, the Unique Identification Authority of India filed a police complaint after confirming that Axis Bank, a private banking institution, Suvidhaa Infoserve (a business news reporter) and eMudhra (an agency providing e-signature services) had illegally accessed the Aadhaar database and further, had impersonated people after illegally storing their personal data [217] In April 2017, the government of the state of Jharkhand exposed Aadhaar details and personal information of over 10 lakh (1 million) people as a result of a programming mistake on the website of the Jharkhand Directorate of Social Security, making this information available to any person who was logged on to the website [218] [219]\n\n\n2018\nIn 2018, the Aadhaar database suffered several breaches, resulting in 1.1 billion people's data being leaked and compromised This was described by the World Economic Forum 2019 Global Risks Report as the \"largest breach\" of personal information in that year [234] In the same year, Right to Information petitions filed by media organisations indicated that 210 Indian government officials and institutions had posted parts of the Aadhaar database in publicly accessible sources, resulting in the leak of personal data, resulting in post-facto removals of this data by the Unique Identification Authority of India [235]\n\n\nVirtual ID\nOn 1 March 2018, Virtual ID aka VID was introduced and was made as an option for agencies to use Virtual ID by 1 September 2018 A Virtual ID is a 16-digit number that is generated using the Aadhaar number This Virtual ID can then be used instead of the Aadhaar number to carry out some Aadhaar-related work [citation needed] [251]\n\n\nRevolving door problem\n\nThe question of the \"revolving door\" phenomenon (where \"individuals using experience, knowledge and clout gained while in public service in pursuit of profit for private companies\") has been raised in the context of Aadhaar, as people who were involved in the creation, design, and popularisation of Aadhaar are now working in the private sector where they can use this knowledge for their own private enterprises which profit off this knowledge Some examples of this are Khosla Labs as well as iSPIRT, a non-profit organisation which is dedicated to developing and supporting India Stack's APIs has had many employees who were involved with UIDAI in various capacities [252]\n\nCAG Report on the functioning of the UIDAI\nIn April 2022, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India published an audit report on the functioning of the UIDAI The report contains observations and recommendations based on a performance audit – which included assessments of both the Enrolment and Update Ecosystems as well as the Authentication Ecosystems for the period 2014–15 to 2018–19 The press release lists the Summary of Performance, Significant Audit Findings, and the recommendations [253] [254]\n\n\nDrive to link Aadhaar with Voter ID card\nIn 2022, the Election Commission started a drive to link the Aadhaar card with the voter ID card [255] The Union Government claimed that this linking will be voluntary, but the bill passed in the parliament contradicts the claim [256] The rules issued by the Union Government mention that the only \"sufficient cause\" for a person to not link their Aadhaar Card with the Voter ID Card is if the person does not have one The election officials cited 'orders from above' to pressure voters into linking these documents [257]\n\n\nSee also\nCurrently serving as the chairman of Technical Advisory Group for

jurisdiction of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, following the provisions of the Aadhaar Act 2016.\n\n**History**\n\nIn 1999 after the Kargil war, the Kargil Review Committee, headed by security analyst K Subrahmanyam, was formed to study the state of national security. It submitted its report to the then Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, on 7 January 2000. Among its various recommendations was the proposal that citizens in villages in border regions be issued identity cards on a priority basis, with such ID cards issued later to all people living in border states.\n\n**Previous identity card programs**\n\nIn 1999 after the Kargil war, the Kargil Review Committee, headed by security analyst K Subrahmanyam, was formed to study the state of national security. It submitted its report to the then Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, on 7 January 2000. Among its various recommendations was the proposal that citizens in villages in border regions be issued identity cards on a priority basis, with such ID cards issued later to all people living in border states.\n\n**2009-2013**\n\nThe UIDAI was established on 28 January 2009 after the Planning Commission issued a notification. On 23 June Nandan Nilekani, the co-founder of Infosys, was appointed by the then-government, UPA, to head the project. He was given the newly created position of Chairman of the UIDAI, which was equivalent in rank to a Cabinet minister. In April 2010 the logo and the brand name Aadhaar was launched by Nilekani. In May 2010 Nilekani said he would support legislation to protect the data held by the UIDAI.\n\n**2014-2015**\n\nIn March 2014 Nilekani resigned as the chairman to contest in the general election on an Indian National Congress nomination from Bangalore South. His responsibilities were taken over by 1981-batch IAS officer Vijay Madan, who was given an extension of his term as the director-general and mission director by the government. Nilekani lost to Ananth Kumar.\n\n**2016-present**\n\nDuring the budget presentation on 29 February 2016, Jaitley announced that a bill would be introduced within a week to provide legislative support to the Aadhaar project. On 3 March 2016 the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016, was introduced in the Parliament as a money bill by Jaitley. The decision to introduce it as a money bill was criticised by the opposition parties. Ghulam Nabi Azad, an INC leader, wrote in a letter to Jaitley that the ruling party, the BJP, was attempting to bypass the Rajya Sabha, as they did not have the majority in the upper house. A money bill is only required to pass in the lower house Lok Sabha.\n\n**Predominant uses of Aadhaar**\n\nThe Aadhaar project has been linked to welfare schemes and unemployment benefit schemes such as the domestic LPG scheme and MGNREGA. In these Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) schemes, the subsidy money is directly transferred to a bank account which is Aadhaar-linked. Previously, however, the direct-benefit transfer had been carried out quite successfully via the National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) system, which did not depend on Aadhaar.\n\n**Direct Benefit Transfer**\n\nThe Aadhaar project has been linked to welfare schemes and unemployment benefit schemes such as the domestic LPG scheme and MGNREGA.

Previously, however, the direct-benefit transfer had been carried out quite successfully via the National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) system, which did not depend on Aadhaar.\n\n**Aadhaar-enabled biometric attendance systems**\n\nIn July 2014 Aadhaar-enabled biometric attendance systems were introduced in government offices. The system was introduced to check the late arrival and absenteeism of government employees. The public could see the daily in and out of employees on the website attendance.gov.in. In October 2014 the website was closed to the public but as of 24 March 2016 is again active and open to public access. The employees use the last four digits (last eight digits for government employee registering as of August 2016) of their Aadhaar number and their fingerprints, for authentication.\n\n**Other uses by central government agencies**\n\nIn November 2014 it was reported that the Ministry for External Affairs was considering making Aadhaar a mandatory requirement for passport holders. In February 2015 it was reported that people with an Aadhaar number would get their passports issued within 10 days, as it sped up the verification process by making it easier to check if an applicant had any criminal records in the National Crime Records Bureau database. In May 2015, it was announced that the Ministry of External Affairs was testing the linking of passports to the Aadhaar database.\n\n**Other uses by states**\n\nIn the Hyderabad region of Telangana state, Aadhaar numbers were linked to ration cards to remove duplicate ration cards. The project was started in July 2012 and was carried out despite the 2013 Supreme Court order. More than 63,932 ration cards in the white category and 229,757 names were removed from its database in the drive between July 2012 and September 2014. In August 2012 the government of the state of Andhra Pradesh asked citizens to surrender illegal ration cards before it began to link them with Aadhaar numbers. By September 2014, 15 lakh (1.5 million) illegal ration cards had been surrendered. In April 2015 the state of Maharashtra began enrolling all school students in the state in the Aadhaar project to implement the Right to Education Act properly.\n\n**PVC Card**\n\nIn 2020, UIDAI introduced a new physical Aadhaar card made of PVC with additional security features such as holograms, micro text, ghost images, guilloché Patterns, invisible logos etc. The PVC Aadhaar Card can be ordered by any Aadhaar holder from UIDAI's official website and it will be delivered to the Aadhaar holder's registered address in the UIDAI database via Speed Post at a fee of ₹50.\n\n**Bhudhaar**\n\nGovernment of Andhra Pradesh started Aadhaar based innovative first of its kind project called Bhudhaar to assign an 11-digit unique number for every land parcel in the state as part of the \"land hub in E-Pragati Programme\". Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu launched the programme on 20 November 2018 to streamline the land records. Union Government of India also implementing Unique Land Parcel Identification Number (ULPIN) Project with the reference from this Bhudhaar Project.\n\n**Criticism and concerns**\n\nIn October 2010 R Ramakumar, an economist at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, wrote in an editorial for The Hindu that the project was being implemented without any cost-benefit or feasibility studies to ensure whether the project would meet its stipulated goals. He also pointed out that the government was obscuring the security aspects of Aadhaar and focusing on the social benefit schemes. He quoted a former chief of the Intelligence Bureau Ajit Doval, who had said that originally Aadhaar aimed to weed out illegal aliens.\n\n**Feasibility concerns**\n\nIn October 2010 R Ramakumar, an economist at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, wrote in an editorial for The Hindu that the project was being implemented without any cost-benefit or feasibility studies to ensure whether the project would meet its stipulated goals. He also pointed out that the government was obscuring the security aspects of Aadhaar and focusing on the social benefit schemes. He quoted a former chief of the Intelligence Bureau Ajit Doval, who had said that originally Aadhaar aimed to weed out illegal aliens.\n\n**Lack of legislation and privacy concerns**\n\nOn 2 February 2015, the Supreme Court asked the new government to clarify its stance on the project. This was in response to a new PIL filed by Mathew Thomas, a former army officer. Thomas had claimed that the government was ignoring previous orders while pushing ahead with the project and that the project was unconstitutional as it allowed profiling of citizens. In a reply on 12 February the government said that it would continue the project. On 16 July 2015 the government requested the Supreme Court to revoke its order, saying that it intended to use Aadhaar for various services. On 21 July 2015 the Court noted that some states were insisting on Aadhaar for benefits despite its order.\n\n**Legality of sharing data with law enforcement**\n\nIn 2013 in Goa the CBI was trying to solve the case of a rape of a schoolgirl. It approached a Goa local court saying that they had acquired some fingerprints from the scene that could be matched with the UIDAI database. The court asked the UIDAI to hand over all data of all persons in Goa to the CBI.\n\n**Land allotment dispute**\n\nIn September 2013 the Delhi Development Authority accepted a complaint from the activist group India Against Corruption and cancelled a land allotment to the UIDAI. The land was previously owned by BSNL, and MTNL had also laid claims on it. It had an estimated ₹9 billion (US$110 million) value but had been allotted to the UIDAI at a very cheap rate.\n\n**Security concerns**\n\nIn an August 2009 interview with the Tehelka, former chief of the Intelligence Bureau (IB), Ajit Doval, said that Aadhaar was originally intended to flush out illegal immigrants, but social security benefits were later added to avoid privacy concerns. In December 2011 the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance, led by Yashwant Sinha, rejected the National Identification Authority of India Bill, 2010, and suggested modifications. It expressed objections to the issuing of Aadhaar numbers to illegal immigrants. The Committee said that the project was being implemented in an unplanned manner and bypassing the Parliament.\n\n**Overlaps with National Population Register**\n\nThe Aadhaar and the similar National Population Register (NPR) projects have been reported to be having conflicts. In January 2012 it was reported that the UIDAI would share its data with NPR and the NPR would continue to collect its own data. In January 2013 then-Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde said that Aadhaar was not an identity card but a number, while the NPR was necessary for national security purposes. The 2013 Supreme Court order did not affect the NPR project as it was not linked to any subsidy.\n\n**Fraud**\n\nIn order to make Aadhaar accessible to often undocumented poorer citizens, obtaining an Aadhaar card does not require significant documentation, with multiple options available. In theory, the use of biometric facilities should reduce or eliminate duplication. So, in theory, while it may be possible to obtain the card under a false name, it is less likely that a person would be able to obtain another Aadhaar card under a different (or real) name.\n\n**Cloning of biometric data**\n\nAadhaar data is linked to the fingerprints of cardholders. This has been used by fraudsters to withdraw money from bank accounts. Most people have linked their bank accounts to their Aadhaar identity due to the mandatory nature of the linkage as promoted by the government. The Aadhaar program automatically enrolls the bank customer into a payment system wherein money can be withdrawn from their bank account using their Aadhaar card numbers and fingerprints. Fraudsters obtain customers' fingerprints through websites where land-owning documents are public or where fingerprints can be sold to fraudsters by people who can obtain copies of victims' fingerprints through objects in their homes. Essentially, one's fingerprints work as a password that cannot be changed, unlike credit card PINs and many other similar protective services.\n\n**Application issues**\n\nWhile the service is free for citizens, some agents have been charging fees. Despite the modern processes, there are cases where enrolments are lost in the system without explanation. mAadhaar is an official mobile application developed by the UIDAI to provide an interface for Aadhaar number holders to carry their demographic information including name, date of birth, gender, and address along with a photograph linked with their Aadhaar number in smartphones. In one case, every resident in a village in Haridwar was assigned a birthday of 1 January.\n\n**Threat of exclusion**\n\nMany private and public benefits are being linked to Aadhaar numbers and made contingent on it: food aid, cooking-gas subsidies, mobile connections, NREGA wages, government examinations, banking facilities, tax filings, etc. In fact, much of the massive enrolment resulted from the fear of being excluded from these benefits. There have been instances where people have been denied food aid because of issues with authentication arising from network issues or problems with identifying fingerprints (sometimes fingerprints become faded from age or manual labour).\n\n**Data leaks and security incidents**\n\nThe Aadhaar database has experienced multiple data leaks and security breaches since its inception. These have ranged from the sale of unauthorised access by database administrators, the exposure of personal information on government websites, and unauthorised use and access of Aadhaar data by private institutions.\n\n**2022**\n\nIn 2022, the Election Commission started a drive to link the Aadhaar card with the voter ID card. The Union Government claimed that this linking will be voluntary, but the bill passed in the parliament contradicts the claim. The rules issued by the Union Government mention that the only \"sufficient cause\" for a person to not link their Aadhaar Card with the Voter ID Card is if the person does not have one. The election officials cited 'orders from above' to pressure voters into linking these documents.\n\n**See also**\n\nCurrently serving as the chairman of Technical Advisory Group for Unique

from age or manual labour) [200]\n\n\nData leaks and security incidents\nThe Aadhaar database has experienced multiple data leaks and security breaches since its inception These have ranged from the sale of unauthorised access by database administrators, the exposure of personal information on government websites, and unauthorised use and access of Aadhaar data by private institutions.\n\n\n2017\nIn February 2017, the Unique Identification Authority of India filed a police complaint after confirming that Axis Bank, a private banking institution, Suvidhaa Infoserve (a business news reporter) and eMudhra (an agency providing e-signature services) had illegally accessed the Aadhaar database and further, had impersonated people after illegally storing their personal data [217] In April 2017, the government of the state of Jharkhand exposed Aadhaar details and personal information of over 10 lakh (1 million) people as a result of a programming mistake on the website of the Jharkhand Directorate of Social Security, making this information available to any person who was logged on to the website [218] [219]\n\n\n2018\nIn 2018, the Aadhaar database suffered several breaches, resulting in 1.1 billion people's data being leaked and compromised This was described by the World Economic Forum 2019 Global Risks Report as the \"largest breach\" of personal information in that year [234] In the same year, Right to Information petitions filed by media organisations indicated that 210 Indian government officials and institutions had posted parts of the Aadhaar database in publicly accessible sources, resulting in the leak of personal data, resulting in post-facto removals of this data by the Unique Identification Authority of India [235]\n\n\nVirtual ID\nOn 1 March 2018, Virtual ID aka VID was introduced and was made as an option for agencies to use Virtual ID by 1 September 2018 A Virtual ID is a 16-digit number that is generated using the Aadhaar number This Virtual ID can then be used instead of the Aadhaar number to carry out some Aadhaar-related work [citation needed] [251]\n\n\nRevolving door problem\n\nThe question of the \"revolving door\" phenomenon (where \"individuals using experience, knowledge and clout gained while in public service in pursuit of profit for private companies\") has been raised in the context of Aadhaar, as people who were involved in the creation, design, and popularisation of Aadhaar are now working in the private sector where they can use this knowledge for their own private enterprises which profit off this knowledge Some examples of this are Khosla Labs as well as iSPIRT, a non-profit organisation which is dedicated to developing and supporting India Stack's APIs has had many employees who were involved with UIDAI in various capacities [252]\n\nCAG Report on the functioning of the UIDAI\nIn April 2022, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India published an audit report on the functioning of the UIDAI The report contains observations and recommendations based on a performance audit – which included assessments of both the Enrolment and Update Ecosystems as well as the Authentication Ecosystems for the period 2014–15 to 2018–19 The press release lists the Summary of Performance, Significant Audit Findings, and the recommendations [253] [254]\n\n\nDrive to link Aadhaar with Voter ID card\nIn 2022, the Election Commission started a drive to link the Aadhaar card with the voter ID card [255] The Union Government claimed that this

Bowl 50: Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida [26] [27] The South Florida bid for either Super Bowl partially depended on whether the stadium underwent renovations However, on May 3, the

refused to approve the funding plan to pay for the renovations, dealing a blow to South Florida's chances [28] The NFL ultimately selected Houston as the host city of Super Bowl LI [29]\n\n\nProposition 1 controversy\nProposition 1, an ordinance which would have prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in Houston's housing, employment, public accommodations, and city contracting, was rejected by voters (60.97% opposing [30]) during the November 3, 2015 elections Nonetheless, the NFL announced it would not alter plans to have the city host Super Bowl LI [31] [32] Houston Texans owner Bob McNair donated $10,000 to Campaign for Houston, an organization that opposes the ordinance, which he later rescinded [33]\n\n\nTeams\nIn 2016, New England tied an NFL record, earning 12+ wins for the seventh consecutive season Even though starting quarterback Tom Brady was suspended for the first four games, and All-Pro tight end Rob Gronkowski was lost to injury in midseason, the Patriots still recorded an NFL-best 14–2 record; their only losses were a shutout loss to the Buffalo Bills in Week 4 and a loss to the Seattle Seahawks in Week 10 [34] [35] They scored 441 points (third in the NFL) while allowing the fewest in the league (250) [36]\n\n\nNew England Patriots\nIn 2016, New England tied an NFL record, earning 12+ wins

the NFL) while allowing the fewest in the league (250) [36]\n\n\nAtlanta Falcons\nThe Atlanta Falcons, under second-year head coach Dan Quinn, finished the 2016 season with an 11–5 record, earning them the No 2 seed in the NFC playoffs It was a major reversal of declining fortunes for the team, which had failed to qualify to play in the playoffs in each of the last three seasons [43]\n\n\nPlayoffs\nThe Patriots, with the AFC's #1 seed, began their postseason run by defeating the fourth-seeded Houston Texans in the Divisional Round, 34–16 [51] [52] The next week, in the AFC Championship Game, the Patriots defeated the third-seeded Pittsburgh Steelers 36–17 [53] [54]\n\n\nPre-game notes\nAs the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams, the Falcons elected to wear their red home jerseys with white pants, [60] [61] which meant that the Patriots wore their white road jerseys [60] The game featured Atlanta's #1 scoring offense versus New England's #1 scoring defense This was the sixth Super Bowl since the AFL–NFL merger in 1970 to feature a #1 scoring offense against a #1 scoring defense, with the team with the #1 scoring defense winning four of the previous five matchups [62] [63]\n\n\nSuper Bowl week events\nFan-oriented activities during the lead-up to Super Bowl LI were centered around the George R Brown Convention Center and Discovery Green park Discovery Green hosted Super Bowl Live, a 10-day festival which featured live concerts and other attractions, including projection shows, fireworks shows, and a virtual reality attraction, Future Flight, in conjunction with NASA The neighboring George R Brown Convention Center hosted the annual NFL Experience event, which featured interactive activities and appearances by players [65] Super Bowl Opening Night, the second edition of the game's revamped media day, was held on January 30, 2017, at nearby Minute Maid Park [66]\n\n\nTeam facilities\nThe Patriots stayed at the JW Marriott Houston and practiced at the University of Houston The Falcons stayed at the Westin Houston Memorial City and practiced at Rice University [70]\n\n\nTickets\nIn the beginning of February 2017 the NFL and law enforcement announced that tickets to Super Bowl LI would feature heat-sensitive logos to deter counterfeit tickets On the front of each ticket was a full polymer graphic that was raised and the back featured a true color security label with Houston's skyline and the Super Bowl logo The final security feature was a graphic on the lower portion of the back of each ticket printed with thermochromic ink The HTX logo and the NRG Stadium image faded when heat was applied and returned when the heat source was removed [71]\n\n\nTransportation issue\nIn late 2016, Uber had threatened to leave Houston ahead of the Super Bowl LI festivities, insisting various city regulations, including fingerprint background checks of drivers, were too burdensome and prevented drivers from working Houston officials and Uber reached a compromise in December, which determined that Houston would continue to require a fingerprint check for drivers but eliminate requirements for driver drug testing and physicals through at least February 5 [72]\n\n\nBroadcasting\nIn the United States, Super Bowl LI was televised by Fox, as part of a cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL [73] [74] It was called by Joe Buck on play-by-play  and Troy Aikman as color commentator [75]\n\n\nUnited States\nIn the United States, Super Bowl LI was

on play-by-play  and Troy Aikman as color commentator [75]\n\n\nRatings\nAn average of 111.3 million viewers watched Super Bowl LI, marking Super Bowl's second consecutive year of average viewership drop since its previous average high in 2015 [82] [83] However, viewership steadily increased since the end of halftime when it eventually became the first overtime game in Super Bowl history Fox and NFL stated that 1.72 million viewers utilized its online streams, and by the conclusion of overtime, the broadcast gained 172 million viewers (more than half of the U.S population of 340 million people that same year) [84] [85] This still stands as the largest overall audience ever tallied by any broadcast in U.S television history [19]\n\n\nAdvertising\nFox set the base rate for a 30-second commercial at $5 million, the same rate CBS charged for Super Bowl 50, [86] leading to advertising revenue of $534 million for the single day event [87] Snickers announced that it would present a live commercial during the game [86] Nintendo broadcast an ad showcasing its upcoming Nintendo Switch video game console [88] Fiat Chrysler Automobiles broadcast three spots for Alfa Romeo, as part of an effort to re-launch the Italian brand in the U.S [89] [90]\n\n\nStreaming\nOnline streams of the game were provided via Fox Sports Go; although normally requiring a television subscription to use, Fox made the service available as a free preview for the Super Bowl Due to Verizon Communications exclusivity, streaming on smartphones was exclusive to Verizon Wireless subscribers via the NFL Mobile app [99] [100]\n\n\nRadio\nIn the United States, Westwood One carried the broadcast nationwide, with Kevin Harlan on play-by-play, Boomer Esiason and Mike Holmgren on color commentary, and sideline reports from Tony Boselli and James Lofton [101] The Westwood One broadcast was simulcast in Canada on TSN Radio [102] Each team's network flagship station carried the local feed: WBZ-FM for the Patriots (with Bob Socci and Scott Zolak announcing), and WZGC for the Falcons (with Wes Durham and Dave Archer announcing); under the league's contract with Westwood One, no other stations in the teams' usual radio networks were allowed to carry the local broadcast, and unlike in recent years when at least one of the two flagships was a clear-channel station, both the Patriots and Falcons use FM radio stations as their local flagships, limiting listenership to those within the local metropolitan areas or with access to those feeds via Sirius XM satellite radio or TuneIn Premium.\n\n\nInternational\nCanadian broadcast rights to Super Bowl LI were subject to a legal dispute; although U.S network affiliates are carried by pay TV providers in the country, Canadian law grants domestic broadcast stations the right to require that these signals be substituted with their own if they are carrying the same program in simulcast with a U.S station (\"simsub\") This policy is intended to help protect Canadian advertising revenue from being lost to viewers watching via U.S feeds of a program In 2016, as part of a larger series of regulatory reforms, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) banned the Super Bowl from being substituted under these circumstances, meaning that the telecast on CTV—a simulcast of the U.S telecast with Canadian advertising inserted, would co-exist with feeds of the game from U.S network affiliates The CRTC cited dissatisfaction surrounding the practice from Canadian viewers—particularly the unavailability of the U.S commercials, which the CRTC cited as being an \"integral part\" of the game based on this reception, but also other technical problems caused by poorly implemented simsubs (such as reduced quality and missing content due to mistimed transitions back into the U.S program feed) [124] [125] [126]\n\n\nCanadian broadcast\nCanadian broadcast rights to Super Bowl LI were

producer of the show, John Entz, confirmed Gaga's involvement adding \" [She] is one of the most electric performers of our generation, and we couldn't be happier with the choice to have her headline the Super Bowl LI Halftime Show,\" he also said that it would be \"an incredible night.\" [143]\n\n\nGame summary\nThe first quarter was scoreless, with each team punting twice The longest play from scrimmage was the Falcons' first offensive play of the game, a 37-yard run by running back Devonta Freeman Although this run did not lead to any points, it was the longest rushing play of the game for

half, the Patriots had an early scoring opportunity when Edelman returned Matt Bosher's punt 26 yards to the New England 47-yard line, but they could not gain a first down on the drive The Falcons started their next drive on their own 15-yard line; Ryan completed two long passes to Gabriel for gains of 17 and 35 yards, followed by a 13-yard pass to wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, to bring the ball to the New England 28-yard line Three plays later, Ryan finished the eight-play, 85-yard drive with a 6-yard touchdown pass to running back Tevin Coleman, giving the Falcons a 28–3 lead with 8:31 left in the quarter [155]\n\n\nOvertime\nThe Patriots won the coin toss to start overtime and elected to receive the ball Starting at their 25-yard line after a touchback, Brady completed passes to White, Amendola, and Hogan for gains of 6, 14, and 18 yards, respectively Then, after White was tackled by Deion Jones for a 3-yard loss, Brady completed a 15-yard pass to Edelman to reach the Atlanta 25-yard line White then took a lateral throw from Brady to the 15-yard line [165]\n\n\nStatistics and records\nSuper Bowl LI had more than 30 records either broken or tied by the time it was finished [16] [171] Brady completed 43 of 62 passes for 466 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception, while also rushing for 15 yards His completions, attempts, and passing yards were all single-game

record with three touchdowns He also set the record for most points scored with 20 After the game, Brady said he felt White deserved the MVP award more than he did [172] Brady planned to give White the vehicle that has traditionally been awarded to Super Bowl MVPs (he'd given the truck he received after Super Bowl XLIX to Malcolm Butler [173]) but found out after the game that there was no vehicle to give to White because the sponsor had decided to end its practice of donating one Edelman caught five passes for 87 yards and returned three punts for 39 yards Amendola recorded eight receptions for 78 yards and one touchdown Flowers recorded six tackles and 2.5 sacks The Patriots overall gained an NFL postseason record 37 first downs in the game.\n\n\nBox score\nat NRG Stadium,

Brady a lecture that inspires him to turn around the team's halftime deficit and win the game.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Super_Bowl_LI\" following this

Reliant Stadium in Houston, which was renamed NRG Stadium in 2014, was a finalist to host Super Bowl LI [27] Houston then competed against the runner-up for the site of Super Bowl 50: Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida [26] [27] The South Florida bid for either Super Bowl partially depended on whether the stadium underwent renovations However, on May 3, the Florida Legislature refused to approve the funding plan to pay for the renovations, dealing a blow to South Florida's chances [28] The NFL ultimately selected Houston as the host city of Super Bowl LI [29]\n\n\nHost-selection process\nThe NFL selected the sites for Super Bowl 50 and Super Bowl LI at the owners' spring meetings in Boston on May 21, 2013 [26] On October 16, 2012, the NFL announced

refused to approve the funding plan to pay for the renovations, dealing a blow to South Florida's chances [28] The NFL ultimately selected Houston as the host city of Super Bowl LI [29]\n\n\nProposition 1 controversy\nProposition 1, an ordinance which would have prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in Houston's housing, employment, public accommodations, and city contracting, was rejected by voters (60.97% opposing [30]) during the November 3, 2015 elections Nonetheless, the NFL announced it would not alter plans to have the city host Super Bowl LI [31] [32] Houston Texans owner Bob McNair donated $10,000 to Campaign for Houston, an organization that opposes the ordinance, which he later rescinded [33]\n\n\nTeams\nIn 2016, New England tied an NFL record, earning 12+ wins for the seventh consecutive season Even though starting quarterback Tom Brady was suspended for the first four games, and All-Pro tight end Rob Gronkowski was lost to injury in midseason, the Patriots still recorded an NFL-best 14–2 record; their only losses were a shutout loss to the Buffalo Bills in Week 4 and a loss to the Seattle Seahawks in Week 10 [34] [35] They scored 441 points (third in the NFL) while allowing the fewest in the league (250) [36]\n\n\nNew England Patriots\nIn 2016, New England tied an NFL record, earning 12+ wins

the NFL) while allowing the fewest in the league (250) [36]\n\n\nAtlanta Falcons\nThe Atlanta Falcons, under second-year head coach Dan Quinn, finished the 2016 season with an 11–5 record, earning them the No 2 seed in the NFC playoffs It was a major reversal of declining fortunes for the team, which had failed to qualify to play in the playoffs in each of the last three seasons [43]\n\n\nPlayoffs\nThe Patriots, with the AFC's #1 seed, began their postseason run by defeating the fourth-seeded Houston Texans in the Divisional Round, 34–16 [51] [52] The next week, in the AFC Championship Game, the Patriots defeated the third-seeded Pittsburgh Steelers 36–17 [53] [54]\n\n\nPre-game notes\nAs the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams, the Falcons elected to wear their red home jerseys with white pants, [60] [61] which meant that the Patriots wore their white road jerseys [60] The game featured Atlanta's #1 scoring offense versus New England's #1 scoring defense This was the sixth Super Bowl since the AFL–NFL merger in 1970 to feature a #1 scoring offense against a #1 scoring defense, with the team with the #1 scoring defense winning four of the previous five matchups [62] [63]\n\n\nSuper Bowl week events\nFan-oriented activities during the lead-up to Super Bowl LI were centered around the George R Brown Convention Center and Discovery Green park Discovery Green hosted Super Bowl Live, a 10-day festival which featured live concerts and other attractions, including projection shows, fireworks shows, and a virtual reality attraction, Future Flight, in conjunction with NASA The neighboring George R Brown Convention Center hosted the annual NFL Experience event, which featured interactive activities and appearances by players [65] Super Bowl Opening Night, the second edition of the game's revamped media day, was held on January 30, 2017, at nearby Minute Maid Park [66]\n\n\nTeam facilities\nThe Patriots stayed at the JW Marriott Houston and practiced at the University of Houston The Falcons stayed at the Westin Houston Memorial City and practiced at Rice University [70]\n\n\nTickets\nIn the beginning of February 2017 the NFL and law enforcement announced that tickets to Super Bowl LI would feature heat-sensitive logos to deter counterfeit tickets On the front of each ticket was a full polymer graphic that was raised and the back featured a true color security label with Houston's skyline and the Super Bowl logo The final security feature was a graphic on the lower portion of the back of each ticket printed with thermochromic ink The HTX logo and the NRG Stadium image faded when heat was applied and returned when the heat source was removed [71]\n\n\nTransportation issue\nIn late 2016, Uber had threatened to leave Houston ahead of the Super Bowl LI festivities, insisting various city regulations, including fingerprint background checks of drivers, were too burdensome and prevented drivers from working Houston officials and Uber reached a compromise in December, which determined that Houston would continue to require a fingerprint check for drivers but eliminate requirements for driver drug testing and physicals through at least February 5 [72]\n\n\nBroadcasting\nIn the United States, Super Bowl LI was televised by Fox, as part of a cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL [73] [74] It was called by Joe Buck on play-by-play  and Troy Aikman as color commentator [75]\n\n\nUnited States\nIn the United States, Super Bowl LI was

on play-by-play  and Troy Aikman as color commentator [75]\n\n\nRatings\nAn average of 111.3 million viewers watched Super Bowl LI, marking Super Bowl's second consecutive year of average viewership drop since its previous average high in 2015 [82] [83] However, viewership steadily increased since the end of halftime when it eventually became the first overtime game in Super Bowl history Fox and NFL stated that 1.72 million viewers utilized its online streams, and by the conclusion of overtime, the broadcast gained 172 million viewers (more than half of the U.S population of 340 million people that same year) [84] [85] This still stands as the largest overall audience ever tallied by any broadcast in U.S television history [19]\n\n\nAdvertising\nFox set the base rate for a 30-second commercial at $5 million, the same rate CBS charged for Super Bowl 50, [86] leading to advertising revenue of $534 million for the single day event [87] Snickers announced that it would present a live commercial during the game [86] Nintendo broadcast an ad showcasing its upcoming Nintendo Switch video game console [88] Fiat Chrysler Automobiles broadcast three spots for Alfa Romeo, as part of an effort to re-launch the Italian brand in the U.S [89] [90]\n\n\nStreaming\nOnline streams of the game were provided via Fox Sports Go; although normally requiring a television subscription to use, Fox made the service available as a free preview for the Super Bowl Due to Verizon Communications exclusivity, streaming on smartphones was exclusive to Verizon Wireless subscribers via the NFL Mobile app [99] [100]\n\n\nRadio\nIn the United States, Westwood One carried the broadcast nationwide, with Kevin Harlan on play-by-play, Boomer Esiason and Mike Holmgren on color commentary, and sideline reports from Tony Boselli and James Lofton [101] The Westwood One broadcast was simulcast in Canada on TSN Radio [102] Each team's network flagship station carried the local feed: WBZ-FM for the Patriots (with Bob Socci and Scott Zolak announcing), and WZGC for the Falcons (with Wes Durham and Dave Archer announcing); under the league's contract with Westwood One, no other stations in the teams' usual radio networks were allowed to carry the local broadcast, and unlike in recent years when at least one of the two flagships was a clear-channel station, both the Patriots and Falcons use FM radio stations as their local flagships, limiting listenership to those within the local metropolitan areas or with access to those feeds via Sirius XM satellite radio or TuneIn Premium.\n\n\nInternational\nCanadian broadcast rights to Super Bowl LI were subject to a legal dispute; although U.S network affiliates are carried by pay TV providers in the country, Canadian law grants domestic broadcast stations the right to require that these signals be substituted with their own if they are carrying the same program in simulcast with a U.S station (\"simsub\") This policy is intended to help protect Canadian advertising revenue from being lost to viewers watching via U.S feeds of a program In 2016, as part of a larger series of regulatory reforms, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) banned the Super Bowl from being substituted under these circumstances, meaning that the telecast on CTV—a simulcast of the U.S telecast with Canadian advertising inserted, would co-exist with feeds of the game from U.S network affiliates The CRTC cited dissatisfaction surrounding the practice from Canadian viewers—particularly the unavailability of the U.S commercials, which the CRTC cited as being an \"integral part\" of the game based on this reception, but also other technical problems caused by poorly implemented simsubs (such as reduced quality and missing content due to mistimed transitions back into the U.S program feed) [124] [125] [126]\n\n\nCanadian broadcast\nCanadian broadcast rights to Super Bowl LI were

Super Bowl LI halftime show on her Instagram account with the message: \"It's not an illusion The rumors are true This year the SUPER BOWL goes GAGA!\" [142] Fox Sports president and executive producer of the show, John Entz, confirmed Gaga's involvement adding \" [She] is one of the most electric performers of our generation, and we couldn't be happier with the choice to have her headline the Super Bowl LI Halftime Show,\" he also said that it would be \"an incredible night.\" [143]\n\n\nGame summary\nThe first quarter was scoreless, with each team punting twice The longest play from scrimmage was the Falcons' first offensive play of the game, a 37-yard run by running back Devonta Freeman Although this run did not lead to any points, it was the longest rushing play of the game for either team.\n\n\nFirst half\nThe first quarter was scoreless, with each team punting twice The longest play from scrimmage was the Falcons' first offensive play of the game, a 37-yard run by running back Devonta Freeman Although this run did not lead to any points, it was the longest rushing play of the game for either team.\n\n\nSecond half\nAfter forcing Atlanta to punt to start the second half, the Patriots had an early scoring opportunity when Edelman returned Matt Bosher's punt 26 yards to the New England 47-yard line, but they could not gain a first down on the drive The Falcons started their next drive on their own 15-yard line; Ryan completed two long passes to Gabriel for gains of 17 and 35 yards, followed by a 13-yard pass to wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, to bring the ball to the New England 28-yard line Three plays later, Ryan finished the eight-play, 85-yard drive with a 6-yard touchdown pass to running back Tevin Coleman, giving the Falcons a 28–3 lead with 8:31 left in the quarter [155]\n\n\nOvertime\nThe Patriots won the coin toss to start overtime and elected to receive the ball Starting at their 25-yard line after a touchback, Brady completed passes to White, Amendola, and Hogan for gains of 6, 14, and 18 yards, respectively Then, after White was tackled by Deion Jones for a 3-yard loss, Brady completed a 15-yard pass to Edelman to reach the Atlanta 25-yard line White then took a lateral throw from Brady to the 15-yard line [165]\n\n\nStatistics and records\nSuper Bowl LI had more than 30 records either broken or tied by the time it was finished [16] [171] Brady completed 43 of 62 passes for 466 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception, while also rushing for 15 yards His completions, attempts, and passing yards were all single-game Super Bowl records Brady ultimately became the first quarterback to win a Super Bowl in which he threw a ball that was intercepted for a touchdown He also set the career Super Bowl records for games played (7), completions (207), attempts (309), yards (2,071), and touchdown passes (15) James White caught a Super Bowl record 14 passes for 110 yards, rushed for 29 yards, and tied a Super Bowl record with three touchdowns He also set the record for most points scored with 20 After the game, Brady said he felt White deserved the MVP award more than he did [172] Brady planned to give White the vehicle that has traditionally been awarded to Super Bowl MVPs (he'd given the truck he received after Super Bowl XLIX to Malcolm Butler [173]) but found out after the game that there was no vehicle to give to White because the sponsor had decided to end its practice of donating one Edelman caught five passes for 87 yards and returned three punts for 39 yards Amendola recorded eight receptions for 78 yards and one touchdown Flowers recorded six tackles and 2.5 sacks The Patriots overall gained an NFL postseason record 37 first downs in the game.\n\n\nBox score\nat NRG Stadium,

No, not our nation's, but in World War II I mean, we all lived in this century I didn't live in this century, but in this century's history\" [3]), or just confused (such as the comments he made in a May 1989 address to the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) Commenting on the UNCF's slogan—which is \"a mind is a terrible thing to waste\"—Quayle said, \"You take the UNCF model that what a waste it is to lose one's mind or not to have a mind is being very wasteful How true that is\") [35] [36]\n\n\n1992 campaign\nIn the 1992 election, Bush and Quayle were challenged in their bid for reelection by the Democratic ticket of Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton and Tennessee Senator Al Gore and the independent ticket of Texas businessman Ross Perot and retired Vice Admiral James Stockdale.\n\n\nPost–vice presidency (1993–present)\nIn 1993, Quayle became the trustee of the Hudson Institute [48] From 1993 to January 1999, he served on the board of Central Newspapers, Inc., [48] and from 1995 until January 1999, he headed the Campaign America political action committee [48]\n\n\nInitial activities\nIn 1993, Quayle became the trustee of the Hudson Institute [48] From 1993 to January 1999, he served on the board of Central Newspapers, Inc., [48] and from 1995 until January 1999, he headed the Campaign America political action committee [48]\n\n\n2000 presidential campaign\nDuring a January 1999 appearance on Larry King Live, Quayle said he would run for president in 2000 [51] On January 28, 1999, he officially created an exploratory committee [48] On April 14, 1999, at a rally held at his alma mater Huntington North High School's gymnasium, Quayle officially launched his campaign for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination [48] In July 1999, he published his book Worth Fighting For [48]\n\n\nSubsequent activities\nQuayle, then working as an investment banker in Phoenix, was mentioned as a candidate for governor of Arizona before the 2002 election, [53] but declined to run.\n\n\nCerberus Capital Management\nIn 1999, Quayle joined Cerberus Capital Management, a multibillion-dollar private-equity firm, where he serves as chair of the company's Global Investments division [66] As chair of the international advisory board of Cerberus Capital Management, he recruited former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney, who would have been installed as chair if Cerberus had acquired Air Canada [67]\n\n\nPersonal life\nQuayle lives with his wife, Marilyn Quayle, in Paradise Valley, Arizona [69] They married in November 1972 [70] and have three children: Tucker, Benjamin, and Corinne [71] Benjamin Quayle served in the U.S House of Representatives from 2011 to 2013, [72] representing Arizona's 3rd congressional district [73]\n\n\nIndiana National Guard controversy\n\nSince the 1988 United States elections, Quayle has been the subject of controversy regarding his service in the Indiana National Guard from 1969 to 1975 Many of Quayle's political opponents, media outlets, and Vietnam veterans have speculated that Quayle joined the Indiana National Guard as a means to avoid the draft or to avoid being deployed to Vietnam In August 1988, Quayle denied the accusations [74] Quayle's draft controversy received renewed attention during the 1992 United States elections after Democratic nominee Bill Clinton was accused of similar draft dodging measures [75] In September 1992, Quayle acknowledged that joining the Indiana National Guard cut his risks of being deployed to Vietnam, although he defended his decision [76] In a 1992 interview with NBC's Meet the Press, Quayle was pressed on whether his main motivation was to avoid being sent to fight in Vietnam Quayle stated that he had preferences for joining the reserves, and that he never asked for preferential treatment [77] Quayle also noted that had his unit been called, he would have deployed, stating:\n\nElectoral history\n\n\nPublished material\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Qatar", "content": "\nEtymology\nPliny the Elder, a Roman writer, documented the earliest account pertaining to the inhabitants of the peninsula around the mid-first century AD, referring to them as the Catharrei, a designation that may have derived from the name of a prominent local settlement [34] [35] A century later, Ptolemy produced the first known map to depict the peninsula, referring to it as Catara [35] [36] The map also referenced a town named \"Cadara\" to the east of the peninsula [37] The term \"Catara\" (inhabitants, Cataraei) [38] was exclusively used until the 18th century, after which \"Katara\" emerged as the most commonly recognised spelling [37] Eventually, after several variations—\"Katr\", \"Kattar\" and \"Guttur\"—the modern derivative Qatar was adopted as the country's name [39] In Standard Arabic, the name is pronounced  [ˈqɑtˤɑr], while in the local dialect it is  [ˈɡɪtˤɑr] [18] English speakers use different approximate pronunciations of the name as the Arabic pronunciations use sounds not often used in English [40]\n\n\nHistory\nHuman habitation in Qatar dates back to 50,000 years ago [41] Settlements and tools dating back to the Stone Age have been unearthed in the peninsula [41] Mesopotamian artifacts originating from the Ubaid period (c 6500–3800 BC) have been discovered in abandoned coastal settlements [42] Al Da'asa, a settlement located on the western coast of Qatar, is the most important Ubaid site in the country and is believed to have accommodated a small seasonal encampment [43] [44]The polity of Dilmun, which is attested to in sources from the 3rd millennium BC onwards, is said to have encompassed Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, and the eastern portion of Saudi Arabia [45]Some historians have theorized that the Sumerians may have originated from this region [46] [47] [48]\n\n\nAntiquity\nHuman habitation in Qatar dates back to 50,000 years ago [41] Settlements and tools dating back to the Stone Age have been

originated from this region [46] [47] [48]\n\n\nEarly and late Islamic period (661–1783)\nQatar was described as a famous horse and camel breeding centre during the Umayyad period [60] In the 8th century, it started benefiting from its commercially strategic position in the Persian Gulf and went on to become a centre of pearl trading [61] [62]\nSubstantial development in the pearling industry around the Qatari Peninsula occurred during the Abbasid era [60] Ships voyaging from Basra to India and China would make stops in Qatar's ports during this period Chinese porcelain, West African coins, and artefacts from Thailand have been discovered in Qatar [59] Archaeological remains from the 9th century suggest that Qatar's inhabitants used greater wealth to construct higher quality homes and public buildings Over 100 stone-built houses, two mosques, and an Abbasid fort were constructed in Murwab during this period [63] [64] When the caliphate's prosperity declined in Iraq, so too did it in Qatar [65]\nQatar is mentioned in 13th-century Muslim scholar Yaqut al-Hamawi's book, Mu'jam Al-Buldan, which alludes to the Qataris' fine striped woven cloaks and their skills in improvement and finishing of spears [66]\n\n\nPortuguese era\nAfter the fall of the Jabrid Dynasty with the conquest of Bahrain by the Portuguese, the Arabian coast up to Al Hassa came under the rule and influence of the Portuguese empire Attempts by the Ottomans to dominate the region were eliminated with the reconquest of the castle of Tarout [71] or Al Qatif in 1551.\n\n\nBahraini and Saudi rule (1783–1868)\nIn 1766, members of the Al Khalifa family of the Utub tribal confederation migrated from Kuwait to Zubarah in Qatar [75] [76] By the time of their arrival, the Bani Khalid exercised weak authority over the peninsula, notwithstanding the fact that the largest village was ruled by their distant kin [77] In 1783, Qatar-based Bani Utbah clans and allied Arab tribes invaded and annexed Bahrain from the Persians The Al Khalifa imposed their authority over Bahrain and retained their jurisdiction over Zubarah [75]\n\n\nOttoman period (1871–1915)\nUnder military and political pressure from the governor of the Ottoman Vilayet of Baghdad, Midhat Pasha, the ruling Al Thani tribe submitted to Ottoman rule in 1871 [84] The Ottoman government imposed reformist (Tanzimat) measures concerning taxation and land registration to fully integrate these areas into the empire [84] Despite the disapproval of local tribes, Al Thani continued supporting the Ottoman rule Qatari-Ottoman relations stagnated, and in 1882 they suffered further setbacks when the Ottomans refused to aid Al Thani in his expedition of Abu Dhabi-occupied Khor Al Adaid and offered only limited support in the Qatari–Abu Dhabi War, mainly due to fear of British intervention on Abu Dhabi's side [85] In addition, the Ottomans supported the Ottoman subject Mohammed bin Abdul Wahab who attempted to supplant Al Thani as kaymakam of Qatar in 1888 [86] This eventually led Al Thani to rebel against the Ottomans, whom he believed were seeking to usurp control of the peninsula He resigned as kaymakam and stopped paying taxes in August 1892 [87]\n\n\nBritish period (1916–1971)\nBy the Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913, the Ottomans agreed to renounce their claim to Qatar and withdraw their garrison from Doha However, with the outbreak of World War I, nothing was done to carry this out, and the garrison remained in the fort at Doha, although its numbers dwindled as men deserted In 1915, with the presence of British gunboats in the harbour, Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani (who was pro-British) persuaded the remainder to abandon the fort, and when British troops approached the following morning they found it deserted [90] [91]\n\n\nIndependence and later (1971–2000)\nUnder an agreement with the United Kingdom, [96] [97] on 3 September 1971, the \"special treaty arrangements\" that were \"inconsistent with full international responsibility as a sovereign and independent state\" were terminated [97]\n\n\n21st century\nQatar's economy and status as a regional power rapidly grew in the 2000s According to the UN, the nation's economic growth, measured by GDP, was the fastest in the world during this decade [100] [101] The basis of this growth lay in the exploitation of natural gas in the North Field during the 1990s At the same time, the population tripled between 2001 and 2011, mostly from an influx of foreigners [102]\n\n\nPolitics\nQatar is officially a semi-constitutional monarchy, [111] [112] but the wide powers retained by the monarchy have it bordering an absolute monarchy [113] [114] ruled by the Al Thani family [115] [116] The Al Thani dynasty has been ruling Qatar since the family house was established in 1825 [2] In 2003, Qatar adopted a constitution that provided for the direct election of 30 of the 45 members of a legislature [2] [117] [118] The constitution was overwhelmingly approved in a referendum, with almost 98% in favour [119] [120] Despite this, the government remains authoritarian [121] [6] According to the V-Dem Democracy indices Qatar is 2023 the second least electoral democratic country in the Middle East [122] Qatari law does not permit the establishment of political bodies or trade unions [123]\n\n\nLaw\nAccording to Qatar's Constitution, Sharia law is the main source of Qatari legislation, [129] [130] although in practice Qatar's legal system is a mixture of civil law and Sharia [131] [132] Sharia is applied to family law, inheritance, and several criminal acts (including adultery, robbery, and murder) In some cases, Sharia-based family courts treat a female's testimony as being worth half that of a man [133] Codified family law was introduced in 2006 Islamic polygyny is permitted [99]\n\n\nForeign relations\nQatar's international profile and active role in international affairs have led some analysts to identify it as a middle power Since 2022, it has been a major non-NATO ally of the United States [148] Qatar also has particularly strong ties with France, [149] China, [150] Iran, [151] Turkey, [152] as well as a number of Islamist movements in the Middle East such as the Muslim Brotherhood [153] [154] [155] The country is an early member of OPEC and a founding member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, as well as a member of the Arab League [2] Diplomatic missions to Qatar are based in its capital, Doha.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Qatar Armed Forces consist of 12,000 personnel in the Qatari Emiri Land Forces, 2,500 in the Navy, 2,000 in the Air Force, and 5,000 in the Internal Security Forces [177] In 2008 Qatar spent US$2.3 billion on its military, which was 2.3% of the GDP, [178] and its military spending increased to US$7.49 billion as of 2022 [177] After the Arab spring events in 2011 and a diplomatic incident with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries in 2014, Qatar started expanding its armed forces [179] The country introduced conscription in 2013, the first Gulf state to do so in recent years It is mandatory for Qatari male citizens to serve for up to 4 months, though not all of them are called up The national service term was extended to one year in 2018 About 2,000 conscripts pass through the Qatar Armed Forces annually Military service has become more popular in Qatar due to the recent tensions with Saudi Arabia and the UAE [180] [181] Since 2017, Qatar has also purchased large quantities of equipment from European countries and the United States, making its air force one of the largest among the Gulf states [177] [179]\n\n\nHuman rights\nQatar's human rights record has been regarded by academics and non-governmental organisations as being generally poor, with restrictions on civil liberties such as the freedoms of association, expression and the press, as well as its treatment of thousands of migrant workers amounting to forced labour for projects in the country [189] [190]\n\n\nTerror\nQatar has been criticized for allowing terror financiers to operate within its borders, with accusations originating from intelligence reports, government officials, and journalists In 2014, U.S officials, including David S Cohen, claimed that Qatar had failed to take action against blacklisted individuals living freely in the country Despite introducing anti-terrorism laws in 2004 and updating them in subsequent years, Qatar faced allegations of supporting groups like Hamas, which it denied, stating its goal was to facilitate constructive engagement with the Palestinian Authority These concerns contributed to the Qatar diplomatic crisis from 2017 to 2021 [207] [208] [209]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nQatar is divided into eight municipalities (Arabic: baladiyah) [210]\n\n\nFormer municipalities\nThe Qatari peninsula protrudes 160 kilometres (100 mi) into the Persian Gulf, north of Saudi Arabia It lies between latitudes 24° and 27° N, and longitudes 50° and 52° E Most of the country consists of a low, barren plain, covered with sand To the southeast lies the Khor al Adaid (\"Inland Sea\"), an area of rolling sand dunes surrounding an inlet of the Persian Gulf.\n\n\nGeography\nThe Qatari peninsula protrudes 160 kilometres (100 mi) into the Persian Gulf, north of Saudi Arabia It lies between latitudes 24° and 27° N, and longitudes

Persian Gulf.\n\n\nBiodiversity\nQatar became part of the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity in 1996 [215] It subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan in 2005 [216] A total of 142 fungal species have been recorded from Qatar [217] A book recently produced by the Ministry of Environment documents the lizards known or believed to occur in Qatar, based on surveys conducted by an international team of scientists and other collaborators [218]\n\n\nClimate\nBefore the discovery of oil, the economy focused on fishing and pearl hunting A report prepared by local governors of the Ottoman Empire in 1892 states that income from pearl hunting in 1892 is 2,450,000 kran [81] After the introduction of the Japanese cultured pearl onto the world market in the 1920s and 1930s, Qatar's pearling industry crashed Oil was discovered in Qatar in 1940, in Dukhan Field [221] The discovery transformed the state's economy Now, the country has a high standard of living for its legal citizens With no income tax, Qatar (along with Bahrain) is one of the countries with the lowest tax rates in the world The unemployment rate in June 2013 was 0.1% [222] Corporate law mandates that Qatari nationals must hold 51% of any venture in the emirate [99] Trade and industry is overseen by the Ministry of Business and Trade [223]\n\n\nEconomy\nBefore the discovery of oil,

Ministry of Business and Trade [223]\n\n\nEnergy\nAs of 2012 [update], Qatar has proven oil reserves of 15 billion barrels and gas fields that account for more than 13% of the global resource The economy was in a downturn from 1982 to 1989 OPEC quotas on crude oil production, the lower price for oil, and the generally unpromising outlook on international markets reduced oil earnings In turn, the Qatari government's spending plans had to be cut to match lower income The resulting recessionary local business climate caused many firms to lay off expatriate staff With the economy recovering in the 1990s, expatriate populations, particularly from Egypt and South Asia, have grown again [citation needed]\n\n\nTourism\nQatar is one of the fastest growing countries in the field of tourism According to the World Tourism rankings, more than 2.3 million international tourists visited in 2017 Qatar has become one of the most open countries in the Middle East due to its recent visa facilitation improvements, including allowing nationals of 88 countries to enter visa-free and free-of charge [243] Qatar was recently put in the top eight in market climate in the Middle East by the Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Survey 2019 of the World Economic Forum [244] [245]\nDoha is one of the fastest-growing hotel and hospitality markets in the world The $220 billion spent on infrastructure since the successful World Cup bid of 2010 has helped boost the industry Hotels have also been helped by the country’s geographic location The tourism sector continues to witness a strong recovery with more than 729,000 international visitors in the first half of 2022, marking a 19% increase compared to the full year of 2021, and the aim is to raise tourism to 12% of GDP by 2030 [246]\n\n\nTransport\nIn 2008 the public works authority (Ashghal), one of the bodies that oversees infrastructure development, underwent a major reorganisation in order to streamline and modernise the authority in preparation for major project expansions across all segments in the near future Ashghal works in tandem with the Urban Planning and Development Authority, the body that designed the transportation master plan, instituted in March 2006 and running to 2025 [citation needed]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe number of people in Qatar fluctuates considerably depending on the season, since the country relies heavily on migrant labour In early 2017, the population was 2.6 million, with foreigners making up a vast majority Only 313,000 (12%) were Qatari citizens, while the remaining 2.3 million were expatriates [21]\n\n\nReligion\nIslam is the predominant religion and is the state religion although not the only religion practiced in the country, [261] and the constitution guarantees freedom to practise any faith within \"moral\" bounds [262] Most citizens belong to the Salafi Muslim movement of Wahhabism, [263] [264] [265] and 5–15% of Muslims follow Shia Islam with other Islamic sects being very small in number [266] In 2010, Qatar's population was 67.7% Muslim, 13.8% Christian, 13.8% Hindu, and 3.1% Buddhist; other religions and religiously unaffiliated people accounted for the remaining 1.6% [267]\n\n\nLanguages\nArabic is the official language, with Qatari Arabic the local dialect Qatari Sign Language is the language of the deaf community English is commonly used as a second language, [277] and a rising lingua franca, especially in commerce, to the extent that steps are being taken to try to preserve Arabic from English's encroachment [278] English is particularly useful for communication with Qatar's large expatriate community In the medical community, and in situations such as the training of nurses to work in Qatar, English acts as a lingua franca [279] Reflecting the multicultural make-up of the country, many other languages are also spoken, including Malayalam, Persian, Baluchi, Brahui, Hindi, Urdu, Pashto, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Nepali, Sinhalese, Bengali, Tagalog, Tulu and Indonesian [280]\n\n\nHealthcare\nHealthcare standards are generally high Qatari citizens are covered by a national health-insurance plan, while expatriates must either receive health insurance from their employers, or in the case of the self-employed, purchase insurance [281] Government healthcare spending is among the highest in the Middle East, with $4.7 billion being invested in healthcare in 2014 [282] This was a $2.1 billion increase from 2010 [283] The premier healthcare provider is Hamad Medical Corporation, established by the government as a non-profit healthcare provider, which runs a network of hospitals, ambulance services, and a home healthcare service, all of which are accredited by the Joint Commission [citation needed]\n\n\nCulture\nThe culture of Qatar is similar to other countries in Eastern Arabia, being significantly influenced by Islam Qatar National Day, hosted annually on 18 December, has had an important role in developing a sense of national identity [290] It is observed in remembrance of Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani's succession to the throne and his subsequent unification of the country's various tribes [291] [292]\n\n\nArts\nQatari officials, especially the Al Thani family and the sister of the Emir of Qatar, Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, pay special attention to art [293] [294] Al-Mayassa leads the Qatar Museums Authority The Museum of Islamic Art, opened in 2008, is regarded as one of the best museums in the region [295] This and several other Qatari museums, like the Arab Museum of Modern Art, fall under the Qatar Museums Authority, [296] which also sponsors artistic events abroad, such as major exhibitions by Takahashi Murakami in Versailles (2010) and Damien Hirst in London (2012).\n\n\nLiterature\nQatari literature traces its origins back to the 19th century Originally, written poetry was the most common form of expression Abdul Jalil Al-Tabatabai and Mohammed bin Abdullah bin Uthaymeen, two poets dating back to the early 19th century, formed the corpus of Qatar's earliest written poetry Poetry later fell out of favor after Qatar began reaping the profits from oil exports in the mid-20th century and many Qataris abandoned their Bedouin traditions in favor of more urban lifestyles [299]\n\n\nMedia\nQatar's media was classified as \"not free\" in the 2014 Freedom of the Press report by Freedom House [301] TV broadcasting was started in 1970 [302] Al Jazeera is a main television network headquartered in Doha Al Jazeera initially launched in 1996 as an Arabic news and current affairs satellite TV channel of the same name and has since expanded into a global network of several speciality TV channels.\n\n\nMusic\nThe music of Qatar is based on Bedouin poetry, song and dance Traditional dances in Doha are performed on Friday afternoons; one such dance is the Ardah, a stylised martial dance performed by two rows of dancers who are accompanied by an array of percussion instruments, including al-ras (a large drum whose leather is heated by an open fire), tambourines and cymbals with small drums [309] Other percussion instruments used in folk music include galahs (a tall clay jar) and tin drinking cups known as tus or tasat, usually used in conjunction with a tabl, a longitudinal drum beaten with a stick [310] String instruments, such as the oud and rebaba, are also commonly used [309]\n\n\nSport\nAssociation football is the most popular sport in Qatar, both in terms of players and spectators [311] Shortly after the Qatar Football Association became affiliated with FIFA in 1970, one of the country's earliest international accolades came in 1981 when the Qatar national under-20 team's emerged as runners-up to West Germany in that year's edition of the FIFA World Youth Championship after being defeated 4–0 in the final At the senior level, Qatar has played host to three editions of the AFC Asian Cup; the first being the ninth edition in 1988, the second being the fifteenth edition held in 2011, and the third being the eighteenth edition held in 2023 [312] For the first time in the

"en", "article": "Qatar is a country located in the Middle East, bordering the Persian Gulf. It is a semi-constitutional monarchy, with the Al Thani family ruling the country since 1825. The country has a population of approximately 2.6 million people, with foreigners making up a vast majority of the population. Qatar is known for its rich history, cultural heritage, and natural resources, particularly oil and gas.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"Qatar\" is derived from the name of a local settlement, which was referred to as \"Catara\" by the ancient Romans. The term \"Catara\" was used until the 18th century, after which it was replaced by \"Katara.\" The modern spelling \"Qatar\" was adopted in the 19th century. In Standard Arabic, the name is pronounced  [ˈqɑtˤɑr], while in the local dialect it is pronounced  [ˈɡɪtˤɑr].\n\n**History**\n\nHuman habitation in Qatar dates back to 50,000 years ago. Settlements and tools dating back to the Stone Age have been unearthed in the peninsula. Mesopotamian artifacts originating from the Ubaid period (c 6500–3800 BC) have been discovered in abandoned coastal settlements. Al Da'asa, a settlement located on the western coast of Qatar, is the most important Ubaid site in the country.\n\nThe polity of Dilmun, which is attested to in sources from the 3rd millennium BC onwards, is said to have encompassed Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, and the eastern portion of Saudi Arabia. Some historians have theorized that the Sumerians may have originated from this region.\n\n**Early and Late Islamic Period (661–1783)**\n\nQatar was described as a famous horse and camel breeding centre during the Umayyad period. In the 8th century, it started benefiting from its commercially strategic position in the Persian Gulf and went on to become a centre of pearl trading. Substantial development in the pearling industry occurred during the Abbasid era. Ships voyaging from Basra to India and China would make stops in Qatar's ports during this period.\n\n**Portuguese Era**\n\nAfter the fall of the Jabrid Dynasty with the conquest of Bahrain by the Portuguese, the Arabian coast up to Al Hassa came under the rule and influence of the Portuguese empire. Attempts by the Ottomans to dominate the region were eliminated with the reconquest of the castle of Tarout or Al Qatif in 1551.\n\n**Bahraini and Saudi Rule (1783–1868)**\n\nIn 1766, members of the Al Khalifa family of the Utub tribal confederation migrated from Kuwait to Zubarah in Qatar. By the time of their arrival, the Bani Khalid exercised weak authority over the peninsula. In 1783, Qatar-based Bani Utbah clans and allied Arab tribes invaded and annexed Bahrain from the Persians. The Al Khalifa imposed their authority over Bahrain and retained their jurisdiction over Zubarah.\n\n**Ottoman Period (1871–1915)**\n\nUnder military and political pressure from the governor of the Ottoman Vilayet of Baghdad, Midhat Pasha, the ruling Al Thani tribe submitted to Ottoman rule in 1871. The Ottoman government imposed reformist (Tanzimat) measures concerning taxation and land registration to fully integrate these areas into the empire. Despite the disapproval of local tribes, Al Thani continued supporting the Ottoman rule.\n\n**British Period (1916–1971)**\n\nBy the Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913, the Ottomans agreed to renounce their claim to Qatar and withdraw their garrison from Doha. However, with the outbreak of World War I, nothing was done to carry this out, and the garrison remained in the fort at Doha. In 1915, with the presence of British gunboats in the harbour, Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani persuaded the remainder to abandon the fort, and when British troops approached the following morning they found it deserted.\n\n**Independence and Later (1971–2000)**\n\nUnder an agreement with the United Kingdom, on 3 September 1971, the \"special treaty arrangements\" that were \"inconsistent with full international responsibility as a sovereign and independent state\" were terminated.\n\n**21st Century**\n\nQatar's economy and status as a regional power rapidly grew in the 2000s. According to the UN, the nation's economic growth, measured by GDP, was the fastest in the world during this decade. The basis of this growth lay in the exploitation of natural gas in the North Field during the 1990s.\n\n**Politics**\n\nQatar is officially a semi-constitutional monarchy, but the wide powers retained by the monarchy have it bordering an absolute monarchy. The Al Thani dynasty has been ruling Qatar since the family house was established in 1825. In 2003, Qatar adopted a constitution that provided for the direct election of 30 of the 45 members of a legislature. Despite this, the government remains authoritarian.\n\n**Law**\n\nAccording to Qatar's Constitution, Sharia law is the main source of Qatari legislation. In practice, Qatar's legal system is a mixture of civil law and Sharia. Sharia is applied to family law, inheritance, and several criminal acts. In some cases, Sharia-based family courts treat a female's testimony as being worth half that of a male.\n\n**Foreign Relations**\n\nQatar's international profile and active role in international affairs have led some analysts to identify it as a middle power. Since 2022, it has been a major non-NATO ally of the United States. Qatar also has particularly strong ties with France, China, Iran, Turkey, and a number of Islamist movements in the Middle East.\n\n**Military**\n\nThe Qatar Armed Forces consist of 12,000 personnel in the Qatari Emiri Land Forces, 2,500 in the Navy, 2,000 in the Air Force, and 5,000 in the Internal Security Forces. In 2008 Qatar spent US$2.3 billion on its military, which was 2.3% of the GDP, and its military spending increased to US$7.49 billion as of 2022.\n\n**Human Rights**\n\nQatar's human rights record has been regarded by academics and non-governmental organisations as being generally poor, with restrictions on civil liberties such as the freedoms of association, expression, and the press. The treatment of thousands of migrant workers in the country has also been a subject of criticism, with allegations of forced labour amounting to being treated as slaves.\n\n**Terror**\n\nQatar has been criticized for allowing terror financiers to operate within its borders. Intelligence reports, government officials, and journalists have accused the country of failing to take action against blacklisted individuals living freely in Qatar. Despite introducing anti-terrorism laws in 2004 and updating them in subsequent years, Qatar faced allegations of supporting groups like Hamas, which it denied, stating its goal was to facilitate constructive engagement with the Palestinian Authority.\n\n**Administrative Divisions**\n\nQatar is divided into eight municipalities.\n\n**Geography**\n\nThe Qatari peninsula protrudes 160 kilometres (100 miles) into the Persian Gulf, north of Saudi Arabia. Most of the country consists of a low, barren plain, covered with sand. To the southeast lies the Khor al Adaid (\"Inland Sea\"), an area of rolling sand dunes surrounding an inlet of the Persian Gulf.\n\n**Biodiversity**\n\nQatar became part of the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity in 1996. A total of 142 fungal species have been recorded from Qatar. A book recently produced by the Ministry of Environment documents the lizards known or believed to occur in Qatar, based on surveys conducted by an international team of scientists and other collaborators.\n\n**Climate**\n\nBefore the discovery of oil, the economy focused on fishing and pearl hunting. A report prepared by local governors of the Ottoman Empire in 1892 states that income from pearl hunting in 1892 is 2,450,000 kran. After the introduction of the Japanese cultured pearl onto the world market in the 1920s and 1930s, Qatar's pearling industry crashed.\n\n**Economy**\n\nBefore the discovery of oil, the economy focused on fishing and pearl hunting. Oil was discovered in Qatar in 1940, in Dukhan Field. The discovery transformed the state's economy. Now, the country has a high standard of living for its legal citizens. With no income tax, Qatar (along with Bahrain) is one of the countries with the lowest tax rates in the world.\n\n**Energy**\n\nAs of 2012, Qatar has proven oil reserves of 15 billion barrels and gas fields that account for more than 13% of the global resource. The economy was in a downturn from 1982 to 1989. OPEC quotas on crude oil production, the lower price for oil, and the generally unpromising outlook on international markets reduced oil earnings.\n\n**Tourism**\n\nQatar is one of the fastest-growing countries in the field of tourism. According to the World Tourism rankings, more than 2.3 million international tourists visited in 2017. Qatar has become one of the most open countries in the Middle East due to its recent visa facilitation improvements.\n\n**Transport**\n\nIn 2008 the public works authority (Ashghal), one of the bodies that oversees infrastructure development, underwent a major reorganisation in order to streamline and modernise the authority in preparation for major project expansions across all segments in the near future.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nThe number of people in Qatar fluctuates considerably depending on the season, since the country relies heavily on migrant labour. In early 2017, the population was 2.6 million, with foreigners making up a vast majority. Only 313,000 (12%) were Qatari citizens, while the remaining 2.3 million were expatriates.\n\n**Religion**\n\nIslam is the predominant religion and is the state religion, although not the only religion practiced in the country. Most citizens belong to the Salafi Muslim movement of Wahhabism, while 5–15% of Muslims follow Shia Islam with other Islamic sects being very small in number.\n\n**Languages**\n\nArabic is the official language, with Qatari Arabic the local dialect. Qatari Sign Language is the language of the deaf community. English is commonly used as a second language, and a rising lingua franca, especially in commerce, to the extent that steps are being taken to try to preserve Arabic from English's encroachment.\n\n**Healthcare**\n\nHealthcare standards are generally high. Qatari citizens are covered by a national health-insurance plan, while expatriates must either receive health insurance from their employers, or in the case of the self-employed, purchase insurance. Government healthcare spending is among the highest in the Middle East.\n\n**Culture**\n\nThe culture of Qatar is similar to other countries in Eastern Arabia, being significantly influenced by Islam. Qatar National Day, hosted annually on 18 December, has had an important role in developing a sense of national identity. It is observed in remembrance of Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani's succession to the throne and his subsequent unification of the country's various tribes.\n\n**Arts**\n\nQatari officials, especially the Al Thani family and the sister of the Emir of Qatar, Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, pay special attention to art. Al-Mayassa leads the Qatar Museums Authority. The Museum of Islamic Art, opened in 2008, is regarded as one of the best museums in the region.\n\n**Literature**\n\nQatari literature traces its origins back to the 19th century. Originally, written poetry was the most common form of expression. Abdul Jalil Al-Tabatabai and Mohammed bin Abdullah bin Uthaymeen, two poets dating back to the early 19th century, formed the corpus of Qatar's earliest written poetry.\n\n**Media**\n\nQatar's media was classified as \"not free\" in the 2014 Freedom of the Press report by Freedom House. TV broadcasting was started in 1970. Al Jazeera is a main television network headquartered in Doha.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe music of Qatar is based on Bedouin poetry, song, and dance. Traditional dances in Doha are performed on Friday afternoons. One such dance is the Ardah, a stylised martial dance performed by two rows of dancers who are accompanied by an array of percussion instruments.\n\n**Sport**\n\nAssociation football is the most popular sport in Qatar, both in terms of players and spectators. The Qatar national football team won the AFC Asian Cup in 2019, beating Japan 3–1 in the final. They retained their title in the 2023 edition, defeating Jordan in the final.\n\n**Education**\n\nQatar hired the RAND Corporation to reform its K–12 education system. Through Qatar Foundation, the country has built Education City, a campus that hosts local branches of the Weill Cornell Medical College, Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science, Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, Northwestern's Medill School of Journalism, Texas A&M's School of Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts, and other Western institutions.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Qatar\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nPliny the Elder, a Roman writer, documented the earliest account pertaining to the inhabitants of the peninsula around the mid-first century AD, referring to them as the Catharrei, a designation that may have derived from the name of a prominent local settlement [34] [35] A century later, Ptolemy produced the first known map to depict the peninsula, referring to it as Catara [35] [36] The map also referenced a town named \"Cadara\" to the east of the peninsula [37] The term \"Catara\" (inhabitants, Cataraei) [38] was exclusively used until the 18th century, after which \"Katara\" emerged as the most commonly recognised spelling [37] Eventually, after several variations—\"Katr\", \"Kattar\" and \"Guttur\"—the modern derivative Qatar was adopted as the country's name [39] In Standard Arabic, the name is pronounced  [ˈqɑtˤɑr], while in the local dialect it is  [ˈɡɪtˤɑr] [18] English speakers use different approximate pronunciations of the name as the Arabic pronunciations use sounds not often used in English [40]\n\n\nHistory\nHuman

century suggest that Qatar's inhabitants used greater wealth to construct higher quality homes and public buildings Over 100 stone-built houses, two mosques, and an Abbasid fort were constructed in Murwab during this period [63] [64] When the caliphate's prosperity declined in Iraq, so too did it in Qatar [65]\nQatar is mentioned in 13th-century Muslim scholar Yaqut al-Hamawi's book, Mu'jam

Despite the disapproval of local tribes, Al Thani continued supporting the Ottoman rule Qatari-Ottoman relations stagnated, and in 1882 they suffered further setbacks when the Ottomans refused to aid Al Thani in his expedition of Abu Dhabi-occupied Khor Al Adaid and offered only limited support in the Qatari–Abu Dhabi War, mainly due to fear of British intervention on Abu Dhabi's side [85] In addition, the Ottomans supported the Ottoman subject Mohammed bin Abdul Wahab who attempted to supplant Al Thani as kaymakam of Qatar in 1888 [86] This eventually led Al Thani to rebel against the Ottomans, whom he believed were seeking to usurp control of the peninsula He resigned as kaymakam and stopped paying taxes in August 1892 [87]\n\n\nBritish period (1916–1971)\nBy the Anglo-Ottoman

oil production, the lower price for oil, and the generally unpromising outlook on international markets reduced oil earnings In turn, the Qatari government's spending plans had to be cut to match lower income The resulting recessionary local business climate caused many firms to lay off expatriate staff With the economy recovering in the 1990s, expatriate populations, particularly from Egypt and South Asia, have grown again [citation needed]\n\n\nTourism\nQatar is one of the fastest growing countries in the field of tourism According to the World Tourism rankings, more than 2.3 million international tourists visited in 2017 Qatar has become one of the most open countries in the Middle East due to its recent visa facilitation improvements, including allowing nationals of 88 countries

to the extent that steps are being taken to try to preserve Arabic from English's encroachment [278] English is particularly useful for communication with Qatar's large expatriate community In the medical community, and in situations such as the training of nurses to work in Qatar, English acts as a lingua franca [279] Reflecting the multicultural make-up of the country, many other languages are also spoken, including Malayalam, Persian, Baluchi, Brahui, Hindi, Urdu, Pashto, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Nepali, Sinhalese, Bengali, Tagalog, Tulu and Indonesian [280]\n\n\nHealthcare\nHealthcare standards are generally high Qatari citizens are covered by a national health-insurance plan, while expatriates must either receive health insurance from their employers, or in the case of the self-employed, purchase insurance [281] Government healthcare spending is among the highest in the Middle East, with $4.7 billion being invested in healthcare in 2014 [282] This was a $2.1 billion increase from 2010 [283] The premier healthcare provider is Hamad Medical Corporation, established by the government as a non-profit healthcare provider, which runs a network of hospitals, ambulance services, and a home healthcare service, all of which are accredited by the Joint Commission [citation needed]\n\n\nCulture\nThe culture of Qatar is similar to other countries in Eastern Arabia, being significantly influenced by Islam Qatar National Day, hosted annually on 18 December, has had an important role in developing a sense of national identity [290] It is observed in remembrance of Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani's succession to the throne and his subsequent unification of the country's various tribes [291] [292]\n\n\nArts\nQatari officials, especially the Al Thani family and the sister of the Emir of Qatar, Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, pay special attention to art [293] [294] Al-Mayassa leads the Qatar Museums Authority The Museum of Islamic Art, opened in 2008, is regarded as one of the best museums in the region [295] This and several other Qatari museums, like the Arab Museum of Modern Art, fall under the Qatar Museums Authority, [296] which also sponsors artistic events abroad, such as major exhibitions by Takahashi Murakami in Versailles (2010) and Damien Hirst in London (2012).\n\n\nLiterature\nQatari literature traces its origins back to the 19th century Originally, written poetry was the most common form of expression Abdul Jalil Al-Tabatabai and Mohammed bin Abdullah bin Uthaymeen, two poets dating back to the early 19th century, formed the corpus of Qatar's earliest written poetry Poetry later fell out of favor after Qatar began reaping the profits from oil exports in the mid-20th century and many Qataris abandoned their Bedouin traditions in favor of more urban lifestyles [299]\n\n\nMedia\nQatar's media was classified as \"not free\" in the 2014 Freedom of the Press report by Freedom House [301] TV broadcasting was started in 1970 [302] Al Jazeera is a main television network headquartered in Doha Al Jazeera initially launched in 1996 as an Arabic news and current affairs satellite TV channel of the same name and has since expanded into a global network of several speciality TV channels.\n\n\nMusic\nThe music of Qatar is based on Bedouin poetry, song and dance Traditional dances in Doha are performed on Friday afternoons; one such dance is the Ardah, a stylised martial dance performed by two rows of dancers who are accompanied by an array of percussion instruments, including al-ras (a large drum whose leather is heated by an open fire), tambourines and cymbals with small drums [309] Other percussion instruments used in folk music include galahs (a tall clay jar) and tin drinking cups known as tus or tasat, usually used in conjunction with a tabl, a longitudinal drum beaten with a stick [310] String instruments, such as the oud and rebaba, are also commonly used [309]\n\n\nSport\nAssociation football is the most popular sport in Qatar, both in terms of players and spectators [311] Shortly after the Qatar Football Association became affiliated with FIFA in 1970, one of the country's earliest international accolades came in 1981 when the Qatar national under-20 team's emerged as runners-up to West Germany in that year's edition of the FIFA World Youth Championship after being defeated 4–0 in the final At the senior level, Qatar has played host to three editions of the AFC Asian Cup; the first being the ninth edition in 1988, the second being the fifteenth edition held in 2011, and the third being the eighteenth edition held in 2023 [312] For the first time in the country's history, the Qatar national football team won the AFC Asian Cup in the 2019 edition hosted in the United Arab Emirates, beating Japan 3–1 in the final They won all seven of their matches, conceding only a single goal throughout the tournament [313] As hosts and defending champions in the following 2023 edition, Qatar successfully retained their title, defeating Jordan in the final [314]\n\n\nEducation\nQatar hired the RAND Corporation to reform its K–12 education system [228] Through Qatar Foundation, the country has built Education City, a campus that hosts local branches of the Weill Cornell Medical College, Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science, Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, Northwestern's Medill School of Journalism, Texas A&M's School of Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts and other Western institutions [228]

{"title": "Hurricane_Elsa", "content": "\nMeteorological history\nOn June 27, a tropical wave emerged off the coast of Africa and tracked quickly westward across the Atlantic Ocean The wave produced disorganized showers and thunderstorms during the next few days, before a closed and well-defined low pressure system developed by 18:00 UTC on June 30, marking the formation of a tropical depression about 1,150 mi (1,850 km) east-southeast of Barbados The potential for tropical cyclone formation within the wave was first noted by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) at 12:00 UTC on June 29, and initially given a low (less than 40%) chance of development over the next five days The 5-day chance of formation was raised to high (greater than 60%) at 06:00 UTC on June 30 [1] Later that day, after the system had moved to near the Lesser Antilles and was expected to become a tropical storm before reaching the islands, the disturbance was designated as Potential Tropical Cyclone Five at 21:00 UTC [7] However, the system became a tropical cyclone according to post-season analysis three hours before that initial advisory The depression strengthened to a tropical storm by 00:00 UTC on July 1, while about 980 mi (1,575 km) east-southeast of Barbados, and named Elsa [1] This made Elsa the earliest fifth-named Atlantic storm in recorded history, surpassing Tropical Storm Edouard of 2020 by five days; it also became only the third tropical storm on record to form so early in the season east of 50°W, after the 1933 Trinidad hurricane and Tropical Storm Bret in 2023 [8] [9]\n\n\nPreparations\nUpon designation as a potential tropical cyclone at 21:00 UTC on June 30, Tropical Storm Watches were issued for the islands of Barbados, Martinique, St Lucia, and St Vincent and the Grenadines [7] Shortly afterward, the Government of France also issued a Tropical Storm Watch for Guadeloupe [19] These were later upgraded to Tropical Storm Warnings in Barbados, Martinique, and St Lucia early on July 1 [20] On July 2, 2021, Sint Eustatius also issued a hurricane warning [21]\n\n\nLesser Antilles\nSustained winds of 74 mph (119 km/h) were recorded on Barbados, which was what prompted the operational upgrade of Elsa to a hurricane [75] Barbados' Minister of Home Affairs, Wilfred Abrahams, reported damage in the southern part of the island, with power outages, along with downed trees, flash flooding and roofs ripped from homes [76] First responders were unable to reach people, but no injuries or deaths were reported [25] Elsa was the first hurricane to impact Barbados in 66 years, the previous being Hurricane Janet in 1955 [27] More than 1,300 [77] homes were damaged, including 62 homes which were completely destroyed on the island [59] The entirety of the island lost electricity as Elsa passed to the south, with 24 electricity poles being knocked down and 74 reports of trees being uprooted [78] Elsa produced rainfall totals of up to 8 inches (200 mm) in parts of the island [79] The Queen Elizabeth Hospital sustained damage following the hurricane, with sections of its roof lifted and windows blown out [80] 20 of the 98 Flow telecommunication sites in Barbados were damaged and were offline [81] All flights from the Grantley Adams International Airport were suspended on July 3, due to the airport recovering from minor structural damage and power outages [82] At least 500 electricity pole-related fires were sparked by Elsa, including one in the Grantley Adams International Airport [83]\n\n\nGreater Antilles\nIn the Dominican Republic, strong winds caused by Elsa toppled walls in houses in southwestern Baoruco Province, resulting in two separate fatalities of a 15-year-old boy and 75-year-old woman on July 3 [59] Floods in San Cristóbal Province forced the evacuation of 100 residents [59] In Santo Domingo, waves of 12–14 feet (3.7–4.3 m) in height washed ashore debris [98] 16,001 people lost electricity across the Dominican Republic, while 51 homes were damaged by the storm [99] In San José de Ocoa Province, due to the swelling of the Nizao River, 3 houses were damaged by floods, while the communities of La Estretchura, Monte Negro, and Quitasueño were cut off [100] In Haiti, damage was relatively limited while Elsa passed close to the Tiburon Peninsula, although there was reported damage to banana and maize crops and to roofs of some structures; there were no other forms of reported significant damage to infrastructure [101]\n\n\nUnited States\nDuke Energy, the main electric company in the Tampa Bay area, stated that it had about 3,000 employees, contractors, tree specialists and support personnel ready to respond power outages Additional crews from other states were brought in by Duke [68] [67] In North Port, floodwaters continued to rise days after Elsa passed the city due to rainwater that soaked more rural northern areas draining down south towards the city This prompted city and county officials to ask citizens in flood prone areas to consider evacuation [152] This flooding forced the rescue of several people from floodwaters, after they drove their vehicles into flooded streets This prompted the State Emergency Response Team of Florida's Region 6 Strike team to return from Surfside, where they had been helping with recovery and clean up efforts following the Surfside condo collapse [153] Governor Ron DeSantis reported that no serious injuries or fatalities were recorded in the Bay area He said that damage in the state was \"less than what we thought would be reasonable\" from \"where we looked 72 hours ago\" Up to 26,000 customer were without power in the area, most of them in Hillsborough, Pinellas, and Polk counties [154]\n\n\nColombia\nOn July 2, 2021, Colombian authorities issued a warning of heavy rainfall and waves of up to three meters on the Caribbean coasts of the country This was expected before the storm headed to the Dominican Republic and Haiti

man in Fort St Jacques, Soufrière was killed during Elsa [84] In the same town, a roof caved in on an elderly couple; both required rescue [85] Power outages occurred on the island due to trees, branches, and other debris falling on power lines and poles [86] About 90% percent of all customers on the island lost electricity at some point during the hurricane [87] Local emergency services received reports of downed trees, branches, and power lines, as well as roof damage [88] A majority of damage in Saint Lucia occurred in the agricultural sector, especially involving banana crop, incurring a damage total of US$34 million [89]\n\n\nOther islands\nOn the island of Grenada, the Royal Police Force reported flooding in St Andrew and St George parishes due to Elsa [92] In the capital city of Grenada, St George's, severe flooding left a road submerged [93] A 67-year-old man sustained head injuries when a small wind turbine fell on his car in Martinique Reports of fallen trees and utility poles were received island-wide, with more than 40,000 households losing electricity [94] Although Trinidad and Tobago was not directly impacted by Elsa, severe weather from the hurricane still affected the nation, which was placed under a yellow-level adverse weather warning by the Trinidad and Tobago Meteorological Service (TTMS) As a result of heavy rainfall, a localized flood alert was also ordered for the islands The Ministry of Rural Development and Local Government released reports of downed trees and flooding across Port of Spain, Diego Martin, San Juan–Laventille, Sangre Grande, Couva–Tabaquite–Talparo, Mayaro–Rio Claro, and Siparia The Water and Sewage Authority reported that the torrential rainfall caused turbid rivers and clogging at several water treatment plants in northern Trinidad As a result, water supply was affected in Arima, El Dorado, Matura, Maracas, Tacarigua, Toco, Saint Joseph, and Valencia Numerous Caribbean Airlines flights heading to Barbados, Grenada, St Vincent, and Guyana had to be cancelled due to the inclement weather [95] During these storms produced by Elsa, more than 1,000 lightning strikes were recorded within an hour [96] In San Juan–Laventille, a retaining wall collapsed and landslides were reported Another landslide occurred in Siparia [97]\n\n\nGreater Antilles\nIn the Dominican Republic, strong winds

forced the evacuation of 100 residents [59] In Santo Domingo, waves of 12–14 feet (3.7–4.3 m) in height washed ashore debris [98] 16,001 people lost electricity across the Dominican Republic, while 51 homes were damaged by the storm [99] In San José de Ocoa Province, due to the swelling of the Nizao River, 3 houses were damaged by floods, while the communities of La Estretchura, Monte Negro, and Quitasueño were cut off [100] In Haiti, damage was relatively limited while Elsa passed close to the Tiburon Peninsula, although there was reported damage to banana and maize crops and to roofs of some structures; there were no other forms of reported significant damage to infrastructure [101]\n\n\nDominican Republic and Haiti\nIn the Dominican Republic, strong winds caused by Elsa toppled

"Hurricane Elsa\n\nHurricane Elsa was a tropical cyclone that formed in the Atlantic Ocean in June 2021. It caused significant damage and disruption across several countries in the Caribbean and the southeastern United States.\n\n# Meteorological History\n\nOn June 27, a tropical wave emerged off the coast of Africa and tracked quickly westward across the Atlantic Ocean. The wave produced disorganized showers and thunderstorms during the next few days, before a closed and well-defined low pressure system developed by 18:00 UTC on June 30, marking the formation of a tropical depression about 1,150 mi (1,850 km) east-southeast of Barbados. The potential for tropical cyclone formation within the wave was first noted by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) at 12:00 UTC on June 29, and initially given a low (less than 40%) chance of development over the next five days. The 5-day chance of formation was raised to high (greater than 60%) at 06:00 UTC on June 30. Later that day, after the system had moved to near the Lesser Antilles and was expected to become a tropical storm before reaching the islands, the disturbance was designated as Potential Tropical Cyclone Five at 21:00 UTC. However, the system became a tropical cyclone according to post-season analysis three hours before that initial advisory. The depression strengthened to a tropical storm by 00:00 UTC on July 1, while about 980 mi (1,575 km) east-southeast of Barbados, and named Elsa. This made Elsa the earliest fifth-named Atlantic storm in recorded history, surpassing Tropical Storm Edouard of 2020 by five days; it also became only the third tropical storm on record to form so early in the season east of 50°W, after the 1933 Trinidad hurricane and Tropical Storm Bret in 2023.\n\n# Preparations\n\nUpon designation as a potential tropical cyclone at 21:00 UTC on June 30, Tropical Storm Watches were issued for the islands of Barbados, Martinique, St Lucia, and St Vincent and the Grenadines. Shortly afterward, the Government of France also issued a Tropical Storm Watch for Guadeloupe. These were later upgraded to Tropical Storm Warnings in Barbados, Martinique, and St Lucia early on July 1. On July 2, 2021, Sint Eustatius also issued a hurricane warning.\n\n# Lesser Antilles\n\nSustained winds of 74 mph (119 km/h) were recorded on Barbados, which was what prompted the operational upgrade of Elsa to a hurricane. Barbados' Minister of Home Affairs, Wilfred Abrahams, reported damage in the southern part of the island, with power outages, along with downed trees, flash flooding and roofs ripped from homes. First responders were unable to reach people, but no injuries or deaths were reported. Elsa was the first hurricane to impact Barbados in 66 years, the previous being Hurricane Janet in 1955. More than 1,300 homes were damaged, including 62 homes which were completely destroyed on the island. The entirety of the island lost electricity as Elsa passed to the south, with 24 electricity poles being knocked down and 74 reports of trees being uprooted. Elsa produced rainfall totals of up to 8 inches (200 mm) in parts of the island. The Queen Elizabeth Hospital sustained damage following the hurricane, with sections of its roof lifted and windows blown out. 20 of the 98 Flow telecommunication sites in Barbados were damaged and were offline. All flights from the Grantley Adams International Airport were suspended on July 3, due to the airport recovering from minor structural damage and power outages. At least 500 electricity pole-related fires were sparked by Elsa, including one in the Grantley Adams International Airport.\n\n# Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent\n\nIn Saint Lucia, one man in Fort St Jacques, Soufrière was killed during Elsa. In the same town, a roof caved in on an elderly couple; both required rescue. Power outages occurred on the island due to trees, branches, and other debris falling on power lines and poles. About 90% of all customers on the island lost electricity at some point during the hurricane. Local emergency services received reports of downed trees, branches, and power lines, as well as roof damage. A majority of damage in Saint Lucia occurred in the agricultural sector, especially involving banana crop, incurring a damage total of US$34 million.\n\n# Other islands\n\nOn the island of Grenada, the Royal Police Force reported flooding in St Andrew and St George parishes due to Elsa. In the capital city of Grenada, St George's, severe flooding left a road submerged. A 67-year-old man sustained head injuries when a small wind turbine fell on his car in Martinique. Reports of fallen trees and utility poles were received island-wide, with more than 40,000 households losing electricity. Although Trinidad and Tobago was not directly impacted by Elsa, severe weather from the hurricane still affected the nation, which was placed under a yellow-level adverse weather warning by the Trinidad and Tobago Meteorological Service (TTMS). As a result of heavy rainfall, a localized flood alert was also ordered for the islands. The Ministry of Rural Development and Local Government released reports of downed trees and flooding across Port of Spain, Diego Martin, San Juan–Laventille, Sangre Grande, Couva–Tabaquite–Talparo, Mayaro–Rio Claro, and Siparia. The Water and Sewage Authority reported that the torrential rainfall caused turbid rivers and clogging at several water treatment plants in northern Trinidad. As a result, water supply was affected in Arima, El Dorado, Matura, Maracas, Tacarigua, Toco, Saint Joseph, and Valencia. Numerous Caribbean Airlines flights heading to Barbados, Grenada, St Vincent, and Guyana had to be cancelled due to the inclement weather. During these storms produced by Elsa, more than 1,000 lightning strikes were recorded within an hour. In San Juan–Laventille, a retaining wall collapsed and landslides were reported. Another landslide occurred in Siparia.\n\n# Greater Antilles\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, strong winds caused by Elsa toppled walls in houses in southwestern Baoruco Province, resulting in two separate fatalities of a 15-year-old boy and 75-year-old woman on July 3. Floods in San Cristóbal Province forced the evacuation of 100 residents. In Santo Domingo, waves of 12–14 feet (3.7–4.3 m) in height washed ashore debris. 16,001 people lost electricity across the Dominican Republic, while 51 homes were damaged by the storm. In San José de Ocoa Province, due to the swelling of the Nizao River, 3 houses were damaged by floods, while the communities of La Estretchura, Monte Negro, and Quitasueño were cut off. In Haiti, damage was relatively limited while Elsa passed close to the Tiburon Peninsula, although there was reported damage to banana and maize crops and to roofs of some structures; there were no other forms of reported significant damage to infrastructure.\n\n# Florida\n\nDuke Energy, the main electric company in the Tampa Bay area, stated that it had about 3,000 employees, contractors, tree specialists and support personnel ready to respond power outages. Additional crews from other states were brought in by Duke. In North Port, floodwaters continued to rise days after Elsa passed the city due to rainwater that soaked more rural northern areas draining down south towards the city.

Williams\nMarcellus Williams was born on December 30, 1968, in South Bend, Indiana At the age of five, he and his mother, along with his two brothers, moved to St Louis, Missouri [14] Growing up in a troubled and impoverished household, Williams faced early exposure to alcohol, drugs, and guns, and was subjected to violent sexual and physical abuse from family members His parents abandoned him, and criminal behavior and substance abuse were prevalent in his family [15] The defence said that after becoming a father and marrying a single mother with a daughter, Williams was profoundly affected by the death of his older brother in 1997, who had served as a father figure That same year, he burglarized a home and was incarcerated for armed robbery of a donut shop in 1998 In total, Williams had sixteen criminal convictions prior to his murder trial: second degree burglary and stealing over $150 in 1988; second degree assault in 1988; second degree burglary in 1988; two counts each of second degree burglary and stealing over $150 in 1991; first degree robbery, armed criminal action, and unlawful use of a weapon in 2000; and first degree robbery, armed criminal action, stealing a motor vehicle, and two counts of false imprisonment in 2000 [16]\n\n\nMurder\nGayle's body was discovered by her husband at her home on the evening of August 11, 1998 [17] Police arrived to the scene at around 8 p.m., officers found Gayle in a fetal position with her left side covered in blood [18] She had been stabbed up to 43 times and a large butcher’s knife was found lodged in her neck [17] [19] She also had stab wounds to her back, thigh, and two more in her neck, authorities described defensive wounds to her hands and arms including a large gash in her right elbow [18] Her purse, jacket, and her husband's Macintosh computer were stolen [18] Investigators noted in the initial police report that this came amidst a burglary spree in the neighborhood [18]\n\n\nInvestigation and trial\nIn May 1999, Gayle's family announced a $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case [20] Two individuals, Henry Cole and Laura Asaro, named Marcellus Scott Williams as the culprit Cole received a $5,000 reward for his testimony, while Asaro did not request any reward for coming forward [3] Williams had an extensive criminal record Cole volunteered that Williams had made a jailhouse confession to him when both were in jail on charges unrelated to the murder Cole had already been released before volunteering his information Williams had started serving a 20-year sentence for robbing a donut shop [21] Laura Asaro, the girlfriend of Williams at the time of the crime, gave testimony that Williams had confessed to her and detailed what had happened Asaro testified that she found a purse with Gayle's identification in Williams' car She also testified that she saw scratches on Williams' neck, blood on his shirt, and a laptop in his car Unlike Cole's deposition, which was compatible with news reports, she is said to have provided details that had not been mentioned in the public accounts of the crime [22] [23]\n\n\nDeath penalty, dates, and stays\nWilliams was held on death row at Potosi Correctional Center after his trial He maintained his innocence in the Gayle case until he accepted an Alford plea of guilty in August 2024 [24] [25] His case was appealed unsuccessfully several times He was first scheduled to be executed by lethal injection in 2015 [26] In appeals, his defense produced evidence that DNA taken from the knife at the scene revealed an unknown male profile (later revealed to belong to the male prosecutor who had handled the knife) and did not match that of Williams [26] [22] [27] Despite this, Williams was rescheduled for execution on August 22, 2017.\n\n\nInitial death sentence and appeals\nWilliams was held on death row at Potosi Correctional Center after his trial He maintained his innocence in the Gayle case until he accepted an Alford plea of guilty in August 2024 [24] [25] His case was appealed unsuccessfully several times He was first scheduled to be executed by lethal injection in 2015 [26]

did not match that of Williams [26] [22] [27] Despite this, Williams was rescheduled for execution on August 22, 2017.\n\n\n2017 execution stay\nQuestions continued to be raised as the state Supreme Court would neither hear the new DNA evidence nor stay the execution The prosecutor said they were confident about the case despite the DNA, as DNA evidence had never formed any part of the basis of the conviction [28] Gov Eric Greitens issued a last-minute stay of execution that day [26] [29] The governor initiated a Board of Inquiry to examine the new DNA evidence and other aspects of the case [30] The Board was headed by Carol E Jackson, former federal judge of the Eastern District of Missouri, and consisted of five retired federal judges to review the case [31] It subpoenaed both prosecution and defense [32] [33] The Board was also to meet with the state and defense attorneys in June 2018 Greitens resigned as governor in June 2018 The DNA evidence and new analysis did not match that of Williams (it was later revealed to belong to the prosecutor who mishandled the knife after it was seized as evidence) The Board had hearings in August 2018 Governor Mike Parson was to receive the Board's conclusion and make his decision [34]\n\n\nDissolution of Inquiry Board\nIn June 2023, Parson decided to dissolve the panel of five judges without receiving their report and lifted the stay on Williams' execution as he claimed it was time for the court to make a decision [12] Later, State Attorney General Andrew Bailey asked the state Supreme Court to set a date for Williams' execution [22] [35]\n\n\n2023 Midwest Innocence Project lawsuit\nIn August 2023, The Midwest Innocence Project filed a lawsuit, stating that the St Louis County Prosecuting Attorney is on record as stating he has convincing evidence of Williams' innocence and questioned the governors right regarding the dissolution of the inquiry board [36] [37] The Innocence Project alleged that the Missouri Attorney General's Office has a record of dismissing DNA evidence that points to an accused person's innocence [38]\n\n\n2024 motion to vacate\nOn January 27, 2024, St Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell filed a motion in the St Louis County Circuit Court, asking the Court to vacate Marcellus Williams' death sentence A 2021 Missouri law allows a prosecutor to intervene where there is information suggesting a convicted person may be innocent He cited potential \"ineffective assistance of counsel\", apparent bias in jury selection, and potential weakness of the police investigation He asked the Court for a hearing to consider the new evidence and other aspects of the investigation and trial [22] The new evidence consisted of a special prosecutor's review of the case, including the findings of 3 independent DNA experts who unanimously concluded that the male DNA on the murder weapon was not Williams' [39] Rather, it belonged to an investigator and assistant prosecuting attorney who had handled the murder weapon without wearing gloves, after it had been forensically tested [40] A hearing was scheduled for August 21, 2024, to determine his innocence [41]\n\n\nScheduled execution and hearing\nOn June 4, 2024, Williams was again scheduled to be executed on September 24, 2024 [42] On July 2, the Circuit Court of St Louis County, Missouri, scheduled a hearing for August 21, 2024, to evaluate the supposed evidence of Williams' innocence [43] On July 12, 2024, the Missouri Supreme Court ruled that his execution would move forward despite the pending lawsuit to overturn his conviction In the court's opinion overruling the motion, Justice Zel Fischer ruled that \"they do not have the procedural authority to withdraw the execution order at this time.\" [41]\n\n\nAlford plea\nOn August 21, 2024, Williams accepted a plea bargain offered by the prosecution to commute his death sentence to life in prison without the possibility of parole [26] [24] [25] The prosecutors argued in favor of Williams during the hearing, pointing out that the DNA on the murder weapon was not his and that they had duly considered this fact before offering him an Alford plea to vacate his death sentence However, the state attorney general Andrew Bailey opposed this decision and wanted the execution to move forward as scheduled [44]\n\n\nFinal appeal\nOn September 12, 2024, St Louis County Circuit Judge Bruce Hilton rejected Williams' appeal, stating that the counsel was rehashing their arguments from previous appeals, all of which had been rejected multiple times by the state and federal courts, and ordered that the execution should move forward as scheduled [46]\n\n\nExecution of Williams\nDespite pleas from the public, [7] on September 24, 2024, 55-year-old Williams was executed by lethal injection at 6 p.m CT at Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre, Missouri [7] [48] For his last meal, Williams was served chicken wings and tater tots [6] In a statement, the office of Missouri governor Mike Parson justified Williams' execution, citing among other things his prior criminal record and his alleged behavior in prison which included \"attacking other inmates and threatening correctional officers\" [49]\n\n\nSee also\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Murder of Felicia Gayle\n\n##

execution [22] [35]\n\n\n2023 Midwest Innocence Project lawsuit\nIn August 2023, The Midwest Innocence Project filed a lawsuit, stating that the St Louis County Prosecuting Attorney is on record as stating he has convincing evidence of Williams' innocence and questioned the governors right regarding the dissolution of the inquiry board [36] [37] The Innocence Project alleged that the Missouri Attorney General's Office has a record of dismissing DNA evidence that points to an accused person's innocence [38]\n\n\n2024 motion to vacate\nOn January 27, 2024, St Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell filed a motion in the St Louis County Circuit Court, asking the Court to vacate Marcellus Williams' death sentence A 2021 Missouri law allows a prosecutor to intervene where there is information suggesting a convicted person may be innocent He cited potential \"ineffective assistance of counsel\", apparent bias in jury selection, and potential weakness of the police investigation He asked the Court for a hearing to consider the new evidence and other aspects of the investigation and trial [22] The new evidence consisted of a special prosecutor's review of the case, including the findings of 3 independent DNA experts who unanimously concluded that the male DNA on the murder weapon was not Williams' [39] Rather, it belonged to an investigator and assistant prosecuting attorney who had handled the murder weapon without wearing gloves, after it had been forensically tested [40] A hearing was scheduled for August 21, 2024, to determine his innocence [41]\n\n\nScheduled execution and hearing\nOn June 4, 2024, Williams was again scheduled to be executed on September 24, 2024 [42] On July 2, the Circuit Court of St Louis County, Missouri, scheduled a hearing for August 21, 2024, to evaluate the supposed evidence of Williams' innocence [43] On July 12, 2024, the Missouri Supreme Court ruled that his execution would move forward despite the pending lawsuit to overturn his conviction In the court's opinion overruling the motion, Justice Zel Fischer ruled that \"they do not have the procedural authority to withdraw the execution order at this time.\" [41]\n\n\nAlford plea\nOn August 21, 2024, Williams accepted a plea bargain offered by the prosecution to commute his death sentence to life in prison without the possibility of parole [26] [24] [25] The prosecutors argued in favor of Williams during the hearing, pointing out that the DNA on the murder weapon was not his and that they had duly considered this fact before offering him an Alford plea to vacate his death sentence However, the state attorney general Andrew Bailey opposed this decision and wanted the execution to move forward as scheduled [44]\n\n\nFinal appeal\nOn September 12, 2024, St Louis County Circuit Judge Bruce Hilton rejected Williams' appeal, stating that the counsel was rehashing their arguments from previous appeals, all of which had been rejected multiple times by the state and federal courts, and ordered that the execution should move forward as scheduled [46]\n\n\nExecution of Williams\nDespite pleas from the public, [7] on September 24, 2024, 55-year-old Williams was executed by lethal injection at 6 p.m CT at Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre, Missouri [7] [48] For his last meal, Williams was served chicken wings and tater tots [6] In a statement, the office of Missouri governor Mike Parson justified Williams' execution, citing among other things his prior criminal record and his alleged behavior in prison which included \"attacking other inmates and threatening correctional officers\" [49]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is a highly distinctive and fascinating organism that has been the subject of interest among marine biologists and enthusiasts alike.\n\n**Taxonomy**\n\nGlaucus atlanticus is closely related to Glaucus marginatus, another species that was previously considered to be a single species. However, recent studies have revealed that Glaucus marginatus is actually a cryptic species complex consisting of four separate species that inhabit the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Glaucus atlanticus shares the common name \"blue dragon\" with Pteraeolidia ianthina and Glaucus marginatus, which is a testament to its striking appearance.\n\n**Description**\n\nAt maturity, Glaucus atlanticus typically measures around 3 cm (1.2 in) in length, although larger specimens have been found. It is a relatively long-lived species, with some individuals reported to have lived up to a year under optimal conditions. The dorsal side of the slug is silvery grey, while the ventral side is dark blue with pale blue stripes. The head of the slug features dark blue stripes, and its body is flat and tapering. It has six appendages that branch out into rayed, finger-like cerata, which are used for movement and prey capture.\n\n**Buoyancy and Coloration**\n\nGlaucus atlanticus has a unique adaptation that allows it to float at the surface of the water. A gas-filled sac in its stomach provides the necessary buoyancy, but due to the location of the sac, the slug floats upside down. The upper surface of the slug is actually the foot, which has a blue or blue-white coloration. In contrast, the true dorsal surface is completely silver-grey. This coloration is an example of countershading, which helps protect the slug from predators that might attack from below or above. The blue coloration also reflects harmful ultraviolet sunlight, which is a further adaptation to protect the slug.\n\n**Distribution and Habitat**\n\nGlaucus atlanticus is a pelagic species, meaning it is found in open ocean waters. Its distribution is widespread, with records from the east and south coasts of South Africa, European waters, the east coast of Australia, and Mozambique. Recent observations suggest that its geographical range has increased northward by 150 km in the Gulf of California compared to previous sightings. This species appears to be found in both temperate and tropical waters, making it a highly adaptable and widespread species.\n\n**Life History and Behavior**\n\nGlaucus atlanticus is a carnivorous species that preys on other larger pelagic organisms. It uses its cerata to make slow swimming movements towards its prey or mates. This species is known to prey on the dangerously venomous Portuguese man o' war (Physalia physalis), the by-the-wind-sailor (Velella velella), the blue button (Porpita porpita), and the violet snail (Janthina janthina). In captivity, individuals have been observed attacking and eating other individuals, highlighting the aggressive nature of this species.\n\n**Sting**\n\nGlaucus atlanticus has the unique ability to swallow the venomous nematocysts from siphonophores, such as the Portuguese man o' war, and store them in the extremities of its finger-like cerata. This adaptation allows it to use the venom as a defense mechanism. When handled, the slug can inflict a painful sting, with symptoms similar to those caused by the Portuguese man o' war. The symptoms of a sting can include nausea, pain, vomiting, acute allergic contact dermatitis, erythema, urticarial papules, potential vesicle formation, and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGlaucus atlanticus is a fascinating and highly distinctive species of sea slug that has captivated the imagination of marine biologists and enthusiasts alike. Its unique adaptations, such as its ability to float at the surface and its venomous sting, make it a remarkable organism. Further research into its behavior, distribution, and ecology is necessary to fully understand this species and its place within the marine ecosystem.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Glaucus_atlanticus\" following this outline:\n\n\nTaxonomy\nThis species looks similar to, and is closely related to, G marginatus, which is now understood to be not one species, but a cryptic species complex of four separate species that live in the Indian and Pacific Oceans [1] [3] It shares the common name \"blue dragon\" with Pteraeolidia ianthina [4] and G marginatus [5]\n\n\nDescription\nAt maturity, G atlanticus is usually around 3 cm (1.2 in) in length, [6] though larger specimens have been found [7] It can live up to a year under the right conditions [8] It is silvery grey on its dorsal side and dark and pale blue ventrally It has dark blue stripes on its head It has a flat, tapering body and six appendages that branch out into rayed, finger-like cerata [9]\n\n\nBuoyancy and coloration\nWith the aid of a gas-filled sac in its stomach, G atlanticus floats at the surface Due to the location of the gas sac, this species floats upside down The upper surface is actually the foot (the underside in other slugs and snails), and this has either a blue or blue-white coloration The true dorsal surface (carried downwards in G atlanticus) is completely silver-grey This coloration is an example of countershading, which helps protect it from predators that might attack from below and from above [15] The blue coloration is also thought to reflect harmful ultraviolet sunlight.\n\n\nDistribution and habitat\nThis nudibranch is pelagic, and some evidence indicates that it occurs throughout the world's oceans, in temperate and tropical waters It has been recorded from the east and south coasts of South Africa, European waters, the east coast of Australia, and Mozambique [3] Observations in 2015 and 2016 suggested that the G atlanticus species' geographical range had increased northward by 150 km in the Gulf of California compared with previous sightings [16]\n\n\nLife history and behavior\nG atlanticus preys on other larger pelagic organisms The sea slugs can move toward prey or mates by using their cerata, the thin feather-like \"fingers\" on its body, to make slow swimming movements [10] [22] They are known to prey on the dangerously venomous Portuguese man o' war (Physalia physalis), the by-the-wind-sailor (Velella velella), the blue button (Porpita porpita), and the violet snail, Janthina janthina Occasionally, individuals attack and eat other individuals in captivity.\n\n\nSting\nG atlanticus can swallow the venomous nematocysts from siphonophores, such as the Portuguese man o' war, and store them in the extremities of its finger-like cerata [24] Picking up the animal can result in a painful sting, with symptoms similar to those caused by the Portuguese man o' war [26] The symptoms that may appear after being stung are nausea, pain, vomiting, acute allergic contact dermatitis, erythema, urticarial papules, potential vesicle formation and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation [13]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
