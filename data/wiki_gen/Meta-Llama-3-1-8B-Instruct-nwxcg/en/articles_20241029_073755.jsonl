Born on August 25, 1949, in Oxford, England, Amis has established himself as one of the most prominent and innovative writers of his generation.\n\n#Early life\n\nMartin Amis was born to Sir Kingsley Amis, a renowned novelist and poet, and Hilly Amis, a pianist and teacher. His father's literary influence can be seen in his writing, particularly in his exploration of the human condition and the complexities of relationships. Amis grew up in a bohemian household, surrounded by intellectuals and artists, which would later shape his literary style and interests. He attended the independent school Highgate School in North London and later matriculated at Oxford University, where he studied English literature.\n\n#Early writing\n\nAmis's early writing was heavily influenced by his father's work, particularly in the genre of satire. His first novel, _The Rachel Papers_ (1973), was a coming-of-age story that explored the complexities of adolescent relationships and the search for identity. The novel received critical acclaim and established Amis as a rising talent in the literary world. His second novel, _Dead Babies_ (1975), was a more experimental work that explored the themes of alienation and social disconnection.\n\n#Main career\n\n##1980s and 1990s\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s saw Amis's career flourish with the publication of several critically acclaimed novels. _Offshore_ (1979) was a dark comedy that explored the lives of a group of eccentric characters living on a houseboat in London. _Money: A Suicide Note_ (1984) was a satirical novel that critiqued the excesses of 1980s capitalism. _London Fields_ (1989) was a science fiction novel that explored the themes of fate and free will. _Time's Arrow_ (1991) was a unique narrative that told the story of a Nazi doctor during World War II.\n\n##2000s\n\nIn the 2000s, Amis continued to experiment with new forms and styles. _The Information_ (1995) was a novel that explored the world of online culture and the impact of technology on human relationships. _Experience_ (2000) was a collection of essays that reflected on his personal life and experiences. _The Pregnant Widow_ (2010) was a novel that explored the themes of love, relationships, and identity.\n\n##2010s and 2020s\n\nIn the 2010s and 2020s, Amis continued to write and publish new works. _Lionel Asbo: State of England_ (2012) was a satirical novel that critiqued the excesses of modern Britain. _The Zone of Interest_ (2014) was a historical novel that explored the lives of Nazi officials during World War II. _Inside Story_ (2018) was a collection of essays that reflected on his life and experiences.\n\n##Other work\n\n###University of Manchester\n\nIn addition to his literary work, Amis has also taught and lectured at several universities, including the University of Manchester. In 2004, he gave a series of lectures on the topic of \"The Art of Fiction,\" which were later published as a collection of essays.\n\n#Personal life\n\n##Death\n\nMartin Amis's mother, Hilly Amis, died in 2003. His father, Sir Kingsley Amis, died in 1995. Amis has been married twice, first to Antonia Phillips from 1982 to 1993, with whom he had three children, and then to Jacqueline Salomon in 2000. He has been a vocal critic of the National Health Service and has expressed his support for the legalization of euthanasia.\n\n#Views\n\n##Writing\n\nAmis has been a vocal critic of modern writing and the publishing industry. He has argued that the rise of digital media and online culture has led to a decline in traditional literary values and a homogenization of style. He has also been critical of the trend towards \"high concept\" novels, which he sees as shallow and lacking in depth.\n\n##Nuclear proliferation\n\nAmis has been a vocal critic of nuclear proliferation and has argued that the threat of nuclear war is a major concern for humanity. He has written extensively on the topic and has been a vocal advocate for disarmament.\n\n##Geopolitics\n\nAmis has written extensively on geopolitics and the complexities of international relations. He has argued that the rise of China and the decline of Western influence are significant challenges for the global order.\n\n##Electoral politics\n\nAmis has been a vocal critic of electoral politics and the rise of populism. He has argued that the trend towards nationalist and authoritarian politics is a threat to democracy and human rights.\n\n##Islam and Islamism\n\nAmis has written extensively on the topic of Islam and Islamism. He has argued that the rise of Islamist extremism is a major concern for global security and has advocated for a more nuanced understanding of the complexities of Islamic thought.\n\n##Euthanasia\n\nAmis has been a vocal advocate for the legalization of euthanasia and has argued that it is a matter of individual choice and autonomy.\n\n##Agnosticism\n\nAmis has identified as an agnostic and has argued that the pursuit of knowledge and understanding is a key aspect of human existence. He has also been critical of religious fundamentalism and the rise of dogmatic thinking.\n\n#Bibliography\n\n##Novels\n\n* _The Rachel Papers_ (1973)\n* _Dead Babies_ (1975)\n* _Success_ (1978)\n* _Offshore_ (1979)\n* _Money: A Suicide Note_ (1984)\n* _London Fields_ (1989)\n* _Time's Arrow_ (1991)\n* _The Information_ (1995)\n* _Experience_ (2000)\n* _The Pregnant Widow_ (2010)\n* _Lionel Asbo: State of England_ (2012)\n* _The Zone of Interest_ (2014)\n* _Inside Story_ (2018)\n\n##Short fiction\n\n* _The Story of My Life_ (1995)\n* _The Rubber Woman_ (1998)\n* _The Real Thing_ (2003)\n\n##Non-fiction\n\n* _Visiting the Queen_ (1996)\n* _Experience_ (2000)\n* _The Second Plane_ (2008)\n* _The Biography of a Book_ (2012)\n* _Inside Story_ (2018)\n\n##Screenplays\n\n* _This House of Pleasure_ (1989)\n* _Prick Up Your Ears_ (1987)\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of Martin Amis's life and work.

His brutal murders and sex crimes shocked the nation, and his case remains one of the most infamous in American true crime history.\n\n**Early Life**\n\n### Childhood\n\nWilliam Bonin was born on January 8, 1947, in Los Angeles, California. His early life was marked by instability and turmoil. His parents, Erwin and Lucille Bonin, were both from working-class families and struggled to make ends meet. Erwin, a laborer, had a history of infidelity and substance abuse, while Lucille worked multiple jobs to support the family. The couple's relationship was strained, and they eventually divorced when Bonin was just five years old.\n\nBonin's childhood was spent in a series of foster homes, where he was often subjected to physical and emotional abuse. He was a troubled child, frequently getting into fights and engaging in antisocial behavior. Despite his difficulties, Bonin showed a talent for music and was an accomplished guitarist.\n\n### Adolescence\n\nBonin attended Bell High School in Los Angeles, where he continued to struggle with behavioral issues. He was known for his aggressive behavior, and his grades suffered as a result. Despite his poor academic record, Bonin was a charismatic individual who had a natural charm and charisma. He was popular among his peers, who often saw him as a rebel and a free spirit.\n\n### Engagement and U.S. Air Force\n\nIn 1966, Bonin enlisted in the United States Air Force, where he served for two years. During his time in the military, Bonin was stationed in the Philippines and was involved in a series of disciplinary incidents, including a court-martial for breaking and entering. Despite his poor behavior, Bonin was honorably discharged from the Air Force in 1968.\n\n**First Convictions**\n\nBonin's first brushes with the law began in 1967, when he was arrested for grand theft auto. He was convicted of the crime and served a short sentence in jail. However, it was his second conviction, for burglary and larceny, that would set the tone for his future crimes.\n\nIn 1970, Bonin was arrested for breaking and entering and was sentenced to three years in prison. During his time inside, Bonin began to develop a fascination with sex crimes, particularly those involving children. He read extensively on the subject and began to formulate a plan to commit a series of heinous sex crimes.\n\n**Incarceration at Atascadero and Vacaville prison**\n\nBonin was transferred to Atascadero State Hospital, a facility for the mentally ill, in 1973. He spent several years there, during which time he was treated for his mental health issues and began to develop a fascination with serial killers. Bonin was particularly drawn to the case of Richard Ramirez, who was imprisoned at the time.\n\nIn 1975, Bonin was transferred to Vacaville State Prison, where he met a fellow inmate named Greg Miley. Miley, who would later become an accomplice in Bonin's crimes, was a convicted sex offender who shared Bonin's fascination with sex crimes.\n\n### Further Offenses and Imprisonment\n\nWhile incarcerated, Bonin continued to commit crimes, including a series of sex offenses against fellow inmates. He was caught on multiple occasions and was eventually sentenced to life in prison.\n\nDespite his harsh sentence, Bonin continued to commit crimes, including a series of violent assaults on fellow inmates. He was eventually transferred to a maximum-security facility, where he remained until his eventual release in 1978.\n\n**Release**\n\nBonin was released from prison in 1978, after serving seven years of a life sentence. He was given a conditional release, which required him to live in a halfway house", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"William_Bonin\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n##Childhood\n##Adolescence\n##Engagement and U.S. Air Force\n#First convictions\n#Incarceration at Atascadero and Vacaville prison\n##Further offenses and imprisonment\n#Release\n##Acquaintance with Vernon Butts and Gregory Miley\n#Murders\n##1979\n###May\n###August\n###September through December\n##1980\n###January and February\n###March\n###April\n###May\n###June\n#Arrest\n##Confession\n##Accomplices' arrest\n#Preliminary hearings\n#Murder trials\n##Los Angeles County\n###Closing arguments\n###Conviction\n###Sentencing\n##Orange County\n###Second conviction\n#Death row\n##Appeals\n#Execution\n#Aftermath\n#Known victims\n##1979\n##1980\n#Media\n##Film\n##Bibliography\n##Television\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Cited works and further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The shortage had significant impacts on families with infants, leading to concerns about access to nutritionally adequate food.\n\nCauses\n\n### Supply Chain Issues\n\nThe infant formula shortage was exacerbated by supply chain issues, which affected the production and distribution of formula across the country. Bottlenecks in the supply chain, including shortages of raw materials and components, disrupted the production of formula, leading to stockouts and shortages.\n\n### Recall and Plant Shutdown\n\nIn February 2022, the Abbott Nutrition facility in Sturgis, Michigan, was shut down due to concerns about bacterial contamination. The plant was the largest manufacturer of infant formula in the United States, producing approximately 40% of the country's formula. The shutdown led to a significant reduction in the national supply of formula.\n\n#### Alleged Problems at Sturgis Plant\n\nThe shutdown of the Sturgis plant was attributed to allegations of bacterial contamination, including Cronobacter sakazakii, a bacterium that can cause serious illness in infants. The investigation into the contamination revealed that the plant had failed to follow proper sanitation and quality control procedures.\n\n### Import Restrictions\n\nThe infant formula shortage was also exacerbated by import restrictions, which limited the ability of companies to import formula from other countries. The restrictions, which were implemented to prevent the entry of substandard formula, further reduced the national supply of formula.\n\n### Market Concentration\n\nThe infant formula market is highly concentrated, with a few large companies dominating the market. This concentration can make the industry more vulnerable to disruptions, as a single event, such as a plant shutdown, can have a significant impact on the national supply.\n\nEffects\n\n### Sale and Donation of Breast Milk\n\nThe infant formula shortage led to an increase in the sale and donation of breast milk. Some women began selling their breast milk online, while others donated it to local hospitals and charities.\n\n### Use of Alternative Foods\n\nFamilies affected by the shortage turned to alternative foods, such as cow's milk and adult formula, to feed their infants. However, these alternatives may not be nutritionally adequate for infants, and their use was not recommended by healthcare professionals.\n\n### Hospitalizations\n\nThe infant formula shortage led to an increase in hospitalizations, particularly among infants who were fed formula that was not nutritionally adequate. The hospitalizations were often due to illnesses related to malnutrition, such as diarrhea and vomiting.\n\n### Bot Usage\n\nThe shortage led to an increase in bot usage, as parents and caregivers sought guidance on how to feed their infants during the shortage. The bots provided information on alternative foods and feeding options, but they also spread misinformation and created confusion.\n\n### Shortage in Canada\n\nThe infant formula shortage also affected Canada, where families experienced similar difficulties in accessing formula.\n\nResponses\n\n### Efforts to Prevent Price Gouging\n\nRegulators and lawmakers took steps to prevent price gouging, which had become a significant concern during the shortage. Companies were prohibited from raising prices excessively, and regulators worked to ensure that prices remained fair and reasonable.\n\n### Efforts to Increase Supply\n\nCompanies and regulators worked to increase the supply of formula, including by importing formula from other countries and by increasing production at existing facilities. However, the efforts were hampered by supply chain issues and other challenges.\n\n### Efforts to Restore Production\n\nEfforts were made to restore production at the Sturgis plant, but the process was slow and complex. The plant was required to implement new quality control procedures and to meet regulatory requirements before production could resume.\n\n### Investigations\n\nSeveral investigations were launched to determine the causes of the shortage and to identify areas for improvement. The investigations included Congressional, FDA, ABC News, and DOJ investigations.\n\n#### Congressional Investigation\n\nThe Congressional investigation was led by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, which held hearings on the shortage and its causes. The investigation focused on the role of regulatory agencies, including the FDA, in preventing the shortage.\n\n#### FDA Investigation\n\nThe FDA investigation focused on the quality control procedures at the Sturgis plant and on the agency's response to the shortage. The investigation revealed that the FDA had failed to adequately inspect the plant and to address concerns about contamination.\n\n#### ABC News Investigation\n\nThe ABC News investigation examined the impact of the shortage on families and the role of companies in responding to the crisis. The investigation revealed that some companies had raised prices excessively and had failed to provide adequate support to affected families.\n\n#### DOJ Investigation\n\nThe DOJ investigation focused on allegations of price gouging and other anti-competitive practices. The investigation was ongoing at the time of the shortage, and it was expected to lead to significant consequences for companies that had engaged in such practices.\n\nCommentary\n\n### Breast Milk vs. Formula Debate\n\nThe infant formula shortage reignited the debate about breast milk vs. formula, with some arguing that breast milk was the best option for infants. Others argued that formula was a safe and adequate alternative.\n\n### Criticism of Federal Response\n\nThe federal response to the shortage was widely criticized, with some arguing that the response was inadequate and that the government had failed to take necessary steps to prevent the shortage. Others argued that the response was robust and that the government had done its best to mitigate the crisis.\n\n#### White House Response\n\nThe White House responded to the shortage by announcing measures to increase the supply of formula and to prevent price gouging. The response was widely criticized as inadequate, with some arguing that the measures did not go far enough to address the crisis.\n\n#### Formula Availability at the Southern Border\n\nThe shortage led to concerns about the availability of formula at the Southern border, where many families rely on formula as a primary source of nutrition for their infants. The shortage highlighted the need for more effective policies to address the nutritional needs of migrants and refugees.\n\nSee also\n\n* Infant formula\n* Breast milk\n* Sturgis plant\n* FDA\n* DOJ\n* ABC News\n* White House", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_United_States_infant_formula_shortage\" following this outline:\n\n#Causes\n##Supply chain issues\n##Recall and plant shutdown\n###Alleged problems at Sturgis plant\n##Import restrictions\n##Market concentration\n#Effects\n##Sale and donation of breast milk\n##Use of alternative foods\n##Hospitalizations\n##Bot usage\n##Shortage in Canada\n#Responses\n##Efforts to prevent price gouging\n##Efforts to increase supply\n##Efforts to restore production\n##Investigations\n###Congressional investigation\n###FDA investigation\n###ABC News investigation\n###DOJ investigation\n#Commentary\n##Breast milk vs. formula debate\n##Criticism of federal response\n###White House response\n###Formula availability at the Southern border\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

During his career, he swam across Lake Ontario a total of 5 times, and also completed a notable swim across the Catalina Channel. Young's swimming achievements earned him public acclaim, although he did not receive significant financial compensation.\n\nEarly swimming achievements\n\nYoung began his swimming career at a young age, with early training taking place in the waters of Lake Ontario. His talent and determination led him to focus on long-distance swimming, a discipline that would become synonymous with his name.\n\nCatalina swim training\n\nYoung traveled to California in the early 1920s to train for his Catalina Channel swim. Under the guidance of experienced coaches, he honed his skills and developed a rigorous training regimen. The grueling training sessions prepared Young for the challenges he would face in the open water.\n\nCatalina channel swim\n\nOn a sunny day in 1923, George Young set out to swim across the Catalina Channel. The swim was challenging due to the strong currents and tides. Young swam with the tides, but still faced stiff competition from fellow swimmer Norman Ross. Young's determination and stamina ultimately earned him the victory in the highly publicized swim.\n\nSwam with tides\n\nYoung's decision to swim with the tides proved to be a strategic move. The currents carried him across the channel, reducing the overall time and energy required for the swim. However, this decision also meant that Young had to contend with the strong currents, which added an extra layer of difficulty to the swim.\n\nCompetition from Norman Ross\n\nNorman Ross, a renowned swimmer at the time, posed a significant challenge to Young's Catalina Channel swim. Ross was known for his exceptional swimming skills and had previously completed multiple long-distance swims. The competition between Young and Ross added an element of excitement to the swim, with both athletes pushing each other to new heights.\n\nPublic acclaim, with limited financial gain\n\nYoung's Catalina Channel swim earned him widespread recognition and acclaim. However, despite the attention, he did not receive significant financial compensation for his achievement. The lack of financial reward was a recurring theme throughout Young's swimming career, with him often struggling to make ends meet.\n\nInconsistent swimming career\n\nAfter his Catalina Channel swim, Young continued to compete in long-distance events, but his career was marked by periods of inconsistency. He faced setbacks, injuries, and personal struggles, which affected his performance in the water.\n\n1927, 21-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nIn 1927, Young set out to swim 21 miles across Lake Ontario. The swim was a significant challenge, but Young's determination and experience ultimately led him to complete the distance.\n\n1928, 15-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nThe following year, Young returned to Lake Ontario to swim 15 miles. The swim was a testament to Young's endurance and stamina, as he navigated the open waters with ease.\n\nWins Sept 1928 Montreal to Repentigney Marathon\n\nIn September 1928, Young competed in the Montreal to Repentigney Marathon, a grueling long-distance swim. Young's experience and training paid off, as he emerged victorious in the highly competitive event.\n\n1929, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nIn 1929, Young returned to Lake Ontario to swim 15 miles. The swim was a repeat of his previous year's performance, with Young once again demonstrating his endurance and stamina.\n\n1930, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nThe following year, Young again swam 15 miles across Lake Ontario. The swim was a testament to Young's consistency and dedication to his training.\n\nWins 1931 Lake Ontario win\n\nIn 1931, Young competed in the Lake Ontario swim, a highly competitive event. Young's experience and training ultimately led him to emerge victorious.\n\nLate swim career\n\nAs the 1930s progressed, Young's swimming career began to slow down. He faced increased competition from younger athletes and struggled to maintain his previous level of performance.\n\nSwim retirement and marriage\n\nYoung eventually retired from competitive swimming, citing a desire to start a family and pursue a more stable career. In 1935, he married his wife, who would become a supportive partner throughout his life.\n\nMarriages\n\nYoung was married twice, with his first marriage ending in divorce. His second marriage, however, was a successful and long-lasting partnership.\n\nLate professional life\n\nAfter his retirement from competitive swimming, Young went on to pursue a career in business. He struggled to find success, however, and was often forced to take on menial jobs to make ends meet.\n\nHonors\n\nDespite his struggles, Young was recognized for his contributions to the sport of swimming. He was awarded numerous accolades for his achievements, including multiple awards for his long-distance swims.\n\nSee also\n\n* Long-distance swimming\n* Catalina Channel swim\n* Lake Ontario swim\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n* National Library of Canada\n* Library and Archives Canada\n* Swimming Canada", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"George_Young_(swimmer)\" following this outline:\n\n#Early swimming achievements\n##Catalina swim training\n#Catalina channel swim\n##Swam with tides\n##Competition from Norman Ross\n##Public acclaim, with limited financial gain\n#Inconsistent swimming career\n##1927, 21-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n##1928, 15-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n##Wins Sept 1928 Montreal to Repentigney Marathon\n##1929, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n##1930, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n##Wins 1931 Lake Ontario win\n##Late swim career\n#Swim retirement and marriage\n##Marriages\n#Late professional life\n#Honors\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The Acts were designed to prevent mutiny, or rebellion against authority, and to provide a framework for the punishment of those who committed such offenses.\n\nBackground\n\nThe concept of mutiny has existed throughout history, and it was a significant problem in the British Navy during the 17th and 18th centuries. The British Navy was a major power during this period, and its ships and sailors played a crucial role in the country's colonial and trade empires. However, the Navy was also subject to numerous mutinies, which threatened the stability of the fleet and the security of the nation.\n\nIn response to these mutinies, the British Parliament passed the first Mutiny Act in 1650, during the Commonwealth period. The Act made it a crime to incite or participate in a mutiny, and it established a system of courts-martial to try those accused of such offenses.\n\nPassage of the first Mutiny Act\n\nThe first Mutiny Act was passed on June 30, 1650, during the Commonwealth period, when England was a republic under the leadership of Oliver Cromwell. The Act was designed to regulate the behavior of soldiers and sailors in the British armed forces, and it established a system of discipline and punishment for those who committed offenses.\n\nThe Act made it a crime to incite or participate in a mutiny, and it established a system of courts-martial to try those accused of such offenses. The Act also provided for the punishment of those who were found guilty of mutiny, including imprisonment, flogging, and even death.\n\nRenewal of the Mutiny Acts\n\nThe Mutiny Act of 1650 was renewed and amended several times over the years. In 1661, after the Restoration of the monarchy, the Mutiny Act was revised to make it more stringent and to provide for the punishment of those who committed offenses against the crown.\n\nIn 1689, the Mutiny Act was amended to provide for the trial of those accused of mutiny by a court-martial. The Act also established the principle of \"no appeal,\" which meant that those who were found guilty of mutiny could not appeal their sentence to a higher court.\n\nThe Quartering Acts\n\nIn 1662, the British Parliament passed the Quartering Act, which provided for the billeting of soldiers in private homes. The Act was designed to provide for the housing and feeding of soldiers, but it also gave the military significant power to enter private homes and to take over property.\n\nThe Quartering Act was a major source of tension between the military and civilians, and it led to numerous complaints and protests. The Act was eventually repealed in 1698, but it remains an important part of British military history.\n\nList\n\nThe Mutiny Acts were passed and amended numerous times over the years. Here is a list of some of the key Acts and their dates:\n\n## England\n\n* 1650: The first Mutiny Act is passed on June 30, 1650.\n* 1661: The Mutiny Act is revised to make it more stringent and to provide for the punishment of those who committed offenses against the crown.\n* 1689: The Mutiny Act is amended to provide for the trial of those accused of mutiny by a court-martial.\n\n## Great Britain\n\n* 1698: The Quartering Act is repealed.\n* 1706: The Mutiny Act is amended to provide for the punishment of those who committed offenses against the crown.\n* 1770: The Mutiny Act is amended to provide for the trial of those accused of mutiny by a court-martial.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\n### 1800s\n\n* 1803: The Mutiny Act is amended to provide for the punishment of those who committed offenses against the crown.\n* 1814: The Mutiny Act is amended to provide for the trial of those accused of mutiny by a court-martial.\n\n### 1810s\n\n* 1815: The Mutiny Act is amended to provide for the punishment of those who committed offenses against the crown.\n* 1819: The Mutiny Act is amended to provide for the trial of those accused of mutiny by a court-martial.\n\n### 1820s\n\n* 1823: The Mutiny Act is amended to provide for the punishment of those who committed offenses against the crown.\n* 1829: The Mutiny Act is amended to provide for the trial of those accused of mutiny by a court-martial.\n\n### 1830s\n\n* 1830: The Mutiny Act is amended to provide for the punishment of those who committed offenses against the crown.\n* 1833: The Mutiny Act is amended to provide for the trial of those accused of mutiny by a court-martial.\n\n### 1840s\n\n* 1842: The Mutiny Act is amended to provide for the punishment of those who committed offenses against the crown.\n* 1843: The Mutiny Act is amended to provide for the trial of those accused of mutiny by a court-martial.\n\n### 1850s\n\n* 1850: The Mutiny Act is amended to provide for the punishment of those who committed offenses against the crown.\n* 1857: The Mutiny Act is amended to provide for the trial of those accused of mutiny by a court-martial.\n\n### 1860s\n\n* 1861: The Mutiny Act is amended to provide for the punishment of those who committed offenses against the crown.\n* 1863: The Mutiny Act is amended to provide for the trial of those accused of mutiny by a court-martial.\n\n### 1870s\n\n* 1870: The Mutiny Act is amended to provide for the punishment of those who committed offenses against the crown.\n* 1871: The Mutiny Act is amended to provide for the trial of those accused of mutiny by a court-martial.\n\nMarine Mutiny Acts\n\nThe Marine Mutiny Act of 1797 was a significant piece of legislation that provided for the trial of those accused of mutiny by a court-martial.

A cold front associated with the low-pressure system interacted with a mass of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, creating a volatile atmospheric environment conducive to severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. As the cold front shifted eastward, it encountered a region of strong wind shear, which contributed to the development of long-lived tornadoes.\n\n# Confirmed Tornadoes\n\n## November 4 Event\n\nThe first reports of tornadoes began emerging on the afternoon of November 4, as a powerful supercell developed over the Texas-Oklahoma border. Throughout the evening, multiple tornadoes touched down in the region, causing significant damage and injuring several people.

The tornado then crossed into Oklahoma, affecting the towns of Idabel, Broken Bow, and Eagletown, where it caused significant damage and killed several people.\n\n## Cason–Naples, Texas\n\nThe Cason–Naples, Texas tornado was a damaging EF1 tornado that affected the towns of Cason and Naples, Texas. The tornado touched down in Cason, Texas, around 7 pm on November 5, and then continued southward, causing damage in Naples, Texas.\n\n## Simms–New Boston, Texas\n\nThe Simms–New Boston, Texas tornado was a damaging EF2 tornado that affected the towns of Simms and New Boston, Texas.

The Papers of Benjamin Franklin is a comprehensive archive of his papers, comprising letters, essays, speeches, and other documents that provide valuable insights into his thoughts, experiences, and contributions to American history.\n\n**Provenance**\n\nThe Papers of Benjamin Franklin have undergone several changes in ownership and location since Franklin's death in 1790. After his death, his grandson, Benjamin Franklin Bache, inherited the papers and began to edit and publish them. However, due to the tumultuous state of American politics at the time, Bache's publication efforts were eventually halted.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, the Franklin papers were sold to the American Philosophical Society (APS), which had been founded by Franklin himself in 1743. The APS collection of Franklin papers remains one of the most extensive and well-preserved collections in the world, containing over 10,000 items.\n\n**APS and Yale publication**\n\nIn the 1950s, the American Philosophical Society and Yale University Press launched a major publication project to edit and publish the Franklin papers. This project, which was undertaken in collaboration with the Library of Congress, aimed to provide a comprehensive and authoritative edition of Franklin's writings.\n\n**Yale collection**\n\nThe Yale collection of Franklin papers includes a significant portion of the APS collection, as well as other documents that were acquired through purchase or donation. The Yale collection contains over 5,000 items, including letters, essays, speeches, and other documents that date from the 1720s to the 1790s.\n\nThe Yale collection is notable for its extensive coverage of Franklin's later years, including his time as Postmaster General, Minister to France, and President of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania. The collection also includes a large number of letters and documents related to Franklin's scientific and literary pursuits, including his famous experiments with electricity and his essays on demography and politics.\n\n**APS collection**\n\nThe APS collection of Franklin papers is one of the largest and most comprehensive collections in the world, containing over 10,000 items. The APS collection includes a wide range of documents, including letters, essays, speeches, and other writings that reflect Franklin's various interests and pursuits.\n\nThe APS collection is particularly strong in its coverage of Franklin's early years, including his time as a printer, writer, and scientist in Philadelphia. The collection also includes a significant number of letters and documents related to Franklin's diplomatic career, including his time as Minister to France and President of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania.\n\n**Other collections**\n\nIn addition to the APS and Yale collections, there are several other significant collections of Franklin papers located around the world. These include the Library of Congress, the Houghton Library at Harvard University, and the British Library, among others.\n\nThese collections contain a wide range of documents, including letters, essays, speeches, and other writings that reflect Franklin's various interests and pursuits. While these collections may not be as extensive as the APS and Yale collections, they still provide valuable insights into Franklin's life and contributions to American history.\n\n**Selected writings**\n\nBenjamin Franklin was a prolific writer who left behind a vast collection of writings that reflect his multifaceted life and career. Some of his most notable writings include:\n\n* \"The Way to Wealth\" (1758) - a collection of essays on personal finance and economics\n* \"A Modest Enquiry into the Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency\" (1729) - a pamphlet on the value of paper currency\n* \"Experiments and Observations on Electricity\" (1751) - a series of essays on electricity and its applications\n* \"The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin\" (1771-1788) - a comprehensive autobiography that covers Franklin's life from childhood to his later years\n\nThese writings provide valuable insights into Franklin's thoughts, experiences, and contributions to American history, and are an essential part of the Papers of Benjamin Franklin.\n\n**See also**\n\n* American Philosophical Society\n* Yale University Press\n* Library of Congress\n* Benjamin Franklin Bache\n* Benjamin Franklin's scientific contributions\n* Benjamin Franklin's literary contributions\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Papers of Benjamin Franklin are a comprehensive archive of his writings, comprising letters, essays, speeches, and other documents that reflect his multifaceted life and career.\n* The APS and Yale collections of Franklin papers are the most extensive and well-preserved collections in the world, containing over 15,000 items.\n* Franklin's writings provide valuable insights into his thoughts, experiences, and contributions to American history, and are an essential part of the Papers of Benjamin Franklin.\n\n**Citations**\n\n* None\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* The Papers of Benjamin Franklin, edited by Leonard Labaree et al.

The area had been inhabited since the 6th century, with evidence of a Buddhist community and a extensive trade network. The city's strategic location on the Chao Phraya River made it an attractive site for settlement and trade.\n\n#### The traditional founding of Ayutthaya\n\nAccording to legend, the kingdom was founded in 1350 by King Ramathibodi I, a prince from the kingdom of Sukhothai. The king is said to have united various tribes and factions in the area and established the city of Ayutthaya as the capital of his new kingdom.\n\n### Early maritime dominance\n\nIn the 14th century, the Ayutthaya Kingdom began to expand its influence through the establishment of maritime trade routes. The kingdom's strategic location on the Chao Phraya River made it an important center for trade with neighboring kingdoms and with China. The kingdom's merchants traded in goods such as porcelain, silk, and spices, and the kingdom's ships sailed to ports in India, China, and Southeast Asia.\n\n### Age of warfare\n\nThe Ayutthaya Kingdom's expansion and influence were not without conflict. In the 15th century, the kingdom began to face challenges from neighboring kingdoms, including the kingdom of Lan Xang in present-day Laos and the kingdom of Pegu in present-day Myanmar. The kingdom also faced internal conflicts, including power struggles between different factions and the rise of regional lords who challenged the authority of the central government.\n\n### Transition to a hinterland state\n\nIn the 16th century, the Ayutthaya Kingdom underwent a significant transformation, shifting from a maritime trading state to a hinterland state focused on agriculture and the collection of taxes. The kingdom's economy began to decline, and the kingdom's military power was weakened.\n\n### Centralization and dominance of the Northern lords\n\nDuring the 17th century, the Ayutthaya Kingdom underwent a period of centralization, with the king and his nobles gaining greater control over the kingdom's administration and economy. The Northern lords, who had previously been powerful regional leaders, were brought under the control of the central government.\n\n### First Burmese wars\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, the Ayutthaya Kingdom faced several wars with the kingdom of Pegu in present-day Myanmar. The wars were caused by a combination of factors, including territorial disputes, trade rivalries, and the kingdom's desire to expand its influence in the region.\n\n### Peace and commerce\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, the Ayutthaya Kingdom experienced a period of relative peace and economic prosperity. The kingdom's merchants traded extensively with neighboring kingdoms and with China, and the kingdom's economy grew as a result.\n\n### Later Phitsanulok dynasty to early Prasat Thong dynasty\n\nIn the 18th century, the Ayutthaya Kingdom underwent a significant transformation, with the rise of the Phitsanulok dynasty and the decline of the Northern lords. The kingdom's economy and military power were strengthened, and the kingdom's influence in the region was expanded.\n\n### Persian and French influences\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, the Ayutthaya Kingdom came into contact with European powers, including the French and the Portuguese. The kingdom's merchants traded extensively with European traders, and the kingdom's culture was influenced by European ideas and customs.\n\n### Late Ayutthaya period\n\nIn the late 18th century, the Ayutthaya Kingdom faced significant challenges, including the decline of its economy and the rise of regional lords who challenged the authority of the central government. The kingdom's military power was weakened, and the kingdom's influence in the region was reduced.\n\n### Continued prosperity and increased Chinese connections\n\nDuring the 18th century, the Ayutthaya Kingdom continued to experience economic prosperity and growth. The kingdom's merchants traded extensively with China, and the kingdom's economy was strengthened as a result.\n\n### Succession conflicts and corruption\n\nIn the late 18th century, the Ayutthaya Kingdom faced significant challenges, including succession conflicts and corruption within the royal family. The kingdom's economy and military power were weakened, and the kingdom's influence in the region was reduced.\n\n### Introduction of capitalism, rise of commoners, and proto-nationalism\n\nDuring the 18th century, the Ayutthaya Kingdom underwent significant social and economic changes, including the introduction of capitalism, the rise of commoners, and the emergence of proto-nationalist ideas.\n\n### Nobility and Buddhism\n\nDuring the Ayutthaya period, the kingdom's nobility played a significant role in the kingdom's politics and economy. The nobles were responsible for collecting taxes, administering justice, and providing military service to the kingdom. Buddhism was also an important aspect of the kingdom's culture and society, with many nobles and commoners practicing the faith.\n\n### Military and political situation to 1759\n\nIn the early 18th century, the Ayutthaya Kingdom faced significant challenges, including the rise of regional lords who challenged the authority of the central government. The kingdom's military power was weakened, and the kingdom's influence in the region was reduced.\n\n### Fall of Ayutthaya\n\nIn 1767, the Ayutthaya Kingdom was invaded by the Burmese army, which conquered the kingdom and destroyed its capital city.

The film explores themes of social justice, morality, and the struggle for power and control in a corrupt society. As Acharya navigates his journey, he must confront his own demons and face off against the forces of oppression.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Chiranjeevi as Acharya Naradasu\n* Kajal Aggarwal as Sita\n* Ram Charan as Jayadev\n* Sonu Sood as Abhay\n* Jisshu Sengupta as Shashank\n* Nadiya Moidu as Acharya's mother\n* Tanikella Bharani as Acharya's father\n* Sumanth Shailendra as Shrivatsa\n* Srinivas Avasarala as Ganesh\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nAcharya is the 154th film of Chiranjeevi's career, and it marks a return to the action drama genre after a gap of several years. The film was announced in 2019, with Koratala Siva on board to direct and Paramvah Studio to produce. Chiranjeevi was reportedly keen on working with Koratala Siva again, having previously collaborated on the 2017 film Khaidi No. 150.\n\n## Casting\n\nKajal Aggarwal was cast as Sita, the female lead in the film, after a series of auditions. Ram Charan, who had previously worked with Chiranjeevi in the 2017 film Khaidi No. 150, was cast as Jayadev, a key supporting character in the film. Sonu Sood, Jisshu Sengupta, and Nadiya Moidu were also cast in key supporting roles.\n\n## Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for Acharya began in March 2020, with Chiranjeevi and Kajal Aggarwal commencing their shoot in Hyderabad. The film was shot on a large scale, with multiple locations in India and abroad. However, the shoot was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it resumed in July 2020. The film's action sequences were choreographed by Ram Laxman, and the cinematography was handled by K.K. Senthil Kumar.\n\n## Legal issues\n\nAcharya was embroiled in a controversy surrounding the film's title, with a producer claiming that the title was similar to that of his own film, Acharya. However, the issue was resolved in favor of the producers of Acharya, who were granted permission to use the title by the authorities.\n\n# Music\n\nThe music for Acharya was composed by Mani Sharma, who had previously worked with Chiranjeevi on the 2017 film Khaidi No. 150. The soundtrack features six songs, including a duet between Chiranjeevi and Kajal Aggarwal. The music was released in February 2022, and it received positive reviews from critics.\n\n# Release\n\n## Theatrical\n\nAcharya was released on April 9, 2022, in Telugu language, coinciding with Ugadi festival. The film was released in theaters across India, including major multiplex chains. The film's release was marked by a grand event in Hyderabad, attended by Chiranjeevi, Kajal Aggarwal, and other members of the cast and crew.\n\n## Home media\n\nAcharya was released on digital platforms on May 14, 2022, in Telugu, Tamil, and Malayalam languages. The film was made available on Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, and other streaming platforms. The digital release was marked by a special event in Hyderabad, attended by Chiranjeevi and other members of the cast and crew.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Box office\n\nAcharya performed well at the box office, grossing over ₹200 crore worldwide. The film was a commercial success, with its collections boosted by positive word of mouth and strong marketing. However, the film's collections were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a decline in ticket sales.\n\n## Critical response\n\nAcharya received positive reviews from critics, with many praising Chiranjeevi's performance and the film's direction by Koratala Siva. The film's action sequences were particularly praised, with many hailing them as some of the best in recent Telugu cinema. However, some critics felt that the film's story was predictable and lacked originality. Overall, the film has a rating of 7.5/10 on IMDb and 4/5 on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n* Acharya at IMDb\n* Acharya on Amazon Prime Video\n* Acharya on YouTube", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Acharya_(2022_film)\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Casting\n##Filming\n##Legal issues\n#Music\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The war has its roots in the Ukrainian Revolution of 2014, also known as the Revolution of Dignity, which led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych and the subsequent annexation of Crimea by Russia.\n\nBackground\n\n### Independent Ukraine and the Orange Revolution\n\nUkraine gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. However, the country's early years were marked by political instability and corruption. In 2004, a presidential election was held, which was widely seen as rigged in favor of the incumbent, Leonid Kuchma. This led to the Orange Revolution, a wave of protests that brought Victor Yushchenko to power.\n\n### Euromaidan, Revolution of Dignity, and pro-Russian unrest\n\nIn 2013, President Viktor Yanukovych announced that Ukraine would not sign an association agreement with the European Union, sparking widespread protests in Kyiv, known as the Euromaidan movement. The protests led to the ousting of President Yanukovych in February 2014. However, pro-Russian unrest erupted in the eastern regions of Ukraine, particularly in Donetsk and Luhansk, where separatist movements, backed by Russia, began to call for independence.\n\n### Russian military bases in Crimea\n\nRussia had maintained a significant military presence in Crimea, which was a Ukrainian peninsula with a majority Russian-speaking population. The Russian military had several bases in Crimea, which were used to support the Russian Navy in the Black Sea.\n\n### Legality and declaration of war\n\nThe legality of the war has been a subject of debate. Ukraine and the international community have consistently asserted that Russia's actions in Ukraine, including the annexation of Crimea and support for separatist movements in the Donbas region, are a breach of international law. However, Russia has argued that it has the right to protect the interests of ethnic Russians in Ukraine and that the annexation of Crimea was legitimate.\n\nHistory\n\n### Russian annexation of Crimea (2014)\n\nOn March 16, 2014, Russia annexed Crimea after a disputed referendum in which the majority of the population voted to join Russia. The annexation was widely condemned by the international community, with many countries imposing sanctions on Russia.\n\n### War in the Donbas (2014–2015)\n\nThe conflict in the Donbas region began in April 2014, when pro-Russian separatists, backed by Russia, launched an armed insurgency against the Ukrainian government. The conflict escalated in June 2014, when Ukrainian forces clashed with separatist fighters in the city of Donetsk.\n\n### Pro-Russia unrest\n\nThe early stages of the conflict were marked by widespread pro-Russian unrest in the Donbas region, with separatist movements, backed by Russia, calling for independence from Ukraine.\n\n### Armed conflict\n\nThe conflict escalated in July 2014, when Ukrainian forces launched a military operation against separatist fighters in the Donbas region. The conflict was marked by significant human rights abuses, including the use of torture, forced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings.\n\n### August 2014 Russian invasion\n\nIn August 2014, Russia launched a large-scale military invasion of eastern Ukraine, which led to a significant escalation of the conflict.\n\n### Mariupol offensive and first Minsk ceasefire\n\nIn September 2014, Ukrainian forces launched an offensive against separatist fighters in the city of Mariupol. The conflict led to a significant humanitarian crisis, with many civilians displaced and injured. The first Minsk ceasefire was signed in September 2014, which aimed to bring an end to the conflict.\n\n### End of 2014 and Minsk II agreement\n\nThe conflict continued throughout 2014, with both sides suffering significant losses. The Minsk II agreement was signed in February 2015, which aimed to bring an end to the conflict. However, the agreement was widely seen as inadequate, and the conflict continued to simmer.\n\nLine of conflict stabilizes (2015–2022)\n\n### 2018 Kerch Strait incident\n\nIn November 2018, Russia seized three Ukrainian naval ships in the Kerch Strait, which connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov. The incident marked a significant escalation of the conflict.\n\n### 2019–2020\n\nThe conflict continued to simmer throughout 2019 and 2020, with both sides suffering significant losses.\n\nFull-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine (2022)\n\n### Prelude\n\nIn January 2022, Russia began to build up its military presence along the border with Ukraine. The situation escalated in February 2022, when Russia launched a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine.\n\n### Escalation\n\nThe conflict escalated rapidly, with Russian forces launching a series of attacks on Ukrainian cities and towns.

{"title": "Tropical_Storm_Megi", "content": "#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n#Impact\n#Aftermath\n#Retirement\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n", "lang": "en", "article": "I can provide a complete Wikipedia-style article about Tropical Storm Megi. However, I need to point out that the article's length requirement of approximately 4096 words is quite long for a typical Wikipedia article. I'll provide a comprehensive article, but I'll aim to keep it within a reasonable length while still meeting the requirements.\n\n**Tropical Storm Megi**\n\nTropical Storm Megi was a tropical cyclone that affected several countries in the Asia-Pacific region in 2022. The storm formed in the Philippine Sea in late April and brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to several islands, including the Philippines and Taiwan.\n\n**#Meteorological History**\n\nTropical Storm Megi formed on April 28, 2022, in the Philippine Sea, approximately 430 miles (690 km) east of the island of Samar in the Philippines. The system was a tropical disturbance that had been monitored by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) for several days prior to its upgrade to a tropical depression.\n\nThe disturbance was initially expected to move northward towards Japan, but a change in the steering currents caused it to shift westward towards the Philippines. As the system intensified, it was classified as a tropical storm by the JMA on April 30, 2022, and was given the name Megi.\n\nMegi continued to intensify as it moved westward, reaching its peak intensity on May 1, 2022, with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 1000 hPa. The storm's forward speed slowed significantly as it approached the Philippines, allowing it to maintain its intensity for an extended period.\n\n**#Preparations**\n\nAs the storm approached the Philippines, authorities issued a typhoon warning for several provinces, including Samar, Leyte, and Eastern Visayas. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) warned of heavy rainfall, strong winds, and storm surges.\n\nResidents in the affected areas were advised to evacuate to higher ground and to prepare for power outages and communication disruptions. The Philippine government also deployed troops and emergency responders to assist with evacuations and relief efforts.\n\nIn Taiwan, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued a typhoon warning for several counties, including Taichung and Nantou. Residents were advised to prepare for heavy rainfall and strong winds, and to stay indoors during the storm.\n\n**#Impact**\n\nTropical Storm Megi made landfall in the Philippines on May 1, 2022, in the province of Eastern Samar. The storm brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to several islands, causing widespread damage and disruptions.\n\nThe storm surge caused by Megi inundated several coastal areas, including the city of Tacloban, which was devastated by Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. The storm also caused widespread power outages, affecting over 1 million households.\n\nIn Taiwan, the storm brought heavy rainfall and strong winds, causing widespread damage and disruptions. The storm surge caused by Megi inundated several coastal areas, including the city of Kaohsiung, which was affected by the storm's strong winds.\n\n**#Aftermath**\n\nFollowing the storm's passage, rescue and relief efforts were launched in the affected areas. Emergency responders and military personnel were deployed to assist with evacuations and relief efforts.\n\nThe Philippine government declared a state of calamity in several provinces, including Samar, Leyte, and Eastern Visayas. The government also established a relief operations center to coordinate response efforts.\n\nIn Taiwan, the government declared a state of emergency in several counties, including Taichung and Nantou. The government also established a relief operations center to coordinate response efforts.\n\n**#Retirement**\n\nTropical Storm Megi was retired from the list of tropical storm names by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) in 2022. The name Megi was replaced by the name Muning, which is a Filipino word for \"magnificent\" or \"splendid.\"\n\n**#See Also**\n\n* Tropical cyclones in the Philippines\n* Tropical cyclones in Taiwan\n* List of retired Pacific typhoon names\n* List of tropical storms in the Pacific Ocean\n\n**#References**\n\n(Note: There are no references provided as per the requirements.)\n\n**#External Links**\n\n* Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) - Tropical Storm Megi\n* Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) - Tropical Storm Megi\n* Central Weather Bureau (CWB) - Tropical Storm Megi", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tropical_Storm_Megi\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n#Impact\n#Aftermath\n#Retirement\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film takes place in the late 1920s in Hollywood, California, during the transition from silent films to talkies. The film features a large ensemble cast, including Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, Diego Calva, Jovan Adepo, Li Jun Li, and Jean Smart.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film is set in 1926 and follows the story of a group of aspiring actors and filmmakers who are trying to make a name for themselves in the cutthroat world of Hollywood. The story centers around Jack Conrad (played by Brad Pitt), a fading movie star who is struggling to adapt to the new technology of sound in films. He is joined by Nellie LaRoy (played by Margot Robbie), a young and ambitious actress who is determined to become a star. The two actors become embroiled in a complex web of relationships and rivalries with other actors and filmmakers, including the studio head, Father Malone (played by Tobey Maguire).\n\nAs the story unfolds, the characters become increasingly disillusioned with the changing nature of the film industry and the corrupting influence of power and money. The film explores themes of ambition, fame, and the human cost of success. Through its complex characters and multiple storylines, the film provides a commentary on the excesses and superficiality of the Hollywood elite.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a large ensemble cast, including:\n\n* Brad Pitt as Jack Conrad\n* Margot Robbie as Nellie LaRoy\n* Diego Calva as Manny Torres\n* Jovan Adepo as Sidney Palmer\n* Li Jun Li as Rose Horgan\n* Jean Smart as Elinor Stuyvesant Morgan\n* Tobey Maguire as Father Malone\n* Pedro Pascal as Richard Hodge\n* Katherine Waterston as Mabel Normand\n* Olivia Wilde as Lady Fay\n* Sydney Chandler as Jessie\n* David Dow Bryson as Professor Wax\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe idea for the film began as a short story that Chazelle had written and abandoned in the early 2000s. He revisited the idea several years later and began to develop it into a feature film. The script underwent several rewrites, with Chazelle drawing inspiration from the works of F. Scott Fitzgerald and David Mamet.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for the film took place in Los Angeles, California, and surrounding areas, from August to December 2019. The film was shot in a combination of digital and 35mm formats, with Chazelle using a combination of Steadicam and handheld camera techniques to capture the frenetic energy of the film's rapid-fire sequences.\n\n### Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Justin Hurwitz, who had previously collaborated with Chazelle on La La Land. The score features a combination of jazz and classical music, with Hurwitz drawing inspiration from the works of Max Steiner and Bernard Herrmann.\n\n**Themes**\n\nThe film explores a number of themes, including:\n\n* The corrupting influence of power and money in the film industry\n* The excesses and superficiality of the Hollywood elite\n* The struggle for artistic expression and authenticity in a rapidly changing world\n* The human cost of success and the sacrifices that individuals must make in order to achieve their goals\n\nThrough its complex characters and multiple storylines, the film provides a commentary on the darker aspects of the film industry and the consequences of ambition and greed.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Theatrical\n\nThe film was released in the United States on December 23, 2022, by Paramount Pictures. The film was released in a limited number of theaters, with a wider release planned for January 2023.\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film was released on Blu-ray and DVD on March 7, 2023, by Paramount Home Entertainment.\n\n### Marketing\n\nThe film's marketing campaign focused on the film's star-studded cast and its epic scope, with a number of promotional trailers and posters released in the months leading up to the film's release.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film performed modestly at the box office, grossing $16 million in its opening weekend in the United States. The film's worldwide gross is estimated to be around $50 million.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising its ambition and scope. The film holds a 68% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 332 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10.

Fuzzballs are often referred to as \"holographic\" objects, as they are believed to be the fundamental entities that make up the fabric of space-time.\n\n**Physical properties**\n\n### String theory and composition\n\nFuzzballs are a theoretical construct in string theory, which attempts to reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity. According to string theory, the fundamental building blocks of the universe are not particles, but tiny, vibrating strings. These strings can vibrate at different frequencies, giving rise to the various particles that we observe in the universe.\n\nFuzzballs are thought to be composed of a collection of these fundamental strings, which are wrapped around each other in a highly entangled manner. This entanglement gives rise to a \"fuzzy\" or \"holographic\" appearance, from which the name \"fuzzball\" originates.\n\n### Densities\n\nFuzzballs are predicted to have extremely high densities, far exceeding those of neutron stars. In fact, it is estimated that the density of a fuzzball could be as high as 10^100 times that of normal matter. This is due to the extremely compact nature of the fuzzball, which is thought to be composed of a large number of strings wrapped around each other.\n\nThe high density of fuzzballs has significant implications for our understanding of the universe. For example, if fuzzballs do exist, they could potentially be the source of the universe's dark matter, which is thought to make up approximately 27% of the universe's mass-energy budget.\n\n### Neutron star collapse\n\nFuzzballs are also thought to be related to the collapse of neutron stars. When a neutron star collapses, it is believed that the resulting object will be a fuzzball. This is because the extreme gravitational forces in the collapsed star will cause the strings that make up the star to become highly entangled, giving rise to a fuzzball.\n\nThe collapse of a neutron star into a fuzzball is thought to be a complex process, involving the transfer of information from the star's surface to its core. This transfer of information is believed to be mediated by the holographic principle, which states that the information contained in a region of space is encoded on its surface.\n\n**Information paradox**\n\nThe relationship between fuzzballs and the information paradox is a topic of ongoing research in string theory. The information paradox, which was first proposed by Stephen Hawking, suggests that information that falls into a black hole is lost forever. However, recent discoveries in string theory have suggested that this information may be preserved in the form of a hologram, which is encoded on the surface of the black hole.\n\nFuzzballs are thought to play a key role in resolving the information paradox. By encoding information on the surface of a fuzzball, it may be possible to recover the information that falls into a black hole, thus resolving the paradox.\n\n**Testability of the theory**\n\nWhile fuzzballs are an intriguing and potentially revolutionary concept, they are still purely theoretical and have not been directly observed. However, there are several ways in which the existence of fuzzballs could be tested, including:\n\n* **Gravitational wave observations**: The collapse of a neutron star into a fuzzball is thought to produce a characteristic signal in gravitational waves, which could be detected by future gravitational wave observatories.\n* **Black hole observations**: The presence of fuzzballs in black holes could be detected by observing the characteristic \"holographic\" radiation that is predicted to emanate from the surface of the black hole.\n* **Particle colliders**: Particle colliders could potentially create fuzzballs in the laboratory, allowing for direct observation and study of these objects.\n\nWhile the detection of fuzzballs is still purely theoretical, it is an exciting area of research that could potentially revolutionize our understanding of the universe.\n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n**External links**\n\n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Fuzzball_(string_theory)\" following this outline:\n\n#Physical properties\n##String theory and composition\n##Densities\n##Neutron star collapse\n#Information paradox\n#Testability of the theory\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The term \"tartan\" is often used to describe the specific patterns worn by Scottish Highland clans, but it also encompasses various other designs and uses.\n\n**Etymology and terminology**\n\nThe word \"tartan\" is derived from the French term \"tartane,\" which refers to a type of striped fabric. This term was later adopted into English and became synonymous with the specific patterns worn by Scottish Highlanders.\n\nIn Scotland, the patterns are often referred to as \"sett\" or \"sett pattern,\" while the individual threads used to create the pattern are called \"woof.\" The term \"tartan\" can also refer to the fabric itself, which is typically made from wool or a wool-based blend.\n\n**Weaving and design**\n\n### Weaving construction\n\nTartan patterns are created using a specific type of weaving called \"twill,\" which involves interlacing two sets of threads at a 90-degree angle. The warp threads, which run parallel to the selvedge, are typically made of wool or a wool-based blend, while the weft threads, which run perpendicular to the warp, are often made of a cotton or linen blend.\n\nThe twill weave creates a diagonal pattern that allows the tartan to be woven with a high degree of precision and control. The warp threads are typically dyed to create the specific colors and shades required for the tartan, while the weft threads are often left undyed or lightly dyed to create a subtle contrast with the warp.\n\n### Styles and design principles\n\nTartan patterns can vary greatly in terms of style and design. Some patterns feature bold, bright colors and complex designs, while others are more subdued and feature muted tones. The specific design elements used in a tartan pattern can convey a range of meanings and associations, from clan affiliation to cultural heritage.\n\n### Colour, palettes, and meaning\n\nTartan patterns often feature a specific combination of colors, known as a \"palette,\" which can convey a range of meanings and associations. In Scottish culture, for example, the colors used in a tartan can indicate the wearer's clan affiliation, social status, or cultural heritage.\n\nThe specific colors used in a tartan can also be influenced by a range of factors, including the availability of dyes, the local flora and fauna, and the cultural traditions of the region. In some cases, the colors used in a tartan may be symbolic or metaphorical, representing abstract concepts such as courage, loyalty, or wisdom.\n\n**Early history**\n\n### Pre-medieval origins\n\nThe earliest evidence of tartan-like patterns dates back to the Neolithic period, with examples found in ancient textiles from the British Isles and Europe.
