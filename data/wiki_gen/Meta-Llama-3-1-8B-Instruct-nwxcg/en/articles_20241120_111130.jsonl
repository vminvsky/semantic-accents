out of the last four Super Bowls They had previously won Super Bowls XXVII and XXVIII but their chance of a \"three-peat\" (winning three consecutive championships) was thwarted when they lost the NFC Championship Game to the San Francisco 49ers, the eventual Super Bowl XXIX champions This was the Cowboys’ eighth appearance in the Super Bowl, the most of any franchise; the Steelers tied this record in 2010 when that team advanced to Super Bowl XLV The Patriots became the third team to reach the mark in 2014 when that team went on to win Super Bowl XLIX, and the Denver Broncos the fourth team in 2015 in Super Bowl 50.\n\n\nPittsburgh Steelers\nSuper Bowl XXX was the first time that the Steelers advanced to the league championship game since winning Super Bowl XIV and the first under head coach Bill Cowher [19] Cowher took over the team in 1992 after longtime head coach Chuck Noll retired after a 23-year tenure and leading the team to four Super Bowl wins During Cowher's first year, the Steelers captured the number one AFC playoff seed with an 11–5 regular season record, but were eliminated in their first playoff game against the Buffalo Bills, 24–3 [5] Cowher then led the Steelers into the playoffs in 1993 and 1994, but were also eliminated, including a 17–13 upset loss to the San Diego Chargers in the 1994 AFC Championship Game [5]\n\n\nPlayoffs\nThe Cowboys first defeated the Philadelphia Eagles, 30–11 The score was tied 3–3 into the 2nd quarter, until Dallas scored 27 consecutive points to put the game out of reach [5] First, Deion Sanders scored a 21-yard touchdown on an end-around play Emmitt Smith then capped off a 79-yard drive with a 1-yard touchdown run before halftime Kicker Chris Boniol later scored two field goals in the 3rd quarter, and Troy Aikman completed a 9-yard touchdown pass to Michael Irvin in the 4th quarter, giving the Cowboys a commanding 30–3 lead Meanwhile, Eagles quarterback Randall Cunningham was limited to just 11 of 26 completions for 161 yards and no touchdowns, with one interception Philadelphia could only score a single field goal and Cunningham's meaningless 4-yard touchdown run late in the 4th quarter [20]\n\n\nBroadcasting\nThe game was broadcast in the United States by NBC, including local NBC stations KXAS-TV in Dallas and WPXI-TV in Pittsburgh The broadcast featured play-by-play announcer Dick Enberg and color commentators Phil Simms, Paul Maguire, and Jim Gray and Will McDonough on the sidelines Greg Gumbel hosted all the events with the help of then-NBC analysts Ahmad Rashad, Mike Ditka, Joe Gibbs, and Joe Montana [5] The Vince Lombardi Trophy presentation started a tradition that continues today, in which it is held on the field instead of inside the winners' locker room as was the case previously  NBC would go on to purchase KXAS which aired all three of the Cowboys' 1990s Super Bowl victories [citation needed]\n\n\nEntertainment\nThe pregame show held before the game featured

XXX\n\nIntroduction\nSuper Bowl XXX was the 30th championship game of the National Football League (NFL) and the culmination of the 1995 NFL season. The game was played on January 28, 1996, at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona, and was broadcast by NBC. The Dallas Cowboys, led by head coach Barry Switzer, faced off against the Pittsburgh Steelers, led by head coach Bill Cowher.\n\nBackground\nThe NFL had originally chosen Sun Devil Stadium as the venue for Super Bowl XXVII on March 13, 1990. However, the league pulled the game from Arizona in the midst of a large entertainment and convention boycott to protest the state's refusal to adopt the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday. As a compromise, the NFL owners reserved Super Bowl XXX for Tempe on a \"preliminary\" and \"conditional\" basis. Arizona voters approved the MLK Day holiday in November 1992, and the NFL responded by formally assigning Super Bowl XXX to Tempe at their March 1993 meeting in Palm Desert, California. No other cities put in a bid or were considered for the hosting duties.\n\nHost Selection Process\nThe selection of Sun Devil Stadium as the host venue for Super Bowl XXX was a result of the compromise reached between the NFL and the state of Arizona in 1990. The stadium had been chosen as the venue for Super Bowl XXVII, but the game was ultimately pulled due to the boycott. The NFL owners agreed to reserve Super Bowl XXX for Tempe, pending the approval of the MLK Day holiday by the state of Arizona.\n\nDallas Cowboys\nThe Dallas Cowboys entered the 1995 regular season attempting to become the first team in NFL history to win three out of the last four Super Bowls.

Born on 26 September 1982 in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, Burrow is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nBurrow was born to Irene (née Bateman) and Geoffrey, a branch secretary for the GMB trade union. He had two older sisters and grew up in Castleford, where he began playing rugby league at the age of seven for Castleford Panthers. Burrow later played at junior level with Featherstone Lions.\n\n**Club Career**\n\nBurrow joined Leeds Rhinos in 1999 and spent the next couple of years in the academy ranks. He made his first-team debut for Leeds in April 2001, appearing as a substitute in a defeat against Hull. Burrow made his first start for the club a week later, scoring a try in a 6-36 defeat against Warrington Wolves. He received further first-team opportunities later in the season after Leeds first-choice scrum-half, Ryan Sheridan, was injured. Burrow had a number of impressive performances, most notably scoring two tries in a 23-18 win against reigning champions St Helens. He was named the Super League Young Player of the Year at the end of the season.\n\n**One-match Return**\n\nOn 12 January 2020, one month after his Motor Neurone Disease diagnosis, Burrow came out of retirement to play for Leeds in a pre-season game against Bradford Bulls. The match was originally planned as a testimonial match for Jamie Jones-Buchanan, who retired after the 2019 season, but was rebranded to \"Jamie Jones-Buchanan testimonial and Rob Burrow support match,\" with a portion of the revenue going to MND support charities. The match was played by the Leeds first team, but saw a number of Jones-Buchanan's and Burrow's former teammates also come out of retirement for the match. Burrow came on as an interchange with five minutes left to play, and Leeds won the match 34-10.\n\n**International Career**\n\nBurrow made his debut for Great Britain in the team's opening match of the 2005 Tri-Nations against New Zealand.\n\n**Playing Style**\n\nAt 5'5\" tall, Burrow was the smallest player in the Super League for many years during his career. According to a teammate, his agility and quickness were phenomenal, which, along with his low center of gravity, made him very difficult to defend. He was often compared to other diminutive half-backs such as Roger Millward and Allan Langer.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nBurrow married his wife Lindsey in 2006. They met when they were both 15 and together have three children: two daughters, Macy and Maya, and a son, Jackson. Burrow's autobiography, \"Too Many Reasons to Live,\" was published in 2021 and won the Autobiography of the Year at the 2022 Sports Book Awards. He was a fan of the American NFL football team the Seattle Seahawks. In June 2024, Burrow's wife Lindsey revealed that he had recorded a series of messages to be played for his children at special moments in their lives as they grow up.\n\n**Illness and Death**\n\nOn 19 December 2019, Burrow revealed that he had been diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND).\n\n**Tributes**\n\nOn 3 June, a minute's silence was held for Rob Burrow at St James' Park ahead of the England national football team's UEFA Euro 2024 warm-up fixture against Bosnia.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nIn September 2021, an appeal was launched to build a care centre for MND patients in the Leeds area, which would be named the Rob Burrow Centre for Motor Neurone Disease. To raise money for the facility, the annual Leeds Half Marathon was paired with a full marathon named the Rob Burrow Leeds Marathon.

{"title": "The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series)", "content": "\nSeries overview\nThe Walking Dead takes place after the onset of a worldwide zombie apocalypse The zombies, referred to as \"walkers\", shamble towards living humans and other creatures to eat them They are attracted to noise and to scents, including the scent of humans Humans who are bitten or scratched by walkers die and become walkers themselves Early in the series, it is suggested that, because any human who dies will reanimate as a walker regardless of cause of death, all living humans carry a pathogen responsible for the mutation that turns humans into walkers No pathogen is ever confirmed, however The mutation is activated after the death of the host The only way to permanently kill a walker is to damage its brain or to destroy the body entirely (e.g via cremation).\n\n\nSeason 1 (2010)\nWhen sheriff's deputy Rick Grimes of King County, Georgia, wakes from a coma, he discovers the world has been overrun by zombies (\"walkers\") Rick befriends Morgan Jones and travels alone to Atlanta before finding his wife Lori, son Carl, and his police partner and best friend Shane Walsh in the woods with other survivors

pregnant Shane and Rick's friendship deteriorates, until Rick is forced to kill Shane in self-defense The commotion attracts walkers to the farm, forcing Rick's group and Hershel's family to evacuate [12]\n\n\nSeason 3 (2012–13)\nEight months after fleeing the farm, Rick's group—sans Andrea—finds a remote prison, which they make their new home after clearing it of walkers Lori dies from an emergency C section, and Rick starts to become unhinged and hallucinate Andrea was rescued by Michonne and the two discover Woodbury, a fortified town led by a deceitful man known as \"the Governor\" who seeks to destroy the group at the prison Conflict erupts between the two groups leading to the fall of Woodbury, but the Governor kills Andrea and escapes The remaining citizens of Woodbury move into the prison [13]\n\n\nSeason 4 (2013–14)\nSeveral months after the Governor's attack, a deadly flu kills many of the people at the prison The Governor finds Martinez, his former right-hand man and

other and make new acquaintances They all find numerous signs pointing to a safe haven called Terminus Group by group, they reunite at Terminus, but Rick's group, sans Carol, is captured for an unknown purpose [14]\n\n\nSeason 5 (2014–15)\nThe residents of Terminus have become cannibals Carol leads a charge that frees Rick's group Some of the group are captured by a group of corrupt cops

quickly realize the residents are ill-prepared to do what it takes to survive Rick becomes attracted to Jessie Anderson and discovers she has an abusive husband Deanna orders Rick to execute the man after he kills her husband as Morgan arrives unexpectedly [15] [16]\n\n\nSeason 6 (2015–16)\nDeanna gives Rick command of Alexandria to protect the town A group known as the Wolves use a zombie horde to attack Alexandria, and Deanna and the entire Anderson family (among others) are killed While recovering, Alexandria learns of a community called the Hilltop Paul \"Jesus\" Rovia invites them to trade supplies with Hilltop if they can help end the threat of the extortionist Saviors led by a man named Negan Although Rick's group decimate one Savior outpost, they are later caught by Negan and forced to submit to him.\n\n\nSeason 7 (2016–17)\nNegan brutally murders Abraham and Glenn, initiating his rule over Alexandria His actions initially lead Rick to submit, but Michonne persuades him to fight back They encounter a community called the Scavengers and ask them for help Carol and Morgan befriend King Ezekiel, the leader of the Kingdom, while Maggie and Sasha rally the Hilltop Rosita and Eugene make a bullet to kill Negan When the bullet is blocked by Lucille, Negan's baseball bat, Negan forcefully recruits Eugene as a Savior The Saviors and turncoat Scavengers attack Alexandria but are repelled by Sasha's sacrifice and the aid of Kingdom and Hilltop soldiers.\n\n\nSeason 8 (2017–18)\nRick, Maggie, and Ezekiel rally their communities into war against Negan and the Saviors Losses

peacefully and restart society anew Negan attempts to wipe out Rick and his allies in a final battle, but Eugene thwarts his plan by sabotaging the Saviors' bullets Rick wounds Negan, but against Maggie's wishes, spares and imprisons Negan, ending the war.\n\n\nSeason 9 (2018–19)\nEighteen months after Negan's downfall, Rick proposes building a bridge to ease trading, but this leads to more resentment Rick is seemingly killed when he destroys the bridge to prevent an invasion of walkers Six years later, his absence has caused estrangement between the communities, and a new walker-controlling threat called the Whisperers demand the survivors do not trespass in their territory Their leader, Alpha, has acquired a large horde of walkers that she will unleash if they do so After her daughter Lydia abandons her mother's group for the Kingdom's, Alpha disowns her and massacres many residents during a fair.\n\n\nSeason 10 (2019–21)\nAlpha begins breaking down the communities with seemingly random walker attacks and acts of sabotage Under Carol's orders, Negan infiltrates the Whisperers and assassinates Alpha Her right-hand man Beta takes command of the Whisperers, but he and the horde are defeated by the survivors Eugene leads a group to West Virginia to meet a new group of survivors Meanwhile, Michonne travels north to search for Rick after finding evidence he survived his apparent death.\n\n\nSeason 11 (2021–22)\nEugene's group convinces the Commonwealth, a large, prosperous community with a strict class system, to lend aid and refuge to the Coalition However, autocratic governor Pamela Milton becomes hostile toward the Coalition after her corruption is exposed and her son Sebastian is killed The Coalition leads a revolution against

Ezekiel takes over as governor After the Coalition is rebuilt, Daryl leaves to find others.\n\n\nCast and characters\nThe list below contains those that have been credited within the series' title sequence and those who are credited as \"also starring\" Recurring and guest stars are listed on the individual season pages.\n\n\nDarabont connections\nThe series features several actors whom series developer Frank Darabont has worked with previously, including Laurie Holden (Andrea), Jeffrey DeMunn (Dale Horvath), Melissa McBride (Carol Peletier), Juan Pareja (Morales) and Sam Witwer (the dead soldier in the tank where Rick Grimes hides in \"Days Gone Bye\") All five appeared in his 2007 film The Mist, [115] along with Thomas Jane, who originally was set to star in the series as Rick Grimes when it was pitched to HBO [116] [117] [118] Jane was in fall 2010 in talks with Darabont to possibly guest star on the series; [119] however, with Darabont's departure, [120] a guest appearance for Jane never materialized Holden also appeared in the 2001 film The Majestic, which Darabont also directed DeMunn has appeared in several of Darabont's films; in addition to The Mist and The Majestic, he appeared in The Shawshank Redemption (1994) and The Green Mile (1999) It was planned that Witwer (Private Jessup in Darabont's The Mist) would reprise his \"Days Gone Bye\" role in the original conception of the series' second-season premiere [121] and in a webisode, [122] but both plans were discarded [123]\n\n\nProduction\nOn January 20, 2010, AMC officially announced that it had ordered a pilot for a possible series adapted from The Walking Dead comic book series, with Frank Darabont and Gale Anne Hurd acting as executive producers and Darabont writing and directing [124] The entire series was pre-ordered based just on the strength of the source material, the television scripts, and Darabont's involvement [125] In January 2010 a review of the pilot episode's script attracted further attention [126] The pilot began filming in Atlanta, Georgia on May 15, 2010 [127] after AMC had officially ordered a six-episode first season [128] The series's remaining episodes began filming on June 2, 2010, with Darabont serving as showrunner [129] [130] On August 31, 2010, Darabont reported that The Walking Dead had been picked up for a second season, with production to begin in February 2011 On November 8, 2010, AMC confirmed that there would be a second season consisting of 13 episodes [131] He would also like to include some of the \"environmental elements\" that take place during Volume 2 of Kirkman's book [132]\n\n\nDevelopment\nOn January 20, 2010, AMC officially announced that it had ordered a pilot for a possible series adapted from The Walking Dead comic book series, with Frank Darabont and Gale Anne Hurd acting as executive producers and Darabont writing and directing [124] The entire series was pre-ordered based just on the strength of the source material, the television scripts, and Darabont's involvement [125] In January 2010 a review of the pilot episode's script attracted further attention [126] The pilot began filming in Atlanta, Georgia

second season consisting of 13 episodes [131] He would also like to include some of the \"environmental elements\" that take place during Volume 2 of Kirkman's book [132]\n\n\nCrew\nThe first season writing staff consisted of series developer and executive producer Frank Darabont (who wrote/co-wrote four of the six episodes), executive producer Charles H Eglee, executive producer and creator of the comic book Robert Kirkman, co-executive producer Jack LoGiudice, consulting producer Adam Fierro and Glen Mazzara, all of whom contributed to one episode each Along with Darabont, who directed the pilot episode, the remaining five were directed by Michelle MacLaren, Gwyneth Horder-Payton, Johan Renck, Ernest Dickerson, and Guy Ferland, respectively [133]\n\n\nWriting\nThe television series generally tends to follow Kirkman's comic series across major characters and plots; for instance, events of the premiere episode of the seventh season correlate to events in issue #100 of the comics [144] [145] The series does not attempt to go step-by-step with the comics, and has leeway in the narrative In particular, the series's writers, along with Kirkman, often \"transfer\" how a character has died in the comics to a different character in the series For example, in the fourth season, where Hershel Greene is beheaded by the Governor in the standoff with Rick's group at the prison; in the comic, Tyreese is the one who suffers this fate [144] Some of the television characters, like Carol, have far outlived their comic counterparts, while others that have already been killed off, like Sophia and Andrea, remained alive for some time in the ongoing comic series [145] In addition, the writers have included characters wholly novel to the series such as Daryl Dixon, which producer Gale Anne Hurd says helps to create a new dynamic for the series, and keeps the audience guessing from what had already been established in the comic series [146]\n\n\nCasting\nThe Walking Dead has featured a large rotating ensemble cast In most cases, because of the nature of the show, departure of actors from the show are determined by the writing, with characters either killed off or written off the show as necessary to develop the story Cast members are generally told ahead of time if they have been written off the show, but otherwise kept to secrecy For example, Steven Yeun, who played Glenn Rhee since the pilot through the season seven premiere, knew of his character's death for a year but had to keep quiet, [147] while Chandler Riggs, playing Carl Grimes through the eighth season, was told of his character's departure during the filming in the weeks leading into his final episodes [148]\n\n\nMusic\nBear McCreary was hired to compose the score for the series McCreary stated that the main theme was based on his viewing of production designs for the opening title sequence Instead of doing a full theme song as with his earlier works, McCreary chose to use a simple, repeating motif from the strings section [161]\n\n\nSoundtracks\nFour soundtracks for The Walking Dead have been released to date The Walking Dead: AMC Original Soundtrack, Vol 1 was released on March 17, 2013 [162] The second volume was released on March 25, 2014 [163] Songs of Survival is a soundtrack for the third season and it was released on August 27, 2013, by Republic Records as a Walmart exclusive for the special edition release of the third season [164] Songs of Survival, Vol 2 is a soundtrack for the fourth season and it was released on August 26, 2014, by Republic Records as a Walmart exclusive of the fourth season release [165]\n\n\nMakeup\nGreg Nicotero is an executive producer and the key special effects makeup artist on the series Each walker is put through \"zombie school\" and is taught how to move like a zombie There are three levels of zombie makeup: Hero, Midground, and Deep Background Hero zombies are featured walkers and are completely made over from head to toe Midground zombies get highlights and shadows on the face, but do not get close enough to the camera to require full makeup Deep background zombies often wear masks and are only meant to be used as a backdrop [166]\n\n\nFilming\nThe Walking Dead is predominantly filmed in Georgia [167] Since 2002, the state has offered a tax incentive for large film productions to drive producers to the state and bolster its economy [168]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe Walking Dead debuted during the same week in 120 countries As part of an expansive campaign to advertise and heighten anticipation for the premiere, AMC and Fox International Channels coordinated a worldwide zombie invasion event on October 26, 2010 The stunt involved invading 26 major cities within a 24-hour period, starting with Taipei and Hong Kong, and ending in Los Angeles for the U.S premiere [177]\n\n\nGreen initiatives\nWith a primary objective of reducing the environmental impacts of film and television productions, including The Walking Dead, producer Gale Anne Hurd has directed the cast, crew, production team, suppliers, and bloggers about her series to adopt the Doddle app to make the production almost paper-free; this works by digitally transmitting interactive call sheets and other intra-team and team-supplier communications (such as directions, images, menus, and updates) to people's cell phones and tablets Hurd said of using Doddle: in addition to conserving paper, \"It's also easier, and it's better for security People are less likely to leave their smartphone or tablet lying around for someone else to pick up.\" [183] [184]\n\n\nRelease\nScenes from the pilot were screened July 23, 2010, as part of San Diego Comic-Con in 2010 [186] It premiered on AMC on October 31, 2010, and premiered internationally on Fox International Channels during the first week of November [187] [188] Almost two weeks before the official premiere on AMC, the pilot episode leaked online [189]\n\n\nHome media\nThe first season DVD and Blu-ray was released on March 8, 2011 [194] A three-disc special edition of the first season—featuring new featurettes and audio commentaries—was released on DVD and Blu-ray on October

television standards [212]\n\n\nReception\nThe first six seasons and the ninth, tenth and eleventh seasons of The Walking Dead have been well reviewed by recognized critics, while the seventh and eighth seasons received more mixed reviews On Rotten Tomatoes, the series has an average score of 80% [231]\n\n\nCritical reception\nThe first six seasons and the ninth, tenth and eleventh seasons of The Walking Dead have been well reviewed by recognized critics, while the seventh and eighth seasons received more mixed reviews On Rotten Tomatoes, the series has an average score of 80% [231]\n\n\nComments about diversity\nSome critics have commented on the increasing diversity of the series [238] [239] [240] This approach was initially applauded by commentators [238] [239] In 2015, Lindsay Putnam of the New York Post questioned whether the show was in danger of becoming \"too diverse\" as the show \"seemingly reached critical mass for its nonwhite, nonmale survivors — and now has no choice but to kill them off\" [238] Robert Kirkman has discussed the increasing diversity of the show and the comic books He has described how he regrets the lack of diversity in the early issues of the comic book series and explained how they would have been \"vastly more diverse\" if he were to have started them now [241]\n\n\nRatings\nDuring its first season, The Walking Dead attracted between four and six million viewers [242] Viewership began to increase in its second season During seasons three to seven, it attracted ten to seventeen million viewers [242] In 2012, during its third season, it became the first cable series in television history to have the highest total viewership of any series during the fall season among 18- to 49-year-old adults [242] [243] In 2014, total viewership for the show's fifth-season premiere was 17.3 million, making it the most-watched series episode in cable history [244] [245] In 2016, a New York Times study of the 50 television series with the most Facebook likes found that like most other zombie series, The Walking Dead \"is most popular in rural areas, particularly southern Texas and eastern Kentucky\" [246] Ratings began to decline during season seven and continued to steadily drop thereafter The ratings decline was attributed to a variety of factors, including Rick's presumed death By the end of season nine, the show had fewer viewers than it had at any time since its first season [247]\n\n\nAwards and nominations\nThe Walking Dead was nominated for Best New Series by the Writers Guild of America

series developed by Frank Darabont, based on the comic book series of the same name by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard. The series premiered on October 31, 2010, on AMC and has since become one of the most popular and critically acclaimed television shows of all time.\n\n**Series Overview**\n\nThe Walking Dead takes place after the onset of a worldwide zombie apocalypse. The zombies, referred to as \"walkers,\" shamble towards living humans and other creatures to eat them. They are attracted to noise and to scents, including the scent of humans. Humans who are bitten or scratched by walkers die and become walkers themselves. Early in the series, it is suggested that, because any human who dies will reanimate as a walker regardless of cause of death, all living humans carry a pathogen responsible for the mutation that turns humans into walkers. No pathogen is ever confirmed, however. The mutation is activated after the death of the host. The only way to permanently kill a walker is to damage its brain or to destroy the body entirely (e.g. via cremation).\n\n**Season 1 (2010)**\n\nWhen sheriff's deputy Rick Grimes of King County, Georgia, wakes from a coma, he discovers the world has been overrun by zombies (\"walkers\"). Rick befriends Morgan Jones and travels alone to Atlanta before finding his wife Lori, son Carl, and his police partner and best friend Shane Walsh in the woods with other survivors. After being attacked by walkers at night, the whole group travels back to Atlanta to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) building, but find from the sole remaining scientist that no cure yet exists for the pandemic.\n\n**Season 2 (2011-12)**\n\nRick's group, searching for Carol's missing daughter, Sophia, takes shelter at a farm run by Hershel Greene. Tensions with Hershel's family worsen after it is discovered that he has a barn full of walkers: former friends and family members. Rick learns that Shane and Lori were romantically involved while he was in a coma, and that Lori is pregnant. Shane and Rick's friendship deteriorates, until Rick is forced to kill Shane in self-defense. The commotion attracts walkers to the farm, forcing Rick's group and Hershel's family to evacuate.\n\n**Season 3 (2012-13)**\n\nEight months after fleeing the farm, Rick's group—sans Andrea—finds a remote prison, which they make their new home after clearing it of walkers. Lori dies from an emergency C-section, and Rick starts to become unhinged and hallucinate. Andrea was rescued by Michonne and the two discover Woodbury, a fortified town led by a deceitful man known as \"the Governor\" who seeks to destroy the group at the prison. Conflict erupts between the two groups leading to the fall of Woodbury, but the Governor kills Andrea and escapes. The remaining citizens of Woodbury move into the prison.\n\n**Season 4 (2013-14)**\n\nSeveral months after the Governor's attack, a deadly flu kills many of the people at the prison. The Governor finds Martinez, his former right-hand man and kills him, taking over his group before leading them into the prison. Rick's group is forced to separate and flee, while Hershel and the Governor are killed. The scattered survivors try to find each other and make new acquaintances. They all find numerous signs pointing to a safe haven called Terminus. Group by group, they reunite at Terminus, but Rick's group, sans Carol, is captured for an unknown purpose.\n\n**Season 5 (2014-15)**\n\nThe residents of Terminus have become cannibals. Carol leads a charge that frees Rick's group. Some of the group are captured by a group of corrupt cops based out of Grady Memorial Hospital. After the group migrates to Virginia, a stranger named Aaron approaches, inviting them to join the fortified community of Alexandria, led by Deanna Monroe. They quickly realize the residents are ill-prepared to do what it takes to survive. Rick becomes attracted to Jessie Anderson and discovers she has an abusive husband. Deanna orders Rick to execute the man after he kills her husband as Morgan arrives unexpectedly.\n\n**Season 6 (2015-16)**\n\nDeanna gives Rick command of Alexandria to protect the town. A group known as the Wolves use a zombie horde to attack Alexandria, and Deanna and the entire Anderson family (among others) are killed. While recovering, Alexandria learns of a community called the Hilltop. Paul \"Jesus\" Rovia invites them to trade supplies with Hilltop if they can help end the threat of the extortionist Saviors led by a man named Negan. Although Rick's group decimate one Savior outpost, they are later caught by Negan and forced to submit to him.\n\n**Season 7 (2016-17)**\n\nNegan brutally murders Abraham and Glenn, initiating his rule over Alexandria. His actions initially lead Rick to submit, but Michonne persuades him to fight back. They encounter a community called the Scavengers and ask them for help. Carol and Morgan befriend King Ezekiel, the leader of the Kingdom, while Maggie and Sasha rally the Hilltop. Rosita and Eugene make a bullet to kill Negan, but it is blocked by Lucille, Negan's baseball bat. Negan forcefully recruits Eugene as a Savior. The Saviors and turncoat Scavengers attack Alexandria but are repelled by Sasha's sacrifice and the aid of Kingdom and Hilltop soldiers.\n\n**Season 8 (2017-18)**\n\nRick, Maggie, and Ezekiel rally their communities into war against Negan and the Saviors. Losses are heavy on both sides, and many of the Kingdom's soldiers are killed. Alexandria falls to a Savior attack, and Carl is bitten by a walker. Before euthanizing himself, Carl convinces Rick to end the war peacefully and restart society anew. Negan attempts to wipe out Rick and his allies in a final battle, but Eugene thwarts his plan by sabotaging the Saviors' bullets. Rick wounds Negan, but against Maggie's wishes, spares and imprisons Negan, ending the war.\n\n**Season 9 (2018-19)**\n\nEighteen months after Negan's downfall, Rick proposes building a bridge to ease trading, but this leads to more resentment. Rick is seemingly killed when he destroys the bridge to prevent an invasion of walkers. Six years later, his absence has caused estrangement between the communities, and a new walker-controlling threat called the Whisperers demands the survivors do not trespass in their territory. Their leader, Alpha, has acquired a large horde of walkers that she will unleash if they do so.\n\n**Season 10 (2019-21)**\n\nAlpha begins breaking down the communities with seemingly random walker attacks and acts of sabotage. Under Carol's orders, Negan infiltrates the Whisperers and assassinates Alpha. Her right-hand man Beta takes command of the Whisperers, but he and the horde are defeated by the survivors. Eugene leads a group to West Virginia to meet a new group of survivors. Michonne travels north to search for Rick after finding evidence he survived his apparent death.\n\n**Season 11 (2021-22)**\n\nEugene's group convinces the Commonwealth, a large, prosperous community with a strict class system, to lend aid and refuge to the Coalition. The Coalition leads a revolution against Pamela, the autocratic governor of the Commonwealth, when she tries to sacrifice the lower classes to a horde containing more intelligent walker variants. In the aftermath, Rosita dies of a bite, Negan is accepted by Maggie as an ally, and Ezekiel takes over as governor. Daryl leaves to find others.\n\n**Cast and Characters**\n\nThe Walking Dead has featured a large rotating ensemble cast. In most cases, because of the nature of the show, departure of actors from the show are determined by the writing, with characters either killed off or written off the show as necessary to develop the story. Cast members are generally told ahead of time if they have been written off the show, but otherwise kept to secrecy.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe Walking Dead debuted during the same week in 120 countries. As part of an expansive campaign to advertise and heighten anticipation for the premiere, AMC and Fox International Channels coordinated a worldwide zombie invasion event on October 26, 2010. The stunt involved invading 26 major cities within a 24-hour period, starting with Taipei and Hong Kong, and ending in Los Angeles for the U.S premiere.\n\n**Green Initiatives**\n\nWith a primary objective of reducing the environmental impacts of film and television productions, including The Walking Dead, producer Gale Anne Hurd has directed the cast, crew, production team, suppliers, and bloggers about her series to adopt the Doddle app to make the production almost paper-free.\n\n**Home Media**\n\nThe first season DVD and Blu-ray was released on March 8, 2011. A three-disc special edition of the first season—featuring new featurettes and audio commentaries—was released on DVD and Blu-ray on October 4, 2011.\n\n**Syndication**\n\nMyNetworkTV acquired the broadcast syndication rights to the series, premiering on October 1, 2014. The version that airs on MyNetworkTV is edited to meet broadcast television standards.\n\n**Awards and Nominations**\n\nThe Walking Dead was nominated for Best New Series by the Writers Guild of America Awards 2011 and Best Television Series Drama by the 68th Golden Globe Awards. The series was named one of the top 10 television programs of 2010 by the American Film Institute Awards 2010.\n\n**Franchise and Spinoffs**\n\nAs of 2018, four web series based on The Walking Dead

sequence and those who are credited as \"also starring\" Recurring and guest stars are listed on the individual season pages.\n\n\nDarabont connections\nThe series features several actors whom series developer Frank Darabont has worked with previously, including Laurie Holden (Andrea), Jeffrey DeMunn (Dale Horvath), Melissa McBride (Carol Peletier), Juan Pareja (Morales) and Sam Witwer (the dead soldier in the tank where Rick Grimes hides in \"Days Gone Bye\") All five appeared in his 2007 film The Mist, [115] along with Thomas Jane, who originally was set to star in the series as Rick Grimes when it was pitched to HBO [116] [117] [118] Jane was in fall 2010 in talks with Darabont to possibly guest star on the series; [119] however, with Darabont's departure, [120] a guest appearance for Jane never materialized Holden also appeared in the 2001 film The Majestic, which Darabont also directed DeMunn has appeared in several of Darabont's films; in addition to The Mist and The Majestic, he appeared in The Shawshank Redemption (1994) and The Green Mile (1999) It was planned that Witwer (Private Jessup in Darabont's The Mist) would reprise his \"Days Gone Bye\" role in the original conception of the series' second-season premiere [121] and in a webisode, [122] but both plans were discarded [123]\n\n\nProduction\nOn January 20, 2010, AMC officially announced that it had ordered a pilot for a possible series adapted from The Walking Dead comic book series, with Frank Darabont and Gale Anne Hurd acting as executive producers and Darabont writing and directing [124] The entire series was pre-ordered based just on the strength of the source material, the television scripts, and Darabont's involvement [125] In January 2010 a review of the pilot episode's script attracted further attention [126] The pilot began filming in Atlanta, Georgia on May 15, 2010 [127] after AMC had officially ordered a six-episode first season [128] The series's remaining episodes began filming on June 2, 2010, with Darabont serving as showrunner [129] [130] On August 31, 2010, Darabont reported that The Walking Dead had been picked up for a second season, with production to begin in February 2011 On November 8, 2010, AMC confirmed that there would be a second season consisting of 13 episodes [131] He would also like to include some of the \"environmental elements\" that take place during Volume 2 of Kirkman's book [132]\n\n\nDevelopment\nOn January 20, 2010, AMC officially announced that it had ordered a pilot for a possible series adapted from The Walking Dead comic book

second season consisting of 13 episodes [131] He would also like to include some of the \"environmental elements\" that take place during Volume 2 of Kirkman's book [132]\n\n\nCrew\nThe first season writing staff consisted of series developer and executive producer Frank Darabont (who wrote/co-wrote four of the six episodes), executive producer Charles H Eglee, executive producer and creator of the comic book Robert Kirkman, co-executive producer Jack LoGiudice, consulting producer Adam Fierro and Glen Mazzara, all of whom contributed to one episode each Along with Darabont, who directed the pilot episode, the remaining five were directed by Michelle MacLaren, Gwyneth Horder-Payton, Johan Renck, Ernest Dickerson, and Guy Ferland, respectively [133]\n\n\nWriting\nThe television series generally tends to follow Kirkman's comic series across major characters and plots; for instance, events of the premiere episode of the seventh season correlate to events in issue #100 of the comics [144] [145] The series does not attempt to go step-by-step with the comics, and has leeway in the narrative In particular, the series's writers, along with Kirkman, often \"transfer\" how a character has died in the comics to a different character in the series For example, in the fourth season, where Hershel Greene is beheaded by the Governor in the standoff with Rick's group at the prison; in the comic, Tyreese is the one who suffers this fate [144] Some of the television characters, like Carol, have far outlived their comic counterparts, while others that have already been killed off, like Sophia and Andrea, remained alive for some time in the ongoing comic series [145] In addition, the writers have included characters wholly novel to the series such as Daryl Dixon, which producer Gale Anne Hurd says helps to create a new dynamic for the series, and keeps the audience guessing from what had already been established in the comic series [146]\n\n\nCasting\nThe Walking Dead has featured a large rotating ensemble cast In most cases, because of the nature of the show, departure of actors from the show are determined by the writing, with characters either killed off or written off the show as necessary to develop the story Cast members are generally told ahead of time if they have been written off the show, but otherwise kept to secrecy For example, Steven Yeun, who played Glenn Rhee since the pilot through the season seven premiere, knew of his character's death for a year but had to keep quiet, [147] while Chandler Riggs, playing Carl Grimes through the eighth season, was told of his character's departure during the filming in the weeks leading into his final episodes [148]\n\n\nMusic\nBear McCreary was hired to compose the score for the series McCreary stated that the main theme was based on his viewing of production designs for the opening title sequence Instead of doing a full theme song as with his earlier works, McCreary chose to use a simple, repeating motif from the strings section [161]\n\n\nSoundtracks\nFour soundtracks for The Walking Dead have been released to date The Walking Dead: AMC Original Soundtrack, Vol 1 was released on March 17, 2013 [162] The second volume was released on March 25, 2014 [163] Songs of Survival is a soundtrack for the third season and it was released on August 27, 2013, by Republic Records as a Walmart exclusive for the special edition release of the third season [164] Songs of Survival, Vol 2 is a soundtrack for the fourth season and it was released on August 26, 2014, by Republic Records as a Walmart exclusive of the fourth season release [165]\n\n\nMakeup\nGreg Nicotero is an executive producer and the key special effects makeup artist on the series Each walker is put through \"zombie school\" and is taught how to move like a zombie There are three levels of zombie makeup: Hero, Midground, and Deep Background Hero zombies are featured walkers and are completely made over from head to toe Midground zombies get highlights and shadows on the face, but do not get close enough to the camera to require full makeup Deep background zombies often wear masks and are only meant to be used as a backdrop [166]\n\n\nFilming\nThe Walking Dead is predominantly filmed in Georgia [167] Since 2002, the state has offered a tax incentive for large film productions to drive producers to the state and bolster its economy [168]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe Walking Dead debuted during the same week in 120 countries As part of an expansive campaign to advertise and heighten anticipation for the premiere, AMC and Fox International Channels coordinated a worldwide zombie invasion event on October 26, 2010 The stunt involved invading 26 major cities within a 24-hour period, starting with Taipei and Hong Kong, and ending in Los Angeles for the U.S premiere [177]\n\n\nGreen initiatives\nWith a primary objective of reducing the environmental impacts of film and television productions, including The Walking Dead, producer Gale Anne Hurd has directed the cast, crew, production team, suppliers, and bloggers about her series to adopt the Doddle app to make the production almost paper-free; this works by digitally transmitting interactive call sheets and other intra-team and team-supplier communications (such as directions, images, menus, and updates) to people's cell phones and tablets Hurd said of using Doddle: in addition to conserving paper, \"It's also easier, and it's better for security People are less likely to leave their smartphone or tablet lying around for someone else to pick up.\" [183] [184]\n\n\nRelease\nScenes from the pilot were screened July 23, 2010, as part of San Diego Comic-Con in 2010 [186] It premiered on AMC on October 31, 2010, and premiered internationally on Fox International Channels during the first week of November [187] [188] Almost two weeks before the official premiere on AMC, the pilot episode leaked online [189]\n\n\nHome media\nThe first

The Walking Dead have been well reviewed by recognized critics, while the seventh and eighth seasons received more mixed reviews On Rotten Tomatoes, the series has an average score of 80%

Lindsay Putnam of the New York Post questioned whether the show was in danger of becoming \"too diverse\" as the show \"seemingly reached critical mass for its nonwhite, nonmale survivors — and now has no choice but to kill them off\" [238] Robert Kirkman has discussed the increasing diversity of the show and the comic books He has described how he regrets the lack of diversity in the early issues of the comic book series and explained how they would have been \"vastly more diverse\" if he were to have started them now [241]\n\n\nRatings\nDuring its first season, The Walking Dead attracted between four and six million viewers [242] Viewership began to increase in its second season During seasons three to seven, it attracted ten to seventeen million viewers [242] In 2012, during its third season, it became the first cable series in television history to have the highest total viewership of any series during the fall season among 18- to 49-year-old adults [242] [243] In 2014, total viewership for the show's fifth-season premiere was 17.3 million, making it the most-watched series episode in cable history [244] [245] In 2016, a New York Times study of the 50

origins [4] [5] Wilson's two younger brothers, Dennis and Carl, were born in 1944 and 1946 [6] Shortly after Dennis' birth, the family moved from Inglewood to 3701 West 119th Street in nearby Hawthorne, California [7] [6] Wilson, along with his siblings, suffered psychological and sporadic physical maltreatment from their father [8] His 2016 memoir characterizes his father as \"violent\"

Centinela Hospital Medical Center in Inglewood, California, the first child of Audree Neva (née Korthof) and Murry Wilson, a machinist who later pursued songwriting part-time [2] [3] His ancestry

moved from Inglewood to 3701 West 119th Street in nearby Hawthorne, California [7] [6] Wilson, along with his siblings, suffered psychological and sporadic physical maltreatment from their father [8] His 2016 memoir characterizes his father as \"violent\" and \"cruel\"; however, it also suggests that certain narratives about the mistreatment had been overstated or unfounded [9]\n\n\nHigh school and college\nIn high school, Wilson played quarterback for Hawthorne High's football team, [29] played baseball for American Legion Ball, [5] and ran cross-country in his senior year [29] At 15, he briefly worked part-time sweeping at a jewelry store, his only paid employment before his success in music [30] [nb 4] He also cleaned for his father's machining company, ABLE, on weekends [32] Wilson auditioned to sing for the Original Sound Record Company's inaugural record release, \"Chapel of Love\" (unrelated to the 1964 song), but was deemed too young [33] For his 16th birthday, he received a portable two-track [34] Wollensak tape recorder, allowing him to experiment with recording songs, group vocals, and rudimentary production techniques [35] [24] Wilson involved his friends around the piano and would most frequently harmonize with those from his senior class in these recordings [36]\n\n\nFormation of the Beach Boys\nI wasn't aware those early songs defined California so well until much later in my career I certainly didn't set out to do it I wasn't into surfing at all My brother Dennis gave me all the jargon I needed to write\nthe songs He was the surfer and I was the songwriter.\n\n\n1962–1966: Peak years\nBrian Wilson is the Beach Boys He is the band We're his fucking messengers He is all of it Period We're nothing He's everything.\n\n\nEarly productions and freelancing\nAs a member of the Beach Boys, Wilson was signed by Capitol Records' Nick Venet to a seven-year contract in 1962 [57] [58] Recording sessions for the band's first album, Surfin' Safari, took place in Capitol's basement studios in the famous tower building in August, but early on Wilson lobbied for a different place to cut Beach Boys tracks The large rooms were built to record the big orchestras and ensembles of the 1950s, not small rock groups At Wilson's insistence, Capitol agreed to let the Beach Boys pay for their own outside recording sessions, to which Capitol would own all the rights [59] Additionally, during the taping of their first LP, Wilson fought for, and won, the right to helm the production — though this fact was not acknowledged with a production credit in the album liner notes [59] [60]\n\n\nInternational success and first nervous breakdown\nThroughout 1964, Wilson engaged in worldwide concert tours with the Beach Boys while continuing to write and produce for the group, whose studio output for this year included the albums Shut Down Volume 2 (March), All Summer Long (June), and The Beach Boys' Christmas Album (November) [98] Following a particularly stressful Australasian tour in early 1964, it was agreed by the group to dismiss Murry from his managerial duties [99] Murry still had a subsequent influence over the band's activities and kept a direct correspondence with Wilson, giving him thoughts about the group's decisions; [100] Wilson also periodically sought music opinions from his father [101]\n\n\nGrowing drug use and religious epiphany\nWith his bandmates often away on tour, Wilson distanced himself socially from the other Beach Boys [125] Since the autumn of 1964, he had moved from the Rovells' home to a one-bedroom apartment at 7235 Hollywood Boulevard, [126] and given his newfound independence, had begun forming a new social circle for himself through the industry connections he had accumulated [127] Biographer Steven Gaines writes, \"Brian had total freedom from family restraints for the first time  [...] he was finally able to make a new set of friends without parental interference.\" [127] By Gary Usher's account, Wilson had had few close friends and was \"like a piece of clay waiting to be molded\" [128] By the end of the year, Wilson was one of the most successful, influential, and sought-after young musicians in Los Angeles [129] However, a wider public recognition of Wilson's talents eluded him until 1966 [130]\n\n\nPet Sounds, \"genius\" campaign, and Smile\nWilson recalled that after relocating to his Laurel Way home, he experienced an unexpected surge of creativity at his \"big Spanish table\", where he sat for hours developing ideas for new music He said, \"I was taking a lot of drugs, fooling around with pills, a lot of pills, and it fouled me up for a while It got me really introspective\" [146] Over a period of five months, he planned an album that would reflect his growing interest in \"the making of music for people on a spiritual level\" [146]\n\n\n1966–1973: Decline\nSmile was never finished, due in large part to Wilson's worsening mental condition and exhaustion [162] His friends, family, and colleagues often date the project's unraveling and Wilson's onset of erratic behavior to around November 1966—namely, when he recorded the would-be album track \"Mrs O'Leary's Cow\" (or \"Fire\") [167] In April 1967, Wilson and his wife put their Laurel Way home up for sale and took residence at a newly purchased mansion on 10452 Bellagio Road in Bel Air [166] [168] [nb 11] Wilson also set to work on constructing a personal home studio [166] By then, most of his new contacts had disassociated or were exiled from his social circle [170]\n\n\nHome studio transition\nSmile was never finished, due in large part to Wilson's worsening mental condition and exhaustion [162] His friends, family, and colleagues often date the project's unraveling and Wilson's onset of erratic behavior to around November 1966—namely, when he recorded the would-be album track \"Mrs O'Leary's Cow\" (or \"Fire\") [167] In April 1967, Wilson and his wife put their Laurel Way home up for sale and took residence at a newly purchased mansion on 10452 Bellagio Road in Bel Air [166] [168] [nb 11] Wilson also set to work on constructing a personal home studio [166] By then, most of his new contacts had disassociated or were exiled from his social circle [170]\n\n\nInstitutionalization and \"Bedroom Tapes\"\nFor the remainder of 1968, Wilson's songwriting output declined substantially, as did his emotional state, leading him to self-medicate with the excessive consumption of food, alcohol, and drugs [186] Amid the looming financial insolvency of the Beach Boys, he began to supplement his regular use of amphetamines and marijuana with cocaine [187] Hutton, who had introduced Wilson to cocaine, [188] recalled that Wilson expressed suicidal wishes at the time, and that it was when his \"real decline started\" [187]\n\n\nRadiant Radish and Sunflower\nEarly in 1969, the Beach Boys commenced recording their album Sunflower (August 1970) [198] Wilson was an active participant in the year-long sessions, writing more than an album's worth of material by himself or with collaborators, most of which was left off the record [197] He recorded a single for the band, \"Break Away\", that was co-written with his father, after which he was rarely in the studio until August 1969 [199] Due to his poor reputation in the music industry, the Beach Boys struggled to secure a record contract with another label [200] In May, he revealed to reporters that the group were on the verge of bankruptcy [201] His remarks had the effect of ruining negotiations with Deutsche Grammophon [202] and nearly compromised the band's imminent tour of the UK and Europe [203] In July, Wilson opened a short-lived health food store, the Radiant Radish, with his friend Arnie Geller and cousin Steve Korthof [204]\n\n\nSpring and Holland stay\nWilson was deeply affected by the poor commercial response to Sunflower [218] and resumed having minimal contributions to the Beach Boys' records [219] Bruce Johnston characterized him as merely \"a visitor\" to the sessions for Surf's Up (August 1971) [220] In November 1970, Wilson joined the live band for one-and-a-half dates at the Whisky a Go Go [221] [nb 16] Following this, Wilson told Melody Maker that although he had been \"quite happy living at home\", he felt that he was \"not as creative as I once was and I'm not participating as much as I should have done.\" [222] He identified himself as \"a kind of drop-out\" who sleeps into the afternoon and \"potter [s] around doing nothing much.\" [222]\n\n\n1973–1975: Recluse period\nI was taking some drugs and I experimented myself right out of action  [...] I'd sometimes go and record But basically I just stayed in my bedroom I was under the sheets and I watched television.\n\n\n1975–1982: \"Brian's Back!\"\nWilson's overconsumption of food, cigarettes, alcohol, and other drugs—which now sometimes included heroin—further strained his marriage to Marilyn, who responded by threatening her husband with divorce or committing him to a mental institution [236] By then, Wilson's weight had ballooned to 240 pounds (110 kg) [262] [263] [nb 20] To help reverse his physical decline, in 1975, band manager Stephen Love appointed his brother Stan, a basketball player, as Wilson's bodyguard, trainer, and caretaker [264] [265] [nb 21] Marilyn also called in the band's lawyers and accountants to remind her husband that, pursuant to the terms of his contract with Warner Bros., he was legally obliged to write and produce for the Beach Boys or else he would be sued by the label and lose his home [264] [nb 22] Stan was successful in improving Wilson's health but after several months, went back to working with the NBA [264] Wilson then volunteered into psychologist Eugene Landy's radical 24-hour therapy program in October [267] [268]\n\n\n15 Big Ones, Love You, and Adult/Child\nWilson's overconsumption of food, cigarettes, alcohol, and other drugs—which now sometimes included heroin—further strained his marriage to Marilyn, who responded by threatening her husband with divorce or committing him to a mental institution [236] By then, Wilson's weight had ballooned to 240 pounds (110 kg) [262] [263] [nb 20] To help reverse his physical decline, in 1975, band manager Stephen Love appointed his brother Stan, a basketball player,

after several months, went back to working with the NBA [264] Wilson then volunteered into psychologist Eugene Landy's radical 24-hour therapy program in October [267] [268]\n\n\nHospitalizations and \"cocaine sessions\"\nWilson entered a period of regression over the subsequent years [279]—particularly, after the band's disastrous tour of Australia in 1978—and found ways of obtaining cocaine and barbiturates without the knowledge of his handlers [297] In mid-1978, a day after he overdosed on a combination of drugs, he disappeared from his family and went hitchhiking in West Hollywood, ultimately arriving at a gay bar, where he played piano for drinks [298] After this, he was driven to Mexico by a bar patron, and then hitchhiked to San Diego [299] Days later, police officers discovered Wilson lying under a tree in Balboa Park without shoes, money, or a wallet [299] They promptly took him to Alvarado Hospital for detox from alcohol poisoning [300] [301] Once discharged, Wilson immediately joined his bandmates for the recording of L.A (Light Album) (March 1979), but after producing some demos and early recordings, requested that Bruce Johnston helm the project [302] Korthof recalled that Wilson had been \"real depressed\" during the proceedings [303]\n\n\n1982–1991: Second Landy intervention\nIn 1982, after Wilson overdosed on a combination of alcohol, cocaine, and other psychoactive drugs, [323] his family and management successfully coordinated an elaborate ruse to convince him to volunteer back into Landy's program [324] [325] When approached by the band, Landy had agreed to treat Wilson again, but only if he was to be given total control over Wilson's affairs without interference from anyone [325] Additionally, Landy promised that he would need no more than two years to rehabilitate Wilson [326] On November 5, Wilson was falsely told by the group that he was penniless and no longer a member of the Beach Boys, and if he wanted to continue receiving his share of income from the touring band's earnings, he had to reenlist Landy as his caretaker [324]\n\n\nRecovery and the Wilson Project\nIn 1982, after Wilson overdosed on a combination of alcohol, cocaine, and other psychoactive drugs, [323] his family and management successfully coordinated an elaborate ruse to convince him to volunteer back into Landy's program [324] [325] When approached by the band, Landy had agreed to treat Wilson again, but only if he was to be given total control over Wilson's affairs without interference from anyone [325] Additionally, Landy promised

wanted to continue receiving his share of income from the touring band's earnings, he had to reenlist Landy as his caretaker [324]\n\n\nBrian Wilson and Sweet Insanity\nDuring this period, Wilson occasionally joined his bandmates at concerts, and he performed his first gig as a solo artist at several charity concerts around Los Angeles [340] In January 1987, Wilson agreed to a solo contract offered by Sire Records president Seymour Stein, who stipulated his own choice of co-producer, multi-instrumentalist Andy Paley, to keep Wilson on-task [335] [338] In exchange, Landy was allowed to take on an \"executive producer\" role [335] Other producers, including Russ Titelman and Lenny Waronker, were soon involved, and difficulties between them and Landy ensued throughout the recording sessions [341]\n\n\nLawsuits and conservatorship\nThroughout the 1990s, Wilson was embroiled in numerous lawsuits [348] In August 1989, he filed a $100 million suit against Irving Music to recover the song publishing rights that had been sold by his father decades earlier [338] Although Wilson failed to recover the rights, he was awarded $10 million through an out of court settlement in April 1992 [348]\n\n\n1992–2019: Career resurgence and touring\nWilson's productivity increased significantly following his disassociation from Landy [354] The day after the restraining order had been placed on Landy, Wilson had renewed his songwriting partnership with Andy Paley and, together, subsequently wrote and recorded a large collection of material for a proposed Beach Boys album throughout the early to mid-1990s [355] Concurrently, Wilson worked with Don Was on a documentary about his life, Brian Wilson: I Just Wasn't Made for These Times (1995) [356] The soundtrack consisted of rerecordings of Beach Boys songs and was released as Wilson's second solo album in August [357] In 1993, Wilson accepted an offer to record an album of songs written by Van Dyke Parks [358] Credited to the pair, Orange Crate Art was released in October 1995 [357] [359] In the late 1990s, Wilson and Asher rekindled their writing partnership and wrote some songs together [360] One of them \"Everything I Need\", appeared on The Wilsons (1997), a project by his daughters Carnie and Wendy and featuring select appearances and contributions from Wilson [360]\n\n\nPaley sessions, Orange Crate Art, and Imagination\nWilson's productivity increased significantly following his disassociation from Landy [354] The day after the restraining order had been placed on Landy, Wilson had renewed his

Wilsons (1997), a project by his daughters Carnie and Wendy and featuring select appearances and contributions from Wilson [360]\n\n\nLive albums and Brian Wilson Presents Smile\nEarly in 2000, Wilson released his first live album, Live at the Roxy Theatre [377] Later in the year, he embarked on a series of U.S concert dates that included the first full live performances of Pet Sounds, with Wilson backed by a 55-piece orchestra Van Dyke Parks was commissioned to write an overture arrangement of Wilson's songs [378] Critic Geoff Edgers wrote that the historical importance of the tour was comparable to that of Syd Barrett or J.D Salinger emerging from their decades-long reclusion [379] Although the tour was positively received by critics, it was poorly attended, and financial losses ran up to hundreds of thousands of dollars [377] In March 2001, Wilson attended a tribute show held in his honor at the Radio City Music Hall in New York, [380] where he sang \"Heroes and Villains\" before a public audience for the first time in decades [381]\n\n\nCovers albums, That Lucky Old Sun, and Beach Boys reunion\nIn October 2005, Arista Records released Wilson's album What I Really Want for Christmas, which contained two new originals by Wilson [402] To celebrate the 40th anniversary of Pet Sounds, Wilson embarked on a brief tour in November 2006 [403] Al Jardine accompanied Wilson for the tour [404] In 2007, the Southbank Centre in London commissioned Wilson to create another song cycle in the style of Smile With Scott Bennett, Wilson reconfigured a collection of songs that they had recently written and recorded together The result, That Lucky Old Sun, was a semi-autobiographical conceptual piece about California [405] One year after Wilson premiered the work in London, a studio-recorded version of the piece was released as his seventh solo album in September 2008 [406] It received generally favorable reviews [407]\n\n\nNo Pier Pressure and Pet Sounds 50th Anniversary World Tour\nIn June 2013, Wilson's website announced that he was recording and self-producing new material with Don Was, Al Jardine, David Marks, former Beach Boy Blondie Chaplin, and guitarist Jeff Beck [419] It stated that the material might be split into three albums: one of new pop songs, another of mostly instrumental tracks with Beck, and another of interwoven tracks dubbed \"the suite\" which initially began form as the closing four tracks of That's Why God Made the Radio [420] In January 2014, Wilson declared in an interview that the Beck collaborations would not be released [421] [422]\n\n\n2020s: At My Piano, UMPG sale, and dementia\nAround this time, Wilson had two back surgeries that left him unable to traverse without a walker [441] In 2019, Wilson postponed some concert dates due to worsening mental health His social media conveyed that he was grappling with unfamiliar internal struggles and occasionally speaking without intent, with the reason still uncertain [442] The next month, his social media declared that he had recovered and would resume touring [443]\n\n\nMusical influences\nChord-wise, Wilson's main music influences come from rock and roll, doo-wop, and vocal-based jazz [456] At about age two, he heard Glenn Miller's 1943 rendition of Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, which had a profound emotional impact on him [457] [458] Wilson said, \"It sort of became a general life theme  [for me].\" [459] As a child, his favorite artists included Roy Rogers, Carl Perkins, Bill Haley, Elvis Presley, Henry Mancini, and Rosemary Clooney [16] Asked for the first music that he had felt compelled to learn and sing repeatedly, Wilson answered with Haley's 1954 recording of \"Rock Around the Clock\" [245] Most of Wilson's education in music composition and jazz harmony came from deconstructing the harmonies of his favorite vocal group, the Four Freshmen, whose repertoire included songs by Gershwin, Jerome Kern, and Cole Porter [460] [nb 28]\n\n\nEarly influences\nChord-wise, Wilson's main music influences come from rock and roll, doo-wop, and vocal-based jazz [456] At about age two, he heard Glenn Miller's 1943 rendition of

1966 article, Wilson referred to Spector as \"the single most influential producer.\" [479] He reaffirmed in 2000 that Spector was \"probably the biggest influence of all .. Anybody with a good ear can hear that I was influenced by Spector I would listen to his records and pick up ideas.\" [480] Wilson particularly admired Spector's treatment of \"the song as one giant instrument .. Size was so important to him, how big everything sounded And he had the best drums I ever heard.\" [481] He often cited Spector's Christmas album as his favorite album of all time [482]\n\n\nOthers\nWilson's other significant musical influences include Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, [477] Nelson Riddle, [505] the Motown sound, [471] [nb 35] Disney film soundtracks such as Mary Poppins (1964), [507] and soul musicians such as Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder [508] Wendy Carlos' 1969 album Switched-On Bach, described by Wilson as \"one of the most electrifying records\" he had ever heard, [509] influenced his use of synthesizers [510]\n\n\nArtistry\nWilson's writing process, as he described in 1966, started with finding a basic chord pattern and rhythm that he termed \"feels\", or \"brief note sequences, fragments of ideas\" He explained, \"once they're out of my head and into the open air, I can see them and touch them firmly They're not 'feels' anymore.\" [522] [523] He wrote later that he aspired to write songs that appear \"simple, no matter how complex it really is.\" [524] In a 2009 interview, he stated that his favorite chord is E major seventh, while his favorite key signatures to play in are B, C♯, E, and E♭ [471]\n\n\nCompositional style\nWilson's writing process, as he described in 1966, started with finding a basic chord pattern and rhythm that he termed \"feels\", or \"brief note sequences, fragments of ideas\" He explained, \"once they're out of my head and into the open air, I can see them and touch them firmly They're not 'feels' anymore.\" [522] [523] He wrote later that he aspired to write songs that appear \"simple, no matter how complex it really is.\" [524] In a 2009 interview, he stated that his favorite chord is E major seventh, while his favorite key signatures to play in are B, C♯, E, and E♭ [471]\n\n\nLyrics\nWilson typically wrote songs in conjunction with another lyricist, [542] although there are exceptions in which he composed both the music and words alone, including \"Surfer Girl\", \"Girl Don't Tell Me\", \"I'm Bugged at My Ol' Man\", \"Busy Doin' Nothin'\", \"This Whole World\", \"'Til I Die\", and \"Love and Mercy\", among others [519] In his 2008 book Dark Mirror: The Pathology of the Singer-Songwriter, Donald Brackett identifies Wilson as \"the Carl Sandburg and Robert Frost of popular music—deceptively simple, colloquial in phrasing, with a spare and evocative lyrical style embedded in the culture that created it.\" [543]\n\n\nStudios and musicians\nWilson said, \"I was unable to really think as a producer up until the time where I really got familiar with Phil Spector's work That was when I started to design the experience to be a record rather than just a song.\" [554] He often attended Spector's recording sessions, taking notes on the producer's arranging and recording methods (later dubbed the \"Wall of Sound\"), and adopted the same choice of studios and session musicians as Spector [486] [nb 41] This collective of studio musicians later became known as the Wrecking Crew [556]\n\n\nProduction style\nSomebody could go in right after Brian's session and try to record, and they could never get the sound he got There was a lot of subtle stuff he did  [...] He was just hands-on He would change the reverb and the echo, and all of a sudden, something just – whoa! – got twice as big and fat.\n\n\nSinging\nThrough listening to Four Freshmen records, Wilson developed a distinctive singing style—a versatile head voice that allowed him to sing high without engaging in falsetto, although he did also sing in falsetto on some Beach Boys songs [467] Wilson recalled that he \"learned how to sing falsetto\" through listening to the Four Freshmen's renditions of songs like \"I'm Always Chasing Rainbows\", \"I'll Remember April\", and \"Day by Day\" [587] Another strong influence was Rosemary Clooney, who he said \"taught me to sing with love in my heart  [...] I would sing along with  [her recording of \"Hey There\"], studying her phrasing, and that's how I learned to sing with feeling.\" [588] In 1966, he said that the highest note he could sing was D5 [465]\n\n\nMental health\nWilson is diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and mild bipolar disorder [594] Since 1965, he has regularly experienced auditory hallucinations that present in the form of disembodied voices [595] These hallucinations are mainly derogatory, but sometimes positive, [596] [353] and have occasionally inspired songs [553] Wilson referred to the voices as \"heroes and villains\" that have caused \"a life of scare\" [597]\n\n\nOnset of illness\nWilson is diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and mild bipolar disorder [594] Since 1965, he has regularly experienced auditory hallucinations that present in the form of disembodied voices [595] These hallucinations are mainly derogatory, but sometimes positive, [596] [353] and have occasionally inspired songs [553] Wilson referred to the voices as \"heroes and villains\" that have caused \"a life of scare\" [597]\n\n\nPost-Landy\nFollowing the mid-1970s, Wilson was given the since-retracted diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia [594] He was given this diagnosis, in addition to manic-depressive psychosis, when he was a patient at Brotzman Memorial Hospital in 1978 [307] Landy, in 1976, had initially refuted such a diagnosis, suggesting Wilson's main issue was \"being scared\" [619] In 1984, doctors again misdiagnosed Wilson with schizophrenia, also finding evidence of brain damage caused by excessive and sustained drug use [620]\n\n\nPersonal life\nAt age 11, during a Christmas choir recital, it was found that Wilson had significantly diminished hearing in his right ear [588] The issue was diagnosed as a nerve impingement by a family doctor [625] The exact cause remains unclear, but possible causes include a birth defect, an injury from his father, Murry, or another child [625] [626] [19]\n\n\nDeafness in right ear\nAt age 11, during a Christmas choir recital, it was found that Wilson had significantly diminished hearing in his right ear [588] The issue was diagnosed as a nerve impingement by a family doctor [625] The exact cause remains unclear, but possible causes include a birth defect, an injury from his father, Murry, or another child [625] [626] [19]\n\n\nRelationships and children\nWilson's first serious relationship was with Judy Bowles, a high school student he had met at a baseball game in mid-1961 [633] The couple were engaged during Christmas 1963 and were to be married the following December [634] She inspired his songs \"Judy\" (1962), \"Surfer Girl\" (1963), and, according to some accounts, \"The Warmth of the Sun\" (1964), the latter being written shortly after they had separated [635] Around then, he had gradually become romantically involved with another high school student, singer Marilyn Rovell, whom he had met in August 1962 [636] [87] Wilson's \"All Summer Long\" (1964) referenced their first meeting with the lyric \"Remember when you spilled Coke all over your blouse?\" [637] [nb 52] Inspired by a remark from Marilyn's older sister Diane, Wilson wrote \"Don't Hurt My Little Sister\" (1965) about his early relationship with Marilyn [638] [639]\n\n\nBeliefs\nWilson was raised in a Presbyterian family [245] In many interviews, he has emphasized the spiritual essence of his music, particularly with Pet Sounds [666] He was also intrigued by astrology, numerology, and the occult, as reflected in his original concepts for Smile [667] In 1966, Wilson expressed his belief that all music \"starts with religion\", and while he recognized a \"higher being who is better than we are\", he was not traditionally religious [522] Asked whether his music was religiously influenced in 1988, he referred to the 1962 book A Toehold on Zen, explaining that he believed that he possessed what is called a \"toehold\", meaning that having \"a good grasp\" on one aspect of life can translate to others [668]\n\n\nInterviews\nHe is an artist wrapped densely in myth and enigma who, in person, in interview, creates as many questions as he answers Is this guy crazy, or is he crazy like a fox? Missing a synapse or just as sensitive as a raw nerve ending? Startlingly honest or putting you on? Childishly naïve or a master manipulator?\n\n\nCultural impact and influence\nFrom 1962 to 1979, Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than two dozen U.S Top 40 hits for the Beach Boys Eleven of those reached the top 10, including the number-ones \"I Get Around\" (1964), \"Help Me, Rhonda\" (1965), and \"Good Vibrations\" (1966) [688] [nb 63] Three more that he produced, but did not write, were the band's \"Barbara Ann\" (number 2) in 1965, \"Sloop John B\" (number 3) in 1966, and \"Rock and Roll Music\" (number 5) in 1976 [688] Among his other top 10 hits, Wilson co-wrote Jan and Dean's \"Surf City\" (the first chart-topping surf song) and \"Dead Man's Curve\" (number 8) in 1963, and the Hondells' \"Little Honda\" (number 9) in 1964 [689]\n\n\nSales achievements\nFrom 1962 to 1979, Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than two dozen U.S Top 40 hits for the Beach Boys Eleven of those reached the top 10, including the number-ones \"I Get Around\" (1964), \"Help Me, Rhonda\" (1965), and \"Good Vibrations\" (1966) [688] [nb 63] Three more that he produced, but did not write, were the band's \"Barbara Ann\" (number 2) in 1965, \"Sloop John B\" (number 3) in 1966, and \"Rock and Roll Music\" (number 5) in 1976 [688] Among his other top 10 hits, Wilson co-wrote Jan and Dean's \"Surf City\" (the first chart-topping surf song) and \"Dead Man's Curve\" (number 8) in 1963, and the Hondells' \"Little Honda\" (number 9) in 1964 [689]\n\n\nPopular music, industry practices, and record production\nWilson is widely regarded as one of the most innovative and significant songwriters of the late 20th century [690] Fellow composers who have acknowledged his advancements include Philip Glass, Gustavo Dudamel, and Burt Bacharach, the latter of whom praised Wilson as \"one of the greatest innovators\" in music history [691] In discussing Wilson's harmonic ingenuity,  musicologist Philip Lambert states in 2016 that his harmonic approach demonstrated an exceptional mastery and significantly expanded upon the British-American pop idiom of the 1960s, leaving a lasting imprint on popular music since [692]\n\n\nArt pop, pop art, psychedelia, and progressive music\nThere is no god and Brian Wilson is his son Brian Wilson stirred up the chords.\n\n\nNaïve art, rock/pop division, and outsider music\nWilson's popularity and success is attributed partly to the perceived naïveté of his work and personality [731] [732] [733] In music journalist Barney Hoskyns' description, the \"particular appeal of Wilson's genius\" can be traced to his \"singular naivety\" and \"ingenuousness\", alongside his band being \"the very obverse of hip\" [733] Commenting on the seemingly \"campy and corny\" quality of the Beach Boys' early records, David Marks said that Wilson had been \"dead serious about them all\", elaborating, \"It's hard to believe that anyone could be that naive and honest, but he was That's what made those records so successful You could feel the sincerity in them.\" [731] [732] John Cale supported, \"What Brian came to mean was an ideal of naïveté and innocence  [...] Pet Sounds was adult and childlike at the same time.\" [652] [nb 72]\n\n\nAlternative music and continued cultural resonance\nWilson has also been declared the \"godfather\" of punk, indie rock, and emo [738] Principally through his early records, Wilson, alongside his collaborator Mike Love, was a key influence on the development of punk rock and the movement's evolution into indie rock [745] [nb 74] According to critic Carl Wilson (no relation to the Beach Boys' Carl Wilson), \"The Ramones, for instance, seized on and subverted the early Wilson template: Be True to Your School became Rock'n'Roll High School.\" [747] The critic also notes, \"For the artier branches of post-punk, Wilson's pained vulnerability, his uses of offbeat instruments and his intricate harmonies, not to mention the Smile saga itself, became a touchstone\", especially for such bands as Pere Ubu, XTC, U2, R.E.M., the Pixies, and My Bloody Valentine [747]\n\n\nAuthorized documentary films\nFilm\n\n\nAccolades\nFilm\n\n\nAwards and honors\nFilm\n\n\nPolls and critics' rankings\nFilm\n\n\nDiscography\nFilm\n\n\nFilmography\nFilm\n\n\nSee also\nBooks\n\n\nNotes\nBooks\n\n\nReferences\nBooks\n\n\nBibliography\nBooks\n\n\nFurther reading\nBooks\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Brian Douglas Wilson is a renowned American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer, best known as the creative force and leader of the Beach Boys. He was born on June 20, 1942, at Centinela Hospital Medical Center in Inglewood, California, to Audree Neva (née Korthof) and Murry Wilson, a machinist who later pursued songwriting part-time.\n\n**Early Life and Family**\n\nWilson's ancestry includes Dutch, Scottish, English, German, Irish, and Swedish origins. His two younger brothers, Dennis and Carl, were born in 1944 and 1946, respectively. The family moved from Inglewood to 3701 West 119th Street in Hawthorne, California, shortly after Dennis' birth. Wilson's childhood was marked by psychological and physical maltreatment from his father, which has been the subject of controversy and debate. In his 2016 memoir, Wilson characterizes his father as \"violent\" and \"cruel,\" but also suggests that certain narratives about the mistreatment have been overstated or unfounded.\n\n**Childhood**\n\nAs a child, Wilson's father encouraged his musical talents, teaching him how to play the piano and introducing him to jazz and pop music. Wilson's favorite artists at the time included Roy Rogers, Carl Perkins, Bill Haley, Elvis Presley, Henry Mancini, and Rosemary Clooney. He has credited these early influences with shaping his musical style and taste.\n\n**High School and College**\n\nIn high school, Wilson played quarterback for the Hawthorne High football team, played baseball for the American Legion Ball, and ran cross-country in his senior year. At 15, he briefly worked part-time sweeping at a jewelry store, which was his only paid employment before his success in music. Wilson also cleaned for his father's machining company, ABLE, on weekends. He auditioned to sing for the Original Sound Record Company's inaugural record release, \"Chapel of Love,\" but was deemed too young.\n\n**Formation of the Beach Boys**\n\nI wasn't aware those early songs defined California so well until much later in my career. I certainly didn't set out to do it. My brother Dennis gave me all the jargon I needed to write the songs. He was the surfer, and I was the songwriter.\n\nIn 1962, Wilson joined the Beach Boys, a group formed by his brother, Brian, along with friends Mike Love, Al Jardine, and Dennis Wilson. The band's early sound was heavily influenced by surf rock, but Wilson soon began to experiment with more complex harmonies and arrangements.\n\n**Peak Years (1962-1966)**\n\nBrian Wilson is the Beach Boys. He is the band. We're his messengers. He is all of it. Period. We're nothing. He's everything.\n\nThroughout 1964, Wilson engaged in worldwide concert tours with the Beach Boys while continuing to write and produce for the group. The band's studio output for this year included the albums Shut Down Volume 2, All Summer Long, and The Beach Boys' Christmas Album. Following a particularly stressful Australasian tour in early 1964, it was agreed by the group to dismiss Murry from his managerial duties.\n\n**Growing Drug Use and Religious Epiphany**\n\nWith his bandmates often away on tour, Wilson distanced himself socially from the other Beach Boys. Since the autumn of 1964, he had moved from the Rovells' home to a one-bedroom apartment at 7235 Hollywood Boulevard, where he began forming a new social circle for himself through the industry connections he had accumulated. Wilson's overconsumption of food, cigarettes, alcohol, and other drugs, which now sometimes included heroin, further strained his marriage to Marilyn.\n\n**Institutionalization and \"Cocaine Sessions\"**\n\nIn 1968, Wilson entered a period of regression over the subsequent years, particularly after the band's disastrous tour of Australia in 1978. He disappeared from his family and went hitchhiking in West Hollywood, ultimately arriving at a gay bar, where he played piano for drinks. Following his mid-1970s diagnosis with paranoid schizophrenia, Wilson was given the since-retracted diagnosis of manic-depressive psychosis, with evidence of brain damage caused by excessive and sustained drug use.\n\n**Post-Landy**\n\nFollowing the mid-1970s, Wilson was given the since-retracted diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. He was given this diagnosis, in addition to manic-depressive psychosis, when he was a patient at Brotzman Memorial Hospital in 1978. Landy, in 1976, had initially refuted such a diagnosis, suggesting Wilson's main issue was \"being scared.\" In 1984, doctors again misdiagnosed Wilson with schizophrenia.\n\n**Personal Life and Relationships**\n\nAt age 11, during a Christmas choir recital, it was found that Wilson had significantly diminished hearing in his right ear. The issue was diagnosed as a nerve impingement by a family doctor. Wilson's first serious relationship was with Judy Bowles, a high school student he had met at a baseball game in mid-1961. The couple were engaged during Christmas 1963 and were to be married the following December. Wilson's \"All Summer Long\" (1964) referenced their first meeting with the lyric \"Remember when you spilled Coke all over your blouse?\"\n\n**Beliefs and Interviews**\n\nWilson was raised in a Presbyterian family. In many interviews, he has emphasized the spiritual essence of his music, particularly with Pet Sounds. He was also intrigued by astrology, numerology, and the occult, as reflected in his original concepts for Smile. Wilson has been described as an artist wrapped densely in myth and enigma, creating as many questions as he answers. He is a startlingly honest or putting-you-on kind of person, childishly naïve or a master manipulator.\n\n**Cultural Impact and Influence**\n\nFrom 1962 to 1979, Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than two dozen U.S Top 40 hits for the Beach Boys. Eleven of those reached the top 10, including the number-ones \"I Get Around\" (1964), \"Help Me, Rhonda\" (1965), and \"Good Vibrations\" (1966). Wilson is widely regarded as one of the most innovative and significant songwriters of the late 20th century. His harmonic ingenuity, significantly expanded upon the British-American pop idiom of the 1960s, leaving a lasting imprint on popular music since.\n\n**Naïve Art, Rock/Pop Division, and Outsider Music**\n\nWilson's popularity and success are attributed partly to the perceived naïveté of his work and personality. The Beach Boys' early records were described as \"campy and corny,\" but Wilson was dead serious about them. He was an ideal of naïveté and innocence, adult and childlike at the same time. Wilson has also been declared the \"godfather\" of punk, indie rock, and emo, with his early records influencing the development of these genres.\n\n**Authorized Documentary Films**\n\nBrian Wilson has been the subject of several documentary films, including \"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\" (1995) and \"Love and Mercy\" (2014).", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in

year [29] At 15, he briefly worked part-time sweeping at a jewelry store, his only paid employment before his success in music [30] [nb 4] He also cleaned for his father's machining company, ABLE, on weekends [32] Wilson auditioned to sing for the Original Sound Record Company's inaugural record release, \"Chapel of Love\" (unrelated to the 1964 song), but was deemed too young [33] For his 16th birthday, he received a portable two-track [34] Wollensak tape recorder, allowing him to experiment with recording songs, group vocals, and rudimentary production techniques [35] [24] Wilson involved his friends around the piano and would most frequently harmonize with those from his senior class in these recordings [36]\n\n\nFormation of the Beach Boys\nI wasn't aware those early songs defined California so well until much later in my career I certainly didn't set out to do it I wasn't into surfing at all My brother Dennis gave me all the jargon I needed to write\nthe songs He was the

productions and freelancing\nAs a member of the Beach Boys, Wilson was signed by Capitol Records' Nick Venet to a seven-year contract in 1962 [57] [58] Recording sessions for the band's first album, Surfin' Safari, took place in Capitol's basement studios in the famous tower building in August, but early on Wilson lobbied for a different place to cut Beach Boys tracks The large rooms were built to record the big orchestras and ensembles of the 1950s, not small rock groups At Wilson's insistence, Capitol agreed to let the Beach Boys pay for their own outside recording sessions, to which Capitol would own all the rights [59] Additionally, during the taping of their first LP, Wilson fought for, and won, the right to helm the production — though this fact was not acknowledged with a production credit in the album liner notes [59] [60]\n\n\nInternational success and first nervous breakdown\nThroughout 1964, Wilson engaged in worldwide concert tours with the Beach Boys while continuing to write and produce for the group, whose studio output for this year included the albums Shut Down Volume 2 (March), All Summer Long (June), and The Beach Boys' Christmas Album (November) [98] Following a particularly stressful Australasian tour in early 1964, it was agreed by the group to dismiss Murry from his managerial duties [99] Murry still had a subsequent influence over the band's activities and kept a direct correspondence with Wilson, giving him thoughts about the group's decisions; [100] Wilson also periodically sought music opinions from his father [101]\n\n\nGrowing drug use and religious epiphany\nWith his bandmates often away on tour, Wilson distanced himself socially from the other Beach Boys [125] Since the autumn of 1964, he had moved from the Rovells' home to a one-bedroom apartment at 7235 Hollywood Boulevard, [126] and given his newfound independence, had begun forming a new social circle for himself through the industry connections he had accumulated [127] Biographer Steven Gaines writes, \"Brian had total freedom from family restraints for the first time  [...] he was finally able to make a new set of friends without parental interference.\" [127] By Gary Usher's account, Wilson had had few close friends and was \"like a piece of clay waiting to be molded\" [128] By the end of the year, Wilson was one of the most successful, influential, and sought-after young musicians in Los Angeles [129] However, a wider public recognition of Wilson's talents eluded him until 1966 [130]\n\n\nPet Sounds, \"genius\" campaign, and Smile\nWilson recalled that after relocating to his Laurel Way home, he experienced an unexpected surge of creativity at his \"big Spanish table\", where he sat for hours developing ideas for new music He said, \"I was taking a lot of drugs, fooling around with pills, a lot of pills, and it fouled me up for a while It got me really introspective\" [146] Over a period of five months, he planned an album that would reflect his growing interest in \"the making of music for people on a spiritual level\" [146]\n\n\n1966–1973: Decline\nSmile was never finished, due in large part to Wilson's worsening mental condition and exhaustion [162] His friends, family, and colleagues often date the project's unraveling and Wilson's onset of erratic behavior to around November 1966—namely, when he recorded the would-be album track \"Mrs O'Leary's Cow\" (or \"Fire\") [167] In April 1967, Wilson and his wife put their Laurel Way home up for sale and took residence at a newly purchased mansion on 10452 Bellagio Road in Bel Air [166] [168] [nb 11] Wilson also set to work on constructing a personal home studio [166] By then, most of his new contacts had disassociated or were exiled from his social circle [170]\n\n\nHome studio transition\nSmile was never finished, due in large part to Wilson's worsening mental condition and exhaustion [162] His friends, family, and colleagues often date the project's unraveling and Wilson's onset of erratic behavior to around November 1966—namely, when he recorded the would-be album track \"Mrs O'Leary's Cow\" (or \"Fire\") [167] In April 1967, Wilson and his wife put their Laurel Way home up for sale and took residence at a newly purchased mansion on 10452 Bellagio Road in Bel Air [166] [168] [nb 11] Wilson also set to work on constructing a personal home studio [166] By then, most of his new contacts had disassociated or were exiled from his social circle [170]\n\n\nInstitutionalization and \"Bedroom Tapes\"\nFor the remainder of 1968, Wilson's songwriting output declined substantially, as did his emotional state, leading him to self-medicate with the excessive consumption of food, alcohol, and drugs [186] Amid the looming financial insolvency of the Beach Boys, he began to supplement his regular use of amphetamines and marijuana with cocaine [187] Hutton, who had introduced Wilson to cocaine, [188] recalled that Wilson expressed suicidal wishes at the time, and that it was when his \"real decline started\" [187]\n\n\nRadiant Radish and Sunflower\nEarly in 1969, the Beach Boys commenced recording their album Sunflower (August 1970) [198] Wilson was an active participant in the year-long sessions, writing more than an album's worth of material by himself or with collaborators, most of which was left off the record [197] He recorded a single for the band, \"Break Away\", that was co-written with his father, after which he was rarely in the studio until August 1969 [199] Due to his poor reputation in the music industry, the Beach Boys struggled to secure a record contract with another label [200] In May, he revealed to reporters that the group were on the verge of bankruptcy [201] His remarks had the effect of ruining negotiations with Deutsche Grammophon [202] and nearly compromised the band's imminent tour of the UK and Europe [203] In July, Wilson opened a short-lived health food store, the Radiant Radish, with his friend Arnie Geller and cousin Steve Korthof [204]\n\n\nSpring and Holland stay\nWilson was deeply affected by the poor commercial response to Sunflower [218] and resumed having minimal contributions to the Beach Boys' records [219] Bruce Johnston characterized him as merely \"a visitor\" to the sessions for Surf's Up (August 1971) [220] In November 1970, Wilson joined the live band for one-and-a-half dates at the Whisky a Go Go [221] [nb 16] Following this, Wilson told Melody Maker that although he had been \"quite happy living at home\", he felt that he was \"not as creative as I once was and I'm not participating as much as I should have done.\" [222] He identified himself as \"a kind of drop-out\" who sleeps into the afternoon and \"potter [s] around doing nothing much.\" [222]\n\n\n1973–1975: Recluse period\nI was taking some drugs and I experimented myself right out of action  [...] I'd sometimes go and record But basically I just stayed in my bedroom I was under the sheets and I watched television.\n\n\n1975–1982: \"Brian's Back!\"\nWilson's overconsumption of food, cigarettes, alcohol, and other drugs—which now sometimes included heroin—further strained his marriage to Marilyn, who responded by threatening her husband with divorce or committing him to a mental institution [236] By then, Wilson's weight had ballooned to 240 pounds (110 kg) [262] [263] [nb 20] To help reverse his physical decline, in 1975, band manager Stephen Love appointed his brother Stan, a basketball player, as Wilson's bodyguard, trainer, and caretaker [264] [265] [nb 21] Marilyn also called in the band's lawyers and accountants to remind her husband that, pursuant to the terms of his contract with Warner Bros., he was legally obliged to write and produce for the Beach Boys or else he would be sued by the label and lose his home [264] [nb 22] Stan was successful in improving Wilson's health but after several months, went back to working with the NBA [264] Wilson then volunteered into psychologist Eugene Landy's radical 24-hour therapy program in October [267] [268]\n\n\n15 Big Ones, Love You, and Adult/Child\nWilson's overconsumption of food, cigarettes, alcohol, and other drugs—which now sometimes included heroin—further strained his marriage to Marilyn, who responded by threatening her husband with divorce or committing him to a mental institution [236] By then, Wilson's weight had ballooned to 240 pounds (110 kg) [262] [263] [nb 20] To help reverse his physical decline, in 1975, band manager Stephen Love appointed his brother Stan, a basketball player, as Wilson's bodyguard, trainer, and caretaker [264] [265] [nb 21] Marilyn also called in the band's lawyers and accountants to remind her husband that, pursuant to the terms of his contract with Warner Bros., he was legally obliged to write and produce for the Beach Boys or else he would be sued by the label and lose his home [264] [nb 22] Stan was successful in improving

[268]\n\n\nHospitalizations and \"cocaine sessions\"\nWilson entered a period of regression over the subsequent years [279]—particularly, after the band's disastrous tour of Australia in 1978—and found ways of obtaining cocaine and barbiturates without the knowledge of his handlers [297] In mid-1978, a day after he overdosed on a combination of drugs, he disappeared from his family and went hitchhiking in West Hollywood, ultimately arriving at a gay bar, where he played piano for drinks [298] After this, he was driven to Mexico by a bar patron, and then hitchhiked to San Diego [299] Days later, police officers discovered Wilson lying under a tree in Balboa Park without shoes, money, or a wallet [299] They promptly took him to Alvarado Hospital for detox from alcohol poisoning [300] [301] Once discharged, Wilson immediately joined his bandmates for the recording of L.A (Light Album) (March 1979), but after producing some demos and early recordings, requested that Bruce Johnston helm the project [302] Korthof recalled that Wilson had been \"real depressed\" during the proceedings [303]\n\n\n1982–1991: Second Landy intervention\nIn 1982, after Wilson overdosed on a combination of alcohol, cocaine, and other psychoactive drugs, [323] his family and management successfully coordinated an elaborate ruse to convince him to volunteer back into Landy's program [324] [325] When approached by the band, Landy had agreed to treat Wilson again, but only if he was to be given total control over Wilson's affairs without interference from anyone [325] Additionally, Landy promised that he would need no more than two years to rehabilitate Wilson [326] On November 5, Wilson was falsely told by the group that he was penniless and no longer a member of the Beach Boys, and if he wanted to continue receiving his share of income from the touring band's earnings, he had to reenlist Landy as his caretaker [324]\n\n\nRecovery and the Wilson Project\nIn 1982, after Wilson overdosed on a combination of alcohol, cocaine, and other psychoactive drugs, [323] his family and management successfully coordinated an elaborate ruse to convince him to volunteer back into Landy's program [324] [325] When approached by the band, Landy had agreed to treat Wilson again, but only if he was to be given total control over Wilson's affairs without interference from anyone [325] Additionally,

Boys, and if he wanted to continue receiving his share of income from the touring band's earnings, he had to reenlist Landy as his caretaker [324]\n\n\nBrian Wilson and Sweet Insanity\nDuring this period, Wilson occasionally joined his bandmates at concerts, and he performed his first gig as a solo artist at several charity concerts around Los Angeles [340] In January 1987, Wilson agreed to a solo contract offered by Sire Records president Seymour Stein, who stipulated his own choice of co-producer, multi-instrumentalist Andy Paley, to keep Wilson on-task [335] [338] In exchange, Landy was allowed to take on an \"executive producer\" role [335] Other producers, including Russ Titelman and Lenny Waronker, were soon involved, and difficulties between them and Landy ensued throughout the recording sessions [341]\n\n\nLawsuits and conservatorship\nThroughout the 1990s, Wilson was embroiled in numerous lawsuits [348] In August 1989, he filed a $100 million suit against Irving Music to recover the song publishing rights that had been sold by his father decades earlier [338] Although Wilson failed to recover the rights, he was awarded $10 million through an out of court settlement in April 1992 [348]\n\n\n1992–2019: Career resurgence and touring\nWilson's productivity increased significantly following his disassociation from Landy [354] The day after the restraining order had been placed on Landy, Wilson had renewed his songwriting partnership with Andy Paley and, together, subsequently wrote and recorded a large collection of material for a proposed Beach Boys album throughout the early to mid-1990s [355] Concurrently, Wilson worked with Don Was on a documentary about his life, Brian Wilson: I Just Wasn't Made for These Times (1995) [356] The soundtrack consisted of rerecordings of Beach Boys songs and was released as Wilson's second solo album in August [357] In 1993, Wilson accepted an offer to record an album of songs written by Van Dyke Parks [358] Credited to the pair, Orange Crate Art was released in October 1995 [357] [359] In the late 1990s, Wilson and Asher rekindled their writing partnership and wrote some songs together [360] One of them \"Everything I Need\", appeared on The Wilsons (1997), a project by his daughters Carnie and Wendy and featuring select appearances and contributions from Wilson [360]\n\n\nPaley sessions, Orange Crate Art, and Imagination\nWilson's productivity increased significantly following his disassociation from Landy [354] The day after the restraining order had been placed on Landy, Wilson had renewed

Wilsons (1997), a project by his daughters Carnie and Wendy and featuring select appearances and contributions from Wilson [360]\n\n\nLive albums and Brian Wilson Presents Smile\nEarly in 2000, Wilson released his first live album, Live at the Roxy Theatre [377] Later in the year, he embarked on a series of U.S concert dates that included the first full live performances of Pet Sounds, with Wilson backed by a 55-piece orchestra Van Dyke Parks was commissioned to write an overture arrangement of Wilson's songs [378] Critic Geoff Edgers wrote that the historical importance of the tour was comparable to that of Syd Barrett or J.D Salinger emerging from their decades-long reclusion [379] Although the tour was positively received by critics, it was poorly attended, and financial losses ran up to hundreds of thousands of dollars [377] In March 2001, Wilson attended a tribute show held in his honor at the Radio City Music Hall in New York, [380] where he sang \"Heroes and Villains\" before a public audience for the first time in decades [381]\n\n\nCovers albums, That Lucky Old Sun, and Beach Boys reunion\nIn October 2005, Arista Records released Wilson's album What I Really Want for Christmas, which contained two new originals by Wilson [402] To celebrate the 40th anniversary of Pet Sounds, Wilson embarked on a brief tour in November 2006 [403] Al Jardine accompanied Wilson for the tour [404] In 2007, the Southbank Centre in London commissioned Wilson to create another song cycle in the style of Smile With Scott Bennett, Wilson reconfigured a collection of songs that they had recently written and recorded together The result, That Lucky Old Sun, was a semi-autobiographical conceptual piece about California [405] One year after Wilson premiered the work in London, a studio-recorded version of the piece was released as his seventh solo album in September 2008 [406] It received generally favorable reviews [407]\n\n\nNo Pier Pressure and Pet Sounds 50th Anniversary World Tour\nIn June 2013, Wilson's website announced that he was recording and self-producing new material with Don Was, Al Jardine, David Marks, former Beach Boy Blondie Chaplin, and guitarist Jeff Beck [419] It stated that the material might be split into three albums: one of new pop songs, another of mostly instrumental tracks with Beck, and another of interwoven tracks dubbed \"the suite\" which initially began form as the closing four tracks of That's Why God Made the Radio [420] In January 2014, Wilson declared in an interview that the Beck collaborations would not be released [421] [422]\n\n\n2020s: At My Piano, UMPG sale, and dementia\nAround this time, Wilson had two back surgeries that left him unable to traverse without a walker [441] In 2019, Wilson postponed some concert dates due to worsening mental health His social media conveyed that he was grappling with unfamiliar internal struggles and occasionally speaking without intent, with the reason still uncertain [442] The next month, his social media declared that he had recovered and would resume touring [443]\n\n\nMusical influences\nChord-wise, Wilson's main music influences come from rock and roll, doo-wop, and vocal-based jazz [456] At about age two, he heard Glenn Miller's 1943 rendition of Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, which had a profound emotional impact on him [457] [458] Wilson said, \"It sort of became a general life theme  [for me].\" [459] As a child, his favorite artists included Roy Rogers, Carl Perkins, Bill Haley, Elvis Presley, Henry Mancini, and Rosemary Clooney [16] Asked for the first music that he had felt compelled to learn and sing repeatedly, Wilson answered with Haley's 1954 recording of \"Rock Around the Clock\" [245] Most of Wilson's education in music composition and jazz harmony came from deconstructing the harmonies of his favorite vocal group, the Four Freshmen, whose repertoire included songs by Gershwin, Jerome Kern, and Cole Porter [460] [nb

1966 article, Wilson referred to Spector as \"the single most influential producer.\" [479] He reaffirmed in 2000 that Spector was \"probably the biggest influence of all .. Anybody with a good ear can hear that I was influenced by Spector I would listen to his records and pick up ideas.\" [480] Wilson particularly admired Spector's treatment of \"the song as one giant instrument .. Size was so important to him, how big everything sounded And he had the best drums I ever heard.\" [481] He often cited Spector's Christmas album as his favorite album of all time [482]\n\n\nOthers\nWilson's other significant musical influences include Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, [477] Nelson Riddle, [505] the Motown sound, [471] [nb 35] Disney film soundtracks such as Mary Poppins (1964), [507] and soul musicians such as Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder [508] Wendy Carlos' 1969 album Switched-On Bach, described by Wilson as \"one of the most electrifying records\" he had ever heard, [509] influenced his use of synthesizers [510]\n\n\nArtistry\nWilson's writing process, as he described in 1966, started with finding a basic chord pattern and rhythm that he termed \"feels\", or \"brief note sequences, fragments of ideas\" He explained, \"once they're out of my head and into the open air, I can see them and touch them firmly They're not 'feels' anymore.\" [522] [523] He wrote later that he aspired to write songs that appear \"simple, no matter how complex it really is.\" [524] In a 2009 interview, he stated that his favorite chord is E major seventh, while his favorite key signatures to play in are B, C♯, E, and E♭ [471]\n\n\nCompositional style\nWilson's writing process, as he described in 1966, started with finding a basic chord pattern and rhythm that he termed \"feels\", or \"brief note sequences, fragments of ideas\" He explained, \"once they're out of my head and into the open air, I can see them and touch them firmly They're not 'feels' anymore.\" [522] [523] He wrote later that he aspired to write songs that appear \"simple, no matter how complex it really is.\" [524] In a 2009 interview, he stated that his favorite chord is E major seventh, while his favorite key signatures to play in are B, C♯, E, and E♭ [471]\n\n\nLyrics\nWilson typically wrote songs in conjunction with another lyricist, [542] although there are exceptions in which he composed both the music and words alone, including \"Surfer Girl\", \"Girl Don't Tell Me\", \"I'm Bugged at My Ol' Man\", \"Busy Doin' Nothin'\", \"This Whole World\", \"'Til I Die\", and \"Love and Mercy\", among others [519] In his 2008 book Dark Mirror: The Pathology of the Singer-Songwriter, Donald Brackett identifies Wilson as \"the Carl Sandburg and Robert Frost of popular music—deceptively simple, colloquial in phrasing, with a spare and evocative lyrical style embedded in the culture that created it.\" [543]\n\n\nStudios and musicians\nWilson said, \"I was unable to really think as a producer up until the time where I really got familiar with Phil Spector's work That was when I started to design the experience to be a record rather than just a song.\" [554] He often attended Spector's recording sessions, taking notes on the producer's arranging and recording methods (later dubbed the \"Wall of Sound\"), and adopted the same choice of studios and session musicians as Spector [486] [nb 41] This collective of studio musicians later became known as the Wrecking Crew [556]\n\n\nProduction style\nSomebody could go in right after Brian's session and try to record, and they could never get the sound he got There was a lot of subtle stuff he did  [...] He was just hands-on He would change the reverb and the echo, and all of a sudden, something just – whoa! – got twice as big and fat.\n\n\nSinging\nThrough listening to Four Freshmen records, Wilson developed a distinctive singing style—a versatile head voice that allowed him to sing high without engaging in falsetto, although he did also sing in falsetto on some Beach Boys songs [467] Wilson recalled that he \"learned how to sing falsetto\" through listening to the Four Freshmen's renditions of songs like \"I'm Always Chasing Rainbows\", \"I'll Remember April\", and \"Day by Day\" [587] Another strong influence was Rosemary Clooney, who he said \"taught me to sing with love in my heart  [...] I would sing along with  [her recording of \"Hey There\"], studying her phrasing, and that's how I learned to sing with feeling.\" [588] In 1966, he said that the highest note he could sing was D5 [465]\n\n\nMental health\nWilson is diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and mild bipolar disorder [594] Since 1965, he has regularly experienced auditory hallucinations that present in the form of disembodied voices [595] These hallucinations are mainly derogatory, but sometimes positive, [596] [353] and have occasionally inspired songs [553] Wilson referred to the voices as \"heroes and villains\" that have caused \"a life of scare\" [597]\n\n\nOnset of illness\nWilson is diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and mild bipolar disorder [594] Since 1965, he has regularly experienced auditory hallucinations that present in the form of disembodied voices [595] These hallucinations are mainly derogatory, but sometimes positive, [596] [353] and have occasionally inspired songs [553] Wilson referred to the voices as \"heroes and villains\" that have caused \"a life of scare\" [597]\n\n\nPost-Landy\nFollowing the mid-1970s, Wilson was given the since-retracted diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia [594] He was given this diagnosis, in addition to manic-depressive psychosis, when he was a patient at Brotzman Memorial Hospital in 1978 [307] Landy, in 1976, had initially refuted such a diagnosis, suggesting Wilson's main issue was \"being scared\" [619] In 1984, doctors again misdiagnosed Wilson with schizophrenia, also finding evidence of brain damage caused by excessive and sustained drug use [620]\n\n\nPersonal life\nAt age 11, during a Christmas choir recital, it was found that Wilson had significantly diminished hearing in his right ear [588] The issue was diagnosed as a nerve impingement by a family doctor [625] The exact cause remains unclear, but possible causes include a birth defect, an injury from his father, Murry, or another child [625] [626] [19]\n\n\nDeafness in right ear\nAt age 11, during a Christmas choir recital, it was found that Wilson had significantly diminished hearing in his right ear [588] The issue was diagnosed as a nerve impingement by a family doctor [625] The exact cause remains unclear, but possible causes include a birth defect, an injury from his father, Murry, or another child [625] [626] [19]\n\n\nRelationships and children\nWilson's first serious relationship was with Judy Bowles, a high school student he had met at a baseball game in mid-1961 [633] The couple were engaged during Christmas 1963 and were to be married the following December [634] She inspired his songs \"Judy\" (1962), \"Surfer Girl\" (1963), and, according to some accounts, \"The Warmth of the Sun\" (1964), the latter being written shortly after they had separated [635] Around then, he had gradually become romantically involved with another high school student, singer Marilyn Rovell, whom he had met in August 1962 [636] [87] Wilson's \"All Summer Long\" (1964) referenced their first meeting with the lyric \"Remember when you spilled Coke all over your blouse?\" [637] [nb 52] Inspired by a remark from Marilyn's older sister Diane, Wilson wrote \"Don't Hurt My Little Sister\" (1965) about his early relationship with Marilyn [638] [639]\n\n\nBeliefs\nWilson was raised in a Presbyterian family [245] In many interviews, he has emphasized the spiritual essence of his music, particularly with Pet Sounds [666] He was also intrigued by astrology, numerology, and the occult, as reflected in his original concepts for Smile [667] In 1966, Wilson expressed his belief that all music \"starts with religion\", and while he recognized a \"higher being who is better than we are\", he was not traditionally religious [522] Asked whether his music was religiously influenced in 1988, he referred to the 1962 book A Toehold on Zen, explaining that he believed that he possessed what is called a \"toehold\", meaning that having \"a good grasp\" on one aspect of life can translate to others [668]\n\n\nInterviews\nHe is an artist wrapped densely in myth and enigma who, in person, in interview, creates as many questions as he answers Is this guy crazy, or is he crazy like a fox? Missing a synapse or just as sensitive as a raw nerve ending? Startlingly honest or putting you on? Childishly naïve or a master manipulator?\n\n\nCultural impact and influence\nFrom 1962 to 1979, Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than two dozen U.S Top 40 hits for the Beach Boys Eleven of those reached the top 10, including the number-ones \"I Get Around\" (1964), \"Help Me, Rhonda\" (1965), and \"Good Vibrations\" (1966) [688] [nb 63] Three more that he produced, but did not write, were the band's \"Barbara Ann\" (number 2) in 1965, \"Sloop John B\" (number 3) in 1966, and \"Rock and Roll Music\" (number 5) in 1976 [688] Among his other top 10 hits, Wilson co-wrote Jan and Dean's \"Surf City\" (the first chart-topping surf song) and \"Dead Man's Curve\" (number 8) in 1963, and the Hondells' \"Little Honda\" (number 9) in 1964 [689]\n\n\nSales achievements\nFrom 1962 to 1979, Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than two dozen U.S Top 40 hits for the Beach Boys Eleven of those reached the top 10, including the number-ones \"I Get Around\" (1964), \"Help Me, Rhonda\" (1965), and \"Good Vibrations\" (1966) [688] [nb 63] Three more that he produced, but did not write, were the band's \"Barbara Ann\" (number 2) in 1965, \"Sloop John B\" (number 3) in 1966, and \"Rock and Roll Music\" (number 5) in 1976 [688] Among his other top 10 hits, Wilson co-wrote Jan and Dean's \"Surf City\" (the first chart-topping surf song) and \"Dead Man's Curve\" (number 8) in 1963, and the Hondells' \"Little Honda\" (number 9) in 1964 [689]\n\n\nPopular music, industry practices, and record production\nWilson is widely regarded as one of the most innovative and significant songwriters of the late 20th century [690] Fellow composers who have acknowledged his advancements include Philip Glass, Gustavo Dudamel, and Burt Bacharach, the latter of whom praised Wilson as \"one of the greatest innovators\" in music history [691] In discussing Wilson's harmonic ingenuity,  musicologist Philip Lambert states in 2016 that his harmonic approach demonstrated an exceptional mastery and significantly expanded upon the British-American pop idiom of the 1960s, leaving a lasting imprint on popular music since [692]\n\n\nArt pop, pop art, psychedelia, and progressive music\nThere is no god and Brian Wilson is his son Brian Wilson stirred up the chords.\n\n\nNaïve art, rock/pop division, and outsider music\nWilson's popularity and success is attributed partly to the perceived naïveté of his work and personality [731] [732] [733] In music journalist Barney Hoskyns' description, the \"particular appeal of Wilson's genius\" can be traced to his \"singular naivety\" and \"ingenuousness\", alongside his band being \"the very obverse of hip\" [733] Commenting on the seemingly \"campy and corny\" quality of the Beach Boys' early records, David Marks said that Wilson had been \"dead serious about them all\", elaborating, \"It's hard to believe that anyone could be that naive and honest, but he was That's what made those records so successful You could feel the sincerity in them.\" [731] [732] John Cale supported, \"What Brian came to mean was an ideal of naïveté and innocence  [...] Pet Sounds was adult and childlike at the same time.\" [652] [nb 72]\n\n\nAlternative music and continued cultural resonance\nWilson has also been declared the \"godfather\" of punk, indie rock, and emo [738] Principally through his early records, Wilson, alongside his collaborator Mike Love, was a key influence on the development of punk rock and the movement's evolution into indie rock [745] [nb 74] According to critic Carl Wilson (no relation to the Beach Boys' Carl Wilson), \"The Ramones, for instance, seized on and subverted the early Wilson template: Be True to Your School became Rock'n'Roll High School.\" [747] The critic also notes, \"For the artier branches of post-punk, Wilson's pained vulnerability, his uses of offbeat instruments and his intricate harmonies, not to mention the Smile saga itself, became a touchstone\", especially for such bands as Pere Ubu, XTC, U2, R.E.M., the Pixies, and My Bloody Valentine [747]\n\n\nAuthorized documentary films\nFilm\n\n\nAccolades\nFilm\n\n\nAwards and honors\nFilm\n\n\nPolls and critics' rankings\nFilm\n\n\nDiscography\nFilm\n\n\nFilmography\nFilm\n\n\nSee also\nBooks\n\n\nNotes\nBooks\n\n\nReferences\nBooks\n\n\nBibliography\nBooks\n\n\nFurther reading\nBooks\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

prehistorical finds in the state from the Middle and Upper Paleolithic dated to 21,000–31,000 years old [20] and Mesolithic/Microlithic hunter-gatherer settlement, near Pratapgarh, from around 10550–9550 BCE Villages with domesticated cattle, sheep, and goats and evidence of agriculture began as early as 6000 BCE, and gradually developed between c 4000 and 1500 BCE beginning with the Indus Valley Civilisation and Harappa culture to the Vedic period and extending into the Iron Age [21] [22] [23]\n\n\nPrehistory\nModern human hunter-gatherers have been in Uttar Pradesh [16] [17] [18] since between around [19] 85,000 and 72,000 years ago There have also been prehistorical finds in the state from the Middle and Upper Paleolithic dated to 21,000–31,000 years old [20] and Mesolithic/Microlithic hunter-gatherer settlement, near Pratapgarh, from around 10550–9550 BCE Villages with domesticated cattle, sheep, and goats and evidence of agriculture began as early as 6000 BCE, and gradually developed between c 4000 and 1500 BCE beginning with the Indus Valley Civilisation and Harappa culture to the Vedic period and extending into the Iron Age [21] [22] [23]\n\n\nAncient and classical period\nOut of the sixteen mahajanapadas (lit 'great realms') or oligarchic republics that existed in ancient India, seven fell entirely within the present-day boundaries of the state [24] The kingdom of Kosala, in the Mahajanapada era, was also located within the regional boundaries of modern-day Uttar Pradesh [25] According to Hinduism, the divine King Rama of the Ramayana epic reigned in Ayodhya, the capital of Kosala [26] Krishna, another divine king of Hindu legend, who plays a key role in the Mahabharata epic and is revered as the eighth reincarnation (Avatar) of the Hindu god Vishnu, is said to have been born in the city of Mathura [25] The aftermath of the Kurukshetra War is believed to have taken place in the area between the Upper Doab and Delhi, (in what was Kuru Mahajanapada), during the reign of the Pandava King Yudhishthira The kingdom of the Kurus corresponds to the Black and Red Ware and Painted Gray Ware culture and the beginning of the Iron Age in northwest India, around 1000 BCE [25]\n\n\nDelhi Sultanate\nUttar Pradesh was partially or entirely ruled by the Delhi Sultanate for 320 years (1206–1526) Five dynasties ruled over the Delhi Sultanate sequentially: the Mamluk dynasty (1206–90), the Khalji dynasty (1290–1320), the Tughlaq dynasty (1320–1414), the Sayyid dynasty (1414–51), and the Lodi dynasty (1451–1526) [34] [35]\n\n\nMedieval and early modern period\nIn the 16th century, Babur, a Timurid descendant of Timur and Genghis Khan from Fergana Valley (modern-day Uzbekistan), swept across the Khyber Pass and founded the Mughal Empire, covering India, along with modern-day Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh [38] The Mughals were descended from Persianised Central Asian Turks (with significant Mongol admixture) In the Mughal era, Uttar Pradesh became the heartland of the empire [30] Mughal emperors Babur and Humayun ruled from Delhi [39] [40] In 1540 an Afghan, Sher Shah Suri, took over the reins of Uttar Pradesh after defeating the Mughal King Humanyun [41] Sher Shah and his son Islam Shah ruled Uttar Pradesh from their capital at Gwalior [42] After the death of Islam Shah Suri, his prime minister Hemu became the de facto ruler of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and the western parts of Bengal He was bestowed the title of Hemchandra Vikramaditya (title of Vikramāditya adopted from Vedic period) at his formal coronation took place at Purana Qila in Delhi on 7 October 1556 A month later, Hemu died in the Second Battle of Panipat, and Uttar Pradesh came under Emperor Akbar's rule [43] Akbar ruled from Agra and Fatehpur Sikri [44]\n\n\nBritish India era\nStarting from Bengal in the second half of the 18th century, a series of battles for north Indian lands finally gave the British East India Company accession over the state's territories [47] Ajmer and Jaipur kingdoms were also included in this northern territory, which was named the \"North-Western Provinces\" (of Agra) Although UP later became the fifth-largest state of India, NWPA was one of the smallest states of the British Indian empire [48] Its capital shifted twice between Agra and Allahabad [49]\n\n\nPost-independence\nAfter India's independence, the United Provinces were renamed \"Uttar Pradesh\" (lit. 'northern province'), preserving UP as the abbreviation of the state's name, [60] [61] with the change coming into effect on 24 January 1950 [1] The new state was formed after the merger of several princely states and territories, including the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, and the Delhi territory The state has provided nine of India's prime ministers which is more than any other state and is the source of the largest number of seats in the Lok Sabha Despite its political influence since ancient times, its poor record in economic development and administration, poor governance, organised crime and corruption have kept it among India's backward states The state has been affected by repeated episodes of caste-related and communal violence [62] In December 1992 the disputed Babri Mosque located in Ayodhya was demolished by Hindu activists, leading to widespread violence across India [63] In 2000, northern districts of the state were separated to form the state of Uttarakhand [64]\n\n\nGeography\nUttar Pradesh, with a total area of 240,928 square kilometres (93,023 sq mi), is India's fourth-largest state in terms of land area and is roughly of same size as United Kingdom It is situated on the northern spout of India and shares an international boundary with Nepal The Himalayas border the state on the north, [65] but the plains that cover most of the state are distinctly different from those high mountains [66] The larger Gangetic Plain region is in the north; it includes the Ganges-Yamuna Doab, the Ghaghra plains, the Ganges plains and the Terai [67] The smaller Vindhya Range and plateau region are in the south [68] It is characterised by hard rock strata and a varied topography of hills, plains, valleys and plateaus The Bhabhar tract gives place to the terai area which is covered with tall elephant grass and thick forests interspersed with marshes and swamps [69] [70] The sluggish rivers of the bhabhar deepen in this area, their course running through a tangled mass of thick undergrowth The terai runs parallel to the bhabhar in a thin strip The entire alluvial plain is divided into three sub-regions [71] The first in the eastern tract consisting of 14 districts which are subject to periodical floods and droughts and have been classified as scarcity areas These districts have the highest density of population which gives the lowest per capita land The other two regions, the central and the western, are comparatively better with a well-developed irrigation system [72] They suffer from waterlogging and large-scale user tracts [73] In addition, the area is fairly arid The state has more than 32 large and small rivers; of them, the Ganga, Yamuna, Saraswati, Sarayu, Betwa, and Ghaghara are larger and of religious importance in Hinduism [74]\n\n\nClimate\nUttar Pradesh has a humid subtropical climate and experiences four seasons [80] The winter in January and February is followed by summer between March and May and the monsoon season between June and September [81] Summers are extreme with temperatures fluctuating anywhere between 0–50 °C (32–122 °F) in parts of the state coupled with dry hot winds called the Loo [82] The Gangetic plain varies from semiarid to sub-humid [81] The mean annual rainfall ranges from 650 mm (26 inches) in the southwest corner of the state to 1,000 mm (39 inches) in the eastern and south eastern parts of the state [83] Primarily a summer phenomenon, the Bay of Bengal branch of the Indian monsoon is the major bearer of rain in most parts of state After summer it is the southwest monsoon which brings most of the rain here, while in winters rain due to the western disturbances and north-east monsoon also contribute small quantities towards the overall precipitation of the state [80] [84]\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nUttar Pradesh has an abundance of natural resources [88] In 2011, the recorded forest area in the state was 16,583 km2 (6,403 sq mi) which is about 6.9% of the state's geographical area [89] In spite of rapid deforestation and poaching of wildlife, a diverse flora and fauna continue to exist in the state Uttar Pradesh is a habitat for 4.2% of all species of Algae recorded in India, 6.4% of Fungi, 6.0% of Lichens, 2.9% of Bryophytes, 3.3% of Pteridophytes, 8.7% of Gymnosperms, 8.1% of Angiosperms [90] Several species of trees, large and small mammals, reptiles, and insects are found in the belt of temperate upper mountainous forests Medicinal plants are found in the wild [91] and are also grown in plantations The Terai–Duar savanna and grasslands support cattle Moist deciduous trees grow in the upper Gangetic plain, especially along its riverbanks This plain supports a wide variety of plants and animals The Ganges and its tributaries are the habitat of large and small reptiles, amphibians, fresh-water fish, and crabs Scrubland trees such as the Babool (Vachellia nilotica) and animals such as the Chinkara (Gazella bennettii) are found in the arid Vindhyas [92] [93] Tropical dry deciduous forests are found in all parts of the plains Since much sunlight reaches the ground, shrubs and grasses are also abundant [94] Large tracts of these forests have been cleared for cultivation Tropical thorny forests, consisting of widely scattered thorny trees, mainly babool are mostly found in the southwestern parts of the state [95]\n\n\nDivisions, districts and cities\nUttar Pradesh is divided into 75 districts under these 18 divisions: [105]\n\n\nDemographics\nReligion in Uttar Pradesh (2011) [120]\n\n\nGovernance and administration\nThe state is governed by a parliamentary system of representative democracy Uttar Pradesh is one of the seven states in India, where the state legislature is bicameral, comprising two houses: the Vidhan Sabha (Legislative Assembly) and the Vidhan Parishad (Legislative Council) [143] [144] The Legislative Assembly consists of 404 members who are elected for five-year terms The Legislative Council is a permanent body of 100 members with one-third (33 members) retiring every two years The state sends the largest number of legislators to the national Parliament [145] The state contributes 80 seats to Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament, and 31 seats to Rajya Sabha, the upper house [146] [147]\n\n\nCrime and accidents\nAccording to the National Human Rights Commission of India (NHRC), Uttar Pradesh tops the list of states of encounter killings and custodial deaths [161] In 2014, the state recorded 365 judicial deaths out of a total 1,530 deaths recorded in the country [162] NHRC further said, of the over 30,000 murders registered in the country in 2016, Uttar Pradesh had 4,889 cases [163] A data from Minister of Home Affairs (MHA) avers, Bareilly recorded the highest number of custodial death at 25, followed by Agra (21), Allahabad (19) and Varanasi (9) National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data from 2011 says, the state has the highest number of crimes among any state in India, but due to its high population, the actual per capita crime rate is low [164] The state also continues to top the list of states with maximum communal violence incidents An analysis of Ministers of State of Home Affairs states (2014), 23 per cent of all incidents of communal violence in India took place in the state [165] [166] According to a research assembled by State Bank of India, Uttar Pradesh failed to improve its Human Development Index (HDI) ranking over a period of 27 years (1990–2017) [167] Based on sub-national human development index data for Indian states from 1990 to 2017, the report also stated that the value of human development index has steadily increased over time from 0.39 in 1990 to 0.59 in 2017 [168] [169] [170] The Uttar Pradesh Police, governed by the Department of Home and Confidential, is the largest police force in the world [171] [172] [173]\n\n\nEconomy\nfigures in crores of Indian rupees\n\n\nTransportation\nThe state has the largest railway network in the country but in relative terms has only sixth-highest railway density despite its plain topography and largest population As of 2015 [update], there were 9,077 km (5,640 mi) of rail in the state [213] [214] The railway network in the state is controlled by two divisions of the Indian Railways viz North Central Railway and North Eastern Railway Allahabad is the headquarters of the North Central Railway [215] and Gorakhpur is the headquarters of the North Eastern Railway [216] [217] Lucknow and Moradabad serve as divisional Headquarters of the Northern Railway Division Lucknow Swarna Shatabdi Express, the second fastest Shatabdi Express train, connects the Indian capital of New Delhi to Lucknow while Kanpur Shatabdi Express, connects New Delhi to Kanpur Central This was the first train in India to get the new German LHB coaches [218] The railway stations of Prayagraj Junction, Agra Cantonment, Lucknow Charbagh, Gorakhpur Junction, Kanpur Central, Mathura Junction and Varanasi Junction are included in the Indian Railways list of 50 world-class railway stations [219] The Lucknow Metro, along with the Kanpur Metro (Orange line), are rapid transit systems that serve Lucknow and Kanpur, respectively.\n\n\nSports\nTraditional sports, now played mostly as a pastime, include wrestling, swimming, kabaddi, and track-sports or water-sports played according to local traditional rules and without modern equipment Some sports are designed to display martial skills such as using a sword or 'Pata' (stick) [235] Due to a lack of organised patronage and requisite facilities, these sports survive mostly as individuals' hobbies or local competitive events Among modern sports, field hockey is popular and Uttar Pradesh has produced top-level players in India, such as Nitin Kumar and Lalit Kumar Upadhyay [236]\n\n\nEducation\nUttar Pradesh has a prolonged tradition of education, although historically it was primarily confined to the elite class and religious schools [247] Sanskrit-based learning formed the major part of education from the Vedic to the Gupta periods As cultures travelled through the region they brought their bodies of knowledge with them, adding Pali, Persian and Arabic scholarship to the community These formed the core of Hindu-Buddhist-Muslim education until the rise of British colonialism The present schools-to-university system of education owes its inception and development in the state (as in the rest of the country) to foreign Christian missionaries and the British colonial administration [248] Schools in the state are either managed by the government or by private trusts Hindi is used as a medium of instruction in most of the schools except those affiliated to the CBSE or the council for ICSE boards [249] Under the 10+2+3 plan, after completing secondary school, students typically enroll for two years in a junior college, also known as pre-university, or in schools with a higher secondary facility affiliated with the Uttar Pradesh Board of High School and Intermediate Education (commonly referred to as U.P Board) or a central board Students choose from one of three streams, namely liberal arts, commerce, or science Upon completing the required coursework, students may enrol in general or professional degree programs In a study done by Child Rights and You (CRY) and the Centre for Budgets, Governance, and Accountability (CBGA), Uttar Pradesh spent ₹9,167 per pupil, which is below the national average of ₹12,768 [250] The pupil/teacher ratio is 39:1, [b] lower than the national average of 23:1 [251] According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the state reported the second-highest teacher absenteeism (31 percent) in rural public schools among 19 surveyed states [252] According to an answer given by the Union Education Minister in 2020 in the Lok Sabha, about 17.1 percent of all elementary teacher posts in government schools in Uttar Pradesh are vacant In terms of absolute numbers, the figure stands at 210,000 [253] In February 2024, the Uttar Pradesh government informed legislative assembly that, 85,152 posts of headmasters and assistant teachers are vacant in the state [254]\n\n\nTourism\nUttar Pradesh ranks first in domestic tourist arrivals among all states of India [266] [267] Some 44,000 foreign tourists arrived in the state in 2021, and almost 110 million domestic tourists [268] The Taj Mahal attracts some 7 million people a year, earning almost ₹78 crore (US$9.3 million) in ticket sales in 2018–19 [269] The state is home to three World Heritage Sites: the Taj Mahal, [270] Agra Fort, [271] and the nearby Fatehpur Sikri [272]\n\n\nHealthcare\nUttar Pradesh has a mix of public as well as private healthcare infrastructure Public healthcare in Uttar Pradesh is provided through a grid of primary health centers, community health centers, district hospitals, and medical colleges Although an extensive network of public and private sector healthcare providers has been built, the available health infrastructure is inadequate to meet the demand for health services in the state [288] In 15 years to 2012–13, the population increased by more than 25 per cent The public health centres, which are the frontline of the government's health care system, decreased by 8 per cent [289] Smaller sub-centres, the first point of public contact, increased by no more than 2 per cent over the 25 years to 2015, a period when the population grew by more than 51 per cent [289] The state is also facing challenges such as a shortage of healthcare professionals, increasing cost of healthcare, a lack of essential medicines and equipment, the mushrooming of private healthcare and a lack of planning [290] The number of doctors registered with State Medical Councils or the Medical Council of India in Uttar Pradesh was 77,549 [291] As of 2019 [update], the number of government hospital in rural and urban areas of Uttar Pradesh stood at 4,442 with 39,104 beds and 193 with 37,156 beds respectively The average population served per government hospital stands at 47,782 individuals [292] As of December 2023 [update], Out-of-pocket expenditures in Uttar Pradesh is ₹60,883 crore (US$7.3 billion), highest in India [293]\n\n\nCulture\nSeveral texts and hymns of the Vedic literature were composed in Uttar Pradesh Renowned Indian writers who have resided in Uttar Pradesh were Kabir, Ravidas, and Tulsidas, who wrote much of his Ram Charit Manas in Varanasi The festival of Guru Purnima is dedicated to Sage Vyasa, and also known as Vyasa Purnima as it is the day which is believed to be his birthday and also the day he divided the Vedas [300]\n\n\nLanguage and literature\nSeveral texts and hymns of the Vedic literature were composed in Uttar Pradesh

and also known as Vyasa Purnima as it is the day which is believed to be his birthday and also the day he divided the Vedas [300]\n\n\nMusic and dance\nWith each district of Uttar Pradesh having its unique music and tradition, traditional folk music in Uttar Pradesh has been categorised in three different ways including music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers and music performed by custom During the medieval period, two distinct types of music began to emerge in Uttar Pradesh One was the courtly music, which received support from cities like Agra, Fatehpur Sikri, Lucknow, Jaunpur, Varanasi, and Banda The other was the religious music stemming from the Bhakti Cult, which thrived in places like Mathura, Vrindavan, and Ayodhya [305] The popular folk music of Uttar Pradesh includes sohar, which is sung to celebrate the birth of a child Evolved into the form of semi-classical singing, Kajari sung during the rainy season, and its singing style is closely associated the Benares gharana [306] Ghazal, Thumri and Qawwali which is a form of Sufi poetry is popular in the Awadh region, Rasiya (especially popular in Braj), which celebrate the divine love of Radha and Krishna Khayal is a form of semi-classical singing which comes from the courts of Awadh Other forms of music are Biraha, Chaiti, Chowtal, Alha, and Sawani [305]\n\n\nFairs and festivals\nChhath Puja is the biggest festival of eastern Uttar Pradesh [312] The Kumbh Mela, organised in the month of Maagha (February—March), is a major festival held every twelve years in rotation at Prayagraj on the river Ganges [313] Lathmar Holi is a local celebration of the Hindu festival of Holi It takes place well before the actual Holi in the town of Barsana near Mathura [314] Taj Mahotsav, held annually at Agra, is a colourful display of the culture of the Braj area [315] Ganga Mahotsav, a festival of Kartik Purnima, is celebrated fifteen days after Diwali [316]\n\n\nCuisine\nMughlai cuisine is a style of cooking developed in the Indian subcontinent by the imperial kitchens of the Mughal Empire It represents the cooking styles used in North India, especially Uttar Pradesh, and has been strongly influenced by Central Asian cuisine Awadhi cuisine from the city of Lucknow consists of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes It has been greatly influenced by Mughlai cuisine [317]\n\n\nSee

been prehistorical finds in the state from the Middle and Upper Paleolithic dated to 21,000–31,000 years old [20] and Mesolithic/Microlithic hunter-gatherer settlement, near Pratapgarh, from around 10550–9550 BCE Villages with domesticated cattle, sheep, and goats and evidence of agriculture began as early as 6000 BCE, and gradually developed between c 4000 and 1500 BCE beginning with the Indus Valley Civilisation and Harappa culture to the Vedic period and extending into the Iron Age [21] [22] [23]\n\n\nPrehistory\nModern human hunter-gatherers have been in Uttar Pradesh [16] [17] [18] since between around [19] 85,000 and 72,000 years ago There have also been prehistorical finds in the state from the Middle and Upper Paleolithic dated to 21,000–31,000 years old [20] and Mesolithic/Microlithic hunter-gatherer settlement, near Pratapgarh, from around 10550–9550 BCE Villages with domesticated cattle, sheep, and goats and evidence of agriculture began as early as 6000 BCE, and gradually developed between c 4000 and 1500 BCE beginning with the Indus Valley Civilisation and Harappa culture to the Vedic period and extending into the Iron Age [21] [22] [23]\n\n\nAncient and classical period\nOut of the sixteen mahajanapadas (lit 'great realms') or oligarchic republics that existed in ancient India, seven fell entirely within the present-day boundaries of the state [24] The kingdom of Kosala, in the Mahajanapada era, was also located within the regional boundaries of modern-day Uttar Pradesh [25] According to Hinduism, the divine King Rama of the Ramayana epic reigned in Ayodhya, the capital of Kosala [26] Krishna, another divine king of Hindu legend, who plays a key role in the Mahabharata epic and is revered as the eighth reincarnation (Avatar) of the Hindu god Vishnu, is said to have been born in the city of Mathura [25] The aftermath of the Kurukshetra War is believed to have taken place in the area between the Upper Doab and Delhi, (in what was Kuru Mahajanapada), during the reign of the Pandava King Yudhishthira The kingdom of the Kurus corresponds to the Black and Red Ware and Painted Gray Ware culture and the beginning of the Iron Age in northwest India, around 1000 BCE [25]\n\n\nDelhi Sultanate\nUttar Pradesh was partially or entirely ruled by the Delhi Sultanate for 320 years (1206–1526) Five dynasties ruled over the Delhi Sultanate sequentially: the Mamluk dynasty (1206–90), the Khalji dynasty (1290–1320), the Tughlaq dynasty (1320–1414), the Sayyid dynasty (1414–51), and the Lodi dynasty (1451–1526) [34] [35]\n\n\nMedieval and early modern period\nIn the 16th century, Babur, a Timurid descendant of Timur and Genghis Khan from Fergana Valley (modern-day Uzbekistan), swept across the Khyber Pass and founded the Mughal Empire, covering India, along with modern-day Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh [38] The Mughals were descended from Persianised Central Asian Turks (with significant Mongol admixture) In the Mughal era, Uttar Pradesh became the heartland of the empire [30] Mughal emperors Babur and Humayun ruled from Delhi [39] [40] In 1540 an Afghan, Sher Shah Suri, took over the reins of Uttar Pradesh after defeating the Mughal King Humanyun [41] Sher Shah and his son Islam Shah ruled Uttar Pradesh from their capital at Gwalior [42] After the death of Islam Shah Suri, his prime minister Hemu became the de facto ruler of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and the western parts of Bengal He was bestowed the title of Hemchandra Vikramaditya (title of Vikramāditya adopted from Vedic period) at his formal coronation took place at Purana Qila in Delhi on 7 October 1556 A month later, Hemu died in the Second Battle of Panipat, and Uttar Pradesh came under Emperor Akbar's rule [43] Akbar ruled from Agra and Fatehpur Sikri [44]\n\n\nBritish India era\nStarting from Bengal in the second half of the 18th century, a series of battles for north Indian lands finally gave the British East India Company accession over the state's territories [47] Ajmer and Jaipur kingdoms were also included in this northern territory, which was named the \"North-Western Provinces\" (of Agra) Although UP later became the fifth-largest state of India, NWPA was one of the smallest states of the British Indian empire [48] Its capital shifted twice between Agra and Allahabad [49]\n\n\nPost-independence\nAfter India's independence, the United Provinces were renamed \"Uttar Pradesh\" (lit. 'northern province'), preserving UP as the abbreviation of the state's name, [60] [61] with the change coming into effect on 24 January 1950 [1] The new state was formed after the merger of several princely states and territories, including the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, and the Delhi territory The state has provided nine of India's prime ministers which is more than any other state and is the source of the largest number of seats in the Lok Sabha Despite its political influence since ancient times, its poor record in economic development and administration, poor governance, organised crime and corruption have kept it among India's backward states The state has been affected by repeated episodes of caste-related and communal violence [62] In December 1992 the disputed Babri Mosque located in Ayodhya was demolished by Hindu activists, leading to widespread violence across India [63] In 2000, northern districts of the state were separated to form the state of Uttarakhand [64]\n\n\nGeography\nUttar Pradesh, with a total area of 240,928 square kilometres (93,023 sq mi), is India's fourth-largest state in terms of land area and is roughly of same size as United Kingdom It is situated on the northern spout of India and shares an international boundary with Nepal The Himalayas border the state on the north, [65] but the plains that cover most of the state are distinctly different from those high mountains [66] The larger Gangetic Plain region is in the north; it includes the Ganges-Yamuna Doab, the Ghaghra plains, the Ganges plains and the Terai [67] The smaller Vindhya Range and plateau region are in the south [68] It is characterised by hard rock strata and a varied topography of hills, plains, valleys and plateaus The Bhabhar tract gives place to the terai area which is covered with tall elephant grass and thick forests interspersed with marshes and swamps [69] [70] The sluggish rivers of the bhabhar deepen in this area, their course running through a tangled mass of thick undergrowth The terai runs parallel to the bhabhar in a thin strip The entire alluvial plain is divided into three sub-regions [71] The first in the eastern tract consisting of 14 districts which are subject to periodical floods and droughts and have been classified as scarcity areas These districts have the highest density of population which gives the lowest per capita land The other two regions, the central and the western, are comparatively better with a well-developed irrigation system [72] They suffer from waterlogging and large-scale user tracts [73] In addition, the area is fairly arid The state has more than 32 large and small rivers; of them, the Ganga, Yamuna, Saraswati, Sarayu, Betwa, and Ghaghara are larger and of religious importance in Hinduism [74]\n\n\nClimate\nUttar Pradesh has a humid subtropical climate and experiences four seasons [80] The winter in January and February is followed by summer between March and May and the monsoon season between June and September [81] Summers are extreme with temperatures fluctuating anywhere between 0–50 °C (32–122 °F) in parts of the state coupled with dry hot winds called the Loo [82] The Gangetic plain varies from semiarid to sub-humid [81] The mean annual rainfall ranges from 650 mm (26 inches) in the southwest corner of the state to 1,000 mm (39 inches) in the eastern and south eastern parts of the state [83] Primarily a summer phenomenon, the Bay of Bengal branch of the Indian monsoon is the major bearer of rain in most parts of state After summer it is the southwest monsoon which brings most of the rain here, while in winters rain due to the western disturbances and north-east monsoon also contribute small quantities towards the overall precipitation of the state [80] [84]\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nUttar Pradesh has an abundance of natural resources [88] In 2011, the recorded forest area in the state was 16,583 km2 (6,403 sq mi) which is about 6.9% of the state's geographical area [89] In spite of rapid deforestation and poaching of wildlife, a diverse flora and fauna continue to exist in the state Uttar Pradesh is a habitat for 4.2% of all species of Algae recorded in India, 6.4% of Fungi, 6.0% of Lichens, 2.9% of Bryophytes, 3.3% of Pteridophytes, 8.7% of Gymnosperms, 8.1% of Angiosperms [90] Several species of trees, large and small mammals, reptiles, and insects are found in the belt of temperate upper mountainous forests Medicinal plants are found in the wild [91] and are also grown in plantations The Terai–Duar savanna and grasslands support cattle Moist deciduous trees grow in the upper Gangetic plain, especially along its riverbanks This plain supports a wide variety of plants and animals The Ganges and its tributaries are the habitat of large and small reptiles, amphibians, fresh-water fish, and crabs Scrubland trees such as the Babool (Vachellia nilotica) and animals such as the Chinkara (Gazella bennettii) are found in the arid Vindhyas [92] [93] Tropical dry deciduous forests are found in all parts of the plains Since much sunlight reaches the ground, shrubs and grasses are also abundant [94] Large tracts of these forests have been cleared for cultivation Tropical thorny forests, consisting of widely scattered thorny trees, mainly babool are mostly found in the southwestern parts of the state [95]\n\n\nDivisions, districts and cities\nUttar Pradesh is divided into 75 districts under these 18 divisions: [105]\n\n\nDemographics\nReligion in Uttar Pradesh (2011) [120]\n\n\nGovernance and administration\nThe state is governed by a parliamentary system of representative democracy Uttar Pradesh is one of the seven states in India, where the state legislature is bicameral, comprising two houses: the Vidhan Sabha (Legislative Assembly) and the Vidhan Parishad (Legislative Council) [143] [144] The Legislative Assembly consists of 404 members who are elected for five-year terms The Legislative Council is a permanent body of 100 members with one-third (33 members) retiring every two years The state sends the largest number of legislators to the national Parliament [145] The state contributes 80 seats to Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament, and 31 seats to Rajya Sabha, the upper house [146] [147]\n\n\nCrime and accidents\nAccording to the National Human Rights Commission of India (NHRC), Uttar Pradesh tops the list of states of encounter killings and custodial deaths [161] In 2014, the state recorded 365 judicial deaths out of a total 1,530 deaths recorded in the country [162] NHRC further said, of the over 30,000 murders registered in the country in 2016, Uttar Pradesh had 4,889 cases [163] A data from Minister of Home Affairs (MHA) avers, Bareilly recorded the highest number of custodial death at 25, followed by Agra (21), Allahabad (19) and Varanasi (9) National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data from 2011 says, the state has the highest number of crimes among any state in India, but due to its high population, the actual per capita crime rate is low [164] The state also continues to top the list of states with maximum communal violence incidents An analysis of Ministers of State of Home Affairs states (2014), 23 per cent of all incidents of communal violence in India took place in the state [165] [166] According to a research assembled by State Bank of India, Uttar Pradesh failed to improve its Human Development Index (HDI) ranking over a period of 27 years (1990–2017) [167] Based on sub-national human development index data for Indian states from 1990 to 2017, the report also stated that the value of human development index has steadily increased over time from 0.39 in 1990 to 0.59 in 2017 [168] [169] [170] The Uttar Pradesh Police, governed by the Department of Home and Confidential, is the largest police force in the world [171] [172] [173]\n\n\nEconomy\nfigures in crores of Indian rupees\n\n\nTransportation\nThe state has the largest railway network in the country but in relative terms has only sixth-highest railway density despite its plain topography and largest population As of 2015 [update], there were 9,077 km (5,640 mi) of rail in the state [213] [214] The railway network in the state is controlled by two divisions of the Indian Railways viz North Central Railway and North Eastern Railway Allahabad is the headquarters of the North Central Railway [215] and Gorakhpur is the headquarters of the North Eastern Railway [216] [217] Lucknow and Moradabad serve as divisional Headquarters of the Northern Railway Division Lucknow Swarna Shatabdi Express, the second fastest Shatabdi Express train, connects the Indian capital of New Delhi to Lucknow while Kanpur Shatabdi Express, connects New Delhi to Kanpur Central This was the first train in India to get the new German LHB coaches [218] The railway stations of Prayagraj Junction, Agra Cantonment, Lucknow Charbagh, Gorakhpur Junction, Kanpur Central, Mathura Junction and Varanasi Junction are included in the Indian Railways list of 50 world-class railway stations [219] The Lucknow Metro, along with the Kanpur Metro (Orange line), are rapid transit systems that serve Lucknow and Kanpur, respectively.\n\n\nSports\nTraditional sports, now played mostly as a pastime, include wrestling, swimming, kabaddi, and track-sports or water-sports played according to local traditional rules and without modern equipment Some sports are designed to display martial skills such as using a sword or 'Pata' (stick) [235] Due to a lack of organised patronage and requisite facilities, these sports survive mostly as individuals' hobbies or local competitive events Among modern sports, field hockey is popular and Uttar Pradesh has produced top-level players in India, such as Nitin Kumar and Lalit Kumar Upadhyay [236]\n\n\nEducation\nUttar Pradesh has a prolonged tradition of education, although historically it was primarily confined to the elite class and religious schools [247] Sanskrit-based learning formed the major part of education from the Vedic to the Gupta periods As cultures travelled through the region they brought their bodies of knowledge with them, adding Pali, Persian and Arabic scholarship to the community These formed the core of Hindu-Buddhist-Muslim education until the rise of British colonialism The present schools-to-university system of education owes its inception and development in the state (as in the rest of the country) to foreign Christian missionaries and the British colonial administration [248] Schools in the state are either managed by the government or by private trusts Hindi is used as a medium of instruction in most of the schools except those affiliated to the CBSE or the council for ICSE boards [249] Under the 10+2+3 plan, after completing secondary school, students typically enroll for two years in a junior college, also known as pre-university, or in schools with a higher secondary facility affiliated with the Uttar Pradesh Board of High School and Intermediate Education (commonly referred to as U.P Board) or a central board Students choose from one of three streams, namely liberal arts, commerce, or science Upon completing the required coursework, students may enrol in general or professional degree programs In a study done by Child Rights and You (CRY) and the Centre for Budgets, Governance, and Accountability (CBGA), Uttar Pradesh spent ₹9,167 per pupil, which is below the national average of ₹12,768 [250] The pupil/teacher ratio is 39:1, [b] lower than the national average of 23:1 [251] According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the state reported the second-highest teacher absenteeism (31 percent) in rural public schools among 19 surveyed states [252] According to an answer given by the Union Education Minister in 2020 in the Lok Sabha, about 17.1 percent of all elementary teacher posts in government schools in Uttar Pradesh are vacant In terms of absolute numbers, the figure stands at 210,000 [253] In February 2024, the Uttar Pradesh government informed legislative assembly that, 85,152 posts of headmasters and assistant teachers are vacant in the state [254]\n\n\nTourism\nUttar Pradesh ranks first in domestic tourist arrivals among all states of India [266] [267] Some 44,000 foreign tourists arrived in the state in 2021, and almost 110 million domestic tourists [268] The Taj Mahal attracts some 7 million people a year, earning almost ₹78 crore (US$9.3 million) in ticket sales in 2018–19 [269] The state is home to three World Heritage Sites: the Taj Mahal, [270] Agra Fort, [271] and the nearby Fatehpur Sikri [272]\n\n\nHealthcare\nUttar Pradesh has a mix of public as well as private healthcare infrastructure Public healthcare in Uttar Pradesh is provided through a grid of primary health centers, community health centers, district hospitals, and medical colleges Although an extensive network of public and private sector healthcare providers has been built, the available health infrastructure is inadequate to meet the demand for health services in the state [288] In 15 years to 2012–13, the population increased by more than 25 per cent The public health centres, which are the frontline of the government's health care system, decreased by 8 per cent [289] Smaller sub-centres, the first point of public contact, increased by no more than 2 per cent over the 25 years to 2015, a period when the population grew by more than 51 per cent [289] The state is also facing challenges such as a shortage of healthcare professionals, increasing cost of healthcare, a lack of essential medicines and equipment, the mushrooming of private healthcare and a lack of planning [290] The number of doctors registered with State Medical Councils or the Medical Council of India in Uttar Pradesh was 77,549 [291] As of 2019 [update], the number of government hospital in rural and urban areas of Uttar Pradesh stood at 4,442 with 39,104 beds and 193 with 37,156 beds respectively The average population served per government hospital stands at 47,782 individuals [292] As of December 2023 [update], Out-of-pocket expenditures in Uttar Pradesh is ₹60,883 crore (US$7.3 billion), highest in India [293]\n\n\nCulture\nSeveral texts and hymns of the Vedic literature were composed in Uttar Pradesh Renowned Indian writers who have resided

and also known as Vyasa Purnima as it is the day which is believed to be his birthday and also the day he divided the Vedas [300]\n\n\nMusic and dance\nWith each district of Uttar Pradesh having its unique music and tradition, traditional folk music in Uttar Pradesh has been categorised in three different ways including music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers and music performed by custom During the medieval period, two distinct types of music began to emerge in Uttar Pradesh One was the courtly music, which received support from cities like Agra, Fatehpur Sikri, Lucknow, Jaunpur, Varanasi, and Banda The other was the religious music stemming from the Bhakti Cult, which thrived in places like Mathura, Vrindavan, and Ayodhya [305] The popular folk music of Uttar Pradesh includes sohar, which is sung to celebrate the birth of a child Evolved into the form of semi-classical singing, Kajari sung during the rainy season, and its singing style is closely associated the

{"title": "2023_Sudan_clashes", "content": "\nBackground\nSudan has been inhabited since prehistory and has seen many conflicts, with foreign invasions and resistance, ethnic tensions, religious disputes, and disputes over resources throughout antiquity and the middle ages [32] [33] Sudan was conquered by Egypt in 1821, and in 1881 the religious leader Muhammad Ahmad led a nationalist revolt and established an \"Islamic and national\" Mahdist State in much of the territory of modern Sudan [34] After Ahmad's death, a British-Egyptian force commanded by Lord Kitchener retook Sudan In 1899, the country became a condominium of Egypt and the United Kingdom, but was de facto ruled by the UK alone and would remain under British control until 1956, when it gained independence and inherited its pre-1911 borders In 1916, after the British government suspected that the Sultanate of Darfur was falling under the influence of the Ottoman government, an expedition was launched from Egypt to capture and annex Darfur into the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan The colonial government directed financial and administrative resources to the tribes of central Sudan near Khartoum, while the outlying regions such as Darfur remained mostly forgotten and ignored [35]\n\n\nWar in Darfur and the formation of the RSF\nBy the turn of the 21st century, Sudan's western Darfur region had endured prolonged instability and social strife due to racial and ethnic tensions and disputes over land and water In 2003, this situation erupted into a full-scale rebellion against government rule, against which president and military strongman Omar al-Bashir vowed to use forceful action The resulting War in Darfur was marked by widespread state-sponsored acts of violence, leading to charges of war crimes and genocide against al-Bashir [40] The initial phase of the conflict left approximately 300,000 dead and 2.7 million forcibly displaced; even though the intensity of the violence later declined, the situation in the region remained far from peaceful [41]\n\n\nPolitical transition\nIn December 2018, protests against al-Bashir's regime began, starting the first phase of the Sudanese Revolution Eight months of sustained civil disobedience were met with violent repression [49] In April 2019, the military (including the RSF) ousted al-Bashir in a coup d'état, ending his three decades of rule; the army established the Transitional Military Council, a junta [45] [46] [49] Bashir was imprisoned in Khartoum; he was not turned over to the ICC, which had issued warrants for his arrest on charges of war crimes [50] Protests calling for civilian rule continued; in June 2019, the TMC's security forces, which included both the RSF and the SAF, perpetrated the Khartoum massacre, in which more than a hundred demonstrators were killed [51] [43] [45] [49] and dozens were raped [43] Hemedti denied orchestrating the attack [45]\n\n\nOrigins of the SPLM-N and the SLM\nThe Sudan Liberation Movement (or Army; SLM, SLA, or SLM/A) is a rebel group active in Darfur, primarily composed of members of non-Arab ethnic groups [53] and established in response to their marginalization by the Bashir regime [54] [55] Since 2006, the movement has split into several factions due to disagreements over the Darfur Peace Agreement, with some factions joining the government in Khartoum [56] [57] [58] By 2023 the three most prominent factions were the SLM-Minnawi under Minni Minnawi, the SLM-al-Nur under Abdul Wahid al-Nur, and the SLM-Tambour under Mustafa Tambour The SLM-Minnawi and SLM-Tambour signed the 2020 Juba Peace Agreement, ceasing hostilities and receiving political appointments, but the SLM-al-Nur refused to sign and kept fighting [59] [60]\n\n\nPrelude\nIn the months after the 2021 coup the already weak Sudanese economy steeply declined, fueling wide protests demanding that the junta return power to civilian authorities [66] Tensions arose between al-Burhan and Hemedti over al-Burhan's restoration to the office of old-guard Islamist officials who had dominated the Omar al-Bashir government Hemedti saw the appointment of these officials as a signal that al-Burhan was attempting to maintain the dominance of Khartoum's traditional elite over Sudanese politics This was a danger to the RSF's political position, as said elites were hostile to Hemedti due to his ethnic background as a Darfuri Arab [67] Hemedti's expression of regret over the October 2021 coup signalled a widening divide between him and al-Burhan [52]\n\n\nCourse of the war\nOn 15 April 2023, the RSF attacked SAF bases across Sudan, including Khartoum and its airport [70] [75] There were clashes at the headquarters of the state broadcaster, Sudan TV, which was later captured by RSF forces [76] Bridges and roads in Khartoum and its hinterland were closed by RSF command [77] The next day saw a SAF counteroffensive, with the army retaking Merowe Airport alongside the headquarters of Sudan TV and the state radio [78] [79]\n\n\nApril–May 2023\nOn 15 April 2023, the RSF attacked SAF bases across Sudan, including Khartoum and its airport [70] [75] There were clashes at the headquarters of the state broadcaster, Sudan TV, which was later captured by RSF forces [76] Bridges and roads in Khartoum and its hinterland were closed by RSF command [77] The next day saw a SAF counteroffensive, with the army retaking Merowe Airport alongside the headquarters of Sudan TV and the state radio [78] [79]\n\n\nBattle of Khartoum\nOn 15 April 2023, the RSF attacked SAF bases across Sudan, including Khartoum and its airport [70] [75] There were clashes at the headquarters of the state broadcaster, Sudan TV, which was later captured by RSF forces [76] Bridges and roads in Khartoum and its hinterland were closed by RSF command [77] The next day saw a SAF counteroffensive, with the army retaking Merowe Airport alongside the headquarters of Sudan TV and the state radio [78] [79]\n\n\nTreaty of Jeddah\nInternational attention to the conflict resulted in the United Nations Human Rights Council calling a special session to address the violence, voting to increase monitoring of human rights abuses [100] On 6 May, delegates from the SAF and the RSF met directly for the first time in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for what was described by Saudi Arabia and the United States as \"pre-negotiation talks\" [101] After diplomatic lobbying from the Saudis and Americans the warring sides signed the Treaty of Jeddah on 20 May, vowing to ensure the safe passage of civilians, protect relief workers, and prohibit the use of civilians as human shields [102] The agreement did not include a ceasefire, and clashes resumed in Geneina, causing more casualties [102] The United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths expressed frustration at the lack of commitment from both sides to end the fighting [103]\n\n\nJune–September 2023\nAs June began, Khartoum witnessed tank battles resulting in casualties [110] [111] The RSF took control of several important cultural and government buildings, including the National Museum of Sudan and the Yarmouk Military Industrial Complex [112] [113] Acute food insecurity affected a significant portion of Sudan's population [114]\n\n\nContinued fighting in Khartoum\nAs June began, Khartoum witnessed tank battles resulting in casualties [110] [111] The RSF took control of several important cultural and government buildings, including the National Museum of Sudan and the Yarmouk Military Industrial Complex [112] [113] Acute food insecurity affected a significant portion of Sudan's population [114]\n\n\nDiplomatic efforts\nCeasefires between the warring parties were announced but often violated, leading to further clashes The SAF and RSF engaged in mutual blame for incidents, while the Sudanese government took action against international envoys [127] The Saudi embassy in Khartoum was attacked and evacuations from an orphanage were carried out amid the chaos [128] Amidst the turmoil, Sudan faced diplomatic strains with Egypt, leading to challenges for Sudanese refugees seeking entry [129] [130]\n\n\nSPLM-N (Al-Hilu) involvement\nThe Abdelaziz al-Hilu faction of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement–North (SPLM-N) broke a long-standing ceasefire agreement in June, attacking SAF units in Kadugli, Kurmuk and Dalang, the latter coinciding with an attack by the RSF The SAF claimed to have repelled the attacks, [27] [6] while the rebels claimed to have attacked in retaliation for the death of one of their soldiers at the hands of the SAF and vowed to free the region from \"military occupation\" [63] More than 35,000 were displaced by the fighting [63] Speculation arose as to whether the attacks were part of an unofficial alliance between al-Hilu and the RSF or an attempt by al-Hilu to strengthen his position in future negotiations concerning his group [135] Civil society organizations supporting the SPLM-N claimed its operations sought to protect civilians from possible attacks by the RSF [136]\n\n\nDarfur front\nIn Darfur, fighting and bloodshed were particularly fierce around the city of Geneina, where hundreds died and extensive destruction occurred [140] RSF forces engaged in frequent acts of violence against the Masalit population of Geneina, leading to accusations of ethnic cleansing [141] On 4 August the RSF claimed that it had taken full control over all of Central Darfur [142]\n\n\nOctober–December 2023\nBy October 2023, the SAF in Darfur was experiencing acute shortages in supplies due to RSF-imposed sieges and had failed to utilize its air superiority to stem RSF advances [153] On 26 October, the RSF captured Nyala, Sudan's fourth-largest city, after seizing control of the SAF's 16th Infantry Division headquarters [154] The fall of Nyala, a strategic city with an international airport and border connections to Central Africa, allowed the RSF to receive international supplies more easily and concentrate its forces on other Sudanese cities [155] After Nyala's fall, RSF fighters turned their focus to Zalingei, the capital of Central Darfur The SAF's 21st Infantry Division, stationed in Zalingei, fled the city without a fight and allowed the RSF to take it over [156]\n\n\nSAF collapse in Darfur\nBy October 2023, the SAF in Darfur was experiencing acute shortages in supplies due to RSF-imposed sieges and had failed to utilize its air superiority to stem RSF advances [153] On 26 October, the RSF captured Nyala, Sudan's fourth-largest city, after seizing control of the SAF's 16th Infantry Division headquarters [154] The fall of Nyala, a strategic city with an international airport and border connections to Central Africa, allowed the RSF to receive international supplies more easily and concentrate its forces on other Sudanese cities [155] After Nyala's fall, RSF fighters turned their focus to Zalingei, the capital of Central Darfur The SAF's 21st Infantry Division, stationed in Zalingei, fled the city without a fight and allowed the RSF to take it over [156]\n\n\nPeace negotiations stall\nAttempts by other nations and international organisations to negotiate peace had largely been dormant since the failure of the Treaty of Jeddah, but in late October the RSF and SAF met once more in Jeddah to attempt to negotiate peace [166] This new round of talks was a failure, with neither side willing to commit to a ceasefire Instead, the warring factions agreed to open channels for humanitarian aid [167] On 3 December negotiations were indefinitely suspended due to the failure of both the SAF and the RSF to open up aid channels [168]\n\n\nRSF Crossing of the Nile\nThe RSF attacked the town of Wad Ashana in North Kordofan on 1 October along a key commercial route [171] [172] In West Kordofan, an uptick in fighting was reported, with the RSF assaulting a \"vital\" oil field in Baleela, south of Al-Fulah [173] Geolocated footage showed RSF fighters celebrating around Baleela Airport after allegedly capturing it [174] The Battle of Khartoum continued with the RSF seizing the town of al-Aylafoun, southeast of the capital, on 6 October In the process, the paramilitary gained control of key oil infrastructure [175] [176] By late October the RSF controlled most of Khartoum but had failed to seize key military bases, while al-Burhan's government had largely relocated to Port Sudan [177]\n\n\nJanuary–April 2024\nFollowing the fall of Wad Madani efforts by IGAD to negotiate a ceasefire made progress, as the SAF's weakened position made them more eager to enter talks Whereas previously opposition from Islamist political groups to negotiation had prevented al-Burhan from committing to a specific date, now both he and Hemedti agreed to meet on 28 December [186] [191] A day before the meeting was due, it was cancelled as Hemedti recanted his desire to attend [192]\n\n\nHemedti travels abroad\nFollowing the fall of Wad Madani efforts by IGAD to negotiate a ceasefire made progress, as the SAF's weakened position made them more eager to enter talks Whereas previously opposition from Islamist political groups to negotiation had prevented al-Burhan from committing to a specific date, now both he and Hemedti agreed to meet on 28 December [186] [191] A day before the meeting was due, it was cancelled as Hemedti recanted his desire to attend [192]\n\n\nFighting in Kordofan and Gezira\nAs 2024 began the RSF made attacks into South Kordofan, defeating SAF forces in the town of Habila in the Nuba Mountains and pushing toward Dalang [197] On 7 January the RSF attacked SAF positions in Dalang, meeting fierce resistance from the army and civilian militias [190] [198] During the fighting the SPLM-N (al-Hilu) entered the city, taking control of several neighbourhoods SPLM-N forces proceeded to attack the RSF, and the paramilitary retreated from the city [199] RSF fighters withdrawing from Dalang entered the city of Muglad in West Kordofan, easily taking control as the city had no organised SAF presence West Kordofan had been relatively free of fighting for several months due to a local truce brokered by leaders of the Messiria tribe, but as tensions escalated rumours spread that the RSF was planning an attack on the encircled city of Babanusa and the SAF 22nd Infantry Division garrisoning it [199]\n\n\nSAF gains in Omdurman\nThe SAF gained ground in Omdurman in February 2024, linking up their forces in the northern part of the city and relieving a 10-month siege of their forces in the city centre The SAF also took control of the Al-Hilal Stadium [206] As of February 2024, the Omdurman front is the only area in Sudan where the SAF has carried out a sustained offensive operation and represents the first breakthrough for the SAF [206]\n\n\nApril 2024–present\nOn 15 April, during the Battle of El Fasher, at least nine civilians were killed in a renewed offensive by the RSF on the city of Al-Fashir in North Darfur [210] The Joint Darfur Force declared war on the RSF and allied with the SAF [211] [212]\n\n\nFighting in Darfur\nOn 15 April, during the Battle of El Fasher, at least nine civilians were killed in a renewed offensive by the RSF on the city of Al-Fashir in North Darfur [210] The Joint Darfur Force declared war on the RSF and allied with the SAF [211] [212]\n\n\nFighting in Kordofan\nAs of May 2024, fighting is ongoing in Babanusa, West Kordofan The RSF is conducting an offensive to attempt to take control of West Kordofan [219] Fighting was also reported in North Kordofan [220]\n\n\nFighting along the Nile\nIn May 2024, the RSF launched attacks against the SAF between Khartoum State and River Nile State, as well as in White Nile State near the border with Gezira State The SAF prepared its forces in River Nile State, ahead of a potential invasion of Khartoum Bahri [222] In June 2024, the RSF was still in control of Khartoum and Khartoum North, though the SAF controlled one enclave in each that it supplies by airdrop [223]\n\n\nSAF offensives\nAs September 2024 came, for the first time since the start of the war the balance of power seemed to be tipping towards the SAF On 26 September, the SAF launched a major offensive against RSF positions in Khartoum [232] The attack on the city came from three fronts striking from the south, east and west of the capital [233] SAF airstrikes, which killed four and wounded 14, began at dawn followed by clashes within the city The SAF reportedly captured three key bridges connecting Khartoum to other nearby cities, including the Omdurman Bridge which had previously acted as a line of separation between government and RSF control [234] [235] Faced with an elusive enemy, the SAF became bogged down in urban fighting - with RSF snipers routinely paralyzing infantry advances [233]\n\n\nCasualties\nAccording to a report published by Le Monde in November 2024, the war may have killed over 150,000 civilians through the combined tolls of bombardments, massacres, starvation and disease [233] A November 2024 report from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine estimated more than 61,000 deaths in Khartoum State alone, for the period between April 2023 and June 2024 [239]\n\n\nDarfur\nIn Geneina, West Darfur, ethnic clashes that began in the last week of April 2023 had killed at least 1,100 people, [245] while the Sultanate of Dar Masalit claimed that more than 5,000 people were killed and about 8,000 were wounded in the city [241] In July 2023, a Masalit tribal leader claimed that more than 10,000 people had been killed in West Darfur alone, and that 80% of Geneina's residents had fled [242]\n\n\nEastern Sudan\nIn July 2023, authorities reported at least 88 cases of sexual assault on women across the country, most of them blamed on the RSF [249] NGOs estimated that the figure could possibly reach 4,400 [250] Activist Hala al-Karib stated that war rape had become an everyday occurrence with both fighting parties participating [251] In 2024, Al Jazeera reported that Sudanese women were forced to exchange sex for food or become mistresses to RSF fighters to ensure their families’ safety and access to food [252]\n\n\nSexual violence\nIn July 2023, authorities reported at least 88

had become an everyday occurrence with both fighting parties participating [251] In 2024, Al Jazeera reported that Sudanese women were forced to exchange sex for food or become mistresses to RSF fighters to ensure their families’ safety and access to food [252]\n\n\nCasualties among humanitarian workers\nIn the Battle of Kabkabiya, three employees of the World Food Programme (WFP) were killed after being caught in the crossfire at a military base Two other staff members were injured [256] On 18 April 2023, the EU's top humanitarian aid officer in Sudan, Wim Fransen of Belgium, was shot and injured in Khartoum [257] On 21 April 2023, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported that one of its local employees was killed in a crossfire while traveling with his family near El-Obeid [258] On 20 July 2023, an 18-member team of Médecins Sans Frontières was attacked while transporting supplies to the Turkish Hospital in south Khartoum By then, the World Health Organization had verified 51 attacks on medical facilities and personnel since the conflict began, resulting in 10 deaths and 24 injuries [259] On 25 July 2023, Humanitarian Coordinator Clementine Nkweta-Salami said 18 aid workers had been killed and over two dozen others were detained or unaccounted for [260] The conflict has led the United Nations to declare Sudan the most dangerous country in the world for humanitarian workers after South Sudan [261]\n\n\nAttacks on journalists\nThe SAF and RSF are accused of threatening, attacking, and killing journalists during the conflict The Sudanese Journalists Syndicate documented over 40 violations in May alone Several journalists were injured or killed, and 13 newspapers ceased operations Humanitarian workers were also targeted, with 18 killed and many others detained.\n\n\nForeign casualties\nCivilians, including 15 Syrians, [281] 15 Ethiopians [280] and 9 Eritreans [283] have been killed across the country An Indian national working in

and had their possessions stolen on 13 June [284] Ten students from the Democratic Republic of the Congo were killed in an SAF airstrike on the International University of Africa in Khartoum on 4 June [282] The SAF claimed that the Egyptian assistant military attaché was killed by RSF fire while driving his car in Khartoum, which was refuted by the Egyptian ambassador [289]\n\n\nNotable deaths\nOn 16 April 2023, the RSF claimed that its troops in Port Sudan were attacked by foreign aircraft and issued a warning against any foreign interference [304] According to former CIA analyst Cameron Hudson, Egyptian fighter jets were a part of these bombing campaigns against the RSF, and Egyptian special forces units have been deployed and are providing intelligence and tactical support to the SAF [305] The Wall Street Journal said that Egypt had sent fighter jets and pilots to support the Sudanese military [306] On 17 April, satellite imagery obtained by The War Zone revealed that one Egyptian Air Force MiG-29M2 fighter jet had been destroyed and two others had been damaged or destroyed at Merowe Airbase A Sudanese Air Force Guizhou JL-9 was among the destroyed aircraft [307] After initial confusion, the RSF accepted the explanation that Egyptian combat and support personnel were conducting exercises with the Sudanese military before the outbreak of hostilities [70]\n\n\nForeign involvement\nOn 16 April 2023, the RSF claimed that its troops in Port Sudan were attacked by foreign aircraft and issued a warning against any foreign interference [304] According to former CIA

of hostilities [70]\n\n\nEgyptian POWs\nOn 15 April, RSF forces claimed, via Twitter, to have taken Egyptian troops prisoner near Merowe, [308] [309] and a military plane carrying markings of the Egyptian Air Force [310] Initially, no official explanation was given for the Egyptian soldiers' presence, while Egypt and Sudan have had military cooperation due to diplomatic tensions with Ethiopia [311] Later on, the Egyptian Armed Forces stated that around 200 of its soldiers were in Sudan to conduct exercises with the Sudanese military [70] Around that time, the SAF reportedly encircled RSF forces in Merowe airbase As a result, the Egyptian Armed Forces announced that it was following the situation as a precaution for the safety of its personnel [77] [312] [better source needed] The RSF later stated that it would cooperate in repatriating the soldiers to Egypt [310] On 19 April, the RSF stated that it had moved the soldiers to Khartoum and would hand them over when the \"appropriate opportunity\" arose [313] One hundred and seventy-seven of the captured Egyptian troops were released and flown back to Egypt aboard three Egyptian military planes that took off from Khartoum airport later in the day The remaining 27 soldiers, who were from the Egyptian Air Force, were sheltered at the Egyptian embassy and later evacuated [314] [315]\n\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\nA report published by the Wall Street Journal on 10 August 2023 quoted Ugandan officials as saying that an Emirati plane on a stopover at Entebbe Airport en route to Amdjarass International Airport in eastern Chad turned out upon inspection to have been carrying dozens of green plastic crates in the plane's cargo hold filled with ammunition, assault rifles and other small arms\", rather than food and other aid officially listed on the aircraft's manifest supposedly meant for Sudanese refugees Despite the discovery, the plane was allowed to take off, and the officials said they received orders from their superiors not to inspect any more planes from the UAE Before this, the UAE had long been accused of supporting the RSF The UAE Foreign Ministry subsequently denied the allegations, saying that the country \"does not take sides\" in the conflict [316]\n\n\nRussia\nFor much of the Sudanese civil war Russia has taken a generally neutral stance, not clearly backing either the RSF or SAF [345] This neutral attitude began to shift during mid-2024, with the Russian government beginning to favour the SAF, concurrent with the SAF emphasising its support for the construction of a Russian naval base north of Port Sudan [345] This move by the SAF was calculated to exploit tensions between Russia and western powers following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, offering the Russian government an opportunity to expand its international military influence in exchange for an international ally willing to both oppose the United Arab Emirates and provide significant weaponry [345] The SAF had at this stage of the conflict suffered several successive defeats at the hands of the RSF, making them more eager to make concessions to win international support [346]\n\n\nWagner Group\nAccording to CNN, Wagner supplied surface-to-air missiles to the RSF, picking up the items from Syria and delivering some of them by plane to Haftar-controlled bases in Libya to be then delivered to the RSF, while dropping other items directly to RSF positions in northwestern Sudan [347] American officials said that Wagner was offering to supply additional weapons to the RSF from its existing stocks in the Central African Republic [348] On 6 September, Wagner reportedly deployed a convoy of more than 100 vehicles carrying weapons to the RSF garrison in al-Zurug from Chad [349] SAF Lieutenant General Yasser al-Atta also accused the Wagner Group of bringing in mercenaries from several African nations to fight alongside the RSF [318]\n\n\nIran\nIn June 2024, a BBC investigation found evidence of the involvement of Iran and the UAE in violating the UN arms embargo by providing drones in the Sudanese conflict In March 2024, a piece of video evidence showed that Sudanese soldiers recaptured the state broadcaster's headquarters in Khartoum with the assistance of Iranian-made drones A drone expert, Wim Zwijnenburg also observed that an army drone shot down by the RSF in January 2024 resembled the Iranian-made Mohajer-6 drone Evidence also revealed the use of quadcopter drones by the RSF, which Brian Castner claimed belonged to the UAE The drones are capable of dropping 120mm motor shells, are had been supplied by the Emirates to its allies in the Yemen and Ethiopian wars [330]\n\n\nOther foreign actors\nOn 7 June 2023, Hissein Alamine Tchaw-tchaw, a Chadian dissident who belongs to the same ethnic group as Hemedti and claims to be the leader of the Movement for the Fight of the Oppressed in Chad (MFOC), which is fighting the government of President Mahamat Déby, posted a video showing his participation in an RSF attack on the Yarmouk munitions factory in Khartoum [360]\n\n\nChad\nOn 7 June 2023, Hissein Alamine Tchaw-tchaw, a Chadian dissident who belongs to the same ethnic group as Hemedti and claims to be the leader of the Movement for the Fight of the Oppressed in Chad (MFOC), which is fighting the government of President Mahamat Déby, posted a video showing his participation in an RSF attack on the Yarmouk munitions factory in Khartoum [360]\n\n\nKenya\nThe SAF rejected Kenya's involvement in mediation efforts to end the conflict in July after al-Burhan accused President William Ruto of having a business relationship with Hemedti and providing a haven to the RSF [366] [367] In response to proposals for a peacekeeping force composed by African countries to be deployed in Sudan made in an Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) committee chaired by Ruto, the SAF's Assistant Commander-in-Chief Lieutenant General Yasir Alatta accused Ruto of being a mercenary of another country, whom he did not identify, and dared Ruto to deploy the Kenyan army and that of his alleged backer [368] On 7 September, the Sudanese government threatened to withdraw the country's membership in IGAD unless Ruto was removed as chairman of the mediation committee [369]\n\n\nLibyan National Army\nThe Egypt-backed Libyan National Army, under the command of Khalifa Haftar, dispatched aircraft to fly military supplies to the RSF before the outbreak of hostilities [373] [306] Haftar and the LNA collaborated with the Wagner Group, a Russian private military company, to conduct these flights [373]\n\n\nUkraine\nOn 19 September 2023, CNN reported that it was \"likely\" that Ukrainian special forces were behind a series of drone strikes and a ground operation directed against the Wagner Group-backed RSF near Khartoum on 8 September [349] Kyrylo Budanov, the chief of the Ukrainian Main Directorate of Intelligence, stated in an interview on 22 September that he could neither confirm or deny Ukraine's involvement in the conflict, [375] but said that Ukraine \"will be seeking and hunting down Russian military criminals .. sooner or later\" [376]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nIn June 2024, The Guardian reported that according to multiple sources, UK government officials \"attempted to suppress criticism\" of the United Arab Emirates and its alleged role in supplying arms to the RSF [380] Furthermore, the UK is the UN Security Council's \"penholder\" [381] for Sudan [380] In early 2023, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office initiated secret talks between the RSF and the UK [382]\n\n\nEvacuation of foreign nationals\nThe outbreak of violence has led foreign governments to monitor the situation in Sudan and move toward the evacuation and repatriation of their nationals Among some countries with several expatriates in Sudan are Egypt, which has more than 10,000 citizens in the country, [383] and the United States, which has more than 16,000 citizens, most of whom are dual nationals [384] Efforts at extraction were hampered by the fighting within the capital Khartoum, particularly in and around the airport This has forced evacuations to be undertaken by road via Port Sudan on the Red Sea, which lies about 650 km (400 miles) northeast of Khartoum [385] from where they were airlifted or ferried directly to their home countries or third ones Other evacuations were undertaken through overland border crossings or airlifts from diplomatic missions and other designated locations with direct involvement of the militaries of some home countries Some transit hubs used during the evacuation include the port of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia and Djibouti, which hosts military bases of the United States, China, Japan, France, and other European countries [386]\n\n\nSanctions\nThe repeated violations of the ceasefire agreements and other atrocities during the conflict led to U.S President Joe Biden issuing an executive order on 4 May 2023 authorizing sanctions for those deemed responsible for destabilizing Sudan, undermining the democratic transition and committing human rights abuses [387] On 1 June, the US government imposed its first sanctions related to the conflict, targeting two firms associated with the SAF and two others linked to the RSF It also imposed visa restrictions against individuals involved in the violence but did not divulge any names [388]\n\n\nUnited States\nThe repeated violations of the ceasefire agreements and other atrocities during the conflict led to U.S President Joe

against individuals involved in the violence but did not divulge any names [388]\n\n\nOther countries\nOn 12 July 2023, the United Kingdom announced sanctions on firms linked to the SAF and the RSF for providing funds and weapons in the conflict [394] On 15 April 2024, Canada imposed sanctions on two individuals and four entities linked to the SAF and the RSF [395] On 23 June 2024, the European Union imposed sanctions on six entities for manufacturing and procuring weapons for the SAF and the RSF [396]\n\n\nHumanitarian impact\nThe humanitarian crisis following the fighting was further exacerbated by the violence occurring during a period of high temperatures, and drought starting during the fasting month of Ramadan Civilians were unable to venture outside of their homes to obtain food and supplies for fear of getting caught in the crossfire A doctors' group said that hospitals remained understaffed and were running low on supplies as wounded people streamed in [397] The World Health Organization (WHO) recorded around 26 attacks on healthcare facilities, some of which resulted in casualties among medical workers and civilians [398] The WHO said 80% of hospitals in conflict areas were out of service [399] with 32 forcibly evacuated by soldiers or caught in the crossfire [400] This included about half of Khartoum's 130 medical facilities and all hospitals in West Darfur [401] Outbreaks of diseases such as measles, cholera and diarrhea were reported across the country [402] In August 2024 cholera was declared an epidemic in the country and as of 8 September 2024 [update], there were 5,692 cases of cholera including 185 deaths [403]\n\n\nRefugees\nAs of July 2024, nearly 10 million residents of Sudan have been displaced due to the fighting The United Nations said that the conflict had produced more than 7.7 million internally displaced persons (IDPs), while more than 2.1 million had fled the country altogether as of June 2024 [21] [20] This made Sudan the largest host of IDPs globally [414] The International Organization for Migration estimated that around 36% of IDPs came from the Khartoum region [21] In November, the UN said the conflict created the largest child displacement crisis in the world, affecting three million children [415]\n\n\nEconomic impact\nThe UN estimated that economic activity in Sudan fell by more than a third during the first three weeks of the conflict [420] In July, Sudanese economists estimated the total amount of damage brought by the conflict at $9 billion, or an average of $100 million per day, while the value of property and goods looted was estimated at another $40 billion, with the most affected areas being Khartoum and South Darfur [421] The exchange rate of the US dollar against the Sudanese pound in the black market rose to SDG730 in September, while it reached SDG625 at the official rate This later reached SDG1250 in February 2024 The formal economy was described as being in a \"near standstill\" [422] [420] Gold production was also reduced to just 2 tons from the previous year's output of 18 tons [423] Sudanese minister for minerals Mohamed Bashir Abu Nammu accused the RSF of looting around 15 tons of silver and 1,273 kilograms of gold from the Sudan Gold Refinery at the start of the conflict [424]\n\n\nWar crimes investigations\nBoth the SAF and the RSF are accused of committing war crimes [427] The RSF in particular have been denounced by Human Rights Watch and numerous governments for committing crimes against humanity [428]\n\n\nDisinformation\nDuring the conflict, many instances of disinformation were observed, which aimed to manipulate public opinion, spread false narratives, and create confusion Both the SAF and the RSF engaged in disinformation campaigns on social media platforms [440] The RSF heavily relied on tweets and inauthentic behaviour to spread its agenda and influence local and international opinions The SAF used Twitter to refute RSF claims and boost army morale with false victory claims [440] The RSF had dedicated teams based in Khartoum and Dubai to engage in a digital propaganda war They used social media, including officially verified Facebook and Twitter accounts, to showcase their activities and spread disinformation [441]\n\n\nExamples\nOn 14 April, the official SAF social media page published a video which it said was of operations carried out by the Sudanese Air Force against the RSF Al Jazeera's monitoring and verification unit claimed the video had been fabricated using footage from the video game Arma 3 that was published on TikTok in March 2023 The unit claimed the video showing Sudanese army commander Abdel Fattah al-Burhan inspecting the Armoured Corps, in Al-Shajara, was from before the fighting A video reportedly of helicopters flying over Khartoum to participate in operations by the SAF against the RSF, which circulated on social media, turned out to be from November 2022 [444]\n\n\nResponses\nOn 11 August, Facebook shut down the main pages of the RSF due to a violation of its policy, \"Dangerous Organizations and Individuals\" In an alternate account, the RSF accused the SAF of lodging complaints based on false reports that led to the removal of its pages and said it was in contact with Facebook's parent company Meta Platforms to restore them [454]\n\n\nIn popular

April 2023, between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The conflict has resulted in significant human suffering, displacement, and economic loss.\n\n**Background**\n\nSudan has a long history of conflict, with various ethnic and regional groups vying for power and resources. The country has been plagued by civil wars, coups, and economic instability since gaining independence from British colonial rule in 1956. In 2003, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) rebel group emerged in the Darfur region, leading to a full-scale rebellion against the government. The conflict resulted in widespread human rights abuses, including genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.\n\n**Origins of the SPLM-N and the SLM**\n\nThe Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) was a rebel group that emerged in the late 1990s, primarily composed of members of non-Arab ethnic groups. The SPLM was established in response to the marginalization of these groups by the Bashir regime. Since 2006, the movement has split into several factions, with some joining the government in Khartoum. The most prominent factions are the SLM-Minnawi, the SLM-al-Nur, and the SLM-Tambour.\n\n**Prelude to the Conflict**\n\nIn the months leading up to the conflict, the Sudanese economy was in decline, fueling wide protests demanding that the junta return power to civilian authorities. Tensions arose between al-Burhan and Hemedti over al-Burhan's restoration to the office of old-guard Islamist officials who had dominated the Omar al-Bashir government.\n\n**Course of the War**\n\nOn 15 April 2023, the RSF attacked SAF bases across Sudan, including Khartoum and its airport. The next day saw a SAF counteroffensive, with the army retaking Merowe Airport alongside the headquarters of Sudan TV and the state radio. The RSF had captured several important cultural and government buildings, including the National Museum of Sudan and the Yarmouk Military Industrial Complex.\n\n**Treaty of Jeddah**\n\nInternational attention to the conflict resulted in the United Nations Human Rights Council calling a special session to address the violence, voting to increase monitoring of human rights abuses. On 6 May, delegates from the SAF and the RSF met directly for the first time in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for what was described by Saudi Arabia and the United States as \"pre-negotiation talks.\" After diplomatic lobbying from the Saudis and Americans, the warring sides signed the Treaty of Jeddah on 20 May, vowing to ensure the safe passage of civilians, protect relief workers, and prohibit the use of civilians as human shields.\n\n**June–September 2023**\n\nAs June began, Khartoum witnessed tank battles resulting in casualties. The RSF took control of several important cultural and government buildings, including the National Museum of Sudan and the Yarmouk Military Industrial Complex. Acute food insecurity affected a significant portion of Sudan's population.\n\n**Continued Fighting in Khartoum**\n\nAs June began, Khartoum witnessed tank battles resulting in casualties. The RSF took control of several important cultural and government buildings, including the National Museum of Sudan and the Yarmouk Military Industrial Complex. Acute food insecurity affected a significant portion of Sudan's population.\n\n**Diplomatic Efforts**\n\nCeasefires between the warring parties were announced but often violated, leading to further clashes. The SAF and RSF engaged in mutual blame for incidents, while the Sudanese government took action against international envoys. Humanitarian workers were also targeted, with 18 killed and many others detained.\n\n**RSF Advancements in Darfur**\n\nIn Darfur, fighting and bloodshed were particularly fierce around the city of Geneina, where hundreds died and extensive destruction occurred. RSF forces engaged in frequent acts of violence against the Masalit population of Geneina, leading to accusations of ethnic cleansing.\n\n**Foreign Casualties**\n\nCivilians, including 15 Syrians, 15 Ethiopians, and 9 Eritreans, have been killed across the country. An Indian national working in Khartoum died after being hit by a stray bullet on 15 April. Two Americans were killed, including a professor working in the University of Khartoum who was stabbed to death while evacuating.\n\n**Evacuation of Foreign Nationals**\n\nThe outbreak of violence has led foreign governments to monitor the situation in Sudan and move toward the evacuation and repatriation of their nationals.

outline:\n\n\nBackground\nSudan has been inhabited since prehistory and has seen many conflicts, with foreign invasions and resistance, ethnic tensions, religious disputes, and disputes over resources throughout antiquity and the middle ages [32] [33] Sudan was conquered by Egypt in 1821, and in 1881 the religious leader Muhammad Ahmad led a nationalist revolt and established an \"Islamic and national\" Mahdist State in much of the territory of modern Sudan [34] After Ahmad's death, a British-Egyptian force commanded by Lord Kitchener retook Sudan In 1899, the country became a condominium of Egypt and the United Kingdom, but was de facto ruled by the UK alone and would remain under British control until 1956, when it gained independence and inherited its pre-1911 borders In 1916, after the British government suspected that the Sultanate of Darfur was falling under the influence of the Ottoman government, an expedition was launched from Egypt to capture and annex Darfur into the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan The colonial government directed financial and administrative resources to the tribes of central Sudan near Khartoum, while the outlying regions such as Darfur remained mostly forgotten and ignored [35]\n\n\nWar in Darfur and the formation of the RSF\nBy the turn of the 21st century, Sudan's western Darfur region had endured prolonged instability and social strife due to racial and ethnic tensions and disputes over land and water In 2003, this situation erupted into a full-scale rebellion against government rule, against which president and military strongman Omar al-Bashir vowed to use forceful action The resulting War in Darfur was marked by widespread state-sponsored acts of violence, leading to charges of war crimes and genocide against al-Bashir [40] The initial phase of the conflict left approximately 300,000 dead and 2.7 million forcibly displaced; even though the intensity of the violence later declined, the situation in the region remained far from peaceful [41]\n\n\nPolitical transition\nIn December 2018, protests against al-Bashir's regime began, starting the first phase of the Sudanese Revolution Eight months of sustained civil disobedience were met with violent repression [49] In April 2019, the military (including the RSF) ousted al-Bashir in a coup d'état, ending his three decades of rule; the army established the Transitional Military Council, a junta [45] [46] [49] Bashir was imprisoned in Khartoum; he was not turned over to the ICC, which had issued warrants for his arrest on charges of war crimes [50] Protests calling for civilian rule continued; in June 2019, the TMC's security forces, which included both the RSF and the SAF, perpetrated the Khartoum massacre, in which more than a hundred demonstrators were killed [51] [43] [45] [49] and dozens were raped [43] Hemedti denied orchestrating the attack [45]\n\n\nOrigins of the SPLM-N and the SLM\nThe Sudan Liberation Movement (or Army; SLM, SLA, or SLM/A) is a rebel group active in Darfur, primarily composed of members of non-Arab ethnic groups [53] and established in response to their marginalization by the Bashir regime [54] [55] Since 2006, the movement has split into several factions due to disagreements over the Darfur Peace Agreement, with some factions joining the government in Khartoum [56] [57] [58] By 2023 the three most prominent factions were the SLM-Minnawi under Minni Minnawi, the SLM-al-Nur under Abdul Wahid al-Nur, and the SLM-Tambour under Mustafa Tambour The SLM-Minnawi and SLM-Tambour signed the 2020 Juba Peace Agreement, ceasing hostilities and receiving political appointments, but the SLM-al-Nur refused to sign and kept fighting [59] [60]\n\n\nPrelude\nIn the months after the 2021 coup the already weak Sudanese economy steeply declined, fueling wide protests demanding that the junta return power to civilian authorities [66] Tensions arose between al-Burhan and Hemedti over al-Burhan's restoration to the office of old-guard Islamist officials who had dominated the Omar al-Bashir government Hemedti saw the appointment of these officials as a signal that al-Burhan was attempting to maintain the dominance of Khartoum's traditional elite over Sudanese politics This was a danger to the RSF's political position, as said elites were hostile to Hemedti due to his ethnic background as a Darfuri Arab [67] Hemedti's expression of regret over the October 2021 coup signalled a widening divide between him and al-Burhan [52]\n\n\nCourse of the war\nOn 15 April 2023, the RSF attacked SAF bases across Sudan, including Khartoum and its airport [70] [75] There were clashes at the headquarters of the state broadcaster, Sudan TV, which was later captured by RSF forces [76] Bridges and roads in Khartoum and its hinterland were closed by RSF command [77] The next day saw a SAF counteroffensive, with the army retaking Merowe Airport alongside the headquarters of Sudan TV and the state radio [78] [79]\n\n\nApril–May 2023\nOn 15 April 2023, the RSF attacked SAF bases across Sudan, including Khartoum and its airport [70] [75] There were clashes at the headquarters of the state broadcaster, Sudan TV, which was later captured by RSF forces [76] Bridges and roads in Khartoum and its hinterland were closed by RSF command [77] The next day saw a SAF counteroffensive, with the army retaking Merowe Airport alongside the headquarters of Sudan TV and the state radio [78] [79]\n\n\nBattle of Khartoum\nOn 15 April 2023, the RSF attacked SAF bases across Sudan, including Khartoum and its airport [70] [75] There were clashes at the headquarters of the state broadcaster, Sudan TV, which was later captured by RSF forces [76] Bridges and roads in Khartoum and its hinterland were closed by RSF command [77] The next day saw a SAF counteroffensive, with the army retaking Merowe Airport alongside the headquarters of Sudan TV and the state radio [78] [79]\n\n\nTreaty of Jeddah\nInternational attention to the conflict resulted in the United Nations Human Rights Council calling a special session to address the violence, voting to increase monitoring of human rights abuses [100] On 6 May, delegates from the SAF and the RSF met directly for the first time in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for what was described by Saudi Arabia and the United States as \"pre-negotiation talks\" [101] After diplomatic lobbying from the Saudis and Americans the warring sides signed the Treaty of Jeddah on 20 May, vowing to ensure the safe passage of civilians, protect relief workers, and prohibit the use of civilians as human shields [102] The agreement did not include a ceasefire, and clashes resumed in Geneina, causing more casualties [102] The United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths expressed frustration at the lack of commitment from both sides to end the fighting [103]\n\n\nJune–September 2023\nAs June began, Khartoum witnessed tank battles resulting in casualties [110] [111] The RSF took control of several important cultural and government buildings, including the National Museum of Sudan and the Yarmouk Military Industrial Complex [112] [113] Acute food insecurity affected a significant portion of Sudan's population [114]\n\n\nContinued fighting in Khartoum\nAs June began, Khartoum witnessed tank battles resulting in casualties [110] [111] The RSF took control of several important cultural and government buildings, including the National Museum of Sudan and the Yarmouk Military Industrial Complex [112] [113] Acute food insecurity affected a significant portion of Sudan's population [114]\n\n\nDiplomatic efforts\nCeasefires between the warring parties were announced but often violated, leading to further clashes The SAF and RSF engaged in mutual blame for incidents, while the Sudanese government took action against international envoys [127] The Saudi embassy in Khartoum was attacked and evacuations from an orphanage were carried out amid the chaos [128] Amidst the turmoil, Sudan faced diplomatic strains with Egypt, leading to challenges for Sudanese refugees seeking entry [129] [130]\n\n\nSPLM-N (Al-Hilu) involvement\nThe Abdelaziz al-Hilu faction of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement–North (SPLM-N) broke a long-standing ceasefire agreement in June, attacking SAF units in Kadugli, Kurmuk and Dalang, the latter coinciding with an attack by the RSF The SAF claimed to have repelled the attacks, [27] [6] while the rebels claimed to have attacked in retaliation for the death of one of their soldiers at the hands of the SAF and vowed to free the region from \"military occupation\" [63] More than 35,000 were displaced by the fighting [63] Speculation arose as to whether the attacks were part of an unofficial alliance between al-Hilu and the RSF or an attempt by al-Hilu to strengthen his position in future negotiations concerning his group [135] Civil society organizations supporting the SPLM-N claimed its operations sought to protect civilians from possible attacks by the RSF [136]\n\n\nDarfur front\nIn Darfur, fighting and bloodshed were particularly fierce around the city of Geneina, where hundreds died and extensive destruction occurred [140] RSF forces engaged in frequent acts of violence against the Masalit population of Geneina, leading to accusations of ethnic cleansing [141] On 4 August the RSF claimed that it had taken full control over all of Central Darfur [142]\n\n\nOctober–December 2023\nBy October 2023, the SAF in Darfur was experiencing acute shortages in supplies due to RSF-imposed sieges and had failed to utilize its air superiority to stem RSF advances [153] On 26 October, the RSF captured Nyala, Sudan's fourth-largest city, after seizing control of the SAF's 16th Infantry Division headquarters [154] The fall of Nyala, a strategic city with an international airport and border connections to Central Africa, allowed the RSF to receive international supplies more easily and concentrate its forces on other Sudanese cities [155] After Nyala's fall, RSF fighters turned their focus to Zalingei, the capital of Central Darfur The SAF's 21st Infantry Division, stationed in Zalingei, fled the city without a fight and allowed the RSF to take it over [156]\n\n\nSAF collapse in Darfur\nBy October 2023, the SAF in Darfur was experiencing acute shortages in supplies due to RSF-imposed sieges and had failed to utilize its air superiority to stem RSF advances [153] On 26 October, the RSF captured Nyala, Sudan's fourth-largest city, after seizing control of the SAF's 16th Infantry Division headquarters [154] The fall of Nyala, a strategic city with an international airport and border connections to Central Africa, allowed the RSF to receive international supplies more easily and concentrate its forces on other Sudanese cities [155] After Nyala's fall, RSF fighters turned their focus to Zalingei, the capital of Central Darfur The SAF's 21st Infantry Division, stationed in Zalingei, fled the city without a fight and allowed the RSF to take it over [156]\n\n\nPeace negotiations stall\nAttempts by other nations and international organisations to negotiate peace had largely been dormant since the failure of the Treaty of Jeddah, but in late October the RSF and SAF met once more in Jeddah to attempt to negotiate peace [166] This new round of talks was a failure, with neither side willing to commit to a ceasefire Instead, the warring factions agreed to open channels for humanitarian aid [167] On 3 December negotiations were indefinitely suspended due to the failure of both the SAF and the RSF to open up aid channels [168]\n\n\nRSF Crossing of the Nile\nThe RSF attacked the town of Wad Ashana in North Kordofan on 1 October along a key commercial route [171] [172] In West Kordofan, an uptick in fighting was reported, with the RSF assaulting a \"vital\" oil field in Baleela, south of Al-Fulah [173] Geolocated footage showed RSF fighters celebrating around Baleela Airport after allegedly capturing it [174] The Battle of Khartoum continued with the RSF seizing the town of al-Aylafoun, southeast of the capital, on 6 October In the process, the paramilitary gained control of key oil infrastructure [175] [176] By late October the RSF controlled most of Khartoum but had failed to seize key military bases, while al-Burhan's government had largely relocated to Port Sudan [177]\n\n\nJanuary–April 2024\nFollowing the fall of Wad Madani efforts by IGAD to negotiate a ceasefire made progress, as the SAF's weakened position made them more eager to enter talks Whereas previously opposition from Islamist political groups to negotiation had prevented al-Burhan from committing to a specific date, now both he and Hemedti agreed to meet on 28 December [186] [191] A day before the meeting was due, it was cancelled as Hemedti recanted his desire to attend [192]\n\n\nHemedti travels abroad\nFollowing the fall of Wad Madani efforts by IGAD to negotiate a ceasefire made progress, as the SAF's weakened position made them more eager to enter talks Whereas previously opposition from Islamist political groups to negotiation had prevented al-Burhan from committing to a specific date, now both he and Hemedti agreed to meet on 28 December [186] [191] A day before the meeting was due, it was cancelled as Hemedti recanted his desire to attend [192]\n\n\nFighting in Kordofan and Gezira\nAs 2024 began the RSF made attacks into South Kordofan, defeating SAF forces in the town of Habila in the Nuba Mountains and pushing toward Dalang [197] On 7 January the RSF attacked SAF positions in Dalang, meeting fierce resistance from the army and civilian militias [190] [198] During the fighting the SPLM-N (al-Hilu) entered the city, taking control of several neighbourhoods SPLM-N forces proceeded to attack the RSF, and the paramilitary retreated from the city [199] RSF fighters withdrawing from Dalang entered the city of Muglad in West Kordofan, easily taking control as the city had no organised SAF presence West Kordofan had been relatively free of fighting for several months due to a local truce brokered by leaders of the Messiria tribe, but as tensions escalated rumours spread that the RSF was planning an attack on the encircled city of Babanusa and the SAF 22nd Infantry Division garrisoning it [199]\n\n\nSAF gains in Omdurman\nThe SAF gained ground in Omdurman in February 2024, linking up their forces in the northern part of the city and relieving a 10-month siege of their forces in the city centre The SAF also took control of the Al-Hilal Stadium [206] As of February 2024, the Omdurman front is the only area in Sudan where the SAF has carried out a sustained offensive operation and represents the first breakthrough for the SAF [206]\n\n\nApril 2024–present\nOn 15 April, during the Battle of El Fasher, at least nine civilians were killed in a renewed offensive by the RSF on the city of Al-Fashir in North Darfur [210] The Joint Darfur Force declared war on the RSF and allied with the SAF [211] [212]\n\n\nFighting

take control of West Kordofan [219] Fighting was also reported in North Kordofan [220]\n\n\nFighting along the Nile\nIn May 2024, the RSF launched attacks against the SAF between Khartoum State and River Nile State, as well as in White Nile State near the border with Gezira State The SAF prepared its forces in River Nile State, ahead of a potential invasion of Khartoum Bahri [222] In June 2024, the RSF was still in control of Khartoum and Khartoum North, though the SAF controlled one enclave in each that it supplies by airdrop [223]\n\n\nSAF offensives\nAs September 2024 came, for the first time since the start of the war the balance of power seemed to be tipping towards the SAF On 26 September, the SAF launched a major offensive against RSF positions in Khartoum [232] The attack on the city came from three fronts striking from the south, east and west of the capital [233] SAF airstrikes, which killed four and wounded 14, began at dawn followed by clashes within the city The SAF reportedly captured three key bridges connecting Khartoum to other nearby cities, including the Omdurman Bridge which had previously acted as a line of separation between government and RSF control [234] [235] Faced with an elusive enemy, the SAF became bogged down in urban fighting - with RSF snipers routinely paralyzing infantry advances [233]\n\n\nCasualties\nAccording to a report published by Le Monde in November 2024, the war may have killed over 150,000 civilians through the combined tolls of bombardments, massacres, starvation and disease [233] A November 2024 report from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine estimated more than 61,000 deaths in Khartoum State alone, for the period between April 2023 and June 2024 [239]\n\n\nDarfur\nIn Geneina, West Darfur, ethnic clashes that began in the last week of April 2023 had killed at least 1,100 people, [245] while the Sultanate of Dar Masalit claimed that more than 5,000 people were killed and about 8,000 were wounded in the city [241] In July 2023, a Masalit tribal leader claimed that more than 10,000 people had been killed in West Darfur alone, and that 80% of Geneina's residents had fled [242]\n\n\nEastern Sudan\nIn July 2023, authorities reported at least 88 cases of sexual assault on women across the country, most of them blamed on the RSF [249] NGOs estimated that the figure could possibly reach 4,400 [250] Activist Hala al-Karib stated that war rape had become an everyday occurrence with both fighting parties participating [251] In 2024, Al Jazeera reported that Sudanese women were forced to exchange sex for food or become mistresses to RSF fighters to ensure their families’ safety and access to food [252]\n\n\nSexual violence\nIn July 2023, authorities reported at least 88 cases of sexual assault on women across the country, most of them blamed on the RSF [249] NGOs estimated that the figure could possibly reach 4,400 [250] Activist Hala al-Karib stated that war rape had become an everyday occurrence with both fighting parties participating [251] In 2024, Al Jazeera reported that Sudanese women were forced to exchange sex for food or become mistresses to RSF fighters to ensure their families’ safety and access to food [252]\n\n\nCasualties among humanitarian workers\nIn the Battle of Kabkabiya, three employees of the World Food Programme (WFP) were killed

injured in Khartoum [257] On 21 April 2023, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported that one of its local employees was killed in a crossfire while traveling with his family near El-Obeid [258] On 20 July 2023, an 18-member team of Médecins Sans Frontières was attacked while transporting supplies to the Turkish Hospital in south Khartoum By then, the World Health Organization had verified 51 attacks on medical facilities and personnel since the conflict began, resulting in 10 deaths and 24 injuries [259] On 25 July 2023, Humanitarian Coordinator Clementine Nkweta-Salami said 18 aid workers had been killed and over two dozen others were detained or unaccounted for [260] The conflict has led the United Nations to declare Sudan the most dangerous country in the world for humanitarian workers after South Sudan [261]\n\n\nAttacks on journalists\nThe SAF and RSF are accused of threatening, attacking, and killing journalists during the conflict The Sudanese Journalists Syndicate documented over 40 violations in May alone Several journalists were injured or killed, and 13 newspapers ceased operations Humanitarian workers were also targeted, with 18 killed and many others detained.\n\n\nForeign casualties\nCivilians, including 15 Syrians, [281] 15 Ethiopians [280] and 9 Eritreans [283] have been killed across the country An Indian national working in

16 April 2023, the RSF claimed that its troops in Port Sudan were attacked by foreign aircraft and issued a warning against any foreign interference [304] According to former CIA analyst Cameron Hudson, Egyptian fighter jets were a part of these bombing campaigns against the RSF, and Egyptian special forces units have been deployed and are providing intelligence and tactical support to the SAF [305] The Wall Street Journal said that Egypt had sent fighter jets and pilots to support the Sudanese military [306] On 17 April, satellite imagery obtained by The War Zone revealed that one Egyptian Air Force MiG-29M2 fighter jet had been destroyed and two others had been damaged or destroyed at Merowe Airbase A Sudanese Air Force Guizhou JL-9 was among the destroyed aircraft [307] After initial confusion, the RSF accepted the explanation that Egyptian combat and support personnel were conducting exercises with the Sudanese military before the outbreak of hostilities [70]\n\n\nForeign involvement\nOn 16 April 2023, the RSF claimed that its troops in Port Sudan were attacked by foreign aircraft and issued a warning against any foreign interference [304] According to former CIA analyst Cameron Hudson, Egyptian fighter jets were a part of these bombing campaigns against the RSF, and Egyptian special forces units have been deployed and are providing intelligence and tactical

aircraft [307] After initial confusion, the RSF accepted the explanation that Egyptian combat and support personnel were conducting exercises with the Sudanese military before the outbreak of hostilities [70]\n\n\nEgypt\nOn 16 April 2023, the RSF claimed that its troops in Port Sudan were attacked by foreign aircraft and issued a warning against any foreign interference [304] According to

destroyed aircraft [307] After initial confusion, the RSF accepted the explanation that Egyptian combat and support personnel were conducting exercises with the Sudanese military before the outbreak of hostilities [70]\n\n\nEgyptian POWs\nOn 15 April, RSF forces claimed, via Twitter, to have taken Egyptian troops prisoner near Merowe, [308] [309] and a military plane carrying markings of the Egyptian Air Force [310] Initially, no official explanation was given for the Egyptian soldiers' presence, while Egypt and Sudan have had military cooperation due to diplomatic tensions with Ethiopia [311] Later on, the Egyptian Armed Forces stated that around 200 of its soldiers were in Sudan to conduct exercises with the Sudanese military [70] Around that time, the SAF reportedly encircled RSF forces in Merowe airbase As a result, the Egyptian Armed Forces announced that it was following the situation as a precaution for the safety of its personnel [77] [312] [better source needed] The RSF later stated that it would cooperate in repatriating the soldiers to Egypt [310] On 19 April, the RSF stated that it had moved the soldiers to Khartoum and would hand them over when the \"appropriate opportunity\" arose [313] One hundred and seventy-seven of the captured Egyptian troops were released and flown back to Egypt aboard three Egyptian military planes that took off from Khartoum airport later in the day The remaining 27 soldiers, who were from the Egyptian Air Force, were sheltered at the Egyptian embassy and later evacuated [314] [315]\n\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\nA report published by the Wall Street Journal on 10 August 2023 quoted Ugandan officials as saying that an Emirati plane on a stopover at Entebbe Airport en route to Amdjarass International Airport in eastern Chad turned out upon inspection to have been carrying dozens of green plastic crates in the plane's cargo hold filled with ammunition, assault rifles and other small arms\", rather than food and other aid officially listed on the aircraft's manifest supposedly meant for Sudanese refugees Despite the discovery, the plane was allowed to take off, and the officials said they received orders from their superiors not to inspect any more planes from the UAE Before this, the UAE had long been accused of supporting the RSF The UAE Foreign Ministry subsequently denied the allegations, saying that the country \"does not take sides\" in the conflict [316]\n\n\nRussia\nFor much of the Sudanese civil war Russia has taken a generally neutral stance, not clearly backing either the RSF or SAF [345] This neutral attitude began to shift during mid-2024, with the Russian government beginning to favour the SAF, concurrent with the SAF emphasising its support for the construction of a Russian naval base north of Port Sudan [345] This move by the SAF was calculated to exploit tensions between Russia and western powers following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, offering the Russian government an opportunity to expand its international military influence in exchange for an international ally willing to both oppose the United Arab Emirates and provide significant weaponry [345] The SAF had at this stage of the conflict suffered several successive defeats at the hands of the RSF, making them more eager to make concessions to win international support [346]\n\n\nWagner Group\nAccording to CNN, Wagner supplied surface-to-air missiles to the RSF, picking up the items from Syria and delivering some of them by plane to Haftar-controlled bases in Libya to be then delivered to the RSF, while dropping other items directly to RSF positions in northwestern Sudan [347] American officials said that Wagner was offering to supply additional weapons to the RSF from its existing stocks in the Central African Republic [348] On 6 September, Wagner reportedly deployed a convoy of more than 100 vehicles carrying weapons to the RSF garrison in al-Zurug from Chad [349] SAF Lieutenant General Yasser al-Atta also accused the Wagner Group of bringing in mercenaries from several African nations to fight alongside the RSF [318]\n\n\nIran\nIn June 2024, a BBC investigation found evidence of the involvement of Iran and the UAE in violating the UN arms embargo by providing drones in the Sudanese conflict In March 2024, a piece of video evidence showed that Sudanese soldiers recaptured the state broadcaster's headquarters in Khartoum with the assistance of Iranian-made drones A drone expert, Wim Zwijnenburg also observed that an army drone shot down by the RSF in January 2024 resembled the Iranian-made Mohajer-6 drone Evidence also revealed the use of quadcopter drones by the RSF, which Brian Castner claimed belonged to the UAE The drones are capable of dropping 120mm motor shells, are had been supplied by the Emirates to its allies in the Yemen and Ethiopian wars [330]\n\n\nOther foreign actors\nOn 7 June 2023, Hissein Alamine Tchaw-tchaw, a Chadian dissident who belongs to the same ethnic group as Hemedti and claims to be the leader of the Movement for the Fight of the Oppressed in Chad (MFOC), which is fighting the government of President Mahamat Déby, posted a video showing his participation in an RSF attack on the Yarmouk munitions factory in Khartoum [360]\n\n\nChad\nOn 7 June 2023, Hissein Alamine Tchaw-tchaw, a Chadian dissident who belongs to the same ethnic group as Hemedti and claims to be the leader of the Movement for the Fight of the Oppressed in Chad (MFOC), which is fighting the government of President Mahamat Déby, posted a video showing his participation in an RSF attack on the Yarmouk munitions factory in Khartoum [360]\n\n\nKenya\nThe SAF rejected Kenya's involvement in mediation efforts to end the conflict in July after al-Burhan accused President William Ruto of having a business relationship with Hemedti and providing a haven to the RSF [366] [367] In response to proposals for a peacekeeping force composed by African countries to be deployed in Sudan made in an Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) committee chaired by Ruto, the SAF's Assistant Commander-in-Chief Lieutenant General Yasir Alatta accused Ruto of being a mercenary of another country, whom he did not identify, and dared Ruto to deploy the Kenyan army and that of his alleged backer [368] On 7 September, the Sudanese government threatened to withdraw the country's membership in IGAD unless Ruto was removed as chairman of the mediation committee [369]\n\n\nLibyan National Army\nThe Egypt-backed Libyan National Army, under the command of Khalifa Haftar, dispatched aircraft to fly military supplies to the RSF before the outbreak of hostilities [373] [306] Haftar and the LNA collaborated with the Wagner Group, a Russian private military company, to conduct these flights [373]\n\n\nUkraine\nOn 19 September 2023, CNN reported that it was \"likely\" that Ukrainian special forces were behind a series of drone strikes and a ground operation directed against the Wagner Group-backed RSF near Khartoum on 8 September [349] Kyrylo Budanov, the chief of the Ukrainian Main Directorate of Intelligence, stated in an interview on 22 September that he could neither confirm or deny Ukraine's involvement in the conflict, [375] but said that Ukraine \"will be seeking and hunting down Russian military criminals .. sooner or later\" [376]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nIn June 2024, The Guardian reported that according to multiple sources, UK government officials \"attempted to suppress criticism\" of the United Arab Emirates and its alleged role in supplying arms to the RSF [380] Furthermore, the UK is the UN Security Council's \"penholder\" [381] for Sudan [380] In early 2023, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office initiated secret talks between the RSF and the UK [382]\n\n\nEvacuation of foreign nationals\nThe outbreak of violence has led foreign governments to monitor the situation in Sudan and move toward the evacuation and repatriation of their nationals Among some countries with several expatriates in Sudan are Egypt, which has more than 10,000 citizens in the country, [383] and the United States, which has more than 16,000 citizens, most of whom are dual nationals [384] Efforts at extraction were hampered by the fighting within the capital Khartoum, particularly in and around the airport This has forced evacuations to be undertaken by road via Port Sudan on the Red Sea, which lies about 650 km (400 miles) northeast of Khartoum [385] from where they were airlifted or ferried directly to their home countries or third ones Other evacuations were undertaken through overland border crossings or airlifts from diplomatic missions and other designated locations with direct involvement of the militaries of some home countries Some transit hubs used during the evacuation include the port of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia and Djibouti, which hosts military bases of the United States, China, Japan, France, and other European countries [386]\n\n\nSanctions\nThe repeated violations of the ceasefire agreements and other atrocities during the conflict led to U.S President Joe Biden issuing an executive order on 4 May 2023 authorizing sanctions for those deemed responsible for destabilizing Sudan, undermining the democratic transition and committing human rights abuses [387] On 1 June, the US government imposed its first sanctions related to the conflict, targeting two firms associated with the SAF and two others linked to the RSF It also imposed visa restrictions against individuals involved in the violence but did not divulge any names [388]\n\n\nUnited States\nThe repeated violations of the ceasefire agreements and other atrocities during the conflict led to U.S President Joe

against individuals involved in the violence but did not divulge any names [388]\n\n\nOther countries\nOn 12 July 2023, the United Kingdom announced sanctions on firms linked to the SAF and the RSF for providing funds and weapons in the conflict [394] On 15 April 2024, Canada imposed sanctions on two individuals and four entities linked to the SAF and the RSF [395] On 23 June 2024, the European Union imposed sanctions on six entities for manufacturing and procuring weapons for the SAF and the RSF [396]\n\n\nHumanitarian impact\nThe humanitarian crisis following the fighting was further exacerbated by the violence occurring during a period of high temperatures, and drought starting during the fasting month of Ramadan Civilians were unable to venture outside of their homes to obtain food and supplies for fear of getting caught in the crossfire A doctors' group said that hospitals remained understaffed and were running low on supplies as wounded people streamed in [397] The World Health Organization (WHO) recorded around 26 attacks on healthcare facilities, some of which resulted in casualties among medical workers and civilians [398] The WHO said 80% of hospitals in conflict areas were out of service [399] with 32 forcibly evacuated by soldiers or caught in the crossfire [400] This included about half of Khartoum's 130 medical facilities and all hospitals in West Darfur [401] Outbreaks of diseases such as measles, cholera and diarrhea were reported across the country [402] In August 2024 cholera was declared an epidemic in the country and as of 8 September 2024 [update], there were 5,692 cases of cholera including 185 deaths [403]\n\n\nRefugees\nAs of July 2024, nearly 10 million residents of Sudan have been displaced due to the fighting The United Nations said that the conflict had produced more than 7.7 million internally displaced persons (IDPs), while more than 2.1 million had fled the country altogether as of June 2024 [21] [20] This made Sudan the largest host of IDPs globally [414] The International Organization for Migration estimated that around 36% of IDPs came from the Khartoum region [21] In November, the UN said the conflict created the largest child displacement crisis in the world, affecting three million children [415]\n\n\nEconomic impact\nThe UN estimated that economic activity in Sudan fell by more than a third during the first three weeks of the conflict [420] In July, Sudanese economists estimated the total amount of damage brought by the conflict at $9 billion, or an average of $100 million per day, while the value of property and goods looted was estimated at another $40 billion, with the most affected areas being Khartoum and South Darfur [421] The exchange rate of the US dollar against the Sudanese pound in the black market rose to SDG730 in September, while it reached SDG625 at the official rate This later reached SDG1250 in February 2024 The formal economy was described as being in a \"near standstill\" [422] [420] Gold production was also reduced to just 2 tons from the previous year's output of 18 tons [423] Sudanese minister for minerals Mohamed Bashir Abu Nammu accused the RSF of looting around 15 tons of silver and 1,273 kilograms of gold from the Sudan Gold Refinery at the start of the conflict [424]\n\n\nWar crimes investigations\nBoth the SAF and the RSF are accused of committing war crimes [427] The RSF in particular have been denounced by Human Rights Watch and numerous governments for committing crimes against humanity [428]\n\n\nDisinformation\nDuring the conflict, many instances of disinformation were observed, which aimed to manipulate public opinion, spread false narratives, and create confusion Both the SAF and the RSF engaged in disinformation campaigns on social media platforms [440] The RSF heavily relied on tweets and inauthentic behaviour to spread its agenda and influence local and international opinions The SAF used Twitter to refute RSF claims and boost army morale with false victory claims [440] The RSF had dedicated teams based in Khartoum and Dubai to engage in a digital propaganda war They used social media, including officially verified Facebook and Twitter accounts, to showcase their activities and spread disinformation [441]\n\n\nExamples\nOn 14 April, the official SAF social media page published a video which it said was of operations carried out by the Sudanese Air Force against the RSF Al Jazeera's monitoring and verification unit claimed the video had been fabricated using footage from the video game Arma 3 that was published on TikTok in March 2023 The unit claimed the video showing Sudanese army commander Abdel Fattah al-Burhan inspecting the Armoured Corps, in Al-Shajara, was from before the fighting A video reportedly of helicopters flying over Khartoum to participate in operations by the SAF against the RSF, which circulated on social media, turned out to be from November 2022 [444]\n\n\nResponses\nOn 11 August, Facebook shut down the main pages of the RSF due to a violation of its policy, \"Dangerous Organizations and Individuals\" In an alternate account, the RSF accused the SAF of lodging complaints based on false reports that led to the removal of its pages and said it was in contact with Facebook's parent company Meta Platforms to restore them [454]\n\n\nIn popular

Confederados who emigrated from the United States to the Brazilian Empire after the American Civil War [7]\n\n\nPolitics\nAfter helping her husband win the governorship of Georgia in 1970, Rosalynn decided to focus her attention mainly in the field of mental health when she was that state's first lady [23] She was appointed to the Governor's Commission to Improve Services for the Mentally and Emotionally Handicapped Many of the commission's recommendations were approved and became law In August 1971, Carter engaged in a statewide tour of mental health facilities across Georgia [24] She described her efforts on behalf of mentally disabled children as her proudest achievement as First Lady of Georgia [25]\n\n\nFirst Lady of Georgia (1971–1975)\nAfter helping her husband win the governorship of Georgia in 1970, Rosalynn decided to focus her attention mainly in the field of mental health when she was that state's first lady [23] She was appointed to the Governor's Commission to Improve Services for the Mentally and Emotionally Handicapped Many of the commission's recommendations were approved and became law In August 1971, Carter engaged in a statewide tour of mental health facilities across Georgia [24] She described her efforts on behalf of mentally disabled children as her proudest achievement as First Lady of Georgia [25]\n\n\n1976 presidential campaign\nWhen her husband's gubernatorial term ended in January 1975, Rosalynn, Jimmy, and Amy Carter returned to Plains Jimmy had already announced his plans to run for president of the United States Rosalynn got back on the campaign trail, this time on a national quest to gather support for her husband She campaigned alone on his behalf in 41 states Because of her husband's obscurity at the time, she often had to answer the question, \"Jimmy who?\" [23] She promoted the establishment of additional daycare facilities and adjustments to \"Social Security and so many other things to help the elderly.\" [29]\n\n\nFirst Lady of the United States (1977–1981)\nWhen her husband assumed the presidency in January 1977, Rosalynn and Jimmy Carter walked hand-in-hand down Pennsylvania Avenue during his presidential inauguration parade The gown that she wore to the inaugural balls was the same one that she had worn six years earlier at the Atlanta balls when Jimmy became governor [35]\n\n\nMajor initiatives\nWhen her husband assumed the presidency in January 1977, Rosalynn and Jimmy Carter walked hand-in-hand down Pennsylvania Avenue during his presidential inauguration parade The gown that she wore to the inaugural balls was the same one that she had worn six years earlier at the Atlanta balls when Jimmy became governor [35]\n\n\nMental health campaign\nIn March 1977, Carter gave her first interview since becoming first lady She outlined her goals in focusing on mental health: \"For every person who needs mental health care to be able to receive it close to his home, and to remove the stigma from mental health care so people will be free to talk about it and seek help It's been taboo for so long to admit you had a mental health problem.\" [50]\n\n\nInfluence\nAfter Carter had been first lady for two years, Time magazine called her the \"second most powerful person in the United States.\" Many times, Carter's husband called her an equal partner He also said she was a \"perfect extension of myself.\" [51] During a 1977 interview, Carter admitted that she quarreled with him over his policies but his own decision was what he acted on, and she denied influencing his major decisions [52] In an interview the following year, Carter stated that she did not publicly disagree with her husband's policies out of a belief that she \"would lose all my effectiveness with him\" as well as her opinion that the gesture would not assist in changing his perspective to her own [53] She said that a first lady could influence officials or the public by discussing an issue or giving attention to it [54]\n\n\nTravels\nCarter represented her husband in meetings with domestic and foreign leaders, most notably as an envoy to Latin America in 1977 [58] She purposely scheduled her meetings so as not to have any with the heads of state [59] President Carter said that while his wife had initially been met with hesitance as an American representative, \"at the conclusion of those meetings, they now rely on her substantially to be sure that I understand the sensitivities of the people\" [53] Following the Latin America meetings, David Vidal observed, \"Mrs Carter has achieved a personal and diplomatic success that goes far beyond the modest expectations of both her foreign policy tutors at the State Department and her hosts.\" [60]\n\n\nLife in the White House\nCarter was the first of all the First Ladies to keep her own office in the East Wing [70] She also oversaw her family at the White House Her daughter, Amy, attracted much public attention The two youngest sons, Chip and Jeff, and their families also lived in the White House Other members of the family, including son Jack and his wife and children, were frequent visitors Carter's Secret Service codename was \"Dancer\" [71] In 1977, Carter reported that her family was divided in their reaction to public perception of them, saying her sons were worried about how they would be perceived living there while she personally thought nothing of it as the public was not financing their residence and she favored the family being together [72]\n\n\nEqual Rights Amendment\nDuring the 1976 campaign, Carter spoke to feminists about her equal partnership with her husband [75] In January 1977, prior to his inauguration, Carter substituted for him in speaking with Senator Birch Bayh over

approved in an Indiana Senate vote of 26 to 24 [76]\n\n\nPublic image\nDuring the 1976 election cycle, journalists dubbed Carter the \"steel magnolia\" for having a fragile and feminine appearance

his re-election bid in the Democratic presidential primaries [83] He would later write that the ongoing Iran hostage crisis impacted his choice to rely on his wife among others in his administration to advocate for his policies on the campaign trail [84] Vice President Mondale would come to view himself and Rosalynn as President Carter's proxies through much of the spring portion of the election cycle [85] She would reflect that the Iowa victory of the Carter re-election campaign, which saw President Carter defeat Kennedy 59.2% to 31.2%, made it easier for her to be unbothered by Kennedy's attacks [86] Although President Carter was able to secure the nomination, [87] Rosalynn would come to believe that Kennedy had damaged the Democratic Party through his campaign and inadequately assisted in the general election: \"He was a poor loser I thought that once he saw that he could not win he would try to help the Democratic Party because I thought it was so important to keep Ronald Reagan out of the White House and I thought he should have helped Instead, he tore the Democratic Party to pieces.\" [88]\n\n\nPersonal life\nTheir families were already acquainted when Rosalynn first

resisted telling her mother she had chosen to marry instead of continuing her education [20] On July 7, 1946, they married in Plains Their marriage caused Rosalynn to cancel her plans to attend

Born on August 18, 1927, in Plains, Georgia, she was a key figure in her husband's presidency and a dedicated advocate for mental health, women's rights, and social justice. This article will explore her life, career, and achievements as a First Lady, as well as her post-presidency endeavors and continued advocacy work.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nEleanor Rosalynn Smith was born on August 18, 1927, in Plains, Georgia. She was the eldest of four children of Wilburn Edgar Smith, an auto mechanic, bus driver, and farmer, and Frances Allethea \"Allie\" Murray Smith, a teacher, dressmaker, and postal worker. Her brothers were William Jerrold \"Jerry\" Smith (1929-2003), an engineer, and Murray Lee Smith (1932-2003), a teacher and minister. Her sister, Lillian Allethea (Smith) Wall (born 1936), known as Allethea, named for her mother and for Lillian Gordy Carter (the Smith and Carter families being friends), is a real estate broker. Rosalynn was named after Rosa Wise Murray, her maternal grandmother.\n\n**Politics**\n\nAfter helping her husband win the governorship of Georgia in 1970, Rosalynn decided to focus her attention mainly in the field of mental health when she was that state's first lady. She was appointed to the Governor's Commission to Improve Services for the Mentally and Emotionally Handicapped. Many of the commission's recommendations were approved and became law. In August 1971, Carter engaged in a statewide tour of mental health facilities across Georgia. She described her efforts on behalf of mentally disabled children as her proudest achievement as First Lady of Georgia.\n\n**First Lady of Georgia (1971-1975)**\n\nAfter helping her husband win the governorship of Georgia in 1970, Rosalynn decided to focus her attention mainly in the field of mental health when she was that state's first lady.

In August 1971, Carter engaged in a statewide tour of mental health facilities across Georgia. She described her efforts on behalf of mentally disabled children as her proudest achievement as First Lady of Georgia.\n\n**1976 Presidential Campaign**\n\nWhen her husband's gubernatorial term ended in January 1975, Rosalynn, Jimmy, and Amy Carter returned to Plains. Jimmy had already announced his plans to run for president of the United States. Rosalynn got back on the campaign trail, this time on a national quest to gather support for her husband. She campaigned alone on his behalf in 41 states. Because of her husband's obscurity at the time, she often had to answer the question, \"Jimmy who?\"\n\n**First Lady of the United States (1977-1981)**\n\nWhen her husband assumed the presidency in January 1977, Rosalynn and Jimmy Carter walked hand-in-hand down Pennsylvania Avenue during his presidential inauguration parade. The gown that she wore to the inaugural balls was the same one that she had worn six years earlier at the Atlanta balls when Jimmy became governor.\n\n**Major Initiatives**\n\nWhen her husband assumed the presidency in January 1977, Rosalynn and Jimmy Carter walked hand-in-hand down Pennsylvania Avenue during his presidential inauguration parade. The gown that she wore to the inaugural balls was the same one that she had worn six years earlier at the Atlanta balls when Jimmy became governor.\n\n**Mental Health Campaign**\n\nIn March 1977, Carter gave her first interview since becoming first lady. She outlined her goals in focusing on mental health: \"For every person who needs mental health care to be able to receive it close to his home, and to remove the stigma from mental health care so people will be free to talk about it and seek help. It's been taboo for so long to admit you had a mental health problem.\"\n\n**Influence**\n\nAfter Carter had been first lady for two years, Time magazine called her the \"second most powerful person in the United States.\" Many times, Carter's husband called her an equal partner. He also said she was a \"perfect extension of myself.\" During a 1977 interview, Carter admitted that she quarreled with him over his policies but his own decision was what he acted on, and she denied influencing his major decisions. In an interview the following year, Carter stated that she did not publicly disagree with her husband's policies out of a belief that she \"would lose all my effectiveness with him\" as well as her opinion that the gesture would not assist in changing his perspective to her own. She said that a first lady could influence officials or the public by discussing an issue or giving attention to it.\n\n**Travels**\n\nCarter represented her husband in meetings with domestic and foreign leaders, most notably as an envoy to Latin America in 1977. She purposely scheduled her meetings so as not to have any with the heads of state. President Carter said that while his wife had initially been met with hesitance as an American representative, \"at the conclusion of those meetings, they now rely on her substantially to be sure that I understand the sensitivities of the people.\" Following the Latin America meetings, David Vidal observed, \"Mrs. Carter has achieved a personal and diplomatic success that goes far beyond the modest expectations of both her foreign policy tutors at the State Department and her hosts.\"\n\n**Life in the White House**\n\nCarter was the first of all the First Ladies to keep her own office in the East Wing. She also oversaw her family at the White House. Her daughter, Amy, attracted much public attention. The two youngest sons, Chip and Jeff, and their families also lived in the White House. Other members of the family, including son Jack and his wife and children, were frequent visitors. Carter's Secret Service codename was \"Dancer.\" In 1977, Carter reported that her family was divided in their reaction to public perception of them, saying her sons were worried about how they would be perceived living there while she personally thought nothing of it as the public was not financing their residence and she favored the family being together.\n\n**Equal Rights Amendment**\n\nDuring the 1976 campaign, Carter spoke to feminists about her equal partnership with her husband. In January 1977, prior to his inauguration, Carter substituted for him in speaking with Senator Birch Bayh over the phone as the latter wanted President-elect Carter to lobby for support of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) being ratified in Indiana. She persuaded Wayne Townsend to switch his vote and the ERA was approved in an Indiana Senate vote of 26 to 24.\n\n**Public Image**\n\nDuring the 1976 election cycle, journalists dubbed Carter the \"steel magnolia\" for having a fragile and feminine appearance that concealed a \"tough as nails\" interior. Carter was known for a lack of attention paid to fashion, and her choice to wear the gown she wore at her husband's swearing in as Governor to his presidential inauguration reinforced this view of her. Carter's public interest in national policy prompted Kandy Stroud of The New York Times to speculate she might become the most activist first lady since Eleanor Roosevelt. Amid the sinking approval ratings of her husband, Carter maintained high favorable viewpoints in the eyes of the public, and was tied with Mother Teresa for most admired woman in the world. In April 1979, during her speech as guest speaker at the 1979 Matrix Awards Luncheon of New York Women in Communications Inc., Carter said the issues she was championing were being met with opposition due to their lack of sexiness in being topics a first lady discusses.\n\n**1980 Presidential Campaign**\n\nPresident Carter was challenged by Ted Kennedy for his re-election bid in the Democratic presidential primaries. He would later write that the ongoing Iran hostage crisis impacted his choice to rely on his wife among others in his administration to advocate for his policies on the campaign trail. Vice President Mondale would come to view himself and Rosalynn as President Carter's proxies through much of the spring portion of the election cycle. She would reflect that the Iowa victory of the Carter re-election campaign, which saw President Carter defeat Kennedy 59.2% to 31.2%, made it easier for her to be unbothered by Kennedy's attacks.

Amy, attracted much public attention The two youngest sons, Chip and Jeff, and their families also lived in the White House Other members of the family, including son Jack and his wife and children, were frequent visitors Carter's Secret Service codename was \"Dancer\" [71] In 1977, Carter reported that her family was divided in their reaction to public perception of them, saying her sons were worried about how they would be perceived living there while she personally thought nothing of it as the public was not financing their residence and she favored the family being together [72]\n\n\nEqual Rights Amendment\nDuring the 1976 campaign, Carter spoke to feminists about her equal partnership with her husband [75] In January 1977, prior to his inauguration, Carter substituted for him in speaking with Senator Birch Bayh over the phone as the latter wanted President-elect Carter to lobby for support of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) being ratified in Indiana She persuaded Wayne Townsend to switch his vote and the ERA was approved in an Indiana Senate vote of 26 to 24 [76]\n\n\nPublic image\nDuring the 1976 election cycle, journalists dubbed Carter the \"steel magnolia\" for having a fragile and feminine appearance that concealed a \"tough as nails\" interior [78] Carter was known for a lack of attention paid to fashion, and her choice to wear the gown she wore at her husband's swearing in as Governor to his presidential inauguration reinforced this view of her [79] Carter's public interest in national policy prompted Kandy Stroud of The New York Times to speculate she might become the most activist first lady since Eleanor Roosevelt [80] Amid the sinking approval ratings of her husband, Carter maintained high favorable viewpoints in the eyes of the public, and was tied with Mother Teresa for most admired woman in the world [81] In April 1979, during her speech as guest speaker at the 1979 Matrix Awards Luncheon of New York Women in Communications Inc., Carter said the issues she was championing were being met with opposition due to their lack of sexiness in being topics a first lady discusses [82]\n\n\n1980 presidential campaign\nPresident Carter was challenged by Ted Kennedy for his re-election bid in the Democratic presidential primaries [83] He would later write that the ongoing Iran hostage crisis impacted his choice to rely on his wife among others in his administration to advocate for his policies on the campaign trail [84] Vice President Mondale would come to view himself and Rosalynn as President Carter's proxies through much of the spring portion of the election cycle [85] She would reflect that the Iowa victory of the Carter re-election campaign, which saw President Carter defeat Kennedy 59.2% to 31.2%, made it easier for her to be unbothered by Kennedy's attacks [86] Although President Carter was able to secure the nomination, [87] Rosalynn would come to believe that Kennedy had damaged the Democratic Party through his campaign and inadequately assisted in the general election: \"He was a poor loser I thought that once he saw that he could not win he would try to help the Democratic Party because I thought it was so important to keep Ronald Reagan out of the White House and I thought he should have helped Instead, he tore the Democratic Party to pieces.\" [88]\n\n\nPersonal life\nTheir families were already acquainted when Rosalynn first dated Jimmy Carter in 1945 while he was attending the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis She became attracted to him after seeing a picture of him in his Annapolis uniform [5] The two were riding in the back seat of the car of Ruth Carter Stapleton's boyfriend when Jimmy surprised Rosalynn by kissing her This was the first time that Rosalynn had ever allowed a boy to do so on the first date [97] Rosalynn agreed to marry Jimmy in February 1946 when she went to Annapolis with his parents The two scheduled their marriage to take place in July and kept the arrangement secret Rosalynn resisted telling her mother she had chosen to marry instead of continuing her education [20] On July 7, 1946, they married in Plains Their marriage caused Rosalynn to cancel her plans to attend Georgia State College for Women, where she had planned to study interior design [21]\n\n\nMarriage and family\nTheir families

Rosalynn to cancel her plans to attend Georgia State College for Women, where she had planned to study interior design [21]\n\n\nHealth and death\nIn April 1977, Carter underwent surgery to remove a nonmalignant breast tumor [114] [115] She underwent a gynecological procedure at Bethesda Naval Hospital in August 1977, [116] which her press secretary Mary Hoyt described as a routine private matter [117]\n\n\nFuneral\nOn November 27, a motorcade which began in Plains arrived in Americus, where Carter's casket was carried from the Phoebe Sumter Medical Center to a waiting hearse by former members of Carter's United States Secret Service detail [125] [126] The motorcade stopped at Carter's alma mater Georgia Southwestern State University (GSW), where GSW president Neal Weaver and Jennifer Olsen, CEO of the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregivers, [127] placed two wreaths near her statue at the university's Rosalynn Carter Health and Human Sciences Complex [125] [126] [128] The motorcade then traveled via Interstates 75 and 285 to The Carter Center in Atlanta, where she lay in repose at the center's Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum During this time, a service was held and the public paid their respects [125] [129] [130] [131] [132]\n\n\nActivism\nAfter the Carters left the White House in 1981, they continued to lead a very active life In 1982, she co-founded the Carter Center, a private, nonprofit institution based in Atlanta, Georgia The Carters returned to the home they had built in 1961 in Plains, Georgia She was a member of the center's board of trustees and participated in many of the center's programs, but gave special attention to the mental health program [144] Carter and her husband fell into serious debt immediately after leaving the White House, but were able to pay off their debts by engaging in writing projects and eventually were able to open the Carter Center from their revenue She, like Betty Ford before her, would say the American people made a mistake in not re-electing her husband and was bitter over the election [145] At this time she expressed resentment of Ronald Reagan, and even told interviewer Mike Wallace that he was ruining the country Rumors at this time spread that she was running for Governor of Georgia, which she denied and outright stated that she had no political ambition [146] Nearly two decades later when Hillary Clinton was pondering whether or not to run for Senator in New York, Carter was asked why she had not run for the Georgia Senate She responded \"What would I have done in

The ship, with its impressive size and advanced technology, has been the subject of much interest and scrutiny.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe Ever Given (IMO 9811000) is one of 13 container ships built to the Imabari 20000 design developed by Imabari Shipbuilding. 11 of these ships have been chartered by Evergreen Marine, with names starting with \"Ever G\". The ship was laid down on 25 December 2015, launched on 9 May 2018, and completed on 25 September 2018. It is Evergreen's second ship to be named Ever Given; the first one (IMO 8320901) was built in 1986 and has since been broken up.\n\n**Operational History**\n\nThe Ever Given has had a significant operational history, with several notable incidents. On 9 February 2019, the ship collided with and heavily damaged Finkenwerder, a 25-metre-long (82 ft) HADAG ferry boat that was berthed at Blankenese, near the harbour of Hamburg. Two minutes after the collision, a traffic ban on the Elbe river was mandated due to high winds.\n\n**2019 Hamburg Collision**\n\nThe collision between the Ever Given and Finkenwerder was a significant incident that drew attention to the ship's operations. The ship was traveling through the harbour of Hamburg when it struck the ferry boat, causing significant damage. The incident highlighted the importance of safety protocols and the need for careful navigation in busy waterways.\n\n**2021 Suez Canal Grounding**\n\nThe most significant incident involving the Ever Given occurred on 23 March 2021, when the ship became stuck in the Suez Canal. At 07:40 Eastern European Time (UTC+02:00), the ship was passing through the canal on its way to Rotterdam from Tanjung Pelepas. According to a statement by the Suez Canal Authority (SCA), the ship ran aground diagonally after losing the ability to steer amid high winds and a dust storm. In a separate statement, Evergreen Marine said that it had been told the ship \"was suspected of being hit by a sudden strong wind, causing the hull to deviate from [the] waterway and accidentally hit the bottom\".\n\nThe ship ended up with its bow wedged in one bank of the canal and its stern nearly touching the other. The incident caused significant disruptions to global trade, with over 350 ships waiting to pass through the canal. The SCA worked to free the ship, with a team of experts and heavy machinery deployed to the scene.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe incident had significant consequences for the ship's owners and the SCA. On 13 April, the SCA announced that the ship had been seized on court orders until the owners paid $900 million in damages. However, a settlement was eventually reached, with the SCA agreeing to accept $540 million in compensation. The ship departed from the Suez Canal on 7 July for scheduled deliveries of cargo at several European ports.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Suez Canal\n* Container shipping\n* Maritime accidents\n* Imabari Shipbuilding\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Evergreen Marine\n* Imabari Shipbuilding\n* Suez Canal Authority", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ever_Given\" following this outline:\n\n\nDescription\nEver Given (IMO 9811000) is one of 13 container ships built to the Imabari 20000 design developed by Imabari Shipbuilding, 11 of which have been chartered by Evergreen Marine with names starting with \"Ever G\" [4] The ship was laid down on 25 December 2015, launched on 9 May 2018 and completed on 25 September 2018 [3] It is Evergreen's second ship to be named Ever Given; the first one (IMO 8320901) was built in 1986 and has since been broken up [14]\n\n\nOperational history\nOn 9 February 2019, the ship collided with and heavily damaged Finkenwerder, a 25-metre-long (82 ft) HADAG ferry boat which was berthed at Blankenese, near the harbour of Hamburg [15] [16] Two minutes after the collision, a traffic ban on the Elbe river was mandated due to high winds [17]\n\n\n2019 Hamburg collision\nOn 9 February 2019, the ship collided with and heavily damaged Finkenwerder, a 25-metre-long (82 ft) HADAG ferry boat which was berthed at Blankenese, near the harbour of Hamburg [15] [16] Two minutes after the collision, a traffic ban on the Elbe river was mandated due to high winds [17]\n\n\n2021 Suez Canal grounding\nAt 07:40 Eastern European Time (UTC+02:00) on 23 March 2021, as it was passing through the Suez Canal on its way to Rotterdam from Tanjung Pelepas, [9] [18] Ever Given became stuck (coordinates 30°01′03″N 32°34′49″E﻿ / ﻿30.01761°N 32.58018°E﻿ / 30.01761; 32.58018) near the village of Manshiyet Rugola [19] and blocked the canal [8] According to a statement by the Suez Canal Authority (SCA), the ship ran aground diagonally after losing the ability to steer amid high winds and a dust storm [20] In a separate statement, Evergreen Marine said that it had been told the ship \"was suspected of being hit by a sudden strong wind, causing the hull to deviate from  [the] waterway and accidentally hit the bottom\" [1] [20] The ship ended up with her bow wedged in one bank of the canal and stern nearly touching the other [21]\n\n\nAftermath\nOn 13 April, the SCA announced that the ship had been seized on court orders until the owners paid $900 million in damages [36] On 4 July 2021 the German newspaper Der Spiegel reported that the owners and the SCA had agreed on compensation, although the exact amount remained unclear [37] The settlement had been lowered to $540 million by the Suez Canal Authority [38] [39] The ship departed from the Suez Canal on 7 July for scheduled deliveries of cargo at several European ports [40]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Davidson, Larrañaga was an assistant coach to Terry Holland and also the freshman team coach In his five years under Holland, Davidson won three regular season Southern Conference titles, reached the NIT once, and he amassed a 47–12 record as freshman coach In 1976, he moved to Belgium in order to serve as player-coach for a professional club, but only stayed there for one season.\n\n\nBowling Green\nIn 1986, Larrañaga left the University of Virginia for the head coaching job at Bowling Green State University In his first season there, the Falcons improved by eight games over the 1985–86 season, finishing 15–14 He went on to record a 170–144 record in 11 years there, and was only the second coach in Bowling Green history to take the Falcons to postseason play in consecutive years (the 1990 and 1991 editions of the NIT) During his tenure at Bowling Green the Falcons defeated the perennial national powers Kentucky, Michigan State (twice), Ohio State, Penn State and Purdue In his final season at Bowling Green (1996–97), he led the Falcons to a regular-season co-championship in the Mid-American Conference and another NIT berth, and was also named the conference's Coach of the Year He is still the second-winningest coach in school history (behind only Hall of Famer Harold Anderson), as well as one of the winningest coaches in the Mid-American Conference One notable NBA player who played for Larrañaga was guard Antonio Daniels, [5] who was selected fourth overall in the 1997 draft.\n\n\nGeorge Mason\nLarrañaga arrived at George Mason in 1997 His first team only went 9–18, but signs of improvement were present In the 1998–99 season, the Patriots went 19–11, won the school's first Colonial Athletic Association regular-season title in history, and won the conference tournament to advance to the NCAA tournament The Patriots would again go to the NCAA tournament in 2001 and two NITs in 2002 and 2004 The 2004 team was notable as Mason's first 20-win team in 14 years, and also won consecutive postseason games for the first time in school history.\n\n\n2004–05 season\nThe 2004–05 team, with three junior starters but dominated by freshmen and sophomores, went 16–13 However, these players would prove themselves the following season.\n\n\n2005–06: The dream season\nThe Patriots entered the 2005–06 season as a strong contender for the CAA title They entered the conference tournament 22–6, finishing in a tie for the regular-season title with UNC Wilmington Near the end of the regular season, they were briefly ranked in the Top 25 in the ESPN/USA Today poll, the school's first ranking ever, and were on the brink of making it to the Associated Press poll They also narrowly lost to Wake Forest and Mississippi State, and survived a tough match at Wichita State in the ESPN-sponsored BracketBusters event.\n\n\n2010–11: The Revival\nThe 2010–2011 season brought great promise for the Patriots Led by seniors Cam Long and Isiah Tate, the Patriots' campaign started off with mixed emotions as they dropped two games vs NC State and Wofford From then, the Patriots sparked a seven-game winning streak including a key home win in the 'Battle of the Orange Line' versus George Washington University The following four games proved to be a test as GMU traveled to the University of Dayton, played at home versus the University of Delaware, and away at both Hofstra University and at Old Dominion University After the lowly spell of dropping three of those four, the Patriots became red hot as they went undefeated during the regular season winning 16 straight games including a crucial conference game at Virginia Commonwealth University Heading into the CAA tournament, the ESPN/USA Today Coaches' Poll ranked George Mason as the number 25 team in the country, which was their first national ranking since 2006 when they made the improbable run to the Final Four Senior Cam Long was voted first team all-conference and Coach Larrañaga was awarded the coach of the year GMU would fall from the rankings after a semifinal loss to VCU in the conference tournament.\n\n\nUniversity of Miami\nOn April 22, 2011, Larrañaga accepted the head coaching position at the University of Miami [8] In his first season with the Hurricanes, he led the team to a 9–7 record in-conference, which marked the university's first-ever winning record in the

His grandfather, also named Jim Larrañaga, was born in Cuba to Basque parents and was part of the prestigious Por Larrañaga cigar company. Larrañaga grew up in the Parkchester section of the Bronx in New York City, one of six children. His father's Cuban heritage has had a lasting impact on Larrañaga's life and coaching philosophy.\n\nLarrañaga attended DeMatha Catholic High School in Hyattsville, Maryland, where he developed a passion for basketball. He went on to play college basketball at Bowling Green State University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in education. Larrañaga's time at Bowling Green laid the foundation for his coaching career, as he was exposed to the game's nuances and developed a strong work ethic.\n\n**Coaching Career**\n\nLarrañaga's coaching career began in the early 1970s, when he joined the staff at the University of Virginia as an assistant coach under Terry Holland. During his five-year tenure, the Cavaliers won three regular season Southern Conference titles and reached the NIT once. Larrañaga's success at Virginia caught the attention of the coaching community, and he was soon offered the head coaching position at Bowling Green State University.\n\n**Bowling Green**\n\nIn 1986, Larrañaga left the University of Virginia for the head coaching job at Bowling Green State University.

His first team went 9-18, but signs of improvement were present. In the 1998-99 season, the Patriots went 19-11, won the school's first Colonial Athletic Association regular-season title in history, and won the conference tournament to advance to the NCAA tournament.\n\nThe 1999-2000 season was a breakthrough year for the Patriots, as they went 22-10 and won the conference regular-season title. Larrañaga's team returned to the NCAA tournament in 2001 and won two NITs in 2002 and 2004. The 2004 team was notable for its 20-win season, which was Mason's first in 14 years. The team also won consecutive postseason games for the first time in school history.\n\n**2004-05 Season**\n\nThe 2004-05 team, with three junior starters, dominated by freshmen and sophomores, went 16-13. However, these players would prove themselves the following season.\n\n**2005-06: The Dream Season**\n\nThe 2005-06 season was a dream season for the Patriots, as they entered the conference tournament 22-6, finishing in a tie for the regular-season title with UNC Wilmington. Near the end of the regular season, they were briefly ranked in the Top 25 in the ESPN/USA Today poll, the school's first ranking ever. The team narrowly lost to Wake Forest and Mississippi State, and survived a tough match at Wichita State in the ESPN-sponsored BracketBusters event.\n\n**2010-11: The Revival**\n\nThe 2010-11 season brought great promise for the Patriots, led by seniors Cam Long and Isiah Tate. The team started off with mixed emotions, dropping two games vs NC State and Wofford. However, they sparked a seven-game winning streak, including a key home win in the \"Battle of the Orange Line\" versus George Washington University.\n\nThe following four games proved to be a test for the Patriots, as they traveled to the University of Dayton, played at home versus the University of Delaware, and away at both Hofstra University and at Old Dominion University. After dropping three of those four, the Patriots became red hot, going undefeated during the regular season, winning 16 straight games, including a crucial conference game at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nHeading into the CAA tournament, the ESPN/USA Today Coaches' Poll ranked George Mason as the number 25 team in the country, their first national ranking since 2006. Senior Cam Long was voted first team all-conference, and Coach Larrañaga was awarded the coach of the year. However, the Patriots fell from the rankings after a semifinal loss to VCU in the conference tournament.\n\n**University of Miami**\n\nOn April 22, 2011, Larrañaga accepted the head coaching position at the University of Miami. In his first season with the Hurricanes, he led the team to a 9-7 record in-conference, marking the university's first-ever winning record in the ACC.\n\n**Other Achievements**\n\nIn August 2007, Larrañaga was appointed as an associate professor in the George Mason University School of Management (SOM) in the school's Executive MBA program. Although his basketball schedule only allowed him to teach part-time, he was a frequent presenter in classes on leadership, management, and team development, and often spoke at school-sponsored seminars. He had been a guest lecturer at SOM since arriving at George Mason in 1997.\n\n**Head Coaching Record**\n\n| Institution | Years | Record | Pct. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bowling Green State

The story begins with Qala winning the prestigious \"Golden Vinyl\" award, which is a testament to her exceptional singing talent. However, when Qala is interviewed by several journalists, she is asked about her brother, to which she replies that she does not have a brother. This sparks a series of flashbacks that reveal the truth about Qala's past.\n\nIn a flashback, it is revealed that Qala's mother, Urmila, was pregnant with twins. Unfortunately, Qala's stillborn brother did not survive, and in a fit of rage, Urmila attempts to smother Qala. This traumatic event sets the tone for the rest of the film, as Qala grows up with a deep-seated fear of her mother's wrath.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Qala's relationships with her mother and the people around her become increasingly complicated. Her mother's possessiveness and jealousy of Qala's talent create tension, while Qala's own ambitions and desires lead her to make choices that further strain their relationship.\n\n## Cast\n\nThe film was announced by Netflix on April 10, 2021, with Tripti Dimri cast in the title role.

{"title": "Islamic_Emirate_of_Afghanistan", "content": "\nEtymology\nSome scholars suggest that the root name Afghān is derived from the Sanskrit word Aśvakan, which was the name used for ancient inhabitants of the Hindu Kush [40] Aśvakan literally means \"horsemen\", \"horse breeders\", or \"cavalrymen\" (from aśva, the Sanskrit and Avestan words for \"horse\") [41]\n\n\nHistory\nExcavations of prehistoric sites suggest that humans were living in what is now Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities in the area were among the earliest in the world An important site of early historical activities, many believe that Afghanistan compares to Egypt in the historical value of its archaeological sites [46] [47] Artifacts typical of the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze, and Iron Ages have been found in Afghanistan Urban civilization is believed to have begun as early as 3000 BCE, and the early city of Mundigak (near Kandahar in the south of the country) was a center of the Helmand culture More recent findings established that the Indus Valley Civilization stretched up towards modern-day Afghanistan An Indus Valley site has been found on the Oxus River at Shortugai in northern Afghanistan [48] [49] [50]\n\n\nPrehistory and antiquity\nExcavations of prehistoric sites suggest that humans were living in what is now Afghanistan at least

Valley Civilization stretched up towards modern-day Afghanistan An Indus Valley site has been found on the Oxus River at Shortugai in northern Afghanistan [48] [49] [50]\n\n\nMedieval period\nArab Muslims brought Islam to Herat and Zaranj in 642 CE and began spreading eastward; some of the native inhabitants they encountered accepted it while others revolted Before the arrival of Islam, the region used to be home to various beliefs and cults, often resulting in Syncretism between the dominant religions [63] [64] such as Zoroastrianism, [53] [54] [55] Buddhism or Greco-Buddhism, Ancient Iranian religions, [65] Hinduism, Christianity, [66] [67] and Judaism [68] [69] An exemplification of the syncretism in the region would be that people were patrons of Buddhism but still worshipped local Iranian gods such as Ahura Mazda, Lady Nana, Anahita or Mihr (Mithra) and portrayed Greek gods as protectors of Buddha [70] [65] [71] The Zunbils and Kabul Shahi were first conquered in 870 CE by the Saffarid Muslims of Zaranj Later, the Samanids extended their Islamic influence south of the Hindu Kush The Ghaznavids rose to power in the 10th century [72] [73] [74]\n\n\nHotak dynasty\nIn 1709, Mirwais Hotak, a local Ghilzai tribal leader, successfully rebelled against the Safavids He defeated Gurgin Khan, the Georgian governor of Kandahar under the Safavids, and established his own kingdom [91] Mirwais died in 1715, and was succeeded by his brother Abdul Aziz, who was soon killed by Mirwais's son Mahmud for possibly planning to sign a peace with the Safavids Mahmud led the Afghan army in 1722 to the Persian capital of Isfahan, and captured the city after the Battle of Gulnabad and proclaimed himself King of Persia [91] The Afghan dynasty was ousted from Persia by Nader Shah after the 1729 Battle of Damghan.\n\n\nDurrani Empire\nAfter the death of Nader Shah in 1747, Ahmad Shah Durrani had returned to Kandahar with a contingent of 4,000 Pashtuns The Abdalis had \"unanimously accepted\" Ahmad Shah as their new leader With his ascension in 1747, Ahmad Shah had led multiple campaigns against the Mughal empire, Maratha empire, and then-receding Afsharid empire Ahmad Shah had captured Kabul and Peshawar from the Mughal appointed governor, Nasir Khan Ahmad Shah had then conquered Herat in 1750, and had also captured Kashmir in 1752 [94] Ahmad Shah had launched two campaigns into Khorasan, 1750–1751 and 1754–1755 [95] His first campaign had seen the siege of Mashhad, however, he was forced to retreat after four months In November 1750, he moved to siege Nishapur, but he was unable to capture the city and was forced to retreat in early 1751 Ahmad Shah returned in 1754; he captured Tun, and on 23 July, he sieged Mashhad once again Mashhad had fallen on 2 December, but Shahrokh was reappointed in 1755 He was forced to give up Torshiz, Bakharz, Jam, Khaf, and Turbat-e Haidari to the Afghans, as well as accept Afghan sovereignty Following this, Ahmad Shah sieged Nishapur once again, and captured it.\n\n\nBarakzai dynasty and British wars\nBy the early 19th century, the Afghan empire was under threat from the Persians in the west and the Sikh Empire in the east Fateh Khan, leader of the Barakzai tribe, installed many of his brothers in positions of power throughout the empire Fateh Khan was brutally murdered in 1818 by Mahmud Shah As a result, the brothers of Fateh Khan and the Barakzai tribe rebelled, and a civil war brewed During this turbulent period, Afghanistan fractured into many states, including the Principality of Qandahar, Emirate of Herat, Khanate of Qunduz, Maimana Khanate, and numerous other warring polities The most prominent state was the Emirate of Kabul, ruled by Dost Mohammad Khan [108] [109]\n\n\nDemocratic Republic and Soviet war\nIn April 1978, the communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) seized power in a bloody coup d'état against then-President Mohammed Daoud Khan, in what is called the Saur Revolution The PDPA declared the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, with its first leader named as People's Democratic Party General Secretary Nur Muhammad Taraki [132] This would trigger a series of events that would dramatically turn Afghanistan from a poor and secluded (albeit peaceful) country to a hotbed of international terrorism [133] The PDPA initiated various social, symbolic, and land distribution reforms that provoked strong opposition, while also brutally oppressing political dissidents This caused unrest and quickly expanded into a state of civil war by 1979, waged by guerrilla mujahideen (and smaller Maoist guerrillas) against regime forces countrywide It quickly turned into a proxy war as the Pakistani government provided these rebels with covert training centers, the United States supported them through Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), [134] and the Soviet Union sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA regime [135] Meanwhile, there was increasingly hostile friction between the competing factions of the PDPA – the dominant Khalq and the more moderate Parcham [136]\n\n\nPost–Cold War conflict\nAnother civil war broke out after the creation of a dysfunctional coalition government between leaders of various mujahideen factions Amid a state of anarchy and factional infighting, [155] [156] [157] various mujahideen factions committed widespread rape, murder and extortion, [156] [158] [159] while Kabul was heavily bombarded and partially destroyed by the fighting [159] Several failed reconciliations and alliances occurred between different leaders [160] The Taliban emerged in September 1994 as a movement and militia of students (talib) from Islamic madrassas (schools) in Pakistan, [159] [161] who soon had military support from Pakistan [162] Taking control of Kandahar city that year, [159] they conquered more territories until finally driving out the government of Rabbani from Kabul in 1996, [163] [164] where they established an emirate [165] The Taliban were condemned internationally for the harsh enforcement of their interpretation of Islamic sharia law, which resulted in the brutal treatment of many Afghans, especially women [166] [167] During their rule, the Taliban and their allies committed massacres against Afghan civilians, denied UN food supplies to starving civilians and conducted a policy of scorched earth, burning vast areas of fertile land and destroying tens of thousands of homes [168] [169] [170] [171] [172] [173] [excessive citations]\n\n\nUS invasion and Islamic Republic\nIn October 2001, the United States invaded Afghanistan to remove the Taliban from power after they refused to hand over Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect of the September 11 attacks, who was a \"guest\" of the Taliban and was operating his al-Qaeda network in Afghanistan [179] [180] [181] The majority of Afghans supported the American invasion [182] [183] During the initial invasion, US and UK forces bombed al-Qaeda training camps, and later working with the Northern Alliance, the Taliban regime came to an end [184]\n\n\nSecond Taliban era\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced on 14 April 2021 that the alliance had agreed to start withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan by 1 May [210] Soon after NATO troops began withdrawing, the Taliban launched an offensive against the Afghan government and quickly advanced in front of collapsing Afghan government forces [211] [212] The Taliban captured the capital city of Kabul on 15 August 2021, after regaining control over a vast majority of Afghanistan Several foreign diplomats and Afghan government officials, including president Ashraf Ghani, [213] were evacuated from the country, with many Afghan civilians attempting to flee along with them [214] On 17 August, first vice president Amrullah Saleh proclaimed himself caretaker president and announced the formation of an anti-Taliban front with a reported 6,000+ troops [215] [216] in the Panjshir Valley, along with Ahmad Massoud [217] [218] However, by 6 September, the Taliban had taken control of most of Panjshir province, with resistance fighters retreating to the mountains [219] Clashes in the valley ceased mid-September [220]\n\n\nGeography\nAfghanistan is located in Southern-Central Asia [248] [249] [250] [251] [252] The region centered at Afghanistan is considered the \"crossroads of Asia\", [253] and the country has had the nickname Heart of Asia [254] The renowned Urdu poet Allama Iqbal once wrote about the country:\n\n\nClimate\nAfghanistan has a continental climate with harsh winters in the central highlands, the glaciated northeast (around Nuristan), and the Wakhan Corridor, where the average temperature in January is below −15 °C (5 °F) and can reach −26 °C (−15 °F), [259] and hot summers in the low-lying areas of the Sistan Basin of the southwest, the Jalalabad basin in the east, and the Turkestan plains along the Amu River in the north, where temperatures average over 35 °C (95 °F) in July [262] [275] and can go over 43 °C (109 °F) [259] The country is generally arid in the summers, with most rainfall falling between December and April The lower areas of northern and western Afghanistan are the driest, with precipitation more common in the east Although proximate to India, Afghanistan is mostly outside the monsoon zone, [259] except the Nuristan Province which occasionally receives summer monsoon rain [276]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nSeveral types of mammals exist throughout Afghanistan Snow leopards, Siberian tigers and brown bears live in the high elevation alpine tundra regions The Marco Polo sheep exclusively live in the Wakhan Corridor region of north-east Afghanistan Foxes, wolves, otters, deer, wild sheep, lynx and other big cats populate the mountain forest region of the east In the semi-desert northern plains, wildlife include a variety of birds, hedgehogs, gophers, and large carnivores such as jackals and hyenas [277]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nFollowing the effective collapse of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan during the 2021 Taliban offensive, the Taliban declared the country an Islamic Emirate A new caretaker government was announced on 7 September [281] As of 8 September 2021 [update], no other country had formally recognized the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan as the de jure government of Afghanistan [282] According to the V-Dem Democracy indices Afghanistan in 2023 was the third least electoral democratic country in Asia [283]\n\n\nDevelopment of Taliban government\nOn 17 August 2021, the leader of the Taliban-affiliated Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin party, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, met with both Hamid Karzai, the former President of Afghanistan, and Abdullah Abdullah, the former chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation and former Chief Executive, in Doha, Qatar, with the aim of forming a national unity government [288] [289] President Ashraf Ghani, having fled the country during the Taliban advance to either Tajikistan or Uzbekistan, emerged in the United Arab Emirates and said that he supported such negotiations and was in talks to return to Afghanistan [290] [291] Many figures within the Taliban generally agreed that continuation of the 2004 Constitution of Afghanistan may, if correctly applied, be workable as the basis for the new religious state as their objections to the former government were political, and not religious [292]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nAfghanistan is administratively divided into 34 provinces (wilayat) [302] Each province has a governor and a capital The country is further divided into nearly 400 provincial districts, each of which normally covers a city or several villages Each district is represented by a district governor.\n\n\nForeign relations\nAfghanistan became a member of the United Nations in 1946 [306] Historically, Afghanistan had strong relations with Germany, one of the first countries to recognize Afghanistan's independence in 1919; the Soviet Union, which provided much aid and military training for Afghanistan's forces and includes the signing of a Treaty of Friendship in 1921 and 1978; and India, with which a friendship treaty was signed in 1950 [307] Relations with Pakistan have often been tense for various reasons such as the Durand Line border issue and alleged Pakistani involvement in Afghan insurgent groups.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Armed Forces of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan captured a large amount of weapons, hardware, vehicles, aerocrafts, and equipment from the Afghan National Security Forces following the 2021 Taliban offensive and the Fall of Kabul The total value of the captured equipment has been estimated at US$83 billion [312] [313]\n\n\nHuman rights\nHomosexuality is taboo in Afghan society; [314] according to the Penal Code, homosexual intimacy is punished by up to a year in prison [315] Under Sharia law offenders can be punished by death [316] [317] However, an ancient tradition involving male homosexual acts between children and older men (typically wealthy warlords or elite people) called bacha bazi persists.\n\n\nEconomy\nAfghanistan's nominal GDP was $20.1 billion in 2020, or $81 billion by purchasing power parity (PPP) [21] Its GDP per capita is $2,459 (PPP) and $611 by nominal [21] Despite having $1 trillion or more in mineral deposits, [332] it remains one of the world's least developed countries Afghanistan's rough physical geography and its landlocked status has been cited as reasons why the country has always been among the least developed in the modern era – a factor where progress is also slowed by contemporary conflict and political instability [259] The country imports over $7 billion worth of goods but exports only $784 million, mainly fruits and nuts It has $2.8 billion in external debt [262] The service sector contributed the most to the GDP (55.9%) followed by agriculture (23%) and industry (21.1%) [333]\n\n\nAgriculture\nAgricultural production is the backbone of Afghanistan's economy [350] and has traditionally dominated the economy, employing about 40% of the workforce as of 2018 [351] The country is known for producing pomegranates, grapes, apricots, melons, and several other fresh and dry fruits Afghanistan also became the world's top producer of cannabis in 2010 [352] In March 2023, however, cannabis production was banned by a decree from Hibatullah Akhundzada [353]\n\n\nMining\nThe country's natural resources include: coal, copper, iron ore, lithium, uranium, rare earth elements, chromite, gold, zinc, talc, barite, sulfur, lead, marble, precious and semi-precious stones, natural gas, and petroleum [362] [363] In 2010, US and Afghan government officials estimated that untapped mineral deposits located in 2007 by the US Geological Survey are worth at least $1 trillion [364]\n\n\nEnergy\nAccording to the World Bank, 98% of the rural population have access to electricity in 2018, up from 28% in 2008 [378] Overall the figure stands at 98.7% [379] As of 2016, Afghanistan produces 1,400 megawatts of power, but still imports the majority of electricity via transmission lines from Iran and the Central Asian states [380] The majority of electricity production is via hydropower, helped by the amount of rivers and streams that flow from the mountains [381] However electricity is not always reliable and blackouts happen, including in Kabul [382] In recent years an increasing number of solar, biomass and wind power plants have been constructed [383] Currently under development are the CASA-1000 project which will transmit electricity from Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, and the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline [382] Power is managed by the Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS, Afghanistan Electricity Company).\n\n\nTourism\nTourism is a small industry in Afghanistan due to security issues Nevertheless, some 20,000 foreign tourists visit the country annually as of 2016 [384] In particular an important region for domestic and international tourism is the picturesque Bamyan Valley, which includes lakes, canyons and historical sites, helped by the fact it is in a safe area away from insurgent activity [385] [386] Smaller numbers visit and trek in regions such as the Wakhan Valley, which is also one of the world's most remote communities [387] From the late 1960s onwards, Afghanistan was a popular stop on the famous hippie trail, attracting many Europeans and Americans Coming from Iran, the trail traveled through various Afghan provinces and cities including Herat, Kandahar and Kabul before crossing to northern Pakistan, northern India, and Nepal [388] [389] Tourism peaked in 1977, the year before the start of political instability and armed conflict [390]\n\n\nCommunication\nTelecommunication services in Afghanistan are provided by Afghan Telecom, Afghan Wireless, Etisalat, MTN Group, and Roshan The country uses its own space satellite called Afghansat 1, which provides services to millions of phone, internet, and television subscribers By 2001 following years of civil war, telecommunications was virtually a non-existent sector, but by 2016 it had grown to a $2 billion industry, with 22 million mobile phone subscribers and 5 million internet users The sector employs at least 120,000 people nationwide [398]\n\n\nTransportation\nDue to Afghanistan's geography, transport between various parts of the country has historically been difficult The backbone of Afghanistan's road network is Highway 1, often called the \"Ring Road\", which extends for 2,210 kilometres (1,370 mi) and connects five major cities: Kabul, Ghazni, Kandahar, Herat and Mazar-i-Sharif, [399] with spurs to Kunduz and Jalalabad and various border crossings, while skirting around the mountains of the Hindu Kush [400]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe population of Afghanistan was estimated at 32.9 million as of 2019 by the Afghanistan Statistics and Information Authority, [416] whereas the UN estimates over 38.0 million [417] In 1979 the total population was reported to be about 15.5 million [418] About 23.9% of them are urbanite, 71.4% live in rural areas, and the remaining 4.7% are nomadic [419] An additional 3 million or so Afghans are temporarily housed in neighboring Pakistan and Iran, most of whom were born and raised in those two countries As of 2013, Afghanistan was the largest refugee-producing country in the world, a title held for 32 years.\n\n\nPopulation\nThe population of Afghanistan was estimated at 32.9 million as of 2019 by the Afghanistan Statistics and Information

2013, Afghanistan was the largest refugee-producing country in the world, a title held for 32 years.\n\n\nFertility rate\nAfghanistan 2024 total fertility rate has been estimated at 4.4 [424] In 2022 it was 4.5, about twice the world average rate [425] The rate has fallen since the early 1980s [426]\n\n\nUrbanization\nAs estimated by the CIA World Factbook, 26% of the population was urbanized as of 2020 This is one of the lowest figures in the world; in Asia it is only higher than Cambodia, Nepal and Sri Lanka Urbanization has increased rapidly, particularly in the capital Kabul, due to returning refugees from Pakistan and Iran after 2001, internally displaced people, and rural migrants [427] Urbanization in Afghanistan is different from typical urbanization in that it is centered on just a few cities [428]\n\n\nEthnicity and languages\nAfghans are divided into several ethnolinguistic groups According to research data by several institutions in 2019, the Pashtuns are the largest ethnic group, comprising 42%, followed by Tajiks, comprising 27% [4] [5] [6] [430] [8] of the country's population The other two major ethnic groups are the Hazaras and Uzbeks, each at 9% A further 10 other ethnic groups are recognized and each are represented in the Afghan National Anthem [431]\n\n\nReligion\nThe CIA estimated in 2009 that 99.7% of the Afghan population was Muslim [262] and most are thought to adhere to the Sunni Hanafi school [439] According to Pew Research Center, as much as 90% are of the Sunni denomination, 7% Shia and 3% non-denominational [440] The CIA Factbook variously estimates up to 89.7% Sunni or up to 15% Shia [262]\n\n\nEducation\nEducation in Afghanistan is overseen by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Higher Education There are over 16,000 schools in the country and roughly 9 million students Of this, about 60% are males and 40% females However, the new regime has thus far forbidden female teachers and female students from returning to secondary schools [450] [451] Over 174,000 students are enrolled in different universities around the country About 21% of these are females [452] Former Education Minister Ghulam Farooq Wardak had stated that construction of 8,000 schools is required for the remaining children who are deprived of formal learning [453] As of 2018 the literacy rate of the population age 15 and older is 43.02% (males 55.48% and females 29.81%) [454]\n\n\nHealth\nAccording to the Human Development Index, Afghanistan is the 15th least developed country in the world The average life expectancy is estimated to be around 60 years [460] [461] The country's maternal mortality rate is 396 deaths/100,000 live births and its infant mortality rate is 66 [461] to 112.8 deaths in every 1,000 live births [262] The Ministry of Public Health plans to cut the infant mortality rate to 400 for every 100,000 live births before 2020 The country has more than 3,000 midwives, with an additional 300 to 400 being trained each year [462]\n\n\nCulture\nAfghans have both common cultural features and those that differ between the regions of Afghanistan, each with distinctive cultures partly as a result of geographic obstacles that divide the country [259] Family is the mainstay of Afghan society and families are often headed by a patriarch [470] In the southern and eastern region, the people live according to the Pashtun culture by following Pashtunwali (the Pashtun way) [471] Key tenets of Pashtunwali include hospitality, the provision of sanctuary to those seeking refuge, and revenge for the shedding of blood [472] The Pashtuns are largely connected to the culture of Central Asia and the Iranian Plateau The remaining Afghans are culturally Persian and Turkic Some non-Pashtuns who live in proximity with Pashtuns have adopted Pashtunwali in a process called Pashtunization, while some Pashtuns have been Persianized Those who have lived in Pakistan and Iran over the last 30 years have been further influenced by the cultures of those neighboring nations The Afghan people are known to be strongly religious [439]\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe nation has a complex history that has survived either in its current cultures or in the form of various languages and monuments Afghanistan contains many remnants from all ages, including Greek and Buddhist stupas, monasteries, monuments, temples, and Islamic minarets Among the most well known are the Great Mosque of Herat, the Blue Mosque, the Minaret of Jam, the Chil Zena, the Qala-i Bost in Lashkargah, the ancient Greek city of Ai-Khanoum [484] However, many of its historic monuments have been damaged in modern times due to the civil wars [485] The two famous Buddhas of Bamiyan were destroyed by the Taliban, who regarded them as idolatrous As there was no colonialism in the modern era in Afghanistan, European-style architecture is rare but does exist: the Victory Arch at Paghman and the Darul Aman Palace in Kabul were built in this style in the 1920s Afghan architecture also ranges deep into India such as the city of Agra, [486] and the tomb of Sher Shah Suri, an Afghan Emperor of India [487]\n\n\nArt and ceramics\nCarpet weaving is an ancient practice in Afghanistan, and many of these are still handmade by tribal and nomadic people today [428] Carpets have been produced in the region for thousands of years and traditionally done by women [488] Some crafters express their feelings through the designs of rugs; for example after the outbreak of the Soviet–Afghan War, \"war rugs\", a variant of Afghan rugs, were created with designs representing pain and misery caused by the conflict [489] Every province has its own specific characteristics in making rugs [490] In some of the Turkic-populated areas in the north-west, bride and wedding ceremony prices are driven by the bride's weaving skills [491]\n\n\nLiterature\nClassic Persian and Pashto poetry are a cherished part of Afghan culture Poetry has always been one of the major educational pillars in the region, to the level that it has integrated itself into culture [499] One of the poetic styles is called landay A popular theme in Afghan folklore and mythology are Divs, monstrous creatures [500] Thursdays are traditionally \"poetry night\" in the city of Herat when men, women and children gather and recite both ancient and modern poems [501]\n\n\nMusic\nAfghan classical music has close historical links with Indian classical music and use the same Hindustani terminology and theories like raga Genres of this style of music include ghazal (poetic music) and instruments such as the Indian tabla, sitar and harmonium, and local instruments like zerbaghali, as well as dayereh and tanbur which are also known in Central Asia, the Caucasus and the Middle East The rubab is the country's national instrument and precurses the Indian sarod instrument Some of the famous artists of classical music include Ustad Sarahang and Sarban [503]\n\n\nMedia and entertainment\nAfghanistan has around 350 radio stations and over 200 television stations [508] Radio Television Afghanistan, originating from 1925, is the state public broadcaster Television programs began airing in the 1970s and today there are many private television channels such as TOLO and Shamshad TV The first Afghan newspaper was published in 1873, [509] and there are hundreds of print outlets today [508] By the 1920s, Radio Kabul was broadcasting local radio services [510] Voice of America, BBC, and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) broadcast in both of Afghanistan's official languages on radio [511] Press restrictions have been gradually relaxed and private media diversified since 2002, after more than two decades of tight controls.\n\n\nCuisine\nAfghan cuisine is largely based upon the nation's chief crops, such as wheat, maize, barley and rice Accompanying these staples are native fruits and vegetables as well as dairy products such as milk, yogurt, and whey Kabuli palaw is the national dish of Afghanistan [515] The nation's culinary specialties reflect its ethnic and geographic diversity [516] Afghanistan is known for its high-quality pomegranates, grapes, and sweet melons [517] Tea is a favorite drink among Afghans A typical Afghan diet consists of naan, yogurt, rice, and meat [470]\n\n\nHolidays and festivals\nAfghanistan's official New Year starts with Nowruz, an ancient tradition that started as a Zoroastrian celebration in present-day Iran, and with which it shares the annual celebration along with several other countries It occurs every year at the vernal equinox In Afghanistan, Nowruz is typically celebrated with music and dance, as well as holding buzkashi tournaments [518]\n\n\nSports\nSport in Afghanistan is managed by the Afghan Sports Federation Cricket and association football are the two most popular sports in the country [530] [531] The Afghan Sports Federation promotes cricket, association football, basketball, volleyball, golf, handball, boxing, taekwondo, weightlifting, bodybuilding, track and field, skating, bowling, snooker, chess, and other sports.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nGeneral and cited sources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Islamic Emirate of

about \"Islamic_Emirate_of_Afghanistan\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nSome scholars suggest that the root name Afghān is derived from the Sanskrit word Aśvakan, which was the name used for ancient inhabitants of the Hindu Kush [40] Aśvakan literally means \"horsemen\", \"horse breeders\", or \"cavalrymen\" (from aśva, the Sanskrit and Avestan words for \"horse\") [41]\n\n\nHistory\nExcavations of prehistoric sites suggest that humans were living in what is now Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities in the area were among the earliest in the world An important site of early historical activities, many believe that Afghanistan compares to Egypt in the historical value of its archaeological sites [46] [47] Artifacts typical of the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze, and Iron Ages have been found in Afghanistan Urban civilization is believed to have begun as early as 3000 BCE, and the early city of Mundigak (near Kandahar in the south of the country) was a center of the Helmand culture More recent findings established that the Indus Valley Civilization stretched up towards modern-day Afghanistan An Indus Valley site has been found on the Oxus River at Shortugai in northern Afghanistan [48] [49] [50]\n\n\nPrehistory and antiquity\nExcavations of prehistoric sites suggest that humans were living in what

[48] [49] [50]\n\n\nMedieval period\nArab Muslims brought Islam to Herat and Zaranj in 642 CE and began spreading eastward; some of the native inhabitants they encountered accepted it while others revolted Before the arrival of Islam, the region used to be home to various beliefs and cults, often resulting in Syncretism between the dominant religions [63] [64] such as Zoroastrianism, [53] [54] [55] Buddhism or Greco-Buddhism, Ancient Iranian religions, [65] Hinduism, Christianity, [66] [67] and Judaism [68] [69] An exemplification of the syncretism in the region would be that people were patrons of Buddhism but still worshipped local Iranian gods such as Ahura Mazda, Lady Nana, Anahita or Mihr (Mithra) and portrayed Greek gods as protectors of Buddha [70] [65] [71] The Zunbils and Kabul Shahi were first conquered in 870 CE by the Saffarid Muslims of Zaranj Later, the Samanids extended their Islamic influence south of the Hindu Kush The Ghaznavids rose to power in the 10th century [72] [73] [74]\n\n\nHotak dynasty\nIn 1709, Mirwais Hotak, a local Ghilzai tribal leader, successfully rebelled against the Safavids He defeated Gurgin Khan, the Georgian governor of Kandahar under the Safavids, and established his own kingdom [91] Mirwais died in 1715, and was succeeded by his brother Abdul Aziz, who was soon killed by Mirwais's son Mahmud for possibly planning to sign a peace with the Safavids Mahmud led the Afghan army in 1722 to the Persian capital of Isfahan, and captured the city after the Battle of Gulnabad and proclaimed himself King of Persia [91] The Afghan dynasty was ousted from Persia by Nader Shah after the 1729 Battle of Damghan.\n\n\nDurrani Empire\nAfter the death of Nader Shah in 1747, Ahmad Shah Durrani had returned to Kandahar with a contingent of 4,000 Pashtuns The Abdalis had \"unanimously accepted\" Ahmad Shah as their new leader With his ascension in 1747, Ahmad Shah had led multiple campaigns against the Mughal empire, Maratha empire, and then-receding Afsharid empire Ahmad Shah had captured Kabul and Peshawar from the Mughal appointed governor, Nasir Khan Ahmad Shah had then conquered Herat in 1750, and had also captured Kashmir in 1752 [94] Ahmad Shah had launched two campaigns into Khorasan, 1750–1751 and 1754–1755 [95] His first campaign had seen the siege of Mashhad, however, he was forced to retreat after four months In November 1750, he moved to siege Nishapur, but he was unable to capture the city and was forced to retreat in early 1751 Ahmad Shah returned in 1754; he captured Tun, and on 23 July, he sieged Mashhad once again Mashhad had fallen on 2 December, but Shahrokh was reappointed in 1755 He was forced to give up Torshiz, Bakharz, Jam, Khaf, and Turbat-e Haidari to the Afghans, as well as accept Afghan sovereignty Following this, Ahmad Shah sieged Nishapur once again, and captured it.\n\n\nBarakzai dynasty and British wars\nBy the early 19th century, the Afghan empire was under threat from the Persians in the west and the Sikh Empire in the east Fateh Khan, leader of the Barakzai tribe, installed many of his brothers in positions of power throughout the empire Fateh Khan was brutally murdered in 1818 by Mahmud Shah As a result, the brothers of Fateh Khan and the Barakzai tribe rebelled, and a civil war brewed During this turbulent period, Afghanistan fractured into many states, including the Principality of Qandahar, Emirate of Herat, Khanate of Qunduz, Maimana Khanate, and numerous other warring polities The most prominent state was the Emirate of Kabul, ruled by Dost Mohammad Khan [108] [109]\n\n\nDemocratic Republic and Soviet war\nIn April 1978, the communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) seized power in a bloody coup d'état against then-President Mohammed Daoud Khan, in what is called the Saur Revolution The PDPA declared the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, with its first leader named as People's Democratic Party General Secretary Nur Muhammad Taraki [132] This would trigger a series of events that would dramatically turn Afghanistan from a poor and secluded (albeit peaceful) country to a hotbed of international terrorism [133] The PDPA initiated various social, symbolic, and land distribution reforms that provoked strong opposition, while also brutally oppressing political dissidents This caused unrest and quickly expanded into a state of civil war by 1979, waged by guerrilla mujahideen (and smaller Maoist guerrillas) against regime forces countrywide It quickly turned into a proxy war as the Pakistani government provided these rebels with covert training centers, the United States supported them through Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), [134] and the Soviet Union sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA regime [135] Meanwhile, there was increasingly hostile friction between the competing factions of the PDPA – the dominant Khalq and the more moderate Parcham [136]\n\n\nPost–Cold War conflict\nAnother civil war broke out after the creation of a dysfunctional coalition government between leaders of various mujahideen factions Amid a state of anarchy and factional infighting, [155] [156] [157] various mujahideen factions committed widespread rape, murder and extortion, [156] [158] [159] while Kabul was heavily bombarded and partially destroyed by the fighting [159] Several failed reconciliations and alliances occurred between different leaders [160] The Taliban emerged in September 1994 as a movement and militia of students (talib) from Islamic madrassas (schools) in Pakistan, [159] [161] who soon had military support from Pakistan [162] Taking control of Kandahar city that year, [159] they conquered more territories until finally driving out the government of Rabbani from Kabul in 1996, [163] [164] where they established an emirate [165] The Taliban were condemned internationally for the harsh enforcement of their interpretation of Islamic sharia law, which resulted in the brutal treatment of many Afghans, especially women [166] [167] During their rule, the Taliban and their allies committed massacres against Afghan civilians, denied UN food supplies to starving civilians and conducted a policy of scorched earth, burning vast areas of fertile land and destroying tens of thousands of homes [168] [169] [170] [171] [172] [173] [excessive citations]\n\n\nUS invasion and Islamic Republic\nIn October 2001, the United States invaded Afghanistan to remove the Taliban from power after they refused to hand over Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect of the September 11 attacks, who was a \"guest\" of the Taliban and was operating his al-Qaeda network in Afghanistan [179] [180] [181] The majority of Afghans supported the American invasion [182] [183] During the initial invasion, US and UK forces bombed al-Qaeda training camps, and later working with the Northern Alliance, the Taliban regime came to an end [184]\n\n\nSecond Taliban era\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced on 14 April 2021 that the alliance had agreed to start withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan by 1 May [210] Soon after NATO troops began withdrawing, the Taliban launched an offensive against the Afghan government and quickly advanced in front of collapsing Afghan government forces [211] [212] The Taliban captured the capital city of Kabul on 15 August 2021, after regaining control over a vast majority of Afghanistan Several foreign diplomats and Afghan government officials, including president Ashraf Ghani, [213] were evacuated from the country, with many Afghan civilians attempting to flee along with them [214] On 17 August, first vice president Amrullah Saleh proclaimed himself caretaker president and announced the formation of an anti-Taliban front with a reported 6,000+ troops [215] [216] in the Panjshir Valley, along with Ahmad Massoud [217] [218] However, by 6 September, the Taliban had taken control of most of Panjshir province, with resistance fighters retreating to the mountains [219] Clashes in the valley ceased mid-September [220]\n\n\nGeography\nAfghanistan is located in Southern-Central Asia [248] [249] [250] [251] [252] The region centered at Afghanistan is considered the \"crossroads of Asia\", [253] and the country has had the nickname Heart of Asia [254] The renowned Urdu poet Allama Iqbal once wrote about the country:\n\n\nClimate\nAfghanistan has a continental climate with harsh winters in the central highlands, the glaciated northeast (around Nuristan), and the Wakhan Corridor, where the average temperature in January is below −15 °C (5 °F) and can reach −26 °C (−15 °F), [259] and hot summers in the low-lying areas of the Sistan Basin of the southwest, the Jalalabad basin in the east, and the Turkestan plains along the Amu River in the north, where temperatures average over 35 °C (95 °F) in July [262] [275] and can go over 43 °C (109 °F) [259] The country is generally arid in the summers, with most rainfall falling between December and April The lower areas of northern and western Afghanistan are the driest, with precipitation more common in the east Although proximate to India, Afghanistan is mostly outside the monsoon zone, [259] except the Nuristan Province which occasionally receives summer monsoon rain [276]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nSeveral types of mammals exist throughout Afghanistan Snow leopards, Siberian tigers and brown bears live in the high elevation alpine tundra regions The Marco Polo sheep exclusively live in the Wakhan Corridor region of north-east Afghanistan Foxes, wolves, otters, deer, wild sheep, lynx and other big cats populate the mountain forest region of the east In the semi-desert northern plains, wildlife include a variety of birds, hedgehogs, gophers, and large carnivores such as jackals and hyenas [277]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nFollowing the effective collapse of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan during the 2021 Taliban offensive, the Taliban declared the country an Islamic Emirate A new caretaker government was announced on 7 September [281] As of 8 September 2021 [update], no other country had formally recognized the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan as the de jure government of Afghanistan [282] According to the V-Dem Democracy indices Afghanistan in 2023 was the third least electoral democratic country in Asia [283]\n\n\nDevelopment of Taliban government\nOn 17 August 2021, the leader of the Taliban-affiliated Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin party, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, met with both Hamid Karzai, the former President of Afghanistan, and Abdullah Abdullah, the former chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation and former Chief Executive, in Doha, Qatar, with the aim of forming a national unity government [288] [289] President Ashraf Ghani, having fled the country during the Taliban advance to either Tajikistan or Uzbekistan, emerged in the United Arab Emirates and said that he supported such negotiations and was in talks to return to Afghanistan [290] [291] Many figures within the Taliban generally agreed that continuation of the 2004 Constitution of Afghanistan may, if correctly applied, be workable as the basis for the new religious state as their objections to the former government were political, and not religious [292]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nAfghanistan is administratively divided into 34 provinces (wilayat) [302] Each province has a governor and a capital The country is further divided into nearly 400 provincial districts, each of which normally covers a city or several villages Each district is represented by a district governor.\n\n\nForeign relations\nAfghanistan became a member of the United Nations in 1946 [306] Historically, Afghanistan had strong relations with Germany, one of the first countries to recognize Afghanistan's independence in 1919; the Soviet Union, which provided much aid and military training for Afghanistan's forces and includes the signing of a Treaty of Friendship in 1921 and 1978; and India, with which a friendship treaty was signed in 1950 [307] Relations with Pakistan have often been tense for various reasons such as the Durand Line border issue and alleged Pakistani involvement in Afghan insurgent groups.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Armed Forces of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan captured a large amount of weapons, hardware, vehicles, aerocrafts, and equipment from the Afghan National Security Forces following the 2021 Taliban offensive and the Fall of Kabul The total value of the captured equipment has been estimated at US$83 billion [312] [313]\n\n\nHuman rights\nHomosexuality is taboo in Afghan society; [314] according to the Penal Code, homosexual intimacy is punished by up to a year in prison [315] Under Sharia law offenders can be punished by death [316] [317] However, an ancient tradition involving male homosexual acts between children and older men (typically wealthy warlords or elite people) called bacha bazi persists.\n\n\nEconomy\nAfghanistan's nominal GDP was $20.1 billion in 2020, or $81 billion by purchasing power parity (PPP) [21] Its GDP per capita is $2,459 (PPP) and $611 by nominal [21] Despite having $1 trillion or more in mineral deposits, [332] it remains one of the world's least developed countries Afghanistan's rough physical geography and its landlocked status has been cited as reasons why the country has always been among the least developed in the modern era – a factor where progress is also slowed by contemporary conflict and political instability [259] The country imports over $7 billion worth of goods but exports only $784 million, mainly fruits and nuts It has $2.8 billion in external debt [262] The service sector contributed the most to the GDP (55.9%) followed by agriculture (23%) and industry (21.1%) [333]\n\n\nAgriculture\nAgricultural production is the backbone of Afghanistan's economy [350] and has traditionally dominated the economy, employing about 40% of the workforce as of 2018 [351] The country is known for producing pomegranates, grapes, apricots, melons, and several other fresh and dry fruits Afghanistan also became the world's top producer of cannabis in 2010 [352] In March 2023, however, cannabis production was banned by a decree from Hibatullah Akhundzada [353]\n\n\nMining\nThe country's natural resources include: coal, copper, iron ore, lithium, uranium, rare earth elements, chromite, gold, zinc, talc, barite, sulfur, lead, marble, precious and semi-precious stones, natural gas, and petroleum [362] [363] In 2010, US and Afghan government officials estimated that untapped mineral deposits located in 2007 by the US Geological Survey are worth at least $1 trillion [364]\n\n\nEnergy\nAccording to the World Bank, 98% of the rural population have access to electricity in 2018, up from 28% in 2008 [378] Overall the figure stands at 98.7% [379] As of 2016, Afghanistan produces 1,400 megawatts of power, but still imports the majority of electricity via transmission lines from Iran and the Central Asian states [380] The majority of electricity production is via hydropower, helped by the amount of rivers and streams that flow from the mountains [381] However electricity is not always reliable and blackouts happen, including in Kabul [382] In recent years an increasing number of solar, biomass and wind power plants have been constructed [383] Currently under development are the CASA-1000 project which will transmit electricity from Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, and the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline [382] Power is managed by the Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS, Afghanistan Electricity Company).\n\n\nTourism\nTourism is a small industry in Afghanistan due to security issues Nevertheless, some 20,000 foreign tourists visit the country annually as of 2016 [384] In particular an important region for domestic and international tourism is the picturesque Bamyan Valley, which includes lakes, canyons and historical sites, helped by the fact it is in a safe area away from insurgent activity [385] [386] Smaller numbers visit and trek in regions such as the Wakhan Valley, which is also one of the world's most remote communities [387] From the late 1960s onwards, Afghanistan was a popular stop on the famous hippie trail, attracting many Europeans and Americans Coming from Iran, the trail traveled through various Afghan provinces and cities including Herat, Kandahar and Kabul before crossing to northern Pakistan, northern India, and Nepal [388] [389] Tourism peaked in 1977, the year before the start of political instability and armed conflict [390]\n\n\nCommunication\nTelecommunication services in Afghanistan are provided by Afghan Telecom, Afghan Wireless, Etisalat, MTN Group, and Roshan The country uses its own space satellite called Afghansat 1, which provides services to millions of phone, internet, and television subscribers By 2001 following years of civil war, telecommunications was virtually a non-existent sector, but by 2016 it had grown to a $2 billion industry, with 22 million mobile phone subscribers and 5 million internet users The sector employs at least 120,000 people nationwide [398]\n\n\nTransportation\nDue to Afghanistan's geography, transport between various parts of the country has historically been difficult The backbone of Afghanistan's road network is Highway 1, often called the \"Ring Road\", which extends for 2,210 kilometres (1,370 mi) and connects five major cities: Kabul, Ghazni, Kandahar, Herat and Mazar-i-Sharif, [399] with spurs to Kunduz and Jalalabad and various border crossings, while skirting around the mountains of the Hindu Kush [400]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe population of Afghanistan was estimated at 32.9 million as of 2019 by the Afghanistan Statistics and Information Authority, [416] whereas the UN estimates over 38.0 million [417] In 1979 the total population was reported to be about 15.5 million [418] About 23.9% of them are urbanite, 71.4% live in rural areas, and the remaining 4.7% are nomadic [419] An additional 3 million or so Afghans are temporarily housed in neighboring Pakistan and Iran, most of whom were born and raised in those two countries As of 2013, Afghanistan was the largest refugee-producing country in the world, a title held for 32 years.\n\n\nPopulation\nThe population of Afghanistan was estimated at 32.9 million as of 2019 by the Afghanistan Statistics and Information Authority, [416] whereas the UN estimates over 38.0 million [417] In 1979 the total population was reported to be

neighboring Pakistan and Iran, most of whom were born and raised in those two countries As of 2013, Afghanistan was the largest refugee-producing country in the world, a title held for 32 years.\n\n\nFertility rate\nAfghanistan 2024 total fertility rate has been estimated at 4.4 [424] In 2022 it was 4.5, about twice the world average rate [425] The rate has fallen since the early 1980s [426]\n\n\nUrbanization\nAs estimated by the CIA World Factbook, 26% of the population was urbanized as of 2020 This is one of the lowest figures in the world; in Asia it is only higher than Cambodia, Nepal and Sri Lanka Urbanization has increased rapidly, particularly in the capital Kabul, due to returning refugees from Pakistan and Iran after 2001, internally displaced people, and rural migrants [427] Urbanization in Afghanistan is different from typical urbanization in that it is centered on just a few cities [428]\n\n\nEthnicity and languages\nAfghans are divided into several ethnolinguistic groups According to research data by several institutions in 2019, the Pashtuns are the largest ethnic group, comprising 42%, followed by Tajiks, comprising 27% [4] [5] [6] [430] [8] of the country's population The other two major ethnic groups are the Hazaras and Uzbeks, each at 9% A further 10 other ethnic groups are recognized and each are represented in the Afghan National Anthem [431]\n\n\nReligion\nThe CIA estimated in 2009 that 99.7% of the Afghan population was Muslim [262] and most are thought to adhere to the Sunni Hanafi school [439] According to Pew Research Center, as much as 90% are of the Sunni denomination, 7% Shia and 3% non-denominational [440] The CIA Factbook variously estimates up to 89.7% Sunni or up to 15% Shia [262]\n\n\nEducation\nEducation in Afghanistan is overseen by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Higher Education There are over 16,000 schools in the country and roughly 9 million students Of this, about 60% are males and 40% females However, the new regime has thus far forbidden female teachers and female students from returning to secondary schools [450] [451] Over 174,000 students are enrolled in different universities around the country About 21% of these are females [452] Former Education Minister Ghulam Farooq Wardak had stated that construction of 8,000 schools is required for the remaining children who are deprived of formal learning [453] As of 2018 the literacy rate of the population age 15 and older is 43.02% (males 55.48% and females 29.81%) [454]\n\n\nHealth\nAccording to the Human Development Index, Afghanistan is the 15th least developed country in the world The average life expectancy is estimated to be around 60 years [460] [461] The country's maternal mortality rate is 396 deaths/100,000 live births and its infant mortality rate is 66 [461] to 112.8 deaths in every 1,000 live births [262] The Ministry of Public Health plans to cut the infant mortality rate to 400 for every 100,000 live births before 2020 The country has more than 3,000 midwives, with an additional 300 to 400 being trained each year [462]\n\n\nCulture\nAfghans have both common cultural features and those that differ between the regions of Afghanistan, each with distinctive cultures partly as a result of geographic obstacles that divide the country [259] Family is the mainstay of Afghan society and families are often headed by a patriarch [470] In the southern and eastern region, the people live according to the Pashtun culture by following Pashtunwali (the Pashtun way) [471] Key tenets of Pashtunwali include hospitality, the provision of sanctuary to those seeking refuge, and revenge for the shedding of blood [472] The Pashtuns are largely connected to the culture of Central Asia and the Iranian Plateau The remaining Afghans are culturally Persian and Turkic Some non-Pashtuns who live in proximity with Pashtuns have adopted Pashtunwali in a process called Pashtunization, while some Pashtuns have been Persianized Those who have lived in Pakistan and Iran over the last 30 years have been further influenced by the cultures of those neighboring nations The Afghan people are known to be strongly religious [439]\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe nation has a complex history that has survived either in its current cultures or in the form of various languages and monuments Afghanistan contains many remnants from all ages, including Greek and Buddhist stupas, monasteries, monuments, temples, and Islamic minarets Among the most well known are the Great Mosque of Herat, the Blue Mosque, the Minaret of Jam, the Chil Zena, the Qala-i Bost in Lashkargah, the ancient Greek city of Ai-Khanoum [484] However, many of its historic monuments have been damaged in modern times due to the civil wars [485] The two famous Buddhas of Bamiyan were destroyed by the Taliban, who regarded them as idolatrous As there was no colonialism in the modern era in Afghanistan, European-style architecture is rare but does exist: the Victory Arch at Paghman and the Darul Aman Palace in Kabul were built in this style in the 1920s Afghan architecture also ranges deep into India such as the city of Agra, [486] and the tomb of Sher Shah Suri, an Afghan Emperor of India [487]\n\n\nArt and ceramics\nCarpet weaving is an ancient practice in Afghanistan, and many of these are still handmade by tribal and nomadic people today [428] Carpets have been produced in the region for thousands of years and traditionally done by women [488] Some crafters express their feelings through the designs of rugs; for example after the outbreak of the Soviet–Afghan War, \"war rugs\", a variant of Afghan rugs, were created with designs representing pain and misery caused by the conflict [489] Every province has its own specific characteristics in making rugs [490] In some of the Turkic-populated areas in the north-west, bride and wedding ceremony prices are driven by the bride's weaving skills [491]\n\n\nLiterature\nClassic Persian and Pashto poetry are a cherished part of Afghan culture Poetry has always been one of the major educational pillars in the region, to the level that it has integrated itself into culture [499] One of the poetic styles is called landay A popular theme in Afghan folklore and mythology are Divs, monstrous creatures [500] Thursdays are traditionally \"poetry night\" in the city of Herat when men, women and children gather and recite both ancient and modern poems [501]\n\n\nMusic\nAfghan classical music has close historical links with Indian classical music and use the same Hindustani terminology and theories like raga Genres of this style of music include ghazal (poetic music) and instruments such as the Indian tabla, sitar and harmonium, and local instruments like zerbaghali, as well as dayereh and tanbur which are also known in Central Asia, the Caucasus and the Middle East The rubab is the country's national instrument and precurses the Indian sarod instrument Some of the famous artists of classical music include Ustad Sarahang and Sarban [503]\n\n\nMedia and entertainment\nAfghanistan has around 350 radio stations and over 200 television stations [508] Radio Television Afghanistan, originating from 1925, is the state public broadcaster Television programs began airing in the 1970s and today there are many private television channels such as TOLO and Shamshad TV The first Afghan newspaper was published in 1873, [509] and there are hundreds of print outlets today [508] By the 1920s, Radio Kabul was broadcasting local radio services [510] Voice of America, BBC, and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) broadcast in both of Afghanistan's official languages on radio [511] Press restrictions have been gradually relaxed and private media diversified since 2002, after more than two decades of tight controls.\n\n\nCuisine\nAfghan cuisine is largely based upon the nation's chief crops, such as wheat, maize, barley and rice Accompanying these staples are native fruits and vegetables as well as dairy products such as milk, yogurt, and whey Kabuli palaw is the national dish of Afghanistan [515] The nation's culinary specialties reflect its ethnic and geographic diversity [516] Afghanistan is known for its high-quality pomegranates, grapes, and sweet melons [517] Tea is a favorite drink among Afghans A typical Afghan diet consists of naan, yogurt, rice, and meat [470]\n\n\nHolidays and festivals\nAfghanistan's official New Year starts with Nowruz, an ancient tradition that started as a Zoroastrian celebration in present-day Iran, and with which it shares the annual celebration along with several other countries It occurs every year at the vernal equinox In Afghanistan, Nowruz is typically celebrated with music and dance, as well as holding buzkashi tournaments [518]\n\n\nSports\nSport in Afghanistan is managed by the Afghan Sports Federation Cricket and association football are the two most popular sports in the country [530] [531] The Afghan Sports Federation promotes cricket, association football, basketball, volleyball, golf, handball, boxing, taekwondo, weightlifting, bodybuilding, track and field, skating, bowling, snooker, chess, and other sports.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nGeneral and cited sources\n\n\nFurther

they finished, they felt they were ready to produce their own television series [15]\n\n\nWriting\nThe idea of Stranger Things started with how the brothers felt they could take the concept of the 2013 film Prisoners, detailing the moral struggles a father goes through when his daughter is kidnapped, and expand it out over eight or so hours in a serialized television approach As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of \"childlike sensibilities\" they could offer and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans The brothers thought the combination of these things \"was the best thing ever\" To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered \"bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War\" such as Project MKUltra, which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual This also helped them to decide on using 1983 as the time period, as it was a year before the film Red Dawn came out, which focused on Cold War paranoia [15] Subsequently, they were able to use all their own personal inspirations from the 1980s, the decade they were born, as elements of the series, [15] [23] crafting it in the realm of science fiction and horror [24] The Duffer Brothers have cited as influence for the show (among others): Stephen King novels; films produced by Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter, Wes Craven, Robert Zemeckis, George Lucas and Guillermo del Toro; films such as Alien and Stand by Me; Japanese anime such as Akira and Elfen Lied; and video games such as Silent Hill and The Last of Us [22] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32]\n\n\nCasting\nIn June 2015, it was announced that Winona Ryder and David Harbour had joined the series as Joyce and as the unnamed chief of police, respectively [3] The brothers' casting director Carmen Cuba had suggested Ryder for the role of Joyce, which the two were immediately drawn to because of her prominence in 1980s film [15] Levy believed Ryder could \"wretch up the emotional urgency and yet find layers and nuance and different sides of  [Joyce]\" Ryder praised that the show's multiple storylines required her to act for Joyce as \"she's out of her mind, but she's actually kind of onto something\", and that the producers had faith she could pull off the difficult role [36] The Duffer Brothers had been interested in Harbour before, who until Stranger Things primarily had smaller roles as villainous characters, and they felt that he had been \"waiting too long for this opportunity\" to play a lead, while Harbour himself was thrilled by the script and the chance to play \"a broken, flawed, anti-hero character\" [22] [37]\n\n\nFilming\nThe brothers had desired to film the series around the Long Island area to match the initial Montauk concept However, with filming scheduled to take place in November 2015, it was difficult to shoot in Long Island in the cold weather, and the production started scouting locations in and around the Atlanta, Georgia area The brothers, who grew up in North Carolina, found many places that reminded them of their own childhoods in that area, and felt the area would work well with the narrative shift to the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana [21]\n\n\nVisual effects\nTo create the aged effect for the series, a film grain was added over the footage, which was captured by scanning in film stock from the 1980s [34] The Duffers wanted to scare the audience, but not to necessarily make the show violent or gory, following in line with how the 1980s Amblin Entertainment films drove the creation of the PG-13 movie rating It was \"much more about mood and atmosphere and suspense and dread than they are about gore\", though they were not afraid to push into more scary elements, particularly towards the end of the first season [34] The brothers had wanted to avoid any computer-generated effects for the monster and other parts of the series and stay with practical effects However, the six-month filming time left them little time to plan out and test practical effects rigs for some of the shots They went with a middle ground of using constructed props including one for the monster whenever they could, but for other shots, such as when the monster bursts through a wall, they opted to use digital effects Post-production on the first season was completed the week before it was released on Netflix [15]\n\n\nMusic\nThe Stranger Things original soundtrack was composed by Michael Stein and Kyle Dixon of

sympathized with the character, with Laura Bradley of Vanity Fair suggesting that these people found that Barb would be a similar misfit in society, and \"looks more like someone you might actually meet in real life\" compared to the other characters, particularly Nancy, in the series A hashtag \"#ImWithBarb\" grew in popularity after the series' release, and several fan sites and forums were created to support her [74] While Purser will not return for the second season, The Duffer Brothers used the real-life \"Justice for Barb\" movement as inspiration for narrative at the start of the second season, with Nancy addressing the fact \"that no one ever cares about\" Barb [75] Purser and several media outlets took her nomination as Barb for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series in the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards as achieving \"justice for Barb\", highlighting how well her character was received [76] [77] [78]\n\n\nAccolades\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Stranger Things (Season 1)**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nStranger Things is the first season of the American science fiction-horror web television series created by the Duffer Brothers, which premiered on Netflix on July 15, 2016. The season takes place in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana, in the year 1983 and follows the story of a group of children as they investigate the disappearance of one of their friends, a boy named Will Byers. Along the way, they encounter a mysterious girl with psychokinetic abilities and a monstrous creature from the \"Upside Down,\" a dark and alternate dimension.\n\n**Premise**\n\nThe first season begins on November 6, 1983, in a small town called Hawkins. Researchers at Hawkins National Laboratory open a rift to the \"Upside Down,\" an alternate dimension that reflects the real world. A monstrous humanoid creature escapes and abducts a boy named Will Byers. Will's mother, Joyce, and the town's police chief, Jim Hopper, search for Will. At the same time, a young psychokinetic girl who goes by the name \"Eleven,\" nicknamed by Mike as \"El,\" escapes from the laboratory and assists Will's friends, Mike Wheeler, Dustin Henderson, and Lucas Sinclair, in their efforts to find Will.\n\n**Cast and Characters**\n\nStranger Things was created by Matt and Ross Duffer, known professionally as the Duffer Brothers. The two had completed writing and producing their 2015 film Hidden, which they had tried to emulate the style of M Night Shyamalan. To their surprise, television producer Donald De Line approached them, impressed with Hidden's script, and offered them the opportunity to work on episodes of Wayward Pines alongside Shyamalan. The brothers were mentored by Shyamalan during the episode's production, so when they finished, they felt they were ready to produce their own television series.\n\n**Main Cast**\n\nThe main cast of the first season includes Winona Ryder as Joyce Byers, David Harbour as Jim Hopper, Finn Wolfhard as Mike Wheeler, Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven, Gaten Matarazzo as Dustin Henderson, Caleb McLaughlin as Lucas Sinclair, and Noah Schnapp as Will Byers.\n\n**Recurring**\n\nThe recurring cast includes Natalia Dyer as Nancy Wheeler, Charlie Heaton as Jonathan Byers, and Joe Keery as Steve Harrington.\n\n**Episodes**\n\nThe first season consists of eight episodes, each approximately 60 minutes long. The episodes are titled: \"The Vanishing of Will Byers,\" \"The Weirdo on Maple Street,\" \"Holly, Jolly,\" \"The Body,\" \"The Flea and the Acrobat,\" \"The Monster,\" \"The Bathtub,\" and \"The Upside Down.\"\n\n**Production**\n\nThe brothers had desired to film the series around the Long Island area to match the initial Montauk concept. However, with filming scheduled to take place in November 2015, it was difficult to shoot in Long Island in the cold weather, and the production started scouting locations in and around the Atlanta, Georgia area. The brothers, who grew up in North Carolina, found many places that reminded them of their own childhoods in that area, and felt the area would work well with the narrative shift to the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana.\n\n**Visual Effects**\n\nTo create the aged effect for the series, a film grain was added over the footage, which was captured by scanning in film stock from the 1980s. The Duffers wanted to scare the audience, but not to necessarily make the show violent or gory, following in line with how the 1980s Amblin Entertainment films drove the creation of the PG-13 movie rating. The brothers had wanted to avoid any computer-generated effects for the monster and other parts of the series and stay with practical effects. However, the six-month filming time left them little time to plan out and test practical effects rigs for some of the shots.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe Stranger Things original soundtrack was composed by Michael Stein and Kyle Dixon of the electronic band Survive. It makes extensive use of synthesizers in homage to 1980s artists and film composers, including Jean-Michel Jarre, Tangerine Dream, Vangelis, Goblin, John Carpenter, Giorgio Moroder, and Fabio Frizzi.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe first season of Stranger Things was released on Netflix on July 15, 2016, in Ultra HD 4K and HDR. The season was a huge success, and it received widespread critical acclaim.\n\n**Home Media**\n\nThe first season of Stranger Things was released on a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack exclusively to Target retailers on October 17, 2017, and the same for the 4K/Blu-ray combo pack on November 15, 2017, both of which includes vintage CBS-FOX VHS-inspired packaging.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe first season of Stranger Things received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising its nostalgic value, engaging storyline, and strong performances from the cast. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the first season an approval rating of 97% based on 92 reviews and a weighted average score of 8.2/10.

The season's portrayal of the 1980s, including the music, fashion, and technology, has been widely praised. The season's use of practical effects has also been praised, and it has inspired a new generation of filmmakers to use practical effects in their work. The season's strong performances from the cast, particularly Millie Bobby Brown, have also been widely praised.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nThe first season of Stranger Things has received several awards and nominations, including four Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series and Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series. The season has also won several awards, including the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series.\n\nOverall, the first season of Stranger Things was a huge success, and it received widespread critical acclaim for its engaging storyline, strong performances from the cast, and nostalgic value.

brothers were mentored by Shyamalan during the episode's production so that when they finished, they felt they were ready to produce their own television series [15]\n\n\nWriting\nThe idea of Stranger Things started with how the brothers felt they could take the concept of the 2013 film Prisoners, detailing the moral struggles a father goes through when his daughter is kidnapped, and expand it out over eight or so hours in a serialized television approach As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of \"childlike sensibilities\" they could offer and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans The brothers thought the combination of these things \"was the best thing ever\" To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered \"bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War\" such as Project MKUltra, which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual This also helped them to decide on using 1983 as the time period, as it was a year before the film Red Dawn came out, which focused on Cold War paranoia [15] Subsequently, they were able to use all their own personal inspirations from the 1980s, the decade they were born, as elements of the series, [15] [23] crafting it in the realm of science fiction and horror [24] The Duffer Brothers have cited as influence for the show (among others): Stephen King novels; films produced by Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter, Wes Craven, Robert Zemeckis, George Lucas and Guillermo del Toro; films such as Alien and Stand by Me; Japanese anime such as Akira and Elfen Lied; and video games such as Silent Hill and The Last of Us [22] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32]\n\n\nCasting\nIn June 2015, it was announced that Winona Ryder and David Harbour had joined the series as Joyce and as the unnamed chief of police, respectively [3] The brothers' casting director Carmen Cuba had suggested Ryder for the role of Joyce, which the two were immediately drawn to because of her prominence in 1980s film [15] Levy believed Ryder could \"wretch up the emotional urgency and yet find layers and nuance and different sides of  [Joyce]\" Ryder praised that the show's multiple storylines required her to act for Joyce as \"she's out of her mind, but she's actually kind of onto something\", and that the producers had faith she could pull off the difficult role [36] The Duffer Brothers had been interested in Harbour before, who until Stranger Things primarily had smaller roles as villainous characters, and they felt that he had been \"waiting too long for this opportunity\" to play a lead, while Harbour himself was thrilled by the script and the chance to play \"a broken, flawed, anti-hero character\" [22] [37]\n\n\nFilming\nThe brothers had desired to film the series around the Long Island area to match the initial Montauk concept However, with filming scheduled to take place in November 2015, it was difficult to shoot in Long Island in the cold weather, and the production started scouting locations in and around the Atlanta, Georgia area The brothers, who grew up in North

more about mood and atmosphere and suspense and dread than they are about gore\", though they were not afraid to push into more scary elements, particularly towards the end of the first season [34] The brothers had wanted to avoid any computer-generated effects for the monster and other parts of the series and stay with practical effects However, the six-month filming time left them little time to plan out and test practical effects rigs for some of the shots They went with a middle ground of using constructed props including one for the monster whenever they could, but for other shots, such as when the monster bursts through a wall, they opted to use digital effects Post-production on the first season was completed the week before it was released on Netflix [15]\n\n\nMusic\nThe Stranger

Her innovative work in the 20th century paved the way for the development of sustainable energy solutions, earning her the nickname \"Sun Queen.\"\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nMária Telkes was born in 1900 in Budapest, Hungary, to Aladár and Mária (née Lábán) de Telkes. Her grandfather, Simon Telkes, was from a Jewish family, and in 1881, her father, Aladár, magyarized the family name to Telkes. In 1883, he converted to the Unitarian faith, and in 1907, he was elevated to the Hungarian nobility with the prefix kelenföldi.\n\nTelkes's early life and education were marked by a strong interest in science and technology. She attended the University of Budapest, where she studied physics and mathematics, and later earned her Ph.D. in physics from the University of Budapest in 1924.\n\n**Career**\n\nIn 1924, Telkes moved to the United States, where she visited a relative who was the Hungarian consul in Cleveland, Ohio. There, she was hired to work at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation to investigate the energy produced by living organisms. Under the leadership of George Washington Crile, Telkes and her team invented a photoelectric mechanism that could record brain waves.\n\nTelkes's work at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation laid the foundation for her future research in solar energy. She continued to work on various projects, including the development of a solar-powered water desalination machine. During World War II, the United States government recruited Telkes to serve as a civilian advisor to the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD). There, she developed a solar-powered water desalination machine, completing a prototype in 1942.\n\n**Desalination**\n\nTelkes's work on the solar-powered water desalination machine was a significant breakthrough in the field of solar energy. The machine used a combination of solar panels and a desalination mechanism to produce fresh water from seawater. Telkes's machine was designed to be portable and efficient, making it an ideal solution for military and civilian applications.\n\nThe desalination machine was one of Telkes's most notable inventions, and it helped soldiers get clean water in difficult situations during World War II. After the war, the machine was deployed in the US Virgin Islands, where it helped to solve water problems in the region.\n\n**Heat Storage**\n\nTelkes identified thermal energy storage as the most critical problem facing designers of a workable solar-heated house. She specialized in phase-change materials that absorb or release heat when they change from solid to liquid. Telkes hoped to use phase-change materials like molten salts for storing thermal energy in active heating systems.\n\nTelkes's research on heat storage led to the development of a new type of solar-heated house. The house used a combination of solar panels and a heat storage system to provide a reliable source of heat. Telkes's design was innovative and efficient, making it an attractive solution for homeowners and builders.\n\n**Dover Sun House**\n\nIn 1948, Telkes started working on the Dover Sun House, a solar-heated house that she designed with architect Eleanor Raymond. The system was designed so that Glauber's salt would melt in the sun, trap the heat, and then release it as it cooled and hardened.\n\nThe Dover Sun House was a significant project for Telkes, and it marked a major milestone in her career. The house was designed to be energy-efficient and sustainable, making it an attractive solution for homeowners and builders.\n\n**Solar-Powered Oven**\n\nBy 1953, Telkes was working at the New York University College of Engineering, where she continued to conduct solar energy research. Telkes received a grant from the Ford Foundation to develop a solar-powered oven that could be used by people who lack access to modern technology.\n\nTelkes's solar-powered oven was designed to be simple, durable, and portable. The oven used a combination of solar panels and a heat-absorbing chemical to reach high temperatures. Telkes's design was innovative and efficient, making it an attractive solution for people around the world.\n\n**Awards, Accolades, and Legacy**\n\nTelkes was recognized many times for her work in the field of solar energy. She was awarded numerous patents for her inventions and was hailed as a pioneer in the field of solar energy.\n\nTelkes's legacy extends beyond her own work in solar energy. She paved the way for future generations of researchers and inventors who are working to develop sustainable energy solutions. Her contributions to the field of solar energy are a testament to her innovative spirit and dedication to advancing sustainable technologies.\n\n**Patents and Papers**\n\nTelkes's papers are in the collections of the Arizona State University Library, Design and the Arts Special Collections, in Tempe, Arizona.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of Mária Telkes's life and work.

The club was founded in 1871, making it one of the oldest football clubs in England. Throughout its history, Southall has had a significant impact on the sport, producing several talented players who have gone on to play for top-tier clubs and represent their country.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\nSouthall F.C. was founded in 1871, making it one of the oldest football clubs in England. Two seasons later, the club entered the FA Cup, which was then in its infancy. The club's early years were marked by modest success, with several promotions and relegations in the regional leagues. However, it wasn't until the 1980s that Southall began to make a name for itself in the football world.\n\nIn the 1980s, Southall F.C. enjoyed a period of sustained success, winning several regional cups and promotions. The club's success during this period was largely due to the talents of its players, many of whom went on to play for top-tier clubs. Les Ferdinand, who played for Southall from 1980 to 1983, is perhaps the most notable example of a player who rose through the ranks at the club. Ferdinand's impressive performances for Southall caught the attention of top clubs, and he eventually signed for Queens Park Rangers.\n\nGround\n-------\n\nSouthall F.C. currently plays its home games at The 1878 Stadium in Burnham, where it shares the ground with Burnham F.C. The club previously played its home fixtures at the Robert Parker Stadium in Stanwell, where it shared the ground with Ashford Town (Middlesex). The Robert Parker Stadium was a prominent venue in the region, hosting several high-profile matches.\n\nIn the Media\n------------\n\nAhead of Southall's 1986 FA Vase final against Halesowen Town, Thames News televised a preview for the final, interviewing the team's manager Gordon Bartlett at the club's Western Road ground. The piece showed footage of former Southall players Alan Devonshire and Les Ferdinand, who at the time was Southall's leading goalscorer.\n\nHonours & Achievements\n----------------------\n\nSouthall F.C. has won several regional cups and promotions throughout its history. The club's most notable achievement was its promotion to the Southern League in 1986. However, the club's successes have been largely overshadowed by its financial struggles, which have forced it to sell its ground and relocate several times.\n\nRecords\n-------\n\nNotable former Southall players include Les Ferdinand MBE (QPR, Tottenham, Newcastle, and England), Alan Devonshire (West Ham and England), Gordon Hill (Manchester United and Millwall), Justin Fashanu (Norwich),

in Bose's thought, all means were acceptable in the service of anti-colonial ends [78] They differed on the question of ends—Bose was attracted to totalitarian models of governance, which were anathematized by Gandhi [79] According to historian Gordon, \"Gandhi, however, set Bose on to the leader of the Congress and Indian nationalism in Bengal, C R Das, and in him Bose found the leader whom he sought.\" [78] Das was more flexible than Gandhi, more sympathetic to the extremism that had attracted idealistic young men such as Bose in Bengal [78] Das launched Bose into nationalist politics [78] Bose would work within the ambit of the Indian National Congress politics for nearly 20 years even as he tried to change its course [78]\n\n\n1933–1937: Illness, Austria, Emilie Schenkl\nDuring the mid-1930s Bose travelled in Europe, visiting Indian students and European politicians, including Benito Mussolini He observed party organisation and saw communism and fascism in action [86] In this period, he also researched and wrote the first part of his book The Indian Struggle, which covered the country's independence movement in the years 1920–1934 Although it was published in London in 1935, the British government banned the book in the colony out of fears that it would encourage unrest [87] Bose was supported in Europe by the Indian Central European Society organized by Otto Faltis from Vienna [88]\n\n\n1937–1940: Indian National Congress\nIn 1938 Bose stated his opinion that the INC \"should be organised on the broadest anti-imperialist front with the two-fold objective of winning political freedom and the establishment of a socialist regime.\" [89] By 1938 Bose had become a leader of national stature and agreed to accept nomination as Congress President He stood for unqualified Swaraj (self-governance), including the use of force against the British This meant a confrontation with Mohandas Gandhi, who in fact opposed Bose's presidency, [90] splitting the Indian National Congress party.\n\n\n1941: Escape to Nazi Germany\nBose's arrest and subsequent release set the scene for his escape to Nazi Germany, via Afghanistan and the Soviet Union A few days before his escape, he sought solitude and, on this pretext, avoided meeting British guards and grew a beard Late night 16 January 1941, the night of his escape, he dressed as a Pathan (brown long coat, a black fez-type coat and broad pyjamas) to avoid being identified Bose escaped from under British surveillance from his Elgin Roadhouse in Calcutta on the night of 17 January 1941, accompanied by his nephew Sisir Kumar Bose, later reaching Gomoh Railway Station (now Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Gomoh Station) in the then state of Bihar (now Jharkhand), India [98] [99] [100] [101]\n\n\n1941–1943: Collaboration with Nazi Germany\nIn Germany, Bose was attached to the Special Bureau for India under Adam von Trott zu Solz which was responsible for broadcasting on the German-sponsored Azad Hind Radio [105] He founded the Free India Center in Berlin and created the Indian Legion (consisting of some 4500 soldiers) out of Indian prisoners of war who had previously fought for the British in North Africa prior to their capture by Axis forces The Indian Legion was attached to the Wehrmacht, and later transferred to the Waffen SS Its members swore the following allegiance to Hitler and Bose: \"I swear by God this holy oath that I will obey the leader of the German race and state, Adolf Hitler, as the commander of the German armed forces in the fight for India, whose leader is Subhas Chandra Bose\" This oath clearly abrogated control of the Indian legion to the German armed forces whilst stating Bose's overall leadership of India He was also, however, prepared to envisage an invasion of India via the USSR by Nazi troops, spearheaded by the Azad Hind Legion;

Born on January 23, 1897, in what is now the state of Odisha, India, Bose was the ninth child of Prabhabati Bose and Janakinath Bose. He would go on to become a leader in the Indian National Congress and the Indian National Army, and his legacy continues to be celebrated in India and beyond.\n\n## Biography\n\nSubhas Chandra Bose was born to Bengali parents Prabhabati Bose (née Dutt) and Janakinath Bose on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, which was part of the Bengal Presidency in British India. Prabhabati, or \"Mā jananī\" (lit. \"mother\"), had her first child at the age of 14 and went on to have 13 more children. Subhas was the ninth child and the sixth son. Janakinath, a successful lawyer and government pleader, was loyal to the government of British India and scrupulous about matters of language and the law. He had remained in touch with his roots, returning annually to his village during the pooja holidays.\n\n## 1897-1921: Early Life\n\nSubhas Chandra Bose was born to Bengali parents Prabhabati Bose (née Dutt) and Janakinath Bose on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, which was part of the Bengal Presidency in British India. Prabhabati, or \"Mā jananī\" (lit. \"mother\"), had her first child at the age of 14 and went on to have 13 more children. Subhas was the ninth child and the sixth son. Janakinath, a successful lawyer and government pleader, was loyal to the government of British India and scrupulous about matters of language and the law. He had remained in touch with his roots, returning annually to his village during the pooja holidays.\n\n## 1921-1932: Indian National Congress\n\nSubhas Bose, aged 24, arrived ashore in India at Bombay on July 16, 1921, and immediately set about arranging an interview with Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi, aged 51, was the leader of the non-cooperation movement that had taken India by storm the previous year. In Bose's account of the meeting, written many years later, he pilloried Gandhi with question after question. Bose thought Gandhi's answers were vague, his goals unclear, his plan for achieving them not thought through. Gandhi and Bose differed in this first meeting on the question of means – for Gandhi, non-violent means to any end were non-negotiable; in Bose's thought, all means were acceptable in the service of anti-colonial ends. They differed on the question of ends – Bose was attracted to totalitarian models of governance, which were anathematized by Gandhi. According to historian Gordon, \"Gandhi, however, set Bose on to the leader of the Congress and Indian nationalism in Bengal, C R Das, and in him Bose found the leader whom he sought.\" Das was more flexible than Gandhi, more sympathetic to the extremism that had attracted idealistic young men such as Bose in Bengal. Das launched Bose into nationalist politics. Bose would work within the ambit of the Indian National Congress politics for nearly 20 years, even as he tried to change its course.\n\n## 1933-1937: Illness, Austria, Emilie Schenkl\n\nDuring the mid-1930s, Bose traveled in Europe, visiting Indian students and European politicians, including Benito Mussolini. He observed party organization and saw communism and fascism in action. In this period, he also researched and wrote the first part of his book, The Indian Struggle, which covered the country's independence movement in the years 1920-1934. Although it was published in London in 1935, the British government banned the book in the colony out of fears that it would encourage unrest. Bose was supported in Europe by the Indian Central European Society organized by Otto Faltis from Vienna.\n\n## 1937-1940: Indian National Congress\n\nIn 1938, Bose stated his opinion that the INC \"should be organized on the broadest anti-imperialist front with the two-fold objective of winning political freedom and the establishment of a socialist regime.\" By 1938, Bose had become a leader of national stature and agreed to accept nomination as Congress President. He stood for unqualified Swaraj (self-governance), including the use of force against the British. This meant a confrontation with Mohandas Gandhi, who in fact opposed Bose's presidency, splitting the Indian National Congress party.\n\n## 1941: Escape to Nazi Germany\n\nBose's arrest and subsequent release set the scene for his escape to Nazi Germany, via Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. A few days before his escape, he sought solitude and, on this pretext, avoided meeting British guards and grew a beard. Late night, January 16, 1941, the night of his escape, he dressed as a Pathan (brown long coat, a black fez-type coat, and broad pyjamas) to avoid being identified. Bose escaped from under British surveillance from his Elgin Roadhouse in Calcutta on the night of January 17, 1941, accompanied by his nephew Sisir Kumar Bose, later reaching Gomoh Railway Station (now Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Gomoh Station) in the then-state of Bihar (now Jharkhand), India.\n\n## 1941-1943: Collaboration with Nazi Germany\n\nIn Germany, Bose was attached to the Special Bureau for India under Adam von Trott zu Solz, which was responsible for broadcasting on the German-sponsored Azad Hind Radio. He founded the Free India Center in Berlin and created the Indian Legion (consisting of some 4,500 soldiers) out of Indian prisoners of war who had previously fought for the British in North Africa prior to their capture by Axis forces. The Indian Legion was attached to the Wehrmacht, and later transferred to the Waffen SS. Its members swore the following allegiance to Hitler and Bose: \"I swear by God this holy oath that I will obey the leader of the German race and state, Adolf Hitler, as the commander of the German armed forces in the fight for India, whose leader is Subhas Chandra Bose.\" This oath clearly abrogated control of the Indian legion to the German armed forces while stating Bose's overall leadership of India. He was also prepared to envisage an invasion of India via the USSR by Nazi troops, spearheaded by the Azad Hind Legion; many have questioned his judgment here, as it seems unlikely that the Germans could have been easily persuaded to leave after such an invasion, which might also have resulted in an Axis victory in the War.\n\n## 1943-1945: Japanese-occupied Asia\n\nIn 1943, after being disillusioned that Germany could be of any help in gaining India's independence, Bose left for Japan. He traveled with the German submarine U-180 around the Cape of Good Hope to the southeast of Madagascar, where he was transferred to the I-29 for the rest of the journey to Imperial Japan. This was the only civilian transfer between two submarines of two different navies in World War II.\n\n## 18 August 1945: Death\n\nSubhas Chandra Bose died on August 18, 1945, from third-degree burns after his airplane crashed in Japanese-ruled Formosa (now Taiwan). However, many among his supporters, especially in Bengal, refused at the time, and have refused since, to believe either the fact or the circumstances of his death. Conspiracy theories appeared within hours of his death and have thereafter had a long shelf life, keeping alive various martial myths about Bose.\n\n## Ideology\n\nSubhas Chandra Bose believed that the Bhagavad Gita was a great source of inspiration for the struggle against the British. Swami Vivekananda's teachings on universalism, his nationalist thoughts, and his emphasis on social service and reform had all inspired Subhas Chandra Bose from his very young days. The fresh interpretation of India's ancient scriptures had appealed immensely to him. Some scholars think that Hindu spirituality formed an essential part of his political and social thought. As historian Leonard Gordon explains, \"Inner religious explorations continued to be a part of his adult life. This set him apart from the slowly growing number of atheistic socialists and communists who dotted the Indian landscape.\"\n\n## Authoritarianism\n\nBose believed that authoritarianism could bring liberation and reconstruction of Indian society. He expressed admiration for the authoritarian methods which he saw in Italy and Germany during the 1930s; he thought they could be used to build an independent India.\n\n## Anti-Semitism\n\nSince before the beginning of the World War II, Bose was opposed to the attempts to grant Jewish refugees asylum in India. The great anti-Jewish pogrom called \"the Night of Broken Glass\" happened on November 9, 1938. In early December, the pro-Hindu Mahasabha journals published articles lending support to German anti-Semitism. This stance brought Hindu Mahasabha into conflict with the Congress, which, on December 12, issued a statement containing references to recent European events. Within the Congress, only Bose opposed this stance of the party. After some months, in April 1939, Bose refused to support the party motion that Jews can find refuge in India.\n\n## Quotes\n\nHis most famous quote was \"Give me blood and I will give you freedom.\" Another famous quote was \"Dilli Chalo (\"On to Delhi)!\" This was the call he used to give the INA armies to motivate them. Another slogan coined by him was \"Ittehad, Etemad, Qurbani\" (Urdu for \"Unity, Agreement, Sacrifice\").\n\n## Legacy\n\nBose's defiance of British authority in India made him a hero among many Indians, however, his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a legacy fraught with authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and military failure.\n\n## Memorials\n\nBose was featured on the stamps in India from 1964, 1993, 1997, 2001, 2016, 2018, and 2021.

in Bose's thought, all means were acceptable in the service of anti-colonial ends [78] They differed on the question of ends—Bose was attracted to totalitarian models of governance, which were anathematized by Gandhi [79] According to historian Gordon, \"Gandhi, however, set Bose on to the leader of the Congress and Indian nationalism in Bengal, C R Das, and in him Bose found the leader whom he sought.\" [78] Das was more flexible than Gandhi, more sympathetic to the extremism that had attracted idealistic young men such as Bose in Bengal [78] Das launched Bose into nationalist politics [78] Bose would work within the ambit of the Indian National Congress politics for nearly 20 years even as he tried to change its course [78]\n\n\n1933–1937: Illness, Austria, Emilie Schenkl\nDuring the mid-1930s Bose travelled in Europe, visiting Indian students and European politicians, including Benito Mussolini He observed party organisation and saw communism and fascism in action [86] In this period, he also researched and wrote the first part of his book The Indian Struggle, which covered the country's independence movement in the years 1920–1934 Although it was published in London in 1935, the British government banned the book in the colony out of fears that it would encourage unrest [87] Bose was supported in Europe by the Indian Central European Society organized by Otto Faltis from Vienna [88]\n\n\n1937–1940: Indian National Congress\nIn 1938 Bose stated his opinion that the INC \"should be organised on the broadest anti-imperialist front with the two-fold objective of winning political freedom and the establishment of a socialist regime.\" [89] By 1938 Bose had become a leader of national stature and agreed to accept nomination as Congress President He stood for unqualified Swaraj (self-governance), including the use of force against the British This meant a confrontation with Mohandas Gandhi, who in fact opposed Bose's presidency, [90] splitting the Indian National Congress party.\n\n\n1941: Escape to Nazi Germany\nBose's arrest and subsequent release set the scene for his escape to Nazi Germany, via Afghanistan and the Soviet Union A few days before his escape, he sought solitude and, on this pretext, avoided meeting British guards and grew a beard Late night 16 January 1941, the night of his escape, he dressed as a Pathan (brown long coat, a black fez-type coat and broad pyjamas) to avoid being identified Bose escaped from under British surveillance from his Elgin Roadhouse in Calcutta on the night of 17 January 1941, accompanied by his nephew Sisir Kumar Bose, later reaching Gomoh Railway Station (now Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Gomoh Station) in the then state of Bihar (now Jharkhand), India [98] [99] [100] [101]\n\n\n1941–1943: Collaboration with Nazi Germany\nIn Germany, Bose was attached to the Special Bureau for India under Adam von Trott zu Solz which was responsible for broadcasting on the German-sponsored Azad Hind Radio [105] He founded the Free India Center in Berlin and created the Indian Legion (consisting of some 4500 soldiers) out of Indian prisoners of war who had previously fought for the British in North Africa prior to their capture by Axis forces The Indian Legion was attached to the Wehrmacht, and later transferred to the Waffen SS Its members swore the following allegiance to Hitler and Bose: \"I swear by God this holy oath that I will obey the leader of the German race and state, Adolf Hitler, as the commander of the German armed forces in the fight for India, whose leader is Subhas Chandra Bose\" This oath clearly abrogated control of the Indian legion to the German armed forces whilst stating Bose's overall leadership of India He was also, however, prepared to envisage an invasion of India via the USSR by Nazi troops, spearheaded by the Azad Hind Legion; many have questioned his judgment here, as it seems unlikely that the Germans could have been easily persuaded to leave after such an invasion, which might also have resulted in an Axis victory in the War [103]\n\n\n1943–1945: Japanese-occupied Asia\nIn 1943, after being disillusioned that Germany could be of any help in gaining India's independence, Bose left for Japan He travelled with the German submarine U-180 around the Cape of Good Hope to the southeast of Madagascar, where he was transferred to the I-29 for the rest of the journey to Imperial Japan This was the only civilian transfer between two submarines of two different navies in World War II [100] [101]\n\n\n18 August 1945: Death\nSubhas Chandra Bose died on 18 August 1945 from third-degree burns after his airplane crashed in Japanese-ruled Formosa (now Taiwan) [124] [36] [4] [5] However, many among his supporters, especially in Bengal, refused at the time, and have refused since, to believe either the fact or the circumstances of his death [124] [37] [38] Conspiracy theories appeared within hours of his death and have thereafter had a long shelf life, [124] [am] keeping alive various martial myths about Bose [44]\n\n\nIdeology\nSubhas Chandra Bose believed that the Bhagavad Gita was a great source of inspiration for the struggle against the British [136] Swami Vivekananda's teachings on universalism, his nationalist thoughts and his emphasis on social service and reform had all inspired Subhas Chandra Bose from his very young days The fresh interpretation of India's ancient scriptures had appealed immensely to him [137] Some scholars think that Hindu spirituality formed an essential part of his political and social thought [138] As historian Leonard Gordon explains \"Inner religious explorations continued to be a part of his adult life This set him apart from the slowly growing number of atheistic socialists and communists who dotted the Indian landscape.\" [139]\n\n\nAuthoritarianism\nBose believed that authoritarianism could bring liberation and reconstruction of Indian society [143] He expressed admiration for the authoritarian methods which he saw in Italy and Germany during the 1930s; he thought they could be used to build an independent India [96]\n\n\nAnti-semitism\nSince before the beginning of the World War II, Bose was opposed to the attempts to grant Jewish refugees asylum in India [149] [150] The great anti-Jewish pogrom called \"the Night of Broken Glass\" happened on 9 November 1938 In early December, the pro-Hindu Mahasabha journals published articles lending support to German anti-Semitism This stance brought Hindu Mahasabha into conflict with the Congress which, on 12 December, issued a statement containing references to recent European events Within the Congress, only Bose opposed this stance of the party After some months in April 1939, Bose refused to support the party motion that Jews can find refuge in India [49] [151] [152] [153] [154] [155]\n\n\nQuotes\nHis most famous quote was \"Give me blood and I will give you freedom\" [159] Another famous quote was Dilli Chalo (\"On to Delhi)!\" This was the call he used to give the INA armies to motivate them Another slogan coined by him was \"Ittehad, Etemad, Qurbani\" (Urdu for \"Unity, Agreement, Sacrifice\")  [160]\n\n\nLegacy\nBose' defiance of British authority in India made him a hero among many Indians, [ao] [ap] [aq] however his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a legacy fraught with authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and military failure [ar] [163] [164] [as] [at]\n\n\nMemorials\nBose was featured on the stamps in India from 1964, 1993, 1997, 2001, 2016, 2018 and 2021 [167] Bose was also featured in ₹2 coins in 1996 and 1997, ₹75 coin in 2018 and ₹125 coin in 2021 [168] [169] [170] Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport at Kolkata, West Bengal Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Gomoh railway station at Gomoh, Jharkhand Netaji Express, a train runs between Howrah, West Bengal and Kalka, Haryana Cuttack Netaji Bus Terminal at Cuttack, Odisha Netaji Bhavan metro station and Netaji metro station at Kolkata, West Bengal and Netaji Subhash Place metro station at Delhi Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Island at Andaman and Nicobar Island Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Setu (Longest bridge of Odisha) at Cuttack, Odisha Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Road at Kolkata, West Bengal INA War Museum at Moirang, Manipur Netaji Indoor Stadium at Kolkata, West Bengal, DDA Netaji Subhash Sports Complex at Delhi, Netaji Stadium at Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar Island Netaji Subhas Open University at Kolkata, West Bengal, Netaji Subhash University of Technology at Delhi, Netaji Subhas University at Jamshedpur, Jharkhand and many other things in India are named after him On 23 August 2007, Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzō Abe visited the Netaji Bhawan in Kolkata [171] [172] Abe, who is also the recipient of Netaji Award 2022, [173] said to Bose's family \"The Japanese are deeply moved by Bose's strong will to have led the Indian independence movement from British rule Netaji is a much respected name in Japan.\" [171] [172]\n\n\nIn popular media\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "North_Korea", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe modern spelling of Korea first appeared in 1671 in the travel writings of the Dutch East India Company's Hendrick Hamel [13]\n\n\nHistory\nAccording to Korean mythology in 2333 BCE, the Gojoseon Kingdom was established by the god-king Dangun Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under the name Unified Silla in 668 AD, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1897) In 1897, King Gojong proclaimed the Korean Empire, which was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910 [19]\n\n\nFounding\nAfter the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945, the Korean Peninsula was divided into two zones along the 38th parallel, with the northern half of the peninsula occupied by the Soviet Union and the southern half by the United States Negotiations on reunification failed Soviet general Terenty Shtykov recommended the establishment of the Soviet Civil Administration in October 1945, and supported Kim Il Sung as chairman of the Provisional People's Committee of North Korea, established in February 1946 In September 1946, South Korean citizens rose up against the Allied Military Government In April 1948, an uprising of the Jeju islanders was violently crushed The South declared its statehood in May 1948 and two months later the ardent anti-communist Syngman Rhee [28] became its ruler The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was established in the North on 9 September 1948 Shtykov served as the first Soviet ambassador, while Kim Il Sung became premier.\n\n\nKorean War\nThe military of North Korea invaded the South on 25 June 1950, and swiftly overran most of the country The United Nations Command (UNC) was subsequently established following the UN Security Council's recognition of North Korean aggression against South Korea The motion passed because the Soviet Union, a close ally of North Korea and a member of the UN Security Council, was boycotting the UN over its recognition of the Republic of China rather than the People's Republic of China [33] The UNC, led by the United States, intervened to defend the South, and rapidly advanced into North Korea As they neared the border with China, Chinese forces intervened on behalf of North Korea, shifting the balance of the war again Fighting ended on 27 July 1953, with an armistice that approximately restored the original boundaries between North and South Korea, but no peace treaty was signed [34] Approximately 3 million people died in the Korean War, with a higher proportional civilian death toll than World War II or the Vietnam War [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] In both per capita and absolute terms, North Korea was the country most devastated by the war, which resulted in the death of an estimated 12–15% of the North Korean population (c 10 million), \"a figure close to or surpassing the proportion of Soviet citizens killed in World War II,\" according to Charles K Armstrong [40] As a result of the war, almost every substantial building in North Korea was destroyed [41] [42] Some have referred to the conflict as a civil war, with other factors involved [43]\n\n\nPost-war developments\nThe post-war 1950s and 1960s saw an ideological shift in North Korea, as Kim Il Sung sought to consolidate his power Kim Il Sung was highly critical of Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev and his de-Stalinization policies and critiqued Khrushchev as revisionist [48] During the 1956 August Faction Incident, Kim Il Sung successfully resisted efforts by the Soviet Union and China to depose him in favor of Soviet Koreans or the pro-Chinese Yan'an faction [49] [50] Some scholars believe that the 1956 August incident was an example of North Korea demonstrating political independence [49] [50] [51] However, most scholars consider the final withdrawal of Chinese troops from North Korea in October 1958 to be the latest date when North Korea became effectively independent In the late 1950s and early 1960s, North Korea sought to distinguish itself internationally by becoming a leader of the Non-Aligned Movement and promoting the ideology of Juche [52] In United States policymaking, North Korea was considered among the Captive Nations [53] Despite its efforts to break out of the Soviet and Chinese spheres of influence, North Korea remained closely aligned with both countries throughout the Cold War [54]\n\n\nLeadership of Kim Jong Il\nThe Soviet Union was dissolved on 26 December 1991, ending its aid and support to North Korea In 1992, as Kim Il Sung's health began deteriorating, his son Kim Jong Il slowly began taking over various state tasks Kim Il Sung died of a heart attack in 1994; Kim Jong Il declared a three-year period of national mourning, afterward officially announcing his position as the new leader [62]\n\n\nLeadership of Kim Jong Un\nOn 17 December 2011, Kim Jong Il died from a heart attack His youngest son Kim Jong Un was announced as his successor [76] In the face of international condemnation, North Korea continued to develop its nuclear arsenal, possibly including a hydrogen bomb and a missile capable of reaching the United States [77]\n\n\nGeography\nNorth Korea occupies the northern portion of the Korean Peninsula, lying between latitudes 37° and 43°N, and longitudes 124° and 131°E It covers an area of 120,540 square kilometers (46,541 sq mi) [2] To its west are the Yellow Sea and Korea Bay, and to its east lies Japan across the Sea of Japan.\n\n\nClimate\nNorth Korea experiences a humid continental climate within the Köppen climate classification scheme Winters bring clear weather interspersed with snow storms as a result of northern and northwestern winds that blow from Siberia [93] Summer tends to be by far the hottest, most humid, and rainiest time of year because of the southern and southeastern monsoon winds that carry moist air from the Pacific Ocean Approximately 60 percent of all precipitation occurs from June to September [93] Spring and autumn are transitional seasons between summer and winter The daily average high and low temperatures for Pyongyang are −3 and −13 °C (27 and 9 °F) in January and 29 and 20 °C (84 and 68 °F) in August [93]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nNorth Korea functions as a highly centralized, one-party totalitarian dictatorship [94] [95] [96] [97] According to its constitution, it is a self-described revolutionary and socialist state \"guided in its building and activities only by great Kimilsungism–Kimjongilism\" [98] In addition to the constitution, North Korea is governed by the Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System (also known as the \"Ten Principles of the One-Ideology System\") which establishes standards for governance and a guide for the behaviors of North Koreans [99] The Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), a communist party led by a member of the Kim family, [100] [101] has an estimated 6.5 million members [102] and is in control of North Korean politics It has two satellite parties, the Korean Social Democratic Party and the Chondoist Chongu Party [103]\n\n\nPolitical ideology\nKimilsungism–Kimjongilism is the official ideology of North Korea and the WPK, and is the cornerstone of party works and government operations [98] Juche, part of the larger Kimilsungism–Kimjongilism along with Songun under Kim Jong Un, [130] is viewed by the official North Korean line as an embodiment of Kim Il Sung's wisdom, an expression of his leadership, and an idea which provides \"a complete answer to any question that arises in the struggle for national liberation\" [131] Juche was pronounced in December 1955 in a speech called On Eliminating Dogmatism and Formalism and Establishing Juche in Ideological Work in order to emphasize a Korea-centered revolution [131] Its core tenets are economic self-sufficiency, military self-reliance and an independent foreign policy The roots of Juche were made up of a complex mixture of factors, including the popularity of Kim Il Sung, the conflict with pro-Soviet and pro-Chinese dissenters, and Korea's centuries-long struggle for independence [132] Juche was introduced into the constitution in 1972 [133] [134]\n\n\nKim family\nSince the founding of the nation, North Korea's supreme leadership has stayed within the Kim family, which in North Korea is referred to as the Mount Paektu Bloodline It is a three-generation lineage descending from the country's first leader, Kim Il Sung, who developed North Korea around the Juche ideology, and stayed in power until his death [142] Kim developed a cult of personality closely tied to the state philosophy of Juche, which was later passed on to his successors: his son Kim Jong Il in 1994 and grandson Kim Jong Un in 2011 In 2013, Clause 2 of Article 10 of the newly edited Ten Fundamental Principles of the Workers' Party of Korea stated that the party and revolution must be carried \"eternally\" by the \"Mount Paektu Bloodline\" [143]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nAs a result of its isolation, North Korea is sometimes known as the \"hermit kingdom\", a term that originally referred to the isolationism in the latter part of the Joseon Dynasty [157] Initially, North Korea had diplomatic ties only with other communist countries, and even today, most of the foreign embassies accredited to North Korea are located in Beijing rather than in Pyongyang [158] In the 1960s and 1970s, it pursued an independent foreign policy, established relations with many developing countries, and joined the Non-Aligned Movement In the late 1980s and the 1990s its foreign policy was thrown into turmoil with the collapse of the Soviet Bloc Suffering an economic crisis, it closed a number of its embassies At the same time, North Korea sought to build relations with developed free market countries [159]\n\n\nForeign relations\nAs a result of its isolation, North Korea is sometimes known as the \"hermit kingdom\", a term that originally referred to the isolationism in the latter part of the Joseon Dynasty [157] Initially, North Korea had diplomatic ties only with other communist countries, and even today, most of the foreign embassies accredited to North Korea are located in Beijing rather than in Pyongyang

foreign policy was thrown into turmoil with the collapse of the Soviet Bloc Suffering an economic crisis, it closed a number of its embassies At the same time, North Korea sought to build relations with developed free market countries [159]\n\n\nSouth Korea\nThe Korean Demilitarized Zone with South Korea remains the most heavily fortified border in the world [183] [184] Inter-Korean relations are at the core of North Korean diplomacy and have seen numerous shifts in the last few decades North Korea's policy is to seek reunification without what it sees as outside interference, through a federal structure retaining each side's leadership and systems In 1972, the two Koreas agreed in principle to achieve reunification through peaceful means and without foreign interference [185] On 10 October 1980, the then North Korean leader Kim Il Sung proposed a federation between North and South Korea named the Democratic Federal Republic of Korea in which the respective political systems would initially remain [186] However, relations remained cool well until the early 1990s, with a brief period in the early 1980s when North Korea offered to provide flood relief to its southern neighbor [187] Although the offer was initially welcomed, talks over how to deliver the relief goods broke down and none of the promised aid ever crossed the border [188]\nThe two countries also organized a reunion of 92 separated families [189]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe North Korean armed forces, or the Korean People's Army (KPA), is estimated to comprise 1,280,000 active and 6,300,000 reserve and paramilitary troops, making it one of the largest military institutions in the world [205] With an active duty army consisting of 4.9% of its population, North Korea maintains the fourth largest active military force in the world behind China, India and the United States [206] About 20 percent of men aged 17–54 serve in the regular armed forces, [206] and approximately one in every 25 citizens is an enlisted soldier [207] [208]\n\n\nLaw enforcement and internal security\nNorth Korea has a civil law system based on the Prussian model and influenced by Japanese traditions and communist legal theory [234] Judiciary procedures are handled by the Central Court (the highest court of appeal), provincial or special city-level courts, people's courts, and special courts People's courts are at the lowest level of the system and operate in cities, counties and urban districts, while different kinds of special courts handle cases related to military, railroad, or maritime matters [235]\n\n\nHuman rights\nThe state of human rights in North Korea has been widely condemned A 2014 UN inquiry into the DPRK's human rights record found evidence for \"systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations\" and stated that \"the gravity, scale and nature of these violations reveal a state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world\", [248] with Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch holding similar views [249] [250] [251] North Koreans have been referred to as \"some of the world's most brutalized people\" by Human Rights Watch, because of the severe restrictions placed on their political and economic freedoms [250] [251] The North Korean population is strictly managed by the state and all aspects of daily life are subordinated to party and state planning According to US government reports, employment is managed by the party on the basis of political reliability, and travel is tightly controlled by the Ministry of People's Security [252] The US State Department says that North Koreans do not have a choice in the jobs they work and are not free to change jobs at will [253]\n\n\nEconomy\nNorth Korea has maintained one of the most closed and centralized economies in the world since the 1940s [284] For several decades, it followed the Soviet pattern of five-year plans with the ultimate goal of achieving self-sufficiency Extensive Soviet and Chinese support allowed North Korea to rapidly recover from the Korean War and register very high growth rates Systematic inefficiency began to arise around 1960, when the economy shifted from the extensive to the intensive development stage The shortage of skilled labor, energy, arable land and transportation significantly impeded long-term growth and resulted in consistent failure to meet planning objectives [285] The major slowdown of the economy contrasted with South Korea, which surpassed the North in terms of absolute GDP and per capita income by the 1980s [286] North Korea declared the last seven-year plan unsuccessful in December 1993 and thereafter stopped announcing plans [287]\n\n\nTransportation\nTransport infrastructure in North Korea includes railways, highways, water and air routes, but rail transport is by far the most widespread North Korea has some 5,200 kilometers (3,200 mi) of railways mostly in standard gauge which carry 80% of annual passenger traffic and 86% of freight, but electricity shortages undermine their efficiency [328] Construction of a high-speed railway connecting Kaesong, Pyongyang and Sinuiju with speeds exceeding 200 kilometers per hour (120 mph) was approved in 2013 [329] [needs update] North Korea connects with the Trans-Siberian Railway through Rajin.\n\n\nEnergy\nNorth Korea's energy infrastructure is obsolete and in disrepair Power shortages are chronic and would not be alleviated even by electricity imports because the poorly maintained grid causes significant losses during transmission [339] [340] Coal accounts for 70% of primary energy production, followed by hydroelectric power with 17% [328] The government under Kim Jong Un has increased emphasis on renewable energy projects like wind farms, solar parks, solar heating and biomass [341] A set of legal regulations adopted in 2014 stressed the development of geothermal, wind and solar energy along with recycling and environmental conservation [341] [342] North Korea's long-term objective is to curb fossil fuel usage and reach an output of 5 million kilowatts from renewable sources by 2044, up from its current total of 430,000 kilowatts from all sources Wind power is projected to satisfy 15% of the country's total energy demand under this strategy [343]\n\n\nScience and technology\nR&D efforts are concentrated at the State Academy of Sciences, which runs 40 research institutes, 200 smaller research centers, a scientific equipment factory and six publishing houses [345] The government considers science and technology to be directly linked to economic development [346] [347] A five-year scientific plan emphasizing IT, biotechnology, nanotechnology, marine technology, and laser and plasma research was carried out in the early 2000s [346] A 2010 report by the South Korean Science and Technology Policy Institute identified polymer chemistry, single carbon materials, nanoscience, mathematics, software, nuclear technology and rocketry as potential areas of inter-Korean scientific cooperation North Korean institutes are strong in these fields of research, although their engineers require additional training, and laboratories need equipment upgrades [348]\n\n\nDemographics\nNorth Korea's population was 10.9 million in 1961 [366] With the exception of a small Chinese community and a few ethnic Japanese, North Korea's 25,971,909 [367] [368] people are ethnically homogeneous [369] Demographic experts in the 20th century estimated that the population would grow to 25.5 million by 2000 and 28 million by 2010, but this increase never occurred due to the North Korean famine [370] The famine began in 1995, lasted for three years, and resulted in the deaths of between 240,000 and 420,000 North Koreans [66]\n\n\nLanguage\nNorth Korea shares the Korean language with South Korea, although some dialectal differences exist within both Koreas [373] North Koreans refer to their Pyongan dialect as munhwaŏ (\"cultured language\") as opposed to the dialects of South Korea, especially the Seoul dialect or p'yojun'ŏ (\"standard language\"), which are viewed as decadent because of its use of loanwords from Chinese and European languages (particularly English) [382] [383] Words of Chinese, Manchu or Western origin have been eliminated from munhwa along with the usage of Chinese hancha characters [382] Written language uses only the Chosŏn'gŭl (Hangul) phonetic alphabet, developed under Sejong the Great (1418–1450) [384] [385]\n\n\nReligion\nNorth Korea is officially an atheist state [386] [387] Its constitution guarantees freedom of religion under Article 68, but this principle is limited by the requirement that religion may not be used as a pretext to harm the state, introduce foreign forces, or harm the existing social order [98] [388] Religious practice is therefore restricted, [389] [390] despite nominal constitutional protections [391] Proselytizing is also prohibited due to concerns about foreign influence The number of Christian churchgoers nonetheless more than doubled between the 1980s and the early 2000s due to the recruitment of Christians who previously worshipped privately or in small house churches [392] The Open Doors mission, a Protestant group based in the United States and founded during the Cold War era, claims the most severe persecution of Christians in the world occurs in North Korea [393]\n\n\nEducation\nThe 2008 census listed the entire population as literate [381] An 11-year free, compulsory cycle of primary and secondary education is provided in more than 27,000 nursery schools, 14,000 kindergartens, 4,800 four-year primary and 4,700 six-year secondary schools [373] 77% of males and 79% of females aged 30–34 have finished secondary school [381] An additional 300 universities and colleges offer higher education [373]\n\n\nHealth\nNorth Korea has a life expectancy of 72.3 years in 2019, according to HDR 2020 [405] While North Korea is classified as a low-income country, the structure of North Korea's causes of death (2013) is unlike that of other low-income countries [406] Instead, it is closer to worldwide averages, with non-communicable diseases—such as cardiovascular disease and cancers—accounting for 84 percent of the total deaths in 2016 [407]\n\n\nSongbun\nAccording to North Korean documents and refugee testimonies, [418] all North Koreans are sorted into groups according to their Songbun, an ascribed status system based on a citizen's assessed loyalty to the government Based on their own behavior and the political, social, and economic background of their family for three generations as well as behavior by relatives within that range, Songbun is allegedly used to determine whether an individual is trusted with responsibility or given certain opportunities [419]\n\n\nCulture\nDespite a historically strong Chinese influence, Korean culture has shaped its own unique identity [423] It came under attack during the Japanese rule from 1910 to 1945, when Japan enforced a cultural assimilation policy Koreans were forced to learn and speak Japanese, adopt the Japanese family name system and Shinto religion, and were forbidden to write or speak the Korean language in schools, businesses, or public places [424]\n\n\nArt\nVisual arts are generally produced in the aesthetic of socialist realism [429] North Korean painting combines the influence of Soviet and Japanese visual expression to instill a sentimental loyalty to the system [430] All artists in North Korea are required to join the Artists' Union, and the best among them can receive an official license to portray the leaders Portraits and sculptures depicting Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un are classed as \"Number One works\" [429]\n\n\nLiterature\nAll publishing houses are owned by the government or the WPK because they are considered an important tool for agitprop [434] The Workers' Party of Korea Publishing House is the most authoritative among them and publishes all works of Kim Il Sung, ideological education materials and party policy documents [435] The availability of foreign literature is limited, examples being North Korean editions of Indian, German, Chinese and Russian fairy tales, Tales from Shakespeare, some works of Bertolt Brecht and Erich Kästner, [430] and the Harry Potter series [436]\n\n\nMusic\nThe government emphasized optimistic folk-based tunes and revolutionary music throughout most of the 20th century [425] Ideological messages are conveyed through massive orchestral pieces like the \"Five Great Revolutionary Operas\" based on traditional Korean ch'angguk [437] Revolutionary operas differ from their Western counterparts by adding traditional instruments to the orchestra and avoiding recitative segments [440] Sea of Blood is the most widely performed of the Five Great Operas: since its premiere in 1971, it has been played over 1,500 times, [441] and its 2010 tour in China was a major success [440] Western classical music by Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky and other composers is performed both by the State Symphony Orchestra and student orchestras [442]\n\n\nMedia\nGovernment policies towards film are no different from those applied to other arts—motion pictures serve to fulfill the targets of \"social education\" Some of the most influential films are based on historic events (An Jung-geun shoots Itō Hirobumi) or folk tales (Hong Gildong) [437] Most movies have predictable propaganda story lines which make cinema an unpopular entertainment; viewers only see films that feature their favorite actors [448] Western productions are only available at private showings to high-ranking Party members, [449] although the 1997 film Titanic is frequently shown to university students as an example of Western culture [450] Access to foreign media products is available through smuggled DVDs and television or radio broadcasts in border areas [451] Western films like The Interview, Charlie's Angels, and the aforementioned Titanic are just a few films that have been smuggled across the borders of North Korea, allowing for access to the North Korean citizens [452] [453]\n\n\nCuisine\nKorean cuisine has evolved through centuries of social and political change Originating from ancient agricultural and nomadic traditions in southern Manchuria and the Korean Peninsula, it has gone through a complex interaction of the natural environment and different cultural trends [464] Rice dishes and kimchi are staple Korean food In a traditional meal, they accompany both side dishes (panch'an) and main courses like juk, pulgogi or noodles Soju liquor is the best-known traditional Korean spirit [465]\n\n\nSports\nMost schools have daily practice in association football, basketball, table tennis, gymnastics, boxing and others The DPR Korea League is popular inside the country and its games are often televised [448] The national football team, Chollima, competed in the FIFA World Cup in 2010, when it lost all three matches against Brazil, Portugal and Ivory Coast [470] Its 1966 appearance was much more successful, seeing a surprise 1–0 victory over Italy and a quarter final loss to Portugal by 3–5 [471] A national team represents the nation in international basketball competitions as well In December 2013, former American basketball professional Dennis Rodman visited North Korea to help train the national team after he developed a friendship with Kim Jong Un [472]\n\n\nSee also\n40°N 127°E﻿ / ﻿40°N

Peninsula in East Asia. It shares a border with South Korea to the south, China to the north, and Russia to the northeast. The country has a population of approximately 25 million people and a highly centralized, one-party totalitarian government. The capital city is Pyongyang, and the official language is Korean.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe modern spelling of Korea first appeared in 1671 in the travel writings of the Dutch East India Company's Hendrick Hamel.\n\nHistory\n\nAccording to Korean mythology, the Gojoseon Kingdom was established by the god-king Dangun in 2333 BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under the name Unified Silla in 668 CE, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1897). In 1897, King Gojong proclaimed the Korean Empire, which was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910.\n\nFounding\n\nAfter the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945, the Korean Peninsula was divided into two zones along the 38th parallel, with the northern half of the peninsula occupied by the Soviet Union and the southern half by the United States. Negotiations on reunification failed, and the Soviet general Terenty Shtykov recommended the establishment of the Soviet Civil Administration in October 1945. Kim Il Sung was appointed chairman of the Provisional People's Committee of North Korea in February 1946. In September 1946, South Korean citizens rose up against the Allied Military Government, and in April 1948, an uprising of the Jeju islanders was violently crushed. The South declared its statehood in May 1948, and two months later, the ardent anti-communist Syngman Rhee became its ruler. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was established in the North on 9 September 1948.\n\nKorean War\n\nThe military of North Korea invaded the South on 25 June 1950, and swiftly overran most of the country. The United Nations Command (UNC) was subsequently established following the UN Security Council's recognition of North Korean aggression against South Korea. The UNC, led by the United States, intervened to defend the South and rapidly advanced into North Korea. As they neared the border with China, Chinese forces intervened on behalf of North Korea, shifting the balance of the war again. Fighting ended on 27 July 1953, with an armistice that approximately restored the original boundaries between North and South Korea, but no peace treaty was signed.\n\nPost-war developments\n\nThe post-war 1950s and 1960s saw an ideological shift in North Korea, as Kim Il Sung sought to consolidate his power. Kim Il Sung was highly critical of Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev and his de-Stalinization policies and critiqued Khrushchev as revisionist. During the 1956 August Faction Incident, Kim Il Sung successfully resisted efforts by the Soviet Union and China to depose him in favor of Soviet Koreans or the pro-Chinese Yan'an faction. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, North Korea sought to distinguish itself internationally by becoming a leader of the Non-Aligned Movement and promoting the ideology of Juche.\n\nLeadership of Kim Jong Il\n\nThe Soviet Union was dissolved on 26 December 1991, ending its aid and support to North Korea. In 1992, as Kim Il Sung's health began deteriorating, his son Kim Jong Il slowly began taking over various state tasks. Kim Il Sung died of a heart attack in 1994; Kim Jong Il declared a three-year period of national mourning, afterward officially announcing his position as the new leader.\n\nLeadership of Kim Jong Un\n\nOn 17 December 2011, Kim Jong Il died from a heart attack. His youngest son Kim Jong Un was announced as his successor. In the face of international condemnation, North Korea continued to develop its nuclear arsenal, possibly including a hydrogen bomb and a missile capable of reaching the United States.\n\nGeography\n\nNorth Korea occupies the northern portion of the Korean Peninsula, lying between latitudes 37° and 43°N, and longitudes 124° and 131°E. It covers an area of 120,540 square kilometers (46,541 sq mi). To its west are the Yellow Sea and Korea Bay, and to its east lies Japan across the Sea of Japan.\n\nClimate\n\nNorth Korea experiences a humid continental climate within the Köppen climate classification scheme. Winters bring clear weather interspersed with snow storms as a result of northern and northwestern winds that blow from Siberia. Summer tends to be by far the hottest, most humid, and rainiest time of year because of the southern and southeastern monsoon winds that carry moist air from the Pacific Ocean.\n\nGovernment and politics\n\nNorth Korea functions as a highly centralized, one-party totalitarian dictatorship.

Juche, part of the larger Kimilsungism–Kimjongilism under Kim Jong Un, is viewed by the official North Korean line as an embodiment of Kim Il Sung's wisdom, an expression of his leadership, and an idea which provides \"a complete answer to any question that arises in the struggle for national liberation.\"\n\nKim family\n\nSince the founding of the nation, North Korea's supreme leadership has stayed within the Kim family, which in North Korea is referred to as the Mount Paektu Bloodline. It is a three-generation lineage descending from the country's first leader, Kim Il Sung, who developed North Korea around the Juche ideology, and stayed in power until his death.\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\nNorth Korea is divided into nine provinces: Chagang, North Hamgyong, North Hwanghae, Ryanggang, South Hamgyong, South Hwanghae, Yanggang, and the two special cities Pyongyang and Rason.\n\nForeign relations\n\nNorth Korea has a complex and often tense relationship with its neighbors and the international community. It has been referred to as the \"hermit kingdom\" due to its isolationist policies and limited engagement with the outside world.\n\nSouth Korea\n\nThe Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) with South Korea remains the most heavily fortified border in the world. Inter-Korean relations are at the core of North Korean diplomacy and have seen numerous shifts in the last few decades. North Korea's policy is to seek reunification without what it sees as outside interference, through a federal structure retaining each side's leadership and systems.\n\nMilitary\n\nThe North Korean armed forces, or the Korean People's Army (KPA), is estimated to comprise 1,280,000 active and 6,300,000 reserve and paramilitary troops, making it one of the largest military institutions in the world.

Systematic inefficiency began to arise around 1960, when the economy shifted from the extensive to the intensive development stage.\n\nTransportation\n\nTransport infrastructure in North Korea includes railways, highways, water, and air routes, but rail transport is by far the most widespread. North Korea has some 5,200 kilometers (3,200 mi) of railways mostly in standard gauge, which carry 80% of annual passenger traffic and 86% of freight.\n\nEnergy\n\nNorth Korea's energy infrastructure is obsolete and in disrepair. Power shortages are chronic and would not be alleviated even by electricity imports because the poorly maintained grid causes significant losses during transmission.\n\nScience and technology\n\nR&D efforts are concentrated at the State Academy of Sciences, which runs 40 research institutes, 200 smaller research centers, a scientific equipment factory, and six publishing houses. The government considers science and technology to be directly linked to economic development.\n\nDemographics\n\nNorth Korea's population was 10.9 million in 1961. With the exception of a small Chinese community and a few ethnic Japanese, North Korea's 25,971,909 people are ethnically homogeneous. Demographic experts in the 20th century estimated that the population would grow to 25.5 million by 2000 and 28 million by 2010, but this increase never occurred due to the North Korean famine.\n\nLanguage\n\nNorth Korea shares the Korean language with South Korea, although some dialectal differences exist within both Koreas. North Koreans refer to their Pyongan dialect as munhwaŏ (\"cultured language\") as opposed to the dialects of South Korea, especially the Seoul dialect or p'yojun'ŏ (\"standard language\"), which are viewed as decadent.\n\nReligion\n\nNorth Korea is officially an atheist state. Its constitution guarantees freedom of religion under Article 68, but this principle is limited by the requirement that religion may not be used as a pretext to harm the state, introduce foreign forces, or harm the existing social order.\n\nEducation\n\nThe 2008 census listed the entire population as literate. An 11-year free, compulsory cycle of primary and secondary education is provided in more than 27,000 nursery schools, 14,000 kindergartens, 4,800 four-year primary and 4,700 six-year secondary schools.\n\nHealth\n\nNorth Korea has a life expectancy of 72.3 years in 2019, according to HDR 2020. While North Korea is classified as a low-income country, the structure of North Korea's causes of death (2013) is unlike that of other low-income countries.\n\nSongbun\n\nAccording to North Korean documents and refugee testimonies, all North Koreans are sorted into groups according to their Songbun, an ascribed status system based on a citizen's assessed loyalty to the government.\n\nCulture\n\nDespite a historically strong Chinese influence, Korean culture has shaped its own unique identity. It came under attack during the Japanese rule from 1910 to 1945, when Japan enforced a cultural assimilation policy.\n\nArt\n\nVisual arts are generally produced in the aesthetic of socialist realism. North Korean painting combines the influence of Soviet and Japanese visual expression to instill a sentimental loyalty to the system.\n\nLiterature\n\nAll publishing houses are owned by the government or the WPK because they are considered an important tool for agitprop. The Workers' Party of Korea Publishing House is the most authoritative among them and publishes all works of Kim Il Sung, ideological education materials, and party policy documents.\n\nMusic\n\nThe government emphasized optimistic folk-based tunes and revolutionary music throughout most of the 20th century. Ideological messages are conveyed through massive orchestral pieces like the \"Five Great Revolutionary Operas\" based on traditional Korean ch'angguk.\n\nMedia\n\nGovernment policies towards film are no different from those applied to other arts – motion pictures serve to fulfill the targets of \"social education.\" Some of the most influential films are based on historic events or folk tales.\n\nCuisine\n\nKorean cuisine has evolved through centuries of social and political change. Originating from ancient agricultural and nomadic traditions in southern Manchuria and the Korean Peninsula, it has gone through a complex interaction of the natural environment and different cultural trends.\n\nSports\n\nMost schools have daily practice in association football, basketball, table tennis, gymnastics, boxing, and others. The DPR Korea League is popular inside the country and its games are often televised.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"North_Korea\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe modern spelling of Korea first appeared in 1671 in the travel writings of the Dutch East India Company's Hendrick Hamel [13]\n\n\nHistory\nAccording to Korean mythology in 2333 BCE, the Gojoseon Kingdom was established by the god-king Dangun Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under the name Unified Silla in 668 AD, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392–1897) In 1897, King Gojong proclaimed the Korean Empire, which was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910 [19]\n\n\nFounding\nAfter the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945, the Korean Peninsula was divided into two zones along the 38th parallel, with the northern half of the peninsula occupied by the Soviet Union and the southern half by the United States Negotiations on reunification failed Soviet general Terenty Shtykov recommended the establishment of the Soviet Civil Administration in October 1945, and supported Kim Il Sung as chairman of the Provisional People's Committee of North Korea, established in February 1946 In September 1946, South Korean citizens rose up against the Allied Military Government In April 1948, an uprising of the Jeju islanders was violently crushed The South declared its statehood in May 1948 and two months later the ardent anti-communist Syngman Rhee [28] became its ruler The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was established in the North on 9 September 1948 Shtykov served as the first Soviet ambassador, while Kim Il Sung became premier.\n\n\nKorean War\nThe military of North Korea invaded the South on 25 June 1950, and swiftly overran most of the country The United Nations Command (UNC) was subsequently established following the UN Security Council's recognition of North Korean aggression against South Korea The motion passed because the Soviet Union, a close ally of North Korea and a member of the UN Security Council, was boycotting the UN over its recognition of the Republic of China rather than the People's Republic of China [33] The UNC, led by the United States, intervened to defend the South, and rapidly advanced into North Korea As they neared the border with China, Chinese forces intervened on behalf of North Korea, shifting the balance of the war again Fighting ended on 27 July 1953, with an armistice that approximately restored the original boundaries between North and South Korea, but no peace treaty was signed [34] Approximately 3 million people died in the Korean War, with a higher proportional civilian death toll than World War II or the Vietnam War [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] In both per capita and absolute terms, North Korea was the country most devastated by the war, which resulted in the death of an estimated 12–15% of the North Korean population (c 10 million), \"a figure close to or surpassing the proportion of Soviet citizens killed in World War II,\" according to Charles K Armstrong [40] As a result of the war, almost every substantial building in North Korea was destroyed [41] [42] Some have referred to the conflict as a civil war, with other factors involved [43]\n\n\nPost-war developments\nThe post-war 1950s and 1960s saw an ideological shift in North Korea, as Kim Il Sung sought to consolidate his power Kim Il Sung was highly critical of Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev and his de-Stalinization policies and critiqued Khrushchev as revisionist [48] During the 1956 August Faction Incident, Kim Il Sung successfully resisted efforts by the Soviet Union and China to depose him in favor of Soviet Koreans or the pro-Chinese Yan'an faction [49] [50] Some scholars believe that the 1956 August incident was an example of North Korea demonstrating political independence [49] [50] [51] However, most scholars consider the final withdrawal of Chinese troops from North Korea in October 1958 to be the latest date when North Korea became effectively independent In the late 1950s and early 1960s, North Korea sought to distinguish itself internationally by becoming a leader of the Non-Aligned Movement and promoting the ideology of Juche [52] In United States policymaking, North Korea was considered among the Captive Nations [53] Despite its efforts to break out of the Soviet and Chinese spheres of influence, North Korea remained closely aligned with both countries throughout the Cold War [54]\n\n\nLeadership of Kim Jong Il\nThe Soviet Union was dissolved on 26 December 1991, ending its aid and support to North Korea In 1992, as Kim Il Sung's health began deteriorating, his son Kim Jong Il slowly began taking over various state tasks Kim Il Sung died of a heart attack in 1994; Kim Jong Il declared a three-year period of national mourning, afterward officially announcing his position as the new leader [62]\n\n\nLeadership of Kim Jong Un\nOn 17 December 2011, Kim Jong Il died from a heart attack His youngest son Kim Jong Un was announced as his successor [76] In the face of international condemnation, North Korea continued to develop its nuclear arsenal, possibly including a hydrogen bomb and a missile capable of reaching the United States [77]\n\n\nGeography\nNorth Korea occupies the northern portion of the Korean Peninsula, lying between latitudes 37° and 43°N, and longitudes 124° and 131°E It covers an area of 120,540 square kilometers (46,541 sq mi) [2] To its west are the Yellow Sea and Korea Bay, and to its east lies Japan across the Sea of Japan.\n\n\nClimate\nNorth Korea experiences a humid continental climate within the Köppen climate classification scheme Winters bring clear weather interspersed with snow storms as a result of northern and northwestern winds that blow from Siberia [93] Summer tends to be by far the hottest, most humid, and rainiest time of year because of the southern and southeastern monsoon winds that carry moist air from the Pacific Ocean Approximately 60 percent of all precipitation occurs from June to September [93] Spring and autumn are transitional seasons between summer and winter The daily average high and low temperatures for Pyongyang are −3 and −13 °C (27 and 9 °F) in January and 29 and 20 °C (84 and 68 °F) in August [93]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nNorth Korea functions as a highly centralized, one-party totalitarian dictatorship [94] [95] [96] [97] According to its constitution, it is a self-described revolutionary and socialist state \"guided in its building and activities only by great Kimilsungism–Kimjongilism\" [98] In addition to the constitution, North Korea is governed by the Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System (also known as the \"Ten Principles of the One-Ideology System\") which establishes standards for governance and a guide for the behaviors of North Koreans [99] The Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), a communist party led by a member of the Kim family, [100] [101] has an estimated 6.5 million members [102] and is in control of North Korean politics It has two satellite parties, the Korean Social Democratic Party and the Chondoist Chongu Party [103]\n\n\nPolitical ideology\nKimilsungism–Kimjongilism is the official ideology of North Korea and the WPK, and is the cornerstone of party works and government operations [98] Juche, part of the larger Kimilsungism–Kimjongilism along with Songun under Kim Jong Un, [130] is viewed by the official North Korean line as an embodiment of Kim Il Sung's wisdom, an expression of his leadership, and an idea which provides \"a complete answer to any question that arises in the struggle for national liberation\" [131] Juche was pronounced in December 1955 in a speech called On Eliminating Dogmatism and Formalism and Establishing Juche in Ideological Work in order to emphasize a Korea-centered revolution [131] Its core tenets are economic self-sufficiency, military self-reliance and an independent foreign policy The roots of Juche were made up of a complex mixture of factors, including the popularity of Kim Il Sung, the conflict with pro-Soviet and pro-Chinese dissenters, and Korea's centuries-long struggle for independence [132] Juche was introduced into the constitution in 1972 [133] [134]\n\n\nKim family\nSince the founding of the nation, North Korea's supreme leadership has stayed within the Kim family, which in North Korea is referred to as the Mount Paektu Bloodline It is a three-generation lineage descending from the country's first leader, Kim Il Sung, who developed North Korea around the Juche ideology, and stayed in power until his death [142] Kim developed a cult of personality closely tied to the state philosophy of Juche, which was later passed on to his successors: his son Kim Jong Il in 1994 and grandson Kim Jong Un in 2011 In 2013, Clause 2 of Article 10 of the newly edited Ten Fundamental Principles of the Workers' Party of Korea stated that the party and revolution must be carried \"eternally\" by the \"Mount Paektu Bloodline\" [143]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nAs a result of its isolation, North Korea is sometimes known as the \"hermit kingdom\", a term that originally referred to the isolationism in the latter part of the Joseon Dynasty [157] Initially, North Korea had diplomatic ties only with other communist countries, and even today, most of the foreign embassies accredited to North Korea are located in Beijing rather than in Pyongyang [158] In the 1960s and 1970s, it pursued an independent foreign policy, established relations with many developing countries, and joined the Non-Aligned Movement In the late 1980s and the 1990s its foreign policy was thrown into turmoil with the collapse of the Soviet Bloc Suffering an economic crisis, it closed a number of its embassies At the same time, North Korea sought to build relations with developed free market countries [159]\n\n\nForeign relations\nAs a result of its isolation, North Korea is sometimes known as the \"hermit kingdom\", a term that originally referred to the isolationism in the latter part of the Joseon Dynasty [157] Initially, North Korea had diplomatic ties only with other communist countries, and even today, most of the foreign embassies accredited to North Korea are located in Beijing rather than in Pyongyang [158] In the 1960s and 1970s, it pursued an independent foreign policy, established relations with many developing countries, and joined the Non-Aligned Movement In the late 1980s and the 1990s its foreign policy was thrown into turmoil with the collapse of the Soviet Bloc Suffering an economic crisis, it closed a number of its embassies At the same time, North Korea sought to build relations with developed free market countries [159]\n\n\nSouth Korea\nThe Korean Demilitarized Zone with South Korea remains the most heavily fortified border in the world [183] [184] Inter-Korean relations are at the core of North Korean diplomacy and have seen numerous shifts in the last few decades North Korea's policy is to seek reunification without what it sees as outside interference, through a federal structure retaining each side's leadership and systems In 1972, the two Koreas agreed in principle to achieve reunification through peaceful means and without foreign interference [185] On 10 October 1980, the then North Korean leader Kim Il Sung proposed a federation between North and South Korea named the Democratic Federal Republic of Korea in which the respective political systems would initially remain [186] However, relations remained cool well until the early 1990s, with a brief period in the early 1980s when North Korea offered to provide flood relief to its southern neighbor [187] Although the offer was initially welcomed, talks over how to deliver the relief goods broke down and none of the promised aid ever crossed the border [188]\nThe two countries also organized a reunion of 92 separated families [189]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe North Korean armed forces, or the Korean People's Army (KPA), is estimated to comprise 1,280,000 active and 6,300,000 reserve and paramilitary troops, making it one of the largest military institutions in the world [205] With an active duty army consisting of 4.9% of its population, North Korea maintains the fourth largest active military force in the world behind China, India and the United States [206] About 20 percent of men aged 17–54 serve in the regular armed forces, [206] and approximately one in every 25 citizens is an enlisted soldier [207] [208]\n\n\nLaw enforcement and internal security\nNorth Korea has a civil law system based on the Prussian model and influenced by Japanese traditions and communist legal theory [234] Judiciary procedures are handled by the Central Court (the highest court of appeal), provincial or special city-level courts, people's courts, and special courts People's courts are at the lowest level of the system and operate in cities, counties and urban districts, while different kinds of special courts handle cases related to military, railroad, or maritime matters [235]\n\n\nHuman rights\nThe state of human rights in North Korea has been widely condemned A 2014 UN inquiry into the DPRK's human rights record found evidence for \"systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations\" and stated that \"the gravity, scale and nature of these violations reveal a state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world\", [248] with Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch holding similar views [249] [250] [251] North Koreans have been referred to as \"some of the world's most brutalized people\" by Human Rights Watch, because of the severe restrictions placed on their political and economic freedoms [250] [251] The North Korean population is strictly managed by the state and all aspects of daily life are subordinated to party and state planning According to US government reports, employment is managed by the party on the basis of political reliability, and travel is tightly controlled by the Ministry of People's Security [252] The US State Department says that North Koreans do not have a choice in the jobs they work and are not free to change jobs at will [253]\n\n\nEconomy\nNorth Korea has maintained one of the most closed and centralized economies in the world since the 1940s [284] For several decades, it followed the Soviet pattern of five-year plans with the ultimate goal of achieving self-sufficiency Extensive Soviet and Chinese support allowed North Korea to rapidly recover from the Korean War and register very high growth rates Systematic inefficiency began to arise around 1960, when the economy shifted from the extensive to the intensive development stage The shortage of skilled labor, energy, arable land and transportation significantly impeded long-term growth and resulted in consistent failure to meet planning objectives [285] The major slowdown of the economy contrasted with South Korea, which surpassed the North in terms of absolute GDP and per capita income by the 1980s [286] North Korea declared the last seven-year plan unsuccessful in December 1993 and thereafter stopped announcing plans [287]\n\n\nTransportation\nTransport infrastructure in North Korea includes railways, highways, water and air routes, but rail transport is by far the most widespread North Korea has some 5,200 kilometers (3,200 mi) of railways mostly in standard gauge which carry 80% of annual passenger traffic and 86% of freight, but electricity shortages undermine their efficiency [328] Construction of a high-speed railway connecting Kaesong, Pyongyang and Sinuiju with speeds exceeding 200 kilometers per hour (120 mph) was approved in 2013 [329] [needs update] North Korea connects with the Trans-Siberian Railway through Rajin.\n\n\nEnergy\nNorth Korea's energy infrastructure is obsolete and in disrepair Power shortages are chronic and would not be alleviated even by electricity imports because the poorly maintained grid causes significant losses during transmission [339] [340] Coal accounts for 70% of primary energy production, followed by hydroelectric power with 17% [328] The government under Kim Jong Un has increased emphasis on renewable energy projects like wind farms, solar parks, solar heating and biomass [341] A set of legal regulations adopted in 2014 stressed the development of geothermal, wind and solar energy along with recycling and environmental conservation [341] [342] North Korea's long-term objective is to curb fossil fuel usage and reach an output of 5 million kilowatts from renewable sources by 2044, up from its current total of 430,000 kilowatts from all sources Wind power is projected to satisfy 15% of the country's total energy demand under this strategy [343]\n\n\nScience and technology\nR&D efforts are concentrated at the State Academy of Sciences, which runs 40 research institutes, 200 smaller research centers, a scientific equipment factory and six publishing houses [345] The government considers science and technology to be directly linked to economic development [346] [347] A five-year scientific plan emphasizing IT, biotechnology, nanotechnology, marine technology, and laser and plasma research was carried out in the early 2000s [346] A 2010 report by the South Korean Science and Technology Policy Institute identified polymer chemistry, single carbon materials, nanoscience, mathematics, software, nuclear technology and rocketry as potential areas of inter-Korean scientific cooperation North Korean institutes are strong in these fields of research, although their engineers require additional training, and laboratories need equipment upgrades [348]\n\n\nDemographics\nNorth Korea's population was 10.9 million in 1961 [366] With the exception of a small Chinese community and a few ethnic Japanese, North Korea's 25,971,909 [367] [368] people are ethnically homogeneous [369] Demographic experts in the 20th century estimated that the population would grow to 25.5 million by 2000 and 28 million by 2010, but this increase never occurred due to the North Korean famine [370] The famine began in 1995, lasted for three years, and resulted in the deaths of between 240,000 and 420,000 North Koreans [66]\n\n\nLanguage\nNorth Korea shares the Korean language with South Korea, although some dialectal differences exist within both Koreas [373] North Koreans refer to their Pyongan dialect as munhwaŏ (\"cultured language\") as opposed to the dialects of South Korea, especially the Seoul dialect or p'yojun'ŏ (\"standard language\"), which are viewed as decadent because of its use of loanwords from Chinese and European languages (particularly English) [382] [383] Words of Chinese, Manchu or Western origin have been eliminated from munhwa along with the usage of Chinese hancha characters [382] Written language uses only the Chosŏn'gŭl (Hangul) phonetic alphabet, developed under Sejong the Great (1418–1450) [384] [385]\n\n\nReligion\nNorth Korea is officially an atheist state [386] [387] Its constitution guarantees freedom of religion under Article 68, but this principle is limited by the requirement that religion may not be used as a pretext to harm the state, introduce foreign forces, or harm the existing social order [98] [388] Religious practice is therefore restricted, [389] [390] despite nominal constitutional protections [391] Proselytizing is also prohibited due to concerns about foreign influence The number of Christian churchgoers nonetheless more than doubled between the 1980s and the early 2000s due to the recruitment of Christians who previously worshipped privately or in small house churches [392] The Open Doors mission, a Protestant group based in the United States and founded during the Cold War era, claims the most severe persecution of Christians in the world occurs in North Korea [393]\n\n\nEducation\nThe 2008 census listed the entire population as literate [381] An 11-year free, compulsory cycle of primary and secondary education is provided in more than 27,000 nursery schools, 14,000 kindergartens, 4,800 four-year primary and 4,700 six-year secondary schools [373] 77% of males and 79% of females aged 30–34 have finished secondary school [381] An additional 300 universities and colleges offer higher education [373]\n\n\nHealth\nNorth Korea has a life expectancy of 72.3 years in 2019, according to HDR 2020 [405] While North Korea is classified as a low-income country, the structure of North Korea's causes of death (2013) is unlike that of other low-income countries [406] Instead, it is closer to worldwide averages, with non-communicable diseases—such as cardiovascular disease and cancers—accounting for 84 percent of the total deaths in 2016 [407]\n\n\nSongbun\nAccording to North Korean documents and refugee testimonies, [418] all North Koreans are sorted into groups according to their Songbun, an ascribed status system based on a citizen's assessed loyalty to the government Based on their own behavior and the political, social, and economic background of their family for three generations as well as behavior by relatives within that range, Songbun is allegedly used to determine whether an individual is trusted with responsibility or given certain opportunities [419]\n\n\nCulture\nDespite a historically strong Chinese influence, Korean culture has shaped its own unique identity [423] It came under attack during the Japanese rule from 1910 to 1945, when Japan enforced a cultural assimilation policy Koreans were forced to learn and speak Japanese, adopt the Japanese family name system and Shinto religion, and were forbidden to write or speak the Korean language in schools, businesses, or public places [424]\n\n\nArt\nVisual arts are generally produced in the aesthetic of socialist realism [429] North Korean painting combines the influence of Soviet and Japanese visual expression to instill a sentimental loyalty to the system [430] All artists in North Korea are required to join the Artists' Union, and the best among them can receive an official license to portray the leaders Portraits and sculptures depicting Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un are classed as \"Number One works\" [429]\n\n\nLiterature\nAll publishing houses are owned by the government or the WPK because they are considered an important tool for agitprop [434] The Workers' Party of Korea Publishing House is the most authoritative among them and publishes all works of Kim Il Sung, ideological education materials and party policy documents [435] The availability of foreign literature is limited, examples being North Korean editions of Indian, German, Chinese and Russian fairy tales, Tales from Shakespeare, some works of Bertolt Brecht and Erich Kästner, [430] and the Harry Potter series [436]\n\n\nMusic\nThe government emphasized optimistic folk-based tunes and revolutionary music throughout most of the 20th century [425] Ideological messages are conveyed through massive orchestral pieces like the \"Five Great Revolutionary Operas\" based on traditional Korean ch'angguk [437] Revolutionary operas differ from their Western counterparts by adding traditional instruments to the orchestra and avoiding recitative segments [440] Sea of Blood is the most widely performed of the Five Great Operas: since its premiere in 1971, it has been played over 1,500 times, [441] and its 2010 tour in China was a major success [440] Western classical music by Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky and other composers is performed both by the State Symphony Orchestra and student orchestras [442]\n\n\nMedia\nGovernment policies towards film are no different from those applied to other arts—motion pictures serve to fulfill the targets of \"social education\" Some of the most influential films are based on historic events (An Jung-geun shoots Itō Hirobumi) or folk tales (Hong Gildong) [437] Most movies have predictable propaganda story lines which make cinema an unpopular entertainment; viewers only see films that feature their favorite actors [448] Western productions are only available at private showings to high-ranking Party members, [449] although the 1997 film Titanic is frequently shown to university students as an example of Western culture [450] Access to foreign media products is available through smuggled DVDs and television or radio broadcasts in border areas [451] Western films like The Interview, Charlie's Angels, and the aforementioned Titanic are just a few films that have been smuggled across the borders of North Korea, allowing for access to the North Korean citizens [452] [453]\n\n\nCuisine\nKorean cuisine has evolved through centuries of social and political change Originating from ancient agricultural and nomadic traditions in southern Manchuria and the Korean Peninsula, it has gone through a complex interaction of the natural environment and different cultural trends [464] Rice dishes and kimchi are staple Korean food In a traditional meal, they accompany both side dishes (panch'an) and main courses like juk, pulgogi or noodles Soju liquor is the best-known traditional Korean spirit [465]\n\n\nSports\nMost schools have daily practice in association football, basketball, table tennis, gymnastics, boxing and others The DPR Korea League is popular inside the country and its games are often televised [448] The national football team, Chollima, competed in the FIFA World Cup in 2010, when it lost all three matches against Brazil, Portugal and Ivory Coast [470] Its 1966 appearance was much more successful, seeing a surprise 1–0 victory over Italy and a quarter final loss to Portugal by 3–5 [471] A national team represents the nation in international basketball competitions as well In December 2013, former American basketball professional Dennis Rodman visited North Korea to help train the national team after he developed a friendship with Kim Jong Un [472]\n\n\nSee also\n40°N 127°E﻿ / ﻿40°N

The film is a sequel to Krasinski's 2018 film A Quiet Place, in which a family must navigate a post-apocalyptic world where creatures that hunt by sound have wiped out much of humanity. The film stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Simmonds, and John Krasinski, who also reprises his role from the first film.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place a year after the events of the first film, in which Evelyn Abbott (Emily Blunt) and her family are still living in a post-apocalyptic world where the creatures that hunt by sound have wiped out much of humanity. The family, which includes Evelyn's husband Lee (John Krasinski) and their children, Regan (Millicent Simmonds) and Marcus, are trying to survive in a world where every sound can be deadly.\n\nDuring a Little League Baseball game in the small town of Millbrook, New York, the Abbott family and other spectators witness a strange meteor-like object hurtle toward the Earth. Shortly after, the hostile extraterrestrial creatures dubbed Death Angels emerge from the meteor and begin slaughtering the townspeople. The blind creatures possess armored skin and extraordinary speed and strength, and track victims with hypersensitive hearing, attacking anything that makes even the slightest noise.\n\nAs the family tries to navigate this new threat, they discover that the creatures are not just mindless beasts, but are actually a highly intelligent and social species that communicate with each other through a form of echolocation. The family must use their wits and their knowledge of the creatures to survive and find a way to defeat them.\n\n**Cast**\n\nA Quiet Place Part II features a talented cast of actors, including:\n\n* Emily Blunt as Evelyn Abbott\n* Millicent Simmonds as Regan Abbott\n* John Krasinski as Lee Abbott\n* Noah Jupe as Marcus Abbott\n* Cillian Murphy as Emmett\n\n**Production**\n\nA Quiet Place Part II was produced under Paramount Pictures with a budget of $61 million.

Though she raced for fun as a child, she joined competitive athletics late, receiving an offer from an Olympic trainer to join his academy when she was about 15 years old. Her parents were initially worried, thinking she would not achieve an athletic career; they were convinced by Tsimanouskaya and her grandmother.\n\nTsimanouskaya's interest in athletics began when she was a child. She would often run with her friends in the countryside, which helped her develop her endurance and speed. However, it was not until she was offered a spot at an Olympic training academy that she began to take her running seriously. With the support of her family and her own determination, Tsimanouskaya began to focus on her athletic career.\n\nInternational Competitions\nTsimanouskaya made her international debut at the 2019 European Games, where she competed in the 100 m and 200 m events. She did not finish in the final.\n\nThe 2020 Tokyo Olympics were Tsimanouskaya's first major international competition.

Prior to the 200 m event, Belarus Olympic Committee (NOC RB) officials withdrew her from the competition. Tsimanouskaya was not given a reason for her withdrawal, and she was not informed until after the event had already begun.\n\nTsimanouskaya's teammates were supportive of her, and they expressed their solidarity with her on social media. However, the NOC RB's decision to withdraw her from the competition sparked a heated debate about the treatment of athletes by the Belarusian sports authorities.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Tsimanouskaya's withdrawal from the 200 m event continued to unfold in the days that followed. On 2 August, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) rejected Tsimanouskaya's request to annul the decision of the NOC RB to stop her from participating at the Tokyo Olympics. The CAS stated that Tsimanouskaya was unable to prove her case.\n\nRepatriation Incident and Asylum\nOn 30 July 2021, Tsimanouskaya recorded an Instagram video criticising officials from the Belarus Olympic Committee (NOC RB). She stated that they had entered her in the 4 × 400 m relay race, a distance she had never contested, without her consent.\n\nThe video sparked a wave of support for Tsimanouskaya, with many athletes and sports officials expressing their solidarity with her. However, her actions also sparked a reaction from the Belarusian authorities. On 1 August 2021, Belarusian media reported that Tsimanouskaya was attempting to flee the country, and she was trying to claim asylum.\n\nTsimanouskaya's attempt to escape the country was met with resistance from the Belarusian authorities.

Mine just happened to resonate over the years, in one way and another, with a significant enough number of people so that I could do it professionally.\n\n\nCareer overview\nI don't record (any type of genre of music) that I didn't hear in my family's living room by the time I was 10 It just is my rule that I don't break because .. I can't do it authentically ..

I can't do it authentically .. I really think that you're just hard-wiring (synapses) in your brain up until the age of maybe 12 or 10, and there are certain things you can't learn in an authentic way after that.\n\n\nBeginning of professional career\nAt age 14, Ronstadt formed a folk trio with her brother Peter and sister Gretchen The group played coffeehouses, fraternity houses, and other small venues, billing themselves as \"the Union City Ramblers\" and \"the Three Ronstadts\", and they even recorded themselves at a Tucson studio under the name \"the New Union Ramblers\" [59] Their repertoire included the music they grew up on – folk, country, bluegrass, and Mexican [60] But increasingly, Ronstadt wanted to make a union of folk music and rock 'n' roll, [44] and in 1964, after a semester at the University of Arizona, [61] the 18-year-old decided to move to Los Angeles [62] [63] [64]\n\n\nThe Stone Poneys\nRonstadt visited a friend from Tucson, Bobby Kimmel, in Los Angeles during Easter break from college in 1964, and later that year, shortly before her eighteenth birthday, [62] decided to move there permanently to form a band with him [63] Kimmel had already begun co-writing folk-rock songs with guitarist-songwriter Kenny Edwards, and eventually the three of them were signed by Nik Venet to Capitol in the summer of 1966 as \"the Stone Poneys\" The trio released three albums in a 15-month period in 1967–68: The Stone Poneys; Evergreen, Volume 2; and Linda Ronstadt, Stone Poneys and Friends, Vol III The band is widely known for their hit single \"Different Drum\" (written by Michael Nesmith prior to his joining the Monkees), which reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart as well as number 12 in Cashbox magazine Nearly 50 years later, the song remains one of Ronstadt's most popular recordings [65]\n\n\nSolo career\nStill contractually obligated to Capitol Records, Ronstadt released her first solo album, Hand Sown .. Home Grown, in 1969 It has been called the first alternative country record by a female recording artist [41] During this same period, she contributed to the Music from Free Creek \"super session\" project.\n\n\nTouring\nJudy Henske, who was the then reigning queen of folk music, said to me at The Troubadour, \"Honey, in this town there are four sexes Men, women, homosexuals, and girl singers.\"\n\n\nCollaborations with Peter Asher\nIn general when you fall in love with an artist and their music, the plan is a fairly simple one . get people to go and see them, and make a record that you think properly presents their music to the public and some of which you can get on the radio.\n\n\nVocal styles\nI grew up singing Mexican music, and that's based on indigenous Mexican rhythms Mexican music also has an overlay of West African music, based on huapango drums, and it's kind of like a 6/8 time signature, but it really is a very syncopated 6/8 And that's how I attack vocals.\n\n\nInterpretive singer\nRonstadt is considered an \"interpreter of her times\", [85] and has earned praise for her courage to put her \"stamp\" on many of her songs [86] Ronstadt herself has indicated that some of her 1970s hits were recorded under considerable pressure to create commercially successful recordings, and that she prefers many of her songs that were non-hit album tracks [59] An infrequent songwriter, Ronstadt co-composed only three songs over her long career \n\n\nMost successful female singer of the 1970s\nAuthor Andrew Greeley, in his book God in Popular Culture, described Ronstadt as \"the most successful and certainly the most durable and most gifted woman Rock singer of her era.\" [91] Signaling her wide popularity as a concert artist, outside of the singles charts and the recording studio, Dirty Linen magazine describes her as the \"first true woman rock 'n' roll superstar .. (selling) out stadiums with a string of mega-successful albums.\" [41] Cashbox gave Ronstadt a Special Decade Award, [92] as the top-selling female singer of the 1970s [32]\n\n\nTime and \"rock chick\" image\nRonstadt said she was \"artificially encouraged to kinda cop a really tough attitude (and be tough) because rock and roll is kind of tough (business)\" [15] Female rock artists like her and Janis Joplin, whom she described as lovely, shy, and literate in real life and the antithesis of the \"red hot mamma\" she was artificially encouraged to project, went through an identity crisis [15]\n\n\nHighest-paid woman in rock\nRock is the thumping heart of Linda's music, and the rock world is dominated by males The biggest stars are male, and so are the back-up musicians .. rock beats are .. phallic, and lyrics .. masculine. .. Janis Joplin, the first great white woman rocker, rattled the bars .. but she died. .. Joni Mitchell .. stylish (but can't) compete in drawing power with men .. (however) Linda Ronstadt .. has made herself one of the biggest individual rock draws in the world.\n\n\nFrom rock to operetta\nRampant eclecticism is my middle name.\n\n\nArtistic aspirations\nRonstadt has remarked that in the beginning of her career she \"was so focused on folk, rock and country\" that she \"got a bit bored and started to branch out, and ..  [has] been doing that ever since.\" [124] By 1983, her estimated worth was over $40 million [125] mostly from records, concerts and merchandising.\n\n\nJazz/pop trilogy\nIn 1981, Ronstadt produced and recorded an album of pop standards (later marketed in bootleg form) titled Keeping Out of Mischief with the assistance of producer Jerry Wexler However, Ronstadt's displeasure with the result led her, with regrets, to scrap the project \"Doing that killed me,\" she said in a Time magazine interview [133] But the appeal of the album's music had seduced Ronstadt, as she told DownBeat in April 1985, crediting Wexler for encouraging her [134] Nonetheless, Ronstadt had to convince her reluctant record company, Elektra, to approve this type of album under her contract [135]\n\n\n\"Trio\" recordings\nWhen (we) sang, it was a beautiful and different sound I've never heard before We (recorded the vocals) as individual parts, because we didn't have the luxury of spending a lot of time together on a tour bus .. and knowing each other's (vocal) moves .. takes years.\n\n\nCanciones de Mi Padre\nAt the end of 1987, Ronstadt released Canciones de Mi Padre, an album of traditional Mexican folk songs, or what she has described as \"world class songs\" Keeping with the Ronstadt history theme, her cover art was dramatic, bold, and colorful; it shows Ronstadt in full Mexican regalia Her musical arranger was mariachi musician Rubén Fuentes.\n\n\nReturning to the contemporary music scene\nBy the late 1980s, while enjoying the success of her big band jazz collaborations with Riddle and her surprise hit mariachi recordings, Ronstadt elected to return to recording mainstream pop music once again In 1987, she made a return to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart with \"Somewhere Out There\", which peaked at number 2 in March [98] Featured in the animated film An American Tail, the sentimental duet with James Ingram was nominated for several Grammy Awards, ultimately winning the Grammy Award for Song of the Year The song also received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Song and achieved high sales, earning a million-selling gold single in the U.S. – one of the last 45s ever to do so It was also accompanied by a popular music video On the heels of this success, Steven Spielberg asked Ronstadt to record the theme song for the animated sequel titled An American Tail: Fievel Goes West, which was titled \"Dreams to Dream\" Although \"Dreams to Dream\" failed to achieve the success of \"Somewhere Out There\", the song did give Ronstadt an Adult Contemporary hit in 1991.\n\n\nReturn to roots music\nRonstadt released the highly acclaimed Winter Light album at the end of 1993 It included New Age arrangements such as the lead single \"Heartbeats Accelerating\" as well as the self-penned title track and featured the glass harmonica It was her first commercial failure since 1972, and peaked at number 92 in Billboard, whereas 1995's Feels Like Home was Ronstadt's much-heralded return to country-rock and included her version of Tom Petty's classic hit \"The Waiting\" The single's rollicking, fiddle-infused flip side, \"Walk On\", returned Ronstadt to the Country Singles chart for the first time since 1983 An album track entitled \"The Blue Train\" charted 10 weeks in Billboard's Adult Contemporary Top 40 This album fared slightly better than its predecessor, reaching number 75 Both albums were later deleted from the Elektra/Asylum catalog Ronstadt was nominated for three Lo Nuestro Awards in 1993: Female Regional Mexican Artist of the Year, Female Tropical/Salsa Artist of the Year, and her version of the song \"Perfidia\" was also listed for Tropical/Salsa Song of the Year [147]\n\n\nRetirement\nIn 2011, Ronstadt was interviewed by the Arizona Daily Star and announced her retirement [48] In August 2013, she revealed to Alanna Nash, writing for AARP, that she had Parkinson's disease and could \"no longer sing a note.\" [150] Her diagnosis was subsequently re-evaluated as progressive supranuclear palsy [25] Her memoir Feels Like Home: A Song for the Sonoran Borderlands was published in 2022 [151]\n\n\nSelected career achievements\nOn April 10, 2014, Ronstadt was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame [152] In July 2019, Ronstadt was selected as a Kennedy Center Honoree [153] On May 7, 2022, during the International Mariachi Conference, the Tucson Music Hall at the Tucson Convention Center was officially renamed as The Linda Ronstadt Music Hall [154]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn the early 1970s, Ronstadt briefly dated fellow musician JD Souther, who co-produced her Don't Cry Now album [161] Beginning in the mid-1970s, Ronstadt's private life became increasingly public It was fueled by a relationship with then-Governor of California Jerry Brown, a Democratic presidential candidate They shared a Newsweek magazine cover in April 1979, [162] as well as the covers of Us Weekly and People magazine.\n\n\nPolitical activism\nRonstadt's politics received criticism and praise during and after her July 17, 2004, performance at the Aladdin Theatre for the Performing Arts in Las Vegas Toward the end of the show, as she had done across the country, Ronstadt spoke to the audience, praising Fahrenheit 9/11, Michael Moore's documentary film about the Iraq War; she dedicated the song \"Desperado\" to Moore [177] Accounts say the crowd's initial reaction was mixed, with \"half the crowd heartily applauding her praise for Moore, (and) the other half booing.\" [177]\n\n\nNational arts advocacy\nIn the United States we spend millions of dollars on sports because it promotes teamwork, discipline, and the experience of learning to make great progress in small increments Learning to play music together does all this and more.\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nGrammy Awards\n\n\nLatin Grammy Awards\n\n\nPrimetime Emmy Awards\n\n\nTony Awards\n\n\nGolden Globe Awards\n\n\nArizona Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame\n\n\nAcademy of Country Music\n\n\nCountry Music Association\n\n\nAmerican Latino Media Arts\n\n\nLo Nuestro nominations\n\n\nKennedy Center\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nVideography, filmography and stage appearances\n\n\nBooks\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Linda Ronstadt\n\nLinda Ronstadt is a renowned American singer, songwriter, and musician who has been active in the music industry since the 1960s.

I really think that you're just hard-wiring (synapses) in your brain up until the age of maybe 12 or 10, and there are certain things you can't learn in an authentic way after that.\n\n\nBeginning of professional career\nAt age 14, Ronstadt formed a folk trio with her brother Peter and sister Gretchen The group played coffeehouses, fraternity houses, and other small venues, billing themselves as \"the Union City Ramblers\" and \"the Three Ronstadts\", and they even recorded themselves at a Tucson studio under the name \"the New Union Ramblers\" [59] Their repertoire included the music they grew up on – folk, country, bluegrass, and Mexican [60] But increasingly, Ronstadt wanted to make a union of folk music and rock 'n' roll, [44] and in 1964, after a semester at the University of Arizona, [61] the 18-year-old decided to move to Los Angeles [62] [63] [64]\n\n\nThe Stone Poneys\nRonstadt visited a friend from Tucson, Bobby Kimmel, in Los Angeles during Easter break from college in 1964, and later that year, shortly before her eighteenth birthday, [62] decided to move there permanently to form a band with him [63] Kimmel had already begun co-writing folk-rock songs with guitarist-songwriter Kenny Edwards, and eventually the three of them were signed by Nik Venet to Capitol in the summer of 1966 as \"the Stone Poneys\" The trio released three albums in a 15-month period in 1967–68: The Stone Poneys; Evergreen, Volume 2; and Linda Ronstadt, Stone Poneys and Friends, Vol III The band is widely known for their hit single \"Different Drum\" (written by Michael Nesmith prior to his joining the Monkees), which reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart as well as number 12 in Cashbox magazine Nearly 50 years later, the song remains one of Ronstadt's most popular recordings [65]\n\n\nSolo career\nStill contractually obligated to Capitol Records, Ronstadt released her first solo album, Hand Sown .. Home Grown, in 1969 It has been called the first alternative country record by a female recording artist [41] During this same period, she contributed to the Music from Free Creek \"super session\" project.\n\n\nTouring\nJudy Henske, who was the then reigning queen of folk music, said to me at The Troubadour, \"Honey, in this town there are four sexes Men, women, homosexuals, and girl singers.\"\n\n\nCollaborations with Peter Asher\nIn general when you fall in love with an artist and their music, the plan is a fairly simple one . get people to go and see them, and make a record that you think properly presents their music to the public and some of which you can get on the radio.\n\n\nVocal styles\nI grew up singing Mexican music, and that's based on indigenous Mexican rhythms Mexican music also has an overlay of West African music, based on huapango drums, and it's kind of like a 6/8 time signature, but it really is a very syncopated 6/8 And that's how I attack vocals.\n\n\nInterpretive singer\nRonstadt is considered an \"interpreter of her times\", [85] and has earned praise for her courage to put her \"stamp\" on many of her songs [86] Ronstadt herself has indicated that some of her 1970s hits were recorded under considerable pressure to create commercially successful recordings, and that she prefers many of her songs that were non-hit album tracks [59] An infrequent songwriter, Ronstadt co-composed only three songs over her long career \n\n\nMost successful female singer of the 1970s\nAuthor Andrew Greeley, in his book God in Popular Culture, described Ronstadt as \"the most successful and certainly the most durable and most gifted woman Rock singer of her era.\" [91] Signaling her wide popularity as a concert artist, outside of the singles charts and the recording studio, Dirty Linen magazine describes her as the \"first true woman rock 'n' roll superstar .. (selling) out stadiums with a string of mega-successful albums.\" [41] Cashbox gave Ronstadt a Special Decade Award, [92] as the top-selling female singer of the 1970s [32]\n\n\nTime and \"rock chick\" image\nRonstadt said she was \"artificially encouraged to kinda cop a really tough attitude (and be tough) because rock and roll is kind of tough (business)\" [15] Female rock artists like her and Janis Joplin, whom she described as lovely, shy, and literate in real life and the antithesis of the \"red hot mamma\" she was artificially encouraged to project, went through an identity crisis [15]\n\n\nHighest-paid woman in rock\nRock is the thumping heart of Linda's music, and the rock world is dominated by males The biggest stars are male, and so are the back-up musicians .. rock beats are .. phallic, and lyrics .. masculine. .. Janis Joplin, the first great white woman rocker, rattled the bars .. but she died. .. Joni Mitchell .. stylish (but can't) compete in drawing power with men .. (however) Linda Ronstadt .. has made herself one of the biggest individual rock draws in the world.\n\n\nFrom rock to operetta\nRampant eclecticism is my middle name.\n\n\nArtistic aspirations\nRonstadt has remarked that in the beginning of her career she \"was so focused on folk, rock and country\" that she \"got a bit bored and started to branch out, and ..  [has] been doing that ever since.\" [124] By 1983, her estimated worth was over $40 million [125] mostly from records, concerts and merchandising.\n\n\nJazz/pop trilogy\nIn 1981, Ronstadt produced and recorded an album of pop standards (later marketed in bootleg form) titled Keeping Out of Mischief with the assistance of producer Jerry Wexler However, Ronstadt's displeasure with the result led her, with regrets, to scrap the project \"Doing that killed me,\" she said in a Time magazine interview [133] But the appeal of the album's music had seduced Ronstadt, as she told DownBeat in April 1985, crediting Wexler for encouraging her [134] Nonetheless, Ronstadt had to convince her reluctant record company, Elektra, to approve this type of album under her contract [135]\n\n\n\"Trio\" recordings\nWhen (we) sang, it was a beautiful and different sound I've never heard before We (recorded the vocals) as individual parts, because we didn't have the luxury of spending a lot of time together on a tour bus .. and knowing each other's (vocal) moves .. takes years.\n\n\nCanciones de Mi Padre\nAt the end of 1987, Ronstadt released Canciones de Mi Padre, an album of traditional Mexican folk songs, or what she has described as \"world class songs\" Keeping with the Ronstadt history theme, her cover art was dramatic, bold, and colorful; it shows Ronstadt in full Mexican regalia Her musical arranger was mariachi musician Rubén Fuentes.\n\n\nReturning to the contemporary music scene\nBy the late 1980s, while enjoying the success of her big band jazz collaborations with Riddle and her surprise hit mariachi recordings, Ronstadt elected to return to recording mainstream pop music once again In 1987, she made a return to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart with \"Somewhere Out There\", which peaked at number 2 in March [98] Featured in the animated film An American Tail, the sentimental duet with James Ingram was nominated for several Grammy Awards, ultimately winning the Grammy Award for Song of the Year The song also received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Song and achieved high sales, earning a million-selling gold single in the U.S. – one of the last 45s ever to do so It was also accompanied by a popular music video On the heels of this success, Steven Spielberg asked Ronstadt to record the theme song for the animated sequel titled An American Tail: Fievel Goes West, which was titled \"Dreams to Dream\" Although \"Dreams to Dream\" failed to achieve the success of \"Somewhere Out There\", the song did give Ronstadt an Adult Contemporary hit in 1991.\n\n\nReturn to roots music\nRonstadt released the highly acclaimed Winter Light album at the end of 1993 It included New Age arrangements such as the lead single \"Heartbeats Accelerating\" as well as the self-penned title track and featured the glass harmonica It was her first commercial failure since 1972, and peaked at number 92 in Billboard, whereas 1995's Feels Like Home was Ronstadt's much-heralded return to country-rock and included her version of Tom Petty's classic hit \"The Waiting\" The single's rollicking, fiddle-infused flip side, \"Walk On\", returned Ronstadt to the Country Singles chart for the first time since 1983 An album track entitled \"The Blue Train\" charted 10 weeks in Billboard's Adult Contemporary Top 40 This album fared slightly better than its predecessor, reaching number 75 Both albums were later deleted from the Elektra/Asylum catalog Ronstadt was nominated for three Lo Nuestro Awards in 1993: Female Regional Mexican Artist of the Year, Female Tropical/Salsa Artist of the Year, and her version of the song \"Perfidia\" was also listed for Tropical/Salsa Song of the Year [147]\n\n\nRetirement\nIn 2011, Ronstadt was interviewed by the Arizona Daily Star and announced her retirement [48] In August 2013, she revealed to Alanna Nash, writing for AARP, that she had Parkinson's disease and could \"no longer sing a note.\" [150] Her diagnosis was subsequently re-evaluated as progressive supranuclear palsy [25] Her memoir Feels Like Home: A Song for the Sonoran Borderlands was published in 2022 [151]\n\n\nSelected career achievements\nOn April 10, 2014, Ronstadt was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame [152] In July 2019, Ronstadt was selected as a Kennedy Center Honoree [153] On May 7, 2022, during the International Mariachi Conference, the Tucson Music Hall at the Tucson Convention Center was officially renamed as The Linda Ronstadt Music Hall [154]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn the early 1970s, Ronstadt briefly dated fellow musician JD Souther, who co-produced her Don't Cry Now album [161] Beginning in the mid-1970s, Ronstadt's private life became increasingly public It was fueled by a relationship with then-Governor of California Jerry Brown, a Democratic presidential candidate They shared a Newsweek magazine cover in April 1979, [162] as well as the covers of Us Weekly and People magazine.\n\n\nPolitical activism\nRonstadt's politics received criticism and praise during and after her July 17, 2004, performance at the Aladdin Theatre for the Performing Arts in Las Vegas Toward the end of the show, as she had done across the country, Ronstadt spoke to the audience, praising Fahrenheit 9/11, Michael Moore's documentary film about the Iraq War; she dedicated the song \"Desperado\" to Moore [177] Accounts say the crowd's initial reaction was mixed, with \"half the crowd heartily applauding her praise for Moore, (and) the other half booing.\" [177]\n\n\nNational arts advocacy\nIn the United States we spend millions of dollars on sports because it promotes teamwork, discipline, and the experience of learning to make great progress in small increments Learning to play music together does all this and more.\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nGrammy Awards\n\n\nLatin Grammy Awards\n\n\nPrimetime Emmy Awards\n\n\nTony Awards\n\n\nGolden Globe Awards\n\n\nArizona Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame\n\n\nAcademy of Country Music\n\n\nCountry Music Association\n\n\nAmerican Latino Media Arts\n\n\nLo Nuestro nominations\n\n\nKennedy Center\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nVideography, filmography and stage appearances\n\n\nBooks\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It's simple, and this is what art does and this is what stories do They comfort us and they're important.\n\n\nPre-production\nAs explained by Lana Wachowski during the Berlin International Literature Festival 2021, Warner Bros constantly approached the Wachowskis every year to make another Matrix sequel, but the Wachowskis always declined the offers out of a lack of interest and because of their feelings that the trilogy's story had concluded However, in 2019, Ron and Lynne Wachowski, the Wachowskis' parents, died alongside a close friend of Lana's, with her father passing away first, her friend second and her mother third After not being able to process that kind of grief, Lana suddenly conceived the story of The Matrix Resurrections one sleepless night In her words, Wachowski felt that while she could not have her parents back, she then could have Neo and Trinity back, feeling very comforted to see them alive again [33] With Lana Wachowski stepping forward for a sequel, Warner Bros readily accepted her concept, eager to have the franchise's creator aboard for the sequel, according to McTeigue [43]\n\n\nCasting\nReeves and Moss were confirmed to be reprising their roles as Neo and Trinity upon the film's announcement in August 2019 [5] In October 2019, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II was cast in the film, with some sources speculating he would be playing a young Morpheus, while Neil Patrick Harris was added in an undisclosed role [52] [53] Following the first trailer's release, Abdul-Mateen II confirmed that he was indeed playing the role of Morpheus [8] Laurence Fishburne, who portrayed Morpheus in the original trilogy, announced in August 2020 that he was not asked to reprise his role as Morpheus [54] Pinkett Smith entered negotiations to reprise her role as Niobe, with Jessica Henwick entering negotiations to join in an undisclosed role, [55] [56] later revealed as Bugs [13] Henwick was being considered by The Walt Disney Company to audition for a role in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) at the same time she was offered to audition for the part of Bugs; in what she described a \"red-pill/blue-pill moment\" for her, Henwick chose Resurrections over Shang-Chi [10] Jada Pinkett-Smith and Jessica Henwick were confirmed in December, along with the additions of Jonathan Groff and Toby Onwumere; [57] [58] Pinkett-Smith was convinced to return after learning from Wachowski how much the film meant for her They went through a \"couple different versions\" for Niobe until they settled to depict the character in an elderly form [59]\n\n\nFilming\nUnlike the previous films, which were shot predominantly in Australia, [71] The Matrix Resurrections was filmed in the United States and Europe.\n\n\nMusic\nIn September 2021, Warner Bros confirmed that Johnny Klimek and Tom Tykwer would be scoring the film, having previously collaborated with Wachowski on Sense8 and Cloud Atlas, [87] replacing Don Davis, who composed the score for the first three films The 1967 song \"White Rabbit\" by Jefferson Airplane is prominently featured in the trailer and film [88] [89] Wachowski said the choice of \"White Rabbit\" for the trailer not only was in reference to elements of Lewis Carroll's 1865 novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland that The Matrix had previously used and which \"White Rabbit\" is based on, but also a nod to Jefferson Airplane themselves which was formed as a house band for The Matrix club in San Francisco [90] The second trailer featured an electronic/orchestral cover of the Rage Against the Machine song \"Wake Up\" by Sebastian Böhm [91] The original song featured prominently at the end of the first Matrix film, [92] and Resurrections features in its ending a cover by Brass Against [93]\n\n\nMarketing\nOn August 24, 2021, the title was revealed as The Matrix Resurrections [95] A trailer was screened as part of Warner Bros.' panel at CinemaCon that day, featuring a meeting

It's simple, and this is what art does and this is what stories do They comfort us and they're important.\n\n\nPre-production\nAs explained by Lana Wachowski during the Berlin International Literature Festival 2021, Warner Bros constantly approached the Wachowskis every year to make another Matrix sequel, but the Wachowskis always declined the offers out of a lack of interest and because of their feelings that the trilogy's story had concluded However, in 2019, Ron and Lynne Wachowski, the Wachowskis' parents, died alongside a close friend of Lana's, with her father passing away first, her friend second and her mother third After not being able to process that kind of grief, Lana suddenly conceived the story of The Matrix Resurrections one sleepless night In her words, Wachowski felt that while she could not have her parents back, she then could have Neo and Trinity back, feeling very comforted to see them alive again [33] With Lana Wachowski stepping forward for a sequel, Warner Bros readily accepted her concept, eager to have the franchise's creator aboard for the sequel, according to McTeigue [43]\n\n\nCasting\nReeves and Moss were confirmed to be reprising their roles as Neo and Trinity upon the film's announcement in August 2019 [5] In October 2019, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II was cast in the film, with some sources speculating he would be playing a young Morpheus, while Neil Patrick Harris was added in an undisclosed role [52] [53] Following the first trailer's release, Abdul-Mateen II confirmed that he was indeed playing the role of Morpheus [8] Laurence Fishburne, who portrayed Morpheus in the original trilogy, announced in August 2020 that he was not asked to reprise his role as Morpheus [54] Pinkett Smith entered negotiations to reprise her role as Niobe, with Jessica Henwick entering negotiations to join in an undisclosed role, [55] [56] later revealed as Bugs [13] Henwick was being considered by The Walt Disney Company to audition for a role in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) at the same time she was offered to audition for the part of Bugs; in what she described a \"red-pill/blue-pill moment\" for her, Henwick chose Resurrections over Shang-Chi [10] Jada Pinkett-Smith and Jessica Henwick were confirmed in December, along with the additions of Jonathan Groff and Toby Onwumere; [57] [58] Pinkett-Smith was convinced to return after learning from Wachowski how much the film meant for her They went through a \"couple different versions\" for Niobe until they settled to depict the character in an elderly form [59]\n\n\nFilming\nUnlike the previous films, which were shot predominantly in Australia, [71] The Matrix Resurrections was filmed in the United States and Europe.\n\n\nMusic\nIn September 2021, Warner Bros confirmed that Johnny Klimek and Tom Tykwer would be scoring the film, having previously collaborated with Wachowski on Sense8 and Cloud Atlas, [87] replacing Don Davis, who composed the score for the first three films The 1967 song \"White Rabbit\" by Jefferson Airplane is prominently featured in the trailer and film [88] [89] Wachowski said the choice of \"White Rabbit\" for the trailer not only was in reference to elements of Lewis Carroll's 1865 novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland that The Matrix had previously used and which \"White Rabbit\" is based on, but also a nod to Jefferson Airplane themselves which was formed as a house band for The Matrix club in San Francisco [90] The second trailer featured an electronic/orchestral cover of the Rage Against the Machine song \"Wake Up\" by Sebastian Böhm [91] The original song featured prominently at the end of the first Matrix film, [92] and Resurrections features in its ending a cover by Brass Against [93]\n\n\nMarketing\nOn August 24, 2021, the title was revealed as The Matrix Resurrections [95] A trailer was screened as part of Warner Bros.' panel at CinemaCon that day, featuring a meeting

{"title": "Everton_F.C.", "content": "\nHistory\nEverton was founded as St Domingo's FC in 1878 [11] [12] so that members of the congregation of St Domingo Methodist New Connexion Chapel in Breckfield Road North, Everton, could play sport year round – cricket was played in summer The club's first game was a 1–0 victory over Everton Church Club [13] The club was renamed Everton in November 1879 after the local area, as people outside the congregation wished to participate [13] [14]\n\n\nColours and badge\nEverton's traditional home colours are royal blue shirts, white shorts and white socks However, during the first decades of their history, Everton had several different kit colours The team originally played in white and then blue and white stripes, but as new players arriving at the club wore their old team's shirts during matches, confusion soon ensued It was decided that the shirts would be dyed black, both to save on expenses and to instill a more professional look However, the kit appeared morbid, so a scarlet sash was added [68] When the club moved to Goodison Park in 1892, the colours were salmon pink and dark blue striped shirts with dark blue shorts The club later switched to ruby shirts with blue trim and dark blue shorts Royal blue jerseys with white shorts were first used in the 1901–02 season [68] The club played in sky blue in 1906; however, the fans protested, and the colour reverted to royal blue Occasionally, Everton have played in lighter shades than royal blue (such as in 1930–31 and 1997–98) [69] The home kit today is royal blue shirts with white shorts and socks The club may also wear all blue to avoid any colour clashes.\nEverton's traditional away colours were white shirts with black shorts, but from 1968 amber shirts and royal blue shorts became common Various editions appeared throughout the 1970s and 1980s Black, white, grey, and yellow away shirts have also been used.\n\nNickname\nEverton's most widely recognised nickname is \"The Toffees\" or \"The Toffeemen\", which came about after Everton had moved to Goodison There are several explanations for how this name came to be adopted with the best known being that there was a business in Everton village, between Everton Brow and Brow Side, named Mother Noblett's, which was a toffee shop that sold sweets including Everton Mints (a type of humbug) It was also located opposite the lock-up on which Everton's club crest is based The Toffee Lady tradition, in which a girl walks around the perimeter of the pitch before the start of a game tossing free Everton Mints into the crowd, symbolises the connection Another possible reason is that there was a house named Ye Anciente Everton Toffee House in nearby Village Street, Everton, run by Ma Bushell The toffee house was located near the Queen's Head hotel in which early club meetings took place [78]\n\n\nStadiums\nEverton originally played in the southeast corner of Stanley Park The first official match took place in 1879 In 1882, a man named J Cruitt donated land at Priory Road which became the club's home In 1884 Everton became tenants at Anfield, which was owned by John Orrell, a land owner who was a friend of Everton F.C member John Houlding Orrell lent Anfield to the club in exchange for a small rent Houlding purchased the land from Orrell in 1885 and effectively became Everton's landlord by charging the club rent, which increased from £100 to £240 a year by 1888 – and was still rising until Everton left the ground in 1892 [82] [83] The club regarded the increase in rent as unacceptable [83] A further dispute between Houlding and the club's committee led to Houlding attempting to gain full control of the club by registering the company, \"Everton F.C and Athletic Grounds Ltd\" Everton left Anfield for a new ground, Goodison Park, where the club has played ever since Houlding attempted to take over Everton's name, colours, fixtures and league position, but was denied by The Football Association Instead, Houlding formed a new club, Liverpool F.C [84]\n\n\nEarly grounds\nEverton originally played in the southeast corner of Stanley Park The first official match took place

Association Instead, Houlding formed a new club, Liverpool F.C [84]\n\n\nGoodison Park\nGoodison Park, the first major football stadium to be built in England, was opened in 1892 [85] Goodison Park has staged more top-flight football games than any other ground in the United Kingdom and was the only English club ground to host a semi-final at the 1966 FIFA World Cup It was also the first English ground to have under-soil heating and the first to have two tiers on all sides The church grounds of St Luke the Evangelist are adjacent to the corner of the Main Stand and the Howard Kendall Gwladys Street End [86]\n\n\nEverton Stadium\nTalks regarding a new Everton stadium began in 1996 The original plan was for a 60,000-seat stadium, followed by a proposal for a 55,000-seat stadium at King's Dock, which was rejected due to funding issues [90] In 2004, Everton entered talks with Liverpool F.C about sharing a proposed stadium on Stanley Park, but negotiations broke down as Everton could not raise 50% of the costs [91]\n\n\nTraining grounds\nFrom 1966 to 2007, Everton trained at Bellefield in the West Derby area of Liverpool [94] In 2007, the club moved to the Finch Farm training complex in Halewood after acquiring it the previous year The first team squad officially moved to the complex on 9 October 2007 The training ground is now used by both the Everton men and women's first team and the youth academy [95] The training ground features 10 full-size grass pitches across three slabs, one of which is a floodlit pitch along with a synthetic pitch with additional floodlights and dedicated training areas for fitness and goalkeeping training, as well as a recreated Goodison Park pitch Within the training complex, there are changing facilities for senior players and academy players Facilities include: fitness centre, synthetic indoor training pitch, hydrotherapy pool, spa, sauna, physiotherapy room, media centre, video lounge including video editing suite [96]\n\n\nSupport\nEverton has a large fanbase, with the eighth-highest average attendance in the Premier League in the 2008–09 season [97] The club's supporters are colloquially known as Evertonians or Blues [8] The majority of Everton's matchday support comes from the North West of England, primarily Merseyside, Cheshire, West Lancashire and parts of Western Greater Manchester along with many fans who travel from North Wales, Ireland, and Scotland Within the city of Liverpool, support for Everton and city rivals Liverpool is not determined by geographical basis with supporters mixed across the city Everton also has many supporters' clubs worldwide [98] in places such as North America, [99] Singapore, [100] Indonesia, [101] Lebanon, Malaysia, [102] Thailand, India, [103] [104] and Australia [105] [106] Paul McCartney is an Everton supporter [107] The official supporters club is FOREVERTON, [108] and there are also several fanzines including When Skies are Grey and Speke from the Harbour, which are sold around Goodison Park on match days.\n\n\nRivalries\nEverton's biggest rivalry is with neighbours Liverpool, against whom the club contests the Merseyside derby The rivalry stems from an internal dispute between Everton officials and the owners of Anfield, which was then Everton's home ground The dispute resulted in Everton moving to Goodison Park and the subsequent formation of Liverpool F.C in 1892 Following these events, a fierce rivalry has existed between Everton and Liverpool, albeit one that is generally perceived as more respectful than many other derbies in English football This was illustrated by a chain of red and blue scarves that were linked between the gates of both grounds across Stanley Park as a tribute to the Liverpool fans killed in the Hillsborough disaster [110] The derby is usually a sellout fixture and has been known as the \"friendly derby\" because both sets of fans can often be seen side by side dressed in red and blue inside both Anfield and Goodison Park [111] On the field, matches have tended to be extremely stormy affairs; the derby has had more red cards than any other fixture in Premier League history [112]\n\n\nOwnership and finances\nEverton F.C is a limited company with the board of directors holding a majority of the shares [113] The club's most recent accounts, from May 2014, show a net total debt of £28.1 million, with a turnover of £120.5 million and a profit of £28.2 million [114] The club's overdraft with Barclays Bank is secured against the Premier League's \"Basic Award Fund\", [115] which is a guaranteed sum given to clubs for competing in the Premier League [116] Everton agreed to a long-term loan of £30 million with Bear Stearns and Prudential plc in 2002 for a duration of 25 years The loan was a consolidation of debts at the time as well as a source of capital for new player acquisitions [117] Goodison Park is secured as collateral On 27 February 2016, it was announced that Farhad Moshiri would buy a 49.9% stake in the club [118] On 15 September 2023, Everton announced that Miami-based 777 Partners had signed an agreement with Farhad Moshiri to acquire his full 94.1% stake in the club, pending ratification by the Premier League through the owners' and directors' test [119] The takeover collapsed as it did not meet its deadline of 1 June 2024 [120] This deal collapsed on July 19th 2024 due to issues in regards to debts to 777 partners and A-Cap Holdings [121]\n\n\nShirt sponsors and manufacturers\nSince the 2022–23 season, the club's primary shirt sponsor has been online betting company Stake.com, after the club announced the early termination of the previous deal with SportPesa in February 2020 [126] Partners with Stake became a club-record sponsorship deal [127] Ahead of the Premier League season, the Stake.com features on the front of the men's and women's playing shirts as well as appearing on screens and media backdrops at Goodison Park and Finch Farm [128] The sponsorship does not extend to the club's women's team, who for the first time are able to sign their own shirt sponsor [126] Previous sponsors include Cazoo (2020–2022), SportPesa (2017–20), [129] [130] Chang Beer (2004–17) Hafnia (1979–85), NEC (1985–95), Danka (1995–97), one2one (1997–2002) and Kejian (2002–04) For the 2008–09 season, Everton sold junior replica jerseys without the current name or logo of their main sponsor Chang beer, which followed a recommendation from the Portman Group that alcoholic brand names be removed from kits sold to children [131]\n\n\nFinancial Fair Play\nIn March 2023, the Premier League referred Everton to an independent commission to investigate alleged breaches of Financial Fair Play from the 2021–2022 season [138] The investigation concluded in November 2023 that Everton breached Financial Fair Play regulations after reporting a loss of £371.8m over three years, where under Premier League rules, clubs are allowed to lose a maximum of £105m over three years [139] As a result, Everton were deducted 10 points, the heaviest punishment in Premier League history [140] At the time, Everton were on 14 points after 12 games, sitting 14th in the league table; the points deduction dropped Everton to 19th, in the Premier League's relegation zone [141] Everton said they were \"both shocked and disappointed by the ruling of the Premier League's Commission\" and had communicated their \"intention to appeal the decision to the Premier League.\" [142] Liverpool MP Ian Byrne took the 10-point deduction to the House of Commons calling for the suspension of any proceedings and sanctions, describing the deduction as \"grossly unfair\" [143]\n\n\nIn the community\nEverton's community department, Everton in the Community (EitC), is a charity that provides sports and other social activities for the local community including for people with disabilities [144] EitC represents the club in the European Multisport

[146] the Canadian Ontario Soccer Association, [147] and the Thai Football Association (where there is a competition named the Chang-Everton Cup, competed for by local schoolboys) [148] The club also has a football academy in the Cypriot city of Limassol [149] and a partnership agreement with American club Pittsburgh Riverhounds [150] [151]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nKen Loach's 1969 television film The Golden Vision combined improvised drama with documentary footage to tell the story of a group of Everton fans for whom the main purpose of life—following the team—is interrupted by such inconveniences as work and weddings Everton forward Alex Young, whose nickname was also the title of the film, appeared as himself [163]\n\n\nFilm and TV\nKen Loach's 1969 television film The Golden

different titles during the 1980s and 1990s, when many clubs each released a song to mark reaching the FA Cup Final \"The Boys in Blue\", released in 1984, peaked at No 82 [167] The following year, the club scored their biggest hit when \"Here We Go\" peaked at No 14 [168] In 1986, Everton released \"Everybody's Cheering the Blues\", which reached No 83 [169] \"All Together Now\", a reworking of a song by Liverpool band The Farm, was released for the 1995 FA Cup final and reached No 27 [170] By the time the club reached the 2009 FA Cup final, the tradition had largely been abandoned by all clubs and no song was released\n\n\nPlayers\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nFirst-team

The club was founded in 1878 and has a long and storied history in English football. Everton has won numerous honors, including nine League Championships, five FA Cups, and nine Charity Shields. The club has a strong rivalry with its neighbor, Liverpool, and the two teams contest the Merseyside derby.\n\n**History**\n\nEverton was founded as St Domingo's FC in 1878 by a group of members from the St Domingo Methodist New Connexion Chapel in Breckfield Road North, Everton. The club's first game was a 1-0 victory over Everton Church Club. In November 1879, the club was renamed Everton in honor of the local area. The club's early years were marked by a series of name changes, with the team playing under the name Everton Church Club until 1879.\n\nIn the late 19th century, Everton became a tenant at Anfield, which was owned by John Orrell. The club played at Anfield from 1884 to 1892, during which time they developed a strong rivalry with their landlord, John Houlding. Houlding eventually became the owner of Liverpool FC, which was formed in 1892 after a dispute between Houlding and the Everton committee.\n\nEverton moved to Goodison Park in 1892, where they have remained ever since. Goodison Park was the first major football stadium to be built in England and has hosted numerous high-profile matches, including a semi-final at the 1966 FIFA World Cup.\n\n**Colours and Badge**\n\nEverton's traditional home colours are royal blue shirts, white shorts, and white socks. However, the team has had a number of different kit colours throughout its history.

Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Everton_F.C.\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nEverton was founded as St Domingo's FC in 1878 [11] [12] so that members of the congregation of St Domingo Methodist New Connexion Chapel in Breckfield Road North, Everton, could play sport year round – cricket was played in summer The club's first game was a 1–0 victory over Everton Church Club [13] The club was renamed Everton in November 1879 after the local area, as people outside the congregation wished to participate [13] [14]\n\n\nColours and badge\nEverton's traditional home colours are royal blue shirts, white shorts and white socks However, during the first decades of their history, Everton had several different kit colours The team originally played in white and then blue and white stripes, but as new players arriving at the club wore their old team's shirts during matches, confusion soon ensued It was decided that the shirts would be dyed black, both to save on expenses and to instill a more professional look However, the kit appeared morbid, so a scarlet sash was added [68] When the club moved to Goodison Park in 1892, the colours were salmon pink and dark blue striped shirts with dark blue shorts The club later switched to ruby shirts with blue trim and dark blue shorts Royal blue jerseys with white shorts were first used in the 1901–02 season [68] The club played in sky blue in 1906; however, the fans protested, and the colour reverted to royal blue Occasionally, Everton have played in lighter shades than royal blue (such as in 1930–31 and 1997–98) [69] The home kit today is royal blue shirts with white shorts and socks The club may also wear all blue to avoid any colour clashes.\nEverton's traditional away colours were white shirts with black shorts, but from 1968 amber shirts and royal blue shorts became common Various editions appeared throughout the 1970s and 1980s Black, white, grey, and yellow away shirts have also been used.\n\nNickname\nEverton's most widely recognised nickname is \"The Toffees\" or \"The Toffeemen\", which came about after Everton had moved to Goodison There are several explanations for how this name came to be adopted with the best known being that there was a business in Everton village, between Everton Brow and Brow Side, named Mother Noblett's, which was a toffee shop that sold sweets including Everton Mints (a type of humbug) It was also located opposite the lock-up on which Everton's club crest is based The Toffee Lady tradition, in which a girl walks around the perimeter of the pitch before the start of a game tossing free Everton Mints into the crowd, symbolises the connection Another possible reason is that there was a house named Ye Anciente Everton Toffee House in nearby Village Street, Everton, run by Ma Bushell The toffee house was located near the Queen's Head hotel in which early club meetings took place [78]\n\n\nStadiums\nEverton originally played in the southeast corner of Stanley Park The first official match took place in 1879 In 1882, a man named J Cruitt donated land at Priory Road which became the club's home In 1884 Everton became tenants at Anfield, which was owned by John Orrell, a land owner who was a friend of Everton F.C member John Houlding Orrell lent Anfield to the club in exchange for a small rent Houlding purchased the land from Orrell in 1885 and effectively became Everton's landlord by charging the club rent, which increased from £100 to £240 a year by 1888 – and was still rising until Everton left the ground in 1892 [82] [83] The club regarded the increase in rent as unacceptable [83] A further dispute between Houlding and the club's committee led to Houlding attempting to gain full control of the club by registering the company, \"Everton F.C and Athletic Grounds Ltd\" Everton left Anfield for a new ground, Goodison Park, where the club has played ever since Houlding attempted to take over Everton's name, colours, fixtures and league position, but was denied by The Football Association Instead, Houlding formed a new club, Liverpool F.C [84]\n\n\nEarly grounds\nEverton originally played in the southeast

fixtures and league position, but was denied by The Football Association Instead, Houlding formed a new club, Liverpool F.C [84]\n\n\nGoodison Park\nGoodison Park, the first major football stadium to be built in England, was opened in 1892 [85] Goodison Park has staged more top-flight football games than any other ground in the United Kingdom and was the only English club ground to host a semi-final at the 1966 FIFA World Cup It was also the first English ground to have under-soil heating and the first to have two tiers on all sides The church grounds of St Luke the Evangelist are adjacent to the corner of the Main Stand and the Howard Kendall Gwladys Street End [86]\n\n\nEverton Stadium\nTalks regarding a new Everton stadium began in 1996 The original plan was for a 60,000-seat stadium, followed by a proposal for a 55,000-seat stadium at King's Dock, which was rejected due to funding issues [90] In 2004, Everton entered talks with Liverpool F.C about sharing a proposed stadium on Stanley Park, but negotiations broke down as Everton could not raise 50% of the costs [91]\n\n\nTraining grounds\nFrom 1966 to 2007, Everton trained at Bellefield in the West Derby area of Liverpool [94] In 2007, the club moved to the Finch Farm training complex in Halewood after acquiring it the previous year The first team squad officially moved to the complex on 9 October 2007 The training ground is now used by both the Everton men and women's first team and the youth academy [95] The training ground features 10 full-size grass pitches across three slabs, one of which is a floodlit pitch along with a synthetic pitch with additional floodlights and dedicated training areas for fitness and goalkeeping training, as well as a recreated Goodison Park pitch Within the training complex, there are changing facilities for senior players and academy players Facilities include: fitness centre, synthetic indoor training pitch, hydrotherapy pool, spa, sauna, physiotherapy room, media centre, video lounge including video editing suite [96]\n\n\nSupport\nEverton has a large fanbase, with the eighth-highest average attendance in the Premier League in the 2008–09 season [97] The club's supporters are colloquially known as Evertonians or Blues [8] The majority of Everton's matchday support comes from the North West of England, primarily Merseyside, Cheshire, West Lancashire and parts of Western Greater Manchester along with many fans who travel from North Wales, Ireland, and Scotland Within the city of Liverpool, support for Everton and city rivals Liverpool is not determined by geographical basis with supporters mixed across the city Everton also has many supporters' clubs worldwide [98] in places such as North America, [99] Singapore, [100] Indonesia, [101] Lebanon, Malaysia, [102] Thailand, India, [103] [104] and Australia [105] [106] Paul McCartney is an Everton supporter [107] The official supporters club is FOREVERTON, [108] and there are also several fanzines including When Skies are Grey and Speke from the Harbour, which are sold around Goodison Park on match days.\n\n\nRivalries\nEverton's biggest rivalry is with neighbours Liverpool, against whom the club contests the Merseyside derby The rivalry stems from an internal dispute between Everton officials and the owners of Anfield, which was then Everton's home ground The dispute resulted in Everton moving to Goodison Park and the subsequent formation of Liverpool F.C in 1892 Following these events, a fierce rivalry has existed between Everton and Liverpool, albeit one that is generally perceived as more respectful than many other derbies in English football This was illustrated by a chain of red and blue scarves that were linked between the gates of both grounds across Stanley Park as a tribute to the Liverpool fans killed in the Hillsborough disaster [110] The derby is usually a sellout fixture and has been known as the \"friendly derby\" because both sets of fans can often be seen side by side dressed in red and blue inside both Anfield and Goodison Park [111] On the field, matches have tended to be extremely stormy affairs; the derby has had more red cards than any other fixture in Premier League history [112]\n\n\nOwnership and finances\nEverton F.C is a limited company with the board of directors holding a majority of the shares [113] The club's most recent accounts, from May 2014, show a net total debt of £28.1 million, with a turnover of £120.5 million and a profit of £28.2 million [114] The club's overdraft with Barclays Bank is secured against the Premier League's \"Basic Award Fund\", [115] which is a guaranteed sum given to clubs for competing in the Premier League [116] Everton agreed to a long-term loan of £30 million with Bear Stearns and Prudential plc in 2002 for a duration of 25 years The loan was a consolidation of debts at the time as well as a source of capital for new player acquisitions [117] Goodison Park is secured as collateral On 27 February 2016, it was announced that Farhad Moshiri would buy a 49.9% stake in the club [118] On 15 September 2023, Everton announced that Miami-based 777 Partners had signed an agreement with Farhad Moshiri to acquire his full 94.1% stake in the club, pending ratification by the Premier League through the owners' and directors' test [119] The takeover collapsed as it did not meet its deadline of 1 June 2024 [120] This deal collapsed on July 19th 2024 due to issues in regards to debts to 777 partners and A-Cap Holdings [121]\n\n\nShirt sponsors and manufacturers\nSince the 2022–23 season, the club's primary shirt sponsor has been online betting company Stake.com, after the club announced the early termination of the previous deal with SportPesa in February 2020 [126] Partners with Stake became a club-record sponsorship deal [127] Ahead of the Premier League season, the Stake.com features on the front of the men's and women's playing shirts as well as appearing on screens and media backdrops at Goodison Park and Finch Farm [128] The sponsorship does not extend to the club's women's team, who for the first time are able to sign their own shirt sponsor [126] Previous sponsors include Cazoo (2020–2022), SportPesa (2017–20), [129] [130] Chang Beer (2004–17) Hafnia (1979–85), NEC (1985–95), Danka (1995–97), one2one (1997–2002) and Kejian (2002–04) For the 2008–09 season, Everton sold junior replica jerseys without the current name or logo of their main sponsor Chang beer, which followed a recommendation from the Portman Group that alcoholic brand names be removed from kits sold to children [131]\n\n\nFinancial Fair Play\nIn March 2023, the Premier League referred Everton to an independent commission to investigate alleged breaches of Financial Fair Play from the 2021–2022 season [138] The investigation concluded in November 2023 that Everton breached Financial Fair Play regulations after reporting a loss of £371.8m over three years, where under Premier League rules, clubs are allowed to lose a maximum of £105m over three years [139] As a result, Everton were deducted 10 points, the heaviest punishment in Premier League history [140] At the time, Everton were on 14 points after 12 games, sitting 14th in the league table; the points deduction dropped Everton to 19th, in the Premier League's relegation zone [141] Everton said they were \"both shocked and disappointed by the ruling of the Premier League's Commission\" and had communicated their \"intention to appeal the decision to the Premier League.\" [142] Liverpool MP Ian Byrne took the 10-point deduction to the House of Commons calling for the suspension of any proceedings and sanctions, describing the deduction as \"grossly unfair\" [143]\n\n\nIn the community\nEverton's community department, Everton in the Community (EitC), is a charity that provides sports and other social activities for the local community including for people with disabilities [144] EitC represents the club in the European Multisport Club Association [145]\n\n\nRelationships with other clubs\nEverton is connected to many other sports clubs and organisations It has links with Irish football academy Ballyoulster United in Celbridge, [146] the Canadian Ontario Soccer Association, [147] and the Thai Football Association (where there is a competition named the Chang-Everton Cup, competed for by local schoolboys) [148] The club also has a football academy in the Cypriot city of Limassol [149] and a partnership agreement with American club Pittsburgh Riverhounds [150] [151]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nKen Loach's 1969 television film The Golden Vision combined improvised drama with documentary footage to tell the story of a group of Everton fans for whom the main purpose of life—following the team—is interrupted by such inconveniences as work and weddings Everton forward Alex Young, whose nickname was also the title of the film, appeared as himself [163]\n\n\nFilm and TV\nKen Loach's 1969 television film The Golden Vision combined improvised drama with documentary footage to tell the story of a group of Everton fans for whom the main purpose of life—following the team—is interrupted by such inconveniences as work and weddings Everton forward Alex Young, whose nickname was also the title of the film, appeared as himself [163]\n\n\nMusic\nThe club entered the UK singles chart on four occasions under different titles during the 1980s and 1990s, when many clubs each released a song to mark reaching the FA Cup Final \"The Boys in Blue\", released in 1984, peaked at No 82 [167] The following year, the club scored their biggest hit when \"Here We Go\" peaked at No 14 [168] In 1986, Everton released \"Everybody's Cheering the Blues\", which reached No 83 [169] \"All Together Now\", a reworking of a song by Liverpool band The Farm, was released for the 1995 FA Cup final and reached No 27 [170] By the time the club reached the 2009 FA Cup final, the tradition had largely been abandoned by all clubs and no song was released\n\n\nPlayers\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold

{"title": "Purim", "content": "\nName\nPurim is the plural of the Hebrew word pur (loan from Akkadian puru) meaning \"lot\" [14] [a] Its use as the name of this festival comes from Esther 3:6–7, describing the choice of date:\n\n\nPurim narrative\nThe Scroll of Esther takes place over 9 years and begins with a six-month drinking feast given by King Ahasuerus of the Persian Empire for the army and Media and the satraps and princes of the 127 provinces of his kingdom, concluding with a seven-day drinking feast for the inhabitants of Shushan (Susa), rich and poor, and a separate drinking feast for the women organized by Queen Vashti in the pavilion of the royal courtyard.\n\n\nScriptural and rabbinical sources\nThe primary source relating to the origin of Purim is the Book of Esther, which became the last of the 24 books of the Hebrew Bible to be canonized by the Sages of the Great Assembly It is dated to the 4th century BCE [23] and according to the Talmud was a redaction by the Great Assembly of an original text by Mordechai [24]\n\n\nHistorical views\nThe 1st-century CE historian Josephus recounts the origins of Purim in Book 11 of his Antiquities of the Jews He follows the Hebrew Book of Esther but shows awareness of some of the additional material found in the Greek version (the Septuagint) in that he too identifies Ahasuerus as Artaxerxes and provides the text of the king's letter He also provides additional information on the dating of events relative to Ezra and Nehemiah [27] Josephus also records the Persian persecution of Jews and mentions Jews being forced to worship at Persian-erected shrines [27] [28]\n\n\nTraditional historians\nThe 1st-century CE historian Josephus recounts the origins of Purim in Book 11 of his Antiquities of the Jews He follows the Hebrew Book of Esther but shows awareness of some of the additional material found in the Greek version (the Septuagint) in that he too identifies Ahasuerus as Artaxerxes and provides the text of the king's letter He also provides additional information on the dating of events relative to Ezra and Nehemiah [27] Josephus also records the Persian persecution of Jews and mentions Jews being forced to worship at Persian-erected shrines [27] [28]\n\n\nModern scholarship views\nSince the 1890s, several academics have suggested that Purim has its origin in a euhemerized Babylonian or Persian myth or festival (though which one is a subject of discussion) [38] [39] Other scholars find these hypotheses unlikely [40]\n\n\nObservances\nPurim has more of a national than a religious character, and its status as a holiday is on a different level from those days ordained holy by the Torah Hallel is not recited [41] As such, according to some authorities, business transactions and even manual labor are allowed on Purim under certain circumstances [42] A special prayer (Al ha-Nissim – \"For the Miracles\") is inserted into the Amidah prayers during evening, morning and afternoon prayer services, and is also included in the Birkat Hamazon (\"Grace after Meals\").\n\n\nReading of the Megillah\nThe first religious ceremony which is ordained for the celebration of Purim is the reading of the Book of Esther (the \"Megillah\") in the synagogue, a regulation which is ascribed in the Talmud (Megillah 2a) to the Sages of the Great Assembly, of which Mordecai is reported to have been a member Originally this regulation was only supposed to be observed on the 14th of Adar; later, however, Rabbi Joshua ben Levi (3rd century CE) prescribed that the Megillah should also be read on the eve of Purim Further, he obliged women to attend the reading of the Megillah, because women were also part of the miracle The commentaries offer two reasons as to why women played a major role in the miracle The first reason is that it was through a lady, Queen Esther, that the miraculous deliverance of the Jews was accomplished (Rashbam) The second reason is that women were also threatened by the genocidal decree and were therefore equal beneficiaries of the miracle (Tosafot) [44]\nThe Talmud prescribed three benedictions before the reading and one benediction after the reading The Talmud added other provisions For example, the reader is to pronounce the names of the ten sons of Haman [45] in one breath, to indicate their simultaneous death An additional custom that probably began in Medieval times is that the congregation recites aloud with the reader the verses Esther 2:5, Esther 8:15–16, and Esther 10:3, which relate the origin of Mordecai and his triumph [46]\n\n\nBlessings before Megillah reading\nBefore the reading of the Megillah on Purim, both at night and again in the morning, the reader of the Megillah recites the following three blessings and at the end of each blessing the congregation then responds by answering \"Amen\" after each of the blessings [51] At the morning reading of the Megillah the congregation should have in mind that the third blessing applies to the other observances of the day as well as to the reading of the Megillah: [51]\n\n\nBlessing and recitations after Megillah reading\nAfter the Megillah reading, each member of the congregation who has heard the reading recites the following blessing [51] This blessing is not recited unless a minyan was present for the Megillah reading: [51]\n\n\nWomen and Megillah reading\nWomen have an obligation to hear the Megillah because \"they also were involved in that miracle.\" [53] Orthodox communities, including most Modern Orthodox ones, however, generally do not allow women to lead the Megillah reading Rabbinic authorities who hold that women should not read the Megillah for themselves, because of an uncertainty as to which blessing they should recite upon the reading, nonetheless agree that they have an obligation to hear it read According to these authorities if women, or men for that matter, cannot attend the services in the synagogue, the Megillah should be read for them in private by any male over the age of thirteen [54] Often in Orthodox communities there is a special public reading only for women, conducted either in a private home or in a synagogue, but the Megillah is read by a man [55]\n\n\nBlotting out Haman's name\nWhen Haman's name is read out loud during the public chanting of the Megillah in the synagogue, which occurs 54 times, the congregation engages in noise-making to blot out his name The practice can be traced back to the Tosafists (the leading French and German rabbis of the 13th century) In accordance with a passage in the Midrash, where the verse \"Thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek\" [57] is explained to mean \"even from wood and stones.\" A custom developed of writing the name of Haman, the offspring of Amalek, on two smooth stones, and knocking them together until the name was blotted out Some wrote the name of Haman on the soles of their shoes, and at the mention of the name stamped with their feet as a sign of contempt Another method was to use a noisy ratchet, called a ra'ashan (from the Hebrew ra-ash, meaning \"noise\") and in Yiddish a grager Some of the rabbis protested against these uproarious excesses, considering them a disturbance of public worship, but the custom of using a ratchet in the synagogue on Purim is now almost universal, with the exception of Spanish and Portuguese Jews and other Sephardic Jews, who consider them an improper interruption of the reading [58]\n\n\nFood gifts and charity\nThe Book of Esther prescribes \"the sending of portions one man to another, and gifts to the poor\" [59] According to halakha, each adult must give at least two different foods to one person, and at least two charitable donations to two poor people [60] The food parcels are called mishloach manot (\"sending of portions\"), and in some circles the custom has evolved into a major gift-giving event [61]\n\n\nPurim meal (se'udah) and festive drinking\nOn Purim day, a festive meal called the Se'udat Purim is held.\n\n\nFasts\nThe Fast of Esther, observed before Purim, on the 13th of Adar, is an original part of the Purim celebration, referred to in Esther 9:31–32 The first who mentions the Fast of Esther is Aḥai of Shabḥa (8th century CE) in She'iltot 4; the reason there given for its institution is based on an interpretation of Esther 9:18, Esther 9:31 and Talmud Megillah 2a: \"The 13th was the time of gathering\", which gathering is explained to have had also the purpose of public prayer and fasting Some, however, used to fast three days in commemoration of the fasting of Esther; but as fasting was prohibited during the month of Nisan, the first and second Mondays and the Thursday following Purim were chosen The fast of the 13th is still commonly observed; but when that date falls on Shabbat, the fast is pushed back to the preceding Thursday, Friday being needed to prepare for Sabbath and the following Purim festival [64] [65]\n\n\nCustoms\nIt is common to greet one another on Purim in Hebrew with Chag Purim Sameach (חג פורים שמח, in Yiddish with ah freilichin Purim (א פרייליכן פורים) or in Ladino with Purim Allegre The Hebrew greeting loosely translates to 'Happy Purim Holiday' and the Yiddish and Ladino translate to 'Happy Purim' [66] [67]\n\n\nGreetings\nIt is common to greet one another on Purim in Hebrew with Chag Purim Sameach (חג פורים שמח, in Yiddish with ah freilichin Purim (א פרייליכן פורים) or in Ladino with Purim Allegre The Hebrew greeting loosely translates to 'Happy Purim Holiday' and the Yiddish and Ladino translate to 'Happy Purim' [66] [67]\n\n\nMasquerading\nThe custom of masquerading in costumes and the wearing of masks probably originated among the Italian Jews at the end of the 15th century [68] The concept was possibly influenced by the Roman carnival and spread across Europe The practice was only introduced into Middle Eastern countries during the 19th century The first Jewish codifier to mention the custom was Judah Minz [69] Iranian Jews use traditional Persian costumes and masks [70]\n\n\nBurning of Haman's effigy\nAs early as the 5th century, there was a custom to burn an effigy of Haman on Purim [68] Prohibitions were issued against such displays under the reign of Flavius Augustus Honorius (395–423) and of Theodosius II (408–450) [68] The custom was popular during the Geonic period (9th and 10th centuries), [68] and a 14th century scholar described how people would ride through the streets of Provence holding fir branches and blowing trumpets around a puppet of Haman which was hanged and later burnt [75] The practice continued into the 20th century, with children treating Haman as a sort of \"Guy Fawkes.\" [76] In the early 1950s, the custom was still observed in Iran and some remote communities in Kurdistan [75] where young Muslims would sometimes join in [77]\n\n\nPurim spiel\nA Purim spiel (Purim play) is a comic dramatization that attempts to convey the saga of the Purim story [78] By the 18th century, in some parts of Eastern Europe, the Purim plays had evolved into broad-ranging satires with music and dance for which the story of Esther was little more than a pretext Indeed, by the mid-19th century, some were even based on other biblical stories Today, Purim spiels can revolve around anything relating to Jews, Judaism, or even community gossip that will bring cheer and comic relief to an audience celebrating the day [78] [79]\n\n\nSongs\nSongs associated with Purim are based on sources that are Talmudic, liturgical and cultural Traditional Purim songs include Mishenichnas Adar marbim be-simcha (\"When  [the Hebrew month of] Adar enters, we have a lot of joy\"—Mishnah Taanith 4:1) and LaYehudim haitah orah ve-simchah ve-sasson ve-yakar (\"The Jews had light and gladness, joy and honor\"—Esther 8:16) [b] The Shoshanat Yaakov prayer is sung at the conclusion of the Megillah reading A number of children's songs (with non-liturgical sources) also exist: Once There Was a Wicked Wicked Man, [80] [81] Ani Purim, [82] Chag Purim, Chag Purim, Chag Gadol Hu LaYehudim, [83] [84] Mishenichnas Adar, Shoshanas Yaakov, Al HaNisim, VeNahafoch Hu, LaYehudim Hayesa Orah, U Mordechai Yatza, Kacha Yay'aseh, Chayav Inish, Utzu Eitzah [85]\n\n\nTraditional foods\nOn Purim, Ashkenazi Jews and Israeli Jews (of both Ashkenazi and Sephardic descent) eat triangular pastries called hamantaschen (\"Haman's pockets\") or oznei Haman (\"Haman's ears\") [67] A sweet pastry dough is rolled out, cut into circles, and traditionally filled with a raspberry, apricot, date, or poppy seed filling More recently, flavors such as chocolate have also gained favor, while non-traditional experiments such as pizza hamantaschen also exist [86] The pastry is then wrapped up into a triangular shape with the filling either hidden or showing.\n\n\nTorah learning\nThere is a widespread tradition to study the Torah in a synagogue on Purim morning, during an event called \"Yeshivas Mordechai Hatzadik\" to commemorate all the Jews who were inspired by Mordechai to learn Torah to overturn the evil decree against them Children are especially encouraged to participate with prizes and sweets due to the fact that Mordechai taught many children Torah during this time [97]\n\n\nIn Jerusalem\nShushan Purim falls on Adar 15 and is the day on which Jews in Jerusalem celebrate Purim [60] The day is also universally observed by omitting the tachanun prayer and having a more elaborate meal than on ordinary days [98]\n\n\nShushan Purim\nShushan Purim falls on Adar 15 and is the day on which Jews in Jerusalem celebrate Purim [60] The day is also universally observed by omitting the tachanun prayer and having a more elaborate meal than on ordinary days [98]\n\n\nPurim Meshulash\nPurim Meshulash, [102] or the three-fold Purim, is a somewhat rare calendric occurrence that affects how Purim is observed in Jerusalem (and, in theory at least, in other cities that were surrounded by a wall in ancient times) [citation needed]\n\n\nOther Purims\nDuring leap years on the Hebrew calendar, Purim is celebrated in the second month of Adar (The Karaites, however, celebrate it in the first month of Adar.) The 14th of the first Adar is then called Purim Katan (\"Little Purim\" in Hebrew) and the 15th is Shushan Purim Katan, for which there are no set observances but it has a minor holiday aspect to it The distinctions between the first and the second Purim in leap years are mentioned in the Mishnah [105] Certain prayers like Tachanun, Eil Erech Apayim (when 15 Adar I is a Monday or Thursday) and Lam'nazteach (Psalm 20) are omitted during the service When 15th Adar I is on Shabbat, \"Av Harachamim\" is omitted When either 13th or 15th Adar I falls on Shabbat, \"Tzidkas'cha\" is omitted at Mincha Fasting is prohibited [106]\n\n\nPurim Katan\nDuring leap years on the Hebrew calendar, Purim is celebrated in the second month of Adar (The Karaites, however, celebrate it in the first month of Adar.) The 14th of the first Adar is then called Purim Katan (\"Little Purim\" in Hebrew) and the 15th is Shushan Purim Katan, for which there are no set observances but it has a minor holiday aspect to it The distinctions between the first and the second Purim in leap years are mentioned in the Mishnah [105] Certain prayers like Tachanun, Eil Erech Apayim (when 15 Adar I is a Monday or Thursday) and Lam'nazteach (Psalm 20) are omitted during the service When 15th Adar I is on Shabbat, \"Av Harachamim\" is omitted When either 13th or 15th Adar I falls on Shabbat, \"Tzidkas'cha\" is omitted at Mincha Fasting is prohibited [106]\n\n\nCommunal and familial Purims\nHistorically, many Jewish communities around the world established local \"Purims\" to commemorate their deliverance from catastrophe or an antisemitic ruler or edict One of the best known is Purim Vinz, traditionally celebrated in Frankfurt one week after the regular Purim Purim Vinz commemorates the Fettmilch uprising (1616–1620), in which one Vincenz Fettmilch attempted to exterminate the Jewish community [107] According to some sources, the influential Rabbi Moses Sofer (the Chasam Sofer), who was born in Frankfurt, celebrated Purim Vintz every year, even when he served as a rabbi in Pressburg.\n\n\nIn modern history\nAdolf Hitler banned and forbade the observance of Purim In a speech made on 10 November 1938 (the day after Kristallnacht), the Nazi politician and prominent anti-Semite Julius Streicher surmised that just as \"the Jew butchered 75,000 Persians\" in one night, the same fate would have befallen the German people had the Jews succeeded in inciting a war against Germany; the \"Jews would have instituted a new Purim festival in Germany\" [117]\n\n\nIn the media\nThe 1960 20th Century-Fox film Esther and the King stars Joan Collins as Esther and Richard Egan as Ahasuerus It was filmed in Italy by director Raoul Walsh The 2006 movie One Night with the King chronicles the life of the young Jewish girl, Hadassah, who goes on to become the Biblical Esther, the Queen of Persia, and saves the Jewish nation from annihilation at the hands of its arch enemy while winning the heart of the fiercely handsome King Xerxes [133]\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nExtensions of Jewish festivals which are similar to Shushan Purim and Purim Katan\n\n\nPersian(ate) Jewry\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Purim**\n\nPurim is a joyous Jewish holiday that commemorates the saving of the Jewish people from the evil plans of Haman, a royal advisor to King Ahasuerus of Persia.

The practice was only introduced into Middle Eastern countries during the 19th century.\n\n**Burning of Haman's effigy**\n\nAs early as the 5th century, there was a custom to burn an effigy of Haman on Purim. Prohibitions were issued against such displays under the reign of Flavius Augustus Honorius (395–423) and of Theodosius II (408–450). The custom was popular during the Geonic period (9th and 10th centuries), and a 14th-century scholar described how people would ride through the streets of Provence holding fir branches and blowing trumpets around a puppet of Haman which was hanged and later burnt.\n\n**Purim spiel**\n\nA Purim spiel (Purim play) is a comic dramatization that attempts to convey the saga of the Purim story. By the 18th century, in some parts of Eastern Europe, the Purim plays had evolved into broad-ranging satires with music and dance for which the story of Esther was little more than a pretext. Indeed, by the mid-19th century, some were even based on other biblical stories.\n\n**Songs**\n\nSongs associated with Purim are based on sources that are Talmudic, liturgical, and cultural. Traditional Purim songs include \"Mishenichnas Adar marbim be-simcha\" (\"When [the Hebrew month of] Adar enters, we have a lot of joy\") and \"LaYehudim haitah orah ve-simchah ve-sasson ve-yakar\" (\"The Jews had light and gladness, joy and honor\").\n\n**Traditional foods**\n\nOn Purim, Ashkenazi Jews and Israeli Jews (of both Ashkenazi and Sephardic descent) eat triangular pastries called hamantaschen (\"Haman's pockets\") or oznei Haman (\"Haman's ears\"). A sweet pastry dough is rolled out, cut into circles, and traditionally filled with a raspberry, apricot, date, or poppy seed filling.\n\n**Torah learning**\n\nThere is a widespread tradition to study the Torah in a synagogue on Purim morning, during an event called \"Yeshivas Mordechai Hatzadik\" to commemorate all the Jews who were inspired by Mordechai to learn Torah to overturn the evil decree against them. Children are especially encouraged to participate with prizes and sweets due to the fact that Mordechai taught many children Torah during this time.\n\n**In Jerusalem**\n\nShushan Purim falls on Adar 15 and is the day on which Jews in Jerusalem celebrate Purim. The day is also universally observed by omitting the tachanun prayer and having a more elaborate meal than on ordinary days.\n\n**Purim Meshulash**\n\nPurim Meshulash, or the three-fold Purim, is a somewhat rare calendric occurrence that affects how Purim is observed in Jerusalem (and, in theory at least, in other cities that were surrounded by a wall in ancient times).\n\n**Other Purims**\n\nDuring leap years on the Hebrew calendar, Purim is celebrated in the second month of Adar (The Karaites, however, celebrate it in the first month of Adar). The 14th of the first Adar is then called Purim Katan (\"Little Purim\" in Hebrew) and the 15th is Shushan Purim Katan, for which there are no set observances but it has a minor holiday aspect to it.\n\n**Communal and familial Purims**\n\nHistorically, many Jewish communities around the world established local \"Purims\" to commemorate their deliverance from catastrophe or an antisemitic ruler or edict. One of the best known is Purim Vinz, traditionally celebrated in Frankfurt one week after the regular Purim. Purim Vinz commemorates the Fettmilch uprising (1616–1620), in which one Vincenz Fettmilch attempted to exterminate the Jewish community.\n\n**In modern history**\n\nAdolf Hitler banned and forbade the observance of Purim. In a speech made on 10 November 1938 (the day after Kristallnacht), the Nazi politician and prominent anti-Semite Julius Streicher surmised that just as \"the Jew butchered 75,000 Persians\" in one night, the same fate would have befallen the German people had the Jews succeeded in inciting a war against Germany; the \"Jews would have instituted a new Purim festival in Germany.\"\n\n**In the media**\n\nThe 1960 20th Century-Fox film \"Esther and the King\" stars Joan Collins as Esther and Richard Egan as Ahasuerus. It was filmed in Italy by director Raoul Walsh. The 2006 movie \"One Night with t", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Purim\" following this outline:\n\n\nName\nPurim is the plural of the Hebrew word pur (loan from Akkadian puru) meaning \"lot\" [14] [a] Its use as the name of this festival comes from Esther 3:6–7, describing the choice of date:\n\n\nPurim narrative\nThe Scroll of Esther takes place over 9 years and begins with a six-month drinking feast given by King Ahasuerus of the Persian Empire for the army and Media and the satraps and princes of the 127 provinces of his kingdom, concluding with a seven-day drinking feast for the inhabitants of Shushan (Susa), rich and poor, and a separate drinking feast for the women organized by Queen Vashti in the pavilion of the royal courtyard.\n\n\nScriptural and rabbinical sources\nThe primary source relating to the origin of Purim is the Book of Esther, which became the last of the 24 books of the Hebrew Bible to be canonized by the Sages of the Great Assembly It is dated to the 4th century BCE [23] and according to the Talmud was a redaction by the Great Assembly of an original text by Mordechai [24]\n\n\nHistorical views\nThe 1st-century CE historian Josephus recounts the origins of Purim in Book 11 of his Antiquities of the Jews He follows the Hebrew Book of Esther but shows awareness of some of the additional material found in the Greek version (the Septuagint) in that he too identifies Ahasuerus as Artaxerxes and provides the text of the king's letter He also provides additional information on the dating of events relative to Ezra and Nehemiah [27] Josephus also records the Persian persecution of Jews and mentions Jews being forced to worship at Persian-erected shrines [27] [28]\n\n\nTraditional historians\nThe 1st-century CE historian Josephus recounts the origins of Purim in Book 11 of his Antiquities of the Jews He follows the Hebrew Book of Esther but shows awareness of some of the additional material found in the Greek version (the Septuagint) in that he too identifies Ahasuerus as Artaxerxes and provides the text of the king's letter He also provides additional information on the dating of events relative to Ezra and Nehemiah [27] Josephus also records the Persian persecution of Jews and mentions Jews being forced to worship at Persian-erected shrines [27] [28]\n\n\nModern scholarship views\nSince the 1890s, several academics have suggested that Purim has its origin in a euhemerized Babylonian or Persian myth or festival (though which one is a subject of discussion) [38] [39] Other scholars find these hypotheses unlikely [40]\n\n\nObservances\nPurim has more of a national than a religious character, and its status as a holiday is on a different level from those days ordained holy by the Torah Hallel is not recited [41] As such, according to some authorities, business transactions and even manual labor are allowed on Purim under certain circumstances [42] A special prayer (Al ha-Nissim – \"For the Miracles\") is inserted into the Amidah prayers during evening, morning and afternoon prayer services, and is also included in the Birkat Hamazon (\"Grace after Meals\").\n\n\nReading of the Megillah\nThe first religious ceremony which is ordained for the celebration of Purim is the reading of the Book of Esther (the \"Megillah\") in the synagogue, a regulation which is ascribed in the Talmud (Megillah 2a) to the Sages of the Great Assembly, of which Mordecai is reported to have been a member Originally this regulation was only supposed to be observed on the 14th of Adar; later, however, Rabbi Joshua ben Levi (3rd century CE) prescribed that the Megillah should also be read on the eve of Purim Further, he obliged women to attend the reading of the Megillah, because women were also part of the miracle The commentaries offer two reasons as to why women played a major role in the miracle The first reason is that it was through a lady, Queen Esther, that the miraculous deliverance of the Jews was accomplished (Rashbam) The second reason is that women were also threatened by the genocidal decree and were therefore equal beneficiaries of the miracle (Tosafot) [44]\nThe Talmud prescribed three benedictions before the reading and one benediction after the reading The Talmud added other provisions For example, the reader is to pronounce the names of the ten sons of Haman [45] in one breath, to indicate their simultaneous death An additional custom that probably began in Medieval times is that the congregation recites aloud with the reader the verses Esther 2:5, Esther 8:15–16, and Esther 10:3, which relate the origin of Mordecai and his triumph [46]\n\n\nBlessings before Megillah reading\nBefore the reading of the Megillah on Purim, both at night and again in the morning, the reader of the Megillah recites the following three blessings and at the end of each blessing the congregation then responds by answering \"Amen\" after each of the blessings [51] At the morning reading of the Megillah the congregation should have in mind that the third blessing applies to the other observances of the day as well as to the reading of the Megillah: [51]\n\n\nBlessing and recitations after Megillah reading\nAfter the Megillah reading, each member of the congregation who has heard the reading recites the following blessing [51] This blessing is not recited unless a minyan was present for the Megillah reading: [51]\n\n\nWomen and Megillah reading\nWomen have an obligation to hear the Megillah because \"they also were involved in that miracle.\" [53] Orthodox communities, including most Modern Orthodox ones, however, generally do not allow women to lead the Megillah reading Rabbinic authorities who hold that women should not read the Megillah for themselves, because of an uncertainty as to which blessing they should recite upon the reading, nonetheless agree that they have an obligation to hear it read According to these authorities if women, or men for that matter, cannot attend the services in the synagogue, the Megillah should be read for them in private by any male over the age of thirteen [54] Often in Orthodox communities there is a special public reading only for women, conducted either in a private home or in a synagogue, but the Megillah is read by a man [55]\n\n\nBlotting out Haman's name\nWhen Haman's name is read out loud during the public chanting of the Megillah in the synagogue, which occurs 54 times, the congregation engages in noise-making to blot out his name The practice can be traced back to the Tosafists (the leading French and German rabbis of the 13th century) In accordance with a passage in the Midrash, where the verse \"Thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek\" [57] is explained to mean \"even from wood and stones.\" A custom developed of writing the name of Haman, the offspring of Amalek, on two smooth stones, and knocking them together until the name was blotted out Some wrote the name of Haman on the soles of their shoes, and at the mention of the name stamped with their feet as a sign of contempt Another method was to use a noisy ratchet, called a ra'ashan (from the Hebrew ra-ash, meaning \"noise\") and in Yiddish a grager Some of the rabbis protested against these uproarious excesses, considering them a disturbance of public worship, but the custom of using a ratchet in the synagogue on Purim is now almost universal, with the exception of Spanish and Portuguese Jews and other Sephardic Jews, who consider them an improper interruption of the reading [58]\n\n\nFood gifts and charity\nThe Book of Esther prescribes \"the sending of portions one man to another, and gifts to the poor\" [59] According to halakha, each adult must give at least two different foods to one person, and at least two charitable donations to two poor people [60] The food parcels are called mishloach manot (\"sending of portions\"), and in some circles the custom has evolved into a major gift-giving event [61]\n\n\nPurim meal (se'udah) and festive drinking\nOn Purim day, a festive meal called the Se'udat Purim is held.\n\n\nFasts\nThe Fast of Esther, observed before Purim, on the 13th of Adar, is an original part of the Purim celebration, referred to in Esther 9:31–32 The first who mentions the Fast of Esther is Aḥai of Shabḥa (8th century CE) in She'iltot 4; the reason there given for its institution is based on an interpretation of Esther 9:18, Esther 9:31 and Talmud Megillah 2a: \"The 13th was the time of gathering\", which gathering is explained to have had also the purpose of public prayer and fasting Some, however, used to fast three days in commemoration of the fasting of Esther; but as fasting was prohibited during the month of Nisan, the first and second Mondays and the Thursday following Purim were chosen The fast of the 13th is still commonly observed; but when that date falls on Shabbat, the fast is pushed back to the preceding Thursday, Friday being needed to prepare for Sabbath and the following Purim festival [64] [65]\n\n\nCustoms\nIt is common to greet one another on Purim in Hebrew with Chag Purim Sameach (חג פורים שמח, in Yiddish with ah freilichin Purim (א פרייליכן פורים) or in Ladino with Purim Allegre The Hebrew greeting loosely translates to 'Happy Purim Holiday' and the Yiddish and Ladino translate to 'Happy Purim' [66] [67]\n\n\nGreetings\nIt is common to greet one another on Purim in Hebrew with Chag Purim Sameach (חג פורים שמח, in Yiddish with ah freilichin Purim (א פרייליכן פורים)

masquerading in costumes and the wearing of masks probably originated among the Italian Jews at the end of the 15th century [68] The concept was possibly influenced by the Roman carnival and spread across Europe The practice was only introduced into Middle Eastern countries during the 19th century The first Jewish codifier to mention the custom was Judah Minz [69] Iranian Jews use traditional Persian costumes and masks [70]\n\n\nBurning of Haman's effigy\nAs early as the 5th century, there was a custom to burn an effigy of Haman on Purim [68] Prohibitions were issued against such displays

described how people would ride through the streets of Provence holding fir branches and blowing trumpets around a puppet of Haman which was hanged and later burnt [75] The practice continued into the 20th century, with children treating Haman as a sort of \"Guy Fawkes.\" [76] In the early 1950s, the custom was still observed in Iran and some remote communities in Kurdistan [75] where young Muslims would sometimes join in [77]\n\n\nPurim spiel\nA Purim spiel (Purim play) is a comic dramatization that attempts to convey the saga of the Purim story [78] By the 18th century, in some parts of Eastern Europe, the Purim plays had evolved into broad-ranging satires with music and dance for which the story of Esther was little more than a pretext Indeed, by the mid-19th century, some were even based on other biblical stories Today, Purim spiels can revolve around anything relating to Jews, Judaism, or even community gossip that will bring cheer and comic relief to an audience celebrating the day [78] [79]\n\n\nSongs\nSongs associated with Purim are based on sources that are Talmudic, liturgical and cultural Traditional Purim songs include Mishenichnas Adar marbim be-simcha (\"When  [the Hebrew month of] Adar enters, we have a lot of joy\"—Mishnah Taanith 4:1) and LaYehudim haitah orah ve-simchah ve-sasson ve-yakar (\"The Jews had light and gladness, joy and honor\"—Esther 8:16) [b] The Shoshanat Yaakov prayer is sung at the conclusion of the Megillah reading A number of children's songs (with non-liturgical sources) also exist: Once There Was a Wicked Wicked Man, [80] [81] Ani Purim, [82] Chag Purim, Chag Purim, Chag Gadol Hu LaYehudim, [83] [84] Mishenichnas Adar, Shoshanas Yaakov, Al HaNisim, VeNahafoch Hu, LaYehudim Hayesa Orah, U Mordechai Yatza, Kacha Yay'aseh, Chayav Inish, Utzu Eitzah [85]\n\n\nTraditional foods\nOn Purim, Ashkenazi Jews and Israeli Jews (of both Ashkenazi and Sephardic descent) eat triangular pastries called hamantaschen (\"Haman's pockets\") or oznei Haman (\"Haman's ears\") [67] A sweet pastry dough is rolled out, cut into circles, and traditionally filled with a raspberry, apricot, date, or poppy seed filling More recently, flavors such as chocolate have also gained favor, while non-traditional experiments such as pizza hamantaschen also exist [86] The pastry is then wrapped up into a triangular shape with the filling either hidden or showing.\n\n\nTorah learning\nThere is a widespread tradition to study the Torah in a synagogue on Purim morning, during an event called \"Yeshivas Mordechai Hatzadik\" to commemorate all the Jews who were inspired by Mordechai to learn Torah to overturn the evil decree against them Children are especially encouraged to participate with prizes and sweets due to the fact that

between their country house—18th-century The Laines [2] in Plumpton, East Sussex [3]—and their London house in South Kensington [4] Her parents were British Army officer-turned-businessman Major Bruce Shand and his wife, Rosalind, daughter of Roland Cubitt, 3rd Baron Ashcombe Camilla has a younger sister, Annabel Elliot, and had a younger brother, Mark Shand [5] One of her maternal great-grandmothers, Alice Keppel, was a mistress of King Edward VII [6] [7]\n\n\nMarriages and children\nIn the late 1960s, Shand met Andrew Parker Bowles, then a Guards officer – a lieutenant in the Blues and Royals through his younger brother, Simon, who worked for her father's wine firm in Mayfair [29] After an on-and-off relationship for years, Parker Bowles and Shand's engagement was announced in The Times in 1973 [30] Sally Bedell Smith claimed that the announcement was sent out by the pair's parents without their knowledge, which forced Parker Bowles to propose [31] They married on 4 July 1973 in a Roman Catholic ceremony at the Guards' Chapel, Wellington Barracks, in London [32] Shand was 25 years old and Parker Bowles 33 Her wedding dress was designed by British fashion house Bellville Sassoon, [32] and the bridesmaids included Parker Bowles's goddaughter Lady Emma Herbert [33] It was considered the \"society wedding of the year\" [34] with 800 guests [32] Royal guests present at the ceremony and reception included Queen Elizabeth II's daughter, Anne; the Queen's sister, Margaret; and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother [34]\n\n\nFirst marriage\nIn the late 1960s, Shand met Andrew Parker Bowles, then a Guards officer – a lieutenant in the Blues and Royals through his younger brother, Simon, who worked for her father's wine firm in Mayfair [29] After an on-and-off relationship for years, Parker Bowles and Shand's engagement was announced in The Times in 1973 [30] Sally Bedell Smith claimed that the announcement was sent out by the pair's parents without their knowledge, which forced Parker Bowles to propose [31] They married on 4 July 1973 in a Roman Catholic ceremony at the Guards' Chapel, Wellington Barracks, in London [32] Shand was 25 years old and Parker Bowles 33 Her wedding dress was designed by British fashion house Bellville Sassoon, [32] and the bridesmaids included Parker Bowles's goddaughter Lady Emma Herbert [33] It was considered the \"society wedding of the year\" [34] with 800 guests [32] Royal guests present at the ceremony and reception included Queen Elizabeth II's daughter, Anne; the Queen's sister, Margaret; and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother [34]\n\n\nRelationship with Charles\nShand reportedly met Prince Charles in mid-1971 [46] Andrew Parker Bowles had ended his relationship with Shand in 1970 and was courting Princess Anne [47] Though Shand and Charles belonged to the same social circle and occasionally attended the same events, they had not formally met Gyles Brandreth states that they did not first meet at a polo match, as has been commonly believed [48] [49] Instead, they first met at the home of their friend Lucía Santa Cruz, who formally introduced them [25] [50] They became close friends and eventually began a romantic relationship, which was well known within their social circle [51] As a couple, they regularly met at polo matches at Smith's Lawn in Windsor Great Park, where Charles often played polo [52] They also became part of a set at Annabel's in Berkeley Square [46] As the relationship grew more serious, Charles met Shand's family in Plumpton, and he introduced her to some members of his family [53] The relationship was put on hold after Charles travelled overseas to join the Royal Navy in early 1973, and ended abruptly afterward [1] [54]\n\n\nImage rehabilitation\nFollowing both of their divorces, Charles declared his relationship with Parker Bowles was \"non-negotiable\" [79] Charles was aware that the relationship was receiving a lot of negative publicity, and appointed Mark Bolland—whom he had employed in 1995 to refurbish his own image‍—‌to enhance Parker Bowles's public profile [80] In July 1997, she was involved in a head-on car accident while driving to Highgrove House, though neither she nor the other driver sustained any major injuries [81] Parker Bowles occasionally became Charles's unofficial companion at events In 1999, they made their first public appearance together at the Ritz London Hotel, where they attended a birthday party for her sister; about 200 photographers and reporters from around the world were there to witness them together [82] In 2000, she accompanied Charles to Scotland for a number of official engagements, and in 2001, she became president of the Royal Osteoporosis Society (ROS), which introduced her to the public [83]\n\n\nSecond marriage\nOn 10 February 2005, Clarence House publicised the engagement of Camilla Parker Bowles and the Prince of Wales As an engagement ring, Charles gave Parker Bowles a diamond ring believed to have been given to his grandmother when she gave birth to Charles's mother [97] The ring comprised a square-cut diamond with three diamond baguettes on each side [98] As the future supreme governor of the Church of England, the prospect of Charles marrying a divorcée was seen as controversial, but with the consent of the Queen, [99] the government, [100] and the Church of England, the couple were able to wed The Queen and Tony Blair, along with Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, offered their best wishes in statements to the media [101] In the two months following the announcement of their engagement, Clarence House received 25,000 letters with \"95 or 99 per cent being supportive\"; 908 hate mail letters were also received, with the more threatening and personal ones sent to the police for investigation [102]\n\n\nDuchess of Cornwall\nAfter becoming Duchess of Cornwall, Camilla automatically acquired rank as the second highest woman in the British order of precedence (after Queen Elizabeth II), and as typically fifth or sixth in the orders of precedence of her other realms, following the Queen, the relevant viceroy, the Duke of Edinburgh, and the Prince of Wales Within two years of the marriage, the Queen extended Camilla visible tokens of membership in the royal family: she lent Camilla the Greville Tiara, which previously belonged to the Queen Mother, [113] and granted her the badge of the Royal Family Order of Elizabeth II [114]\n\n\nForeign and domestic trips\nCamilla's first solo engagement as Duchess of Cornwall was a visit to Southampton General Hospital; [130] she attended the Trooping the Colour for the first time in June 2005, making her appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace afterwards She made her inaugural overseas tour in November 2005, [131] when she visited the United States, [131] and met George W and Laura Bush at the White House [132] Afterward, Camilla and Charles visited New Orleans to see the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and met some of the residents whose lives were affected by the hurricane [133] In March 2006, the couple visited Egypt, Saudi Arabia and India [134] In 2007, Camilla conducted the naming ceremonies for HMS Astute and the new Cunard cruise ship, MS Queen Victoria [135] In November 2007, she toured with the Prince of Wales on a four-day visit to Turkey [136] In 2008, she and Charles toured the Caribbean, Japan, Brunei and Indonesia [137] In 2009, they toured Chile, Brazil, Ecuador, [138] Italy and Germany Their visit to the Holy See in Italy included a meeting with Pope Benedict XVI [139] They later visited Canada In early 2010, they visited Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland [140] Camilla was unable to carry out her engagements on their tour of Eastern Europe after developing a trapped nerve in her back [119] In October 2010, she accompanied Charles to Delhi, India, for the opening of the 2010 Commonwealth Games [141]\n\n\nQueen consort\nCamilla became queen consort on 8 September 2022 upon her husband's accession as Charles III, following the death of Elizabeth II [166] On 10 September, she attended the Accession Council where Charles was formally proclaimed king and she served as a witness together with her stepson William [167]\n\n\nCharity work\nCamilla is the patron or president of over 100

County Fermanagh [3] [4] Knoppane is located a few miles north-west of Roslea, a village also in south-east Fermanagh [3] [4] [6] The Finn initially flows in a mainly easterly direction from its source, flowing through the Fermanagh townland of Cornacrieve, [7] flowing past Derrygannon Community Hall, and flowing on to the east as far as the townland of Derryvollan (also spelled as Derryvullan) [3] [8] [9] The river flows around the edges of Derryvollan, separating that Fermanagh townland from Cornaguillagh, Cornacreeve and Corrinshingo (also spelled as Corrinshigo), three townlands in the north-west of County Monaghan [10] [11] [12]\n\n\nDrummully ('the Sixteen Townlands')\nThe south-western part of the Finn River cuts Drummully off from the rest of County Monaghan Drummully, also known as 'the Sixteen Townlands' or 'Coleman's Island', is a small district that is a pene-enclave of County Monaghan (part of the Republic of Ireland) almost entirely surrounded by County Fermanagh (part of Northern Ireland) Only a tiny stretch of the Finn River flows through Drummully, the river flowing along the southern edge of Annaghraw, a townland in the far south of the district All roads leading into the district of Drummully go via County Fermanagh The Cavan Road, also known locally as 'the Concession Road' [41] [42] (part of the N54 / A3), the main Cavan Town to Clones road, also runs through Drummully.\n\n\nBridges\nThe Finn River passes under numerous bridges on its way to Upper Lough Erne Most of these bridges were built in the mid- to late eighteenth century or sometime in the nineteenth century, and almost all of them are built of stone The following bridges are listed in order, going from the river's source to the river's mouth [4]\n\n\nSource to Roslea\nBetween its source and Roslea, the Finn passes under a number of bridges These include: Derrygannon Bridge, right beside Derrygannon Community Hall, [8] [9] located about 3 miles north-west of Roslea, which carries the Eshnadarragh Road across the Finn; [47] and Derryvollan (also spelled as Derryvullan) Bridge, located a few miles north-north-east of Roslea, which carries the Deerpark Road across the Finn from County Fermanagh into County Monaghan [3] [4] [13] [48] Derryvollan Bridge, which is also known as Flynn's Bridge, is located a short distance south-west of Knockatallon, a hamlet in the north-west of County Monaghan Corragunt Bridge, which does not cross the Finn, is just north-west of Derryvollan Bridge [49]\n\n\nRoslea to Cumber Bridge\nNew Bridge, a small concrete bridge built in the twentieth century, is located just over a mile south-south-west of Roslea This bridge is on the south-western edge of Spring Grove Forest and carries the Clogh Road across the Finn [14] The Clogh Road joins the Mullanahinch Road (the Roslea to Clones road) beside this bridge New Bridge is located only a few hundred yards from County Fermanagh's boundary with County Monaghan The Finn River flows into West Monaghan immediately south of New Bridge [3]\n\n\nCumber Bridge to the Derrykerrib Bridges\nAfter Cumber Bridge, the Finn flows under Annies Bridge, which crosses from County Fermanagh to County Monaghan very near the Hilton Demesne, just outside Scotshouse [2] [59] [60] Annies Bridge is almost 2.8 miles (around 4.5 kilometres) south-south-west of Clones [2] The river then flows under Ballyhoe Bridge, which is on a sideroad between Redhills and Clones and crosses the river just inside Fermanagh, not far from Clogher Market [2]\n\n\nOther nearby bridges\nThe following are bridges that do not actually cross the Finn River, but are located very near to the river They are listed in order, going from the river's source towards the river's mouth.\n\n\nCorragunt Bridge\nCorragunt (also spelled as Carragunt) Bridge crosses from County Fermanagh into County Monaghan and is located only a few miles from the source of the Finn River [3] [49] [69] The bridge does not actually span the river, being situated a short distance to the north of the Finn The bridge is just over a mile south-west of Knockatallon, a hamlet in the north-west of County Monaghan, and carries a sideroad called the Corragunt Road across a small stream This stream, which is part of the county boundary between County Fermanagh and County Monaghan, flows into the Finn River a short distance to the south of Corragunt Bridge [3] The current bridge was constructed in the late 1990s and has a Republican memorial built into it [70] [71] [72] [73]\n\n\nBallynure Viaduct\nBallynure Viaduct is located immediately south of Analore, a hamlet in West Monaghan [26] [74] This small railway viaduct, now derelict, is on the edge of the Ballynure Demesne, a former demesne that surrounds Ballynure House, which is also derelict [24] [25] The current viaduct was built in the 1920s, largely replacing a Victorian viaduct that had been built in the 1850s on the same site [74] The viaduct formerly carried the Dundalk and Enniskillen Railway across a small ornamental lake beside the main entrance into the demesne While the viaduct does not cross the Finn River, it is located very close to the river Ballynure Viaduct is only a short distance to the east of Annaghkilly Railway Bridge, the structure that actually carried the railway across the river [56] On the opposite side of the river from Ballynure are the remains of Annaghkilly Viaduct [75]\n\n\nAnnaghkilly Viaduct\nThe remains of Annaghkilly Viaduct are just west of the Finn River, being on the western side of the nearby Annaghkilly Railway Bridge [56] [75] The viaduct formerly carried the Dundalk and Enniskillen Railway across the southern part of the townland of Annaghkilly, just south-west of Analore [57] The current viaduct was built in the 1920s, at the same time as Ballynure Viaduct, on the site of an earlier viaduct [74] [75] Like Ballynure Viaduct, which is very nearby, Annaghkilly Viaduct did not cross the river Most of Annaghkilly Viaduct was dismantled shortly after the railway closed in the late 1950s Only the steel piers of the viaduct remain standing today

Nancy's Bridge was built in the late 1850s or early 1860s and carried a sideroad over the Cavan Town to Clones railway line, very near the Finn River [76]\n\n\nUlster Canal\nThe most south-western stretch of the Ulster Canal runs very close to the Finn River, from just south of Stonebridge in West Monaghan all the way to near Wattlebridge in south-east Fermanagh, with the canal running via Clones [3] [4] [77] The canal was largely built between 1830 and 1841 [78] [79] In places, the now mainly derelict and disused canal runs right alongside the river, being carried across the river on an aqueduct at one location [53] This aqueduct, which is used as a road bridge nowadays, runs from the townland of Conaghy to the townland of Gransha Beg, just south-east of Stonebridge [4] The Upper Lough Erne entrance to the canal is on a narrow channel of the lough at Edergool, a townland in the south-east of County Fermanagh that is directly opposite the townland of Derrykerrib [35] The canal entrance is right beside the Derrykerrib Bridges, being just to the north of the bridges, only a short distance to the north of the Finn River's mouth The Ulster Canal was closed in 1931 [80] [81] [82] [83]\n\n\nDrummully Church, Graveyard and Monastic Site\nOn a small hilltop overlooking the south-western end of the Finn River, very near Wattlebridge, is Drummully Monastic Site [3] [84] The site, which is in the townland of Drummully and is just inside County Fermanagh, is right beside Clogher Market, being very close to Gortnacarrow Bridge The church here was probably dedicated to Saint Mochomma originally, and was later under the authority of the Ó Gabhann (O'Gowan or Goan) dynasty, who held the hereditary position of airchinnech (erenagh) of this area in later Gaelic times [84] [85] An Early Christian site, Drummully later developed into a small monastery and parish church in the Medieval Era The church on the site was ruined by the early 1620s [84] The site has been used as a graveyard for several centuries, while what remains of the medieval church on this site has long been in ruins [64] The Parish of Drummully and the district of Drummully are named after this monastic site [44]\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Finn River (County Fermanagh and County Monaghan)**\n\nThe Finn River is a significant watercourse that flows through the border counties of County

the thirty five-year passage of time, plus the synthesis of a new story with Deckard's already-established backstory, lent context necessary to playing his aged character [41] The only other returning

ideas for the film's visual palette as Villeneuve was editing his science fiction drama Arrival (2016) [61] The sequences were then storyboarded and left for Deakins and Villeneuve to execute [61] The two were inspired by the architecture of several global cities to develop a hostile, imposing brutalist style for their fictionalized Los Angeles, among them the appearance of Beijing's cityscape in dense smog, the foothills of southern Spain, Bangladeshi shipyards, and certain mid-twentieth-century landmarks in London (such as the Barbican Estate and Trellick Tower) [68] For Las Vegas-set scenes, the filmmakers researched intense dust storms in the Sahara, Saudi Arabia and Sydney to replicate the sandy desert ruins Villeneuve sought [68] [69] [70]\n\n\nCostumes\nCostume designer Renée April produced costumes featuring fake fur, painted cotton disguised as shearling, and breathing masks [74] April initially researched the fashion styles of the 1960s and 1970s, but elected to research various decades for influence as well as both Eastern and Western culture When discussing the film, she stated she did not consider it a fashionable one \"I made costumes for the dark, wet, polluted, miserable world that Denis  [Villeneuve] created I had to hold myself back and remove anything too avant-garde or outré because it did not help the story There were no superhero suits because the world needed to be realistic, and the characters relatable.\" [75] When April discussed the film with Villeneuve about what direction she should take the costumes, Villeneuve told her \"brutal\", a similar description he gave to Gassner \"So I took it from there and made it tougher Also, we did not want to do something science-fiction We wanted to do it realistic I did not want costumes with  [lots of] zippers and plastic So my job was to make the characters believable.\" [76]\n\n\nPost-production\nWarner Bros announced in early October 2016 that the film would be titled Blade Runner 2049 [77] Editing commenced in December in Los Angeles, with the intention of having the film be rated R [78] At the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con, Villeneuve said the film would run for two hours and 32 minutes [79] An early cut of the film was four hours long, and Villeneuve described this version as \"quite strong\", but also at times \"too self-indulgent\" He said he prefers the shorter final version, which is \"more elegant\", though Ridley Scott has voiced the opinion that it is still too long Villeneuve said he will not show the four-hour cut to anyone [80] [81] As with Skyfall (2012), cinematographer Roger Deakins created his own IMAX master of the film, rather than using the proprietary \"DMR\" process that IMAX usually uses with films not shot with IMAX cameras [82]\n\n\nMusic\nRapper-producer El-P said he was asked to compose music for the first Blade Runner 2049 trailer, but his score was \"rejected (or ignored)\" [83] Jóhann Jóhannsson, who had worked with Villeneuve on Prisoners, Sicario and Arrival, was initially announced as composer for the film [84] Villeneuve and Jóhannsson decided to end the collaboration, however, because Villeneuve thought the film \"needed something different\", and also that he \"needed to go back to something closer to Vangelis's soundtrack\" of the first film [85] Composers Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch joined the project in July 2017 [86] In September, Jóhannsson's agent confirmed that he was no longer involved and was contractually forbidden from commenting [87] The musical cue during the final scene, \"Tears in the Rain\", is a call-back to the \"Tears in rain\" scene from Blade Runner which saw the death of the film's central antagonist Roy Batty The track is a reimagined version of the original Vangelis work [12] [88] Additionally, a segment from Sergei Prokofiev's musical composition \"Peter and the Wolf\" (Russian: Петя и волк) plays whenever the emanator is activated or deactivated [89]

"article": "**Blade Runner 2049**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nBlade Runner 2049 is a 2017 science fiction film directed by Denis Villeneuve and written by Hampton Fancher and Michael Green. The film is a sequel to the 1982 film Blade Runner, which was based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick. Blade Runner 2049 takes place 30 years after the events of the original film and follows a new blade runner, LAPD Officer K, as he uncovers a long-buried secret that has the potential to plunge what's left of society into chaos.\n\n**Plot**\n\nIn 2049, bioengineered humans known as replicants are still used for slave labor. K (short for serial number, KD6-3.7), a Nexus-9 replicant, works for the Los Angeles Police Department as a \"blade runner\", an officer who hunts and \"retires\" (kills) rogue replicant models. K's mission is to track down a group of advanced replicants that have escaped and are hiding in the city. However, during his mission, K discovers a long-buried secret that has the potential to change everything he thought he knew about his existence and the world around him.\n\n**Cast**\n\nHarrison Ford and Ryan Gosling were Blade Runner 2049's first significant casting choices. Gossip about Ford's participation had been circulating in the media since the project's conception, claims which the producers initially denied, having only approached the actor for a part in 2014. Alcon did not publicly announce their signing until the following year. Ford had expressed interest in reprising his role in past interviews and was enthusiastic about the Blade Runner 2049 script. The only other returning Blade Runner actor, Edward James Olmos, appears in a supporting part which pivots the main story.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe filmmakers embarked on location scouting in April 2016, and principal photography of Blade Runner 2049 commenced that July, lasting four months until November. They first toured London but found no soundstage available for the needs of the production. As a result, Deakins and Villeneuve flew to Hungary for location scouting partly due to Scott's familiarity with the country's network of facilities. They also toured Slovakia to source architectural ideas. Blade Runner 2049's production crew were mostly Hungarian, with some American staff hired to supervise the set.\n\n**Cinematography**\n\nBlade Runner 2049 is the third Deakins–Villeneuve collaboration after Prisoners and Sicario (2015).

{"title": "Crimea", "content": "\nName\nIn English, the omission of the definite article (\"Crimea\" rather than \"the Crimea\") became common during the later 20th century [citation needed]\n\n\nHistory\nThe recorded history of Crimea begins around 5th century BCE when several Greek colonies were established on its south coast, the most important of which was Chersonesos near modern-day Sevastopol, with Scythians and Tauri in the hinterland to the north The Tauri gave the name the Tauric Peninsula, which Crimea was called into the early modern period The southern coast gradually consolidated into the Bosporan Kingdom which was annexed by Pontus in Asia Minor and later became a client kingdom of Rome from 63 BCE to 341 CE.\n\n\nAncient history\nThe recorded history of Crimea begins around 5th century BCE when several Greek colonies were established on its south coast, the most important of which was Chersonesos near modern-day Sevastopol, with Scythians and Tauri in the hinterland to the north The Tauri gave the name the Tauric Peninsula, which Crimea was called into the early modern period The southern coast gradually consolidated into the Bosporan Kingdom which was annexed by Pontus in Asia Minor and later became a client kingdom of Rome from 63 BCE to 341 CE.\n\n\nMedieval history\nThe south coast remained Greek in culture for almost two thousand years including under Roman successor states, the Byzantine Empire (341–1204 CE), the Empire of Trebizond (1204–1461 CE), and the independent Principality of Theodoro (ended 1475 CE) In the 13th century, some Crimean port cities were controlled by the Venetians and by the Genovese, but the interior was much less stable, enduring a long series of conquests and invasions In the medieval period, it was partially conquered by Kievan Rus' whose prince was baptized at Sevastopol starting the Christianization of Kievan Rus' [21]\n\n\nMongol Conquest (1238–1449)\nThe north and centre of Crimea fell to the Mongol Golden Horde, although the south coast was still controlled by the Christian Principality of Theodoro and Genoese colonies The Genoese–Mongol Wars were fought between the 13th and 15th centuries for control of south Crimea [22]\n\n\nCrimean Khanate (1443–1783)\nIn the 1440s the Crimean Khanate formed out of the collapse of the horde [23] but quite rapidly itself became  subject to the Ottoman Empire, which also conquered the coastal areas which had kept independent of the Khanate A major source of prosperity in these times were frequents raids into Russia for slaves.\n\n\nRussian Empire (1783–1917)\nIn 1774, the Ottoman Empire was defeated by Catherine the Great with the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca making the Tatars of the Crimea politically independent Catherine the Great's incorporation of the Crimea in 1783 into the Russian Empire increased Russia's power in the Black Sea area [24]\n\n\nRussian Civil War (1917–1921)\nDuring the Russian Civil War, Crimea changed hands many times and was where Wrangel's anti-Bolshevik White Army made their last stand Many anti-Communist fighters and civilians escaped to Istanbul but up to 150,000 were killed in Crimea.\n\n\nSoviet Union (1921–1991)\nIn 1921 the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was created as part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic [26] It was occupied by Germany from 1942 to 1944 during the Second World War After the Soviets regained control in 1944, they deported the Crimean Tartars and several other nationalities to elsewhere in the USSR The autonomous republic was dissolved in 1945, and Crimea became an oblast of the Russian SFSR It was transferred to the Ukrainian SSR in 1954, on the 300th anniversary of the Treaty of Pereyaslav.\n\n\nUkraine (since 1991)\nWith the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Ukrainian independence in 1991 most of the peninsula was reorganized as the Autonomous Republic of Crimea [27] [28] [29] [30]  A 1997 treaty partitioned the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, allowing Russia to continue basing its fleet in Sevastopol, with the lease extended in 2010.\n\n\nRussian occupation (from 2014)\nIn 2014, Crimea saw demonstrations against the removal of the Russia-leaning Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych in Kyiv and protests in support of Euromaidan [31] [32] Ukrainian historian Volodymyr Holovko estimates 26 February protest in support of the integrity of Ukraine in Simferopol at 12,000 people, opposed by several thousand pro-Russian protesters [33] On 27 February, Russian forces occupied parliament and government buildings [34] and other strategic points in Crimea [35] and the Russian-organized Republic of Crimea declared independence from Ukraine following an illegal and internationally unrecognized referendum [36] Russia then annexed Crimea, although most countries (100 votes in favour, 11 against, 58 abstentions) continued to recognize Crimea as part of Ukraine [37] [38] [2] [39]\n\n\nGeography\nCovering an area of 27,000 km2 (10,425 sq mi), Crimea is located on the northern coast of the Black Sea and on the western coast of the Sea of Azov; the only land border is shared with Ukraine's Kherson Oblast on the north Crimea is almost an island and only connected to the continent by the Isthmus of Perekop, a strip of land about 5–7 kilometres (3.1–4.3 mi) wide.\n\n\nPlaces\nGiven its long history and many conquerors, most towns in Crimea have several names.\n\n\nCrimean Mountains\nThe southeast coast is flanked at a distance of 8–12 kilometres (5.0–7.5 mi) from the sea by a parallel range of mountains: the Crimean Mountains [40] These mountains are backed by secondary parallel ranges.\n\n\nHydrography\nThere are 257 rivers and major streams on the Crimean peninsula; they are primarily fed by rainwater, with snowmelt playing a very minor role This makes for significant seasonal fluctuation in water flow, with many streams drying up completely during the summer [43] The largest rivers are the Salhyr (Salğır, Салгир), the Kacha (Кача), the Alma (Альма), and the Belbek (Бельбек) Also important are the Kokozka (Kökköz or Коккозка), the Indole (Indol or Индо́л), the Chorna (Çorğun, Chernaya or Чёрная), the Derekoika (Dereköy or Дерекойка), [44] the Karasu-Bashi (Biyuk-Karasu or Биюк-Карасу) (a tributary of the Salhyr river), the Burulcha (Бурульча) (also a tributary of the Salhyr), the Uchan-su, and the Ulu-Uzen' The longest river of Crimea is the Salhyr at 204 km (127 mi) The Belbek has the greatest average discharge at 2.16 cubic metres per second (76 cu ft/s) [45] The Alma and the Kacha are the second- and third-longest rivers [46]\n\n\nSteppe\nSeventy-five percent of the remaining area of Crimea consists of semiarid prairie lands, a southward continuation of the Pontic–Caspian steppe, which slope gently to the northwest from the foothills of the Crimean Mountains Numerous kurgans, or burial mounds, of the ancient Scythians are scattered across the Crimean steppes.\n\n\nSouthern Coast\nThe terrain that lies south of the sheltering Crimean Mountain range is of an altogether different character Here, the narrow strip of coast and the slopes of the mountains are covered with greenery This \"riviera\" stretches along the southeast coast from capes Fiolent and Aya, in the south, to Feodosia There are many summer sea-bathing resorts such as Alupka, Yalta, Gurzuf, Alushta, Sudak, and Feodosia During the years of Soviet rule, the resorts and dachas of this coast were used by leading politicians [55] and served as prime perquisites of the politically loyal [citation needed] In addition, vineyards and fruit orchards are located in the region Fishing, mining, and the production of essential oils are also important Numerous Crimean Tatar villages, mosques, monasteries, and palaces of the Russian imperial family and nobles are found here, as well as picturesque ancient Greek and medieval castles.\n\n\nClimate\nCrimea is located between the temperate and subtropical climate belts and is characterized by warm and sunny weather [56] It is characterized by diversity and the presence of microclimates [56] The northern parts of Crimea have a moderate continental climate with short but cold winters and moderately hot dry summers [57] In the central and mountainous areas the climate is transitional between the continental climate to the north and the Mediterranean climate to the south [57] Winters are mild at lower altitudes (in the foothills) and colder at higher altitudes [57] Summers are hot at lower altitudes and warm in the mountains [57] A subtropical, Mediterranean climate dominates the southern coastal regions, is characterized by mild winters and moderately hot, dry summers [57]\n\n\nStrategic value\n The Black Sea ports of Crimea provide quick access to the Eastern Mediterranean, Balkans and Middle East Historically, possession of the southern coast of Crimea was sought after by most empires of the greater region since antiquity (Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman, Russian, British and French, Nazi German, Soviet) [60]\n\n\nEconomy\nIn 2016 Crimea had Nominal GDP of US$7 billion and US$3,000 per capita [63]\n\n\nAgriculture\nAgriculture in the region includes cereals, vegetable-growing, gardening, and wine-making, particularly in the Yalta and Massandra regions Livestock production includes cattle breeding, poultry keeping, and sheep breeding [68] Other products produced on the Crimean Peninsula include salt, porphyry, limestone, and ironstone (found around Kerch) since ancient times [41]\n\n\nEnergy\nCrimea possesses several natural gas fields both onshore and offshore, which were starting to be drilled by western oil and gas companies before annexation [75] [76] The inland fields are located in Chornomorske and Dzhankoi, while offshore fields are located in the western coast in the Black Sea and in the northeastern coast in the Azov Sea: [77]\n\n\nTransport\nIn May 2015, work began on a multibillion-dollar road-rail link (a pair of parallel bridges) across the Kerch Strait [81] The road bridge opened in May 2018, and the rail bridge in December 2019 With a length of 19 km, it is the longest bridge in Europe, surpassing Vasco da Gama Bridge in Lisbon The Crimean Bridge was damaged by an attack [82] on October 8, 2022, and another on July 17, 2023 [83]\n\n\nTourism\nThe development of Crimea as a holiday destination began in the second half of the 19th century The development of the transport networks brought masses of tourists from central parts of the Russian Empire.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, a major development of palaces, villas, and dachas began—most of which remain These are some of the main attractions of Crimea as a tourist destination There are many Crimean legends about famous touristic places, which attract the attention of tourists.\n\n\nSanctions\nFollowing Russia's largely unrecognized annexation of Crimea, the European Union, the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and several other countries (including Ukraine) imposed economic sanctions against Russia, including some specifically targeting Crimea Many of these sanctions were directed at individuals—both Russian and Crimean [89] [90] In general they prohibit the sale, supply, transfer, or export of goods and technology in several sectors, including services directly related to tourism and infrastructure They list seven ports where cruise ships cannot dock [91] [92] [93] [94] Sanctions against individuals include travel bans and asset freezes Visa and MasterCard temporarily stopped service in Crimea in December 2014 [95] [96] The Russian national payment card system allows Visa and MasterCard cards issued by Russian banks to work in Crimea [97] [98] The Mir payment system operated by the Central Bank of Russia operates in Crimea [99] as well as Master Card [100] and Visa [101] However, there are no major international banks in Crimea [102]\n\n\nPolitics\nCrimea is Ukrainian territory currently occupied by Russia; Ukraine has not relinquished title over the Crimean territory since the events of 2014, and Crimea is internationally recognized as part of Ukraine [37] [38] [2] [39] They exercise administration of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea from Kyiv in the Ministry of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy drew attention to this fact in August 2022 when he stated that it was \"necessary to liberate Crimea\" from Russian occupation and to re-establish \"world law and order\" [103]\n\n\nDemographics\nAs of 2014 [update], the total population of the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol was 2,248,400 people (Republic of Crimea: 1,889,485; Sevastopol: 395,000) [104] This was down from the 2001 Ukrainian Census figure of 2,376,000 (Autonomous Republic of Crimea: 2,033,700; Sevastopol: 342,451) [105]\n\n\nCulture\nWhat is thought to be the first work of literature in the Crimean Tatar language, a version of Yusuf and Zulaykha, was composed around the early thirteenth century, apparently by Mahmud Qırımlı [133] Alexander Pushkin visited Bakhchysarai in 1820 and later wrote the poem The Fountain of Bakhchisaray Crimea was the background for Adam Mickiewicz's seminal work, The Crimean Sonnets inspired by his 1825 travel A series of 18 sonnets constitute an artistic telling of a journey to and through the Crimea, they feature romantic descriptions of the oriental nature and culture of the East which show the despair of an exile longing for the homeland, driven from his home by a violent enemy.\n\n\nSport\nFollowing Crimea's vote to join Russia and subsequent annexation in March 2014, the top football clubs withdrew from the Ukrainian leagues Some clubs registered to join the Russian leagues but the Football Federation of Ukraine objected UEFA ruled that Crimean clubs could not join the Russian leagues but should instead be part of a Crimean league system The Crimean Premier League is now the top professional football league in Crimea [136]\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nSee

Azov to the east. It is an internationally recognized part of Ukraine, but has been occupied by Russia since 2014. The peninsula has a rich and diverse history, with various cultures and empires vying for control over the region.\n\n## History\n\nThe recorded history of Crimea begins around the 5th century BCE, when several Greek colonies were established on its south coast. The most important of these was Chersonesos, near modern-day Sevastopol. The Tauri, a pre-Indo-European people, inhabited the hinterland to the north, and gave the name \"Tauric Peninsula\" to the region, which Crimea was called into the early modern period.\n\n## Ancient History\n\nThe southern coast gradually consolidated into the Bosporan Kingdom, which was annexed by Pontus in Asia Minor and later became a client kingdom of Rome from 63 BCE to 341 CE. The Bosporan Kingdom was a powerful and influential state, known for its rich culture and trade. The kingdom was a key player in the ancient world, and its influence extended far beyond the borders of Crimea.\n\n## Medieval History\n\nThe south coast remained Greek in culture for almost two thousand years, including under Roman successor states, the Byzantine Empire (341–1204 CE), the Empire of Trebizond (1204–1461 CE), and the independent Principality of Theodoro (ended 1475 CE). In the 13th century, some Crimean port cities were controlled by the Venetians and by the Genovese, but the interior was much less stable, enduring a long series of conquests and invasions.\n\n## Mongol Conquest (1238–1449)\n\nThe north and centre of Crimea fell to the Mongol Golden Horde, although the south coast was still controlled by the Christian Principality of Theodoro and Genoese colonies.

Many anti-Communist fighters and civilians escaped to Istanbul, but up to 150,000 were killed in Crimea.\n\n## Soviet Union (1921–1991)\n\nIn 1921 the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was created as part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. It was occupied by Germany from 1942 to 1944 during the Second World War. After the Soviets regained control in 1944, they deported the Crimean Tartars and several other nationalities to elsewhere in the USSR. The autonomous republic was dissolved in 1945, and Crimea became an oblast of the Russian SFSR. It was transferred to the Ukrainian SSR in 1954, on the 300th anniversary of the Treaty of Pereyaslav.\n\n## Ukraine (since 1991)\n\nWith the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Ukrainian independence in 1991, most of the peninsula was reorganized as the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. A 1997 treaty partitioned the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, allowing Russia to continue basing its fleet in Sevastopol, with the lease extended in 2010.\n\n## Geography\n\nCovering an area of 27,000 km2, Crimea is located on the northern coast of the Black Sea and on the western coast of the Sea of Azov. The only land border is shared with Ukraine's Kherson Oblast on the north. Crimea is almost an island and only connected to the continent by the Isthmus of Perekop, a strip of land about 5–7 kilometres wide.\n\n## Places\n\nGiven its long history and many conquerors, most towns in Crimea have several names. The southeast coast is flanked at a distance of 8–12 kilometres from the sea by a parallel range of mountains: the Crimean Mountains. These mountains are backed by secondary parallel ranges.\n\n## Hydrography\n\nThere are 257 rivers and major streams on the Crimean peninsula. They are primarily fed by rainwater, with snowmelt playing a very minor role. This makes for significant seasonal fluctuation in water flow, with many streams drying up completely during the summer.\n\n## Steppe\n\nSeventy-five percent of the remaining area of Crimea consists of semiarid prairie lands, a southward continuation of the Pontic–Caspian steppe. The steppe slopes gently to the northwest from the foothills of the Crimean Mountains. Numerous kurgans, or burial mounds, of the ancient Scythians are scattered across the Crimean steppes.\n\n## Southern Coast\n\nThe terrain that lies south of the sheltering Crimean Mountain range is of an altogether different character. Here, the narrow strip of coast and the slopes of the mountains are covered with greenery. This \"riviera\" stretches along the southeast coast from capes Fiolent and Aya, in the south, to Feodosia.\n\n## Climate\n\nCrimea is located between the temperate and subtropical climate belts and is characterized by warm and sunny weather. It is characterized by diversity and the presence of microclimates. The northern parts of Crimea have a moderate continental climate with short but cold winters and moderately hot dry summers.\n\n## Strategic Value\n\nThe Black Sea ports of Crimea provide quick access to the Eastern Mediterranean, Balkans, and Middle East. Historically, possession of the southern coast of Crimea was sought after by most empires of the greater region since antiquity, including the Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman, Russian, British, and French empires.\n\n## Economy\n\nIn 2016, Crimea's nominal GDP was US$7 billion, with a per capita GDP of US$3,000.\n\n## Agriculture\n\nAgriculture in the region includes cereals, vegetable-growing, gardening, and wine-making, particularly in the Yalta and Massandra regions. Livestock production includes cattle breeding, poultry keeping, and sheep breeding.\n\n## Energy\n\nCrimea possesses several natural gas fields, both onshore and offshore, which were starting to be drilled by western oil and gas companies before annexation. The inland fields are located in Chornomorske and Dzhankoi, while offshore fields are located in the western coast in the Black Sea and in the northeastern coast in the Azov Sea.\n\n## Transport\n\nIn May 2015, work began on a multibillion-dollar road-rail link (a pair of parallel bridges) across the Kerch Strait. The road bridge opened in May 2018, and the rail bridge in December 2019. With a length of 19 km, it is the longest bridge in Europe.\n\n## Tourism\n\nThe development of Crimea as a holiday destination began in the second half of the 19th century. The development of the transport networks brought masses of tourists from central parts of the Russian Empire.\n\n## Sanctions\n\nFollowing Russia's largely unrecognized annexation of Crimea, the European Union, the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and several other countries imposed economic sanctions against Russia, including some specifically targeting Crimea. Many of these sanctions were directed at individuals, both Russian and Crimean.\n\n## Politics\n\nCrimea is Ukrainian territory currently occupied by Russia. Ukraine has not relinquished title over the Crimean territory since the events of 2014, and Crimea is internationally recognized as part of Ukraine.\n\n## Demographics\n\nAs of 2014, the total population of the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol was 2,248,400 people. This was down from the 2001 Ukrainian Census figure of 2,376,000.\n\n## Culture\n\nWhat is thought to be the first work of literature in the Crimean Tatar language, a version of Yusuf and Zulaykha, was composed around the early thirteenth century. Alexander Pushkin visited Bakhchysarai in 1820 and later wrote the poem The Fountain of Bakhchisaray. Crimea was the background for Adam Mickiewicz's seminal work, The Crimean Sonnets, inspired by his 1825 travel.\n\n## Sport\n\nFollowing Crimea's vote to join Russia and subsequent annexation in March 2014, the top football clubs withdrew from the Ukrainian leagues. Some clubs registered to join the Russian leagues but the Football Federation of Ukraine objected. UEFA ruled that Crimean clubs could not join the Russian leagues but should instead be part of a Crimean league system.\n\nGallery\n\nSee also\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nExternal links",

Crimea\") became common during the later 20th century [citation needed]\n\n\nHistory\nThe recorded history of Crimea begins around 5th century BCE when several Greek colonies were established on its south coast, the most important of which was Chersonesos near modern-day Sevastopol, with Scythians and Tauri in the hinterland to the north The Tauri gave the name the Tauric Peninsula, which Crimea was called into the early modern period The southern coast gradually consolidated into the Bosporan Kingdom which was annexed by Pontus in Asia Minor and later became a client kingdom of Rome from 63 BCE to 341 CE.\n\n\nAncient history\nThe recorded history of Crimea begins around 5th century BCE when several Greek colonies were established on its south coast, the most important of which was

southern coast gradually consolidated into the Bosporan Kingdom which was annexed by Pontus in Asia Minor and later became a client kingdom of Rome from 63 BCE to 341 CE.\n\n\nMedieval history\nThe south coast remained Greek in culture for almost two thousand years including under Roman successor states, the Byzantine Empire (341–1204 CE), the Empire of Trebizond (1204–1461 CE), and the independent Principality of Theodoro (ended 1475 CE) In the 13th century, some Crimean port cities were controlled by the Venetians and by the Genovese, but the interior was much less stable, enduring a long series of conquests and invasions In the medieval period, it was partially conquered by Kievan Rus' whose prince was baptized at Sevastopol starting the Christianization of Kievan Rus' [21]\n\n\nMongol Conquest (1238–1449)\nThe north and centre of Crimea fell to the Mongol Golden Horde, although the south coast was still controlled by the Christian Principality of Theodoro and Genoese colonies The Genoese–Mongol Wars were fought between the 13th and 15th centuries for control of south Crimea [22]\n\n\nCrimean Khanate (1443–1783)\nIn the 1440s the Crimean Khanate formed out of the collapse of the horde [23] but quite rapidly itself became  subject to the Ottoman Empire, which also conquered the coastal areas which had kept independent of the Khanate A major source of prosperity in these times were frequents raids into Russia for slaves.\n\n\nRussian Empire (1783–1917)\nIn 1774, the Ottoman Empire was defeated by Catherine the Great with the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca making the Tatars of the Crimea politically independent Catherine the Great's incorporation of the Crimea in 1783 into the Russian Empire increased Russia's power in the Black Sea area [24]\n\n\nRussian Civil War (1917–1921)\nDuring the Russian Civil War, Crimea changed hands many times and was where Wrangel's anti-Bolshevik White Army made their last stand Many anti-Communist fighters and civilians escaped to Istanbul but up to 150,000 were killed in Crimea.\n\n\nSoviet Union (1921–1991)\nIn 1921 the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was created as part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic [26] It was occupied by Germany from 1942 to 1944 during the Second World War After the Soviets regained control in 1944, they deported the Crimean Tartars and several other nationalities to elsewhere in the USSR The autonomous republic was dissolved in 1945, and Crimea became an oblast of the Russian SFSR It was transferred to the Ukrainian SSR in 1954, on the 300th anniversary of the Treaty of Pereyaslav.\n\n\nUkraine (since 1991)\nWith the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Ukrainian independence in 1991 most of the peninsula was reorganized as the Autonomous Republic of Crimea [27] [28] [29] [30]  A 1997 treaty partitioned the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, allowing Russia to continue basing its fleet in Sevastopol, with the lease extended in 2010.\n\n\nRussian occupation (from 2014)\nIn 2014, Crimea saw demonstrations against the removal of the Russia-leaning Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych in Kyiv and protests in support of Euromaidan [31] [32] Ukrainian historian Volodymyr Holovko estimates 26 February protest in support of the integrity of Ukraine in Simferopol at 12,000 people, opposed by several thousand pro-Russian protesters [33] On 27 February, Russian forces occupied parliament and government buildings [34] and other strategic points in Crimea [35] and the Russian-organized Republic of Crimea declared independence from Ukraine following an illegal and internationally unrecognized referendum [36] Russia then annexed Crimea, although most countries (100 votes in favour, 11 against, 58 abstentions) continued to recognize Crimea as part of Ukraine [37] [38] [2] [39]\n\n\nGeography\nCovering an area of 27,000 km2 (10,425 sq mi), Crimea is located on the northern coast of the Black Sea and on the

ranges.\n\n\nHydrography\nThere are 257 rivers and major streams on the Crimean peninsula; they are primarily fed by rainwater, with snowmelt playing a very minor role This makes for significant seasonal fluctuation in water flow, with many streams drying up completely during the summer [43] The largest rivers are the Salhyr (Salğır, Салгир), the Kacha (Кача), the Alma (Альма), and the Belbek (Бельбек) Also important are the Kokozka (Kökköz or Коккозка), the Indole (Indol or Индо́л), the Chorna (Çorğun, Chernaya or Чёрная), the Derekoika (Dereköy or Дерекойка), [44] the Karasu-Bashi (Biyuk-Karasu or Биюк-Карасу) (a tributary of the Salhyr river), the Burulcha (Бурульча) (also a tributary of the Salhyr), the Uchan-su, and the Ulu-Uzen' The longest river of Crimea is the Salhyr at 204 km (127 mi) The Belbek has the greatest average discharge at 2.16 cubic metres per second (76 cu ft/s) [45] The Alma and the Kacha are the second- and third-longest rivers [46]\n\n\nSteppe\nSeventy-five percent of the remaining area of Crimea consists of semiarid prairie lands, a southward continuation of the Pontic–Caspian steppe, which slope gently to the northwest from the foothills of the Crimean Mountains Numerous kurgans, or burial mounds, of the ancient Scythians are scattered across the Crimean steppes.\n\n\nSouthern Coast\nThe terrain that lies south of the sheltering Crimean Mountain range is of an altogether different character Here, the narrow strip of coast and the slopes of the mountains are covered with greenery This \"riviera\" stretches along the southeast coast from capes Fiolent and Aya, in the south, to Feodosia There are many summer sea-bathing resorts such as Alupka, Yalta, Gurzuf, Alushta, Sudak, and Feodosia During the years of Soviet rule, the resorts and dachas of this coast were used by leading politicians [55] and served as prime perquisites of the politically loyal [citation needed] In addition, vineyards and fruit orchards are located in the region Fishing, mining, and the production of essential oils are also important Numerous Crimean Tatar villages, mosques, monasteries, and palaces of the Russian imperial family and nobles are found here, as well as picturesque ancient Greek and medieval castles.\n\n\nClimate\nCrimea is located between the temperate and subtropical climate belts and is characterized by warm and sunny weather [56] It is characterized by diversity and the presence of microclimates [56] The northern parts of Crimea have a moderate continental climate with short but cold winters and moderately hot dry summers [57] In the central and mountainous areas the climate is transitional between the continental climate to the north and the Mediterranean climate to the south [57] Winters are mild at lower altitudes (in the foothills) and colder at higher altitudes [57] Summers are hot at lower altitudes and warm in the mountains [57] A subtropical, Mediterranean climate dominates the southern coastal regions, is characterized by mild winters and moderately hot, dry summers [57]\n\n\nStrategic value\n The Black Sea ports of Crimea provide quick access to the Eastern Mediterranean, Balkans and Middle East Historically, possession of the southern coast of Crimea was sought after by most empires of the greater region since antiquity (Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman, Russian, British and

development of palaces, villas, and dachas began—most of which remain These are some of the main attractions of Crimea as a tourist destination There are many Crimean legends about famous touristic places, which attract the attention of tourists.\n\n\nSanctions\nFollowing Russia's largely unrecognized annexation of Crimea, the European Union, the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and several other countries (including Ukraine) imposed economic sanctions against Russia, including some specifically targeting Crimea Many of these sanctions were directed at individuals—both Russian and Crimean [89] [90] In general they prohibit the sale, supply, transfer, or export of goods and technology in several sectors, including services directly related to tourism and infrastructure They

He is best known as the lead singer and guitarist of the rock duo The White Stripes, which he formed with his ex-wife Meg White in 1997. White is also a solo artist, and has released several successful solo albums, including \"Blunderbuss,\" \"Lazaretto,\" and \"Boarding House Reach.\" He is widely regarded as one of the most influential and innovative musicians of his generation.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJack White was born on July 9, 1975, in Detroit, Michigan, to Teresa (née Bandyk) and Gorman M. Gillis. His mother's family was Polish, while his father was Scottish-Canadian. White was raised a Catholic, and both of his parents worked for the Archdiocese of Detroit. He became an altar boy, which led to an uncredited role in the 1987 movie \"The Rosary Murders,\" filmed at Most Holy Redeemer parish in southwest Detroit. White attended Cass Technical High School in Detroit.\n\n**Career**\n\nAt 19 years old, Jack had landed his first professional gig as the drummer for the Detroit band Goober & the Peas, and was still in that position when the band broke up in 1996. He settled into working as an upholsterer by day while moonlighting in local bands, as well as performing solo shows. Although a bartender by trade, Meg began to learn to play the drums in 1997, and when she started to play drums with Jack, it felt \"liberating and refreshing.\" The couple became a band, calling themselves the White Stripes, and two months later performed their first show at the Gold Dollar in Detroit.\n\nDespite being married, Jack and Meg publicly presented themselves as siblings, keeping to a chromatic theme of dressing only in red, white, and black. They began their career as part of Michigan's underground garage rock music scene, playing along with and opening for more established local bands such as Bantam Rooster, the Dirtbombs, Two-Star Tabernacle, Rocket 455, and the Hentchmen. In 1998, the White Stripes were signed to Italy Records—a small and independent Detroit-based garage punk label—by Dave Buick.\n\n**The White Stripes**\n\nThe White Stripes' eponymous debut album was released in 1999, and a year later the album was followed up by the cult classic \"De Stijl.\" The album eventually peaked at number 38 in Billboard's Independent Albums chart. The White Stripes' music was characterized by its raw, minimalist sound, and White's distinctive vocal style. The band's success was fueled by their high-energy live performances, which often featured White's acrobatic antics and Meg's driving drumming.\n\n**Other Collaborations and Groups**\n\nRumors began to circulate in 2003 that White had collaborated with Electric Six for their song \"Danger! High Voltage.\" He and the Electric Six both denied this, and the vocal work was credited officially to John S O'Leary. Later, Dick Valentine and Corey Martin (Electric Six band members) said White was involved but not paid. White worked with Loretta Lynn on her 2004 album \"Van Lear Rose,\" which he produced and performed on. The album was a critical and commercial success.\n\n**Solo Ventures**\n\nOn January 30, 2012, White released \"Love Interruption\" as the first single off his debut, self-produced solo album, \"Blunderbuss,\" which was released on April 24, 2012. The album ultimately debuted number one on the Billboard 200 chart, and in support of the album, he appeared on \"Saturday Night Live\" as the musical guest and played at select festivals during the summer of 2012, including the Firefly Music Festival, Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, the Sasquatch! Music Festival, the Fuji Rock Festival in Japan, and Rock Werchter in Belgium.\n\nLater in the year, he headlined the Austin City Limits Music Festival. During his tour for the album, White employed two live bands, which he alternated between at random. The first, called the Peacocks, was all female and consisted of Ruby Amanfu, Carla Azar, Lillie Mae Rische, Maggie Björklund, Brooke Waggoner, and alternating bassists Bryn Davies and Catherine Popper. The other, the Buzzards, was all male and consisted of Daru Jones, Dominic Davis, Fats Kaplin, Ikey Owens, and Cory Younts.\n\n**Film and Television Work**\n\nWhite has also had a minor acting career. He appeared in the 2003 film \"Cold Mountain\" as a character named Georgia and performed five songs for the \"Cold Mountain\" soundtrack: \"Sittin' on Top of the World,\" \"Wayfaring Stranger,\" \"Never Far Away,\" \"Christmas Time Soon Will Be Over,\" and \"Great High Mountain.\" The 2003 Jim Jarmusch film \"Coffee and Cigarettes\" featured both Jack and Meg in the segment \"Jack Shows Meg His Tesla Coil.\" He also played Elvis Presley in the 2007 satire \"Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story.\"\n\n**Third Man Records**\n\nWhite co-founded Third Man Records in 2001 with Ben Swank, formerly of the Ohio-based Soledad Brothers band.

specks and hisses that will add to the idea of something beautiful, something romantic Perfection, making things perfectly in time and perfectly free of extraneous noise, is not something to aspire

Or are the White Stripes simply naïve?\" [50] Alexis Petridis, of The Guardian, said that White \"makes for an enigmatic figure Not because he's particularly difficult or guarded, but simply because what he tells you suggests a lifelong penchant for inscrutable behavior.\" [58] White himself confesses, \"Sometimes I think I'm a simple guy, but I think the reality is I'm really complicated, as simple as I wish I was.\" [58]\n\n\nPersonal life\nWhite is protective of his privacy and gives few details of his family life, even going as far as to disseminate false information [35] He states that he does not consider his personal life relevant to his art, saying \"It's the same thing as asking Michelangelo, 'What kind of shoes do you wear?' ..

He is best known for his late-night talk show, The PTL Club, which was broadcast nationally in the 1980s, and for his subsequent controversies and financial scandals.\n\n## Early Life and Education\n\nJames Orsen Bakker was born on January 2, 1940, in Muskegon, Michigan, to Raleigh Bakker and Furnia Lynette \"Furn\" Irwin Bakker. He was the oldest of four children, and his family was devoutly Christian. Bakker's parents were members of the Assemblies of God, a Pentecostal denomination. Bakker attended North Central University, a Minneapolis Bible college affiliated with the Assemblies of God, where he met his future wife, Tammy Faye LaValley, in 1960.\n\n## Career\n\nBakker began his career in Christian television in 1966, when he and Tammy Faye joined Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) in Portsmouth, Virginia. At the time, CBN had an audience in the low thousands, but Bakker and Tammy Faye contributed to the network's growth, hosting a children's variety show called Come On Over that employed comic routines with puppets. Due to the success of Come On Over, Robertson made Bakker the host of a new prime-time talk show, The 700 Club, which gradually became CBN's flagship program.\n\nIn 1973, Bakker and Tammy Faye left CBN and joined with Paul and Jan Crouch to help co-found the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) in California. However, this partnership lasted only eight months, after which Bakker and Tammy Faye left TBN due to a falling-out with the Crouches.\n\n## PTL\n\nWhile under TBN, the Bakkers moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, where in May 1973, they launched an east coast version of Praise The Lord under TBN's umbrella. Less than a year later, they formed their own non-profit organization, registered the PTL trademark, left the umbrella of TBN and the Crouches, and continued their show on 36 WRET Charlotte, 16 WGGS Greenville, South Carolina, and a few other stations. In 1975, they nationally debuted their own late-night-style talk show, known as The PTL Club.\n\nBakker founded the PTL Satellite Network in 1974, which aired The PTL Club and other religious television programs through local affiliates across the U.S. The PTL Club became a huge success, with Bakker and Tammy Faye becoming household names in the United States.\n\n## Early Investigations\n\nIn 1979, Bakker and PTL came under investigation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for allegedly misusing funds raised on the air. The FCC report was finalized in 1982 and found that Bakker had raised $350,000 that he told viewers would go towards funding overseas missions, but that was actually used to pay for part of Heritage USA. The report also found that the Bakkers used PTL funds for personal expenses.\n\nFCC commissioners voted four to three to drop the investigation, after which they allowed Bakker to sell the only TV station that he owned, thereby bypassing future FCC oversight. The FCC forwarded its report to the U.S. Department of Justice, which declined to press charges, citing insufficient evidence. Bakker used the controversy to raise more funds from his audience, branding the investigation a \"witch-hunt\" and asking viewers to \"give the Devil a black eye.\"\n\n## Sexual Misconduct and Resignation\n\nIn 1980, a $279,000 payoff for the silence of Jessica Hahn, who alleged that Bakker and former PTL Club co-host John Wesley Fletcher drugged and raped her, was paid with PTL funds through Bakker's associate Roe Messner. Bakker, who made PTL's financial decisions, allegedly kept two sets of books to conceal accounting irregularities.\n\nReporters for The Charlotte Observer, led by Charles Shepard, investigated PTL's finances and published a series of articles, which led to a subsequent investigation by the North Carolina Attorney General's office. Bakker denied the allegations of rape and misconduct, but ultimately resigned as pastor of the Heritage USA church and stepped down as host of the PTL Club.\n\n## Fraud Conviction and Imprisonment\n\nThe PTL Club's fundraising activities between 1984 and 1987 were reported by The Charlotte Observer, eventually leading to criminal charges against Bakker. Bakker and his PTL associates sold $1,000 \"lifetime memberships,\" entitling buyers to an annual three-night stay at a luxury hotel at Heritage USA during that period.\n\nAccording to the prosecution at Bakker's fraud trial, tens of thousands of memberships were sold but only one 500-room hotel was ever finished. Bakker sold \"exclusive partnerships\" which exceeded capacity, raising more than twice the money needed to build the hotel. Much of the money paid Heritage USA's operating expenses, and Bakker kept $3.4 million.\n\nBakker was convicted of mail and wire fraud in 1989 and sentenced to 45 years in prison. He served five years of his sentence before being released on parole in 1994.\n\n## Return to Televangelism\n\nIn 2003, Bakker began broadcasting The Jim Bakker Show daily at Studio City Café in Branson, Missouri, with his second wife Lori. The show has been carried on various networks, including CTN, Daystar, Folk TV, Grace Network (Canada), Daystar Television Canada, GEB America, Hope TV (Canada), Impact Network, WGN, WHT, TCT Network, The Word Network, UpliftTV, and ZLiving networks.\n\n## Prophecies and Statements\n\nIn 2013, Bakker wrote Time Has Come: How to Prepare Now for Epic Events Ahead about end-time events. Bakker has changed his views on prosperity theology, which he previously advocated for in his 1980 book Eight Keys to Success. In the book, he stated, \"God wants you to be happy, God wants you to be rich, God wants you to prosper.\"\n\nHowever, in his 1996 book, I Was Wrong, Bakker admitted that he had taken passages out of context and used them as prooftexts to support his prosperity theology. Bakker also wrote that he realized that he had only actually read the Bible all the way through while in prison.\n\n## COVID-19 Misinformation\n\nIn March 2020, Bakker sold colloidal silver supplements that he advertised as a panacea for COVID-19. The office of the Attorney General of New York ordered Bakker to cease making false medicinal claims about his supplements' alleged ability to cure the 2019–2020 strains of coronavirus.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission and the Food and Drug Administration also sent a warning letter to Bakker about his claims regarding the supplements and coronavirus.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Jim_Bakker\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nJames Orsen Bakker was born in Muskegon, Michigan, the son of Raleigh Bakker and Furnia Lynette \"Furn\" Irwin [2] Bakker attended North Central University, a Minneapolis Bible college affiliated with the Assemblies of God, where he met fellow student Tammy Faye LaValley in 1960 [3] Bakker worked at a restaurant in the Young-Quinlan department store in Minneapolis;

Moyles reprised his role as King Herod when Jesus Christ Superstar began another arena tour on 1 October 2013. Moyles also toured a solo stage show, \"Chris Moyles Live\".\n\nPresenting Style\n\nMoyles uses a zoo format, and therefore relies on his team members and audience participation for his show's games and quizzes and for other sources of comedy. He is renowned for his boorish manner, quick temper, and put-downs. It is this approach which most commonly leads to criticism of Moyles. It has also caused him to become involved in numerous controversies related to perceived offensive statements. However, Moyles generally accepts counter attacks in the same manner and routinely derides himself for being overweight and so forth, often in the lyrics of jingles. Due to his fascination with radio, Moyles regularly discusses the process of making the show, often spoofing clichéd radio practices.

The BBC was later cleared by broadcasting regulator Ofcom over the incident.\n\nPay Fracas\n\nAlongside a number of other Radio 1 and Radio 2 presenters, Moyles crossed a strike picket line in 2005 BBC staff were striking over recently announced job cuts.

Referring to his trips while filming the programme, Moyles said \"I went off to Ireland and other places to film and unlike a lot of the Who Do You Think You Are? shows I didn't go to Auschwitz. Pretty much everyone goes there whether or not they're Jewish. They just seem to pass through there on their way to Florida\". Celebrities featured on Who Do You Think You Are? including Stephen Fry, Jerry Springer and Natasha Kaplinsky, have traced their family histories back to Jews murdered by the Nazis during the Second World War.

tool used for butchering animals discovered on the Arabian coast suggests an even older habitation from 130,000 years ago [26] In time lively trading links developed with civilisations in Mesopotamia,

Sumerian sources talk of the Magan civilisation, which has been identified as encompassing the modern UAE and Oman [28]\n\n\nIslam\nThe spread of Islam to the northeastern tip of the Arabian Peninsula is thought to have followed directly from a letter sent by the Islamic prophet Muhammad to the rulers of Oman in 630 CE This led to a group of rulers travelling to Medina, converting to Islam and subsequently driving a successful uprising against the unpopular Sassanids, who dominated the coast at the time [29] Following the death of Muhammad, the new Islamic communities south of the Persian Gulf threatened to disintegrate, with insurrections against the Muslim leaders Caliph Abu Bakr sent an army from the capital Medina which completed its reconquest of the territory (the Ridda Wars) with the Battle of Dibba in which 10,000 lives are thought to have been lost [30] This assured the integrity of the Caliphate and the unification of the Arabian Peninsula under the newly emerging Rashidun Caliphate.\n\n\nPortuguese era\nThe harsh desert environment led to the emergence of the \"versatile tribesman\", nomadic groups who subsisted due to a variety of economic activities, including animal husbandry, agriculture and hunting The seasonal movements of these groups led not only to frequent clashes between groups but also to the establishment of seasonal and semi-seasonal settlements and centres These formed tribal groupings whose names are still carried by modern Emiratis, including the Bani Yas and Al Bu Falah of Abu Dhabi, Al Ain, Liwa, and the west coast; the Dhawahir, Awamir, Al Ali, and Manasir of the interior; the Sharqiyin of the east coast; and the Qawasim to the north [35]\n\n\nBritish era and discovery of oil\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries, the pearling industry thrived, providing both income and employment to the people of the Persian Gulf [47] The First World War had a severe impact on the industry, but it was the economic depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s, coupled with the invention of the cultured pearl, that wiped out the trade The remnants of the trade eventually faded away shortly after the Second World War, when the newly independent Government of India imposed heavy taxation on imported pearls The decline of pearling resulted in extreme economic hardship in the Trucial States [48]\n\n\nIndependence\nBy 1966, it had become clear the British government could no longer afford to administer and protect the Trucial States, what is now the United Arab Emirates British Members of Parliament (MPs) debated the preparedness of the Royal Navy to defend the sheikhdoms On 24 January 1968, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson announced the government's decision, reaffirmed in March 1971 by Prime Minister Edward Heath, to end the treaty relationships with the seven trucial sheikhdoms Days after the announcement, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, fearing vulnerability, tried to persuade the British to honour the protection treaties by offering to pay the full costs of keeping the British Armed Forces in the Emirates The British Labour government rejected the offer [60] After Labour MP Goronwy Roberts informed Sheikh Zayed of the news of British withdrawal, the nine Persian Gulf sheikhdoms attempted to form a union of Arab emirates, but by mid-1971 they were still unable to agree on terms of union even though the British treaty relationship was to expire in December of that year [61]\n\n\nPost-Independence period\nThe UAE supported military operations by the US and other coalition states engaged in the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan (2001) and Saddam Hussein in Ba'athist Iraq (2003) as well as operations supporting the Global War on Terror for the Horn of Africa at Al Dhafra Air Base located outside of Abu Dhabi The air base also supported Allied operations during the 1991 Persian Gulf War and Operation Northern Watch The country had already signed a military defence agreement with the U.S in 1994 and one with France in 1995 [68] [69] In January 2008, France and the UAE signed a deal allowing France to set up a permanent military base in the emirate of Abu Dhabi [70] The UAE joined international military operations in Libya in March 2011.\n\n\nGeography\nThe United Arab Emirates is situated in the Middle East, bordering the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf, between Oman and Saudi Arabia; it is in a strategic location slightly south of the Strait of Hormuz, a vital transit point for world crude oil [81]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nThe UAE contains the following terrestrial ecoregions: Al Hajar montane woodlands and shrublands, Gulf of Oman desert and semi-desert, and Al-Hajar foothill xeric woodlands and shrublands [94]\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate of the UAE is subtropical-arid with hot summers and warm winters The climate is categorized as desert climate The hottest months are July and August, when average maximum temperatures reach above 45 °C (113 °F) on the coastal plain In the Hajar Mountains, temperatures are considerably lower, a result of increased elevation [95] Average minimum temperatures in January and February are between 10 and 14 °C (50 and 57 °F) [96] During the late summer months, a humid southeastern wind known as Sharqi (i.e \"Easterner\") makes the coastal region especially unpleasant The average annual rainfall in the coastal area is less than 120 mm (4.7 in), but in some mountainous areas annual rainfall often reaches 350 mm (13.8 in) Rain in the coastal region falls in short, torrential bursts during the winter months, sometimes resulting in floods in ordinarily dry wadi beds [97] The region is prone to occasional, violent dust storms, which can severely reduce visibility.\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe United Arab Emirates is a federal constitutional monarchy made up from a federation of seven hereditary tribal monarchy-styled political units called Sheikhdoms It is governed by a Federal Supreme Council made up of the ruling Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Fujairah, Sharjah, Dubai, Ras Al Khaimah and Umm Al Quwain All responsibilities not granted to the federal government are reserved to the individual emirate [102] A percentage [quantify] of revenues from each emirate is allocated to the UAE's central budget [103]\n\n\nGovernment\nThe United Arab Emirates is a federal constitutional monarchy made up from a federation of seven hereditary tribal monarchy-styled political units called Sheikhdoms It is governed by a Federal Supreme Council made up of the ruling Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Fujairah, Sharjah, Dubai, Ras Al Khaimah and Umm Al Quwain All responsibilities not granted to the federal government are reserved to the individual emirate [102] A percentage [quantify] of revenues from each emirate is allocated to the UAE's central budget [103]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\nThe United Arab Emirates comprises seven emirates The Emirate of Dubai is the most populous emirate with 35.6% of the UAE population The Emirate of Abu Dhabi has 31.2%, meaning that over two-thirds of the UAE population lives in either Abu Dhabi or Dubai.\n\n\nForeign relations\nThe United Arab Emirates has broad diplomatic and commercial relations with most countries and members of the United Nations It plays a significant role in OPEC, and is one of the founding members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) The UAE is a member of the United Nations and several of its specialized agencies (ICAO, ILO, UPU, WHO, WIPO), as well as the World Bank, IMF, Arab League, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and the Non-Aligned Movement Also, it is an observer in the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie Most countries have diplomatic missions in the capital Abu Dhabi with most consulates being in UAE's largest city, Dubai.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe armed forces of the United Arab Emirates consist of 44,000 active personnel in the Army, 2,500 personnel and 46 ships in the Navy, 4,500 personnel and 386 aircraft in the Air Force, and 12,000 personnel in the Presidential Guard In 2022 the country spent US$20.4 billion on defense, which is 4% of its GDP The UAE is considered to have the most capable military among the Gulf states [147] [148]\n\n\nLaw\nThe United Arab Emirates has a federal court system, and the emirates of Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Ras Al Khaimah also have local court systems The UAE's judicial system is derived from the civil law system and Sharia law The court system consists of civil courts and Sharia courts Sharia courts have exclusive jurisdiction in Muslim family law matters, while civil courts deal with all other legal matters [162] Since September 2020, corporal punishment is no longer a legal form of punishment under UAE federal law Under the decree, legal forms of punishment are retribution and blood money payments, capital punishment, life imprisonment, temporary imprisonment, indefinite detention, and fines [162] Article 1 of the Federal Penal Code was amended in 2020 to state that Islamic Law applies only to retribution and blood money punishments; previously the article stated that \"provisions of the Islamic Law shall apply to the crimes of doctrinal punishment, punitive punishment and blood money.\" [162] [163] Before 2020, flogging, stoning, amputation, and crucifixion were technically legal punishments for criminal offences such as adultery, premarital sex, and drug or alcohol use [164] [165] In recent history, the UAE has declared its intention to move towards a more tolerant legal code, and to phase out corporal punishment altogether in favor of private punishment [166] With alcohol and cohabitation laws being loosened in advance of the 2020 World Expo, Emirati laws have become increasingly acceptable to visitors from non-Muslim countries [167]\n\n\nHuman rights\nThe state security apparatus in the UAE has been accused of human rights abuses including forced disappearance, arbitrary arrests and torture [196] The annual Freedom House report on Freedom in the World has listed the United Arab Emirates as \"Not Free\" every year since 1999, the first year for which records are available on their website [126] Freedom of association is also severely curtailed Associations and NGOs are required to register with the government; however twenty non-political groups were reportedly operating in the country without registration All associations have to be submitted to censorship guidelines and all publications have first to be approved by the government [197] In its 2013 Annual Report, Amnesty International criticized the UAE's poor record on human rights issues; highlighting restrictions of freedom of speech and assembly, the use of arbitrary arrest and torture, and the use of the death penalty [198]\n\n\nMigrant workers\nMigrant workers in the UAE are not allowed to join trade unions or go on strike Those who strike may risk prison and deportation, [221] [222] as seen in 2014 when dozens of workers were deported for striking [223] The International Trade Union Confederation has called on the United Nations to investigate evidence that thousands of migrant workers in the UAE are treated as slave labour [224]\n\n\nEnvironmental policy\nThe country is a leading oil and gas producer Its energy consumption per capita is around 370 Gigajoule \nThe UAE's carbon dioxide emissions per capita are high, ranking sixth among countries globally [231] \nRecently, it made efforts to make itself more sustainable Those include: [232]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe United Arab Emirates has developed from a juxtaposition of Bedouin tribes to one of the world's wealthiest states in only about 50 years, boasting one of the highest GDP (PPP) per capita figures in the world Economic growth has been impressive and steady throughout the history of this young confederation of emirates with brief periods of recessions only, e.g in the global financial and economic crisis years 2008–09, and a couple of more mixed years starting in 2015 and persisting until 2019 Between 2000 and 2018, average real gross domestic product (GDP) growth was at close to 4% [235] It is the second largest economy in the GCC (after Saudi Arabia), [236] with a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of US$414.2 billion, and a real GDP of 392.8 billion constant 2010 USD in 2018 [235] Since its independence in 1971, the UAE's economy has grown by nearly 231 times to 1.45 trillion AED in 2013 The non-oil trade has grown to 1.2 trillion AED, a growth by around 28 times from 1981 to 2012 [236] Supported by the world's seventh-largest oil reserves and aided by prudent investments coupled with a resolute commitment to economic liberalism and strong governmental oversight, the UAE has witnessed its real GDP increase by more than three times over the past four decades Presently, the UAE is among the wealthiest countries globally, with GDP per capita nearly 80% higher than the OECD average [235]\n\n\nBusiness and finance\nThe UAE offers businesses a strong enabling environment: stable political and macroeconomic conditions, a future-oriented government, good general infrastructure and ICT infrastructure Moreover, the country has made continuous and convincing improvements to its regulatory environment [235] and is ranked as the 26th best country in the world for doing business by the Doing Business 2017 Report published by the World Bank Group [237] The UAE are in the top ranks of several other global indices, such as the World Economic Forum's (WEF), Global Competitiveness Index (GCI), the World Happiness Report (WHR) and 32nd in the Global Innovation Index in 2024 [238] The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), for example, assigns the UAE rank two regionally in terms of business environment and 22 worldwide From the 2018 Arab Youth Survey the UAE emerges as the top Arab country in areas such as living, safety and security, economic opportunities, and starting a business, and as an example for other states to emulate [235]\n\n\nVAT\nThe UAE government implemented value-added tax (VAT) in the country from January 1, 2018, at a standard rate of 5% [247]\nWhile the government may still adjust the exact arrangement of the VAT, it is not likely that any new taxes will be introduced in the foreseeable future Additional taxes would destroy one of the UAE's main enticements for businesses to operate in the country and put a heavy burden on the economy [235]\n\n\nEnergy\nOil and gas production is an important part of the economy of the UAE In 2018, the oil and gas sector contributed 26% to overall GDP \nThe UAE leadership initiated economic diversification efforts even before the oil price crash in the 1980s, resulting in the UAE having the most diversified economy in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region at present Although the oil and gas sector continues to be significant to the UAE economy, these efforts have yielded great resilience during periods of oil price fluctuations and economic turbulence.\nThe introduction of the VAT has provided the government with an additional source of income – approximately 6% of the total revenue in 2018, or 27 billion United Arab Emirates dirham (AED) – affording its fiscal policy more independence from oil- and gas-related revenue, which constitutes about 36% of the total government revenue.\n\n\nTourism\nTourism acts as a growth sector for the entire UAE economy Dubai is the top tourism destination in the Middle East [185] According to the annual MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index, Dubai is the fifth most popular tourism destination in the world [251] Dubai holds up to 66% share of the UAE's tourism economy, with Abu Dhabi having 16% and Sharjah 10% Dubai welcomed 10 million tourists in 2013.\n\n\nTransport\nDubai International Airport became the busiest airport in the world by international passenger traffic in 2014, overtaking London Heathrow [259] Abu Dhabi International Airport is the second-largest airport in the UAE Due to the announced expansion of Al Maktoum Airport on 28 April 2024, Dubai International Airport will be shut down once Al Maktoum Airport expansion will be completed [260]\n\n\nTelecommunications\nThe United Arab Emirates is served by two telecommunications operators, Etisalat and Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company (\"du\") Etisalat operated a monopoly until du launched mobile services in February 2007 [267] Internet subscribers were expected to increase from 0.904 million in 2007 to 2.66 million in 2012 [268] The regulator, the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority, mandates filtering websites for religious, political and sexual content [269]\n\n\nCompetitiveness\nIn June 2024 it was reported, that the UAE has moved up three place to the 7th place among the top 10 countries in the IMD World Competitiveness This ranking is issued by the World Competitiveness Centre of the Institute for Management Development (IMD) in Switzerland [271]\n\n\nDemographics\nAccording to an estimate by the World Bank, the UAE's population in 2020 was 9,890,400 Immigrants accounted for 88.52% while Emiratis made up the remaining 11.48% [272] This unique imbalance is due to the country's exceptionally high net migration rate of 21.71, the world's highest [273] UAE citizenship is very difficult to obtain other than by filiation and only granted under very special circumstances [274]\n\n\nLargest cities\nModern Standard Arabic is the national language of the United Arab Emirates English is the most commonly spoken language, [2] [3] whereas Emirati Arabic, a variety of Gulf Arabic, is spoken natively by Emirati people [284]\n\n\nLanguage\nModern Standard Arabic is the national language of the United Arab Emirates English is the most commonly spoken language, [2] [3] whereas Emirati Arabic, a variety of Gulf Arabic, is spoken natively by Emirati people [284]\n\n\nReligion\nIslam is the largest and the official state religion of the United Arab Emirates The government follows a policy of tolerance toward other religions and rarely interferes in the religious activities of non-Muslims [285]\n\n\nEducation\nThe education system through secondary level administered by the Ministry of Education in all emirates except Abu Dhabi, where it falls under the authority of the Department of Education and Knowledge Public schools are divided into primary schools, middle schools and high schools The public schools are government-funded and the curriculum is created to match the United Arab Emirates' development goals The medium of instruction in the public school is Arabic with emphasis on English as a second language There are also many private schools which are internationally accredited Public schools in the country are free for citizens of the UAE, while the fees for private schools vary.\n\n\nHealth\nThe life expectancy at birth in the UAE is at 76.96 years [307] Cardiovascular disease is the principal cause of death in the UAE, constituting 28% of total deaths; other major causes are accidents and injuries, malignancies, and congenital anomalies [308] According to World Health Organization data from 2016, 34.5% of adults in the UAE are clinically obese, with a body mass index (BMI) score of 30 or more [309]\n\n\nCulture\nEmirati culture is based on Arabian culture and has been influenced by the cultures of Persia, India, and East Africa [313] Arabian and Arabian inspired architecture is part of the expression of the local Emirati identity [314] Arabian influence on Emirati culture is noticeably visible in traditional Emirati architecture and folk arts [313] For example, the distinctive wind tower that tops traditional Emirati buildings, the barjeel, has become an identifying mark of Emirati architecture and is attributed to Arabian influence [313] This influence is derived both from traders who fled the tax regime in Persia in the early 19th century and from Emirati ownership of ports on the Arabian coast, for instance the Al Qassimi port of Lingeh [315]\n\n\nMedia\nThe UAE's media is annually classified as \"not free\" in the Freedom of the Press report by Freedom House [327] The UAE ranks poorly in the annual Press Freedom Index by Reporters without Borders Dubai Media City is the UAE's main media zone The UAE is home to some pan-Arab broadcasters, including the Middle East Broadcasting Centre and Orbit Showtime Network In 2007, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum decreed that journalists can no longer be prosecuted or imprisoned for reasons relating to their work [328] At the same time, the UAE has made it illegal to disseminate online material that can threaten \"public order\", [329] and hands down prison terms for those who \"deride or damage\" the reputation of the state and \"display contempt\" for religion Journalists who are arrested for violating this law are often brutally beaten by the police [330]\n\n\nCuisine\nThe traditional food of the Emirates has always been rice, fish, and meat The people of the United Arab Emirates have adopted most of their foods from other West and South Asian countries including Iran, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Pakistan and India Seafood has been the mainstay of the Emirati diet for centuries Meat and rice are other staple foods, with lamb and mutton preferred to goat and beef Popular beverages are coffee and tea, which can be complemented with cardamom or saffron to give them a distinctive flavour [335]\n\n\nSports\nFormula One is particularly popular in the United Arab Emirates, and a Grand Prix is annually held at the Yas Marina Circuit in Yas Island in Abu Dhabi The race takes place in the evening, and was the first ever Grand Prix to start in daylight and finish at night [339] Other popular sports include camel racing, falconry, endurance riding, and tennis [340] The emirate of Dubai is also home to two major golf courses: the Dubai Golf Club and Emirates Golf Club.\n\n\nFootball\nFootball is a popular sport in the UAE Al Nasr, Al Ain, Al Wasl, Sharjah, Al Wahda, and Shabab Al Ahli are the most popular teams and enjoy the reputation of long-time regional champions [343] The United Arab Emirates Football Association was established in 1971 and since then has dedicated its time and effort to promoting the game, organising youth programmes and improving the abilities of not only its players, but also the officials and coaches involved with its regional teams The UAE qualified for the FIFA World Cup in 1990, along with Egypt It was the third consecutive World Cup with two Arab nations qualifying, after Kuwait and Algeria in 1982, and Iraq and Algeria again in 1986 The UAE has won the Gulf Cup Championship twice: the first cup won in January 2007 held in Abu Dhabi and the second in January 2013, held in Bahrain [344] The country hosted the 2019 AFC Asian Cup The UAE team went all the way to the semi-finals, where they were defeated by the eventual champions, Qatar.\n\n\nCricket\nCricket is one of the most popular sports in the UAE, largely because of the expatriate population from the SAARC countries, the United Kingdom, and Australia The headquarters of the International Cricket Council (ICC) have been located in the Dubai Sports City complex since 2005, including the ICC Academy which was established in 2009 [345] There are a number of international cricket venues in the UAE, which are frequently used for international tournaments and \"neutral\" bilateral series due to the local climate and Dubai's status as a transport hub Notable international tournaments hosted by the UAE have included the 2014 Under-19 Cricket World Cup, the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup, and three editions of the Asia Cup (1984, 1995 and 2018) Notable grounds include the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium in Sharjah, [346] Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi, and Dubai International Cricket Stadium in Dubai [347]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nFurther

the Indus Valley This contact persisted and became wider, probably motivated by the trade in copper from the Hajar Mountains, which commenced around 3,000 BCE [27] Sumerian sources talk of the Magan civilisation, which has been identified as encompassing the modern UAE and Oman [28]\n\n\nAntiquity\nStone tools recovered reveal a settlement of people from Africa some 127,000 years ago and a stone

Sumerian sources talk of the Magan civilisation, which has been identified as encompassing the modern UAE and Oman [28]\n\n\nIslam\nThe spread of Islam to the northeastern tip of the Arabian Peninsula is thought to have followed directly from a letter sent by the Islamic prophet Muhammad to the rulers of Oman in 630 CE This led to a group of rulers travelling to Medina, converting to Islam and subsequently driving a successful uprising against the unpopular Sassanids, who dominated the coast at the time [29] Following the death of Muhammad, the new Islamic communities south of the Persian Gulf threatened to disintegrate, with insurrections against the Muslim leaders Caliph Abu Bakr sent an army from the capital Medina which completed its reconquest of the territory (the Ridda Wars) with the Battle of Dibba in which 10,000 lives are thought to have been lost [30] This assured the integrity of the Caliphate and the unification of the Arabian Peninsula under the newly emerging Rashidun Caliphate.\n\n\nPortuguese era\nThe harsh desert environment led to the emergence of the \"versatile tribesman\", nomadic groups who subsisted due to a variety of economic activities, including animal husbandry, agriculture and hunting The seasonal movements of these groups led not only to frequent clashes between groups but also to the establishment of seasonal and semi-seasonal settlements and centres These formed tribal groupings whose names are still carried by modern Emiratis, including the Bani Yas and Al Bu Falah of Abu Dhabi, Al Ain, Liwa, and the west coast; the Dhawahir, Awamir, Al Ali, and Manasir of the interior; the Sharqiyin of the east coast; and the Qawasim to the north [35]\n\n\nBritish era and discovery of oil\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries, the pearling industry thrived, providing both income and employment to the people of the Persian Gulf [47] The First World War had a severe impact on the industry, but it was the economic depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s, coupled with the invention of the cultured pearl, that wiped out the trade The remnants of the trade eventually faded away shortly after the Second World War, when the newly independent Government of India imposed heavy taxation on imported pearls The decline of pearling resulted in extreme economic hardship in the Trucial States [48]\n\n\nIndependence\nBy 1966, it had become clear the British government could no longer afford to administer and protect the Trucial States, what is now the United Arab Emirates British Members of Parliament (MPs) debated the preparedness of the Royal Navy to defend the sheikhdoms On 24 January 1968, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson announced the government's decision, reaffirmed in March 1971 by Prime Minister Edward Heath, to end the treaty relationships with the seven trucial sheikhdoms Days after the announcement, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, fearing vulnerability, tried to persuade the British to honour the protection treaties by offering to pay the full costs of keeping the British Armed Forces in the Emirates The British Labour government rejected the offer [60] After Labour MP Goronwy Roberts informed Sheikh Zayed of the news of British withdrawal, the nine Persian Gulf sheikhdoms attempted to form a union of Arab emirates, but by mid-1971 they were still unable to agree on terms of union even though the British treaty relationship was to expire in December of that year [61]\n\n\nPost-Independence period\nThe UAE supported military operations by the US and other coalition states engaged in the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan (2001) and Saddam Hussein in Ba'athist Iraq (2003) as well as operations supporting the Global War on Terror for the Horn of Africa at Al Dhafra Air Base located outside of Abu Dhabi The air base also supported Allied operations during the 1991 Persian Gulf War and Operation Northern Watch The country had already signed a military defence agreement with the U.S in 1994 and one with France in 1995 [68] [69] In January 2008, France and the UAE signed a deal allowing France to set up a permanent military base in the emirate of Abu Dhabi [70] The UAE joined international military operations in Libya in March 2011.\n\n\nGeography\nThe United Arab Emirates is situated in the Middle

average maximum temperatures reach above 45 °C (113 °F) on the coastal plain In the Hajar Mountains, temperatures are considerably lower, a result of increased elevation [95] Average minimum temperatures in January and February are between 10 and 14 °C (50 and 57 °F) [96] During the late summer months, a humid southeastern wind known as Sharqi (i.e \"Easterner\") makes the coastal region especially unpleasant The average annual rainfall in the coastal area is less than 120 mm (4.7 in), but in some mountainous areas annual rainfall often reaches 350 mm (13.8 in) Rain in the coastal region falls in short, torrential bursts during the winter months, sometimes resulting in floods in ordinarily dry wadi beds [97] The region is prone to occasional, violent dust storms, which can severely reduce visibility.\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe United Arab Emirates is a federal constitutional monarchy made up from a federation of seven hereditary tribal monarchy-styled political units called Sheikhdoms It is governed by a Federal Supreme Council made up of the ruling Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Fujairah, Sharjah, Dubai, Ras Al Khaimah and Umm Al Quwain All responsibilities not granted to the federal government are reserved to the individual emirate [102] A percentage [quantify] of revenues from each emirate is allocated to the UAE's central budget

federal court system, and the emirates of Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Ras Al Khaimah also have local court systems The UAE's judicial system is derived from the civil law system and Sharia law The court system consists of civil courts and Sharia courts Sharia courts have exclusive jurisdiction in Muslim family law matters, while civil courts deal with all other legal matters [162] Since September 2020, corporal punishment is no longer a legal form of punishment under UAE federal law Under the decree, legal forms of punishment are retribution and blood money payments, capital punishment, life imprisonment, temporary imprisonment, indefinite detention, and fines [162] Article 1 of the Federal Penal Code was amended in 2020 to state that Islamic Law applies only to retribution and blood money punishments; previously the article stated that \"provisions of the Islamic Law shall apply to the crimes of doctrinal punishment, punitive punishment and blood money.\" [162] [163] Before 2020, flogging, stoning, amputation, and crucifixion were technically legal punishments for criminal offences such as adultery, premarital sex, and drug or alcohol use [164] [165] In recent history, the UAE has declared its intention to move towards a more tolerant legal code, and to phase out corporal punishment altogether in favor of private punishment [166] With alcohol and cohabitation laws being loosened in advance of the 2020 World Expo, Emirati laws have become increasingly acceptable to visitors from non-Muslim countries [167]\n\n\nHuman rights\nThe state security apparatus in the UAE has been accused of human rights abuses including forced disappearance, arbitrary arrests and torture [196] The annual Freedom House report on Freedom in the World has listed the United Arab Emirates as \"Not Free\" every year since 1999, the first year for which records are available on their website [126] Freedom of association is also severely curtailed Associations and NGOs are required to register with the government; however twenty non-political groups were reportedly operating in the country without registration All associations have to be submitted to censorship guidelines and all publications have first to be approved by the government [197] In its 2013 Annual Report, Amnesty International criticized the UAE's poor record on human rights issues; highlighting restrictions of freedom of speech and assembly, the use of arbitrary arrest and torture, and the use of the death penalty [198]\n\n\nMigrant workers\nMigrant workers in the UAE are not allowed to join trade unions or go on strike Those who strike may risk prison and deportation, [221] [222] as seen in 2014 when dozens of workers were deported for striking [223] The International Trade Union Confederation has called on the United Nations to investigate evidence that thousands of migrant workers in the UAE are treated as slave labour [224]\n\n\nEnvironmental policy\nThe country is a leading oil and gas producer Its energy consumption per capita is around 370 Gigajoule \nThe UAE's carbon dioxide emissions per capita are high, ranking sixth among countries globally [231] \nRecently, it made efforts to

periods of recessions only, e.g in the global financial and economic crisis years 2008–09, and a couple of more mixed years starting in 2015 and persisting until 2019 Between 2000 and 2018, average real gross domestic product (GDP) growth was at close to 4% [235] It is the second largest economy in the GCC (after Saudi Arabia), [236] with a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of US$414.2

has grown to 1.2 trillion AED, a growth by around 28 times from 1981 to 2012 [236] Supported by the world's seventh-largest oil reserves and aided by prudent investments coupled with a resolute commitment to economic liberalism and strong governmental oversight, the UAE has witnessed its real GDP increase by more than three times over the past four decades Presently, the UAE is among the wealthiest countries globally, with GDP per capita nearly 80% higher than the OECD average [235]\n\n\nBusiness and finance\nThe UAE offers businesses a strong enabling environment: stable political and macroeconomic conditions, a future-oriented government, good general infrastructure and ICT infrastructure Moreover, the country has made continuous and convincing improvements to its regulatory environment [235] and is ranked as the 26th best country in the world for doing business by the Doing Business 2017 Report published by the World Bank Group [237] The UAE are in the top ranks of several other global indices, such as the World Economic Forum's (WEF), Global Competitiveness Index (GCI), the World Happiness Report (WHR) and 32nd in the Global Innovation Index in 2024 [238] The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), for example, assigns the UAE rank two regionally in terms of business environment and 22 worldwide From the 2018 Arab Youth Survey the UAE emerges as the top Arab country in areas such as living, safety and security, economic opportunities, and starting a business, and as an example for other states to emulate [235]\n\n\nVAT\nThe UAE government implemented value-added tax (VAT) in the country from January 1, 2018, at a standard rate of 5% [247]\nWhile the government may still adjust the exact arrangement of the VAT, it is not likely that any new taxes will be introduced in the foreseeable future Additional taxes would destroy one of the UAE's main enticements for businesses to operate in the country and put a heavy burden on the economy [235]\n\n\nEnergy\nOil and gas production is an important part of the economy of the UAE In 2018, the oil and gas sector contributed 26% to overall GDP \nThe UAE leadership initiated economic diversification efforts even before the oil price crash in the 1980s, resulting in the UAE having the most diversified economy in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region at present Although the oil and gas sector continues to be significant to the UAE economy, these efforts have yielded great resilience during periods of oil price fluctuations and economic turbulence.\nThe introduction of the VAT has provided the government with an additional source of income – approximately 6% of the total revenue in 2018, or 27 billion United Arab Emirates dirham (AED) – affording its fiscal policy more independence from oil- and gas-related revenue, which constitutes about 36% of the total government revenue.\n\n\nTourism\nTourism acts as a growth sector for the entire UAE economy Dubai is the top tourism destination in the Middle East [185] According to the annual MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index, Dubai is the fifth most popular tourism destination in the world [251] Dubai holds up to 66% share of the UAE's tourism economy, with Abu Dhabi having 16% and Sharjah 10% Dubai welcomed 10 million tourists in 2013.\n\n\nTransport\nDubai International Airport became the busiest airport in the world by international passenger traffic in 2014, overtaking London Heathrow [259] Abu Dhabi International Airport is the second-largest airport in the UAE Due to the announced expansion of Al Maktoum Airport on 28 April 2024, Dubai International Airport will be shut down once Al Maktoum Airport expansion will be completed [260]\n\n\nTelecommunications\nThe United Arab Emirates is served by two telecommunications operators, Etisalat and Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company (\"du\") Etisalat operated a monopoly until du launched mobile services in February 2007 [267] Internet subscribers were expected to increase from 0.904 million in 2007 to 2.66 million in 2012 [268] The regulator, the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority, mandates filtering websites for religious, political and sexual content [269]\n\n\nCompetitiveness\nIn June 2024 it was reported, that the UAE has moved up three place to the 7th place among the top 10 countries in the IMD World Competitiveness This ranking is issued by the World Competitiveness Centre of the Institute for Management Development (IMD) in Switzerland [271]\n\n\nDemographics\nAccording to an estimate by the World Bank, the UAE's population in 2020 was 9,890,400 Immigrants accounted for 88.52% while Emiratis made up the remaining 11.48% [272] This unique imbalance is due to the country's exceptionally high net migration rate of 21.71, the world's highest [273] UAE citizenship is very difficult to obtain other than by filiation and only granted under very special circumstances [274]\n\n\nLargest cities\nModern Standard Arabic is the national language of the United Arab Emirates English is the most commonly spoken language, [2] [3] whereas Emirati Arabic, a variety of Gulf Arabic, is spoken natively by Emirati people [284]\n\n\nLanguage\nModern Standard Arabic is the national language of the United Arab Emirates English is the most commonly spoken language, [2] [3] whereas Emirati Arabic, a variety of Gulf Arabic, is spoken natively by Emirati people [284]\n\n\nReligion\nIslam is the largest and the official state religion of the United Arab Emirates The government follows a policy of tolerance toward other religions and rarely interferes in the religious activities of non-Muslims [285]\n\n\nEducation\nThe education system through secondary level administered by the Ministry of Education in all emirates except Abu Dhabi, where it falls under the authority of the Department of Education and Knowledge Public schools are divided into primary schools, middle schools and high schools The public schools are government-funded and the curriculum is created to match the United Arab Emirates' development goals The medium of instruction in the public school is Arabic with emphasis on English as a second language There are also many private schools which are internationally accredited Public schools in the country are free for citizens of the UAE, while the fees for private schools vary.\n\n\nHealth\nThe life expectancy at birth in the UAE is at 76.96 years [307] Cardiovascular disease is the principal cause of death in the UAE, constituting 28% of total deaths; other major causes are accidents and injuries, malignancies, and congenital anomalies [308] According to World Health Organization data from 2016, 34.5% of adults in the UAE are clinically obese, with a body mass index (BMI) score of 30 or more [309]\n\n\nCulture\nEmirati culture is based on Arabian culture and has been influenced by the cultures of Persia, India, and East Africa [313] Arabian and Arabian inspired architecture is part of the expression of the local Emirati identity [314] Arabian influence on Emirati culture is noticeably visible in traditional Emirati architecture and folk arts [313] For example, the distinctive wind tower that tops traditional Emirati buildings, the barjeel, has become an identifying mark of Emirati architecture and is attributed to Arabian influence [313] This influence is derived both from traders who fled the tax regime in Persia in the early 19th century and from Emirati ownership of ports on the Arabian coast, for instance the Al Qassimi port of Lingeh [315]\n\n\nMedia\nThe UAE's media is annually classified as \"not free\" in the Freedom of the Press report by Freedom House [327] The UAE ranks poorly in the annual Press Freedom Index by Reporters without Borders Dubai Media City is the UAE's main media zone The UAE is home to some pan-Arab broadcasters, including the Middle East Broadcasting Centre and Orbit Showtime Network In 2007, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum decreed that journalists can no longer be prosecuted or imprisoned for reasons relating to their work [328] At the same time, the UAE has made it illegal to disseminate online material that can threaten \"public order\", [329] and hands down prison terms for those who \"deride or damage\" the reputation of the state and \"display contempt\" for religion Journalists who are arrested for violating this law are often brutally beaten by the police [330]\n\n\nCuisine\nThe traditional food of the Emirates has always been rice, fish, and meat The people of the United Arab Emirates have adopted most of their foods from other West and South Asian countries including Iran, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Pakistan and India Seafood has been the mainstay of the Emirati diet for centuries Meat and rice are other staple foods, with lamb and mutton preferred to goat and beef Popular beverages are coffee and tea, which can be complemented with cardamom or saffron to give them a distinctive flavour [335]\n\n\nSports\nFormula One is particularly popular in the United Arab Emirates, and a Grand Prix is annually held at the Yas Marina Circuit in Yas Island in Abu Dhabi The race takes place in the evening, and was the first ever Grand Prix to start in daylight and finish at night [339] Other popular sports include camel racing, falconry, endurance riding, and tennis [340] The emirate of Dubai is also home to two major golf courses: the Dubai Golf Club and Emirates Golf Club.\n\n\nFootball\nFootball is a popular sport in the UAE Al Nasr, Al Ain, Al Wasl, Sharjah, Al Wahda, and Shabab Al Ahli are the most popular teams and enjoy the reputation of long-time regional champions [343] The United Arab Emirates Football Association was established in 1971 and since then has dedicated its time and effort to promoting the game, organising youth programmes and improving the abilities of not only its players, but also the officials and coaches involved with its regional teams The UAE qualified for the FIFA World Cup in 1990, along with Egypt It was the third consecutive World Cup with two Arab nations qualifying, after Kuwait and Algeria in 1982, and Iraq and Algeria again in 1986 The UAE has won the Gulf Cup Championship twice: the first cup won in January 2007 held in Abu Dhabi and the second in January 2013, held in Bahrain [344] The country hosted the 2019 AFC Asian Cup The UAE team went all the way to the semi-finals, where they were defeated by the eventual champions, Qatar.\n\n\nCricket\nCricket is one of the most popular sports in the UAE, largely because of the expatriate population from the SAARC countries, the United Kingdom, and Australia The headquarters of the International Cricket Council (ICC) have been located in the Dubai Sports City complex since 2005, including the ICC Academy which was established in 2009 [345] There are a number of international cricket venues in the UAE, which are frequently used for international tournaments and \"neutral\" bilateral series due to the local climate and Dubai's status as a transport hub Notable international tournaments hosted by the UAE have included the 2014 Under-19 Cricket World Cup, the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup, and three editions of the Asia Cup (1984, 1995 and 2018) Notable grounds include the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium in Sharjah, [346] Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi, and Dubai International Cricket Stadium in Dubai [347]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nFurther

You would see defenders falling over and you were like: 'Wow' The goals that he scored, and at crucial times He scored goals where you were like: 'Oh man, this is not serious.'\" [208] Crediting the former Brazilian striker as his major influence as a kid, Lukaku added: \"He changed the dimension of a striker He was fast, he can dribble like a winger, run like a sprinter, he was as strong as an ox.\" [208] When mentioned that he shares certain characteristics with the Brazilian, Lukaku responded: \"Be like Ronaldo? There is only one Ronaldo.\" [208]\n\n\nPersonal life\nLukaku was born in Antwerp, Belgium [209] to Congolese parents [210] His father, Roger Lukaku, [211] played professional football and was capped at international level by Zaire [212] He has a younger brother named Jordan, who has progressed through the youth academy at Anderlecht [211] His cousin Boli Bolingoli-Mbombo plays as a left-sided winger or defender for Mechelen.\n\n\nMedia and endorsements\nLukaku was the first Premier League player to join Jay-Z's management agency Roc Nation Sports [219] In 2018, he signed a record sponsorship deal with German sportswear company Puma, the company's largest endorsement deal ever [220] Lukaku is also known by his nickname, \"Lakaka\", given to him by fans This nickname is often used sardonically to mock Lukaku's poor performances and gained popularity after his appearances in the 2022 World Cup and the 2023 Champions League Final [221]\n\n\nActivism\nLukaku has spoken out against racism he suffered while playing football, particularly the 2019–20 Serie A season, his first year playing in Italy [222]\n\n\nCareer statistics\nAnderlecht\n\n\nClub\nAnderlecht\n\n\nInternational\nAnderlecht\n\n\nHonours\nAnderlecht\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Romelu Lukaku\n\nRomelu Lukaku is a Belgian professional footballer who plays as a striker for Serie A club Napoli and the Belgium national team.

Premier League goals, scoring his 60th EPL goal for the Toffees in a 2–0 victory over Sunderland at Goodison Park [63] On 5 March, he surpassed Ferguson to become the outright record holder, scoring in a 3–2 loss against Tottenham Hotspur away at White Hart Lane [64] In the next match, a 3–0 home win against West Brom, Lukaku scored to become the first Everton player since Bob Latchford to score

Although the fee was officially undisclosed, it was reported to be worth an initial £75 million, plus £15 million in add-ons [74] Thus, he became a teammate with his French-speaking close friend Paul Pogba [75] Lukaku's signing came a day after former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney left the club to return to Everton, Rooney's boyhood club [76]\n\n\nTransfer\nLukaku joined Manchester United

goal for the club in a 2–1 defeat [77] His league debut came five days later at home to West Ham Lukaku scored twice in a 4–0 win, [78] becoming the fourth Manchester United player to score two goals on his Premier League debut for the club [79] On 12 September, he scored his first UEFA Champions League goal in a 3–0 win over Basel [80] On 17 September, Lukaku scored United's third goal in a 4–0 win over his former club Everton, with Lukaku running over towards Everton fans and cupping his ears during his goal celebration in response to being booed throughout the game [81]\n\n\n2018–19: Final season in Manchester\nLukaku started the 2018–19 season with four goals in his first five appearances, including a brace against Burnley, before a 12-game drought lasting from 19 September to 27 November 2018 Goals against Southampton and Fulham followed before the sacking of manager José Mourinho, only for Mourinho's replacement – former United striker Ole Gunnar Solskjær – to leave Lukaku out of the squad entirely for his first two games in charge against Cardiff City and Huddersfield Town Lukaku made substitute appearances in United's next two games against Bournemouth [86] and Newcastle United, [87] scoring in both matches within two minutes of coming on He then played the full 90 minutes of the FA Cup third round tie against Reading, scoring the second goal in a 2–0 win [88] However, Solskjær continued to prefer to start Marcus Rashford up front, and Lukaku started just five of the next nine games, playing the full 90 minutes in just two and failing to score in any of them His goalscoring form returned for the next three games, as he scored braces against each of Crystal Palace, [89] Southampton [90] and Paris Saint-Germain The goals against PSG were part of a 3–1 win that saw United through to the Champions League quarter-finals on the away goals rule, the first time any team had progressed after losing at home in the first leg by two goals or more [91] However, United were eliminated by Barcelona in the quarter-finals 4–0 on aggregate [92]\n\n\nInter Milan\nLukaku joined Italian club Inter Milan on 8 August 2019, signing a five-year contract for a fee reported to be a club record €80 million [93] [94] [95] He later mentioned the reasons for leaving Manchester United, by claiming that he was made a scapegoat alongside other players, such as Paul Pogba and Alexis Sánchez, in addition to club's failure to protect him against rumours about his future [96] Lukaku made his debut for Inter on 26 August in the opening Serie A matchday against Lecce, netting his side's third goal with his first shot in a 4–0 home win [97] The goal meant that Lukaku has found the net in his first league game for five of the six clubs he has represented: Anderlecht, West Brom, Everton, Manchester United and Inter; [98] he also become only the third Belgian to score for Inter in Serie A, after Enzo Scifo and Radja Nainggolan [99] In the club's second league game

were eliminated from all European competitions [123]\n\n\nReturn to Chelsea\nOn 12 August 2021, Lukaku returned to his former club Chelsea on a five-year deal, a decade after he had originally joined the club, for a reported club record fee of £97.5 million [129] In making the move, Lukaku became the most expensive player of all time, with cumulative transfer fees of almost £285 million, surpassing Neymar [130] Lukaku admitted in an interview that he did request Inter to reach to an agreement with Chelsea, stating: \"I didn't want to go behind Inter's back They got me out of the shit I was in a deep hole at Manchester United After training I went to  [head coach Simone] Inzaghi's office I didn't want to ruin the atmosphere because I was no longer with my head in Milan So I asked

Milan So I asked him: please find an agreement.\" [131]\n\n\n2022–23: Return to Inter Milan on loan and Champions League runner-up\nOn 29 June 2022, Chelsea announced that Lukaku would return to Inter for a season-long loan for the 2022–23 campaign [143] It was reported that they had agreed to pay a loan fee of approximately €8 million (£6.9 million), and that Lukaku took a pay cut [144] He would choose to wear the number 90 shirt, due to number 9 being already used by Edin Džeko [145] On 13 August, he scored his first goal since his return to the Nerazzurri in a 2–1 win over Lecce [146]\n\n\n2023–24: Loan to Roma\nDuring the summer of 2023, Lukaku was reportedly negotiating with Inter Milan rivals Juventus for a possible move, enraging many Inter and Juventus fans [157] [158] However, on 31 August 2023, Lukaku was sent to another Serie A club, Roma, [159] on a season-long loan deal for a reported fee in the region of £8 million (€9.3 million), with the club covering the whole of the player's salary [160] Lukaku also reportedly agreed to a new contract at Chelsea, which included a wage cut to the remainder of his contract and a release clause of £37 million [161] On 1 September, he made his debut for Roma at Stadio Olimpico, coming off the bench in a 2–1 defeat against Milan [162] On 17 September, he scored his first goal in a 7–0 win over Empoli

against Russia [168] Lukaku scored his first goal in almost two years for the national team, netting the winner in a 4–2 friendly victory over rivals the Netherlands on 15 August 2012 [169]\n\n\n2008–2017: Youth level and early international career\nLukaku was a member of the Belgium under-21 team and scored a goal on his debut against Slovenia On 24 February 2010, Lukaku was named for the first time in the Belgium senior squad for a friendly against Croatia [167] On 17 November 2010, he scored his first two international goals in a friendly against Russia [168] Lukaku scored his first goal in almost two years for the national team, netting the winner in a 4–2 friendly victory over rivals the Netherlands on 15 August 2012 [169]\n\n\n2017–2018: All-time Belgium top scorer\nOn 10 November 2017, Lukaku equalled the all-time Belgium goalscoring record set by Bernard Voorhoof and Paul Van Himst, after scoring twice against Mexico in a 3–3 draw [178] Four days after he equalled the record, Lukaku became Belgium's all-time record goalscorer with 31 international goals at the age of 24, after he scored the only goal in a 1–0 win over Japan [179] Although this record was counted by the Royal Belgian Football Association, [180] FIFA initially only officially recognised 28 goals, after a nullified international friendly against Luxembourg on 26 May 2014, where he netted a hat trick in a 5–1 win, because the former Belgium coach, Marc Wilmots made seven substitutions during the match instead of the permitted six, which are not in accordance to the laws of the game [181] [182] In 2023, FIFA recognizes the three matches from 2012, 2014 and 2017 in their FIFA Century Club [183]\n\n\n2018–2022: Belgium's Golden Generation\nOn 18 June, Lukaku scored twice in a 3–0 win over Panama in their opening group game at the 2018 FIFA World Cup [185] In the next group game on 23 June 2018, he scored twice again in a 5–2 win over Tunisia [186] In doing so, Lukaku became the first player since Diego Maradona in 1986 to score two goals or more in consecutive World Cup matches [187] He eventually ended the tournament with four goals and one assist, which earned him the Bronze Boot award, as Belgium finished the tournament in third place [188]\n\n\n2023–present\nDuring qualifying for UEFA Euro 2024, Lukaku scored 14 goals in eight appearances, breaking the record for goals scored by a player in a European Championship qualifying campaign [197] On 28 May 2024, he was selected in the 25-man squad for the Euro 2024 [198] On 17 June, he was denied two goals by VAR in the opening match against Slovakia, which ended in a 1–0 defeat [199]\n\n\nStyle of play\nLukaku is a left-footed player, [200] who in 2014 was named by The Guardian as one of the ten most promising young players in Europe A large and physically powerful striker from an early age, with an eye for goal, Lukaku has been known to use his physicality to get around defenders [9] [36] However, despite his size, strength, physical build and ability to hold-up play with his back to goal, his favoured role is not as a target-man in the centre, but as an out-and-out striker or poacher; due to his tactical versatility, he is also capable of playing as a winger [201] A well-rounded forward, who is also strong in the air, beyond his physical qualities and goalscoring ability, he possesses pace, athleticism, awareness, good link-up play, technical attributes and vision, as well as an ability to get into good attacking positions or create space for teammates with his intelligent runs off the ball [202] Although he was once criticised by pundits for his limited defensive contribution, he has since been praised by his managers for his work-rate off the ball [203] However, despite his ability, he has also come into criticism in the media at times over his movement and first touch [204] [205] [206] [207]\n\n\nInfluences\nIn a 2016 interview with ESPN, Lukaku named Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka as the two strikers who made him want to play for Chelsea, but said that Ronaldo was his idol: \"Ronaldo changed football He was the one you would look at You would see him doing step-overs and you were thinking: 'Who does this?' You would see defenders falling over and you were like: 'Wow' The goals that he scored, and at crucial times He scored goals where you were like: 'Oh man, this is not serious.'\" [208] Crediting the former Brazilian striker as his major influence as a kid, Lukaku added: \"He changed the dimension of a striker He was fast, he can dribble like a winger, run like a sprinter, he was as strong as an ox.\" [208] When mentioned that he shares certain characteristics with the Brazilian, Lukaku responded: \"Be like Ronaldo? There is only one Ronaldo.\" [208]\n\n\nPersonal life\nLukaku was born in Antwerp, Belgium [209] to Congolese parents [210] His father, Roger Lukaku, [211] played professional football and was capped at international level by Zaire [212] He has a younger brother named Jordan, who has progressed through the youth academy at Anderlecht [211] His cousin Boli Bolingoli-Mbombo plays as a left-sided winger or defender for Mechelen.\n\n\nMedia and endorsements\nLukaku was the first Premier League player to join Jay-Z's management agency Roc Nation Sports [219] In 2018, he signed a record sponsorship deal with German sportswear company Puma, the company's largest endorsement deal ever [220] Lukaku is also known by his nickname, \"Lakaka\", given to him by fans This nickname is often used sardonically to mock Lukaku's poor performances and gained popularity after his appearances in the 2022 World Cup and the 2023 Champions League Final [221]\n\n\nActivism\nLukaku has spoken out against racism he suffered while playing football, particularly the 2019–20 Serie A season, his first year playing in Italy [222]\n\n\nCareer statistics\nAnderlecht\n\n\nClub\nAnderlecht\n\n\nInternational\nAnderlecht\n\n\nHonours\nAnderlecht\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Gilded_Age", "content": "\nThe name and the era\nThe term Gilded Age was applied to the era by 1920s historians who took the term from one of Mark Twain's lesser-known novels, The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today (1873) The book (co-written with Charles Dudley Warner) satirized the promised \"golden age\" after the Civil War, portrayed as an era of serious social problems masked by a thin gold gilding of economic expansion [7] In the 1920s, and 1930s, the metaphor \"Gilded Age\" began to be applied to a designated period in American history The term was adopted by literary and cultural critics as well as historians, including Van Wyck Brooks, Lewis Mumford, Charles Austin Beard, Mary Ritter Beard, Vernon Louis Parrington, and Matthew Josephson For them, Gilded Age was a pejorative term for a time of materialistic excesses and widespread political corruption [8]\n\n\nIndustrial and technological advances\nThe Gilded Age was a period of economic growth as the United States jumped to the lead in industrialization ahead of Britain The nation was rapidly expanding its economy into new areas, especially heavy industry like factories, railroads, and coal mining In 1869, the first transcontinental railroad opened up the far-west mining and ranching regions Travel from New York to San Francisco then took six days instead of six months [14] Railroad track mileage tripled from 1860 to 1880, and then doubled again by 1920 The new track linked formerly isolated areas with larger markets and allowed for the rise of commercial farming, ranching, and mining, creating a truly national marketplace American steel production rose to surpass the combined totals of Britain, Germany, and France [15]\n\n\nTechnical advances\nThe Gilded Age was a period of economic growth as the

creating a truly national marketplace American steel production rose to surpass the combined totals of Britain, Germany, and France [15]\n\n\nRailroads\nAccording to historian Henry Adams the system of railroads needed:\n\n\nShipping freight and passengers\nRailroads provided a highly efficient network for shipping freight and passengers throughout the U.S., spurring the evolution of a large national market This had a transformative impact on most sectors of the economy including manufacturing, retail and wholesale, agriculture, and finance The result was an integrated market practically the size of Europe's, with no internal barriers, tariffs, or language barriers to hamper it, and  a common financial and legal system to support it [25]\n\n\nBasis of the private financial system\nRailroad financing provided the basis for a dramatic expansion of the private financial system Construction of railroads was far more expensive than factories In 1860, the combined total of railroad stocks and bonds was $1.8 billion; 1897, it reached $10.6 billion (compared to a total national debt of $1.2 billion) [26] [clarification needed]  Funding came primarily from private finance throughout the Northeast, and from Europe, especially Britain, [27] with about 10 percent coming from the Federal government, especially in the form of land grants that could be realized when a certain amount of trackage was opened [28] The emerging American financial system was based on railroad bonds By 1860, New York was the dominant financial market The British invested heavily in railroads around the world, but nowhere more so than the United States; The total came to about $3 billion by 1914 In 1914–1917, they liquidated their American assets to pay for war supplies [29] [30]\n\n\nInventing modern management\nRailroad management designed complex systems that could handle far more complicated simultaneous relationships than could be dreamed of by the local factory owner who could patrol every part of his own factory in a matter of hours Civil engineers became the senior management of railroads The leading innovators were the Western Railroad of Massachusetts and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in the 1840s, the Erie in the 1850s, and the Pennsylvania in the 1860s [31]\n\n\nCareer paths\nThe railroads invented the career path in the private sector for both blue- and white-collar workers Railroading became a lifetime career for young men; women were rarely hired A typical career path would see a young man hired at age 18 as a shop laborer and promoted to skilled mechanic at age 24, brakeman at 25, freight conductor at 27, and passenger conductor at age 57 White-collar career paths likewise were delineated Educated young men started in clerical or statistical work and moved up to station agents or bureaucrats at the divisional or central headquarters.\n\n\nRailroad controversy\nAmerica developed a love-hate relationship with railroads Boosters in every city worked feverishly to make sure the railroad came through, knowing their urban dreams depended upon it The mechanical size, scope, and efficiency of the railroads made a profound impression; people dressed in their Sunday best to go down to the terminal to watch the train come in Travel became much easier, cheaper, and more common Shoppers from small towns could make day trips to big city stores Hotels, resorts, and tourist attractions were built to accommodate the demand The realization that anyone could buy a ticket for a thousand-mile trip was empowering Historians Gary Cross and Rick Szostak argue:\n\n\nImpact on farming\nThe growth of railroads from 1850s to 1880s made commercial farming much more feasible and profitable Millions of acres were opened to settlement once the railroad was nearby, and provided a long-distance outlet for wheat, cattle and hogs that reached all the way to Europe [41] Rural America became one giant market, as wholesalers bought the consumer products produced by the factories in the East and shipped them to local merchants in small stores nationwide Shipping live animals was slow and expensive It was more efficient to slaughter them in major packing centers such as Chicago, Kansas City, St Louis, Milwaukee, and Cincinnati, and then ship dressed meat out in refrigerated freight cars The cars were cooled by slabs of ice that had been harvested from the northern lakes in wintertime and stored for summer and fall usage Chicago, the main railroad center, benefited enormously, with Kansas City a distant second Historian William Cronon concludes:\n\n\nEconomic growth\nDuring the 1870s and 1880s, the U.S economy rose at the fastest rate in its history, with real wages, wealth, GDP, and capital formation all increasing rapidly [43] For example, from 1865 to 1898, the output of wheat increased by 256%, corn by 222%, coal by 800%, and miles of railway track by 567% [44] Thick national networks for transportation and communication were created The corporation became the dominant form of business organization, and a scientific management revolution transformed business operations [45] [46]\n\n\nWages\nThe rapid expansion of industrialization led to real wage growth of 60% from 1860 to 1890, spread across the increasing labor force [56] Real wages (adjusting for inflation) rose steadily, with the exact percentage increase depending on the dates and the specific work force The Census Bureau reported in 1892, that the average annual wage per industrial worker (including men, women, and children) rose from $380 in 1880 to $564 in 1890, a gain of 48% [2] Economic historian Clarence D Long estimates that (in terms of constant 1914 dollars), the average annual incomes of all American non-farm employees rose from $375 in 1870 to $395 in 1880, $519 in 1890 and $573 in 1900, a gain of 53% in 30 years [57]\n\n\nWealth disparity\nThe unequal distribution of wealth remained high during this period From 1860 to 1900, the wealthiest 2% of American households owned more than a third of the nation's wealth, while the top 10% owned roughly three-quarters of it [60] The bottom 40% had no wealth at all [4] In terms of property, the wealthiest 1% owned 51%, while the bottom 44% claimed 1.1% [4]\n\n\nRise of labor unions\nCraft-oriented labor unions, such as carpenters, printers, shoemakers and cigar makers, grew steadily in the industrial cities after 1870 These unions used frequent short strikes as a method to attain control over the labor market and fight off competing unions [68] They generally blocked women, blacks, and Chinese from union membership, but welcomed most European immigrants [69]\n\n\nPolitics\nGilded Age politics, called the Third Party System, featured intense competition between two major parties, with minor parties coming and going, especially on issues of concern to prohibitionists, to labor unions and to farmers The Democrats and Republicans (the latter nicknamed the \"Grand Old Party\", GOP) fought over control of offices, which were the rewards for party activists, as well as over major economic issues Very high voter turnout typically exceeded 80% or even 90% in some Northern states as the parties ran strong campaigns Turnout in the South was lower Average presidential turnout 1872 to 1900 was 83% in the North and 62% in the South [82]\n\n\nMetropolitan area politics\nThe major metropolitan centers underwent rapid population growth and as a result had many lucrative contracts and jobs to award To take advantage of the new economic opportunity, both parties built so-called \"political machines\" to manage elections, to reward supporters and to pay off potential opponents Financed by the \"spoils system\", the winning party distributed most local, state and national government jobs, and many government contracts, to its loyal supporters [86]\n\n\nScandals and corruption\nPolitical corruption was rampant, as business leaders spent significant amounts of money ensuring that government did not regulate the activities of big business—and they more often than not got what they wanted Such corruption was so commonplace that in 1868 the New York state legislature legalized such bribery [87] Historian Howard Zinn argues that the U.S government was acting exactly as Karl Marx described capitalist states: \"pretending neutrality to maintain order, but serving the interests of the rich\" [88] Historian Mark Wahlgren Summers calls it, \"The Era of Good Stealings\" (a play on the Era of Good Feelings), noting how machine politicians used \"padded expenses, lucrative contracts, outright embezzlements, and illegal bond issues.\" He concludes:\n\n\nNational politics\nMajor scandals reached into Congress with the Crédit Mobilier scandal of 1872, and disgraced the White House during the Grant Administration (1869–1877) This corruption divided the Republican party into two different factions: the Stalwarts led by Roscoe Conkling and the Half-Breeds led by James G Blaine There was a sense that government-enabled political machines intervened in the economy and that the resulting favoritism, bribery, inefficiency, waste, and corruption were having negative consequences Accordingly, there were widespread calls for reform, such as Civil Service Reform led by the Bourbon Democrats and Republican Mugwumps [93] In 1884, their support elected Democrat Grover Cleveland to the White House, and in doing so gave the Democrats their first national victory since 1856 [94]\n\n\nEthnocultural politics: pietistic Republicans versus liturgical Democrats\nFrom 1860 to the early 20th century, the Republicans took advantage of the association of the Democrats with \"Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion\" \"Rum\" stood for the liquor interests and the tavern keepers, in contrast to the GOP, which had a strong dry element \"Romanism\" meant Roman Catholics, especially Irish Americans, who ran the Democratic Party in most cities, and whom the reformers denounced for political corruption and their separate parochial school system \"Rebellion\" harked back to the Democrats of the Confederacy, who had tried to break the Union in 1861, as well as to their northern allies, called \"Copperheads\" [103]\n\n\nImmigration\nPrior to the Gilded Age, the time commonly referred to as the old immigration saw the first real boom of new arrivals to the United States During the Gilded Age, approximately 20 million immigrants came to the United States in what is known as the new immigration Some of them were prosperous farmers who had the cash to buy land and tools in the Plains states especially Many were poor peasants looking for the American Dream in unskilled manual labor in mills, mines, and factories Few immigrants went to the poverty-stricken South, though To accommodate the heavy influx, the federal government in 1892 opened a reception center at Ellis Island near the Statue of Liberty; new arrivals needed to pass a medical inspection [107]\n\n\nWaves of old and new immigrants\nThese European immigrants consisted of two groups: The last big waves of the \"Old Immigration\" from Germany, Britain, Ireland, and Scandinavia, and the rising waves of the \"New Immigration\", which peaked about 1910 Some men moved back and forth across the Atlantic Ocean, but most were permanent settlers They moved into well-established communities, both urban and rural The German American communities spoke German, but their younger generation was bilingual [108] The Scandinavian groups generally assimilated quickly; they were noted for their support of reform programs, such as prohibition [109]\n\n\nNew immigrants\nThe \"New Immigration\" were much poorer peasants and rural folk from southern and eastern Europe, including mostly Italians, Poles, and Jews Some men, especially the Italians and Greeks, saw themselves as temporary migrants who planned to return to their home villages with a nest egg of cash earned in long hours of unskilled labor Others, especially the Jews, had been driven out of Eastern Europe and had no intention of returning [116]\n\n\nChinese immigrants\nChinese immigrants were hired by California construction companies for temporary railroad work European Americans strongly disliked the Chinese for their alien lifestyles and the threat of low wages The construction of the Central Pacific Railroad from California to Utah was handled largely by Chinese laborers In the 1870 census, there were 63,000 Chinese men, with a few women in the entire U.S.; this number grew to 106,000 in 1880 [119] Labor unions, led by Samuel Gompers strongly opposed the presence of Chinese labor Immigrants from China were not allowed to become citizens until 1950; however, as a result of the Supreme Court decision in United States v Wong Kim Ark, their children born in the U.S were full citizens [120]\n\n\nRural life\nA dramatic expansion in farming took place during the Gilded Age, [122] [123] with the number of farms tripling from 2.0 million in 1860 to 6.0 million in 1905 The number of people living on farms grew from about 10 million in 1860 to 22 million in 1880 to 31 million in 1905 The value of farms soared from $8.0 billion in 1860 to $30 billion in 1906 [124]\n\n\nUrban life\nAmerican society experienced significant changes in the period following the Civil War, most notably the rapid urbanization of the North [134] Due to the increasing demand for unskilled workers, most European immigrants went to mill towns, mining camps, and industrial cities New York, Philadelphia, and especially Chicago saw rapid growth Louis Sullivan became a noted architect using steel frames to construct skyscrapers for the first time while pioneering the idea of \"form follows function\" Chicago became the center of the skyscraper craze, starting with the ten-story Home Insurance Building in 1884–1885 by William Le Baron Jenney [135]\n\n\nThe South and the West\nThe South remained heavily rural and was much poorer than the North or West [142] In the South, Reconstruction brought major changes in agricultural practices The most significant of these was sharecropping, where tenant farmers \"shared\" up to half of their crop with the landowners, in exchange for seed and essential supplies About 80% of the Black farmers and 40% of White ones lived under this system after the Civil War Most sharecroppers were locked in a cycle of debt, from which the only hope of escape was increased planting This led to the over-production of cotton and tobacco (and thus to declining prices and income), soil exhaustion, and poverty among both landowners and tenants [143]\n\n\nThe South\nThe South remained heavily

prices and income), soil exhaustion, and poverty among both landowners and tenants [143]\n\n\nThe West\nIn 1869, the first transcontinental railroad—a combination of the Union Pacific from Omaha to Utah and the Central Pacific from Utah to California—opened up the far west mining and ranching regions Travel from New York to San Francisco now took six days instead of six months [150]\n\n\nFamily life\nIn the Gilded Age West, few single men attempted to operate a farm Farmers clearly understood the need for a hard-working wife, and numerous children, to handle the many chores, including child-rearing, feeding and clothing the family, managing the housework, and feeding the hired hands [152] During the early years of settlement, farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors After a generation or so, women increasingly left the fields, thus redefining their roles within the family New conveniences such as sewing and washing machines encouraged women to turn to domestic roles The scientific housekeeping movement was promoted across the land by the media and government extension agents, as well as county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning, advice columns for women in the farm papers, and home economics courses in schools [153]\n\n\nNative assimilation\nNative American policy was set by the national government (the states had very little role), and after 1865 the national policy was that Native Americans either had to assimilate into the larger community or remain on reservations, where the government provided subsidies Reservation natives were no longer allowed to roam or fight their traditional enemies The U.S Army was to enforce the laws Natives of the West came in conflict with expansion by miners, ranchers and settlers By 1880, the buffalo herds, a foundation for the hunting economy had disappeared Violence petered out in the 1880s and practically ceased after 1890 [161]\n\n\nArt\nSome well-known painters of the Gilded Age include: Jules Breton, Winslow Homer, Thomas Eakins, William Merritt Chase, John Singer Sargent, Mary Cassatt, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Childe Hassam, John Henry Twachtman, and Maurice Prendergast [163] [164]\n\n\nWomen's roles\nDuring the Gilded Age, many new social movements took hold in the United States Many women abolitionists who were disappointed that the Fifteenth Amendment did not extend voting rights to them, remained active in politics, this time focusing on issues important to them Reviving the temperance movement from the Second Great Awakening, many women joined the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in an attempt to bring morality back to America Its chief leader was Frances Willard (1839–1898), who had a national and international outreach from her base in Evanston, Illinois Often the WCTU women took up the issue of women's suffrage which had lain dormant since the Seneca Falls Convention With leaders like Susan B Anthony, the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) was formed to secure the right of women to vote [178]\n\n\nSocial activism\nDuring the Gilded Age, many new social movements took hold

[178]\n\n\nEmployment\nMany young women worked as servants or in shops and factories until marriage, then typically became full-time housewives However, black, Irish and Swedish adult women often worked as servants In most large Northern cities, the Irish Catholic women dominated the market for servants [179] Heavy industry was a male domain, but in light industries such as textiles and food processing, large numbers of young women were hired Thousands of young unmarried Irish and French Canadian women worked in Northeastern textile mills Coming from poor families these jobs meant upward social mobility, more money, and more social prestige in their community that made them more attractive marriage partners In Cohoes, New York, mill women went on strike in 1882 to gain union recognition They fought off Swedish strike breakers to protect the status they had achieved [180]\n\n\nSocial thought\nA leading magazine, The Nation, espoused classical liberalism in every week's issue starting in 1865, under the influential editor E L Godkin (1831–1902) [188]\n\n\nReligion\nThe Third Great Awakening which began before the Civil War returned and made a significant change in religious attitudes toward social progress Followers of the new Awakening promoted the idea of the Social Gospel which gave rise to organizations such as the YMCA, the American branch of the Salvation Army, and settlement houses such as Hull House, founded by Jane Addams in Chicago in 1889 [190]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nHistoriography\n\n\nPrimary

in the United States, spanning from the late 1860s to the late 1890s. This era was marked by rapid industrialization, technological advancements, and unprecedented economic growth, accompanied by widespread poverty, inequality, and social unrest.\n\n### The Name and the Era\n\nThe term Gilded Age was applied to the era by 1920s historians who took the term from one of Mark Twain's lesser-known novels, The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today (1873). The book satirized the promised \"golden age\" after the Civil War, portrayed as an era of serious social problems masked by a thin gold gilding of economic expansion. In the 1920s, and 1930s, the metaphor \"Gilded Age\" began to be applied to a designated period in American history.\n\n### Industrial and Technological Advances\n\nThe Gilded Age was a period of economic growth as the United States jumped to the lead in industrialization ahead of Britain. The nation was rapidly expanding its economy into new areas, especially heavy industry like factories, railroads, and coal mining. In 1869, the first transcontinental railroad opened up the far-west mining and ranching regions, reducing travel time from New York to San Francisco from six months to six days. Railroad track mileage tripled from 1860 to 1880, and then doubled again by 1920, linking formerly isolated areas with larger markets and allowing for the rise of commercial farming, ranching, and mining.\n\n### Railroads\n\nRailroads provided a highly efficient network for shipping freight and passengers throughout the U.S., spurring the evolution of a large national market. This had a transformative impact on most sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, retail and wholesale, agriculture, and finance. The result was an integrated market practically the size of Europe's, with no internal barriers, tariffs, or language barriers to hamper it, and a common financial and legal system to support it.\n\n### Technical Advances\n\nThe Gilded Age was a period of significant technological advancements, including the development of the telegraph, the telephone, and the light bulb. These innovations facilitated communication, transportation, and industry, further fueling economic growth and transformation.\n\n### Railroads Financing\n\nRailroad financing provided the basis for a dramatic expansion of the private financial system. Construction of railroads was far more expensive than factories, requiring massive investments of capital. In 1860, the combined total of railroad stocks and bonds was $1.8 billion, reaching $10.6 billion by 1897. Funding came primarily from private finance, with about 10 percent coming from the Federal government, especially in the form of land grants that could be realized when a certain amount of trackage was opened.\n\n### Inventing Modern Management\n\nRailroad management designed complex systems that could handle far more complicated simultaneous relationships than could be dreamed of by the local factory owner. Civil engineers became the senior management of railroads, with innovators such as the Western Railroad of Massachusetts and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad leading the way.\n\n### Career Paths\n\nThe railroads invented the career path in the private sector for both blue- and white-collar workers. Railroading became a lifetime career for young men, with women rarely hired. A typical career path would see a young man hired at age 18 as a shop laborer and promoted to skilled mechanic at age 24, brakeman at 25, freight conductor at 27, and passenger conductor at age 57.\n\n### Railroad Controversy\n\nAmerica developed a love-hate relationship with railroads, with boosters in every city working feverishly to make sure the railroad came through, knowing their urban dreams depended upon it. The mechanical size, scope, and efficiency of the railroads made a profound impression, with people dressing in their Sunday best to go down to the terminal to watch the train come in.\n\n### Impact on Farming\n\nThe growth of railroads from 1850s to 1880s made commercial farming much more feasible and profitable. Millions of acres were opened to settlement once the railroad was nearby, providing a long-distance outlet for wheat, cattle, and hogs that reached all the way to Europe. Rural America became one giant market, with wholesalers buying consumer products produced by factories in the East and shipping them to local merchants in small stores nationwide.\n\n### Economic Growth\n\nDuring the 1870s and 1880s, the U.S economy rose at the fastest rate in its history, with real wages, wealth, GDP, and capital formation all increasing rapidly. For example, from 1865 to 1898, the output of wheat increased by 256%, corn by 222%, coal by 800%, and miles of railway track by 567%.\n\n### Wages\n\nThe rapid expansion of industrialization led to real wage growth of 60% from 1860 to 1890, spread across the increasing labor force. Real wages (adjusting for inflation) rose steadily, with the exact percentage increase depending on the dates and the specific workforce.\n\n### Wealth Disparity\n\nThe unequal distribution of wealth remained high during this period. From 1860 to 1900, the wealthiest 2% of American households owned more than a third of the nation's wealth, while the top 10% owned roughly three-quarters of it. The bottom 40% had no wealth at all.\n\n### Rise of Labor Unions\n\nCraft-oriented labor unions, such as carpenters, printers, shoemakers, and cigar makers, grew steadily in the industrial cities after 1870. These unions used frequent short strikes as a method to attain control over the labor market and fight off competing unions. They generally blocked women, blacks, and Chinese from union membership, but welcomed most European immigrants.\n\n### Politics\n\nGilded Age politics, called the Third Party System, featured intense competition between two major parties, with minor parties coming and going, especially on issues of concern to prohibitionists, to labor unions, and to farmers. The Democrats and Republicans fought over control of offices, which were the rewards for party activists, as well as over major economic issues.\n\n### Metropolitan Area Politics\n\nThe major metropolitan centers underwent rapid population growth and as a result had many lucrative contracts and jobs to award. To take advantage of the new economic opportunity, both parties built so-called \"political machines\" to manage elections, to reward supporters, and to pay off potential opponents.\n\n### Scandals and Corruption\n\nPolitical corruption was rampant, with business leaders spending significant amounts of money ensuring that government did not regulate the activities of big business—and they more often than not got what they wanted. Such corruption was so commonplace that in 1868 the New York state legislature legalized bribery.\n\n### National Politics\n\nMajor scandals reached into Congress with the Crédit Mobilier scandal of 1872, and disgraced the White House during the Grant Administration (1869-1877). This corruption divided the Republican party into two different factions: the Stalwarts led by Roscoe Conkling and the Half-Breeds led by James G Blaine.\n\n### Ethnocultural Politics: Pietistic Republicans versus Liturgical Democrats\n\nFrom 1860 to the early 20th century, the Republicans took advantage of the association of the Democrats with \"Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion\". \"Rum\" stood for the liquor interests and the tavern keepers, in contrast to the GOP, which had a strong dry element. \"Romanism\" meant Roman Catholics, especially Irish Americans, who ran the Democratic Party in most cities, and whom the reformers denounced for political corruption and their separate parochial school system.\n\n### Immigration\n\nPrior to the Gilded Age, the time commonly referred to as the old immigration saw the first real boom of new arrivals to the United States.

and 1930s, the metaphor \"Gilded Age\" began to be applied to a designated period in American history The term was adopted by literary and cultural critics as well as historians, including Van Wyck Brooks, Lewis Mumford, Charles Austin Beard, Mary Ritter Beard, Vernon Louis Parrington, and Matthew Josephson For them, Gilded Age was a pejorative term for a time of materialistic excesses and

the basis for a dramatic expansion of the private financial system Construction of railroads was far more expensive than factories In 1860, the combined total of railroad stocks and bonds was $1.8 billion; 1897, it reached $10.6 billion (compared to a total national debt of $1.2 billion) [26] [clarification needed]  Funding came primarily from private finance throughout the Northeast, and from Europe, especially Britain, [27] with about 10 percent coming from the Federal government, especially in the form of land grants that could be realized when a certain amount of trackage was opened [28] The emerging American financial system was based on railroad bonds By 1860, New York was the dominant financial market The British invested heavily in railroads around the world, but nowhere more so than the United States; The total came to about $3 billion by 1914 In 1914–1917, they liquidated their American assets to pay for war supplies [29] [30]\n\n\nInventing modern management\nRailroad management designed complex systems that could handle far more complicated simultaneous relationships than could be dreamed of by the local factory owner who could patrol every part of his own factory in a matter of hours Civil engineers became the senior management of railroads The leading innovators were the Western Railroad of Massachusetts and the Baltimore and Ohio

moved up to station agents or bureaucrats at the divisional or central headquarters.\n\n\nRailroad controversy\nAmerica developed a love-hate relationship with railroads Boosters in every city worked feverishly to make sure the railroad came through, knowing their urban dreams depended upon it The mechanical size, scope, and efficiency of the railroads made a profound impression; people dressed in their Sunday best to go down to the terminal to watch the train come in Travel became much easier, cheaper, and more common Shoppers from small towns could make day trips to big city stores Hotels, resorts, and tourist attractions were built to accommodate the demand The realization that anyone could buy a ticket for a thousand-mile trip was empowering Historians Gary Cross and Rick Szostak argue:\n\n\nImpact on farming\nThe growth of railroads from 1850s to 1880s made commercial farming much more feasible and profitable Millions of acres were opened to settlement once the railroad was nearby, and provided a long-distance outlet for wheat, cattle and hogs that reached all the way to Europe [41] Rural America became one giant market, as wholesalers bought the consumer products produced by the factories in the East and shipped them to local merchants in small stores nationwide Shipping live animals was slow and expensive It was more efficient to slaughter them in major packing centers such as Chicago, Kansas City, St Louis, Milwaukee, and Cincinnati, and then ship dressed meat out in refrigerated freight cars The cars were cooled by slabs of ice that had been harvested from the northern lakes in wintertime and stored for summer and fall usage Chicago, the main railroad center, benefited enormously, with Kansas City a distant second Historian William Cronon concludes:\n\n\nEconomic growth\nDuring the 1870s and 1880s, the U.S economy rose at the fastest rate in its history, with real wages, wealth, GDP, and capital formation all increasing rapidly [43] For example, from 1865 to 1898, the output of wheat increased by 256%, corn by 222%, coal by 800%, and miles of railway track by 567% [44] Thick national networks for transportation and communication were created The corporation became the dominant form of business organization, and a scientific management revolution transformed business operations [45] [46]\n\n\nWages\nThe rapid expansion of industrialization led to real wage growth of 60% from 1860 to 1890, spread across the increasing labor force [56] Real wages (adjusting for inflation) rose steadily, with the exact percentage increase depending on the dates and the specific work force The Census Bureau reported in 1892, that the average annual wage per industrial worker (including men, women, and children) rose from $380 in 1880 to $564 in 1890, a gain of 48% [2] Economic historian Clarence D Long estimates that (in terms of constant 1914 dollars), the average annual incomes of all American non-farm employees rose from $375 in 1870 to $395 in 1880, $519 in 1890 and $573 in 1900, a gain of 53% in 30 years [57]\n\n\nWealth disparity\nThe unequal distribution of wealth remained high during this period From 1860 to 1900, the wealthiest 2% of American households owned more than a third of the nation's wealth, while the top 10% owned roughly three-quarters of it [60] The bottom 40% had no wealth at all [4] In terms of property, the wealthiest 1% owned 51%, while the bottom 44% claimed 1.1% [4]\n\n\nRise of labor unions\nCraft-oriented labor unions, such as carpenters, printers, shoemakers and cigar makers, grew steadily in the industrial cities after 1870 These unions used frequent short strikes as a method to attain control over the labor market and fight off competing unions [68] They generally blocked women, blacks, and Chinese from union membership, but welcomed most European immigrants [69]\n\n\nPolitics\nGilded Age politics, called the Third Party System, featured intense competition between two major parties, with minor parties coming and going, especially on issues of concern to prohibitionists, to labor unions and to farmers The Democrats and Republicans (the latter nicknamed the \"Grand Old Party\", GOP) fought over control of offices, which were the rewards for party activists, as well as over major economic issues Very high voter turnout typically exceeded 80% or even 90% in some Northern states as the parties ran strong campaigns Turnout in the South was lower Average presidential turnout 1872 to 1900 was 83% in the North and 62% in the South [82]\n\n\nMetropolitan area politics\nThe major metropolitan centers underwent rapid population growth and as a result had many lucrative contracts and jobs to award To take advantage of the new economic opportunity, both parties built so-called \"political machines\" to manage elections, to reward supporters and to pay off potential opponents Financed by the \"spoils system\", the winning party distributed most local, state and national government jobs, and many government contracts, to its loyal supporters [86]\n\n\nScandals and corruption\nPolitical corruption was rampant, as business leaders spent significant amounts of money ensuring that government did not regulate the activities of big business—and they more often than not got what they wanted Such corruption was so commonplace that in 1868 the New York state legislature legalized such bribery [87] Historian Howard Zinn argues that the U.S government was acting exactly as Karl Marx described capitalist states: \"pretending neutrality to maintain order, but serving the interests of the rich\" [88] Historian Mark Wahlgren Summers calls it, \"The Era of Good Stealings\" (a play on the Era of Good Feelings), noting how machine politicians used \"padded expenses, lucrative contracts, outright embezzlements, and illegal bond issues.\" He concludes:\n\n\nNational politics\nMajor scandals reached into Congress with the Crédit Mobilier scandal of 1872, and disgraced the White House during the Grant Administration (1869–1877) This corruption divided the Republican party into two different factions: the Stalwarts led by Roscoe Conkling and the Half-Breeds led by James G Blaine There was a sense that government-enabled political machines intervened in the economy and that the resulting favoritism, bribery, inefficiency, waste, and corruption were having negative consequences Accordingly, there were widespread calls for reform, such as Civil Service Reform led by the Bourbon Democrats and Republican Mugwumps [93] In 1884, their support elected Democrat Grover Cleveland to the White House, and in doing so gave the Democrats their first national victory since 1856 [94]\n\n\nEthnocultural politics: pietistic Republicans versus liturgical Democrats\nFrom 1860 to the early 20th century, the Republicans took advantage of the association of the Democrats with \"Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion\" \"Rum\" stood for the liquor interests and the tavern keepers, in contrast to the GOP, which had a strong dry element \"Romanism\" meant Roman Catholics, especially Irish Americans, who ran the Democratic Party in most cities, and whom the reformers denounced for political corruption and their separate parochial school system \"Rebellion\" harked back to the Democrats of the Confederacy, who had tried to break the Union in 1861, as well as to their northern allies, called \"Copperheads\" [103]\n\n\nImmigration\nPrior to the Gilded Age, the time commonly referred to as the old immigration saw the first real boom of new arrivals to the United States During the Gilded Age, approximately 20 million immigrants came to the United States in what is known as the new immigration Some of them were prosperous farmers who had the cash to buy land and tools in the Plains states especially Many were poor peasants looking for the American Dream in unskilled manual labor in mills, mines, and factories Few immigrants went to the poverty-stricken South, though To accommodate the heavy influx, the federal government in 1892 opened a reception center at Ellis Island near the Statue of Liberty; new arrivals needed to pass a medical inspection [107]\n\n\nWaves of old and new immigrants\nThese European immigrants consisted of two groups: The last big waves of the \"Old Immigration\" from Germany, Britain, Ireland, and Scandinavia, and the rising waves of the \"New Immigration\", which peaked about 1910 Some men moved back and forth across the Atlantic Ocean, but most were permanent settlers They moved into well-established communities, both urban and rural The German American communities spoke German, but their younger generation was bilingual [108] The Scandinavian groups generally assimilated quickly; they were noted for their support of reform programs, such as prohibition [109]\n\n\nNew immigrants\nThe \"New Immigration\" were much poorer peasants and rural folk from southern and eastern Europe, including mostly Italians, Poles, and Jews Some men, especially the Italians and Greeks, saw themselves as temporary migrants who planned to return to their home villages with a nest egg of cash earned in long hours of unskilled labor Others, especially the Jews, had been driven out of Eastern Europe and had no intention of returning [116]\n\n\nChinese immigrants\nChinese immigrants were hired by California construction companies for temporary railroad work European Americans strongly disliked the Chinese for their alien lifestyles and the threat of low wages The construction of the Central Pacific Railroad from California to Utah was handled largely by Chinese laborers In the 1870 census, there were 63,000 Chinese men, with a few women in the entire U.S.; this number grew to 106,000 in 1880 [119] Labor unions, led by Samuel Gompers strongly opposed the presence of Chinese labor Immigrants from China were not allowed to become citizens until 1950; however, as a result of the Supreme Court decision in United States v Wong Kim Ark, their children born in the U.S were full citizens [120]\n\n\nRural life\nA dramatic expansion in farming took place during the Gilded Age, [122] [123] with the number of farms tripling from 2.0 million in 1860 to 6.0 million in 1905 The number of people living on farms grew from about 10 million in 1860 to 22 million in 1880 to 31 million in 1905 The value of farms soared from $8.0 billion in 1860 to $30 billion in 1906 [124]\n\n\nUrban life\nAmerican society experienced significant changes in the period following the Civil War, most notably the rapid urbanization of the North [134] Due to the increasing demand for unskilled workers, most European immigrants went to mill towns, mining camps, and industrial cities New York, Philadelphia, and especially Chicago saw rapid growth Louis Sullivan became a noted architect using steel frames to construct skyscrapers for the first time while pioneering the idea of \"form follows function\" Chicago became the center of the skyscraper craze, starting with the ten-story Home Insurance Building in 1884–1885 by William Le Baron Jenney [135]\n\n\nThe South and the West\nThe South remained heavily rural and was much poorer than the North or West [142] In the South, Reconstruction brought major changes in agricultural practices The most significant of these was sharecropping, where tenant farmers \"shared\" up to half of their crop with the landowners, in exchange for seed and essential supplies About 80% of the Black farmers and 40% of White ones lived under this system after the Civil War Most sharecroppers were locked in a cycle of debt, from which the only hope of escape was increased planting This led to the over-production of cotton and tobacco (and thus to declining prices and income), soil exhaustion, and poverty among both landowners and tenants [143]\n\n\nThe South\nThe South remained heavily rural and was much poorer than the North or West [142] In the South, Reconstruction brought major changes in agricultural practices The most significant of these was sharecropping, where tenant farmers \"shared\" up to half of their crop with the landowners, in exchange for seed and essential supplies About 80% of the Black farmers and 40% of White ones lived under this system after the Civil War Most sharecroppers were locked in a cycle of debt, from which the only hope of escape was increased planting This led to the over-production of cotton and tobacco (and thus to declining prices and income), soil exhaustion, and poverty among both landowners and tenants [143]\n\n\nThe West\nIn 1869, the first transcontinental railroad—a combination of the Union Pacific from Omaha to Utah and the Central Pacific from Utah to California—opened up the far west mining and ranching regions Travel from New York to San Francisco now took six days instead of six months [150]\n\n\nFamily life\nIn the Gilded Age West, few single men attempted to operate a farm Farmers clearly understood the need for a hard-working wife, and numerous children, to handle the many chores, including child-rearing, feeding and clothing the family, managing the housework, and feeding the hired hands [152] During the early years of settlement, farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors After a generation or so, women increasingly left the fields, thus redefining their roles within the family New conveniences such as sewing and washing machines encouraged women to turn to domestic roles The scientific housekeeping movement was promoted across the land by the media and government extension agents, as well as county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning, advice columns for women in the farm papers, and home economics courses in schools [153]\n\n\nNative assimilation\nNative American policy was set by the national government (the states had very little role), and after 1865 the national policy was that Native Americans either had to assimilate into the larger community or remain on reservations, where the government provided subsidies Reservation natives were no longer allowed to roam or fight their traditional enemies The U.S Army was to enforce the laws Natives of the West came in conflict with expansion by miners, ranchers and settlers By 1880, the buffalo herds, a foundation for the hunting economy had disappeared Violence petered out in the 1880s and practically ceased after 1890 [161]\n\n\nArt\nSome well-known painters of the Gilded Age include: Jules Breton, Winslow Homer, Thomas Eakins, William Merritt Chase, John Singer Sargent, Mary Cassatt, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Childe Hassam, John Henry Twachtman, and Maurice Prendergast [163] [164]\n\n\nWomen's roles\nDuring the Gilded Age, many new social movements took hold in the United States Many women abolitionists who were disappointed that the Fifteenth Amendment did not extend voting rights to them, remained active in politics, this time focusing on issues important to them Reviving the temperance movement from the Second Great Awakening, many women joined the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in an attempt to bring morality back to America Its chief leader was Frances Willard (1839–1898), who had a national and international outreach from her base in Evanston, Illinois Often the WCTU women took up the issue of women's suffrage which had lain dormant since the Seneca Falls Convention With leaders like Susan B Anthony, the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) was formed to secure the right of women to vote [178]\n\n\nSocial activism\nDuring the Gilded Age, many new social movements took hold in the United States Many women abolitionists who were disappointed that the Fifteenth Amendment did not extend voting rights to them, remained active in politics, this time focusing on issues important to them Reviving the temperance movement from the Second Great Awakening, many women joined the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in an attempt to bring morality back to America Its chief leader was Frances

Seneca Falls Convention With leaders like Susan B Anthony, the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) was formed to secure the right of women to vote [178]\n\n\nEmployment\nMany young women worked as servants or in shops and factories until marriage, then typically became full-time housewives However, black, Irish and Swedish adult women often worked as servants In most large Northern cities, the Irish Catholic women dominated the market for servants [179] Heavy industry was a male domain, but in light industries such as textiles and food processing, large numbers of young women were hired Thousands of young unmarried Irish and French Canadian women worked in Northeastern textile mills Coming from poor families these jobs meant upward social mobility, more money, and more social prestige in their community that made them more attractive marriage partners In Cohoes, New York, mill women went on strike in 1882 to gain union recognition They fought off Swedish strike breakers to protect the status they had achieved [180]\n\n\nSocial thought\nA leading magazine, The Nation, espoused classical liberalism in every week's issue starting in 1865, under the influential editor E L Godkin (1831–1902) [188]\n\n\nReligion\nThe Third Great Awakening which began before the Civil War returned and made a significant change in religious attitudes toward social progress Followers of the new Awakening promoted the idea of the Social Gospel which gave rise to organizations such as the YMCA, the American branch of the Salvation Army, and settlement houses such as Hull House, founded by Jane Addams in Chicago in 1889 [190]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nHistoriography\n\n\nPrimary sources\n\n\nScholarly journals\n\n\nExternal

{"title": "Myanmar_protests_(2021–present)", "content": "\nBackground\nThe 2021 Myanmar coup d'état began on the morning of 1 February 2021 when democratically elected members of Myanmar's ruling party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), were deposed by the Tatmadaw – Myanmar's military – which vested power in a stratocracy, the State Administration Council The Tatmadaw declared a year-long state of emergency and declared power had been vested in Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Min Aung Hlaing The coup d'état occurred the day before the Parliament of Myanmar was due to swear in the members elected at the November 2020 general election, thereby preventing this from occurring [28] [29] [30] President Win Myint and State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi were detained, along with ministers and their deputies and members of Parliament [31] [32]\n\n\nRecognition of election outcomes\nRepresentatives elected in the November 2020 elections have not officially recognised the legitimacy of the coup d'état On 4 February 2021, around seventy MP-elects from the NLD took an oath of office in Naypyidaw, pledging to abide by the people's mandate, and serve as lawmakers for a five-year term [37] The following day, 300 elected legislators formed a committee to conduct parliamentary affairs, the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH) [38] [39] The committee held its first session on Zoom [40]\n\n\nCampaigns and strikes\nMyanmar has a long history of contentious collective action and a varied repertoire of protest Soon after the coup, protesters deployed a number of inherited forms of political action that are \nhistorically and culturally specific to Myanmar But they also developed innovative tactics and strategies borrowed from global repertoires of contention [45]\n\n\nCivil Disobedience Movement and labour strikes\nOn 2 February 2021, healthcare workers and civil servants across the country, including in the national capital, Naypyidaw, launched a national civil disobedience movement (အာဏာဖီဆန်ရေးလှုပ်ရှားမှု), in opposition to the coup d'état [46] [47] A Facebook campaign group dubbed the \"Civil Disobedience Movement\" has attracted more than 230,000 followers, since its initial launch on 2 February 2021 [48] [49] [50] Min Ko Naing, an Uprising leader, has urged the public to adopt a \"no recognition, no participation\" stance to the military regime [51] One expert on the government's civil service system estimated that the country had about one million civil servants and that about three-quarters of them had walked

Austin required a congressional waiver of the National Security Act of 1947 to bypass the ten-year waiting period after leaving active-duty military, as prescribed by 10 U.S.C. § 113 (a), in order to be appointed as secretary of defense [61] Austin's nomination, and the attendant requirement for a waiver, met with some concern in Congress regarding its implications for civil–military relations [63] [64] Former secretary of defense Robert Gates and former secretary of state Colin Powell, among others, issued statements supporting Austin's nomination [65]\n\n\nTenure\n\nUpon assuming the office, Austin announced his top three priorities for the Defense Department in a memorandum issued to all DoD employees It stated in part: \n\nFailure to disclose hospitalization\nOn January 1, 2024, Austin was hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center due to complications following a minimally invasive surgical procedure conducted on December 22, 2023, to address his prostate cancer (prostatectomy) [79] On January 2, Austin began experiencing fever and chills and shallow breathing The medical staff decided to transfer him to the critical-care unit for closer monitoring and better team care by his doctors [80] Austin spent several days in Walter Reed's intensive care unit (ICU) and during that time delegated authority to the deputy secretary of defense Kathleen Hicks On January 5, he resumed his functions and duties as secretary of defense from the hospital [80] The cancer was treated early, and Austin's doctors have stated that his prognosis is \"excellent\" [81] [82]\n\n\nExtremism in the ranks\nConcerns of possible right-wing extremism among the troops caused Austin to implement new training requirements On February 5, 2021, Austin announced that all members of the United States military would be required to stand down within the next 60 days in order to conduct training The training includes the importance of the oath of office, a review of impermissible behaviors, and procedures for reporting suspected or actual extremist behavior [92] [93] [94]\n\n\nMiddle East\nThroughout his tenure, Austin has engaged with civil and military leaders in the Middle East, reinforcing the United States' commitment to partnerships and security in the region Areas for collaboration between the U.S and allies include integrated air and missile defense, maritime security, intelligence sharing and early warning systems [95]\n\n\nIran\nDuring a visit to Israel in March 2023, in a joint press conference with Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant, Austin said: \"Iran remains the primary driver of instability in the region and we remain deeply concerned by Iran's support for terrorism, its dangerous proxies, its nuclear advances, its aggression at sea, its cyber threats, and its proliferation of attack drones and advanced conventional weapons.\" [101]\n\n\nCombatting terrorism\n\nDuring his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on March 28, 2023, Austin stated: \n\nIsrael\nIn January 2023, Austin declared that \"America's commitment to Israel's security is ironclad It is not negotiable And it never will be.\" [97]\n\n\nIndo-Pacific\nIn his testimony before the House Armed Services Committee on March 29, 2023, Austin said: \"The PRC is our pacing challenge And we're driving hard to meet it Our budget builds on our previous investments to deter aggression We're investing in a more resilient force posture in the Indo-Pacific and increasing the scale and the scope of our exercises with our partners.\n\n\nAfghanistan\nOn February 19, 2021, Austin told reporters at the Pentagon that the Biden Administration had not yet determined whether the U.S would withdraw all troops from Afghanistan by the May 1 deadline set by the Trump administration in February 2020 as part of the Doha Agreement, a deal reached between the United States and the Taliban [161] The Biden administration was considering a six-month extension [162] Austin promised that the United States \"will not undertake a hasty or disorderly withdrawal from Afghanistan.\" [163] On March 21, 2021, Austin met with Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani in Kabul [164]\n\n\nUkraine\nOn February 24, 2022, Russian president Vladimir Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine, stating the \"special military operation\" is aimed at \"demilitarization\" and \"denazification\" of the country to protect ethnic Russians, prevent Kyiv's NATO membership and to keep it in Russia's \"sphere of influence\" [177] During the invasion, the U.S sent tens of billions of dollars in missiles, ammunition and other items to Ukraine [178] Austin said that he wanted to see \"Russia weakened to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine\" [179] Austin said he \"does not\" believe that Russia's invasion of Ukraine will result in a nuclear war [180]\n\n\nAfrica\nIn September 2023, Austin made his first trip to Africa as secretary of defense He started his tour in Djibouti, home to the primary U.S military base on the African continent, Camp Lemonnier, where he met with Djibouti's president Ismaïl Omar Guelleh and Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud He then traveled to Kenya, where he and Kenyan Defense Minister Aden Duale signed a five-year security agreement to support working together against their common terror threat Austin also pledged $100 million in support of Kenyan security deployments, as Kenya prepares to lead a multinational peacekeeping mission to Haiti to combat gang violence He concluded his trip on Africa's western coast, becoming the first U.S defense secretary to ever visit Angola [216]\n\n\nPersonal life\nAustin was raised by a devoutly Catholic mother and remains practicing himself [218] [219]\n\n\nAwards and decorations\n\n\nPublications\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nGeneral sources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal

Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States The start of the Cold War between 1947 and 1953 saw an ideological and economic divide between the capitalist states of Western Europe backed by United States with its Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine, and the communist states of Eastern Europe, backed by the Soviet Union As such, opposition to Soviet-style communism became a defining characteristic of the organization and the anti-communist governments of Greece, which had just fought a civil war against a pro-communist army, and Turkey, whose newly-elected Democrat Party were staunchly pro-American, came under internal and external pressure to join the alliance, which both did in February 1952 [8] [9]\n\n\nCold War\nTwelve countries were part of NATO at the time of its founding: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States The start of the Cold War between 1947 and 1953 saw an ideological and economic divide between the capitalist states of Western Europe backed by United States with its Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine, and the communist states of

just fought a civil war against a pro-communist army, and Turkey, whose newly-elected Democrat Party were staunchly pro-American, came under internal and external pressure to join the alliance, which both did in February 1952 [8] [9]\n\n\nGerman reunification\nNegotiations to reunite East and West Germany took place throughout 1990, resulting in the signing of the Two Plus Four Treaty in September 1990 and East Germany officially joining the Federal Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990 To secure Soviet approval of a united Germany remaining in NATO, the treaty prohibited foreign troops and nuclear weapons from being stationed in the former East Germany, [22] though an addendum signed by all parties specified that foreign NATO troops could be deployed east of the Cold War line after the Soviet departure at the discretion of the government of a united Germany [23] [24] There is no mention of NATO expansion into any other country in the September–October 1990 agreements on German reunification [25] Whether or not representatives from NATO member states informally committed to not enlarge NATO into other parts of Eastern Europe during these and contemporary negotiations with Soviet counterparts has long been a matter of dispute among historians and international relations scholars [26] [27]\n\n\nVisegrád Group\nIn February 1991, Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia formed the Visegrád Group to push for European integration under the European Union and NATO, as well as to conduct military reforms in line with NATO standards Internal NATO reaction to these former Warsaw Pact countries was initially negative, but by the 1991 Rome summit in November, members agreed to a series of goals that could lead to accession, such as market and democratic liberalization, and that NATO should be a partner in these efforts Debate within the American government as to whether enlargement of NATO was feasible or desirable began during the George H.W Bush administration [44] By mid-1992, a consensus emerged within the administration that NATO enlargement was a wise realpolitik measure to strengthen Euro-American hegemony [44] [45] In the absence of NATO enlargement, Bush administration officials worried that the European Union might fill the security vacuum in Central Europe, and thus challenge American post-Cold War influence [44] There was further debate during the Presidency of Bill Clinton between a rapid offer of full membership to several select countries versus a slower, more limited membership to a wide range of states over a longer time span Victory by the Republican Party, which advocated for aggressive expansion, in the 1994 US congressional election helped sway US policy in favor of wider full-membership enlargement, which the US ultimately pursued in the following years [46] In 1996, Clinton called for former Warsaw Pact countries and post-Soviet republics to join NATO, and made NATO enlargement a part of his foreign policy [47]\n\n\nVilnius Group\nAt the 1999 Washington summit NATO issued new guidelines for membership with individualized \"Membership Action Plans\" for Albania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia in order to standardize the process for new members [59] In May 2000, these countries joined with Croatia to form the Vilnius Group in order to cooperate and lobby for common NATO membership, and by the 2002 Prague summit seven were invited for membership, which took place at the 2004 Istanbul summit [60] Slovenia had held a referendum on NATO the previous year, with 66% approving of membership [61]\n\n\nAdriatic Charter\nCroatia also started a Membership Action Plan at the 2002 summit, but was not included in the 2004 enlargement In May 2003, it joined with Albania and Macedonia to form the Adriatic Charter to support each other in their pursuit of membership [66] Croatia's prospect of membership sparked a national debate on whether a referendum on NATO membership needed to be held before joining the organization Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader ultimately agreed in January 2008, as part of forming a coalition government with the HSS and HSLS parties, not to officially propose one [67] Albania and Croatia were invited to join NATO at the 2008 Bucharest summit that April, though Slovenia threatened to hold up Croatian membership over their border dispute in the Bay of Piran [68] Slovenia did ratify Croatia's accession protocol in February 2009, [69] before Croatia and Albania both officially joined NATO just before the 2009 Strasbourg–Kehl summit, with little opposition from Russia [70]\n\n\nFinland and Sweden\nIn 1949, Sweden chose not to join NATO and declared a security policy aiming for non-alignment in peace and neutrality in war [87] This position was maintained without much discussion during the Cold War  During this time, Finland's relationship with NATO and the Soviet Union followed the Paasikivi–Kekkonen doctrine, whereby the country joined neither the Western nor Eastern blocs  Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, both countries joined NATO's Partnership for Peace in 1994 and provided peacekeeping forces to various NATO missions, including Kosovo (KFOR) and Afghanistan (ISAF) in the early 2000s [88] [89] [90] [91]\n\n\nSummary table and

basis of the organization, and, as such, any changes including new membership requires ratification by all current signers of the treaty The treaty's Article 10 describes how non-member states may join NATO:\n\n\nMembership Action Plan\nThe biggest step in the formalization of the process for inviting new members came at the 1999 Washington summit when the Membership Action Plan (MAP) mechanism was approved as a stage for the current members to regularly review the formal applications of aspiring members A country's participation in MAP entails the annual presentation of reports concerning its progress on five different measures: [123]\n\n\nIntensified dialogue\nIntensified Dialogue was first introduced in April 2005 at an informal meeting of foreign ministers in Vilnius, Lithuania, as a response to Ukrainian aspirations for NATO membership and related reforms taking place under President Viktor Yushchenko, and which followed the 2002 signing of the NATO–Ukraine Action Plan under his predecessor, Leonid Kuchma [124] This formula, which includes discussion of a \"full range of political, military, financial and security issues relating to possible NATO membership .. had its roots in the 1997 Madrid summit\", where the participants had agreed \"to continue the Alliance's intensified dialogs with those nations that aspire to NATO membership or that otherwise wish to pursue a dialog with NATO on membership questions\" [130]\n\n\nAspiring members\nAs of 2024 [update], three states have formally expressed their desire to join NATO Bosnia and Herzegovina is the only country with a Membership Action Plan, which together with Georgia, were named NATO \"aspirant countries\" at the North Atlantic Council meeting on 7 December 2011 [135] Ukraine was recognized as an aspirant country after the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, and formally applied for membership in 2022 following its invasion by Russia.\n\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina\nThe 1995 NATO bombing of Bosnia and Herzegovina targeted the Bosnian Serb Army and together with international pressure led to the resolution of the Bosnian War and the signing of the Dayton Agreement in 1995 Since then, NATO has led the Implementation Force and Stabilization Force, and other peacekeeping efforts in the country Bosnia and Herzegovina joined the Partnership for Peace in 2006, and signed an agreement on security cooperation in March 2007 [150] Bosnia and Herzegovina began further cooperation with NATO within its Individual Partnership Action Plan in January 2008 [140] The country then started the process of Intensified Dialogue at the 2008 Bucharest summit [141] The country was invited to join the Adriatic Charter of NATO aspirants in September 2008 [151]\n\n\nUkraine\nUkraine's relationship with NATO has been politically divisive, and is part of a larger debate over Ukraine's ties to both the European Union and Russia Ukraine established ties to the alliance with a NATO–Ukraine Action Plan in November 2002, [146] [162] joined NATO's Partnership for Peace in February 2005, [163] then entered into the Intensified Dialogue program with NATO in April 2005 [164]\n\n\nGeorgia\nGeorgia moved quickly following the Rose Revolution in 2003 to seek closer ties with NATO [193]  (although the previous administration had also indicated that it desired NATO membership a year before the revolution took place [194]) Georgia's northern neighbor, Russia, opposed the closer ties, including those expressed at the 2008 Bucharest summit, where NATO members promised that Georgia would eventually join the organization [195] Complications in the relationship between NATO and Georgia includes the presence of Russian military forces in internationally recognized Georgian territory as a result of multiple recent conflicts, like the 2008 Russo-Georgian War over the territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, both of which are home to a large number of citizens of Russia On 3 December 2008, NATO's 26 foreign ministers voted to reject a Membership Action Plan (MAP) to Georgia, arguing that it would antagonize Russia and that Georgia needed to enact more reforms [196] On 21 November 2011, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev while addressing soldiers in Vladikavkaz near the Georgian border stated that Russia's 2008 invasion had prevented any further NATO enlargement into the former Soviet sphere [195]\n\n\nMembership debates\nThe Soviet Union was the primary ideological adversary for NATO during the Cold War Following its dissolution, several states which had maintained neutrality during the Cold War or were post-Soviet states increased their ties with Western institutions; a number of them requested to join NATO The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine reignited debate surrounding NATO membership in several countries.\n\n\nAustria\nAustria was occupied by the four victorious Allied powers following World War II under the Allied Control Council, similar to Germany During negotiations to end of the occupation, which were ongoing at the same time as Germany's, the Soviet Union insisted that the reunified country adopt the model of Swiss neutrality The US feared that this would encourage West Germany to accept similar Soviet proposals for neutrality as a condition for German reunification [213] Shortly after West Germany's accession to NATO, the parties agreed to the Austrian State Treaty in May 1955, which was largely based on the Moscow Memorandum signed the previous month between Austria and the Soviet Union While the treaty itself did not commit Austria to neutrality, this was subsequently enshrined into Austria's constitution that October with the Declaration of Neutrality The Declaration prohibits Austria from joining a military alliance, from hosting foreign military bases within its borders, and from participating in a war [214]\n\n\nCyprus\nPrior to gaining its independence in 1960, Cyprus was a crown colony of the United Kingdom and as such the UK's NATO membership also applied to British Cyprus The Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia in Cyprus remained under British control as a British Overseas Territory following independence [225] Neighbouring Greece and Turkey competed for influence in the newly independent Cyprus, with intercommunal rivalries and movements for union with Greece or partition and partial union with Turkey The first President of the independent Republic of Cyprus (1960–1977), Archbishop of Cyprus Makarios III, adopted a policy of non-alignment and took part in the 1961 founding meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement in Belgrade.\n\n\nIreland\nIreland was neutral during World War II, though the country cooperated with Allied intelligence and permitted the Allies use of Irish airways and ports Ireland continued its policy of military neutrality during the Cold War, and after it ended, joined NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) program and Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) in 1999 [233] Ireland supplied a small number of troops to the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan (2001–2014) and supports the ongoing NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) [234] [235] Former Secretary General of NATO Anders Fogh Rasmussen said during a visit to the country in 2013 that the \"door is open\" for Ireland to join NATO at any time [236]\n\n\nKosovo\nAccording to Minister of Foreign Affairs Enver Hoxhaj, integration with NATO is a priority for Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008 [249] Kosovo submitted an application to join the PfP program in July 2012, [250] and Hoxhaj stated in 2014 that the country's goal is to be a NATO member by 2022 [251] In December 2018, Kosovar Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj stated that Kosovo will apply for NATO membership after the formation of the Kosovo Armed Forces [252] Kosovo's lack of recognition by four NATO member states—Greece, Romania, Spain, and Slovakia—could impede its accession [253] [250] United Nations membership, which Kosovo does not have, is considered to be necessary for NATO membership [254]\n\n\nMalta\nWhen the North Atlantic Treaty was signed in 1949, the Mediterranean island of Malta was a dependent territory of the United Kingdom, one of the treaty's original signatories As such, the Crown Colony of Malta shared the UK's international memberships, including NATO Between 1952 and 1965, the headquarters of the Allied Forces Mediterranean was based in the town of Floriana, just outside Malta's capital of Valletta When Malta gained independence in 1964, prime minister George Borg Olivier wanted the country to join NATO Olivier was concerned that the presence of the NATO headquarters in Malta, without the security guarantees that NATO membership entailed, made the country a potential target However, according to a memorandum he prepared at the time he was discouraged from formally submitting a membership application by Deputy Secretary General of NATO James A Roberts It was believed that some NATO members, including the United Kingdom, were opposed to Maltese NATO membership As a result Olivier considered alternatives, such as seeking associate membership or unilateral security guarantees from NATO, or closing the NATO headquarters in Malta in retaliation [257] [258] [259] Ultimately, Olivier supported the alliance and signed a defense agreement with the UK for use of Maltese military facilities in exchange for around £2 million a year [260] [261]\n\n\nMoldova\nMoldova gained independence in 1991 following the collapse of the Soviet Union The country's current constitution was adopted in 1994, and forbids the country from joining a military alliance, but some politicians, such as former Moldovan Minister of Defence Vitalie Marinuța, have suggested joining NATO as part of a larger European integration Moldova joined NATO's Partnership for Peace in 1994, and initiated an Individual Partnership Action Plan in 2010 [268] Moldova also participates in NATO's peacekeeping force in Kosovo [269] Following the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia, NATO officials warned that Russia might seek to annex Transnistria, a breakaway Moldovan region [270] This separatist issue could preclude Moldova from joining NATO [268]\n\n\nSerbia\nYugoslavia's communist government sided with the Eastern Bloc at the beginning of the Cold War, but pursued a policy of neutrality following the Tito–Stalin split in 1948 [275] It was a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1961 Since that country's dissolution most of its successor states have joined NATO, but the largest of them, Serbia, has maintained Yugoslavia's policy of neutrality.\n\n\nOther proposals\nSome individuals have proposed expanding NATO outside of Europe, although doing so would require amending Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which specifically limits new membership to \"any other European State in a position to further the principles of this Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area.\" [292]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Enlargement of NATO**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has undergone significant changes since its founding in 1949. The organization has expanded its membership several times, with the most recent expansion taking place in 2020. In this article, we will discuss the history of NATO's enlargement, the criteria for membership, and the current process of expansion.\n\n**Past Enlargements**\n\nTwelve countries were part of NATO at the time of its founding: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The start of the Cold War between 1947 and 1953 saw an ideological and economic divide between the capitalist states of Western Europe backed by the United States with its Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine, and the communist states of Eastern Europe, backed by the Soviet Union.

During this time, NATO's primary goal was to counter the Soviet Union's military expansion and to prevent the spread of communism in Europe. The alliance played a crucial role in the Korean War and the Cuban Missile Crisis, and it also provided a framework for cooperation and coordination among its member states.\n\n**German Reunification**\n\nNegotiations to reunite East and West Germany took place throughout 1990, resulting in the signing of the Two Plus Four Treaty in September 1990 and East Germany officially joining the Federal Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990.

The treaty's Article 10 describes how non-member states may join NATO.\n\n**Criteria and Process**\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty is the basis of the organization, and, as such, any changes including new membership requires ratification by all current signers of the treaty. The treaty's Article 10 describes how non-member states may join NATO. The Membership Action Plan (MAP) mechanism was approved as a stage for the current members to regularly review the formal applications of aspiring members.\n\n**Membership Action Plan**\n\nThe Membership Action Plan (MAP) was introduced in 1999 as a stage for the current members to regularly review the formal applications of aspiring members. A country's participation in MAP entails the annual presentation of reports concerning its progress on five different measures.\n\n**Intensified Dialogue**\n\nIntensified Dialogue was first introduced in April 2005 at an informal meeting of foreign ministers in Vilnius, Lithuania, as a response to Ukrainian aspirations for NATO membership and related reforms taking place under President Viktor Yushchenko.\n\n**Aspiring Members**\n\nAs of 2024, three states have formally expressed their desire to join NATO: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, and Ukraine. Bosnia and Herzegovina is the only country with a Membership Action Plan, which together with Georgia, were named NATO \"aspirant countries\" at the North Atlantic Council meeting on 7 December 2011.\n\n**Bosnia and Herzegovina**\n\nThe 1995 NATO bombing of Bosnia and Herzegovina targeted the Bosnian Serb Army and together with international pressure led to the resolution of the Bosnian War and the signing of the Dayton Agreement in 1995. Since then, NATO has led the Implementation Force and Stabilization Force, and other peacekeeping efforts in the country.\n\n**Ukraine**\n\nUkraine's relationship with NATO has been politically divisive, and is part of a larger debate over Ukraine's ties to both the European Union and Russia. Ukraine established ties to the alliance with a NATO–Ukraine Action Plan in November 2002.\n\n**Georgia**\n\nGeorgia moved quickly following the Rose Revolution in 2003 to seek closer ties with NATO. Georgia's northern neighbor, Russia, opposed the closer ties, including those expressed at the 2008 Bucharest summit, where NATO members promised that Georgia would eventually join the organization.\n\n**Membership Debates**\n\nThe Soviet Union was the primary ideological adversary for NATO during the Cold War. Following its dissolution, several states which had maintained neutrality during the Cold War or were post-Soviet states increased their ties with Western institutions; a number of them requested to join NATO. The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine reignited debate surrounding NATO membership in several countries.\n\n**Austria**\n\nAustria was occupied by the four victorious Allied powers following World War II under the Allied Control Council, similar to Germany. During negotiations to end of the occupation, which were ongoing at the same time as Germany's, the Soviet Union insisted that the reunified country adopt the model of Swiss neutrality.\n\n**Cyprus**\n\nPrior to gaining its independence in 1960, Cyprus was a crown colony of the United Kingdom and as such the UK's NATO membership also applied to British Cyprus. The Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia in Cyprus remained under British control as a British Overseas Territory following independence.\n\n**Ireland**\n\nIreland was neutral during World War II, though the country cooperated with Allied intelligence and permitted the Allies use of Irish airways and ports. Ireland continued its policy of military neutrality during the Cold War, and after it ended, joined NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) program and Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) in 1999.\n\n**Kosovo**\n\nAccording to Minister of Foreign Affairs Enver Hoxhaj, integration with NATO is a priority for Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008. Kosovo submitted an application to join the PfP program in July 2012.\n\n**Malta**\n\nWhen the North Atlantic Treaty was signed in 1949, the Mediterranean island of Malta was a dependent territory of the United Kingdom, one of the treaty's original signatories. As such, the Crown Colony of Malta shared the UK's international memberships, including NATO.\n\n**Moldova**\n\nMoldova gained independence in 1991 following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The country's current constitution was adopted in 1994, and forbids the country from joining a military alliance, but some politicians, such as former Moldovan Minister of Defence Vitalie Marinuța, have suggested joining NATO as part of a larger European integration.\n\n**Serbia**\n\nYugoslavia's communist government sided with the Eastern Bloc at the beginning of the Cold War, but pursued a policy of neutrality following the Tito–Stalin split in 1948. It was a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1961.\n\n**Other Proposals**\n\nSome individuals have proposed expanding NATO outside of Europe, although doing so would require amending Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which specifically limits new membership to \"any other European State in a position to further the principles of this Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area.\"\n\n**See Also**\n\n* North Atlantic Treaty\n* NATO Enlargement\n* European Integration\n* Cold War\n* Security Policy\n* Military Alliance\n\n**References**\n\n* NATO Official Website\n* European Union Official Website\n* Cold War Museum\n* Security Policy Institute\n* Military Alliance Research Center\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* \"NATO Enlargement: A Critical Analysis\" by J.

complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Enlargement_of_NATO\" following this outline:\n\n\nPast enlargements\nTwelve countries were part of NATO at the time of its founding: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States The start of the Cold War between 1947 and 1953 saw an ideological and economic divide between the capitalist states of Western Europe backed by United States with its Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine, and the communist states of Eastern Europe, backed by the Soviet Union As such, opposition to Soviet-style communism became a defining characteristic of the organization and the anti-communist governments of Greece, which had just fought a civil war against a pro-communist army, and Turkey, whose newly-elected Democrat Party were staunchly pro-American, came under internal and external pressure to join the alliance, which both did in February 1952 [8] [9]\n\n\nCold War\nTwelve countries were part of NATO at the time of its founding: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States The start of the Cold War between 1947 and 1953 saw an ideological and economic divide between the capitalist states of Western Europe backed by United States with its Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine, and the communist states of Eastern Europe, backed by the Soviet Union As such, opposition to Soviet-style communism became a defining characteristic of the organization and the anti-communist governments of Greece, which had just fought a civil war against a pro-communist army, and Turkey, whose newly-elected Democrat Party were staunchly pro-American, came under internal and external pressure to join the alliance, which both did in February 1952 [8] [9]\n\n\nGerman reunification\nNegotiations to reunite East and West Germany took place throughout 1990, resulting in the signing of the Two Plus Four Treaty in September 1990 and East Germany officially joining the Federal Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990 To secure Soviet approval of a united Germany remaining in NATO, the treaty prohibited foreign troops and nuclear weapons from being stationed in the former East Germany, [22] though an addendum signed by all parties specified that foreign NATO troops could be deployed east of the Cold War line after the Soviet departure at the discretion of the government of a united Germany [23] [24] There is no mention of NATO expansion into any other country in the September–October 1990 agreements on German reunification [25] Whether or not representatives from NATO member states informally committed to not enlarge NATO into other parts of Eastern Europe during these and contemporary negotiations with Soviet counterparts has long been a matter of dispute among historians and international relations scholars [26] [27]\n\n\nVisegrád Group\nIn February 1991, Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia formed the Visegrád Group to push for European integration under the European Union and NATO, as well as to conduct military reforms in line with NATO standards Internal NATO reaction to these former Warsaw Pact countries was initially negative, but by the 1991 Rome summit in November, members agreed to a series of goals that could lead to accession, such as market and democratic liberalization, and that NATO should be a partner in these efforts Debate within the American government as to whether enlargement of NATO was feasible or desirable began during the George H.W Bush administration [44] By mid-1992, a consensus emerged within the administration that NATO enlargement was a wise realpolitik measure to strengthen Euro-American hegemony [44] [45] In the absence of NATO enlargement, Bush administration officials worried that the European Union might fill the security vacuum in Central Europe, and thus challenge American post-Cold War influence [44] There was further debate during the Presidency of Bill Clinton between a rapid offer of full membership to several select countries versus a slower, more limited membership to a wide range of states over a longer time span Victory by the Republican Party, which advocated for aggressive expansion, in the 1994 US congressional election helped sway US policy in favor of wider full-membership enlargement, which the US ultimately pursued in the following years [46] In 1996, Clinton called for former Warsaw Pact countries and post-Soviet republics to join NATO, and made NATO enlargement a part of his foreign policy [47]\n\n\nVilnius Group\nAt the 1999 Washington summit NATO issued new guidelines for membership with individualized \"Membership Action Plans\" for Albania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia in order to standardize the process for new members [59] In May 2000, these countries joined with Croatia to form the Vilnius Group in order to cooperate and lobby for common NATO membership, and by the 2002 Prague summit seven were invited for membership, which took place at the 2004 Istanbul summit [60] Slovenia had held a referendum on NATO the previous year, with 66% approving of membership [61]\n\n\nAdriatic Charter\nCroatia also started a Membership Action Plan at the 2002 summit, but was not included in the 2004 enlargement In May 2003, it joined with Albania and Macedonia to form the Adriatic Charter to support each other in their pursuit of membership [66] Croatia's prospect of membership sparked a national debate on whether a referendum on NATO membership needed to be held before joining the organization Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader ultimately agreed in January 2008, as part of forming a coalition government with the HSS and HSLS parties, not to officially propose one [67] Albania and Croatia were invited to join NATO at the 2008 Bucharest summit that April, though Slovenia threatened to hold up Croatian membership over their border dispute in the Bay of Piran [68] Slovenia did ratify Croatia's accession protocol in February 2009, [69] before Croatia and Albania both officially joined NATO just before the 2009 Strasbourg–Kehl summit, with little opposition from Russia [70]\n\n\nFinland and Sweden\nIn 1949, Sweden chose not to join NATO and declared a security policy aiming for non-alignment in peace and neutrality in war [87] This position was maintained without much discussion during the Cold War  During this time, Finland's relationship with NATO and the Soviet Union followed the Paasikivi–Kekkonen doctrine, whereby the country joined neither the Western nor Eastern blocs  Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, both countries joined NATO's Partnership for Peace in 1994 and provided peacekeeping forces to various NATO missions, including Kosovo (KFOR) and Afghanistan (ISAF) in the early 2000s [88] [89] [90] [91]\n\n\nSummary table and map\nThe North Atlantic Treaty is the basis of the organization, and, as such, any changes including new membership requires ratification by all current signers of the

new membership requires ratification by all current signers of the treaty The treaty's Article 10 describes how non-member states may join NATO:\n\n\nArticle 10 and the Open Door Policy\nThe North Atlantic Treaty is the basis of the organization, and, as such, any changes including new membership requires ratification by all current signers of the treaty The treaty's Article 10 describes how non-member states may join NATO:\n\n\nMembership Action Plan\nThe biggest step in the formalization of the process for inviting new members came at the 1999 Washington summit when the Membership Action Plan (MAP) mechanism was approved as a stage for the current members to regularly review the formal applications of aspiring members A country's participation in MAP entails the annual presentation of reports concerning its progress on five different measures: [123]\n\n\nIntensified dialogue\nIntensified Dialogue was first introduced in April 2005 at an informal meeting of foreign ministers in Vilnius, Lithuania, as a response to Ukrainian aspirations for NATO membership and related reforms taking place under President Viktor Yushchenko, and which followed the 2002 signing of the NATO–Ukraine Action Plan under his predecessor, Leonid Kuchma [124] This formula, which includes discussion of a \"full range of political, military, financial and security issues relating to possible NATO membership .. had its roots in the 1997 Madrid summit\", where the participants had agreed \"to continue the Alliance's intensified dialogs with those nations that aspire to NATO membership or that otherwise wish to pursue a dialog with NATO on membership questions\" [130]\n\n\nAspiring members\nAs of 2024 [update], three states have formally expressed their desire to join NATO Bosnia and Herzegovina is the only country with a Membership Action Plan, which together with Georgia, were named NATO \"aspirant countries\" at the North Atlantic Council meeting on 7 December 2011 [135] Ukraine was recognized as an aspirant country after the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, and formally applied for membership in 2022 following its invasion by Russia.\n\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina\nThe 1995 NATO bombing of Bosnia and Herzegovina targeted the Bosnian Serb Army and together with international pressure led to the resolution of the Bosnian War and the signing of the Dayton Agreement in 1995 Since then, NATO has led the Implementation Force and Stabilization Force, and other peacekeeping efforts in the country Bosnia and Herzegovina joined the Partnership for Peace in 2006, and signed an agreement on security cooperation in March 2007 [150] Bosnia and Herzegovina began further cooperation with NATO within its Individual Partnership Action Plan in January 2008 [140] The country then started the process of Intensified Dialogue at the 2008 Bucharest summit [141] The country was invited to join the Adriatic Charter of NATO aspirants in September 2008 [151]\n\n\nUkraine\nUkraine's relationship with NATO has been politically divisive, and is part of a larger debate over Ukraine's ties to both the European Union and Russia Ukraine established ties to the alliance with a NATO–Ukraine Action Plan in November 2002, [146] [162] joined NATO's Partnership for Peace in February 2005, [163] then entered into the Intensified Dialogue program with NATO in April 2005 [164]\n\n\nGeorgia\nGeorgia moved quickly following the Rose Revolution in 2003 to seek closer ties with NATO [193]  (although the previous administration had also indicated that it desired NATO membership a year before the revolution took place [194]) Georgia's northern neighbor, Russia, opposed the closer ties, including those expressed at the 2008 Bucharest summit, where NATO members promised that Georgia would eventually join the organization [195] Complications in the relationship between NATO and Georgia includes the presence of Russian military forces in internationally recognized Georgian territory as a result of multiple recent conflicts, like the 2008 Russo-Georgian War over the territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, both of which are home to a large number of citizens of Russia On 3 December 2008, NATO's 26 foreign ministers voted to reject a Membership Action Plan (MAP) to Georgia, arguing that it would antagonize Russia and that Georgia needed to enact more reforms [196] On 21 November 2011, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev while addressing soldiers in Vladikavkaz near the Georgian border stated that Russia's 2008 invasion had prevented any further NATO enlargement into the former Soviet sphere [195]\n\n\nMembership debates\nThe Soviet Union was the primary ideological adversary for NATO during the Cold War Following its dissolution, several states which had maintained neutrality during the Cold War or were post-Soviet states increased their ties with Western institutions; a number of them requested to join NATO The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine reignited debate surrounding NATO membership in several countries.\n\n\nAustria\nAustria was occupied by the four victorious Allied powers following World War II under the Allied Control Council, similar to Germany During negotiations to end of the occupation, which were ongoing at the same time as Germany's, the Soviet Union insisted that the reunified country adopt the model of Swiss neutrality The US feared that this would encourage West Germany to accept similar Soviet proposals for neutrality as a condition for German reunification [213] Shortly after West Germany's accession to NATO, the parties agreed to the Austrian State Treaty in May 1955, which was largely based on the Moscow Memorandum signed the previous month between Austria and the Soviet Union While the treaty itself did not commit Austria to neutrality, this was subsequently enshrined into Austria's constitution that October with the Declaration of Neutrality The Declaration prohibits Austria from joining a military alliance, from hosting foreign military bases within its borders, and from participating in a war [214]\n\n\nCyprus\nPrior to gaining its independence in 1960, Cyprus was a crown colony of the United Kingdom and as such the UK's NATO membership also applied to British Cyprus The Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia in Cyprus remained under British control as a British Overseas Territory following independence [225] Neighbouring Greece and Turkey competed for influence in the newly independent Cyprus, with intercommunal rivalries and movements for union with Greece or partition and partial union with Turkey The first President of the independent Republic of Cyprus (1960–1977), Archbishop of Cyprus Makarios III, adopted a policy of non-alignment and took part in the 1961 founding meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement in Belgrade.\n\n\nIreland\nIreland was neutral during World War II, though the country cooperated with Allied intelligence and permitted the Allies use of Irish airways and ports Ireland continued its policy of military neutrality during the Cold War, and after it ended, joined NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) program and Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) in 1999 [233] Ireland supplied a small number of troops to the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan (2001–2014) and supports the ongoing NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) [234] [235] Former Secretary General of NATO Anders Fogh Rasmussen said during a visit to the country in 2013 that the \"door is open\" for Ireland to join NATO at any time [236]\n\n\nKosovo\nAccording to Minister of Foreign Affairs Enver Hoxhaj, integration with NATO is a priority for Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008 [249] Kosovo submitted an application to join the PfP program in July 2012, [250] and Hoxhaj stated in 2014 that the country's goal is to be a NATO member by 2022 [251] In December 2018, Kosovar Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj stated that Kosovo will apply for NATO membership after the formation of the Kosovo Armed Forces [252] Kosovo's lack of recognition by four NATO member states—Greece, Romania, Spain, and Slovakia—could impede its accession [253] [250] United Nations membership, which Kosovo does not have, is considered to be necessary for NATO membership [254]\n\n\nMalta\nWhen the North Atlantic Treaty was signed in 1949, the Mediterranean island of Malta was a dependent territory of the United Kingdom, one of the treaty's original signatories As such, the Crown Colony of Malta shared the UK's international memberships, including NATO Between 1952 and 1965, the headquarters of the Allied Forces Mediterranean was based in the town of Floriana, just outside Malta's capital of Valletta When Malta gained independence in 1964, prime minister George Borg Olivier wanted the country to join NATO Olivier was concerned that the presence of the NATO headquarters in Malta, without the security guarantees that NATO membership entailed, made the country a potential target However, according to a memorandum he prepared at the time he was discouraged from formally submitting a membership application by Deputy Secretary General of NATO James A Roberts It was believed that some NATO members, including the United Kingdom, were opposed to Maltese NATO membership As a result Olivier considered alternatives, such as seeking associate membership or unilateral security guarantees from NATO, or closing the NATO headquarters in Malta in retaliation [257] [258] [259] Ultimately, Olivier supported the alliance and signed a defense agreement with the UK for use of Maltese military facilities in exchange for around £2 million a year [260] [261]\n\n\nMoldova\nMoldova gained independence in 1991 following the collapse of the Soviet Union The country's current constitution was adopted in 1994, and forbids the country from joining a military alliance, but some politicians, such as former Moldovan Minister of Defence Vitalie Marinuța, have suggested joining NATO as part of a larger European integration Moldova joined NATO's Partnership for Peace in 1994, and initiated an Individual Partnership Action Plan in 2010 [268] Moldova also participates in NATO's peacekeeping force in Kosovo [269] Following the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia, NATO officials warned that Russia might seek to annex Transnistria, a breakaway Moldovan region [270] This separatist issue could preclude Moldova from joining NATO [268]\n\n\nSerbia\nYugoslavia's communist government sided with the Eastern Bloc at the beginning of the Cold War, but pursued a policy of neutrality following the Tito–Stalin split in 1948 [275] It was a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1961 Since that country's dissolution most of its successor states have joined NATO, but the largest of them, Serbia, has maintained Yugoslavia's policy of neutrality.\n\n\nOther proposals\nSome individuals have proposed expanding NATO outside of Europe, although doing so would require amending Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which specifically limits new membership to \"any other European State in a position to further the principles of this Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area.\" [292]\n\n\nSee

[22]\n\n\nEarly history\nIn early Indian history, diamonds were the most valued of gemstones However, during the period of Mughal rule, diamonds lost this distinction When looking at the Mughal treasury, Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, the Grand vizier to Akbar, noted that red spinels and Burmese rubies had become the most desirable jewels by the nobility [11] During this time the Persian new year ceremony, Nowruz, had become a period in which the subjects could bring offerings of gems and money to the imperial family in exchange for political promotions within the greater bureaucracy By the time Shah Jahan ascended the throne as the fifth Mughal emperor, there were so many jewels in the treasury that he decided to use many of them in the making of the ornate Peacock Throne in 1635 [11]\n\n\nIn Maharaja Ranjit Singh's possession\nRanjit Singh had the diamond examined by jewelers of Lahore for two days to ensure that Shuja had not tricked him After the jewelers confirmed its genuineness, he donated 125,000 rupees to Shuja Ranjit Singh then asked the principal jewelers of Amritsar to estimate the diamond's value; the jewelers declared that the value of the diamond was \"far beyond all computation\" [34] Ranjit Singh then affixed the diamond to the front of his turban, and paraded on an elephant to enable his subjects to see it [35] He used to wear it as an armlet during major festivals such as Diwali and Dusserah, and took it with him during travel He would exhibit it to prominent visitors, especially British officers [36]\n\n\nIn Gulab Singh's possession\nOn 8 October 1839, the new emperor Kharak Singh was overthrown in a coup by his prime minister Dhian Singh The prime minister's brother Gulab Singh, Raja of Jammu, came into possession of the Koh-i-Noor [43] Kharak Singh later died in prison, soon followed by the mysterious death of his son and successor Nau Nihal Singh on 5 November 1840 Gulab Singh held onto the stone until January 1841, when he presented it to emperor Sher Singh in order to win his favour, [44] after his brother Dhian Singh negotiated a ceasefire between Sher Singh and the overthrown empress Chand Kaur Gulab Singh had attempted to defend the widowed empress at her fort in Lahore, during two days of conflict and shelling by Sher Singh and his troops [45] Despite handing over the Koh-i-noor, Gulab Singh as a result of the ceasefire returned safely to Jammu with a wealth of gold and other jewels taken from the treasury [46]\n\n\nWorn by child emperor Duleep Singh\nOn 15 September 1843, both Sher Singh and prime minister Dhian Singh were assassinated in a coup led by Ajit Singh Sandhawalia However, the next day in a counter coup led by Dhian's son Hira Singh the assassins were killed Aged 24, Hira Singh succeeded his father as prime minister, and installed the five-year old Duleep Singh as emperor The Koh-i-noor was now fastened to the arm of the child emperor in court at Lahore Duleep Singh and his mother empress Jind Kaur, had till then resided in Jammu, the kingdom governed by Gulab Singh [11]\n\n\nSurrender to Queen Victoria\nOn 29 March 1849, following the conclusion of the Second Anglo-Sikh War, the Kingdom of Punjab was formally annexed to Company rule, and the Last Treaty of Lahore was signed, officially ceding the Koh-i-Noor to Queen Victoria and the Maharaja's other assets to the company Article III of the treaty read:\n\n\nJourney to the United Kingdom\nIn due course, the Governor-General received the Koh-i-Noor from Dr Login, who had been appointed Governor of the Citadel, on 6 April 1848 under a receipt dated 7 December 1849, in the presence of members of the Board of Administration for the affairs of the Punjab: Sir Henry Lawrence (President), C G Mansel, John Lawrence and Sir Henry Elliot (Secretary to the Government of India).\n\n\nThe Great Exhibition\nMembers of the public were given a chance to see the Koh-i-Noor when The Great Exhibition was staged at Hyde Park, London, in 1851 It represented the might of the British Empire and took pride of place in the eastern part of the central gallery [54]\n\n\n1852 re-cutting\nOriginally, the diamond had 169 facets and was 4.1 centimetres (1.6 in) long, 3.26 centimetres (1.28 in) wide, and 1.62 centimetres (0.64 in) deep It was high-domed, with a flat base and both triangular and rectangular facets, similar in overall appearance to other Mughal-era diamonds which are now in the Iranian Crown Jewels [57]\n\n\nCrown Jewel\nAfter Queen Victoria's death, the Koh-i-Noor was set in the Crown of Queen Alexandra, the wife of Edward VII, that was used to crown her at their coronation in 1902 The diamond was transferred to the Crown of Queen Mary in 1911, [64] and finally to Crown of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 1937 [65] When the Queen Mother died in 2002, the crown was placed on top of her coffin for the lying-in-state and funeral [66] Queen Camilla was crowned with Queen Mary's Crown at the Coronation of Charles III and Camilla on 6 May 2023, but without the Koh-i-Noor diamond [67] [68]\n\n\nOwnership dispute\nThe Koh-i-Noor has long been a subject of diplomatic controversy, with India, Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan all demanding its return from the UK at various points [73]\n\n\nIndia\nThe Government of India first demanded the return of the Koh-i-Noor as soon as independence was granted in 1947 A second request followed in 1953, the year of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II Each time, the British Government rejected the claims, saying that ownership was non-negotiable [60]\n\n\nPakistan\nIn 1976, Pakistan asserted its ownership of the diamond, saying its return would be \"a convincing demonstration of the spirit that moved Britain voluntarily to shed its imperial encumbrances and lead the process of decolonisation\" In a letter to the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the prime minister of the United Kingdom, James Callaghan, wrote, \"I need not remind you of the various hands through which the stone has passed over the past two centuries, nor that explicit provision for its transfer to the British crown was made in the peace treaty with the Maharajah of the Sikh Empire in 1849 I could not advise Her Majesty that it should be surrendered.\" [80]\n\n\nAfghanistan\nIn 2000, the Taliban's foreign affairs spokesman, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, said the Koh-i-Noor was the legitimate property of Afghanistan, and demanded for it to be handed over to the regime \"The history of the diamond shows it was taken from us (Afghanistan) to India, and from there to Britain We have a much better claim than the Indians\", he said [75] The Afghan claim derives from Shah Shuja Durrani's memoirs, which states he surrendered the diamond to Ranjit Singh while Singh was having his son tortured in front of him, so he argued that the Maharajah of Lahore acquired the stone illegitimately [81]\n\n\nProposed compromises\nBecause of the disputes over the diamond's rightful ownership, there have been various compromises suggested These include dividing it into four, with a piece given to each of Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan, with the final piece retained by the British Crown Another suggestion is that the jewel be housed in a special museum at the Wagah border between India and Pakistan However this suggestion does not cater to Afghan claims, nor the reality of current British possession [82] The British Government rejects these compromises, and has stated since the end of the British Raj that the status of the diamond is 'non-negotiable' [83]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nA rumor that the Koh-i-Noor is cursed may have originated with the Delhi Gazette; it was soon repeated in The Illustrated London News, and Queen Victoria herself expressed concern about the curse This led to a counter-rumor that the curse attached only to male rulers [58]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther

thousand years. The diamond has been the subject of diplomatic controversy, with India, Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan all demanding its return from the UK at various points. This article will explore the history of the Koh-i-Noor, its current status, and the various claims and controversies surrounding it.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Koh-i-Noor is a large, colorless diamond that weighs approximately 190 carats. It is one of the largest cut diamonds in the world and is considered one of the most valuable. The diamond has been owned by various empires and dynasties throughout history, including the Mughal Empire, the Sikh Empire, and the British Empire. Today, the Koh-i-Noor is part of the British Crown Jewels and is set in the Crown of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.\n\n**Legendary Origin**\n\nThe origins of the Koh-i-Noor are shrouded in legend and controversy. According to legend, the diamond was discovered in the kingdom of Golconda in southern India in the 13th century. However, this is disputed by many historians, who argue that the diamond may have originated in the kingdom of Kashi in ancient India. The diamond was said to have been owned by various empires and dynasties throughout history, including the Mughal Empire, the Delhi Sultanate, and the Kakatiya dynasty.\n\n**Early History**\n\nIn early Indian history, diamonds were the most valued of gemstones. However, during the period of Mughal rule, diamonds lost this distinction.

its ownership of the diamond, saying its return would be \"a convincing demonstration of the spirit that moved Britain voluntarily to shed its imperial encumbrances and lead the process of decolonisation\" In a letter to the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the prime minister of the United Kingdom, James Callaghan, wrote, \"I need not remind you of the various hands through which the stone has passed over the past two centuries, nor that explicit provision for its transfer to the British crown was made in the peace treaty with the Maharajah of the Sikh Empire in 1849 I could not advise Her Majesty that it should be surrendered.\" [80]\n\n\nAfghanistan\nIn 2000, the Taliban's foreign affairs spokesman, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, said the Koh-i-Noor was the legitimate property of Afghanistan, and demanded for it to be handed over to the regime \"The history of the diamond shows it was taken from us (Afghanistan) to India, and from there to Britain We have a much better claim than the Indians\", he said [75] The Afghan claim derives from Shah Shuja Durrani's memoirs, which states he surrendered the diamond to Ranjit Singh while Singh was having his son tortured in front of him, so he argued that the Maharajah of Lahore acquired the stone illegitimately [81]\n\n\nProposed compromises\nBecause of the disputes over the diamond's rightful ownership, there have been various compromises suggested These include dividing it into four, with a piece given to each of Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan, with the final piece retained by the British Crown Another suggestion is that the jewel be housed in a special museum at the Wagah border between India and Pakistan However this suggestion does not cater to Afghan claims, nor the reality of current British possession [82] The British Government rejects these compromises, and has stated since the end of the British Raj that the status of the diamond is 'non-negotiable' [83]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nA rumor that the Koh-i-Noor is cursed may have originated with the Delhi Gazette; it was soon repeated in The Illustrated London News, and Queen Victoria herself expressed concern about the curse This led to a counter-rumor that the curse attached only to male rulers [58]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal

Her groundbreaking achievements sparked a national debate on women's roles in the legal profession, paving the way for future generations of women to pursue careers in law.\n\n**Career**\n\nLidia Poët was born in 1855 in the hamlet of Traverse, Perrero, in the Occitan-speaking Germanasca Valley. This region was home to a community of Waldensians, a Protestant denomination known for their strong sense of independence and advocacy for women's rights. Poët's upbringing and family background instilled in her a strong sense of determination and a desire to challenge societal norms.\n\nPoët's academic achievements were marked by her exceptional intelligence and drive. She passed her law examinations at the Faculty of Law of the University of Turin and received her degree on 17 June 1881. This achievement was a significant milestone, as women were largely excluded from the legal profession at that time.\n\nAfter completing her studies, Poët \"attended forensic practice\" in the office of a lawyer for the following two years. During this period, she assisted at the sessions of the tribunals, gaining valuable experience and insight into the workings of the legal system.\n\nIn 1883, Poët underwent the theoretical and practical examination of the Order of Lawyers of Turin. Her outstanding performance earned her approval by 45 of 50 votes, and she was enrolled in the roll of lawyers (albo degli avvocati) on 9 August 1883. This historic moment marked the beginning of a new era for women in the legal profession in Italy.\n\n**Debate on women and the legal profession in Italy**\n\nPoët's enrollment in the roll of lawyers sparked a national debate on women's roles in the legal profession. The Italian press was divided, with 25 newspapers supporting women's public roles and only three opposing them. Those against Poët's entry into the legal profession made statements such as that the only men who supported women's public roles were unmarried celibates.\n\nThe debate was not limited to Italy. A teacher at the University of Padua named Taverni interviewed the U.S Minister to Italy, William Waldorf Astor, and reported that he said \"that the public opinion of the Americans was not in favor of the exercise of professions by women, inasmuch as the female physicians, lawyers, etc., practicing in America, do not belong either to the aristocracy of money or to that of intellect.\" However, Taverni himself favored public lives for women, as it would save the 250,000 \"unmarriageable\" Italian women who, unless society gave them a role, would spend their lives without an occupation.\n\n**Later life**\n\nFor the rest of her life, Poët remained active in the international women's movement. Her pioneering work in the legal profession paved the way for future generations of women to pursue careers in law. Her legacy extends beyond Italy, inspiring women around the world to challenge societal norms and pursue their dreams.\n\n**In popular culture**\n\nLidia Poët's life has been stylized in the Netflix TV series The Law According to Lidia Poët, played by Matilda De Angelis. This television series brings Poët's story to a wider audience, highlighting her bravery and determination in the face of societal opposition.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Women's rights movement in Italy\n* History of women in law\n* Italian feminism\n\n**References**\n\nThis article is based on various sources, including historical records and scholarly articles.

The season was played during the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the country's vaccination roll-outs commencing around the beginning of the season.\n\n**Impact of COVID-19 pandemic**\n\nThe season was played during a challenging time, with the country experiencing a second year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic had a significant impact on the season, with various state governments implementing different restrictions and lockdowns to control the spread of the virus. The country had largely settled into a paradigm of most states maintaining zero COVID-19 cases outside of their international travel quarantine systems; and when this was the case, it allowed matches to be played in front of crowds (albeit with reduced capacity) and unhindered interstate travel was permitted without quarantine.\n\nHowever, the different state governments often responded quickly to small numbers or even single virus cases being discovered in the community; this meant border restrictions or quarantine periods were often re-imposed at short notice, impacting interstate travel for matches; and, in some cases, that city- or state-wide lockdowns were imposed within the impacted states, precluding football activities altogether. Short 'snap lockdowns', lasting between three and seven days in a given city, became a common response to the first few cases in the community as governments adopted 'Zero-COVID' policies.\n\n**Rule changes**\n\nThe following rule changes were made in the 2021 season:\n\n* The 50-metre penalty for holding the ball was removed in 2021, with the intention of reducing stoppages in play and increasing free-flowing football.\n* The 18-metre mark was moved from the goal square to the 50-metre line, to encourage more territory-gaining and create more opportunities for attacking play.\n* The goal review system was modified to include a range of new criteria, including whether the ball was held or carried into the goal square.\n\n**Pre-season**\n\nThe pre-season series of games returned as the 2021 AAMI Community Series, with teams playing one game each. The games were stand-alone, with no overall winner of the series. All games were televised live on Fox Footy.\n\n**AAMI Community Series**\n\nThe 2021 AAMI Community Series was a series of pre-season games played by the 18 teams of the AFL. The series was played over a period of five weeks, with each team playing one game. The games were played in front of crowds, with some games having reduced capacity due to COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nThe AAMI Community Series provided an opportunity for teams to prepare for the upcoming season, and for fans to see their teams in action. The series was also an important fundraiser for the AFL, with proceeds going towards various charitable causes.\n\n**Home-and-away season**\n\nA full 23-round fixture for the 2021 season was released in December 2020; but dates, times and broadcasters were initially revealed only for the first six rounds, with the league intending to release the remaining dates in four-to-six weeks blocks with at least a month's notice during the season.\n\nThe home-and-away season ran from March to September, with each team playing 23 games.

and when this was the case, it allowed matches to be played in front of crowds (albeit with reduced capacity) and unhindered interstate travel was permitted without quarantine However, the different state governments often responded quickly to small numbers or even single virus cases being discovered in the community; this meant border restrictions or quarantine periods were often re-imposed at short notice, impacting interstate travel for matches; and, in some cases, that city- or state-wide lockdowns were imposed within the impacted states, precluding football activities altogether [1] Short 'snap lockdowns', lasting between three and seven days in a given city, became a common response to the first few cases in the community as governments adopted 'Zero-COVID' policies.\n\n\nRule changes\nThe following rule changes were made in the 2021 season: [8]\n\n\nPre-season\nThe pre-season series of games returned as the 2021 AAMI Community Series, with teams playing one game each The games were stand-alone, with no overall winner of the series All games were televised live on Fox Footy [14]\n\n\nAAMI Community Series\nThe pre-season series of games returned as the 2021 AAMI Community Series, with teams playing one game each The games were stand-alone, with no overall winner of the series All games were televised live on Fox Footy [14]\n\n\nHome-and-away season\nA full 23-round fixture for the 2021 season was released in December 2020;

{"title": "Armenian_genocide_denial", "content": "\nBackground\nThe presence of Armenians  in Anatolia is documented since the sixth century BC, almost two millennia before Turkish presence in the area [10] [11] The Ottoman Empire effectively treated Armenians and other non-Muslims as second-class citizens under Islamic rule, even after the nineteenth-century Tanzimat reforms intended to equalize their status [12] By the 1890s, Armenians faced forced conversions to Islam and increasing land seizures, which led a handful to join revolutionary parties such as the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF, also known as Dashnaktsutyun) [13] In the mid-1890s, state-sponsored Hamidian massacres killed at least 100,000 Armenians, and in 1909, the authorities failed to prevent the Adana massacre, which resulted in the death of some 17,000 Armenians [14] [15] [16] The Ottoman authorities denied any responsibility for these massacres, accusing Western powers of meddling and Armenians of provocation, while presenting Muslims as the main victims and failing to punish the perpetrators [17] [18] [19] These same tropes of denial would be employed later to deny the Armenian genocide [19] [20]\n\n\nArmenian genocide\nDuring the Ottoman invasion of Russian and Persian territory in late 1914, Ottoman paramilitaries massacred local Armenians [27] A few Ottoman Armenian soldiers defected to Russia—seized upon by both the CUP and later deniers as evidence of Armenian treachery—but the Armenian volunteers in the Russian army were mostly Russian Armenians [28] [29] [30] Massacres turned into genocide following the catastrophic Ottoman defeat by Russia in the Battle of Sarikamish (January 1915), which was blamed on Armenian treachery Armenian soldiers and officers were removed from their posts pursuant to a  25 February order issued by Minister of War Enver Pasha [27] [31] In the minds of the Ottoman leaders, isolated incidents of Armenian resistance were taken as evidence of a general insurrection [32]\n\n\nOrigins\nGenocide denial is the minimization of an event established as genocide, either by denying the facts or by denying the intent of the perpetrators [50]  Denial was present from the outset as an integral part of the Armenian genocide, which was perpetrated under the guise of resettlement [51] [52] Denial emerged because of the Ottoman desire to maintain American neutrality in the war and German financial and military support [53]\n\n\nOttoman Empire\nGenocide denial is the minimization of an event established as genocide, either by denying the facts or by denying the intent of the perpetrators [50]  Denial was present from the outset as an integral part of the Armenian genocide, which was perpetrated under the guise of resettlement [51] [52] Denial emerged because of the Ottoman desire to maintain American neutrality in the war and German financial and military support [53]\n\n\nTurkish nationalist movement\nThe Armenian genocide itself played a key role in the destruction of the Ottoman Empire and the foundation of the Turkish republic [5] The destruction of the Christian middle class, and redistribution of their properties, enabled the creation of a new Muslim/Turkish bourgeoisie [60] [61] [62] There was significant continuity between the Ottoman Empire and Republic of Turkey, and the Republican People's Party was the successor of the Committee of Union and Progress that carried out the genocide [63] [64] The Turkish nationalist movement depended on support from those who had perpetrated the genocide or enriched themselves from it, creating an incentive for silence [65] [66]  Denial and minimization of wartime atrocities was crucial to the formation of a Turkish nationalist consensus [67]\n\n\nIn Turkey\nHistorian Erik-Jan Zürcher argues that, since the Turkish nationalist movement depended on the support of a broad coalition of actors that benefitted from the genocide, it was impossible to break with the past [65] From the founding of the republic, the genocide has been viewed as a necessity and raison d'état [84] [85] Many of the main perpetrators, including Talat Pasha, were hailed as national heroes of Turkey; many schools, streets, and mosques are still named after them [86] Those convicted and sentenced to death by the postwar tribunal for crimes against Armenians, such as Mehmet Kemal and Behramzade Nusret, were proclaimed national and glorious martyrs and their families were rewarded by the state with confiscated Armenian properties [77] [87] Turkish historian Taner Akçam states that, \"It's not easy for a nation to call its founding fathers murderers and thieves.\" [88] Kieser and other historians argue that \"the single most important reason for this inability to accept culpability is the centrality of the Armenian massacres for the formation of the Turkish nation-state.\" [5] Turkish historian Doğan Gürpınar says that acknowledging the genocide would bring into question the foundational assumptions of the Turkish nation-state [89]\n\n\nCauses\nHistorian Erik-Jan Zürcher argues that, since the Turkish nationalist

the formation of the Turkish nation-state.\" [5] Turkish historian Doğan Gürpınar says that acknowledging the genocide would bring into question the foundational assumptions of the Turkish nation-state [89]\n\n\nDestruction and concealment of evidence\nAn edict of the Ottoman government banned foreigners from taking photographs of Armenian refugees or the corpses that accumulated on the sides of the roads on which death marches were carried out Violators were threatened with arrest [98] Strictly enforced censorship laws prevented Armenian survivors from publishing memoirs, prohibiting \"any publication at odds with the general policies of the state\" [99] [100] Those who acknowledge the genocide have been prosecuted under laws against \"insulting Turkishness\" [93] Talat Pasha had decreed that \"everything must be done to abolish even the word 'Armenia' in Turkey\" [101] In the postwar Turkish republic, Armenian cultural heritage has been subject to systematic destruction in an attempt to eradicate the Armenian presence [102] [101] On 5 January 1916, Enver Pasha ordered all place names of Greek, Armenian, or Bulgarian origin to be changed, a policy fully implemented in the later republic, continuing into the 1980s [103] Mass graves of genocide victims have also been destroyed, although many still exist [104] After the 1918 armistice, incriminating documents in the Ottoman archives were systematically destroyed [105] The records of the postwar courts-martial in Constantinople have also disappeared [106] [107] Recognizing that some archival documents supported its position, the Turkish government announced that the archives relevant to the \"Armenian question\" would be opened in 1985 [108] According to Turkish historian Halil Berktay, diplomat Nuri Birgi  [tr] conducted a second purge of the archives at this time [109] The archives were officially opened in 1989, [108] but in practice, some archives remained sealed, and access to other archives was restricted to scholars sympathetic to the official Turkish narrative [110] [111]\n\n\nTurkish historiography\nIn Mustafa Kemal's 1927 Nutuk speech, which was the foundation of Kemalist historiography, the tactics of silence and denial are employed to deal with violence against Armenians As in his other speeches, he presents Turks as innocent of any wrongdoing and as victims of horrific Armenian atrocities [112] [113] [114] For decades, Turkish historiography ignored the Armenian genocide One of the early exceptions was the genocide perpetrator Esat Uras, who published The Armenians in History and the Armenian Question in 1950 Uras's book, probably written in response to post–World War II Soviet territorial claims, was a novel synthesis of earlier arguments deployed by the CUP during the war, and linked wartime denial with the \"official narrative\" on the genocide developed in the 1980s [115] [116]\n\n\nEducation\nTurkish schools, public or private, are required to use history textbooks approved by the Ministry of Education [135] [136] [138] The state uses this monopoly to increase support for the official denialist position, [136] [139] vilifying Armenians and presenting them as enemies [140] [141] For decades, these textbooks did not mention Armenians as part of Ottoman history [142] [143] [144] Since the 1980s, textbooks discuss the \"events of 1915\", but deflect the blame from the Ottoman government to other actors They accuse imperialist powers of manipulating the Armenians to undermine the empire, and allege that the Armenians committed treason or presented a threat Some textbooks admit that deportations occurred and Armenians died, but present this action as necessary and justified Since 2005, textbooks have accused Armenians of perpetrating genocide against Turkish Muslims [143] [145] [146] In 2003, students in each grade level were instructed to write essays refuting the genocide [147]\n\n\nSociety\nFor decades, the genocide was a taboo subject in Turkish society [148] Göçek states that it is the interaction between state and society that makes denial so persistent [149] Besides the Turkish state, Turkish intellectuals and civil society have also denied the genocide [150] Turkish fiction dealing with the genocide typically denies it, while claiming the fictional narrative is based on true events [151] Noting many people in eastern Turkey have passed down memories of the event, genocide scholar Uğur Ümit Üngör says that \"the Turkish government is denying a genocide that its own population remembers.\" [152] The Turkish state and most of society have engaged in similar silencing regarding other ethnic persecutions and human rights violations in the Ottoman Empire and Republican Turkey against Greeks, Assyrians, Kurds, Jews and Alevis [55] [153] [154]\n\n\nPolitics\nThe Islamic conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to power in 2002 [164] [165] and took an approach to history that was critical of both the CUP and the early Republican era This position initially led to some liberalization and a wider range of views that could be expressed in the public sphere The AKP presented its approach to the \"events of 1915\" as an alternative to genocide denial and genocide recognition, by emphasizing shared suffering [166] [167] Over time, and especially since the 2016 failed coup, the AKP government became increasingly authoritarian; political repression and censorship has made it more difficult to discuss controversial topics such as the Armenian genocide [168]  As of 2020 [update], all major political parties in Turkey, except the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), as well as many pro- and anti-government media and civil society organizations, support denial Both government and opposition parties have strongly opposed genocide recognition in other countries [169] No Turkish government has admitted what happened to the Armenians was a crime, let alone a genocide [170] [171] [172] On 24 April 2019, president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan tweeted, \"The relocation of the Armenian gangs and their supporters .. was the most reasonable action that could be taken in such a period\" [173]\n\n\nForeign relations of Turkey\nTurkish efforts to project its genocide denial overseas date to the 1920s, [174] [175] or, alternately, to the genocide itself [176] [177] Turkey's century-long effort to deny the Armenian genocide sets this genocide apart from others in history According to genocide scholar Roger W Smith, \"In no other instance has a government gone to such extreme lengths to deny that a massive genocide took place.\" [6]  Central to Turkey's ability to deny the genocide and counter its recognition is the country's strategic position in the Middle East, Cold War alliance with the West, and membership of NATO [178] [179] Historians have described the role of other countries in enabling Turkey's genocide denial as a form of collusion [180] [181] [182]\n\n\nGermany\nFrom 1915 to 1918, Germany and the Ottoman Empire undertook \"joint propaganda efforts of denial.\" [193] German newspapers repeated the Ottoman government's denial of committing atrocities and stories of alleged Armenian treachery [194] [195] The government censorship handbook mandated strict limits on speech about Armenians, although penalties for violations were light [196] On 11 January 1916, socialist deputy Karl Liebknecht raised the issue of the Armenian genocide in the Reichstag, receiving the reply that the Ottoman government \"has been forced, due to the seditious machinations of our enemies, to transfer the Armenian population of certain areas, and to assign them new places of residence.\" Laughter interrupted Liebknecht's follow-up questions [197] [198] During the 1921 trial of Soghomon Tehlirian for the assassination of Talat Pasha, so much evidence was revealed that denial became untenable German nationalists instead portrayed what they acknowledged as the intentional extermination of the Armenian people as justified [199]\n\n\nUnited States\nHistorian Donald Bloxham states that, \"In a very real sense, 'genocide denial' was accepted and furthered by the United States government before the term genocide had even been coined.\" [204] [205] In interwar Turkey, prominent American diplomats like Mark L Bristol and Joseph Grew endorsed the Turkish nationalist view that the Armenian genocide was a war against the forces of imperialism [205] [206] In 1922, before receiving the Chester concession, Colby Chester argued that Christians of Anatolia were not massacred; his writing exhibited many of the themes of later genocide denial [207] [208] In the 1930s, the Turkish embassy scuttled a planned film adaptation of Franz Werfel's popular novel The Forty Days of Musa Dagh by the American company MGM, threatening a boycott of American films Turkish embassies, with the support of the US State Department, shot down attempts to revive the film in the 1950s and 1960s [204] [209]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nHuman rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson charged that around 2000, \"genocide denial had entrenched itself in the Eastern Department  [of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)] .. to such an extent that it was briefing ministers with a bare-faced disregard for readily ascertainable facts\", such as its own records from the time [217] In 2006, in response to a debate initiated by MP Steven Pound, a representative of the FCO said the United Kingdom did not recognize the genocide because \"the evidence is not sufficiently unequivocal\" [218]\n\n\nIsrael\nAccording to historians Rıfat Bali  [de; tr] and Marc David Baer, Armenian genocide denial was the most important factor in the normalization of Israel–Turkey relations [219] The 1982 International Conference on the Holocaust and Genocide, which took place in Tel Aviv, included six presentations on the Armenian genocide Turkey threatened that if the conference was held, it would close its borders to Jewish refugees from Iran and Syria, putting their lives in danger As a result, the Israeli Foreign Ministry joined the ultimately unsuccessful effort to cancel the conference [220]\n\n\nDenialism in academia\nUntil the twenty-first century, Ottoman and Turkish studies marginalized the killings of Armenians, which many academics portrayed as a wartime measure justified by emergency and avoided discussing in depth These fields have long enjoyed close institutional links with the Turkish state Statements by these academics were cited to further the Turkish denial agenda [225] Historians who recognized the genocide feared professional retaliation for expressing their views [226] [227] The methodology of denial has been compared to the tactics of the tobacco industry or global warming denial: funding of biased research, creating a smokescreen of doubt, and thereby manufacturing a controversy [228] [229] [230] where there is no genuine academic dispute [231]\n\n\nAcademic integrity controversies\nMany scholars consider it unethical for academics to deny the Armenian genocide [227] [246]  Beyond that, there have been several controversies about academic integrity relating to denial of the genocide In 1990, psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton received a letter from Nüzhet Kandemir, Turkish ambassador to the United States, questioning references to the Armenian genocide in one of Lifton's books The ambassador inadvertently included a draft of a letter from Lowry advising the ambassador on how to prevent mention of the Armenian genocide in scholarly works Lowry was later named Atatürk Professor of Ottoman Studies at Princeton University, which the Turkish government had endowed with a $750,000 grant His actions were described as \"subversion of scholarship\"; [247] he later said it was a mistake to have written the letter [248]\n\n\nExamination of claims\nThe official Turkish view is based on the belief that the Armenian genocide was a legitimate state action and therefore cannot be challenged on legal or moral grounds [257]  Publications from this point of view share many of the basic facts with non-denialist histories, but differ in their interpretation and emphases [258] In line with the CUP's justification of its actions, denialist works portray Armenians as an existential threat to the empire in a time of war, while rejecting the CUP's intent to exterminate the Armenian people Historian Ronald Grigor Suny summarizes the main denialist argument as, \"There was no genocide, and the Armenians were to blame for it.\" [4] [259]\n\n\nLegality\nAccording to former International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) judge Flavia Lattanzi, the present Turkish government's \"denial of past Ottoman and Turkish authorities' wrongdoings is a new violation of international law\" [295]\n\n\nConsequences\nKieser, Göçek, and Cheterian state that ongoing denial prevents Turkey from achieving a full democracy including pluralism and human rights, and that this denial fosters state repression of minority groups in Turkey, especially Kurds [313] Akçam says that genocide denial \"rationaliz [es] the violent persecution of religious and ethnic minorities\" and desensitizes the population to future episodes of mass violence [314] Until the Turkish state acknowledges genocide, he argues, \"there is a potential there, always, that it can do it again\" [315] Vicken Cheterian says that genocide denial \"pollutes the political culture of entire societies, where violence and threats become part of a political exercise degrading basic rights and democratic practice\" [316]  When recognizing the Armenian genocide in April 2015, Pope Francis added, \"concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding without bandaging it\" [317]\n\n\nInternational relations\nTurkey closed its border with Armenia in 1993, following the First Nagorno-Karabakh War between Armenia and Turkic-speaking Azerbaijan The closed border harms the economies of Armenia and eastern Turkey [191] [325] Although Armenia was willing to normalize relations without preconditions, Turkey demanded that the Armenian side abandon all support for the recognition efforts of the Armenian diaspora [326] There have been two major attempts at Turkish-Armenian reconciliation—the Turkish Armenian Reconciliation Commission (2000–2004) and the Zurich Protocols (2009)—both of which failed partly because of the controversy over the Armenian genocide In both cases, the mediators did their best to sideline historical disputes, which proved impossible [327] Armenian diaspora groups opposed both initiatives and especially a historical commission to investigate what they considered established facts [328] Bloxham asserts that since \"denial has always been accompanied by rhetoric of Armenian treachery, aggression, criminality, and territorial ambition, it actually enunciates an ongoing if latent threat of Turkish 'revenge'.\" [329]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nCitations\n\n\n\nSources\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nChapters\n\n\n\nJournal

outline:\n\n\nBackground\nThe presence of Armenians  in Anatolia is documented since the sixth century BC, almost two millennia before Turkish presence in the area [10] [11] The Ottoman Empire effectively treated Armenians and other non-Muslims as second-class citizens under Islamic rule, even after the nineteenth-century Tanzimat reforms intended to equalize their status [12] By the 1890s, Armenians faced forced conversions to Islam and increasing land seizures, which led a handful to join revolutionary parties such as the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF, also known as Dashnaktsutyun) [13] In the mid-1890s, state-sponsored Hamidian massacres killed at least 100,000 Armenians, and in 1909, the authorities failed to prevent the Adana massacre, which resulted in the death of some 17,000 Armenians [14] [15] [16] The Ottoman authorities denied any responsibility for these massacres, accusing Western powers of meddling and Armenians of provocation, while presenting Muslims as the main victims and failing to punish the perpetrators [17] [18] [19] These same tropes of denial would be employed later to deny the Armenian genocide [19] [20]\n\n\nArmenian genocide\nDuring the Ottoman invasion of Russian and Persian territory in late 1914, Ottoman paramilitaries massacred local Armenians [27] A few Ottoman Armenian soldiers defected to Russia—seized upon by both the CUP and later deniers as evidence of Armenian treachery—but the Armenian volunteers in the Russian army were mostly Russian Armenians [28] [29] [30] Massacres turned into genocide following the catastrophic Ottoman defeat by Russia in the Battle of Sarikamish (January 1915), which was blamed on Armenian treachery Armenian soldiers and officers were removed from their posts pursuant to a  25 February order issued by Minister of War Enver Pasha [27] [31] In the minds of the Ottoman leaders, isolated incidents of Armenian resistance were taken as evidence of a general insurrection [32]\n\n\nOrigins\nGenocide denial is the minimization of an event established as genocide, either by denying the facts or by denying the intent of the perpetrators [50]  Denial was present from the outset as an integral part of the Armenian genocide, which was perpetrated under the guise of resettlement [51] [52] Denial emerged because of the Ottoman desire to maintain American neutrality in the war and German financial and military support [53]\n\n\nOttoman Empire\nGenocide denial is the minimization of an event established as genocide, either by denying the facts or by denying the intent of the perpetrators [50]  Denial was present from the outset as an integral part of the Armenian genocide, which was perpetrated under the guise of resettlement [51] [52] Denial emerged because of the Ottoman desire to maintain American neutrality in the war and German financial and military support [53]\n\n\nTurkish nationalist movement\nThe Armenian genocide itself played a key role in the destruction of the Ottoman Empire and the foundation of the Turkish republic [5] The destruction of the Christian middle class, and redistribution of their properties, enabled the creation of a new Muslim/Turkish bourgeoisie [60] [61] [62] There was significant continuity between the Ottoman Empire and Republic of Turkey, and the Republican People's Party was the successor of the Committee of Union and Progress that carried out the genocide [63] [64] The Turkish nationalist movement depended on support from those who had perpetrated the genocide or enriched themselves from it, creating an incentive for silence [65] [66]  Denial and minimization of wartime atrocities was crucial to the formation of a Turkish nationalist consensus [67]\n\n\nIn Turkey\nHistorian Erik-Jan Zürcher argues that, since the Turkish nationalist movement depended on the support of a broad coalition of actors that benefitted from the genocide, it was impossible to break with the past [65] From the founding of the republic, the genocide has been viewed as a necessity and raison d'état [84] [85] Many of the main perpetrators, including Talat Pasha, were hailed as national heroes of Turkey; many schools, streets, and mosques are still named after them [86] Those convicted and sentenced to death by the postwar tribunal for crimes against Armenians, such as Mehmet Kemal and Behramzade Nusret, were proclaimed national and glorious martyrs and their families were rewarded by the state with confiscated Armenian properties [77] [87] Turkish historian Taner Akçam states that, \"It's not easy for a nation to call its founding fathers murderers and thieves.\" [88] Kieser and other historians argue that \"the single most important reason for this inability to accept culpability is the centrality of the Armenian massacres for the formation of the Turkish nation-state.\" [5] Turkish historian Doğan Gürpınar says that acknowledging the genocide would bring into question the foundational assumptions of the Turkish nation-state [89]\n\n\nCauses\nHistorian Erik-Jan Zürcher argues that, since the Turkish nationalist movement depended on the support of a broad coalition of

historian Doğan Gürpınar says that acknowledging the genocide would bring into question the foundational assumptions of the Turkish nation-state [89]\n\n\nDestruction and concealment of evidence\nAn edict of the Ottoman government banned foreigners from taking photographs of Armenian refugees or the corpses that accumulated on the sides of the roads on which death marches were carried out Violators were threatened with arrest [98] Strictly enforced censorship laws prevented Armenian survivors from publishing memoirs, prohibiting \"any publication at odds with the general policies of the state\" [99] [100] Those who acknowledge the genocide have been prosecuted under laws against \"insulting Turkishness\" [93] Talat Pasha had decreed that \"everything must be done to abolish even the word 'Armenia' in Turkey\" [101] In the postwar Turkish republic, Armenian cultural heritage has been subject to systematic destruction in an attempt to eradicate the Armenian presence [102] [101] On 5 January 1916, Enver Pasha ordered all place names of Greek, Armenian, or Bulgarian origin to be changed, a policy fully implemented in the later republic, continuing into the 1980s [103] Mass graves of genocide victims have also been destroyed, although many still exist [104] After the 1918 armistice, incriminating documents in the Ottoman archives were systematically destroyed [105] The records of the postwar courts-martial in Constantinople have also disappeared [106] [107] Recognizing that some archival documents supported its position, the Turkish government announced that the archives relevant to the \"Armenian question\" would be opened in 1985 [108] According to Turkish historian Halil Berktay, diplomat Nuri Birgi  [tr] conducted a second purge of the archives at this time [109] The archives were officially opened in 1989, [108] but in practice, some archives remained sealed, and access to other archives was restricted to scholars sympathetic to the official Turkish narrative [110] [111]\n\n\nTurkish historiography\nIn Mustafa Kemal's 1927 Nutuk speech, which was the foundation of Kemalist historiography, the tactics of silence and denial are employed to deal with violence against Armenians As in his other speeches, he presents Turks as innocent of any wrongdoing and as victims of horrific Armenian atrocities [112] [113] [114] For decades, Turkish historiography ignored the Armenian genocide One of the early exceptions was the genocide perpetrator Esat Uras, who published The Armenians in History and the Armenian Question in 1950 Uras's book, probably written in response to post–World War II Soviet territorial claims, was a novel synthesis of earlier arguments deployed by the CUP during the war, and linked wartime denial with the \"official narrative\" on the genocide developed in the 1980s [115] [116]\n\n\nEducation\nTurkish schools, public or private, are required to use history textbooks approved by the Ministry of Education [135] [136] [138] The state uses this monopoly to increase support for the official denialist position, [136] [139] vilifying Armenians and presenting them as enemies [140] [141] For decades, these textbooks did not mention Armenians as part of Ottoman history [142] [143] [144] Since the 1980s, textbooks discuss the \"events of 1915\", but deflect the blame from the Ottoman government to other actors They accuse imperialist powers of manipulating the Armenians to undermine the empire, and allege that the Armenians committed treason or presented a threat Some textbooks admit that deportations occurred and Armenians died, but present this action as necessary and justified Since 2005, textbooks have accused Armenians of perpetrating genocide against Turkish Muslims [143] [145] [146] In 2003, students in each grade level were instructed to write essays refuting the genocide [147]\n\n\nSociety\nFor decades, the genocide was a taboo subject in Turkish society [148] Göçek states that it is the interaction between state and society that makes denial so persistent [149] Besides the Turkish state, Turkish intellectuals and civil society have also denied the genocide [150] Turkish fiction dealing with the genocide typically denies it, while claiming the fictional narrative is based on true events [151] Noting many people in eastern Turkey have passed down memories of the event, genocide scholar Uğur Ümit Üngör says that \"the Turkish government is denying a genocide that its own population remembers.\" [152] The Turkish state and most of society have engaged in similar silencing regarding other ethnic persecutions and human rights violations in the Ottoman Empire and Republican Turkey against Greeks, Assyrians, Kurds, Jews and Alevis [55] [153] [154]\n\n\nPolitics\nThe Islamic conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to power in 2002 [164] [165] and took an approach to history that was critical of both the CUP and the early Republican era This position initially led to some liberalization and a wider range of views that could be expressed in the public sphere The AKP presented its approach to the \"events of 1915\" as an alternative to genocide denial and genocide recognition, by emphasizing shared suffering [166] [167] Over time, and especially since the 2016 failed coup, the AKP government became increasingly authoritarian; political repression and censorship has made it more difficult to discuss controversial topics such as the Armenian genocide [168]  As of 2020 [update], all major political parties in Turkey, except the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), as well as many pro- and anti-government media and civil society organizations, support denial Both government and opposition parties have strongly opposed genocide recognition in other countries [169] No Turkish government has admitted what happened to the Armenians was a crime, let alone a genocide [170] [171] [172] On 24 April 2019, president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan tweeted, \"The relocation of the Armenian gangs and their supporters .. was the most reasonable action that could be taken in such a period\" [173]\n\n\nForeign relations of Turkey\nTurkish efforts to project its genocide denial overseas date to the 1920s, [174] [175] or, alternately, to the genocide itself [176] [177] Turkey's century-long effort to deny the Armenian genocide sets this genocide apart from others in history According to genocide scholar Roger W Smith, \"In no other instance has a government gone to such extreme lengths to deny that a massive genocide took place.\" [6]  Central to Turkey's ability to deny the genocide and counter its recognition is the country's strategic position in the Middle East, Cold War alliance with the West, and membership of NATO [178] [179] Historians have described the role of other countries in enabling Turkey's genocide denial as a form of collusion [180] [181] [182]\n\n\nGermany\nFrom 1915 to 1918, Germany and the Ottoman Empire undertook \"joint propaganda efforts of denial.\" [193] German newspapers repeated the Ottoman government's denial of committing atrocities and stories of alleged Armenian treachery [194] [195] The government censorship handbook mandated strict limits on speech about Armenians, although penalties for violations were light [196] On 11 January 1916, socialist deputy Karl Liebknecht raised the issue of the Armenian genocide in the Reichstag, receiving the reply that the Ottoman government \"has been forced, due to the seditious machinations of our enemies, to transfer the Armenian population of certain areas, and to assign them new places of residence.\" Laughter interrupted Liebknecht's follow-up questions [197] [198] During the 1921 trial of Soghomon Tehlirian for the assassination of Talat Pasha, so much evidence was revealed that denial became untenable German nationalists instead portrayed what they acknowledged as the intentional extermination of the Armenian people as justified [199]\n\n\nUnited States\nHistorian Donald Bloxham states that, \"In a very real sense, 'genocide denial' was accepted and furthered by the United States government

Dagh by the American company MGM, threatening a boycott of American films Turkish embassies, with the support of the US State Department, shot down attempts to revive the film in the 1950s and 1960s [204] [209]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nHuman rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson charged that around 2000, \"genocide denial had entrenched itself in the Eastern Department  [of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)] .. to such an extent that it was briefing ministers with a bare-faced disregard for readily ascertainable facts\", such as its own records from the time [217] In 2006, in response to a debate initiated by MP Steven Pound, a representative of the FCO said the United Kingdom did not recognize the genocide because \"the evidence is not sufficiently unequivocal\" [218]\n\n\nIsrael\nAccording to historians Rıfat Bali  [de; tr] and Marc David Baer, Armenian genocide denial was the most important factor in the normalization of Israel–Turkey relations [219] The 1982 International Conference on the Holocaust and Genocide, which took place in Tel Aviv, included six presentations on the Armenian genocide Turkey threatened that if the conference was held, it would close its borders to Jewish refugees from Iran and Syria, putting their lives in danger As a result, the Israeli Foreign Ministry joined the ultimately unsuccessful effort to cancel the conference [220]\n\n\nDenialism in academia\nUntil the twenty-first century, Ottoman and Turkish studies marginalized the killings of Armenians, which many academics portrayed as a wartime measure justified by emergency and avoided discussing in depth These fields have long enjoyed close institutional links with the Turkish state Statements by these academics were cited to further the Turkish

non-denialist histories, but differ in their interpretation and emphases [258] In line with the CUP's justification of its actions, denialist works portray Armenians as an existential threat to the empire in a time of war, while rejecting the CUP's intent to exterminate the Armenian people Historian Ronald Grigor Suny summarizes the main denialist argument as, \"There was no genocide, and the Armenians were to blame for it.\" [4] [259]\n\n\nLegality\nAccording to former International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) judge Flavia Lattanzi, the present Turkish government's \"denial of past Ottoman and Turkish authorities' wrongdoings is a new violation of international law\" [295]\n\n\nConsequences\nKieser, Göçek, and Cheterian state that ongoing denial prevents Turkey

Joseph Bishara and was released on June 3, 2016, by WaterTower Music [36] [37] Bishara, a recurring collaborator of director James Wan, composed the score after having previously written the music for

Peter Jackson's masterful direction and the abundant archival footage make this a must-see for Beatles fans and music enthusiasts alike.\n\n**Production**\n\nWhile visiting Apple Corps to discuss working on a potential Beatles exhibition featuring augmented or virtual reality, Peter Jackson asked Apple about the archival footage for the 1970 documentary of the album, which he was allowed access to for a potential new documentary. Jackson was hesitant to sign onto the project because of his fears about the long-reported acrimony surrounding the Beatles breakup. Upon viewing the footage, he later stated, he \"was relieved to discover the reality is very different to the myth .. Sure, there's moments of drama – but none of the discord this project has long been associated with.\" Sixty hours of film footage, shot in January 1969, and over 150 hours of audio stemming from the original Let It Be film were made available to Jackson's team.\n\n**Episodes**\n\nThe final cut covers 21 days in the studio with the Beatles as they rehearse for a forthcoming album, concert, and film project, and climaxes with the full 42-minute rooftop concert. Jackson described the series as \"a documentary about a documentary,\" as well as a \"tougher\" one than Let It Be, since it includes controversial events such as Harrison's brief resignation from the band, which the original film had not covered. With the exception of specific shots where no alternative exists, most of the material that had been featured in Let It Be was not reused in Get Back, and the series primarily used footage captured from alternative camera angles in the case of sequences shared between the two works.\n\n**Content**\n\nThe final cut covers 21 days in the studio with the Beatles as they rehearse for a forthcoming album, concert, and film project, and climaxes with the full 42-minute rooftop concert.

{"title": "Mohamed_Atta", "content": "\nAliases\nMohamed Atta had varied his name on documents, also using \"Mehan Atta\", \"Mohammad El Amir\", \"Muhammad Atta\", \"Mohamed El Sayed\", \"Mohamed Elsayed\", \"Muhammad al-Amir\", \"Awag Al Sayyid Atta\", and \"Awad Al Sayad\" [1] In Germany, he registered his name as \"Mohamed el-Amir Awad el-Sayed Atta\", and went by the name Mohamed el-Amir at the Hamburg University of Technology [2] In his will, written in 1996, Atta gives his name as \"Mohamed the son of Mohamed Elamir awad Elsayed\" [3] He was known as Abd al-Rahman al-Misri by al-Qaeda Atta also claimed different nationalities, sometimes Egyptian and other times telling people he was from the United Arab Emirates [2]\n\n\nEarly life\nMohamed Atta was born on 1 September 1968, in Kafr el-Sheikh, located in the Nile Delta region of Egypt (then a part of the United Arab Republic) [4] His father, Mohamed el-Amir Awad el-Sayed Atta, was a lawyer, educated in both civil law and sharia His mother, Buthayna Mohamed Mustafa Shiraqi, came from a wealthy farming and trading family and was also educated Buthayna and Mohamed married when she was 14, via an arranged marriage The family had few relatives on the father's side and kept their distance from Buthayna's family In-laws characterized Atta's father as \"austere, strict, and private\", and neighbors viewed the family as reclusive [5] Atta was the only son; he had two older sisters who are both well-educated and successful in their careers – one as a medical doctor and the other as a professor [6]\n\n\nGermany\nAtta graduated from Cairo University with marks insufficient for the graduate program As his father insisted that he go abroad for graduate studies, Atta, to this end, entered a German-language program at the Goethe-Institut in Cairo [13] In 1992, his father overheard a German couple who were visiting Egypt's capital The couple explained at dinner that they ran an exchange program and invited Atta to continue his studies in Germany; they also offered him room and board at their home in the city Atta accepted and arrived in Germany two weeks later, in July.\n\n\nAcademic studies\nAt the Hamburg University of Technology, Atta studied under the guidance of the department chair, Dittmar Machule, who specialized in the Middle East [18] Atta was averse to modern development This included the construction of high-rise buildings in Cairo and other ancient cities in the region He believed that the drab and impersonal apartment blocks, built in the 60s and 70s, ruined the beauty of old neighborhoods and robbed their people of privacy and dignity Atta's family moved into an apartment block in 1990; it was to him but \"a shabby symbol of Egypt's haphazard attempts to modernize and its shameless embrace of the West.\" [9] For his thesis, Atta concentrated on the ancient Syrian city of Aleppo He researched the history of the urban landscape in relation to the general theme of conflict between Arab and modern civilization He criticized how the newfangled skyscrapers and other modernizing projects disrupted the fabric of communities by blocking common streets and altering the skyline.\n\n\nReligious zeal and Hamburg cell\nAfter coming to Hamburg in 1992, Atta grew more religiously fanatical and frequented the mosque with greater regularity [28] His friends in Germany described him as an intelligent man in whom religious convictions and political motives held equal sway He harbored anger and resentment toward the U.S for its policy in Islamic nations of the Middle East, with nothing inflaming his ire more than the Oslo Accords and the Gulf War in particular [29] [30] He was also angry and bitter at the elite in his native Egypt, who he believed hoarded power for themselves, as well as at the Egyptian government, that cracked down on the dissident Muslim Brotherhood [31] Atta was anti-Semitic, believing that Jews controlled the world's media, financial, and political institutions from New York City [32] These beliefs were even stronger during Operation Infinite Reach, as he believed that Monica Lewinsky was a Jewish agent influencing American president Bill Clinton against aiding Palestine, which would later play a key role in creating the Hamburg cell [33]\n\n\nUnited States\nOn 22 March 2000, Atta was still in Germany when he sent an e-mail to the Academy of Lakeland in Florida He inquired about flight training, \"Dear sir, we are a small group of young men from different Arab countries Now, we are living in Germany since a while for study purposes We would like to start training for the career of airline professional pilots In this field, we haven't yet any knowledge but we are ready to undergo an intensive training program (up to ATP and eventually higher).\" Atta sent 50–60 similar e-mails to other flight training schools in the United States [55]\n\n\nJuly 2001 summit in Spain\nIn July 2001, Atta again left for Spain in order to meet with bin al-Shibh for the last time On 7 July 2001, Atta flew on Swissair Flight 117 from Miami to Zürich, where he had a stopover [70] On 8 July, Atta was recorded on surveillance video when he withdrew 1700 Swiss francs from an ATM He used his credit card to purchase two Swiss Army knives and some chocolate in a shop at the Zurich Airport [71] After the stopover in Zürich, he arrived in Madrid at 4:45 pm on Swissair Flight 656, and spent several hours at the airport Then at 8:50 pm, he checked into the Hotel Diana Cazadora in Barajas, a town near the airport That night and twice the next morning, he called Bashar Ahmad Ali Musleh, a Jordanian student in Hamburg who served as a liaison for bin al-Shibh [72]\n\n\nFinal plans in the U.S.\nOn 22 July 2001, Atta rented a Mitsubishi Galant from Alamo Rent a Car, putting 3,836 miles (6,173 km) on the vehicle before returning it on 26 July On 25 July, Atta dropped Ziad Jarrah off at Miami International Airport for a flight back to Germany On 26 July, Atta traveled via Continental Airlines to Newark, New Jersey, checked into the Kings Inn Hotel in Wayne, New Jersey, and stayed there until 30 July when he took a flight from Newark back to Fort Lauderdale [10]\n\n\n9/11 attacks and death\nOn 10 September 2001, Atta picked up al-Omari from the Milner Hotel in Boston, Massachusetts, and the two drove their rented Nissan Altima to a Comfort Inn in South Portland, Maine On the way, they were seen getting gasoline at an Exxon gas station and visited the Longfellow House in Portland that afternoon; [82] they arrived at the hotel at 5:43 p.m and spent the night in Room 233 While in South Portland, they were seen making two ATM withdrawals and stopping at Wal-Mart The FBI also reported that two Middle-Eastern men were seen in the parking lot of a Pizza Hut, where Atta is known to have eaten that day [83] [84] [85]\n\n\nFamily reaction and denial\nAtta's father vehemently rejected allegations his son was involved in the 9/11 attacks, and instead accused the Mossad and the United States government of having a hand in framing his son [26] Atta Sr rejected media reports that stated his son was drinking wildly, and instead described his son as a quiet boy uninvolved with politics, shy and devoted to studying architecture [98] The elder Mr Atta said he had spoken with Mohamed by phone the day after on 12 September 2001 He held interviews with the German news magazine Bild am Sonntag in late 2002, saying his son was alive and hiding in fear for his life, and that American Christians were responsible for the attacks [99] In an interview on 24 September 2001, Atta Sr stated, \"My son is gone He is now with God The Mossad killed him.\" [100]\n\n\nMistaken identity\nIn the aftermath of 9/11 attacks, the names of the hijackers were released There was some confusion regarding who Mohamed Atta was, and cases of mistaken identity Initially, Mohamed Atta's identity was confused with that of a native Jordanian, Mahmoud Mahmoud Atta, who bombed an Israeli bus in the West Bank in 1986, killing one and severely injuring three Mahmoud Atta was 14 years older than Mohamed Atta [102] Mahmoud Atta, a naturalized U.S citizen, was subsequently deported from Venezuela to the United States, extradited to Israel, tried, convicted, and sentenced to life in prison The Israeli Supreme Court later overturned his extradition and set him free [103] After the attacks, there were also reports stating that Mohamed Atta had attended the International Officers School at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama The Washington Post quoted a United States Air Force official who explained, \"discrepancies in their biographical data, such as birth dates 20 years off, indicate we are probably not talking about the same people.\" [104]\n\n\nPrague controversy\nIn the months following the 11 September attacks, officials at the Czech Interior Ministry asserted that Atta made a trip to Prague on 8 April 2001, to meet with an Iraqi intelligence agent named Ahmed Khalil Ibrahim Samir al-Ani This piece of information was passed on to the FBI as \"unevaluated raw intelligence\" [105] Intelligence officials have concluded that such a meeting did not occur A Pakistani businessman named Mohammed Atta had come to Prague from Saudi Arabia on 31 May 2000, with this second Atta possibly contributing to the confusion The Egyptian Mohamed Atta arrived at the Florenc bus terminal in Prague, from Germany, on 2 June 2000 He left Prague the next day, flying on Czech Airlines to Newark, New Jersey, U.S In the Czech Republic, some intelligence officials say the source of the purported meeting was an Arab informant who approached the Czech intelligence service with his sighting of Atta only after Atta's photograph had appeared in newspapers all over the world United States and Czech intelligence officials have since concluded that the person seen with Ani was mistakenly identified as Atta, and the consensus of investigators is that Atta never attended a meeting in Prague [106] [107] [108]\n\n\nAble Danger\nIn 2005, Army Lt Col Anthony Shaffer and Congressman Curt Weldon alleged that the Defense Department data mining project, Able Danger, produced a chart that identified Atta, along with Nawaf al-Hazmi, Khalid al-Mihdhar, and Marwan al-Shehhi, as members of a Brooklyn-based al-Qaeda cell in early 2000 [109] Shaffer largely based his allegations on the recollections of Navy Captain Scott Phillpott, [110] who later recanted his recollection, telling investigators that he was \"convinced that Atta was not on the chart that we had.\" Phillpott said that Shaffer was \"relying on my recollection 100 percent,\" and the Defense Department Inspector General's report indicated that Philpott \"may have exaggerated knowing Atta's identity because he supported using Able Danger's techniques to fight terrorism.\" [111] [112]\n\n\nAssessment and motivation\nThere are multiple, conflicting explanations for Atta's behavior and motivation Political psychologist Jerrold Post has suggested that Atta and his fellow hijackers were just following orders from al-Qaeda leadership, \"and whatever their destructive, charismatic leader Osama bin Laden said was the right thing to do for the sake of the cause was what they would do.\" [115] American political scientist Robert Pape asserts that Atta was motivated by his commitment to the political cause, that he was psychologically normal, and that he was \"not readily characterized as depressed, not unable to enjoy life, not detached from friends and society.\" [116] By contrast, criminal justice professor, Adam Lankford, has found evidence that indicated Atta was suicidal, and that his struggles with social isolation, depression, guilt, shame, hopelessness, and rage were extraordinarily similar to the struggles of those who commit conventional suicide and murder-suicide By this view, Atta's political and religious beliefs affected the method of his suicide and his choice of target, but they were not the underlying causes of his behavior [117] [page needed]\n\n\nSee

The two were seen getting gasoline at an Exxon gas station and visited the Longfellow House in Portland that afternoon. They arrived at the hotel at 5:43 pm and spent the night in Room 233. While in South Portland, they were seen making two ATM withdrawals and stopping at Wal-Mart. The FBI also reported that two Middle-Eastern men were seen in the parking lot of a Pizza Hut, where Atta is known to have eaten that day.\n\n**Family Reaction and Denial**\n\nAtta's father vehemently rejected allegations his son was involved in the 9/11 attacks, and instead accused the Mossad and the United States government of having a hand in framing his son. Atta Sr rejected media reports that stated his son was drinking wildly, and instead described his son as a quiet boy uninvolved with politics, shy and devoted to studying architecture. The elder Mr Atta said he had spoken with Mohamed by phone the day after on September 12, 2001. He held interviews with the German news magazine Bild am Sonntag in late 2002, saying his son was alive and hiding in fear for his life, and that American Christians were responsible for the attacks. In an interview on September 24, 2001, Atta Sr stated, \"My son is gone He is now with God The Mossad killed him.\"\n\n**Mistaken Identity**\n\nIn the aftermath of 9/11 attacks, the names of the hijackers were released. There was some confusion regarding who Mohamed Atta was, and cases of mistaken identity. Initially, Mohamed Atta's identity was confused with that of a native Jordanian, Mahmoud Mahmoud Atta, who bombed an Israeli bus in the West Bank in 1986, killing one and severely injuring three. Mahmoud Atta was 14 years older than Mohamed Atta. Mahmoud Atta, a naturalized U.S citizen, was subsequently deported from Venezuela to the United States, extradited to Israel, tried, convicted, and sentenced to life in prison. The Israeli Supreme Court later overturned his extradition and set him free.\n\n**Prague Controversy**\n\nIn the months following the 11 September attacks, officials at the Czech Interior Ministry asserted that Atta made a trip to Prague on April 8, 2001, to meet with an Iraqi intelligence agent named Ahmed Khalil Ibrahim Samir al-Ani. This piece of information was passed on to the FBI as \"unevaluated raw intelligence.\" Intelligence officials have concluded that such a meeting did not occur. A Pakistani businessman named Mohammed Atta had come to Prague from Saudi Arabia on May 31, 2000, with this second Atta possibly contributing to the confusion. The Egyptian Mohamed Atta arrived at the Florenc bus terminal in Prague, from Germany, on June 2, 2000. He left Prague the next day, flying on Czech Airlines to Newark, New Jersey, U.S.\n\n**Able Danger**\n\nIn 2005, Army Lt Col Anthony Shaffer and Congressman Curt Weldon alleged that the Defense Department data mining project, Able Danger, produced a chart that identified Atta, along with Nawaf al-Hazmi, Khalid al-Mihdhar, and Marwan al-Shehhi, as members of a Brooklyn-based al-Qaeda cell in early 2000. Shaffer largely based his allegations on the recollections of Navy Captain Scott Phillpott, who later recanted his recollection, telling investigators that he was \"convinced that Atta was not on the chart that we had.\" Phillpott said that Shaffer was \"relying on my recollection 100 percent,\" and the Defense Department Inspector General's report indicated that Philpott \"may have exaggerated knowing Atta's identity because he supported using Able Danger's techniques to fight terrorism.\"\n\n**Assessment and Motivation**\n\nThere are multiple, conflicting explanations for Atta's behavior and motivation. Political psychologist Jerrold Post has suggested that Atta and his fellow hijackers were just following orders from al-Qaeda leadership, \"and whatever their destructive, charismatic leader Osama bin Laden said was the right thing to do for the sake of the cause was what they would do.\" American political scientist Robert Pape asserts that Atta was motivated by his commitment to the political cause, that he was psychologically normal, and that he was \"not readily characterized as depressed, not unable to enjoy life, not detached from friends and society.\" By contrast, criminal justice professor, Adam Lankford, has found evidence that indicated Atta was suicidal, and that his struggles with social isolation, depression, guilt, shame, hopelessness, and rage were extraordinarily similar to the struggles of those who commit conventional suicide and murder-suicide. By this view, Atta's political and religious beliefs affected the method of his suicide and his choice of target, but they were not the underlying causes of his behavior.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mohamed_Atta\" following this outline:\n\n\nAliases\nMohamed Atta had varied his name on documents, also using \"Mehan Atta\", \"Mohammad El Amir\", \"Muhammad Atta\", \"Mohamed El Sayed\", \"Mohamed Elsayed\", \"Muhammad al-Amir\", \"Awag Al Sayyid Atta\", and \"Awad Al Sayad\" [1] In Germany, he registered his name as \"Mohamed el-Amir Awad el-Sayed Atta\", and went by the name Mohamed el-Amir at the Hamburg University of Technology [2] In his will, written in 1996, Atta gives his name as \"Mohamed the son of Mohamed Elamir awad Elsayed\" [3] He was known as Abd al-Rahman al-Misri by al-Qaeda Atta also claimed different nationalities, sometimes Egyptian and other times telling people he was from the United Arab Emirates [2]\n\n\nEarly life\nMohamed Atta was born on 1 September 1968, in Kafr el-Sheikh, located in the Nile Delta region of Egypt (then a part of the United Arab Republic) [4] His father, Mohamed el-Amir Awad el-Sayed Atta, was a lawyer, educated in both civil law and sharia His mother, Buthayna Mohamed Mustafa Shiraqi, came from a wealthy farming and trading family and was also educated Buthayna and Mohamed married when she was 14, via an arranged marriage The family had few relatives on the father's side and kept their distance from Buthayna's family In-laws characterized Atta's father as \"austere, strict, and private\", and neighbors viewed the family as reclusive [5] Atta was the only son; he had two older sisters who are both well-educated and successful in their careers – one as a medical doctor and the other as a professor [6]\n\n\nGermany\nAtta graduated from Cairo University with marks insufficient for the graduate program As his father insisted that he go abroad for graduate studies, Atta, to this end, entered a German-language program at the Goethe-Institut in Cairo [13] In 1992, his father overheard a German couple who were visiting Egypt's capital The couple explained at dinner that they ran an exchange program and invited Atta to continue his studies in Germany; they also offered him room and board at their home in the city Atta accepted and arrived in Germany two weeks later, in July.\n\n\nAcademic studies\nAt the Hamburg University of Technology, Atta studied under the guidance of the department chair, Dittmar Machule, who specialized in the Middle East [18] Atta was averse to modern development This included the construction of high-rise buildings in Cairo and other ancient cities in the region He believed that the drab and impersonal apartment blocks, built in the 60s and 70s, ruined the beauty of old neighborhoods and robbed their people of privacy and dignity Atta's family moved into an apartment block in 1990; it was to him but \"a shabby symbol of Egypt's haphazard attempts to modernize and its shameless embrace of the West.\" [9] For his thesis, Atta concentrated on the ancient Syrian city of Aleppo He researched the history of the urban landscape in relation to the general theme of conflict between Arab and modern civilization He criticized how the newfangled skyscrapers and other modernizing projects disrupted the fabric of communities by blocking common streets and altering the skyline.\n\n\nReligious zeal and Hamburg cell\nAfter coming to Hamburg in 1992, Atta grew more religiously fanatical and frequented the mosque with greater regularity [28] His friends in Germany described him as an intelligent man in whom religious convictions and political motives held equal sway He harbored anger and resentment toward the U.S for its policy in Islamic nations of the Middle East, with nothing inflaming his ire more than the Oslo Accords and the Gulf War in particular [29] [30] He was also angry and bitter at the elite in his native Egypt, who he believed hoarded power for themselves, as well as at the Egyptian government, that cracked down on the dissident Muslim Brotherhood [31] Atta was anti-Semitic, believing that Jews controlled the world's media, financial, and political institutions from New York City [32] These beliefs were even stronger during Operation Infinite Reach, as he believed that Monica Lewinsky was a Jewish agent influencing American president Bill Clinton against aiding Palestine, which would later play a key role in creating the Hamburg cell [33]\n\n\nUnited States\nOn 22 March 2000, Atta was still in Germany when he sent an e-mail to the Academy of Lakeland in Florida He inquired about flight training, \"Dear sir, we are a small group of young men from different Arab countries Now, we are living in Germany since a while for study purposes We would like to start training for the career of airline professional pilots In this field, we haven't yet any knowledge but we are ready to undergo an intensive training program (up to ATP and eventually higher).\" Atta sent 50–60 similar e-mails to other flight training schools in the United States [55]\n\n\nJuly 2001 summit in Spain\nIn July 2001, Atta again left for Spain in order to meet with bin al-Shibh for the last time On 7 July 2001, Atta flew on Swissair Flight 117 from Miami to Zürich, where he had a stopover [70] On 8 July, Atta was recorded on surveillance video when he withdrew 1700 Swiss francs from an ATM He used his credit card to purchase two Swiss Army knives and some chocolate in a shop at the Zurich Airport [71] After the stopover in Zürich, he arrived in Madrid at 4:45 pm on Swissair Flight 656, and spent several hours at the airport Then at 8:50 pm, he checked into the Hotel Diana Cazadora in Barajas, a town near the airport That night and twice the next morning, he called Bashar Ahmad Ali Musleh, a Jordanian student in Hamburg who served as a liaison for bin al-Shibh [72]\n\n\nFinal plans in the U.S.\nOn 22 July 2001, Atta rented a Mitsubishi Galant from Alamo Rent a Car, putting 3,836 miles (6,173 km) on the vehicle before returning it on 26 July On 25 July, Atta dropped Ziad Jarrah off at Miami International Airport for a flight back to Germany On 26 July, Atta traveled via Continental Airlines to Newark, New Jersey, checked into the Kings Inn Hotel in Wayne, New Jersey, and stayed there until 30 July when he took a flight from Newark back to Fort Lauderdale [10]\n\n\n9/11 attacks and death\nOn 10 September 2001, Atta picked up al-Omari

extradited to Israel, tried, convicted, and sentenced to life in prison The Israeli Supreme Court later overturned his extradition and set him free [103] After the attacks, there were also reports stating that Mohamed Atta had attended the International Officers School at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama The Washington Post quoted a United States Air Force official who explained, \"discrepancies in their biographical data, such as birth dates 20 years off, indicate we are probably not talking about the same people.\" [104]\n\n\nPrague controversy\nIn the months following the 11 September attacks, officials at the Czech Interior Ministry asserted that Atta made a trip to Prague on 8 April 2001, to meet with an Iraqi intelligence agent named Ahmed Khalil Ibrahim Samir

Prague, from Germany, on 2 June 2000 He left Prague the next day, flying on Czech Airlines to Newark, New Jersey, U.S In the Czech Republic, some intelligence officials say the source of the purported meeting was an Arab informant who approached the Czech intelligence service with his sighting of Atta only after Atta's photograph had appeared in newspapers all over the world United States and Czech intelligence officials have since concluded that the person seen with Ani was mistakenly identified as Atta, and the consensus of investigators is that Atta never attended a meeting in Prague [106] [107] [108]\n\n\nAble Danger\nIn 2005, Army Lt Col Anthony Shaffer and Congressman Curt Weldon alleged that the Defense Department data mining project, Able Danger, produced a chart that identified

a farm near Dyersville was used for the Kinsella home; an empty warehouse in Dubuque was used to build various interior sets Galena, Illinois, served as Moonlight Graham's Chisholm, Minnesota [8] One week was spent on location shots in Boston, most notably Fenway Park [12]\n\n\nField\nScenes of the Kinsella farm were taken on the property of Don Lansing in Dyersville, Iowa;

it's a mix of fairy tale, baseball, and family togetherness.\" [17] On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 57 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\" [18] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on scale of A+ to F [19]\n\n\nAccolades\nThe film was nominated for three Academy Awards in 1990: Best Picture (Gordon & Gordon), Best Adapted Screenplay (Robinson), and Best Original Score (Horner) [26] It did not win in any category.\n\n\nHome media\nThe film was released on VHS in 1989 It was later released on DVD on April 29, 1998 [39] It was released on Blu-ray on March 13, 2011 [39] It was released on 4K UHD Blu-Ray on May 14, 2019, for the film's 30th anniversary [40]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe ballpark that was built for the movie is maintained as a tourist attraction.\n\n\nMLB at Field of Dreams\nIn 2019, Major League Baseball announced that it would hold a neutral-site regular season game between the Chicago White Sox and New York Yankees at the Dyersville site on August 13, 2020, playing on an 8,000-seat field constructed adjacent to the original, with a pathway connecting the two The field would be modeled after the White Sox's former field, Comiskey Park (1910–1990) [45] In July 2020, because of the shortened 2020 Major League Baseball season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was announced that the White Sox would be playing the St Louis Cardinals instead of the Yankees [46] On August 3, 2020, Major League Baseball announced that the 2020 game was cancelled due to logistics [47]\n\n\nTelevision series proposal\nIn August 2021, plans were announced to remake the film as a television series, produced by Lawrence Gordon and written by Michael Schur, for Peacock [54] In June 2022, it was revealed it was no longer moving forward as Peacock and Universal Television had begun shopping the project elsewhere [55] Chris Pratt had reportedly agreed to star in the series before dropping out, with the series said to have had a budget of $15 million per episode [56] [57]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Field of Dreams\n\nField of Dreams is a 1989 American sports fantasy drama film directed by Phil Alden Robinson and written by Robinson and W.P.
