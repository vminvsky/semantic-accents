The club was founded in 1932 by Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts on the 365-acre site of a former nursery and antebellum plantation called Fruitland. Jones sought to create a world-class winter golf course in his native state of Georgia.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\nAugusta National was founded in 1932 by Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts on the 365-acre site of a former nursery and antebellum plantation called Fruitland. Jones sought to create a world-class winter golf course in his native state of Georgia. During the first decade of the club's existence, membership was low and finances were short due to the Great Depression and the relatively remote location of Augusta, forcing the duo to scrap future plans for a \"ladies' course\", squash and tennis courts, and various estates.\n\nFacilities and Grounds\n----------------------\n\nAugusta National is renowned for its well-maintained impeccable appearance. Pine needles are imported, bird sounds are played on inconspicuous speakers, and even the ponds were once dyed blue. The club is famed for its azaleas and dogwoods.\n\nBerckmans Place\n----------------\n\nBerckmans Place, sometimes called Berckmans or BP, is a 90,000-sq.-ft non-public shopping and dining complex built in 2012. It operates for one week each year, during the Masters. Entry passes for the week cost $10,000 (up from $6,000) and require Augusta National's approval; there is a 10-ticket limit. As in the rest of the club, neither cell phones nor photography are allowed. The price includes free dining at Berckmans' five full-service restaurants, each of which can seat hundreds of guests: Augusta's Seafood, Calamity Jane's, Ike's Place, MacKenzie's Pub, and the Pavilion. Bathroom stalls are attended and cleaned after each use. There is a pro shop and four putting greens dubbed the \"Putting Experience\": three slightly smaller replicas of holes 7, 14, and 16; and a \"composite course\". BP customers can use an exclusive parking lot and entryway (Gate 9). The complex is located near hole 5.\n\nCourse\n-------\n\nThe course was formerly a plant nursery, and each hole on the course is named after the tree or shrub with which it has become associated. Several of the holes on the first nine have been renamed, as well as hole #11.\n\nAmen Corner\n------------\n\nThe second shot at the 11th, all of the 12th, and the first two shots at the 13th hole at Augusta are nicknamed \"Amen Corner\". This term was first used in print by author Herbert Warren Wind in his April 21, 1958, Sports Illustrated article about the Masters that year. In a Golf Digest article in April 1984, 26 years later, Wind told about its origin. He said he wanted a catchy phrase like baseball's \"hot-corner\" or American football's \"coffin-corner\" to explain where some of the most exciting golf had taken place. Thus \"Amen Corner\" was born. He said it came from the title of a jazz record he had heard in the mid-1930s by a group led by Chicago's Mezz Mezzrow, Shouting in that Amen Corner.\n\n\"The Big Oak Tree\"\n-----------------\n\n\"The Big Oak Tree\" is on the golf course side of the clubhouse and was planted in the 1850s.\n\nEisenhower Tree\n----------------\n\nAlso known as the \"Eisenhower Pine\", a loblolly pine was located on the 17th hole, about 210 yards from the Masters tee. President Dwight D Eisenhower, an Augusta National member, hit the tree so many times that, at a 1956 club meeting, he proposed that it be cut down. Not wanting to offend the president, the club's chairman, Clifford Roberts, immediately adjourned the meeting rather than reject the request. In February 2014, the Eisenhower Tree was removed after suffering extensive damage during an ice storm.\n\nIke's Pond\n------------\n\nDuring a visit to Augusta National, then-General Eisenhower returned from a walk through the woods on the eastern part of the grounds, and informed Clifford Roberts that he had found a perfect place to build a dam if the club would like a fish pond. Ike's Pond was built for Eisenhower to fish in and named after him; the dam is located just where Eisenhower said it should be.\n\nRae's Creek\n-------------\n\nRae's Creek cuts across the southeastern corner of the Augusta National property. Rae's Creek runs in front of No 12 green, has a tributary evident at No 13 tee, and flows at the back of No 11 green. This is the lowest point in elevation of the course. The Hogan and Nelson Bridges cross the creek after the 12th and 13th tee boxes, respectively. The creek was named after former property owner John Rae, who died in 1789. It was Rae's house which was the farthest fortress up the Savannah River from Fort Augusta. The house kept residents safe during Indian attacks when the fort was out of reach.\n\nReal Estate\n-------------\n\nOver the decades, Augusta National has bought and redeveloped nearby land. From 1999 to 2019, the club spent about $200 million to buy 100 separate properties totaling over 270 acres, some more than a mile distant from the club proper. Most purchases are arranged via LLCs connected to Augusta National in order to obfuscate the transaction's details. More than a dozen of these LLCs are known to exist, and up to five may be involved in a single purchase. Augusta National ultimately purchases each LLC, acquiring its land holdings and keeping the real estate price away from public records. Non-disclosure agreements are also commonly employed.\n\nMembership\n------------\n\nAugusta National Golf Club has about 300 members at any given time. Membership is strictly by invitation: there is no application process. In 2004, USA Today published a list of all the current members. Membership is believed to cost between $100,000 and $300,000 and annual dues were estimated in 2020 to be less than $30,000 per year. Club members are sometimes referred to as \"green jackets\".\n\nNotable Members\n----------------\n\nNotable current members include [list of notable members].\n\nChairmen\n---------\n\nChairmen serve for an indefinite amount of time. The chairman is the only person officially authorized to publicly discuss the Masters.\n\n2002 Membership Controversy\n---------------------------\n\nAugusta National and its then-Chairman Hootie Johnson are widely known for their disagreement, beginning in 2002, with Martha Burk, then chair of the Washington-based National Council of Women's Organizations; the dispute arose over Augusta National's refusal to admit female members to the club. Burk said she found out about the club's policies in a USA Today column published April 11, 2002. She then wrote a private letter to Johnson, saying that hosting the Masters Tournament at a male-only club constituted sexism. Johnson characterized Burk's approach as \"offensive and coercive\". The club hired consulting firm WomanTrend, which ran a survey and found that \"Augusta National's membership policies were not topmost on the list of women's concerns\"; the poll was called \"unethical\" by Burk. Responding to efforts to link the issue to sexism and civil rights, Johnson maintained that the issue had to do with the rights of any private club.\n\nGreen Jacket\n-------------\n\nEvery member of Augusta National receives a green sport coat with the club's logo on the left breast. Members are required to wear them during the tournament, and the jackets are not allowed to be removed from the grounds. The idea of the green jacket originated with club co-founder Clifford Roberts. Many believe it was because he wanted patrons visiting during the tournament to be able to readily identify members. Since Sam Snead's victory in 1949, the winner of each year's Masters Tournament has received a green jacket, although he does not receive membership. The jacket is presented to the new winner by the winner of the previous tournament. If the previous champion is either unavailable or has won consecutive tournaments, then the current chairman acts as the presenter. Until 1967, the jackets were manufactured by Brooks Brothers and since have been made by Hamilton of Cincinnati, Ohio, with the imp wool produced at the Victor Forstmann plant in Dublin, Georgia.\n\nCaddies\n---------\n\nAugusta National employs a staff of caddies to assist members, guests, and professionals. Augusta's caddie staff wears trademark white jumpsuits year-round.\n\nAppearances in Video Games\n-----------------------------\n\nAugusta National Golf Club is featured in the Japan-exclusive video game franchise Harukanaru Augusta, which started in 1989. The games were produced by T&E Soft, one of its last titles Masters '98: Haruka Naru Augusta was released for the Nintendo 64.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Augusta_National_Golf_Club\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nAugusta National was founded in 1932 by Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts on the 365-acre site of a former nursery/antebellum plantation called Fruitland (later Fruitlands) [9] Jones sought to create a world-class winter golf course in his native state of Georgia During the first decade of the club's existence, membership was low and finances were short due to the Great Depression and the relatively remote location of Augusta, forcing the duo to scrap future plans for a \"ladies' course\", squash and tennis courts, and various estates [5]\n\n\nFacilities and grounds\nAugusta is renowned for its well-maintained impeccable appearance: pine needles are imported, bird sounds are played on inconspicuous speakers, and even the ponds were once dyed blue [5] The club is famed for its azaleas and dogwoods [1]\n\n\nBerckmans Place\nBerckmans Place, sometimes called Berckmans or BP, [11] is a 90,000-sq.-ft non-public shopping and dining complex built in 2012 It operates for one week each year, during the Masters Entry passes for the week cost $10,000 (up from $6,000) [12] and require Augusta National's approval; there is a 10-ticket limit [11] As in the rest of the club, neither cell phones nor photography are allowed The price includes free dining at Berckmans' five full-service restaurants, each of which can seat hundreds of guests: Augusta's Seafood, [13] Calamity Jane's, Ike's Place, MacKenzie's Pub, and the Pavilion Bathroom stalls are attended and cleaned after each use [5] There is a pro shop [12] and four putting greens dubbed the \"Putting Experience\": three slightly smaller replicas of holes 7, 14, and 16; and a \"composite course\" [11] [12] [13] BP customers can use an exclusive parking lot and entryway (Gate 9) [11] The complex is located near hole 5 [14]\n\n\nCourse\nThe course was formerly a plant nursery, [16] and each hole on the course is named after the tree or shrub with which it has become associated Several of the holes on the first nine have been renamed, as well as hole #11 [17]\n\n\nAmen Corner\nThe second shot at the 11th, all of the 12th, and the first two shots at the 13th hole at Augusta are nicknamed \"Amen Corner\" This term was first used in print by author Herbert Warren Wind [5] in his April 21, 1958, Sports Illustrated article about the Masters that year [26] In a Golf Digest article in April 1984, 26 years later, Wind told about its origin He said he wanted a catchy phrase like baseball's \"hot-corner\" or American football's \"coffin-corner\" to explain where some of the most exciting golf had taken place (the Palmer-Venturi rules issue at twelve, over an embedded ball ruling and how it was handled, [27] in particular) Thus \"Amen Corner\" was born He said it came from the title of a jazz record he had heard in the mid-1930s by a group led by Chicago's Mezz Mezzrow, Shouting in that Amen Corner [28]\n\n\n\"The Big Oak Tree\"\n\"The Big Oak Tree\" is on the golf course side of the clubhouse and was planted in the 1850s [29]\n\n\nEisenhower Tree\nAlso known as the \"Eisenhower Pine\", a loblolly pine was located on the 17th hole, about 210 yards (190 m) from the Masters tee President Dwight D Eisenhower, an Augusta National member, hit the tree so many times that, at a 1956 club meeting, he proposed that it be cut down [30] Not wanting to offend the president, the club's chairman, Clifford Roberts, immediately adjourned the meeting rather than reject the request In February 2014, the Eisenhower Tree was removed after suffering extensive damage during an ice storm [31]\n\n\nIke's Pond\nDuring a visit to Augusta National, then-General Eisenhower returned from a walk through the woods on the eastern part of the grounds, and informed Clifford Roberts that he had found a perfect place to build a dam if the club would like a fish pond Ike's Pond was built for Eisenhower to fish in and named after him;

{"title": "Albania", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe historical origins of the term \"Albania\" can be traced back to medieval Latin, with its foundations believed to be associated with the Illyrian tribe of the Albani This connection gains further support from the work of the Ancient Greek geographer Ptolemy during the 2nd century AD, where he included the settlement of Albanopolis situated to the northeast of Durrës [12] [13] The presence of a medieval settlement named Albanon or Arbanon hints at the possibility of historical continuity The precise relationship among these historical references and the question of whether Albanopolis was synonymous with Albanon remain subjects of scholarly debate [14]\n\n\nHistory\nMesolithic habitation in Albania has been evidenced in several open air sites which during that period were close to the Adriatic coastline and in cave sites Mesolithic objects found in a cave near Xarrë include flint and jasper objects along with fossilised animal bones, while those discoveries at Mount Dajt comprise bone and stone tools similar to those of the Aurignacian culture [22] The Neolithic era in Albania began around 7000 BC and is evidenced in finds which indicate domestication of sheep and goats and small-scale agriculture A part of the Neolithic population may have been the same as the Mesolithic population of the southern Balkans like in the Konispol cave where the Mesolithic stratum co-exists with Pre-Pottery Neolithic finds Cardium pottery culture appears in coastal Albania and across the Adriatic after 6500 BC, while the settlements of the interior took part in the processes which formed the Starčevo culture [23] The Albanian bitumen mines of Selenicë provide early evidence of bitumen exploitation in Europe, dating to Late Neolithic Albania (from 5000 BC), when local communities used it as pigment for ceramic decoration, waterproofing, and adhesive for reparing broken vessels The bitumen of Selenicë circulated towards eastern Albania from the early 5th millennium BC First evidence of its overseas trade export comes from Neolithic and Bronze Age southern Italy The high-quality bitumen of Selenicë has been exploited throughout all the historical ages since the Late Neolithic era until today [24]\n\n\nPrehistory\nMesolithic habitation in Albania has been evidenced in several open air sites which during

from the early 5th millennium BC First evidence of its overseas trade export comes from Neolithic and Bronze Age southern Italy The high-quality bitumen of Selenicë has been exploited throughout all the historical ages since the Late Neolithic era until today [24]\n\n\nAntiquity\nThe incorporated territory of Albania was historically inhabited by Indo-European peoples, amongst them numerous Illyrian and Epirote tribes There were also several Greek colonies The territory referred to as Illyria corresponded roughly to the area east of the Adriatic Sea in the Mediterranean Sea extending in the south to the mouth of the Vjosë [28] [29] The first account of the Illyrian groups comes from Periplus of the Euxine Sea, a Greek text written in the 4th century BC [30] The Bryges were also present in central Albania, while the south was inhabited by the Epirote Chaonians, whose capital was at Phoenice [30] [31] [32] Other colonies such as Apollonia and Epidamnos were established by Greek city-states on the coast by the 7th century BC [30] [33] [34]\n\n\nMiddle Ages\nThe Roman Empire was split in 395 upon the death of Theodosius I into an Eastern and Western Roman Empire in part because of the increasing pressure from threats during the Barbarian Invasions From the 6th century into the 7th century, the Slavs crossed the Danube and largely absorbed the indigenous Greeks, Illyrians and Thracians in the Balkans; thus, the Illyrians were mentioned for the last time in historical records in the 7th century [41] [42]\n\n\nOttoman Empire\nWith the fall of Constantinople, the Ottoman Empire continued an extended period of conquest and expansion with its borders going deep into Southeast Europe They reached the Albanian Ionian Sea Coast in 1385 and erected their garrisons across Southern Albania in 1415 and then occupied most of Albania in 1431 [54] [55] Thousands of Albanians consequently fled to Western Europe, particularly to Calabria, Naples, Ragusa and Sicily, whereby others sought protection at the often inaccessible Mountains of Albania [56] [57] The Albanians, as Christians, were considered an inferior class of people, and as such they were subjected to heavy taxes among others by the Devshirme system that allowed the Sultan to collect a requisite percentage of Christian adolescents from their families to compose the Janissary [58] The Ottoman conquest was also accompanied with the gradual process of Islamisation and the rapid construction of mosques.\n\n\nRilindja\nThe Albanian Renaissance was a period with its roots in the late 18th century and continuing into the 19th century, during which the Albanian people gathered spiritual and intellectual strength for an independent cultural and political life within an independent nation Modern Albanian culture flourished too, especially Albanian literature and arts, and was frequently linked to the influences of the Romanticism and Enlightenment principles [69] Prior to the rise of nationalism, Ottoman authorities suppressed any expression of national unity or conscience by the Albanian people.\n\n\nIndependence\nAlbania declared independence from the Ottoman Empire on 28 November 1912, accompanied by the establishment of the Senate and Government by the Assembly of Vlorë on 4 December 1912 [74] [75] [76] [77] Its sovereignty was recognized by the Conference of London On 29 July 1913, the Treaty of London delineated the borders of the country and its neighbors, leaving many Albanians outside Albania, predominantly partitioned between Montenegro, Serbia, and Greece [78]\n\n\nFirst Republic\nThe interwar period in Albania was marked by persistent economic and social difficulties, political instability and foreign interventions [91] [92] After World War I, Albania lacked an established government and internationally recognized borders, rendering it vulnerable to neighboring entities such as Greece, Italy, and Yugoslavia, all of which sought to expand their influence [91] This led to political uncertainty, highlighted in 1918 when the Congress of Durrës sought Paris Peace Conference protection but was denied, further complicating Albania's position on the international stage Territorial tensions escalated as Yugoslavia, particularly Serbia, sought control of northern Albania, while Greece aimed dominance in southern Albania The situation deteriorated in 1919 when the Serbs launched attacks on Albanian inhabitants, among others in Gusinje and Plav, resulting in massacres and large-scale displacement [91] [93] [94] Meanwhile, Italian influence continued to expand during this time, driven by economic interests and political ambitions [92] [95]\n\n\nCommunism\nThe establishment of the People's Republic of Albania under the leadership of Enver Hoxha was a significant epoch in modern Albanian history [101] Hoxha's regime embraced Marxist–Leninist ideologies and implemented authoritarian policies, including prohibition of religious practices, severe restrictions on travel, and abolition of private property rights [102] It was also defined by a persistent pattern of purges, extensive repression, instances of betrayal, and hostility to external influences [102] Any form of opposition or resistance to his rule was met with expeditious and severe consequences, such as internal exile, extended imprisonment, and execution [102] The regime confronted a multitude of challenges, including widespread poverty, illiteracy, health crises and gender inequality [100] In response, Hoxha initiated a modernization initiative aimed at attaining economic and social liberation and transforming Albania into an industrial society [100] The regime placed a high priority on the diversification of the economy through Soviet-style industrialization, comprehensive infrastructure development such as the introduction of a transformative railway system, expansion of education and healthcare services, elimination of adult illiteracy, and targeted advancements in areas such as women's rights [103] [104] [105] [106]\n\n\nFourth Republic\nAfter four decades of communism paired with the revolutions of 1989, Albania witnessed a notable rise in political activism, particularly among students, which led to a transformation in the prevailing order After the first multi-party elections of 1991, the communist party maintained a stronghold in the parliament until its defeat in the parliamentary elections of 1992 directed by the Democratic Party [109] Considerable economic and financial resources were devoted to pyramid schemes that were widely supported by the government The schemes swept up somewhere between one sixth and one third of the population of the country [110] [111] Despite the International Monetary Fund's warnings, Sali Berisha defended the schemes as large investment firms, leading more people to redirect their remittances and sell their homes and cattle for cash to deposit in the schemes [112]\n\n\nContemporary\nAfter its communist system disintegrated, Albania embarked on an active path toward Westernization with the ambition to obtain membership in the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) [115] A notable milestone was reached in 2009, when the country attained membership in NATO, marking a pioneering achievement among the nations of Southeast Europe [116] [117] In adherence to its vision for further integration into the EU, it formally applied for membership on 28 April 2009 [118] Another milestone was reached on 24 June 2014, when the country was granted official candidate status [119]\n\n\nEnvironment\nAlbania lies along the Mediterranean Sea on the Balkan Peninsula in South and Southeast Europe, and has an area of 28,748 km2 (11,100 sq mi) [135] It is bordered by the Adriatic Sea to the west, Montenegro to the northwest, Kosovo to the northeast, North Macedonia to the east, Greece to the south, and the Ionian Sea to the southwest It is between latitudes 42° and 39° N and longitudes 21° and 19° E Geographic coordinates include Vërmosh at 42° 35' 34\" northern latitude as the northernmost point, Konispol at 39° 40' 0\" northern latitude as the southernmost, Sazan at 19° 16' 50\" eastern longitude as the westernmost, and Vërnik at 21° 1' 26\" eastern longitude as the easternmost [136] Mount Korab, rising at 2,764 m (9,068.24 ft) above the Adriatic, is the highest point, while the Mediterranean Sea, at 0 m (0.00 ft), is the lowest The country extends 148 km (92 mi) from east to west and around 340 km (211 mi) from north to south.\n\n\nGeography\nAlbania lies along the Mediterranean Sea on the Balkan Peninsula in South and Southeast Europe, and has an area of 28,748 km2 (11,100 sq mi) [135] It is bordered by the Adriatic Sea to the west, Montenegro to the northwest, Kosovo to the northeast, North Macedonia to the east, Greece to the south, and the Ionian Sea to the southwest It is between

the Adriatic, is the highest point, while the Mediterranean Sea, at 0 m (0.00 ft), is the lowest The country extends 148 km (92 mi) from east to west and around 340 km (211 mi) from north to south.\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate of Albania exhibits a distinguished level of variability and diversity due to the differences in latitude, longitude and altitude [141] [142] Albania experiences a Mediterranean and Continental climate, characterised by the presence of four distinct seasons [143] According to the Köppen classification, Albania encompasses five primary climatic types, spanning from Mediterranean and subtropical in the western half to oceanic, continental and subarctic in the eastern half of the country [144] The coastal regions along the Adriatic and Ionian Seas in Albania are acknowledged as the warmest areas, while the northern and eastern regions encompassing the Albanian Alps and the Korab Mountains are recognised as the coldest areas in the country [145] Throughout the year, the average monthly temperatures fluctuate, ranging from −1 °C (30 °F) during the winter months to 21.8 °C (71.2 °F) in the summer months Notably, the highest recorded temperature of 43.9 °C (111.0 °F) was observed in Kuçovë on 18 July 1973, while the lowest temperature of −29 °C (−20 °F) was recorded in Shtyllë, Librazhd on 9 January 2017 [146] [147]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nA biodiversity hotspot, Albania possesses an exceptionally rich and contrasting biodiversity on account of its geographical location at the centre of the Mediterranean Sea and the great diversity in its climatic, geological and hydrological conditions [149] [150] Because of remoteness, the mountains and hills of Albania are endowed with forests, trees and grasses that are essential to the lives for a wide variety of animals, among others for two of the most endangered species of the country, the lynx and brown bear, as well as the wildcat, grey wolf, red fox, golden jackal, Egyptian vulture and golden eagle, the latter constituting the national animal of the country [151] [152] [153] [154]\n\n\nConservation\nAlbania has been an active participant in numerous international agreements and conventions aimed at strengthing its commitment to the preservation and sustainable management of biological diversity Since 1994, the country is a party to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and its associated Cartagena and Nagoya Protocols [159] To uphold these commitments, it has developed and implemented a comprehensive National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) [159] Furthermore, Albania has established a partnership with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), advancing its conservation efforts on both national and international scales Guided by the IUCN, the country has made substantial progress in the foundation of protected areas within its boundaries, encompassing 12 national parks among others Butrint, Karaburun-Sazan, Llogara, Prespa and Vjosa [160]\n\n\nProtected areas\nThe protected areas of Albania are areas designated and managed by the Albanian government There are 12 national parks, 4 ramsar sites, 1 biosphere reserve and 786 other types of conservation reserves in Albania [160] [165] Located in the north, the Albanian Alps National Park, comprising the former Theth National Park and Valbonë Valley National Park, is surrounded amidst the towering peaks of the Albanian Alps In the east, portions of the rugged Korab, Nemërçka and Shebenik Mountains are conserved within the boundaries of Fir of Hotovë-Dangëlli National Park, Shebenik National Park and Prespa National Park, with the latter encompassing Albania's share of the Great and Small Lakes of Prespa.\n\n\nEnvironmental issues\nEnvironmental issues in Albania notably encompass air and water pollution, climate change impacts, waste management shortcomings, biodiversity loss and imperative for nature conservation [166] [167] Climate change is predicted to exert significant impacts on the quality of life in Albania [168] The country is recognised as vulnerable to climate change impacts, ranked 79 among 181 countries in the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index of 2020 [169] Factors that account for the country's vulnerability to climate change risks include geological and hydrological hazards, including earthquakes, flooding, fires, landslides, torrential rains, river and coastal erosion [170] [171]\n\n\nPolitics\nSince declaring independence in 1912, Albania has experienced a significant political transformation, traversing through distinct periods that included a monarchical rule, a communist regime and the eventual establishment of a democratic order [176] In 1998, Albania transitioned into a sovereign parliamentary constitutional republic, marking a fundamental milestone in its political evolution [177] Its governance structure operates under a constitution that serves as the principal document of the country [178] The constitution is grounded in the principle of the separation of powers, with three arms of government that encompass the legislative embodied in the Parliament, the executive led by the President as the ceremonial head of state and the Prime Minister as the functional head of government, and the judiciary with a hierarchy of courts, including the constitutional and supreme courts as well as multiple appeal and administrative courts [177]\n\n\nForeign relations\nEmerging from decades of isolation during the communism, Albania has adopted a foreign policy orientation centered on active cooperation and engagement in international affairs At the core of Albania's foreign policies lie a set of objectives, which encompass the commitment to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity, the cultivation of diplomatic ties with other countries, advocating for international recognition of Kosovo, addressing the concerns related to the expulsion of Cham Albanians, pursuing Euro-Atlantic integration and protecting the rights of the Albanians in Kosovo, Greece, Italy, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and the diaspora [182]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Albanian Armed Forces consist of Land, Air and Naval Forces and constitute the military and paramilitary forces of the country They are led by a commander-in-chief under the supervision of the Ministry of Defence and by the President as the supreme commander during wartime However, in times of peace its powers are executed through the Prime Minister and the Defence Minister [189]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nAlbania is defined within a territorial area of 28,748 km2 (11,100 sq mi) in the Balkan Peninsula It is informally divided into three regions, the Northern, Central and Southern Regions Since its Declaration of Independence in 1912, Albania has reformed its internal organization 21 times Presently, the primary administrative units are the twelve constituent counties (qarqe/qarqet), which hold equal status under the law [198] Counties had previously been used in the 1950s and were recreated on 31 July 2000 to unify the 36 districts (rrathë/rrathët) of that time [199] [200] The largest county in Albania by population is Tirana County with over 800,000 people The smallest county, by population, is Gjirokastër County with over 70,000 people The largest county, by area, is Korçë County encompassing 3,711 square kilometres (1,433 sq mi) of the southeast of Albania The smallest county, by area, is Durrës County with an area of 766 square kilometres (296 sq mi) in the west of Albania.\n\n\nEconomy\nAlbania's transition from a socialist planned economy to a capitalist mixed economy has been largely successful [209] The country has a developing mixed economy classified by the World Bank as an upper-middle income economy In 2016, it had the fourth-lowest unemployment rate in the Balkans with an estimated value of 14.7% Its largest trading partners are Italy, Greece, China, Spain, Kosovo and the United States The lek (ALL) is the country's currency and is pegged at approximately 132.51 lek per euro.\n\n\nPrimary sector\nAgriculture in the country is based on small to medium-sized family-owned dispersed units It remains a significant sector of the economy of Albania It employs 41% [216] of the population, and about 24.31% of the land is used for agricultural purposes One of the earliest farming sites in Europe has been found in the southeast of the country [217] As part of the pre-accession process of Albania to the European Union, farmers are being aided through IPA funds to improve Albanian agriculture standards [218]\n\n\nSecondary sector\nAlbania's secondary sector has undergone many changes and diversification since the communist regime collapsed It is very diversified, from electronics, manufacturing, [223] textiles, to food, cement, mining, [224] and energy The Antea Cement plant in Fushë-Krujë is considered one of the nation's largest industrial greenfield investments [225] Albanian oil and gas is one of the most promising, albeit strictly regulated, sectors of its economy Albania has the second-largest oil deposits in the Balkan peninsula after Romania, and the largest oil reserves [226] in Europe The Albpetrol company is owned by the Albanian state and monitors the state petroleum agreements in the country The textile industry has seen an extensive expansion by approaching companies from the European Union (EU) in Albania According to the Instituti i Statistikës (INSTAT), as of 2016 [update], textile production had an annual growth of 5.3% and an annual turnover of around 1.5 billion euros [227]\n\n\nTertiary sector\nThe tertiary sector represents the fastest growing sector of the country's economy 36% of the population work in the service sector which contributes to 65% of the country's GDP [230] Ever since the end of the 20th century, the banking industry is a major component of the tertiary sector and remains in good conditions overall due to privatisation and the commendable monetary policy [231] [230]\n\n\nTransport\nTransportation in Albania is managed within the functions of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy and entities such as the Albanian Road Authority (ARRSH), responsible for the construction and maintenance of the highways and motorways in Albania, as well as the Albanian Aviation Authority (AAC), with the responsibility of coordinating civil aviation and airports in the country.\n\n\nInfrastructure\nIn Albania, education is secular, free, compulsory, and based on three levels [247] [248] The academic year is apportioned into two semesters, beginning in September or October and ending in June or July Albanian is the primary language of instruction in the country's academic institutions [248] The study of a first foreign language is mandatory and taught most often at elementary and bilingual schools [249] Languages taught in schools are English, Italian, French and German [249] Albania has a school life expectancy of 16 years and a literacy rate of 98.7%, with 99.2% for men and 98.3% for women [250] [251]\n\n\nEducation\nIn Albania, education

Languages taught in schools are English, Italian, French and German [249] Albania has a school life expectancy of 16 years and a literacy rate of 98.7%, with 99.2% for men and 98.3% for women [250] [251]\n\n\nHealth\nThe constitution of Albania guarantees its citizens equal, free, and universal health care [254] The health care system is organized into primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare, and is in a process of modernization and development [255] [256] The life expectancy at birth in Albania is 77.8 years, ranking 37th in the world and surpassing several developed countries [257] The average healthy life expectancy is 68.8 years, ranking 37th in the world [258] The country's infant mortality rate was estimated at 12 per 1,000 live births in 2015 In 2000, the country had the world's 55th-best healthcare performance, as defined by the World Health Organization [259]\n\n\nEnergy\nDue to its location and natural resources, Albania has a wide variety of energy resources, ranging from gas, oil, and coal to wind, solar, water, and other renewable sources [264] [265] According to the World Economic Forum's 2023 Energy Transition Index (ETI), the country ranked 21st globally, highlighting the progress in its energy transition agenda [266] Currently, Albania's electricity generation sector depends on hydroelectricity, ranking fifth in the world in percentage terms [267] [268] [269] The Drin, in the north, hosts four hydroelectric power stations, including Fierza, Koman, Skavica and Vau i Dejës Two other power stations, such as the Banjë and Moglicë, are along the Devoll in the south [270]\n\n\nMedia\nThe freedom of press and speech, and the right to free expression is guaranteed in the constitution of Albania [277] Albania was ranked 84th on the Press Freedom Index of 2020 compiled by the Reporters Without Borders, with its score steadily declining since 2003 [278] Nevertheless, in the 2020 report of Freedom in the World, the Freedom House classified the freedoms of press and speech in Albania as partly free from political interference and manipulation [279]\n\n\nTechnology\nAfter the fall of communism in 1991, human resources in sciences and technology in Albania have drastically decreased As of various reports, during 1991 to 2005 approximately 50% of the professors and scientists of the universities and science institutions in the country have left Albania [282] In 2009, the government approved the National Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation in Albania covering the period 2009 to 2015 [283] It aims to triple public spending on research and development to 0.6% of GDP and augment the share of GDE from foreign sources, including the framework programmes for research of the European Union, to the point where it covers 40% of research spending, among others Albania was ranked 84th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024 [284]\n\n\nDemography\nThe demographic statistics of Albania, as revealed by the 2023 census conducted by the Instituti i Statistikave (INSTAT), indicated a population of 2,402,113, with a notable decline from the 2,821,977 recorded in the 2011 census [3] [295] The decrease in inhabitants began after the disintegration of the communist regime in Albania and is associated with significant shifts within the political, economic, and social structure of Albania [296] [297] A principal factor in this transition incorporates a decline in fertility rates coupled with an increase in emigration, both contributing to persistent demographic changes and challenges [298] It is forecast that the population will continue shrinking for the next decade at least, depending on the actual rates and the level of migration [299] Currently, the population density of Albania is measured at 83.6 inhabitants per square kilometer with a varied distribution of inhabitants across different regions [3] [300] The counties of Tirana and Durrës showcase substantial concentrations of people, accounting for about 41% of the overall demographic of Albania, with 32% residing in Tirana and 9% in Durrës [301] Conversely, more peripheral and rural counties such as Gjirokastër and Kukës present significantly lower population densities, with each aiding 3% to the overall population [301]\n\n\nUrbanisation\nSubsequent to the collapse of communism in 1991, Albania has undergone a remarkable transformation in its urban landscape, emerging as one of the fastest urbanising countries in Europe [306] [307] [308] At the forefront of this transformation is the Tirana-Durrës agglomeration, a densely populated urban corridor situated along the western coast of Albania [309] This corridor has become the primary locus of population growth and settlement development, attracting a significant influx of internal migrants from the country's peripheral areas [309] Despite an overall decline of the country's total population, the proportion of the urban demographic has consistently progressed from 47% in 2001 to 65% in 2023 [297] [310] [311] This sustained increase, coupled with the concentration in the Tirana-Durrës region, has led to a spread of regional imbalances, with the peripheral areas, particularly Dibër and Kukës, experiencing severe depopulation [312] [313] [301]\n\n\nLanguage\nThe official language of the country is Albanian which is spoken by the vast majority of the country's population [325] Its standard spoken and written form is revised and merged from the two main dialects, Gheg and Tosk, though it is notably based more on the Tosk dialect The Shkumbin river is the rough dividing line between the two dialects Among minority languages, Greek is the second most-spoken language in the country, with 0.5 to 3% of the population speaking it as first language, mainly in the country's south where its speakers are concentrated [326] [327] [328] [329] Other languages spoken by ethnic minorities in Albania include Aromanian, Serbian, Macedonian, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Gorani, and Roma [330] Macedonian is official in the Pustec Municipality in East Albania According to the 2011 population census, 2,765,610 or 98.8% of the population declared Albanian as their mother tongue [331] Because of large migration flows from Albania, over half of Albanians during their life learn a second language The main foreign language known is English with 40.0%, followed by Italian with 27.8% and Greek with 22.9% The English speakers were mostly young people, the knowledge of Italian is stable in every age group, while there is a decrease of the speakers of Greek in the youngest group [332]\n\n\nMinorities\nDesignated national and cultural minorities in Albania include Aromanian, Greek, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Serb, Roma], Egyptian, Bosnian and Bulgarian peoples, as well as Gorani and Jews as other minority groups [336] [337] The 2023 census recorded the ethnic composition as Albanians 2,186,917 (91,04% of the total), Greeks 23,485 (0,98%), Macedonians 2,281 (0,09%), Montenegrins 511 (0,02%), Aromanians 2,459 (0,1%), Roma 9,813 (0.4%), Balkan Egyptians 12,375 (0,5%), Bosnians 2,963 (0,12%), Serbians 584 (0,02%), Bulgarians 7,057 (0,29%), mixed ethnicities 770 (0.03%), other ethnicities 3,798 (0.15%), and 134,451 (5.60%) with unspecified ethnicity, out of a total population of 2,402,113 [338]\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in Albania as of the 2023 census conducted by the Instituti i Statistikës (INSTAT) [1]\n\n\nCulture\nThe red and black national colours are displayed on the flag of Albania that is adorned with a double-headed eagle as the foremost recognised national symbol of Albania [361] [362] [363] With the black eagle portraying bravery and strength, the red field symbolises the fortitude and sacrifices of the Albanian people [361] The eagle is linked with the legacy of the national hero Gjergj Kastrioti, renowned as Skanderbeg, who led a prosperous resistance movement against Ottoman rule [364] [365] [363] Rooted in the Middle Ages, it emerged as a heraldic symbol in the Principality of Arbër and among notable Albanian dynasties such as the Dukagjini, Kastrioti, Muzaka and Thopia clans [366] Amid the Albanian Renaissance, marking the resurgence of Albanian national identity and aspirations for independence, the Albanian eagle regained its prominence [362] Its importance reached its culmination with Albania's declaration of independence in 1912, when Ismail Qemali raised it as the national flag in Vlorë [362]\n\n\nSymbols\nThe red and

[362]\n\n\nClothing\nAlbanian traditional clothing, with its contrasting variations for the northern Gheg and southern Tosk Albanians, is a testament to Albania's history, cultural diversity and ethnic identity [367] Gheg men wear a light-colored shirt paired with wide loose-fitting trousers referred to as the Tirq These trousers are securely fastened by a wide woven belt, the Brez An integral component of their costume is the Xhamadan, a woolen red velvet vest adorned with folkloric motifs and gold patterns [368] They also wear a distinctive dome-shaped hat known as the Qeleshe, crafted from wool, with its origins tracing back to the Illyrians [369] [370] Conversely, Tosk men opt for the Fustanella, a knee-length garment designated as the national costume, typically white with pleats, accompanied by a white shirt They also wear a beige or dark blue Xhamadan reminiscent of the Gheg attire To complete their attire, men wear knee-high socks referred to as Çorape and leather shoes known as Opinga.\n\n\nArt and architecture\nThe artistic history of Albania has been particularly influenced by a multitude of ancient and medieval people, traditions and religions It covers a broad spectrum with mediums and disciplines that include painting, pottery, sculpture, ceramics and architecture all of them exemplifying a great variety in style and shape, in different regions and period.\n\n\nCuisine\nThroughout the centuries, Albanian cuisine has been widely influenced by Albanian culture, geography and history, and as such, different parts of the country enjoy specific regional cuisines Cooking traditions especially vary between the north and the south, owing to differing topography and climate that essentially contribute to the excellent growth conditions for a wide array of herbs, fruits, and vegetables [377]\n\n\nMusic\nAlbanian folk music is a prominent part of the national identity, and continues to play a major part in overall Albanian music Folk music can be divided into two stylistic groups, mainly the northern Gheg varieties, and southern Lab and Tosk varieties Northern and southern traditions are contrasted by a rugged tone from the north, and the more relaxed southern form of music.\n\n\nLiterature\nThe cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition, when cleric Gjon Buzuku translated the Catholic liturgy into Albanian, trying to do for Albanian what Martin Luther had done for German Meshari (The Missal) written by Gjon Buzuku was published in 1555 and is considered one of the first literary work of written Albanian during the Middle Ages The refined level of the language and the stabilised orthography must be the result of an earlier tradition of written Albanian, a tradition that is not well understood However, there is some fragmented evidence, pre-dating Buzuku, which indicates that Albanian was written from at least the 14th century.\n\n\nSports\nAlbania participated at the Olympic Games in 1972 for the first time The country made their Winter Olympic Games debut in 2006 Albania missed the next four games, two of them due to the 1980 and 1984 boycotts, but returned for the 1992 games in Barcelona Since then, Albania have participated in all games Albania normally competes in events that include swimming, athletics, weightlifting, shooting and wrestling The country have been represented by the National Olympic Committee of Albania since 1972 The nation has participated at the Mediterranean Games since the games of 1987 in Syria The Albanian athletes have won a total of 43 (8 gold, 17 silver and 18 bronze) medals from 1987 to 2013.\n\n\nHuman rights\nNearly 60% of women in rural areas suffer physical or psychological violence and nearly 8% are victims of sexual violence \nProtection orders are often violated.\nIn 2014 the Albanian Helsinki Committee (AHC) reported that the number of female murder victims is still high [389] The Commissioner for Protection from Discrimination has raised concerns regarding the family registration law that discriminates against women As a result, heads of households, who are overwhelmingly men, have the right to change family residency without their partners' permission [389]\n\n\nSee also\n Wikimedia Atlas of Albania\n\n\nNotes\n Wikimedia Atlas of Albania\n\n\nReferences\n Wikimedia Atlas of Albania\n\n\nSources\n Wikimedia Atlas of

Albania, is a country located in Southeastern Europe, bordering the Adriatic Sea to the west, Montenegro to the northwest, Kosovo to the northeast, North Macedonia to the east, Greece to the south, and the Ionian Sea to the southwest. With a total area of 28,748 square kilometers (11,100 square miles), Albania is the 143rd largest country in the world by land area.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe historical origins of the term \"Albania\" can be traced back to medieval Latin, with its foundations believed to be associated with the Illyrian tribe of the Albani. This connection gains further support from the work of the Ancient Greek geographer Ptolemy during the 2nd century AD, where he included the settlement of Albanopolis situated to the northeast of Durrës. The presence of a medieval settlement named Albanon or Arbanon hints at the possibility of historical continuity.\n\n**History**\n\n**Mesolithic habitation in Albania** has been evidenced in several open-air sites which during that period were close to the Adriatic coastline and in cave sites. Mesolithic objects found in a cave near Xarrë include flint and jasper objects along with fossilized animal bones, while those discoveries at Mount Dajt comprise bone and stone tools similar to those of the Aurignacian culture.\n\nThe **Neolithic era in Albania** began around 7000 BC and is evidenced in finds which indicate domestication of sheep and goats and small-scale agriculture.

From the 6th century into the 7th century, the Slavs crossed the Danube and largely absorbed the indigenous Greeks, Illyrians, and Thracians in the Balkans; thus, the Illyrians were mentioned for the last time in historical records in the 7th century.\n\n**Ottoman Empire**\n\nWith the fall of Constantinople, the Ottoman Empire continued an extended period of conquest and expansion with its borders going deep into Southeast Europe. They reached the Albanian Ionian Sea Coast in 1385 and erected their garrisons across Southern Albania in 1415 and then occupied most of Albania in 1431.\n\n**Rilindja**\n\nThe Albanian Renaissance was a period with its roots in the late 18th century and continuing into the 19th century, during which the Albanian people gathered spiritual and intellectual strength for an independent cultural and political life within an independent nation. Modern Albanian culture flourished too, especially Albanian literature and arts, and was frequently linked to the influences of the Romanticism and Enlightenment principles.\n\n**Independence**\n\nAlbania declared independence from the Ottoman Empire on 28 November 1912, accompanied by the establishment of the Senate and Government by the Assembly of Vlorë on 4 December 1912. Its sovereignty was recognized by the Conference of London.\n\n**First Republic**\n\nThe interwar period in Albania was marked by persistent economic and social difficulties, political instability, and foreign interventions. After World War I, Albania lacked an established government and internationally recognized borders, rendering it vulnerable to neighboring entities such as Greece, Italy, and Yugoslavia, all of which sought to expand their influence.\n\n**Communism**\n\nThe establishment of the People's Republic of Albania under the leadership of Enver Hoxha was a significant epoch in modern Albanian history. Hoxha's regime embraced Marxist-Leninist ideologies and implemented authoritarian policies, including prohibition of religious practices, severe restrictions on travel, and abolition of private property rights.\n\n**Fourth Republic**\n\nAfter four decades of communism, Albania transitioned into a sovereign parliamentary constitutional republic. The country has maintained a democratic order and has been actively involved in international affairs, advocating for Euro-Atlantic integration and protection of the rights of the Albanian diaspora.\n\n**Politics**\n\nThe Albanian government operates under a constitution that serves as the principal document of the country. The constitution is grounded in the principle of the separation of powers, with three arms of government that encompass the legislative, executive, and judiciary.\n\n**Foreign relations**\n\nThe Albanian government has adopted a foreign policy orientation centered on active cooperation and engagement in international affairs. The country is a member of various international organizations, including the United Nations, NATO, and the European Union.\n\n**Economy**\n\nThe Albanian economy has undergone significant changes since the collapse of communism in 1991.

Sicily, whereby others sought protection at the often inaccessible Mountains of Albania [56] [57] The Albanians, as Christians, were considered an inferior class of people, and as such they were subjected to heavy taxes among others by the Devshirme system that allowed the Sultan to collect a requisite percentage of Christian adolescents from their families to compose the Janissary [58] The Ottoman conquest was also accompanied with the gradual process of Islamisation and the rapid construction of mosques.\n\n\nRilindja\nThe Albanian Renaissance was a period with its roots in the late

London On 29 July 1913, the Treaty of London delineated the borders of the country and its neighbors, leaving many Albanians outside Albania, predominantly partitioned between Montenegro, Serbia, and Greece [78]\n\n\nFirst Republic\nThe interwar period in Albania was marked by persistent economic and social difficulties, political instability and foreign interventions [91] [92] After World War I, Albania lacked an established government and internationally recognized borders, rendering it vulnerable to neighboring entities such as Greece, Italy, and Yugoslavia, all of which sought to expand their influence [91] This led to political uncertainty, highlighted in 1918 when the Congress of Durrës sought Paris Peace Conference protection but was denied, further complicating Albania's position on the international stage Territorial tensions escalated as Yugoslavia, particularly Serbia, sought control of northern Albania, while Greece aimed dominance in southern Albania The situation deteriorated in 1919 when the Serbs launched attacks on Albanian inhabitants, among others in Gusinje and Plav, resulting in massacres and large-scale displacement [91] [93] [94] Meanwhile, Italian influence continued to expand during this time, driven by economic interests and political ambitions [92] [95]\n\n\nCommunism\nThe establishment of the People's Republic of Albania under the leadership of Enver Hoxha was a significant epoch in modern Albanian history [101] Hoxha's regime embraced Marxist–Leninist ideologies and implemented authoritarian policies, including prohibition of religious practices, severe restrictions on travel, and abolition of private property rights [102] It was also defined by a persistent pattern of purges, extensive repression, instances of betrayal, and hostility to external influences [102] Any form of opposition or resistance to his rule was met with expeditious and severe consequences, such as internal exile, extended imprisonment, and execution [102] The regime confronted a multitude of challenges, including widespread poverty, illiteracy, health crises and gender inequality [100] In response, Hoxha initiated a modernization initiative aimed at attaining economic and social liberation and transforming Albania into an industrial society [100] The regime placed a high priority on the diversification of the economy through Soviet-style industrialization, comprehensive infrastructure development such as the introduction of a transformative railway system, expansion of education and healthcare services, elimination of adult illiteracy, and targeted advancements in areas such as women's rights [103] [104] [105] [106]\n\n\nFourth Republic\nAfter four decades of communism paired with the revolutions of 1989, Albania witnessed a notable rise in political activism, particularly among students, which led to a transformation in the prevailing order After the first multi-party elections of 1991, the communist party maintained a stronghold in the parliament until its defeat in the parliamentary elections of 1992 directed by the Democratic Party [109] Considerable economic and financial resources were devoted to pyramid schemes that were widely supported by the government The schemes swept up somewhere between one sixth and one third of the population of the country [110] [111] Despite the International Monetary Fund's warnings, Sali Berisha defended the schemes as large investment firms, leading more people to redirect their remittances and sell their homes and cattle for cash to deposit in the schemes [112]\n\n\nContemporary\nAfter its communist system disintegrated, Albania embarked on an active path toward Westernization with the ambition to obtain membership in the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) [115] A notable milestone was reached in 2009, when the country attained membership in NATO, marking a pioneering achievement among the nations of Southeast Europe [116] [117] In adherence to its vision for further integration into the EU, it formally applied for membership on 28 April 2009 [118] Another milestone was reached on 24 June 2014, when the country was granted official candidate status [119]\n\n\nEnvironment\nAlbania lies along the Mediterranean Sea on the Balkan Peninsula in South and Southeast Europe, and has an area of 28,748 km2 (11,100 sq mi) [135] It is bordered by the Adriatic Sea to the west, Montenegro to the northwest, Kosovo to the northeast, North Macedonia to the east, Greece to the south, and the Ionian Sea to the southwest It is between latitudes 42° and 39° N and longitudes 21° and 19° E Geographic coordinates include Vërmosh at 42° 35' 34\" northern latitude as the northernmost point, Konispol at 39° 40' 0\" northern latitude as the southernmost, Sazan at 19° 16' 50\" eastern longitude as the westernmost, and Vërnik at 21° 1' 26\" eastern longitude as the easternmost [136] Mount Korab, rising at 2,764 m (9,068.24 ft) above the Adriatic, is the highest point, while the Mediterranean Sea, at 0 m (0.00 ft), is the lowest The country extends 148 km (92 mi) from east to west and around 340 km (211 mi) from north to south.\n\n\nGeography\nAlbania lies along the Mediterranean Sea on the Balkan Peninsula in South and Southeast Europe, and has an area of 28,748 km2 (11,100 sq mi) [135] It is bordered by the Adriatic Sea to the west, Montenegro to the northwest, Kosovo to the northeast, North Macedonia to the east, Greece to the south, and the Ionian Sea to the southwest It is between

south.\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate of Albania exhibits a distinguished level of variability and diversity due to the differences in latitude, longitude and altitude [141] [142] Albania experiences a Mediterranean and Continental climate, characterised by the presence of four distinct seasons [143] According to the Köppen classification, Albania encompasses five primary climatic types, spanning from Mediterranean and subtropical in the western half to oceanic, continental and subarctic in the eastern half of the country [144] The coastal regions along the Adriatic and Ionian Seas in Albania are acknowledged as the warmest areas, while the northern and eastern regions encompassing the Albanian Alps and the Korab Mountains are recognised as the coldest areas in the country [145] Throughout the year, the average monthly temperatures fluctuate, ranging from −1 °C (30 °F) during the winter months to 21.8 °C (71.2 °F) in the summer months Notably, the highest recorded temperature of 43.9 °C (111.0 °F) was observed in Kuçovë on 18 July 1973, while the lowest temperature of −29 °C (−20 °F) was recorded in Shtyllë, Librazhd on 9 January 2017 [146] [147]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nA biodiversity hotspot, Albania possesses an exceptionally rich and contrasting biodiversity on account of its geographical location at the centre of the Mediterranean Sea and the great diversity in its climatic, geological and hydrological conditions [149] [150] Because of remoteness, the mountains and hills of Albania are endowed with forests, trees and grasses that are essential to the lives for a wide variety of animals, among others for two of the most endangered species of the country, the lynx and brown bear, as well as the wildcat, grey wolf, red fox, golden jackal, Egyptian vulture and golden eagle, the latter constituting the national animal of the country [151] [152] [153] [154]\n\n\nConservation\nAlbania has been an active participant in numerous international agreements and conventions aimed at strengthing its commitment to the preservation and sustainable management of biological diversity Since 1994, the country is a party to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and its associated Cartagena and Nagoya Protocols [159] To uphold these commitments, it has developed and implemented a comprehensive National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) [159] Furthermore, Albania has established a partnership with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), advancing its conservation efforts on both national and international scales Guided by the IUCN, the country has made substantial progress in the foundation of protected areas within its boundaries, encompassing 12 national parks among others Butrint, Karaburun-Sazan, Llogara, Prespa and Vjosa [160]\n\n\nProtected areas\nThe protected areas of Albania are areas designated and managed by the Albanian government There are 12 national parks, 4 ramsar sites, 1 biosphere reserve and 786 other types of conservation reserves in Albania [160] [165] Located in the north, the Albanian Alps National Park, comprising the former Theth National Park and Valbonë Valley National Park, is surrounded amidst the towering peaks of the Albanian Alps In the east, portions of the rugged Korab, Nemërçka and Shebenik Mountains are conserved within the boundaries of Fir of Hotovë-Dangëlli National Park, Shebenik National Park and Prespa National Park, with the latter encompassing Albania's share of the Great and Small Lakes of Prespa.\n\n\nEnvironmental issues\nEnvironmental issues in Albania notably encompass air and water pollution, climate change impacts, waste management shortcomings, biodiversity loss and imperative for nature conservation [166] [167] Climate change is predicted to exert significant impacts on the quality of life in Albania [168] The country is recognised as vulnerable to climate change impacts, ranked 79 among 181 countries in the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index of 2020 [169] Factors that account for the country's vulnerability to climate change risks include geological and hydrological hazards, including earthquakes, flooding, fires, landslides, torrential rains, river and coastal erosion [170] [171]\n\n\nPolitics\nSince declaring independence in 1912, Albania has experienced a significant political transformation, traversing through distinct periods that included a monarchical rule, a communist regime and the eventual establishment of a democratic order [176] In 1998, Albania transitioned into a sovereign parliamentary constitutional republic, marking a fundamental milestone in its political evolution [177] Its governance structure operates under a constitution that serves as the principal document of the country [178] The constitution is grounded in the principle of the separation of powers, with three arms of government that encompass the legislative embodied in the Parliament, the executive led by the President as the ceremonial head of state and the Prime Minister as the functional head of government, and the judiciary with a hierarchy of courts, including the constitutional and supreme courts as well as multiple appeal and administrative courts [177]\n\n\nForeign relations\nEmerging from decades of isolation during the communism, Albania has adopted a foreign policy orientation centered on active cooperation and engagement in international affairs At the core of Albania's foreign policies lie a set of objectives, which encompass the commitment to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity, the cultivation of diplomatic ties with other countries, advocating for international recognition of Kosovo, addressing the concerns related to the expulsion of Cham Albanians, pursuing Euro-Atlantic integration and protecting the rights of the Albanians in Kosovo, Greece, Italy, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and the diaspora [182]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Albanian Armed Forces consist of Land, Air and Naval Forces and constitute the military and paramilitary forces of the country They are led by a commander-in-chief under the supervision of the Ministry of Defence and by the President as the supreme commander during wartime However, in times of peace its powers are executed through the Prime Minister and the Defence Minister [189]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nAlbania is defined within a territorial area of 28,748 km2 (11,100 sq mi) in the Balkan Peninsula It is informally divided into three regions, the Northern, Central and Southern Regions Since its Declaration of Independence in 1912, Albania has reformed its internal organization 21 times Presently, the primary administrative units are the twelve constituent counties (qarqe/qarqet), which hold equal status under the law [198] Counties had previously been used in the 1950s and were recreated on 31 July 2000 to unify the 36 districts (rrathë/rrathët) of that time [199] [200] The largest county in Albania by population is Tirana County with over 800,000 people The smallest county, by population, is Gjirokastër County with over 70,000 people The largest county, by area, is Korçë County encompassing 3,711 square kilometres (1,433 sq mi) of the southeast of Albania The smallest county, by area, is Durrës County with an area of 766 square kilometres (296 sq mi) in the west of Albania.\n\n\nEconomy\nAlbania's transition from a socialist planned economy to a capitalist mixed economy has been largely successful [209] The country has a developing mixed economy classified by the World Bank as an upper-middle income economy In 2016, it had the fourth-lowest unemployment rate in the Balkans with an estimated value of 14.7% Its largest trading partners are Italy, Greece, China, Spain, Kosovo and the United States The lek (ALL) is the country's currency and is pegged at approximately 132.51 lek per euro.\n\n\nPrimary sector\nAgriculture in the country is based on small to medium-sized family-owned dispersed units It remains a significant sector of the economy of Albania It employs 41% [216] of the population, and about 24.31% of the land is used for agricultural purposes One of the earliest farming sites in Europe has been found in the southeast of the country [217] As part of the pre-accession process of Albania to the European Union, farmers are being aided through IPA funds to improve Albanian agriculture standards [218]\n\n\nSecondary sector\nAlbania's secondary sector has undergone many changes and diversification since the communist regime collapsed It is very diversified, from electronics, manufacturing, [223] textiles, to food, cement, mining, [224] and energy The Antea Cement plant in Fushë-Krujë is considered one of the nation's largest industrial greenfield investments [225] Albanian oil and gas is one of the most promising, albeit strictly regulated, sectors of its economy Albania has the second-largest oil deposits in the Balkan peninsula after Romania, and the largest oil reserves [226] in Europe The Albpetrol company is owned by the Albanian state and monitors the state petroleum agreements in the country The textile industry has seen an extensive expansion by approaching companies from the European Union (EU) in Albania According to the Instituti i Statistikës (INSTAT), as of 2016 [update], textile production had an annual growth of 5.3% and an annual turnover of around 1.5 billion euros [227]\n\n\nTertiary sector\nThe tertiary sector represents the fastest growing sector of the country's economy 36% of the population work in the service sector which contributes to 65% of the country's GDP [230] Ever since the end of the 20th century, the banking industry is a major component of the tertiary sector and remains in good conditions overall due to privatisation and the commendable monetary policy [231] [230]\n\n\nTransport\nTransportation in Albania is managed within the functions of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy and entities such as the Albanian Road Authority (ARRSH), responsible for the construction and maintenance of the highways and motorways in Albania, as well as the Albanian Aviation Authority (AAC), with the responsibility of coordinating civil aviation and airports in the country.\n\n\nInfrastructure\nIn Albania, education is secular, free, compulsory, and based on three levels [247] [248] The academic year is apportioned into two semesters, beginning in September or October and ending in June or July Albanian is the primary language of instruction in the country's academic institutions [248] The study of a first foreign language is mandatory and taught most often at elementary and bilingual schools [249] Languages taught in schools are English, Italian, French and German [249] Albania has a school life expectancy of 16 years and a literacy rate of 98.7%, with 99.2% for men and 98.3% for women [250] [251]\n\n\nEducation\nIn Albania, education is secular, free, compulsory, and based on three levels [247] [248] The academic year is apportioned into two semesters, beginning in September or October and ending in June or July Albanian is the primary language of instruction in the country's academic institutions [248] The study of a first foreign language is mandatory and taught most often at elementary and bilingual schools [249] Languages taught in schools are English, Italian, French and German [249] Albania has a school life expectancy of 16 years and a literacy rate of 98.7%, with 99.2% for men and 98.3% for women [250] [251]\n\n\nHealth\nThe constitution of Albania guarantees its citizens equal, free, and universal health care [254] The health care system is organized into primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare, and is in a process of modernization and development [255] [256] The life expectancy at birth in Albania is 77.8 years, ranking 37th in the world and surpassing several developed countries [257] The average healthy life expectancy is 68.8 years, ranking 37th in the world [258] The country's infant mortality rate was estimated at 12 per 1,000 live births in 2015 In 2000, the country had the world's 55th-best healthcare performance, as defined by the World Health Organization [259]\n\n\nEnergy\nDue to its location and natural resources, Albania has a wide variety of energy resources, ranging from gas, oil, and coal to wind, solar, water, and other renewable sources [264] [265] According to the World Economic Forum's 2023 Energy Transition Index (ETI), the country ranked 21st globally, highlighting the progress in its energy transition agenda [266] Currently, Albania's electricity generation sector depends on hydroelectricity, ranking fifth in the world in percentage terms [267] [268] [269] The Drin, in the north, hosts four hydroelectric power stations, including Fierza, Koman, Skavica and Vau i Dejës Two other power stations, such as the Banjë and Moglicë, are along the Devoll in the south [270]\n\n\nMedia\nThe freedom of press and speech, and the right to free expression is guaranteed in the constitution of Albania [277] Albania was ranked 84th on the Press Freedom Index of 2020 compiled by the Reporters Without Borders, with its score steadily declining since 2003 [278] Nevertheless, in the 2020 report of Freedom in the World, the Freedom House classified the freedoms of press and speech in Albania as partly free from political interference and manipulation [279]\n\n\nTechnology\nAfter the fall of communism in 1991, human resources in sciences and technology in Albania have drastically decreased As of various reports, during 1991 to 2005 approximately 50% of the professors and scientists of the universities and science institutions in the country have left Albania [282] In 2009, the government approved the National Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation in Albania covering the period 2009 to 2015 [283] It aims to triple public spending on research and development to 0.6% of GDP and augment the share of GDE from foreign sources, including the framework programmes for research of the European Union, to the point where it covers 40% of research spending, among others Albania was ranked 84th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024 [284]\n\n\nDemography\nThe demographic statistics of Albania, as revealed by the 2023 census conducted by the Instituti i Statistikave (INSTAT), indicated a population of 2,402,113, with a notable decline from the 2,821,977 recorded in the 2011 census [3] [295] The decrease in inhabitants began after the disintegration of the communist regime in Albania and is associated with significant shifts within the political, economic, and social structure of Albania [296] [297] A principal factor in this transition incorporates a decline in fertility rates coupled with an increase in emigration, both contributing to persistent demographic changes and challenges [298] It is forecast that the population will continue shrinking for the next decade at least, depending on the actual rates and the level of migration [299] Currently, the population density of Albania is measured at 83.6 inhabitants per square kilometer with a varied distribution of inhabitants across different regions [3] [300] The counties of Tirana and Durrës showcase substantial concentrations of people, accounting for about 41% of the overall demographic of Albania, with 32% residing in Tirana and 9% in Durrës [301] Conversely, more peripheral and rural counties such as Gjirokastër and Kukës present significantly lower population densities, with each aiding 3% to the overall population [301]\n\n\nUrbanisation\nSubsequent to the collapse of communism in 1991, Albania has undergone a remarkable transformation in its urban landscape, emerging as one of the fastest urbanising countries in Europe [306] [307] [308] At the forefront of this transformation is the Tirana-Durrës agglomeration, a densely populated urban corridor situated along the western coast of Albania [309] This corridor has become the primary locus of population growth and settlement development, attracting a significant influx of internal migrants from the country's peripheral areas [309] Despite an overall decline of the country's total population, the proportion of the urban demographic has consistently progressed from 47% in 2001 to 65% in 2023 [297] [310] [311] This sustained increase, coupled with the concentration in the Tirana-Durrës region, has led to a spread of regional imbalances, with the peripheral areas, particularly Dibër and Kukës, experiencing severe depopulation [312] [313] [301]\n\n\nLanguage\nThe official language of the country is Albanian which is spoken by the vast majority of the country's population [325] Its standard spoken and written form is revised and merged from the two main dialects, Gheg and Tosk, though it is notably based more on the Tosk dialect The Shkumbin river is the rough dividing line between the two dialects Among minority languages, Greek is the second most-spoken language in the country, with 0.5 to 3% of the population speaking it as first language, mainly in the country's south where its speakers are concentrated [326] [327] [328] [329] Other languages spoken by ethnic minorities in Albania include Aromanian, Serbian, Macedonian, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Gorani, and Roma [330] Macedonian is official in the Pustec Municipality in East Albania According to the 2011 population census, 2,765,610 or 98.8% of the population declared Albanian as their mother tongue [331] Because of large migration flows from Albania, over half of Albanians during their life learn a second language The main foreign language known is English with 40.0%, followed by Italian with 27.8% and Greek with 22.9% The English speakers were mostly young people, the knowledge of Italian is stable in every age group, while there is a decrease of the speakers of Greek in the youngest group [332]\n\n\nMinorities\nDesignated national and cultural minorities in Albania include Aromanian, Greek, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Serb, Roma], Egyptian, Bosnian and Bulgarian peoples, as well as Gorani and Jews as other minority groups [336] [337] The 2023 census recorded the ethnic composition as Albanians 2,186,917 (91,04% of the total), Greeks 23,485 (0,98%), Macedonians 2,281 (0,09%), Montenegrins 511 (0,02%), Aromanians 2,459 (0,1%), Roma 9,813 (0.4%), Balkan Egyptians 12,375 (0,5%), Bosnians 2,963 (0,12%), Serbians 584 (0,02%), Bulgarians 7,057 (0,29%), mixed ethnicities 770 (0.03%), other ethnicities 3,798 (0.15%), and 134,451 (5.60%) with unspecified ethnicity, out of a total population of 2,402,113 [338]\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in Albania as of the 2023 census conducted by the Instituti i Statistikës (INSTAT) [1]\n\n\nCulture\nThe red and black national colours are displayed on the flag of Albania that is adorned with a double-headed eagle as the foremost recognised national symbol of Albania [361] [362] [363] With the black eagle portraying bravery and strength, the red field symbolises the fortitude and sacrifices of the Albanian people [361] The eagle is linked with the legacy of the national hero Gjergj Kastrioti, renowned as Skanderbeg, who led a prosperous resistance movement against Ottoman rule [364] [365] [363] Rooted in the Middle Ages, it emerged as a heraldic symbol in the Principality of Arbër and among notable Albanian dynasties such as the Dukagjini, Kastrioti, Muzaka and Thopia clans [366] Amid the Albanian Renaissance, marking the resurgence of Albanian national identity and aspirations for independence, the Albanian eagle regained its prominence [362] Its importance reached its culmination with Albania's declaration of independence in 1912, when Ismail Qemali raised it as the national flag in Vlorë [362]\n\n\nSymbols\nThe red and black national colours are displayed on the flag of Albania that is adorned with a double-headed eagle as the foremost recognised national symbol of Albania [361] [362] [363] With the black eagle

the Albanian eagle regained its prominence [362] Its importance reached its culmination with Albania's declaration of independence in 1912, when Ismail Qemali raised it as the national flag in Vlorë [362]\n\n\nClothing\nAlbanian traditional clothing, with its contrasting variations for the northern Gheg and southern Tosk Albanians, is a testament to Albania's history, cultural diversity and ethnic identity [367] Gheg men wear a light-colored shirt paired with wide loose-fitting trousers referred to as the Tirq These trousers are securely fastened by a wide woven belt, the Brez An integral component of their costume is the Xhamadan, a woolen red velvet vest adorned with folkloric motifs and gold patterns [368] They also wear a distinctive dome-shaped hat known as the Qeleshe, crafted from wool, with its origins tracing back to the Illyrians [369] [370] Conversely, Tosk men opt for the Fustanella, a knee-length garment designated as the national costume, typically white with pleats, accompanied by a white shirt They also wear a beige or dark blue Xhamadan reminiscent of the Gheg attire To complete their attire, men wear knee-high socks referred to as Çorape and leather shoes known as Opinga.\n\n\nArt and architecture\nThe artistic history of Albania has been particularly influenced by a multitude of ancient and medieval people, traditions and religions It covers a broad spectrum with mediums and disciplines that include painting, pottery, sculpture, ceramics and architecture all of them exemplifying a great variety in style and shape, in different regions and period.\n\n\nCuisine\nThroughout the centuries, Albanian cuisine has been widely influenced by Albanian culture, geography and history, and as such, different parts of the country enjoy specific regional cuisines Cooking traditions especially vary between the north and the south, owing to differing topography and climate that essentially contribute to the excellent growth conditions for a wide array of herbs, fruits, and vegetables [377]\n\n\nMusic\nAlbanian folk music is a prominent part of the national identity, and continues to play a major part in overall Albanian music Folk music can be divided into two stylistic groups, mainly the northern Gheg varieties, and southern Lab and Tosk varieties Northern and southern traditions are contrasted by a rugged tone from the north, and the more relaxed southern form of music.\n\n\nLiterature\nThe cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition, when cleric Gjon Buzuku translated the Catholic liturgy into Albanian, trying to do for Albanian what Martin Luther had done for German Meshari (The Missal) written by Gjon Buzuku was published in 1555 and is considered one of the first literary work of written Albanian during the Middle Ages The refined level of the language and the stabilised orthography must be the result of an earlier tradition of written Albanian, a tradition that is not well understood However, there is some fragmented evidence, pre-dating Buzuku, which indicates that Albanian was written from at least the 14th century.\n\n\nSports\nAlbania participated at the Olympic Games in 1972 for the first time The country made their Winter Olympic Games debut in 2006 Albania missed the next four games, two of them due to the 1980 and 1984 boycotts, but returned for the 1992 games in Barcelona Since then, Albania have participated in all games Albania normally competes in events that include swimming, athletics, weightlifting, shooting and wrestling The country have been represented by the National Olympic Committee of Albania since 1972 The nation has participated at the Mediterranean Games since the games of 1987 in Syria The Albanian athletes have won a total of 43 (8 gold, 17 silver and 18 bronze) medals from 1987 to 2013.\n\n\nHuman rights\nNearly 60% of women in rural areas suffer physical or psychological violence and nearly 8% are victims of sexual violence \nProtection orders are often violated.\nIn 2014 the Albanian Helsinki Committee (AHC) reported that the number of female murder victims is still high [389] The Commissioner for Protection from Discrimination has raised concerns regarding the family registration law that discriminates against women As a result, heads of households, who are overwhelmingly men, have the right to change family residency without their partners' permission [389]\n\n\nSee also\n Wikimedia Atlas of Albania\n\n\nNotes\n Wikimedia Atlas of Albania\n\n\nReferences\n Wikimedia Atlas of Albania\n\n\nSources\n Wikimedia Atlas of

{"title": "Eggnog", "content": "\nTerminology\nThe Modern Bartender's Guide  from 1878 lists many variant names for the drink It distinguishes \"plain eggnog,\" \"egg milk punch,\" and \"milk punch\" from one another It also includes variants such as \"Baltimore eggnog,\" \"General Jackson eggnog,\" \"Imperial eggnog,\" two types of \"sherry cobbler eggnog,\" as well as \"sherry cobbler with egg,\" \"mulled claret with egg,\" \"egg sour,\" and \"Saratoga egg lemonade\" (also called \"sea breeze\") [4] [2] [3]\n\n\nHistory\nThe origins, etymology, and the ingredients used to make original eggnog drinks are debated.\n\n\nEtymology and origins\nThe origins, etymology, and the ingredients used to make original eggnog drinks are debated.\n\n\nDevelopment\nIn Britain, the drink was originally popular among the aristocracy [7] \"Milk, eggs, and sherry were foods of the wealthy, so eggnog was often used in toasts to prosperity and good health.\" [14] Those who could afford milk and eggs and costly spirits mixed the eggnog with brandy, Madeira wine or sherry to make a drink similar to modern alcoholic eggnog [7]\n\n\nIngredients and serving style\nTraditional homemade eggnog is made of milk or cream, sugar, raw eggs, one or more alcoholic spirits, and spices, often vanilla or nutmeg and in some recipes, cloves Some recipes call for the eggs to be separated so that the egg whites can be whipped until they are thick; this gives the drink a frothy texture  American food show presenter Alton Brown points out that based on its ingredients, eggnog is \"almost identical to ice cream It is technically just a stirred custard made of milk and egg\" [21]  Homemade recipes may use vanilla ice cream blended into the beverage, particularly when the goal is to create a chilled drink Some recipes call for condensed milk or evaporated milk in addition to milk and cream Acidophilus milk, a fermented milk product, has been used to make eggnog [22] While some recipes call for unwhipped heavy cream, in some recipes, whipped cream is added to the mixture, which gives it a frothier texture Various sweeteners are used, such as white sugar, brown sugar [23] and maple syrup [24]\n\n\nHomemade\nTraditional homemade eggnog is made of milk or cream, sugar, raw eggs, one or more alcoholic spirits, and spices, often vanilla or nutmeg and in some recipes, cloves Some recipes call for the eggs to be separated so that the egg whites can be whipped until they are thick;

one recipe calls for heating the mixture gently, without boiling, until it thickens enough to \"coat the back of a spoon.\" [36]\n\n\nRaw eggs\nMost homemade eggnog recipes have historically included raw eggs While the alcohol added to many homemade eggnogs is a bactericide, eggnog freshly made from raw eggs that are infected with salmonella and not heated can cause food poisoning A very small percentage of raw eggs are infected with salmonella [33] [failed verification] In 1981 most of the residents and staff of a nursing home in the U.S became ill with salmonellosis, and four died The cause was almost certainly an eggnog made on the spur of the moment, with some cases caused in a secondary outbreak caused by food being handled later by people with contaminated hands [34] A later publication of the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stated that the alcohol in eggnog is not sufficient to sterilize contaminated eggs [35] Using commercial pasteurized eggs or heating the milk-egg mixture sufficiently can make the drink safe; one recipe calls for heating the mixture gently, without boiling, until it thickens enough to \"coat the back of a spoon.\" [36]\n\n\nAlcohol content\nTIME magazine states that individuals should be aware of the alcohol content of eggnog, from a responsible drinking perspective When people make homemade alcoholic eggnog, or when they add spirits to commercially prepared eggnog, in some cases, the drink has a very high alcohol content; one columnist states that in his family Christmas tradition, \"it's not eggnog unless you can set fire to it\", due to high alcohol percentage [43] Jazz composer Charles Mingus had an eggnog recipe that contained enough alcohol, including 151 proof rum, to \"put down an elephant\" [44]\n\n\nNutritional aspects\nAccording to the USDA, a one cup (250 ml) serving of eggnog contains 343 kilocalories (1,440 kilojoules) (17% of a typical person's daily value of food energy); 34.4 grams of carbohydrates (11% of DV), including 21.4 grams of sugar; 19 grams of fat (29% of DV); and 9.7 grams of protein (19% of DV) [53] TIME magazine's Tristan Stephenson states that eggnog's \"alcohol and sugar provide energy, eggs supply protein, and the fat from the milk or cream gives the  [wintertime] drinker the necessary \"layers\" to deal with the frost.\" [54] TIME magazine also states that with its cream, eggs and sugar ingredients, \"eggnog can pack in upwards of 400  [kilocalories;

Its origins and etymology are debated, and its ingredients and preparation methods have varied over time and across different cultures. This article provides an overview of the history, ingredients, and characteristics of eggnog, as well as its commercial production, nutritional aspects, and reception.\n\n**Terminology**\n\nThe Modern Bartender's Guide from 1878 lists many variant names for the drink, distinguishing \"plain eggnog,\" \"egg milk punch,\" and \"milk punch\" from one another. It also includes variants such as \"Baltimore eggnog,\" \"General Jackson eggnog,\" \"Imperial eggnog,\" two types of \"sherry cobbler eggnog,\" as well as \"sherry cobbler with egg,\" \"mulled claret with egg,\" \"egg sour,\" and \"Saratoga egg lemonade\" (also called \"sea breeze\").\n\n**History**\n\nThe origins of eggnog are unclear, but it is believed to have originated in Europe in the 17th or 18th century. One theory suggests that it was brought to the Americas by European colonizers, where it became popular among the wealthy. The drink was often made with brandy, Madeira wine, or sherry, which were expensive and exclusive spirits at the time. In the United States, eggnog became a popular holiday beverage, often served at Christmas and other special occasions.\n\n**Etymology and Origins**\n\nThe etymology of the word \"eggnog\" is also unclear, but it is believed to come from the term \"egg and grog,\" which referred to a drink made with milk, eggs, and rum. Another theory suggests that the term \"eggnog\" comes from the term \"egg and nog,\" which referred to a drink made with milk, eggs, and beer.\n\n**Development**\n\nIn Britain, the drink was originally popular among the aristocracy. Milk, eggs, and sherry were foods of the wealthy, so eggnog was often used in toasts to prosperity and good health. Those who could afford milk and eggs and costly spirits mixed the eggnog with brandy, Madeira wine or sherry to make a drink similar to modern alcoholic eggnog.\n\n**Ingredients and Serving Style**\n\nTraditional homemade eggnog is made of milk or cream, sugar, raw eggs, one or more alcoholic spirits, and spices, often vanilla or nutmeg and in some recipes, cloves. Some recipes call for the eggs to be separated so that the egg whites can be whipped until they are thick; this gives the drink a frothy texture. American food show presenter Alton Brown points out that based on its ingredients, eggnog is \"almost identical to ice cream. It is technically just a stirred custard made of milk and egg.\"\n\nHomemade recipes may use vanilla ice cream blended into the beverage, particularly when the goal is to create a chilled drink. Some recipes call for condensed milk or evaporated milk in addition to milk and cream. Acidophilus milk, a fermented milk product, has been used to make eggnog. While some recipes call for unwhipped heavy cream, in some recipes, whipped cream is added to the mixture, which gives it a frothier texture.\n\n**Commercially Prepared**\n\nModern commercial eggnog manufacturers add gelatin and other thickeners, a cost-savings measure that enables manufacturers to produce a thick beverage while using less egg and cream. Commercial eggnog tends to contain less eggs than homemade nog. In the US, FDA regulations only require that 1.0 percent of a product's final weight be made up of egg yolk solids for it to bear the eggnog name.\n\n**Non-dairy and Vegan Versions**\n\nSome North American manufacturers offer soy-, almond-, oat-, rice- or coconut milk-based alternatives for vegans and those with dairy allergies, lactose intolerance or other dietary restrictions. The history of non-dairy eggnogs goes back to 1899 when Almeda Lambert, in her Guide for Nut Cookery, gave a recipe for \"Eggnog\" made using coconut cream, eggs, and sugar. In 1973, Eunice Farmilant, in The Natural Foods Sweet-Tooth Cookbook, gave a more modern non-dairy eggnog recipe.\n\n**Serving and Presentation**\n\nWhether homemade or commercial eggnog is being served, toppings may be added, such as grated nutmeg or ground cinnamon, whipped cream, a cinnamon stick, chocolate shavings, or a vanilla pod. Eggnog can be served in glasses, mugs or stemmed brandy snifters. Eggnog may be served to guests already poured into a glass or other container, or it may be served in a punch bowl, so that guests can serve themselves.\n\n**Use as Flavoring**\n\nThe distinctive spices that give eggnog its characteristic taste, including cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla, are used to create eggnog-flavored foods and beverages. Eggnog-flavored foods include eggnog ice cream, pie, cupcakes, rum cake, cookies, biscotti, pancake syrup, bread pudding, French toast, and waffles. Eggnog-flavored beverages include eggnog lattes (developed by Starbucks in the mid-1980s), eggnog-flavored coffee and tea, some craft beers (e.g., eggnog stout), and eggnog milkshakes.\n\n**Health and Safety**\n\nMost homemade eggnog recipes have historically included raw eggs. While the alcohol added to many homemade eggnogs is a bactericide, eggnog freshly made from raw eggs that are infected with salmonella and not heated can cause food poisoning. A very small percentage of raw eggs are infected with salmonella. In 1981 most of the residents and staff of a nursing home in the U.S became ill with salmonellosis, and four died. The cause was almost certainly an eggnog made on the spur of the moment, with some cases caused in a secondary outbreak caused by food being handled later by people with contaminated hands.\n\n**Alcohol Content**\n\nIndividuals should be aware of the alcohol content of eggnog from a responsible drinking perspective. When people make homemade alcoholic eggnog, or when they add spirits to commercially prepared eggnog, in some cases, the drink has a very high alcohol content. One columnist states that in his family Christmas tradition, \"it's not eggnog unless you can set fire to it,\" due to high alcohol percentage.\n\n**Nutritional Aspects**\n\nAccording to the USDA, a one cup (250 ml) serving of eggnog contains 343 kilocalories (1,440 kilojoules) (17% of a typical person's daily value of food energy); 34.4 grams of carbohydrates (11% of DV), including 21.4 grams of sugar; 19 grams of fat (29% of DV); and 9.7 grams of protein (19% of DV). TIME magazine's Tristan Stephenson states that eggnog's \"alcohol and sugar provide energy, eggs supply protein, and the fat from the milk or cream gives the wintertime drinker the necessary 'layers' to deal with the frost.\" TIME magazine also states that with its cream, eggs, and sugar ingredients, \"eggnog can pack in upwards of 400 kilocalories (1,700 kJ) per cup.\"\n\n**Reception and Consumption**\n\nEggnog has a polarized reception from food critics, chefs, and consumers. Esquire states that \"there doesn't seem to be a middle ground on eggnog. You either love it or hate it.\" While some are enthusiastic advocates of the beverage, others are critical of its taste or consistency. The CBC stated that the \"ancient drink can be quite divisive.\" The Guardian writer Andrew Shanahan described eggnog in a critical manner in 2006: \"People rarely get it right, but even if you do it still tastes horrible. The smell is like an omelet, and the consistency defies belief. It lurches around the glass like partially-sentient sludge.\"", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Eggnog\" following this outline:\n\n\nTerminology\nThe Modern Bartender's Guide  from 1878 lists many variant names for the drink It distinguishes \"plain eggnog,\" \"egg milk punch,\" and \"milk punch\" from one another It also includes variants such as \"Baltimore eggnog,\" \"General Jackson eggnog,\" \"Imperial eggnog,\" two types of \"sherry cobbler eggnog,\" as well as \"sherry cobbler with egg,\" \"mulled claret with egg,\" \"egg sour,\" and \"Saratoga egg lemonade\" (also called \"sea breeze\") [4] [2] [3]\n\n\nHistory\nThe origins, etymology, and the ingredients used to make original eggnog drinks are debated.\n\n\nEtymology and origins\nThe origins, etymology, and the ingredients used to make original eggnog drinks are debated.\n\n\nDevelopment\nIn Britain, the drink was originally popular among the aristocracy [7] \"Milk, eggs, and sherry were foods of the wealthy, so eggnog was often used in toasts to prosperity and good health.\" [14] Those who could afford milk and eggs and costly spirits mixed the eggnog with brandy, Madeira wine or sherry to make a drink similar to modern alcoholic eggnog [7]\n\n\nIngredients and serving style\nTraditional homemade eggnog is made of milk or cream, sugar, raw eggs, one or more alcoholic spirits, and spices, often vanilla or nutmeg and in some recipes, cloves Some recipes call for the eggs to be separated so that the egg whites can be whipped until they are thick;

derecho capable of producing damaging winds upwards of 100 mph (160 km/h) [17] By the early afternoon hours, a northwest-to-southeast-oriented dryline extended from eastern Colorado into the Texas Panhandle, while a cold front laid across northern and central Kansas Between these boundaries, dewpoints rose into the lower 60s °F and effective wind shear reached 50 kn (60 mph; 90 km/h), supportive of supercell thunderstorms that would likely evolve into a line of storms as a shortwave trough approached from the west [18] Given the environment, the SPC issued a particularly dangerous situation severe thunderstorm watch across much of Kansas, northwestern Oklahoma, and the far northeastern Texas Panhandle [19]  An intense supercell in Custer County, Oklahoma formed an intense multi-vortex tornado near Custer City, resulting in a tornado emergency [20] This tornado was accompanied by an intense rear-flank downdraft surge, with the total damage path width being recorded at 2.7 mi (4.3 km) A Ka-POL radar from Texas Tech University had been recording the tornado throughout its life cycle, and recorded a wind gust of 87.9 m/s (197 mph; 316 km/h) near the surface, while confirming the tornado's actual width of 1 mi (1.6 km) [21] An intense supercell developed in north-central Kansas, producing large hail in excess of 2 in (51 mm), tornadoes, and a wind gust to 71 kn (82 mph; 131 km/h) near Russell, [22] eventually growing upscale as additional convective clusters formed to the southwest [23] In Oklahoma, an isolated intense supercell developed and tracked eastward toward the Oklahoma City metropolitan area as low-level wind shear began to increase [24] Meanwhile, dual mesoscale convective vortices tracked across eastern Kansas, [25] contributing to widespread damaging wind reports—including multiple high wind gusts in excess of 65 kn (75 mph; 120 km/h)—as well as several tornadoes [26] As the complexes continued into Missouri, they encountered more stable air, causing the severe threat to gradually diminish [27]\n\n\nMay 19\nOn May 19, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) outlined a level 4/Moderate risk of severe weather across southwest to

causing the severe threat to gradually diminish [27]\n\n\nMay 20–21\nThe severe threat shifted northward on May 20 as the SPC issued a level 3/Enhanced risk across northeastern Colorado and southwestern Nebraska Here, forecasters expected a mixture of supercells and clusters of storms to originate near the Palmer Divide Although rich moisture waned with westward extent, [28] dewpoints in the upper 50s to lower 60s °F were expected to spread northwestward from Kansas and into Colorado [29] Thunderstorms developed in this area by the late afternoon hours, though their growth was stunted by marginal instability [30] Several discrete supercells eventually evolved across northeastern Colorado and began to grow upscale while encountering a more moist and unstable environment to the east across western Nebraska [31] The bowing line of storms traversed Nebraska and eventually Iowa through the pre-dawn and early morning hours of May 21, resulting in continued damaging wind gusts [32] [33]\n\n\nMay 22\nOn May 22, the SPC outlined an Enhanced risk extending from central Texas across southeastern Oklahoma, extreme northwestern Louisiana, and southwestern Arkansas [42] In Texas, a cold front stretched from the Red River southwestward into the Permian Basin, with a surface trough just ahead of that front Supercells were expected to evolve within a sheared and deeply unstable environment given effective wind shear of 60 kn (70 mph; 110 km/h) and mixed-layer CAPE of 3,000 J/kg As such, very large hail was anticipated to be the main threat, although isolated tornadoes were possible too before storms grew upscale into one or more convective lines [43] To the northeast, lines of storms tracked across Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Tennessee, with a primary risk of damaging winds and large hail [44] [45] Meanwhile, intense supercells developed across central Texas in a very unstable and deeply sheared environment, riding along outflow boundaries that enhanced the tornado threat [46] A particularly intense EF3 tornado developed southwest of Sterling City where rocks, grass, and topsoil were stripped off of the ground A 300 yd (270 m) wide path of trees were debarked and sandblasted, with only trunks remaining in some cases Caliche roads were also stripped [47] Ongoing storms across Texas eventually evolved into an intense mesoscale convective system moving across eastern portions of the state and into Louisiana through the late evening [48]\n\n\nMay 23–24\nOn May 23, the SPC issued an Enhanced risk over central Nebraska to Western Iowa for the threat of damaging winds Conditions weren't quite as favorable this day compared to others with dew points only expected to reach the upper 50s °F, creating conditions for high-base supercells, lowering the tornado potential However, CAPE values were still able to reach 1000-3000 J/kg Combined with shear reaching 45-55 kts, conditions were favorable for severe weather [49] Storms initiated along a front over northwest Nebraska around 4pm CDT, though the line quickly dissipated with only a supercell able to maintain itself as it went around the corner of Colorado as it produced several tornadoes [50] Eventually the line reformed over Southern Nebraska and began to produce damaging winds, growing to the height of the state at 1am CDT Despite nighttime cooling, the line maintained itself and swept across all of Iowa bringing damaging winds up to 85 mph to the entire state and producing brief, weak tornadoes [51]\n\n\nMay 25–27\nOn May 25, the SPC warned of an outbreak of severe thunderstorms across a level 4/Moderate risk area that encompassed much of Oklahoma and Kansas, as well as southwestern Missouri In this region, forecasters expected the development of a few discrete supercells that would be capable of producing giant hail and strong to violent tornadoes Across the northern portion of the risk, these supercells were forecast to evolve into a mesoscale convective system with swaths of damaging winds into the overnight hours [55] The potential for a level 5/High risk was discussed by forecasters in the preceding 24 hours given \"a rare combination of instability and shear\" that was depicted by model guidance [56] However, multiple uncertainties precluded a categorical upgrade, particularly questions about the influence of storms in Texas on the risk area farther north A broad upper-level trough existed over the Western United States, with several embedded shortwaves, one of which was expected to translate across the risk area during the afternoon A stationary boundary lifted northward as a warm front while a dryline sharpened from western Kansas into western Texas In the warm sector between these boundaries, dewpoints rose into the upper 60s to even mid-70s °F, aiding in the development of extreme mixed-layer instability of 4,000–5,000 J/kg [57] [58] A particularly dangerous situation tornado watch was subsequently issued for portions of extreme northern Texas, much of Oklahoma, and south-central Kansas [59]\n\n\nConfirmed tornadoes\nThis large, violent, multi-vortex tornado first touched down near the town of Villisca in Page County and moved northeastward at EF1 intensity, destroying all but one wall of an outbuilding and damaging the roof of a home It then clipped the far northwestern tip of Taylor County before moving into Adams County, inflicting EF0 damage to trees Continuing northeastward, the tornado reached EF1 intensity again as it approached and passed southeast of Nodaway, snapping wooden power poles, heavily damaging or destroying outbuildings, causing minor damage to homes, and snapping trees [82] Continuing northeastward, the tornado passed just west of Brooks, destroying and throwing a grain bin and damaging trees Crossing US 34 west of Corning and continuing northeastward, the tornado heavily damaged or destroyed outbuildings, inflicted roof damage to homes and snapped trees As the tornado crossed Iowa 148, an outbuilding was obliterated, and a home suffered moderate roof damage with its garage being destroyed This damage was rated low-end EF2 [82] A woman driving on Iowa 148 died when she was ejected from her car after it was lofted by the tornado [83] The tornado continued northeastward over rural, open terrain, with the only damage being EF0-EF1 damage to the roofs of an outbuilding and a home along the outer edge of the circulation The next area of concentrated damage was at the intersection of 150th Street and Notchwood Avenue The tornado was at high-end EF3 intensity here and a cinderblock home was completely leveled with the debris collapsing into the basement Outbuildings on the property were destroyed, a loaded grain bin had its top ripped off, a tractor-trailer was lofted and turned 360°, and trees were snapped To the northeast of here, the tornado continued over open terrain EF2 damage was inflicted to a large metal outbuilding that lost its roof with EF1 roof damage to a home along with a destroyed outbuilding It also toppled at least five wind turbines at EF2 strength along this portion of the track, including one turbine that caught on fire [82] The tornado exhibited violent motion and multiple vortices along this segment of the path as well.\n\n\nNodaway–Corning–Greenfield, Iowa\nThis large, violent, multi-vortex tornado first touched down near the town of Villisca in Page County and moved northeastward at EF1 intensity, destroying all but one wall of an outbuilding and damaging the roof of a home It then clipped the far northwestern tip of Taylor County before moving into Adams County, inflicting EF0 damage to trees Continuing northeastward, the tornado reached EF1 intensity again as it approached and passed southeast of Nodaway, snapping wooden power poles, heavily damaging or destroying outbuildings, causing minor damage to homes, and snapping trees [82] Continuing northeastward, the tornado passed just west of Brooks, destroying and throwing a grain bin and damaging trees Crossing US 34 west of Corning and continuing northeastward, the tornado heavily damaged or destroyed outbuildings, inflicted roof damage to homes and snapped trees As the tornado crossed Iowa 148, an outbuilding was obliterated, and a home suffered moderate roof damage with its garage being destroyed This damage was rated low-end EF2 [82] A woman driving on Iowa 148 died when she was ejected from her car after it was lofted by the tornado [83] The tornado continued northeastward over rural, open terrain, with the only damage being EF0-EF1 damage to the roofs of an outbuilding and a home along the outer edge of the circulation The next area of concentrated damage was at the intersection of 150th Street and Notchwood Avenue The tornado was at high-end EF3 intensity here and a cinderblock home was completely leveled with the debris collapsing into the basement Outbuildings on the property were destroyed, a loaded grain bin had its top ripped off, a tractor-trailer was lofted and turned 360°, and trees were snapped To the northeast of here, the tornado continued over open terrain EF2 damage was inflicted to a large metal outbuilding that lost its roof with EF1 roof damage to a home along with a destroyed outbuilding It also toppled at least five wind turbines at EF2 strength along this portion of the track, including one turbine that caught on fire [82] The tornado exhibited violent motion and multiple vortices along this segment of the path as well.\n\n\nForestburg–Rosston–Era–Valley View–Pilot Point, Texas\nThis intense, deadly, long-tracked tornado initially touched down southeast of Bowie in Montague County at 9:39 pm CDT It initially caused EF0-EF1 damage to trees and outbuildings as it moved through rural areas Moving eastward, the tornado intensified to EF2 strength, causing severe damage to two rural residences, with lesser damage being inflicted to other nearby residences The tornado then weakened slightly as it continued eastward and passed south of Forestburg Widespread EF0 to high-end EF1 damage to trees and outbuildings, along with minor damage to homes, was observed along this segment of the path The tornado further weakened as it turned east-southeastward, crossed into Cooke County, and passed through Rosston, causing widespread EF0 tree damage As the tornado approached and crossed FM 51 south of Era, the tornado strengthened again, with trees and structures suffering EF1 damage Further strengthening occurred as the tornado continued eastward southeast of Era and west of Valley View, inflicting EF2 damage to three residences After causing some additional EF1 damage, the tornado reached its peak intensity of low-end EF3 along County Road 200 [82] Several newly constructed homes were heavily damaged or destroyed with roofs removed and exterior walls knocked down To the east, the tornado struck a neighborhood along West Lone Oak Rd at EF2 intensity heavily damaging manufactured and mobile homes, including some that were demolished All seven fatalities occurred at this location The tornado was at its maximum width of 1,200 yd (1,100 m) at this point, but the damage path was over a mile wide It is believed that several smaller circulations were rotating around the tornado, making it seem larger than it actually was [85]\n\n\nKeetonville–Claremore–Pryor, Oklahoma\nThis very large, intense tornado touched down on the south side of Limestone in Rogers County at 11:19 pm CDT Upon touching down, the tornado inflicted roof damage to a home and uprooted trees at EF1 intensity The tornado then moved eastward and strengthened to high-end EF1 intensity as it passed north of Valley Park, snapping and uprooting more trees The tornado then passed through Keetonville, continuing to snap and uproot trees as it began to move along SH-20 The tornado then turned to the east-northeast and moved into Claremore, snapping dozens of trees, and damaging businesses, metal building systems, and other structures An area of EF2 damage was observed just east of downtown, where two homes and a two-story building had their roofs partially removed and power poles were snapped The tornado then continued eastward, continuing to inflict high-end EF1 roof damage to homes and snapping and uprooting trees before crossing I-44 north of Justice The tornado then restrengthened to EF2 intensity after crossing the interstate and turning east-northeastward, partially or completely removing the roofs off several houses, including some that had exterior walls knocked down, inflicted heavy damage to the Cherokee Casino Will Rogers Downs while destroying several RVs nearby, (the casino didn't reopen until three months later) [90] flattening an outbuilding, and snapping numerous trees The tornado then briefly reached its peak intensity of mid-range EF3 along E480 Road Two homes had all of their exterior walls knocked with one of them having some interior walls knocked down as well Two nearby homes suffered heavy EF2 damage as well with roofs removed and exterior walls knocked down The tornado then briefly paralleled I-44 at high-end EF2 intensity, ripping off roofs and knocking down the exterior walls of homes, heavily damaging or destroying outbuildings, and snapping and uprooting numerous trees [82]\n\n\nBellefonte–Olvey–Pyatt–Summit, Arkansas\nThis large, strong, early-morning tornado initially touched down at 3:27 a.m CDT (08:27 UTC) south of Bellefonte, and quickly strengthened to low-end EF2 intensity as it moved east, destroying a hay barn It also damaged trees, snapped power poles, and caused roof and exterior wall damage to houses; this damage was rated mid-range to high-end EF1 The tornado then weakened slightly to EF1 intensity as it continued to snap trees in an open field before crossing US 65 After crossing the highway, it caused minor damage to the roofs and light poles of the Boone County Sheriff's Department and an Arkansas State Police troop center, damaged a storage unit complex, overturned an RV, and caused a large metal building to collapse as it continued to move east To the east of there, the tornado grew in width and continued to snap trees and power poles It then quickly intensified to low end EF3 intensity, throwing and destroying two unanchored homes along Penny Lane, injuring one person A nearby mobile home was lofted, rolled, and destroyed, and trees were snapped, including some that were stubbed [82] The tornado then turned northeastward and passed southeast of Olvey, continuing to cause damage to trees, and killing a woman inside of a mobile home which was destroyed [94] Extensive EF1 tree damage continued as the tornado continued east-northeastward and crossed into Marion County It then passed south of Pyatt, where more homes suffered moderate to heavy roof damage, mobile homes were heavily damaged, including one that was rolled and destroyed, and more trees were snapped Three people were killed as it moved south of, and eventually crossed, US 62 where it briefly strengthened to EF2 strength A home was heavily damaged and power poles were left leaning After continuing northeast and snapping trees at EF1 intensity as it crossed AR 125, the tornado again briefly reached EF2 intensity A mobile home was completely obliterated with no sign of any part of the structure being left behind and more trees were snapped The tornado continued to cause significant tree damage until it dissipated north-northwest of Summit at 4:04 a.m CDT (09:04 UTC) [82]\n\n\nYellville–Briarcliff–Elizabeth, Arkansas\nAs the EF3 Olvey tornado was occluding and dissipating, this very large, long-tracked tornado developed at 3:59 a.m CDT (08:59 UTC) south of Yellville in Marion County Moving generally eastward as it fluctuated between mid-range to high-end EF1 intensity, the tornado snapped and uprooted numerous trees as it approached and then crossed AR 14 Beyond that point, the tornado continued to snap and uproot trees as it moved along county roads with some homes suffering minor roof damage as well Further to the east along Backway Road, a mobile home and an outbuilding were shifted off their foundations, and more trees were snapped or uprooted, including one tree that fell on the mobile home More trees were snapped or uprooted as the tornado crossed County Road 6074 and an outbuilding was destroyed The tornado then grew significantly to over 1,000 yards (910 m) wide, snapping and uprooting numerous trees as it moved over Hand Mountain before crossing the White River into Baxter County Some homes in a small residential area on the other side of the river suffered minor roof and siding damage and countless trees were snapped or uprooted The tornado then reached its maximum width of 1 mile (1.6 km) as it briefly turned east-northeastward before continuing eastward, producing a widespread area of snapped and uprooted trees The tornado then contracted slightly, producing swaths of uprooted and snapped trees before crossing the White River again The tornado then abruptly made a sharp left turn as it passed between Arkana and Norfork and began moving north-northeast, crossing the White River a third time and approaching Briarcliff, snapping and uprooting more trees as it moved over and then away from AR 201 As it reached AR 5, the tornado increased in strength, snapping and uprooting dozens of trees, and heavily damaging homes and a metal shop building Five fifth-wheel recreation trailers at an RV/trailer camping park were tossed and destroyed, resulting in a fatality The tornado also snapped two-poled wooden 350 kW transmission towers and bent two pairs of double-posted steel high transmission line posts in half Damage in this area was rated EF1-EF2 [82] [96]\n\n\nMorehouse–Sikeston–Diehlstadt, Missouri\nThis intense, fast-moving tornado occurred along the northern edge of a much larger area of damaging straight-line winds It first touched down at EF1 intensity northeast of Baker in Stoddard County at 7:15 am CDT, snapping a power pole along County Road 293 Moving northeastward, the tornado steadily strengthened as it crossed into New Madrid County, damaging and snapping more trees and inflicting roof damage to a home An area of EF2 damage occurred just beyond this point where at least five consecutive wooden power poles were snapped to the south of Morehouse After snapping more trees at high-end EF1 strength, the tornado abruptly reached low-end EF3 intensity along County Road 824 A well-built brick home had its roof removed and most of its exterior walls knocked down and wooden power poles were snapped The tornado quickly weakened back to high-end EF1 intensity as it crossed US 60 More trees were snapped, a mobile home suffered roof damage and an outbuilding was heavily damaged Another small area of EF2 damage occurred along Route FF south of Browns where several wooden power poles were snapped After flipping a center pivot irrigation system, the tornado entered Sikeston while straddling the New Madrid-Scott County at EF1 intensity, snapping and uprooting trees, and inflicting roof, siding, and exterior wall damage to homes The tornado then moved solidly into Scott County and through the south side Sikeston A widespread area of snapped and uprooted trees and roof damage to homes and outbuildings occurred Along South Main Street (US 61/US 62), a strip mall and several businesses had their roofs partially or completely removed The tornado continued to snap power poles and trees and damage homes as it moved northeastward until it reached US 62 again east of Sikeston, where it restrengthened to EF2 intensity A school and a business had part of their roofs removed and large cinderblock walls knocked down, another business suffered roof damage, a tall wooden light pole at a ball field was knocked down, a home lost most of its roof, and more trees and power poles were snapped The tornado then exited Sikeston as it continued northeastward as it approached and then crossed I-55 north of Miner, damaging outbuildings, inflicting roof damage to homes, and snapping trees at EF1 strength Similar damage occurred after the tornado crossed the interstate and into more rural areas with center pivot irrigation systems also being damaged The tornado then clipped the northwestern part of Diehlstadt, damaging trees before dissipating north of the town [82] [97]\n\n\nEddyville–Crider–Charleston–Barnsley, Kentucky\nThis long-tracked, high-end EF3 tornado paralleled I-69 along its path, striking some of the same areas affected by the 2021 Western Kentucky tornado [100] It touched down at 8:01 PM (00:01 UTC) in Lyon County, Kentucky just northeast of Eddyville and moved eastward across US 641 at high-end EF1 intensity, snapping trees, damaging a home, and collapsing the roof of an outbuilding Turning northeastward, the tornado snapped or uprooted more trees, before reaching low-end EF2 intensity as it crossed KY 3169 A home suffered heavy damage and had an exterior wall knocked down The home's poorly built attached garage was also destroyed with the debris wrapping around the back of the structure, which left a trench in the ground Two outbuildings were destroyed, many trees were snapped, and cycloidal scour marks were left in farm fields as well [82] [97] As the tornado crossed into Caldwell County, the first of four tornado emergencies was issued as a debris ball was evident on radar and law enforcement reported that a large tornado was in progress [101] Upon entering Caldwell County, the tornado weakened to high-end EF1 intensity, snapping dozens of trees and damaging power poles Southeast of Crider, a barn along KY 91 was mostly destroyed The tornado then turned due east, snapping and uprooting more trees north of Princeton before briefly strengthening to high-end EF2 intensity, along KY 293 A mobile home was destroyed, a home was completely unroofed, and trees were snapped Another home suffered minor roof damage as well [82] [97]\n\n\nImpact\nThe start of the 2024 Indianapolis 500 was delayed on May 26th due to thunderstorms near the event [103] On May 27, a New York Mets game against the Los Angeles Dodgers was postponed for a day due to the severe storms, [104] with severe storms also resulting in

the United States, resulting in numerous tornadoes, straight-line winds, and fatalities.\n\n**Meteorological Synopsis**\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center (SPC) outlined a level 4/Moderate risk of severe weather across southwest to central Kansas, encompassed by a level 3/Enhanced risk that extended into northwestern Oklahoma as well. Across the highest risk area, forecasters warned of the potential for a developing derecho capable of producing damaging winds upwards of 100 mph (160 km/h). By the early afternoon hours, a northwest-to-southeast-oriented dryline extended from eastern Colorado into the Texas Panhandle, while a cold front laid across northern and central Kansas. Between these boundaries, dewpoints rose into the lower 60s °F and effective wind shear reached 50 kn (60 mph; 90 km/h), supportive of supercell thunderstorms that would likely evolve into a line of storms as a shortwave trough approached from the west.\n\nGiven the environment, the SPC issued a particularly dangerous situation severe thunderstorm watch across much of Kansas, northwestern Oklahoma, and the far northeastern Texas Panhandle. An intense supercell in Custer County, Oklahoma formed an intense multi-vortex tornado near Custer City, resulting in a tornado emergency. This tornado was accompanied by an intense rear-flank downdraft surge, with the total damage path width being recorded at 2.7 mi (4.3 km). A Ka-POL radar from Texas Tech University had been recording the tornado throughout its life cycle, and recorded a wind gust of 87.9 m/s (197 mph; 316 km/h) near the surface, while confirming the tornado's actual width of 1 mi (1.6 km).\n\n**May 19**\n\nOn May 19, the SPC outlined a level 4/Moderate risk of severe weather across southwest to central Kansas, encompassed by a level 3/Enhanced risk that extended into northwestern Oklahoma as well. Across the highest risk area, forecasters warned of the potential for a developing derecho capable of producing damaging winds upwards of 100 mph (160 km/h). By the early afternoon hours, a northwest-to-southeast-oriented dryline extended from eastern Colorado into the Texas Panhandle, while a cold front laid across northern and central Kansas. Between these boundaries, dewpoints rose into the lower 60s °F and effective wind shear reached 50 kn (60 mph; 90 km/h), supportive of supercell thunderstorms that would likely evolve into a line of storms as a shortwave trough approached from the west.\n\nGiven the environment, the SPC issued a particularly dangerous situation severe thunderstorm watch across much of Kansas, northwestern Oklahoma, and the far northeastern Texas Panhandle.

Here, forecasters expected a mixture of supercells and clusters of storms to originate near the Palmer Divide. Although rich moisture waned with westward extent, dewpoints in the upper 50s to lower 60s °F were expected to spread northwestward from Kansas and into Colorado. Thunderstorms developed in this area by the late afternoon hours, though their growth was stunted by marginal instability. Several discrete supercells eventually evolved across northeastern Colorado and began to grow upscale while encountering a more moist and unstable environment to the east across western Nebraska. The bowing line of storms traversed Nebraska and eventually Iowa through the pre-dawn and early morning hours of May 21, resulting in continued damaging wind gusts.\n\n**May 22**\n\nOn May 22, the SPC outlined an Enhanced risk extending from central Texas across southeastern Oklahoma, extreme northwestern Louisiana, and southwestern Arkansas. In Texas, a cold front stretched from the Red River southwestward into the Permian Basin, with a surface trough just ahead of that front. Supercells were expected to evolve within a sheared and deeply unstable environment given effective wind shear of 60 kn (70 mph; 110 km/h) and mixed-layer CAPE of 3,000 J/kg. As such, very large hail was anticipated to be the main threat, although isolated tornadoes were possible too before storms grew upscale into one or more convective lines. To the northeast, lines of storms tracked across Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Tennessee, with a primary risk of damaging winds and large hail. Meanwhile, intense supercells developed across central Texas in a very unstable and deeply sheared environment, riding along outflow boundaries that enhanced the tornado threat. A particularly intense EF3 tornado developed southwest of Sterling City where rocks, grass, and topsoil were stripped off of the ground.\n\n**May 23–24**\n\nOn May 23, the SPC issued an Enhanced risk over central Nebraska to Western Iowa for the threat of damaging winds. Conditions weren't quite as favorable this day compared to others with dew points only expected to reach the upper 50s °F, creating conditions for high-base supercells, lowering the tornado potential. However, CAPE values were still able to reach 1000-3000 J/kg. Combined with shear reaching 45-55 kts, conditions were favorable for severe weather. Storms initiated along a front over northwest Nebraska around 4pm CDT, though the line quickly dissipated with only a supercell able to maintain itself as it went around the corner of Colorado as it produced several tornadoes. Eventually the line reformed over Southern Nebraska and began to produce damaging winds, growing to the height of the state at 1am CDT.\n\n**May 25–27**\n\nOn May 25, the SPC warned of an outbreak of severe thunderstorms across a level 4/Moderate risk area that encompassed much of Oklahoma and Kansas, as well as southwestern Missouri. In this region, forecasters expected the development of a few discrete supercells that would be capable of producing giant hail and strong to violent tornadoes. Across the northern portion of the risk, these supercells were forecast to evolve into a mesoscale convective system with swaths of damaging winds into the overnight hours. The potential for a level 5/High risk was discussed by forecasters in the preceding 24 hours given \"a rare combination of instability and shear\" that was depicted by model guidance. However, multiple uncertainties precluded a categorical upgrade, particularly questions about the influence of storms in Texas on the risk area farther north.\n\n**Confirmed Tornadoes**\n\nThis large, violent, multi-vortex tornado first touched down near the town of Villisca in Page County and moved northeastward at EF1 intensity, destroying all but one wall of an outbuilding and damaging the roof of a home. It then clipped the far northwestern tip of Taylor County before moving into Adams County, inflicting EF0 damage to trees. Continuing northeastward, the tornado reached EF1 intensity again as it approached and passed southeast of Nodaway, snapping wooden power poles, heavily damaging or destroying outbuildings, causing minor damage to homes, and snapping trees.\n\n**Forestburg–Rosston–Era–Valley View–Pilot Point, Texas**\n\nThis intense, deadly, long-tracked tornado initially touched down southeast of Bowie in Montague County at 9:39 pm CDT. It initially caused EF0-EF1 damage to trees and outbuildings as it moved through rural areas. Moving eastward, the tornado intensified to EF2 strength, causing severe damage to two rural residences, with lesser damage being inflicted to other nearby residences. The tornado then weakened slightly as it continued eastward and passed south of Forestburg, causing widespread EF0 to high-end EF1 damage to trees and outbuildings, along with minor damage to homes.\n\n**Keetonville–Claremore–Pryor, Oklahoma**\n\nThis very large, intense tornado touched down on the south side of Limestone in Rogers County at 11:19 pm CDT. Upon touching down, the tornado inflicted roof damage to a home and uprooted trees at EF1 intensity. The tornado then moved eastward and strengthened to high-end EF1 intensity as it passed north of Valley Park, snapping and uprooting more trees. The tornado then passed through Keetonville, continuing to snap and uproot trees as it began to move along SH-20. The tornado then turned to the east-northeast and moved into Claremore, snapping dozens of trees, and damaging businesses, metal building systems, and other structures.\n\n**Bellefonte–Olvey–Pyatt–Summit, Arkansas**\n\nThis large, strong, early-morning tornado initially touched down at 3:27 am CDT south of Bellefonte, and quickly strengthened to low-end EF2 intensity as it moved east, destroying a hay barn. The tornado then weakened slightly to EF1 intensity as it continued to snap trees in an open field before crossing US 65. The tornado then grew in width and continued to snap trees and power poles as it moved east. It then quickly intensified to low-end EF3 intensity, throwing and destroying two unanchored homes along Penny Lane, injuring one person.\n\n**Yellville–Briarcliff–Elizabeth, Arkansas**\n\nAs the EF3 Olvey tornado was occluding and dissipating, this very large, long-tracked tornado developed at 3:59 am CDT south of Yellville in Marion County. Moving generally eastward as it fluctuated between mid-range to high-end EF1 intensity, the tornado snapped and uprooted numerous trees as it approached and then crossed AR 14. Further to the east along Backway Road, a mobile home and an outbuilding were shifted off their foundations, and more trees were snapped or uprooted, including one tree that fell on the mobile home.\n\n**Morehouse–Sikeston–Diehlstadt, Missouri**\n\nThis intense, fast-moving tornado occurred along the northern edge of a much larger area of damaging straight-line winds. It first touched down at EF1 intensity northeast of Baker in Stoddard County at 7:15 am CDT, snapping a power pole along County Road 293. The tornado then steadily strengthened as it crossed into New Madrid County, damaging and snapping more trees and inflicting roof damage to a home.

evening [48]\n\n\nMay 23–24\nOn May 23, the SPC issued an Enhanced risk over central Nebraska to Western Iowa for the threat of damaging winds Conditions weren't quite as favorable this day compared to others with dew points only expected to reach the upper 50s °F, creating conditions for high-base supercells, lowering the tornado potential However, CAPE values were still able to reach 1000-3000 J/kg Combined with shear reaching 45-55 kts, conditions were favorable for severe weather [49] Storms initiated along a front over northwest Nebraska around 4pm CDT, though the line quickly dissipated with only a supercell able to maintain itself as it went around the corner of Colorado as it produced several tornadoes [50] Eventually the line reformed over Southern Nebraska and began to produce damaging winds, growing to the height of the state at 1am CDT Despite nighttime cooling, the line maintained itself and swept across all of Iowa bringing damaging winds up to 85 mph to the entire state and producing brief, weak tornadoes [51]\n\n\nMay 25–27\nOn May 25, the SPC warned of an outbreak of severe thunderstorms across a level 4/Moderate risk area that encompassed much of Oklahoma and Kansas, as well as southwestern Missouri In this region, forecasters expected the development of a few discrete supercells that would be capable of producing giant hail and strong to violent tornadoes Across the northern portion of the risk, these supercells were forecast to evolve into a mesoscale convective system with swaths of damaging winds into the overnight hours [55] The potential for a level 5/High risk was discussed by forecasters in the preceding 24 hours given \"a rare combination of instability and shear\" that was depicted by model guidance [56] However, multiple uncertainties precluded a categorical upgrade, particularly questions about the influence of storms in Texas on the risk area farther north A broad upper-level trough existed over the Western United States, with several embedded shortwaves, one of which was expected to translate across the risk area during the afternoon A stationary boundary lifted northward as a warm front while a dryline sharpened from western Kansas into western Texas In the warm sector between these boundaries, dewpoints rose into the upper 60s to even mid-70s °F, aiding in the development of extreme mixed-layer instability of 4,000–5,000 J/kg [57] [58] A particularly dangerous situation tornado watch was subsequently issued for portions of extreme northern Texas, much of Oklahoma, and south-central Kansas [59]\n\n\nConfirmed tornadoes\nThis large, violent, multi-vortex tornado first touched down near the town of Villisca in Page County and moved northeastward at EF1 intensity, destroying all but one wall of an outbuilding and damaging the roof of a home It then clipped the far northwestern tip of Taylor County before moving into Adams County, inflicting EF0 damage to trees Continuing northeastward, the tornado reached EF1 intensity again as it approached and passed southeast of Nodaway, snapping wooden power poles, heavily damaging or destroying outbuildings, causing minor damage to homes, and snapping trees [82] Continuing northeastward, the tornado passed just west of Brooks, destroying and throwing a grain bin and damaging trees Crossing US 34 west of Corning and continuing northeastward, the tornado heavily damaged or destroyed outbuildings, inflicted roof damage to homes and snapped trees As the tornado crossed Iowa 148, an outbuilding was obliterated, and a home suffered moderate roof damage with its garage being destroyed This damage was rated low-end EF2 [82] A woman driving on Iowa 148 died when she was ejected from her car after it was lofted by the tornado [83] The tornado continued northeastward over rural, open terrain, with the only damage being EF0-EF1 damage to the roofs of an outbuilding and a home along the outer edge of the circulation The next area of concentrated damage was at the intersection of 150th Street and Notchwood Avenue The tornado was at high-end EF3 intensity here and a cinderblock home was completely leveled with the debris collapsing into the basement Outbuildings on the property were destroyed, a loaded grain bin had its top ripped off, a tractor-trailer was lofted and turned 360°, and trees were snapped To the northeast of here, the tornado continued over open terrain EF2 damage was inflicted to a large metal outbuilding that lost its roof with EF1 roof damage to a home along with a destroyed outbuilding It also toppled at least five wind turbines at EF2 strength along this portion of the track, including one turbine that caught on fire [82] The tornado exhibited violent motion and multiple vortices along this segment of the path as well.\n\n\nNodaway–Corning–Greenfield, Iowa\nThis large, violent, multi-vortex tornado first touched down near the town of Villisca in Page County and moved northeastward at EF1 intensity, destroying all but one wall of an outbuilding and damaging the roof of a home It then clipped the far northwestern tip of Taylor County before moving into Adams County,

outbuilding was obliterated, and a home suffered moderate roof damage with its garage being destroyed This damage was rated low-end EF2 [82] A woman driving on Iowa 148 died when she was ejected from her car after it was lofted by the tornado [83] The tornado continued northeastward over rural, open terrain, with the only damage being EF0-EF1 damage to the roofs of an outbuilding and a home along the outer edge of the circulation The next area of concentrated damage was at the intersection of 150th Street and Notchwood Avenue The tornado was at high-end EF3 intensity here and a cinderblock home was completely leveled with the debris collapsing into the basement Outbuildings on the property were destroyed, a loaded grain bin had its top ripped off, a tractor-trailer was lofted and turned 360°, and trees were snapped To the northeast of here, the tornado continued over open terrain EF2 damage was inflicted to a large metal outbuilding that lost its roof with EF1 roof damage to a home along with a destroyed outbuilding It also toppled at least five wind turbines at EF2 strength along this portion of the track, including one turbine that caught on fire [82] The tornado exhibited violent motion and multiple vortices along this segment of the path as well.\n\n\nForestburg–Rosston–Era–Valley View–Pilot Point, Texas\nThis intense, deadly, long-tracked tornado initially touched down southeast of Bowie in Montague County at 9:39 pm CDT It initially caused EF0-EF1 damage to trees and outbuildings as it moved through rural areas Moving eastward, the tornado intensified to EF2 strength, causing severe damage to two rural residences, with lesser damage being inflicted to other nearby residences The tornado then weakened slightly as it continued eastward and passed south of Forestburg Widespread EF0 to high-end EF1 damage to trees and outbuildings, along with minor damage to homes, was observed along this segment of the path The tornado further weakened as it turned east-southeastward, crossed into Cooke County, and passed through Rosston, causing widespread EF0 tree damage As the tornado approached and crossed FM 51 south of Era, the tornado strengthened again, with trees and structures suffering EF1 damage Further strengthening occurred as the tornado continued eastward southeast of Era and west of Valley View, inflicting EF2 damage to three residences After causing some additional EF1 damage, the tornado reached its peak intensity of low-end EF3 along County Road 200 [82] Several newly constructed homes were heavily damaged or destroyed with roofs removed and exterior walls knocked down To the east, the tornado struck a neighborhood along West Lone Oak Rd at EF2 intensity heavily damaging manufactured and mobile homes, including some that were demolished All seven fatalities occurred at this location The tornado was at its maximum width of 1,200 yd (1,100 m) at this point, but the damage path was over a mile wide It is believed that several smaller circulations were rotating around the tornado, making it seem larger than it actually was [85]\n\n\nKeetonville–Claremore–Pryor, Oklahoma\nThis very large, intense tornado touched down on the south side of Limestone in Rogers County at 11:19 pm CDT Upon touching down, the tornado inflicted roof damage to a home and uprooted trees at EF1 intensity The tornado then moved eastward and strengthened to high-end EF1 intensity as it passed north of Valley Park, snapping and uprooting more trees The tornado then passed through Keetonville, continuing to snap and uproot trees as it began to move along SH-20 The tornado then turned to the east-northeast and moved into Claremore, snapping dozens of trees, and damaging businesses, metal building systems, and other structures An area of EF2 damage was observed just east of downtown, where two homes and a two-story building had their roofs partially removed and power poles were snapped The tornado then continued eastward, continuing to inflict high-end EF1 roof damage to homes and snapping and uprooting trees before crossing I-44 north of Justice The tornado then restrengthened to EF2 intensity after crossing the interstate and turning east-northeastward, partially or completely removing the roofs off several houses, including some that had exterior walls knocked down, inflicted heavy damage to the Cherokee Casino Will Rogers Downs while destroying several RVs nearby, (the casino didn't reopen until three months later) [90] flattening an outbuilding, and snapping numerous trees The tornado then briefly reached its peak intensity of mid-range EF3 along E480 Road Two homes had all of their exterior walls knocked with one of them having some interior walls knocked down as well Two nearby homes suffered heavy EF2 damage as well with roofs removed and exterior walls knocked down The tornado then briefly paralleled I-44 at high-end EF2 intensity, ripping off roofs and knocking down the exterior walls of homes, heavily damaging or destroying outbuildings, and snapping and uprooting numerous trees [82]\n\n\nBellefonte–Olvey–Pyatt–Summit, Arkansas\nThis large, strong, early-morning tornado initially touched down at 3:27 a.m CDT (08:27 UTC) south of Bellefonte, and quickly strengthened to low-end EF2 intensity as it moved east, destroying a hay barn It also damaged trees, snapped power poles, and caused roof and exterior wall damage to houses; this damage was rated mid-range to high-end EF1 The tornado then weakened slightly to EF1 intensity as it continued to snap trees in an open field before crossing US 65 After crossing the highway, it caused minor damage to the roofs and light poles of the Boone County Sheriff's Department and an Arkansas State Police troop center, damaged a storage unit complex, overturned an RV, and caused a large metal building to collapse as it continued to move east To the east of there, the tornado grew in width and continued to snap trees and power poles It then quickly intensified to low end EF3 intensity, throwing and destroying two unanchored homes along Penny Lane, injuring one person A nearby mobile home was lofted, rolled, and destroyed, and trees were snapped, including some that were stubbed [82] The tornado then turned northeastward and passed southeast of Olvey, continuing to cause damage to trees, and killing a woman inside of a mobile home which was destroyed [94] Extensive EF1 tree damage continued as the tornado continued east-northeastward and crossed into Marion County It then passed south of Pyatt, where more homes suffered moderate to heavy roof damage, mobile homes were heavily damaged, including one that was rolled and destroyed, and more trees were snapped Three people were killed as it moved south of, and eventually crossed, US 62 where it briefly strengthened to EF2 strength A home was heavily damaged and power poles were left leaning After continuing northeast and snapping trees at EF1 intensity as it crossed AR 125, the tornado again briefly reached EF2 intensity A mobile home was completely obliterated with no sign of any part of the structure being left behind and more trees were snapped The tornado continued to cause significant tree damage until it dissipated north-northwest of Summit at 4:04 a.m CDT (09:04 UTC) [82]\n\n\nYellville–Briarcliff–Elizabeth, Arkansas\nAs the EF3 Olvey tornado was occluding and dissipating, this very large, long-tracked tornado developed at 3:59 a.m CDT (08:59 UTC) south of Yellville in Marion County Moving generally eastward as it fluctuated between mid-range to high-end EF1 intensity, the tornado snapped and uprooted numerous trees as it approached and then crossed AR 14 Beyond that point, the tornado continued to snap and uproot trees as it moved along county roads with some homes suffering minor roof damage as well Further to the east along Backway Road, a mobile home and an outbuilding were shifted off their foundations, and more trees were snapped or uprooted, including one tree that fell on the mobile home More trees were snapped or uprooted as the tornado crossed County Road 6074 and an outbuilding was destroyed The tornado then grew significantly to over 1,000 yards (910 m) wide, snapping and uprooting numerous trees as it moved over Hand Mountain before crossing the White River into Baxter County Some homes in a small residential area on the other side of the river suffered minor roof and siding damage and countless trees were snapped or uprooted The tornado then reached its maximum width of 1 mile (1.6 km) as it briefly turned east-northeastward before continuing eastward, producing a widespread area of snapped and uprooted trees The tornado then contracted slightly, producing swaths of uprooted and snapped trees before crossing the White River again The tornado then abruptly made a sharp left turn as it passed between Arkana and Norfork and began moving north-northeast, crossing the White River a third time and approaching Briarcliff, snapping and uprooting more trees as it moved over and then away from AR 201 As it reached AR 5, the tornado increased in strength, snapping and uprooting dozens of trees, and heavily damaging homes and a metal shop building Five fifth-wheel recreation trailers at an RV/trailer camping park were tossed and destroyed, resulting in a fatality The tornado also snapped two-poled wooden 350 kW transmission towers and bent two pairs of double-posted steel high transmission line posts in half Damage in this area was rated EF1-EF2 [82] [96]\n\n\nMorehouse–Sikeston–Diehlstadt, Missouri\nThis intense, fast-moving tornado occurred along the northern edge of a much larger area of damaging straight-line winds It first touched down at EF1 intensity northeast of Baker in Stoddard County at 7:15 am CDT, snapping a power pole along County Road 293 Moving northeastward, the tornado steadily strengthened as it crossed into New Madrid County, damaging and snapping more trees and inflicting roof damage to a home An area of EF2 damage occurred just beyond this point where at least five consecutive wooden power poles were snapped to the south of Morehouse After snapping more trees at high-end EF1 strength, the tornado abruptly reached low-end EF3 intensity along County Road 824 A well-built brick home had its roof removed and most of its exterior walls knocked down and wooden power poles were snapped The tornado quickly weakened back to high-end EF1 intensity as it crossed US 60 More trees were snapped, a mobile home suffered roof damage and an outbuilding was heavily damaged Another small area of EF2 damage occurred along Route FF south of Browns where several wooden power poles were snapped After flipping a center pivot irrigation system, the tornado entered Sikeston while straddling the New Madrid-Scott County at EF1 intensity, snapping and uprooting trees, and inflicting roof, siding, and exterior wall damage to homes The tornado then moved solidly into Scott County and through the south side Sikeston A widespread area of snapped and uprooted trees and roof damage to homes and outbuildings occurred Along South Main Street (US 61/US 62), a strip mall and several businesses had their roofs partially or completely removed The tornado continued to snap power poles and trees and damage homes as it moved northeastward until it reached US 62 again east of Sikeston, where it restrengthened to EF2 intensity A school and a business had part of their roofs removed and large cinderblock walls knocked down, another business suffered roof damage, a tall wooden light pole at a ball field was knocked down, a home lost most of its roof, and more trees and power poles were snapped The tornado then exited Sikeston as it continued northeastward as it approached and then crossed I-55 north of Miner, damaging outbuildings, inflicting roof damage to homes, and snapping trees at EF1 strength Similar damage occurred after the tornado crossed the interstate and into more rural areas with center pivot irrigation systems also being damaged The tornado then clipped the northwestern part of Diehlstadt, damaging trees before dissipating north of the town [82] [97]\n\n\nEddyville–Crider–Charleston–Barnsley, Kentucky\nThis long-tracked, high-end EF3 tornado paralleled I-69 along its path, striking some of the same areas affected by the 2021 Western Kentucky tornado [100] It touched down at 8:01 PM (00:01 UTC) in Lyon County, Kentucky just northeast of Eddyville and moved eastward across US 641 at high-end EF1 intensity, snapping trees, damaging a home, and collapsing the roof of an outbuilding Turning northeastward, the tornado snapped or uprooted more trees, before reaching low-end EF2 intensity as it crossed KY 3169 A home suffered heavy damage and had an exterior wall knocked down The home's poorly built attached garage was also destroyed with the debris wrapping around the back of the structure, which left a trench in the ground Two outbuildings were destroyed, many trees were snapped, and cycloidal scour marks were left in farm fields as well [82] [97] As the tornado crossed into Caldwell County, the first of four tornado emergencies was issued as a debris ball was evident on radar and law enforcement reported that a large tornado was in progress [101] Upon entering Caldwell County, the tornado weakened to high-end EF1 intensity, snapping dozens of trees and damaging power poles Southeast of Crider, a barn along KY 91 was mostly destroyed The tornado then turned due east, snapping and uprooting more trees north of Princeton before briefly strengthening to high-end EF2 intensity, along KY 293 A mobile home was destroyed, a home was completely unroofed, and trees were snapped Another home suffered minor roof damage as well [82] [97]\n\n\nImpact\nThe start of the 2024 Indianapolis 500 was delayed on May 26th due to thunderstorms near the event [103] On May 27, a New York Mets game against the Los Angeles Dodgers was postponed for a day due to the severe storms, [104] with severe storms also resulting in ground stops at both LaGuardia Airport and John F Kennedy International Airport [105] One person was killed in Colorado due to a lightning strike, [8] while another person was killed when straight-line winds downed a tree onto them in Anchorage, Kentucky [82] A very large area of damaging straight-line winds impacted Central Alabama on May 27 Many large tree limbs were snapped, some trees were uprooted, and at least one home suffered minor exterior damage [82]\n\n\nIowa\nSeveral people were killed, and dozens injured in Greenfield, Iowa Hospitals in the Adair County Health System were evacuated [citation needed] Multiple fatalities and at least a dozen injuries have been confirmed There is also a curfew in effect indefinitely, and authorities have limited traffic in and out of town [106] [needs update]\n\n\nSouthern United States\nThe May 25–26 severe weather outbreak killed at least 26 people in total, including seven in Texas, two in Oklahoma, eight in Arkansas, five in Kentucky, one in Alabama, [5] [6] two in

{"title": "Tornado_outbreak_of_April_25–28,_2024", "content": "\nMeteorological synopsis\nOn April 20, 2024, the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center (SPC) first delineated a severe weather risk for April 25–26, highlighting a zone extending from the Central Great Plains northeastward to the Midwestern U.S The forecast was predicated on the development of thunderstorms downwind of an upper-tropospheric trough, where weather forecast models were depicting the advection of a moist airmass [24] The forecast was maintained through the next two days The risk area was expanded into northeastern Texas on April 22 and later extended to include the possibility of severe weather on April 27 [25] [26]\n\n\nApril 25\nOn the morning of April 25, the SPC predicted an enhanced risk of severe weather for parts of Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, highlighting the risk of tornadoes and large hail in connection with storms developing along a dry line between the Texas Panhandle and northwestern Kansas [27] This risk was later narrowed to two focal areas: one in northwestern Kansas associated with supercells during the afternoon and evening, and a second near the Red River, associated with an forecast cluster of storms during the overnight hours [28] During the afternoon, numerous thunderstorms developed near the dry line in eastern Colorado and near a low-pressure area in northeastern Colorado, southwestern Nebraska, and northwestern Kansas [29] These storms weakened during the evening upon moving northeastward into areas with less atmospheric instability, [30] with the threat for tornadoes diminishing overnight [31] The SPC received six tornado reports from April 25 from states affected by these storms; five EFU tornadoes were confirmed [32]\n\n\nApril 26\nAnother cluster of thunderstorms developed in the Permian Basin of Texas in the early overnight hours into April 26, [33] becoming and maintaining severe characteristics as they tracked northeast into the Red River Valley [34] This cluster eventually organized into a quasi-linear convective system over southern Oklahoma, potentially producing at least one tornado [35] [36] The SPC received three reports of tornadoes from Oklahoma during the early morning hours of April 26; [32] seven weak tornadoes were later confirmed in the state [37]\n\n\nApril 27–28\n\nIn the morning hours of April 27, the Storm Prediction Center issued a moderate risk (level 4) for central Oklahoma, north-central Texas, extreme southwestern Missouri, and southeastern Kansas The moderate risk included a significant 15% tornado risk, a significant 30% wind risk, and a significant 45% hail risk [46] Multiple supercells formed that afternoon in northern Texas, western Oklahoma, southeastern Kansas, and northwestern Missouri A 'particularly dangerous situation' (PDS) tornado watch was issued for western Oklahoma and northern Texas, warning of elevated probabilities for several tornadoes, some of which could be intense [47]\n\nConfirmed tornadoes\nThis very large, violent, long-tracked tornado prompted the issuance of two tornado emergencies as it moved through the northwestern Omaha Metro [53] [54] The tornado first touched down at 3:30 pm CDT south of West Q Road near the Platte River and traveled northeastward, damaging trees and farmstead outbuildings at EF0-EF1 intensity [37] [55] [56] The tornado then intensified to EF2 strength, damaging numerous homes, including one that was unroofed, overturned multiple center pivots in several acreages, and damaged outbuildings and a grain silo [55] [37] The first of two tornado emergencies was issued for this tornado at that time as well; it would remain under this tag for essentially the rest of its existence [57] The tornado then weakened to EF1 intensity as it crossed L-28B, damaging a horse farm and a home, several trees, and other center pivots [37] [55] As the tornado entered the western part of Omaha neighborhood of Elkhorn, it abruptly became violent and widened significantly, striking multiple subdivisions Many homes in this area were severely damaged or destroyed, including some that were flattened At least three homes were partially to complete swept away as well and metal building system was heavily damaged The tornado also collapsed metal light poles near the Prospect Hill Cemetery, where several headstones were damaged, a landscaping business was damaged, and trees and wooden and steel power poles were snapped Most of the most intense damage in the area was rated high-end EF3, but two small pockets of low-end EF4 damage were confirmed; both of these locations had homes that were partially to completely swept away with the first location also having debarked trees [37] [55]\n\n\nElkhorn–Bennington–Blair, Nebraska/Modale, Iowa\nThis very large, violent, long-tracked tornado prompted the issuance of two tornado emergencies as it moved through the northwestern Omaha

region. The outbreak occurred over a period of four days, from April 25 to 28, 2024, and resulted in significant damage and loss of life.\n\n## Meteorological synopsis\n\nOn April 20, 2024, the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center (SPC) first delineated a severe weather risk for April 25–26, highlighting a zone extending from the Central Great Plains northeastward to the Midwestern U.S. The forecast was predicated on the development of thunderstorms downwind of an upper-tropospheric trough, where weather forecast models were depicting the advection of a moist airmass. The forecast was maintained through the next two days, with the risk area being expanded into northeastern Texas on April 22 and later extended to include the possibility of severe weather on April 27.\n\n## April 25\n\nOn the morning of April 25, the SPC predicted an enhanced risk of severe weather for parts of Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, highlighting the risk of tornadoes and large hail in connection with storms developing along a dry line between the Texas Panhandle and northwestern Kansas. This risk was later narrowed to two focal areas: one in northwestern Kansas associated with supercells during the afternoon and evening, and a second near the Red River, associated with an forecast cluster of storms during the overnight hours. During the afternoon, numerous thunderstorms developed near the dry line in eastern Colorado and near a low-pressure area in northeastern Colorado, southwestern Nebraska, and northwestern Kansas. These storms weakened during the evening upon moving northeastward into areas with less atmospheric instability, with the threat for tornadoes diminishing overnight. The SPC received six tornado reports from April 25 from states affected by these storms; five EFU tornadoes were confirmed.\n\n## April 26\n\nAnother cluster of thunderstorms developed in the Permian Basin of Texas in the early overnight hours into April 26, becoming and maintaining severe characteristics as they tracked northeast into the Red River Valley. This cluster eventually organized into a quasi-linear convective system over southern Oklahoma, potentially producing at least one tornado. The SPC received three reports of tornadoes from Oklahoma during the early morning hours of April 26; seven weak tornadoes were later confirmed in the state.\n\n## April 27–28\n\nIn the morning hours of April 27, the Storm Prediction Center issued a moderate risk (level 4) for central Oklahoma, north-central Texas, extreme southwestern Missouri, and southeastern Kansas. The moderate risk included a significant 15% tornado risk, a significant 30% wind risk, and a significant 45% hail risk. Multiple supercells formed that afternoon in northern Texas, western Oklahoma, southeastern Kansas, and northwestern Missouri. A 'particularly dangerous situation' (PDS) tornado watch was issued for western Oklahoma and northern Texas, warning of elevated probabilities for several tornadoes, some of which could be intense.\n\n## Confirmed tornadoes\n\nThis very large, violent, long-tracked tornado prompted the issuance of two tornado emergencies as it moved through the northwestern Omaha Metro. The tornado first touched down at 3:30 pm CDT south of West Q Road near the Platte River and traveled northeastward, damaging trees and farmstead outbuildings at EF0-EF1 intensity. The tornado then intensified to EF2 strength, damaging numerous homes, including one that was unroofed, overturned multiple center pivots in several acreages, and damaged outbuildings and a grain silo. The first of two tornado emergencies was issued for this tornado at that time as well; it would remain under this tag for essentially the rest of its existence. The tornado then weakened to EF1 intensity as it crossed L-28B, damaging a horse farm and a home, several trees, and other center pivots. As the tornado entered the western part of Omaha neighborhood of Elkhorn, it abruptly became violent and widened significantly, striking multiple subdivisions. Many homes in this area were severely damaged or destroyed, including some that were flattened. At least three homes were partially to complete swept away as well and metal building system was heavily damaged. The tornado also collapsed metal light poles near the Prospect Hill Cemetery, where several headstones were damaged, a landscaping business was damaged, and trees and wooden and steel power poles were snapped. Most of the most intense damage in the area was rated high-end EF3, but two small pockets of low-end EF4 damage were confirmed; both of these locations had homes that were partially to completely swept away with the first location also having debarked trees.\n\nElkhorn–Bennington–Blair, Nebraska/Modale, Iowa\n\nThis very large, violent, long-tracked tornado prompted the issuance of two tornado emergencies as it moved through the northwestern Omaha Metro.

It moved north-northeastward at high-end EF1 intensity, producing intermittent damage to the roofs of businesses, homes, and apartment buildings and snapping or uprooting trees. The tornado then crossed over I-29 and the Missouri River into the northeastern part of Omaha, Nebraska in Douglas County. As it moved onto the southeast side of the Eppley Airfield runway system, a local news tower cam captured the tornado live on video providing the first visual confirmation of the condensation funnel of the tornado reaching the ground. Initially, this was believed to be where the tornado first developed until further surveys confirmed that the tornado developed in Council Bluffs instead. The tornado strengthened to low-end EF2 intensity as it struck Eppley Airfield, leveling multiple unanchored aircraft hangars and flipping several general aviation airplanes. It also pulled a fire hydrant out of the ground and destroyed portions of the fencing that lined the airport.\n\nMinden–Tennant–Harlan–Defiance, Iowa\n\nThis very large multiple-vortex tornado touched down at 5:25 pm CDT in central Pottawattamie County, as another EF3 tornado to its west from the same supercell was dissipating. Roughly for the next ten minutes, the tornado maintained EF0 strength, with damage limited to trees and outbuildings. The tornado then began to rapidly intensify as it approached Minden from the southwest, destroying outbuildings and snapping trees at EF2 intensity. As it entered Minden at around 5:42 pm CDT, the tornado reached a width of just less than a half-mile as it impacted the southeast part of town. Several retail locations, as well as many homes in the area, were badly damaged or completely demolished. The tornado then rapidly intensified and reached its peak intensity in the far east side of Minden, where several poorly-anchored homes were completely destroyed and leveled at high-end EF3 intensity. Several large metal buildings along Main Street were also destroyed. One fatality and three injuries occurred in Minden. The tornado more or less maintained its intensity as it crossed Tamarack Road and exited Minden around 5:45 pm CDT, at which point a tornado emergency was issued for Minden and, later, points northeast. Several farmsteads and small homes in the area were damaged at EF2 or EF3 intensity. The tornado, around three-quarters of a mile wide, then crossed I-80, flipping a semi-truck, and produced a swath of vegetation and building damage to the north of the interstate along York Road.\n\nSulphur, Oklahoma\n\nThis catastrophic, intense tornado initially touched down in the Chickasaw National Recreation Area at 10:23 pm CDT in Murray County and moved north-northeastward, before turning rightward at a more northeasterly track.

A mobile home was damaged, a large tree had large limbs snapped, and other trees were snapped or uprooted.\n\nSpaulding–Holdenville–Bearden, Oklahoma\n\nThis very large, intense tornado touched down just south of Spaulding at 10:36 pm CDT. After inflicting minor EF0 damage to the roof of a home, the tornado moved due north into Spaulding at EF0 intensity, damaging trees and metal buildings. North of Spaulding, the tornado intensified to EF1 intensity and began to widen significantly, snapping trees and damaging power poles. As it turned due north and crossed Old US 270 west of Holdenville, the tornado heavily damaged outbuildings, inflicted minor roof damage to homes, and snapped more trees. Several more power poles were snapped along US 270 and trees were snapped. By this time, the tornado had grown to its peak width of 1,760 yd (1,610 m) (or 1 mi (1.6 km)) wide and a much larger area of uprooted trees along with damage to a metal building was noted.\n\nMarietta–Dickson–Baum, Oklahoma\n\nThis large, violent tornado developed southwest of Marietta in Love County along Red Oaks Road damaging trees and the roof of a home at EF0 strength. The tornado quickly intensified as it moved north-northeastward, snapping a power pole along Peanut Road at EF1 intensity before moving over Indian Trails Road at EF2 strength, where a home was unroofed, and trees were heavily damaged. Some other homes suffered minor to moderate roof damage as well. The tornado then intensified to EF3 intensity, inflicting heavy damage to a Dollar Tree Distribution Center facility. The facility was not reopened after the tornado ripped apart a large portion of the center of the structure, destroying the inventory stored there. The tornado then crossed over I-35, overturning a semi-truck on the freeway, and stubbing a tree. The driver of the truck was injured, while the passenger was killed. A gas station canopy at a truck stop was also damaged, and two tractor-trailers were tossed and stacked on top of each other. The tornado then became violent as it crossed over SH-32 and moved into the northwestern part of Marietta at low-end EF4 intensity. A Dollar General store was shredded with part of the structure collapsing and the next door Homeland grocery store was partially blown out when a large wall collapsed. Other structures, including outbuildings and a nursing home, were heavily damaged and trees were snapped. A large piece of debris from the area landed on I-35 after the tornado passed, narrowly missing a storm chaser on the interstate. Continuing north-northeastward, the tornado snapped trees at high-end EF2 intensity before exiting Marietta. The tornado then turned almost due north causing mainly EF1 damage to trees and power poles as it crossed US 77, although one home suffered EF2 roof damage.\n\n## Non-tornadic effects\n\nNumerous roads were forced to close as a result of flooding, including US 77, US 177, and US 266 in Oklahoma, as well as US 54, US 160, and US 400 in Kansas.\n\n## Flooding\n\nNumerous roads were forced to close as a result of flooding, including US 77, US 177, and US 266 in Oklahoma, as well as US 54, US 160, and US 400 in Kansas.\n\n## Aftermath\n\nOn April 26, a disaster declaration was declared in Pottawattamie County, including Minden, by Iowa governor Kim Reynolds.

He was a key figure in the development of American opera and was a pioneer in the field of talent management.\n\n**Early Life and Career in California**\n\nWinfield S Blake was born on July 4, 1868, in Pennsylvania. His family had previously lived in Denver, Colorado, where his father, Isaac E Blake, was the president of the Continental Oil Company (COC). Business interests for the COC in California brought the family to San Francisco, where Winfield's father invested millions of dollars in mining interests in The Needles region of the state.

A second letter written by Blake, which detailed efforts he made in conjunction with several supporters to establish a national movement and fundraising effort to support opera in America and more broadly resident American music institutions, appeared in the paper's June 23, 1897, issue.\n\n**Blake and Amber**\n\nIn 1902, Blake married the actress Maude Amber. Together, they formed a comedic duo known as Blake and Amber. The duo starred alongside Kolb and Dill and Barney Bernard in the vaudeville show Hurley Burly. They performed this work at Fischer's Theatre in San Francisco in 1902. The pair worked regularly at Fischer's Theatre for the next several years, often in collaboration with Kolb, Dill, and Bernard.\n\n**San Francisco Vaudeville**\n\nIn 1902, Blake married the actress Maude Amber.

That same year, they toured Australia and South Africa with Kolb, Dill, and Bernard in performances of Hoity Toity, Hurley Burly, and Fiddle-dee-dee. On their way to Australia, the group, billed as \"The American Travesty Stars,\" stopped in Hawaii for performances at the Orpheum Theatre in Honolulu in May and June 1904. Beginning in July 1904, the American Travesty Stars performed a season of works at the Palace Theatre, Sydney. After their final performance at that theatre in October 1904, the company went to Melbourne, where they performed the same season of works at the Melbourne Opera House in October-November 1904. In December 1904, the company performed at His Majesty's Theatre in Geelong, and then returned to Sydney for more performances at the Palace Theatre.\n\n**Return to Theatre in North America**\n\nIn December 1911, Blake and Amber returned to the United States after six years abroad. In 1912, the couple starred in variety programs at the Garrick Theatre in Wilmington, Delaware, the National Theatre in Boston, and at the Fifth Avenue Theatre on Broadway. They also worked in several vaudeville theaters in the United States and Canada, including Orpheum Circuit theaters in Reading, Pennsylvania, Altoona, Pennsylvania, and Montreal, Canada. In January 1913, they returned to San Francisco, performing at the Savoy Theatre. In February 1913, they starred alongside Kolb and Dill in a production of Victor Herbert's Algeria at the Grand Opera House in Santa Ana, California, and the Majestic Theatre in Los Angeles.\n\n**Later Life as Talent Managers and Costume Designers**\n\nIn the autumn of 1913, Blake applied for a booking agent's license with the intent of starting his own talent management firm. Soon after, he began managing vaudeville talent, sometimes writing material for the artists he managed. After this, Blake and Amber's appearances on the stage significantly diminished as their attentions became invested in this business venture. The firm, the Blake & Amber Booking Office of San Francisco, expanded outside of California in 1920 when it opened a second office in Salt Lake City with the intent of setting up a musical comedy \"touring wheel\" in which performers would appear in a theater circuit across California, Utah, Idaho, Montana, and Colorado.\n\n**Selected Works**\n\n* Falka (1895)\n* H.M.S.

[7] [8] She has two younger brothers, Hugh and Tony [9]\n\n\nWellesley College years\nIn 1965, Rodham enrolled at Wellesley College, where she majored in political science [21] [22] During her first year, she was president of the Wellesley Young Republicans [23] [24] As the leader of this \"Rockefeller Republican\"-oriented group, [25] she supported the elections of moderate Republicans John Lindsay to mayor of New York City and Massachusetts attorney general Edward Brooke to the United States Senate [26] She later stepped down from this position In 2003, Clinton would write that her views concerning the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War were changing in her early college years [23] In a letter to her youth minister at that time, she described herself as \"a mind conservative and a heart liberal\" [27] In contrast to the factions in the 1960s that advocated radical actions against the political system, she sought to work for change within it [28] [29]\n\n\nYale Law School and postgraduate studies\nRodham then entered Yale Law School, where she was on the editorial board of the Yale Review of Law and Social Action [43] During her second year, she worked at the Yale Child Study Center, [44] learning about new research on early childhood brain development and working as a research assistant on the seminal work, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1973) [45] [46] She also took on cases of child abuse at Yale–New Haven Hospital, [45] and volunteered at New Haven Legal Services to provide free legal advice for the poor [44] In the summer of 1970, she was awarded a grant to work at Marian Wright Edelman's Washington Research Project, where she was assigned to Senator Walter Mondale's Subcommittee on Migratory Labor There she researched various migrant workers' issues including education, health and housing [47] Edelman later became a significant mentor [48] Rodham was recruited by political advisor Anne Wexler to work on the 1970 campaign of Connecticut U.S Senate candidate Joseph Duffey Rodham later crediting Wexler with providing her first job in politics [49]\n\n\nMarriage, family, legal career and first ladyship of Arkansas\nDuring her postgraduate studies, Rodham was staff attorney for Edelman's newly founded Children's Defense Fund in Cambridge, Massachusetts, [62] and as a consultant to the Carnegie Council on Children [63] In 1974, she was a member of the impeachment inquiry staff in Washington, D.C., and advised the House Committee on the Judiciary during the Watergate scandal [64] The committee's work culminated with the resignation of President Richard Nixon in August 1974 [64]\n\n\nFrom the East Coast to Arkansas\nDuring her postgraduate studies, Rodham was staff attorney for Edelman's newly founded Children's Defense Fund in Cambridge, Massachusetts, [62] and as a consultant to the Carnegie Council on Children [63] In 1974, she was a member of the impeachment inquiry staff in Washington, D.C., and advised the House Committee on the Judiciary during the Watergate scandal [64] The committee's work culminated with the resignation of President Richard Nixon in August 1974 [64]\n\n\nEarly Arkansas years\nRodham became the first director of a new legal aid clinic at the University of Arkansas School of Law [73] During her time in Fayetteville, Rodham and several other women founded the city's first rape crisis center [73]\n\n\nLater Arkansas years\nTwo years after leaving office, Bill Clinton returned to the governorship of Arkansas after winning the election of 1982 During her husband's campaign, Hillary began to use the name \"Hillary Clinton\", or sometimes \"Mrs Bill Clinton\", to assuage the concerns of Arkansas voters; she also took a leave of absence from Rose Law to campaign for him full-time [97] During her second stint as the first lady of Arkansas, she made a point of using Hillary Rodham Clinton as her name [c]\n\n\nBill Clinton 1992 presidential campaign\nClinton received sustained national attention for the first time when her husband became a candidate for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination Before the New Hampshire primary, tabloid publications printed allegations that Bill Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers [122] In response, the Clintons appeared together on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied the affair, but acknowledged \"causing pain in my marriage\" [123] This joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign [124] During the campaign, Hillary made culturally disparaging remarks about Tammy Wynette's outlook on marriage as described in her classic song \"Stand by Your Man\" [d] Later in the campaign, she commented she could have chosen to be like women staying home and baking cookies and having teas, but wanted to pursue her career instead [e] The remarks were widely criticized, particularly by those who were, or defended, stay-at-home mothers In retrospect, she admitted they were ill-considered Bill said that in electing him, the nation would \"get two for the price of one\", referring to the prominent role his wife would assume [130] Beginning with Daniel Wattenberg's August 1992 The American Spectator article \"The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock\", Hillary's own past ideological and ethical record came under attack from conservatives [131] At least twenty other articles in major publications also drew comparisons between her and Lady Macbeth [132]\n\n\nFirst Lady of the United States (1993–2001)\nWhen Bill Clinton took office as president in January 1993, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the first lady Her press secretary reiterated she would be using that form of her name [c] She was the first in this role to have a postgraduate degree and her own professional career up to the time of entering the White House [133] She was also the first to have an office in the West Wing of the White House in addition to the usual first lady offices in the East Wing [57] [134] During the presidential transition, she was part of the innermost circle vetting appointments to the new administration Her choices filled at least eleven top-level positions and dozens more lower-level ones [135] [136] After Eleanor Roosevelt, Clinton was regarded as the most openly empowered presidential wife in American history [137] [138]\n\n\nHealth care and other policy initiatives\nIn January 1993, President Clinton named Hillary to chair a task force on National Health Care Reform, hoping to replicate the success she had in leading the effort for Arkansas education reform [140] The recommendation of the task force became known as the Clinton health care plan This was a comprehensive proposal that would require employers to provide health coverage to their employees through individual health maintenance organizations Its opponents quickly derided the plan as \"Hillarycare\" and it even faced opposition from some Democrats in Congress [141]\n\n\nInternational diplomacy and promotion of women's rights\nClinton traveled to 79 countries as first lady, [151] breaking the record for most-traveled first lady previously held by Pat Nixon [152] She did not hold a security clearance or attend National Security Council meetings, but played a role in U.S diplomacy attaining its objectives [153]\n\n\nScandals and investigations\nOne prominent investigation regarding Clinton was the Whitewater controversy, which arose out of real estate investments by the Clintons and associates made in the 1970s [160] [95] [160] As part of this investigation, on January 26, 1996, Clinton became the first spouse of a U.S president to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury [161] After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing [162]\n\n\nIt Takes a Village and other writings\nIn 1996, Clinton presented a vision for American children in the book It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us In January 1996, she went on a ten-city book tour and made numerous television appearances to promote the book, [170] although she was frequently hit with questions about her involvement in the Whitewater and Travelgate controversies [171] [172]\nThe book spent 18 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller List that year, including three weeks at number one [173] By 2000, it had sold 450,000 copies in hardcover and another 200,000 in paperback [174] Clinton received the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 1997 for the book's audio recording [175]\n\n\nResponse to Lewinsky scandal\nIn 1998, the Clintons' private concerns became the subject of much speculation when investigations revealed the president had engaged in an extramarital affair with 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky [179] Events surrounding the Lewinsky scandal eventually led to the impeachment of the president by the House of Representatives; he was later acquitted by the Senate When the allegations against her husband were first made public, Hillary Clinton stated that the allegations were part of a \"vast right-wing conspiracy\" [180] [181] Clinton characterized the Lewinsky charges as the latest in a long, organized, collaborative series of charges by Bill's political enemies [f] rather than any wrongdoing by her husband She later said she had been misled by his initial claims that no affair had taken place [183] After the evidence of President Clinton's encounters with Lewinsky became incontrovertible, she issued a public statement reaffirming her commitment to their marriage Privately, she was reported to be furious at him and was unsure if she wanted to remain in the marriage [184] The White House residence staff noticed a pronounced level of tension between the couple during this period [185]\n\n\nSave America's Treasures initiative\nClinton was the founding chair of Save America's Treasures, a nationwide effort matching federal funds with private donations to preserve and restore historic items and sites [187] This included the flag that inspired \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and the First Ladies National Historic Site in Canton, Ohio [57]\n\n\nTraditional duties\nClinton was the head of the White House Millennium Council [188] and hosted Millennium Evenings, [189] a series of lectures that discussed futures studies, one of which became the first live simultaneous webcast from the White House [57] Clinton also created the first White House Sculpture Garden, located in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden [190]\n\n\nU.S. Senate (2001–2009)\nWhen New York's long-serving U.S senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged Clinton to run for his open seat in the Senate election of 2000 [192] Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, north of New York City, in September 1999 [193] She became the first wife of the president of the United States to be a candidate for elected office [194] Initially, Clinton expected to face Rudy Giuliani—the mayor of New York City—as her Republican opponent in the election Giuliani withdrew from the race in May 2000 after being diagnosed with prostate cancer and matters related to his failing marriage became public Clinton then faced Rick Lazio, a Republican member of the U.S House of Representatives who represented New York's 2nd congressional district Throughout the campaign, opponents accused Clinton of carpetbagging, because she had never resided in New York State or participated in the state's politics before the 2000 Senate race [195]\n\n\n2000 U.S. Senate election\nWhen New York's long-serving U.S senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged Clinton to run for his open seat in the Senate election of 2000 [192] Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, north of New York City, in September 1999 [193] She became the first wife of the president of the United States to be a candidate for elected office [194] Initially, Clinton expected to face Rudy Giuliani—the mayor of New York City—as her Republican opponent in the election Giuliani withdrew from the race in May 2000 after being diagnosed with prostate cancer and matters related to his failing marriage became public Clinton then faced Rick Lazio, a Republican member of the U.S House of Representatives who represented New York's 2nd congressional district Throughout the campaign, opponents accused Clinton of carpetbagging, because she had never resided in New York State or participated in the state's politics before the 2000 Senate race [195]\n\n\nFirst term\nBecause Bill Clinton's term as president did not end until 17 days after she was sworn in, upon entering the Senate, Clinton became the first and so far only first lady to serve as a senator and first lady concurrently Clinton maintained a low public profile and built relationships with senators from both parties when she started her term [201] She forged alliances with religiously inclined senators by becoming a regular participant in the Senate Prayer Breakfast [202] [203] She sat on five Senate committees: Committee on Budget (2001–02), [204] Committee on Armed Services (2003–09), [205] Committee on Environment and Public Works (2001–09), Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (2001–09) [204] and Special Committee on Aging [206]\nShe was also a member of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe [207] (2001–09) [208]\n\n\n2006 reelection campaign\nIn November 2004, Clinton announced she would seek a second Senate term She easily won the Democratic nomination over opposition from antiwar activist Jonathan Tasini [234] [235] The early frontrunner for the Republican nomination, Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, withdrew from the contest after several months of poor campaign performance [236] Clinton's eventual opponent in the general election was Republican candidate John Spencer, a former mayor of Yonkers Clinton won the election on November 7, 2006, with 67 percent of the vote to Spencer's 31 percent, [237] carrying all but four of New York's sixty-two counties [238] Her campaign spent $36 million for her reelection, more than any other candidate for Senate in the 2006 elections Some Democrats criticized her for spending too much in a one-sided contest, while some supporters were concerned she did not leave more funds for a potential presidential bid in 2008 [239] In the following months, she transferred $10 million of her Senate funds toward her presidential campaign [240]\n\n\nSecond term\nClinton opposed the Iraq War troop surge of 2007, for both military and domestic political reasons (by the following year, she was privately acknowledging the surge had been successful) [g] In March of that year, she voted in favor of a war-spending bill that required President Bush to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq by a deadline; it passed almost completely along party lines [242] but was subsequently vetoed by Bush In May, a compromise war funding bill that removed withdrawal deadlines but tied funding to progress benchmarks for the Iraqi government passed the Senate by a vote of 80–14 and would be signed by Bush; Clinton was one of those who voted against it [243] She responded to General David Petraeus's September 2007 Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq by saying, \"I think that the reports that you provide to us really require a willing suspension of disbelief.\" [244]\n\n\n2008 presidential campaign\nClinton had been preparing for a potential candidacy for U.S president since at least early 2003 [249] On January 20, 2007, she announced via her website the formation of a presidential exploratory committee for the United States presidential election of 2008, stating: \"I'm in and I'm in to win.\" [250] No woman had ever been nominated by a major party for the presidency, and no first lady had ever run for president.\nWhen Bill Clinton became president in 1993, a blind trust was established; in April 2007, the Clintons liquidated the blind trust to avoid the possibility of ethical conflicts or political embarrassments as Hillary undertook her presidential race Later disclosure statements revealed the couple's worth was now upwards of $50 million [251] They had earned over $100 million since 2000—most of it coming from Bill's books, speaking engagements and other activities [252]\n\n\nSecretary of State (2009–2013)\nIn mid-November 2008, President-elect Obama and Clinton discussed the possibility of her serving as secretary of state in his administration [281] She was initially quite reluctant, but on November 20 she told Obama she would accept the position [282] [283] On December 1, President-elect Obama formally announced that Clinton would be his nominee for secretary of state [284] [285] Clinton said she did not want to leave the Senate, but that the new position represented a \"difficult and exciting adventure\" [285] As part of the nomination and to relieve concerns of conflict of interest, Bill Clinton agreed to accept several conditions and restrictions regarding his ongoing activities and fundraising efforts for the William J Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative [286]\n\n\nNomination and confirmation\nIn mid-November 2008, President-elect Obama and Clinton discussed the possibility of her serving as secretary of state in his administration [281] She was initially quite reluctant, but on November 20 she told Obama she would accept the position [282] [283] On December 1, President-elect Obama formally announced that Clinton would be his nominee for secretary of state [284] [285] Clinton said she did not want to leave the Senate, but that the new position represented a \"difficult and exciting adventure\" [285] As part of the nomination and to relieve concerns of conflict of interest, Bill Clinton agreed to accept several conditions and restrictions regarding his ongoing activities and fundraising efforts for the William J Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative [286]\n\n\nTenure\nDuring her tenure as secretary of state, Clinton and President Obama forged a positive working relationship that lacked power struggles Clinton was regarded to be a team player within the Obama administration She was also considered a defender of the administration to the public She was regarded to be cautious to prevent herself or her husband from upstaging the president [293] [294] Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise [282] Clinton met with Obama weekly, but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents [294] Nevertheless, Obama was trusting of Clinton's actions [282] Clinton also formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates with whom she shared similar strategic outlooks [295]\n\n\nOverall themes\nThroughout her time in office (and mentioned in her final speech concluding it), Clinton viewed \"smart power\" as the strategy for asserting U.S leadership and values In a world of varied threats, weakened central governments and increasingly important nongovernmental entities, smart power combined military hard power with diplomacy and U.S soft power capacities in global economics, development aid, technology, creativity and human rights advocacy [317] [343] As such, she became the first secretary of state to methodically implement the smart power approach [344] In debates over use of military force, she was generally one of the more hawkish voices in the administration [220] [295] [327] In August 2011 she hailed the ongoing multinational military intervention in Libya and the initial U.S response towards the Syrian Civil War as examples of smart power in action [345]\n\n\nBenghazi attack and subsequent hearings\nOn September 11, 2012, the U.S diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked, resulting in the deaths of the U.S Ambassador, J Christopher Stevens and three other Americans The attack, questions surrounding the security of the U.S consulate, and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials for what had happened became politically controversial in the U.S [357] On October 15, Clinton took responsibility for the question of security lapses saying the differing explanations were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after such events [357] [358]\n\n\nEmail controversy\nDuring her tenure as secretary of state, Clinton conducted official business exclusively through her private email server, as opposed to her government email account [372] Some experts, officials, members of Congress and political opponents contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures, and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements The controversy occurred against the backdrop of Clinton's 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select Committee on Benghazi [373] [374]\n\n\nClinton Foundation, Hard Choices, and speeches\nWhen Clinton left the State Department, she returned to private life for the first time in thirty years [391] She and her daughter joined her husband as named members of the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013 [392] There she focused on early childhood development efforts, including an initiative called Too Small to Fail and a $600 million initiative to encourage the enrollment of girls in secondary schools worldwide, led by former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard [392] [393]\n\n\n2016 presidential campaign\nOn April 12, 2015, Clinton formally announced her candidacy for the presidency in the 2016 election [404] She had a campaign-in-waiting already in place, including a large donor network, experienced operatives and the Ready for Hillary and Priorities USA Action political action committees and other infrastructure [405] Prior to her campaign, Clinton had claimed in an interview on NDTV in May 2012 that she would not seek the presidency again, but later wrote in her 2014 autobiography Hard Choices that she had not decided [406] [407] The campaign's headquarters were established in the New York City borough of Brooklyn [408] Her campaign focused on: raising middle class incomes, establishing universal preschool, making college more affordable and improving the Affordable Care Act [409] [410] Initially considered a prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination, [404] Clinton faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from democratic socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont His longtime stance against the influence of corporations and the wealthy in American politics resonated with a dissatisfied citizenry troubled by the effects of income inequality in the U.S and contrasted with Clinton's Wall Street ties [400] [410]\n\n\nPost–2016 election activities\nClinton maintained a low profile in the months following her defeat in the 2016 presidential election [448] She frequently engaged in nature walks in Chappaqua, with various sightings of Clinton circulating on social media [449] On January 20, 2017, she attended the inauguration of Donald Trump [450] On her decision to attend, Clinton stated: \"I'm here today to honor our democracy & its enduring values, I will never stop believing in our country & its future.\" [451] Clinton also began work on a book of personal essays, in which she would reflect on her defeat in the election [452] The book, What Happened, was released on September 12, 2017, alongside a picture book adaption of It Takes a Village [453] [454]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nUsing her Senate votes, several organizations have attempted to measure Clinton's place on the political spectrum scientifically National Journal's 2004 study of roll-call votes assigned Clinton a rating of 30 on the political spectrum, relative to the Senate at the time, with a rating of 1 being most liberal and 100 being most conservative [478] National Journal's subsequent rankings placed her as the 32nd-most liberal senator in 2006 and 16th-most liberal senator in 2007 [479] A 2004 analysis by political scientists Joshua D Clinton of Princeton University and Simon Jackman and Doug Rivers of Stanford University found her likely to be the sixth-to-eighth-most liberal senator [480] The Almanac of American Politics, edited by Michael Barone and Richard E Cohen, rated her votes from 2003 through 2006 as liberal on economics, social issues, and foreign policy [n] According to FiveThirtyEight's measure of political ideology, \"Clinton was one of the most liberal members during her time in the Senate.\" [481]\n\n\nEconomics\nIn March 2016, Clinton laid out a detailed economic plan, which The New York Times called \"optimistic\" and \"wide-ranging\" Basing her economic philosophy on inclusive capitalism, Clinton proposed a \"clawback\" that would rescind tax relief and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas; providing incentives for companies that share profits with employees, communities and the environment, rather than focusing on short-term profits to increase stock value and rewarding shareholders; increasing collective bargaining rights; and placing an \"exit tax\" on companies that move their headquarters out of America to pay a lower tax rate overseas [484]\n\n\nDomestic policy\nClinton accepts the scientific consensus on climate change and supports cap-and-trade, [485] and opposed the Keystone XL pipeline [486] She supported \"equal pay for equal work\", to address current shortfalls in how much women are paid to do the same jobs men do [487] Clinton has explicitly focused on family issues and supports universal preschool [488] These programs would be funded by proposing tax increases on the wealthy, including a \"fair share surcharge\" [489] Clinton supported the Affordable Care Act [490] and would have added a \"public option\" that competed with private insurers and enabled people \"50 or 55 and up\" to buy into Medicare [491] [492]\n\n\nLGBT rights\nClinton supports the right to same-sex marriage, a position that has developed throughout her political career [488] In 2000, she was against such marriages altogether In 2006, she said only that she would support a state's decision to permit same-sex marriages, but opposed federally amending the Constitution to permit same-sex marriage While running for president in 2007, she again reiterated her opposition to same-sex marriage, although she expressed her support of civil unions [493] [494] 2013 marked the first time that Clinton expressed support for a national right to same-sex marriage [494] In 2016, she was the first major-party presidential candidate ever to write an op-ed for an LGBT newspaper, the Philadelphia Gay News [495]\n\n\nImmigration\nClinton held that allowing undocumented immigrants to have a path to citizenship \" [i]s at its heart a family issue\", [496] and expressed support for Obama's Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) program, which would allow up to five million undocumented immigrants to gain deferral of deportation and authorization to legally work in the United States [497] [498] However, in 2014, Clinton stated that unaccompanied children crossing the border \"should be sent back.\" [499] She opposed and criticized Trump's call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States [500]\n\n\nForeign policy\nOn foreign affairs, Clinton voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq in October 2002, [501] a vote she later said she regretted [502] She favored arming Syria's rebel fighters in 2012 and has called for the removal of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad [503] She supported the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 and the NATO-led military intervention in Libya to oust former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 [504] [505] Clinton is in favor of maintaining American influence in the Middle East [500] She has told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, \"America can't ever be neutral when it comes to Israel's security and survival.\" [506] Clinton expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the 2006 Lebanon War and 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict [507] [508] In a 2017 interview, after a poison gas attack in Syria, Clinton said that she had favored more aggressive action against Bashar al-Assad: \"I think we should have been more willing to confront Assad I really believe we should have and still should take out his air fields and prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them.\" [509] Clinton opposed a ceasefire in the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, [510] stating \"Remember, there was a ceasefire on October 6, that Hamas broke by their barbaric assault on peaceful civilians.\" [511]\n\n\nReligious views\nClinton has been a lifelong Methodist, and has been part of United Methodist Church congregations throughout her life She has publicly discussed her Christian faith on several occasions, although seldom while campaigning [512] [513] Professor Paul Kengor, author of God and Hillary Clinton: A Spiritual Life, has suggested that Clinton's political positions are rooted in her faith She often expresses a maxim often attributed to John Wesley: \"Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can.\" [512]\n\n\nCultural and political image\nOver a hundred books and scholarly works have been written about Clinton A 2006 survey by the New York Observer found \"a virtual cottage industry\" of \"anti-Clinton literature\" put out by Regnery Publishing and other conservative imprints Some titles include Madame Hillary: The Dark Road to the White House, Hillary's Scheme: Inside the Next Clinton's Ruthless Agenda to Take the White House and Can She Be Stopped?: Hillary Clinton Will Be the Next President of the United States Unless .. Books praising Clinton did not sell nearly as well [514] (other than her memoirs and those of her husband) When she ran for Senate in 2000, several fundraising groups such as Save Our Senate and the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton sprang up to oppose her [515] Don Van Natta found that Republican and conservative groups viewed her as a reliable \"bogeyman\" to mention in fundraising letters, on a par with Ted Kennedy, and the equivalent of Democratic and liberal appeals mentioning Newt Gingrich [516]\n\n\nBooks\n\n\nAncestry\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\nOfficial\n\n\nMedia coverage\n\n\nOther\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Hillary Clinton**\n\nHillary Diane Rodham Clinton is an American politician, diplomat, lawyer, writer, and public speaker who served as the First Lady of the United States from 1993 to 2001, a United States Senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, and the 67th United States Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013.

She was raised in a Methodist family who first lived in Chicago. When she was three years old, her family moved to the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge. Her father, Hugh Rodham, was of English and Welsh descent, and managed a small but successful textile business, which he had founded. Her mother, Dorothy Howell, was a homemaker of Dutch, English, French Canadian (from Quebec), Scottish, and Welsh descent. She has two younger brothers, Hugh and Tony.\n\n**Wellesley College Years**\n\nIn 1965, Rodham enrolled at Wellesley College, where she majored in political science. During her first year, she was president of the Wellesley Young Republicans. As the leader of this \"Rockefeller Republican\"-oriented group, she supported the elections of moderate Republicans John Lindsay to mayor of New York City and Massachusetts attorney general Edward Brooke to the United States Senate. She later stepped down from this position.\n\n**Yale Law School and Postgraduate Studies**\n\nRodham then entered Yale Law School, where she was on the editorial board of the Yale Review of Law and Social Action. During her second year, she worked at the Yale Child Study Center, learning about new research on early childhood brain development and working as a research assistant on the seminal work, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1973). She also took on cases of child abuse at Yale–New Haven Hospital and volunteered at New Haven Legal Services to provide free legal advice for the poor.\n\n**Marriage, Family, Legal Career, and First Ladyship of Arkansas**\n\nDuring her postgraduate studies, Rodham was staff attorney for Edelman's newly founded Children's Defense Fund in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and as a consultant to the Carnegie Council on Children.

During her time in Fayetteville, Rodham and several other women founded the city's first rape crisis center.\n\n**Later Arkansas Years**\n\nTwo years after leaving office, Bill Clinton returned to the governorship of Arkansas after winning the election of 1982. During her husband's campaign, Hillary began to use the name \"Hillary Clinton,\" or sometimes \"Mrs Bill Clinton,\" to assuage the concerns of Arkansas voters; she also took a leave of absence from Rose Law to campaign for him full-time.\n\n**Bill Clinton 1992 Presidential Campaign**\n\nClinton received sustained national attention for the first time when her husband became a candidate for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Before the New Hampshire primary, tabloid publications printed allegations that Bill Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers. In response, the Clintons appeared together on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied the affair, but acknowledged \"causing pain in my marriage.\" This joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign.\n\n**First Lady of the United States (1993-2001)**\n\nWhen Bill Clinton took office as president in January 1993, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the first lady. She was the first in this role to have a postgraduate degree and her own professional career up to the time of entering the White House. She was also the first to have an office in the West Wing of the White House in addition to the usual first lady offices in the East Wing.\n\n**Health Care and Other Policy Initiatives**\n\nIn January 1993, President Clinton named Hillary to chair a task force on National Health Care Reform, hoping to replicate the success she had in leading the effort for Arkansas education reform. The recommendation of the task force became known as the Clinton health care plan. This was a comprehensive proposal that would require employers to provide health coverage to their employees through individual health maintenance organizations.\n\n**International Diplomacy and Promotion of Women's Rights**\n\nClinton traveled to 79 countries as first lady, breaking the record for most-traveled first lady previously held by Pat Nixon. She did not hold a security clearance or attend National Security Council meetings, but played a role in U.S diplomacy attaining its objectives.\n\n**Scandals and Investigations**\n\nOne prominent investigation regarding Clinton was the Whitewater controversy, which arose out of real estate investments by the Clintons and associates made in the 1970s.

The book spent 18 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller List that year, including three weeks at number one.\n\n**Response to Lewinsky Scandal**\n\nIn 1998, the Clintons' private concerns became the subject of much speculation when investigations revealed the president had engaged in an extramarital affair with 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Events surrounding the Lewinsky scandal eventually led to the impeachment of the president by the House of Representatives; he was later acquitted by the Senate.\n\n**Save America's Treasures Initiative**\n\nClinton was the founding chair of Save America's Treasures, a nationwide effort matching federal funds with private donations to preserve and restore historic items and sites. This included the flag that inspired \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and the First Ladies National Historic Site in Canton, Ohio.\n\n**U.S Senate (2001-2009)**\n\nWhen New York's long-serving U.S senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged Clinton to run for his open seat in the Senate election of 2000. Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, north of New York City, in September 1999.\n\n**2000 U.S Senate Election**\n\nIn the 2000 U.S Senate election, Clinton won the Democratic nomination over opposition from antiwar activist Jonathan Tasini. The early frontrunner for the Republican nomination, Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, withdrew from the contest after several months of poor campaign performance. Clinton's eventual opponent in the general election was Republican candidate John Spencer, a former mayor of Yonkers.\n\n**2006 Re-Election Campaign**\n\nIn November 2004, Clinton announced she would seek a second Senate term. She easily won the Democratic nomination over opposition from Tasini. The early frontrunner for the Republican nomination, Pirro, withdrew from the contest after several months of poor campaign performance. Clinton's eventual opponent in the general election was Republican candidate John Spencer.\n\n**Second Term**\n\nClinton opposed the Iraq War troop surge of 2007, for both military and domestic political reasons. In March of that year, she voted in favor of a war-spending bill that required President Bush to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq by a deadline; it passed almost completely along party lines but was subsequently vetoed by Bush.\n\n**2008 Presidential Campaign**\n\nClinton had been preparing for a potential candidacy for U.S president since at least early 2003. On January 20, 2007, she announced via her website the formation of a presidential exploratory committee for the United States presidential election of 2008, stating: \"I'm in and I'm in to win.\"\n\n**Secretary of State (2009-2013)**\n\nIn mid-November 2008, President-elect Obama and Clinton discussed the possibility of her serving as secretary of state in his administration.

She was cautious to prevent herself or her husband from upstaging the president.\n\n**Email Controversy**\n\nDuring her tenure as secretary of state, Clinton conducted official business exclusively through her private email server, as opposed to her government email account. This became a major controversy during her 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n**Post-2016 Election Activities**\n\nClinton maintained a low profile in the months following her defeat in the 2016 presidential election. She frequently engaged in nature walks in Chappaqua, with various sightings of Clinton circulating on social media. On January 20, 2017, she attended the inauguration of Donald Trump.\n\n**What Happened**\n\nIn 2017, Clinton released a book of personal essays, in which she would reflect on her defeat in the election.

defended, stay-at-home mothers In retrospect, she admitted they were ill-considered Bill said that in electing him, the nation would \"get two for the price of one\", referring to the prominent role his wife would assume [130] Beginning with Daniel Wattenberg's August 1992 The American Spectator article \"The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock\", Hillary's own past ideological and ethical record came

a federal grand jury [161] After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing [162]\n\n\nIt Takes a Village and other writings\nIn 1996, Clinton presented a vision for American children in the book It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us In January 1996, she went on a ten-city book tour and made numerous television appearances to promote the book, [170] although she was frequently hit with questions about her involvement in the Whitewater and Travelgate controversies [171] [172]\nThe book spent 18 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller List that year, including three weeks at number one [173] By 2000, it had sold 450,000 copies in hardcover and another 200,000 in paperback [174] Clinton received the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 1997 for the book's audio recording [175]\n\n\nResponse to Lewinsky scandal\nIn 1998, the Clintons' private concerns became the subject of much speculation when investigations revealed the president had engaged in an extramarital affair with 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky [179] Events surrounding the Lewinsky scandal eventually led to the impeachment of the president by the House of Representatives; he was later acquitted by the Senate When the allegations against her husband were first made public, Hillary Clinton stated that the allegations were part of a \"vast right-wing conspiracy\" [180] [181] Clinton characterized the Lewinsky charges as the latest in a long, organized, collaborative series of charges by Bill's political enemies [f] rather than any wrongdoing by her husband She later said she had been misled by his initial claims that no affair had taken place [183] After the evidence of President Clinton's encounters with Lewinsky became incontrovertible, she issued a public statement reaffirming her commitment to their marriage Privately, she was reported to be furious at him and was unsure if she wanted to remain in the marriage [184] The White House residence staff noticed a pronounced level of tension between the couple during this period [185]\n\n\nSave America's Treasures initiative\nClinton was the founding chair of Save America's Treasures, a nationwide effort matching federal funds with private donations to preserve and restore historic items and sites [187] This included the flag that inspired \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and the First Ladies National Historic Site in Canton, Ohio [57]\n\n\nTraditional duties\nClinton was the head of the White House Millennium Council [188] and hosted Millennium Evenings, [189] a series of lectures that discussed futures studies, one of which became the first live simultaneous webcast from the White House [57] Clinton also created the first White House Sculpture Garden, located in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden [190]\n\n\nU.S. Senate (2001–2009)\nWhen New York's long-serving U.S senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged Clinton to run for his open seat in the Senate election of 2000 [192] Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, north of New York City, in September 1999 [193] She became the first wife of the president of the United States to be a candidate for elected office [194] Initially, Clinton expected to face Rudy Giuliani—the mayor of New York City—as her Republican opponent in the election Giuliani withdrew from the race in May 2000 after being diagnosed with prostate cancer and matters related to his failing marriage became public Clinton then faced Rick Lazio, a Republican member of the U.S House of Representatives who represented New York's 2nd congressional district Throughout the campaign, opponents accused Clinton of carpetbagging, because she had never resided in New York State or participated in the state's politics before the 2000 Senate race [195]\n\n\n2000 U.S. Senate election\nWhen New York's long-serving U.S senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged Clinton to run for his open seat in the Senate election of 2000 [192] Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, north of New York City, in September 1999 [193] She became the first wife of the president of the United States to be a candidate for elected office [194] Initially, Clinton expected to face Rudy Giuliani—the mayor of New York City—as her Republican opponent in the election Giuliani withdrew from the race in May 2000 after being diagnosed with prostate cancer and matters related to his failing marriage became public Clinton then faced Rick Lazio, a Republican member of the U.S House of Representatives who represented New York's 2nd congressional district Throughout the campaign, opponents accused Clinton of carpetbagging, because she had never resided in New York State or participated in the state's politics before the 2000 Senate race [195]\n\n\nFirst term\nBecause Bill Clinton's term as president did not end until 17 days after she was sworn in, upon entering the Senate, Clinton became the first and so far only first lady to serve as a senator and first lady concurrently Clinton maintained a low public profile and built relationships with senators from both parties when she started her term [201] She forged alliances with religiously inclined senators by becoming a regular participant in the Senate Prayer Breakfast [202] [203] She sat on five Senate committees: Committee on Budget (2001–02), [204] Committee on Armed Services (2003–09), [205] Committee on Environment and Public Works (2001–09), Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (2001–09) [204] and Special Committee on Aging [206]\nShe was also a member of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe [207] (2001–09) [208]\n\n\n2006 reelection campaign\nIn November 2004, Clinton announced she would seek a second Senate term She easily won the Democratic nomination over opposition from antiwar activist Jonathan Tasini [234] [235] The early frontrunner for the Republican nomination, Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, withdrew from the contest after several months of poor campaign performance [236] Clinton's eventual opponent in the general election was Republican candidate John Spencer, a former mayor of Yonkers Clinton won the election on November 7, 2006, with 67 percent of the vote to Spencer's 31 percent, [237] carrying all but four of New York's sixty-two counties [238] Her campaign spent $36 million for her reelection, more than any other candidate for Senate in the 2006 elections Some Democrats criticized her for spending too much in a one-sided contest, while some supporters were concerned she did not leave more funds for a potential presidential bid in 2008 [239] In the following months, she transferred $10 million of her Senate funds toward her presidential campaign [240]\n\n\nSecond term\nClinton opposed the Iraq War troop surge of 2007, for both military and domestic political reasons (by the following year, she was privately acknowledging the surge had been successful) [g] In March of that year, she voted in favor of a war-spending bill that required President Bush to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq by a deadline; it passed almost completely along party lines [242] but was subsequently vetoed by Bush In May, a compromise war funding bill that removed withdrawal deadlines but tied funding to progress benchmarks for the Iraqi government passed the Senate by a vote of 80–14 and would be signed by Bush; Clinton was one of those who voted against it [243] She responded to General David Petraeus's September 2007 Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq by saying, \"I think that the reports that you provide to us really require a willing suspension of disbelief.\" [244]\n\n\n2008 presidential campaign\nClinton had been preparing for a potential candidacy for U.S president since at least early 2003 [249] On January 20, 2007, she announced via her website the formation of a presidential exploratory committee for the United States presidential election of 2008, stating: \"I'm in and I'm in to win.\" [250] No woman had ever been nominated by a major party for the presidency, and no first lady had ever run for president.\nWhen Bill Clinton became president in 1993, a blind trust was established; in April 2007, the Clintons liquidated the blind trust to avoid the possibility of ethical conflicts or political embarrassments as Hillary undertook her presidential race Later disclosure statements revealed the couple's worth was now upwards of $50 million [251] They had earned over $100 million since 2000—most of it coming from Bill's books, speaking engagements and other activities [252]\n\n\nSecretary of State (2009–2013)\nIn mid-November 2008, President-elect Obama and Clinton discussed the possibility of her serving as secretary of state in his administration [281] She was initially quite reluctant, but on November 20 she told Obama she would accept the position [282] [283] On December 1, President-elect Obama formally announced that Clinton would be his nominee for secretary of state [284] [285] Clinton said she did not want to leave the Senate, but that the new position represented a \"difficult and exciting adventure\" [285] As part of the nomination and to relieve concerns of conflict of interest, Bill Clinton agreed to accept several conditions and restrictions regarding his ongoing activities and fundraising efforts for the William J Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative [286]\n\n\nNomination and confirmation\nIn mid-November 2008, President-elect Obama and Clinton discussed the possibility of her serving as secretary of state in his administration [281] She was initially quite reluctant, but on November 20 she told Obama she would accept the position [282] [283] On December 1, President-elect Obama formally announced that Clinton would be his nominee for secretary of state [284] [285] Clinton said she did not want to leave the Senate, but that the new position represented a \"difficult and exciting adventure\" [285] As part of the nomination and to relieve concerns of conflict of interest, Bill Clinton agreed to accept several conditions and restrictions regarding his ongoing activities and fundraising efforts for the William J Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative [286]\n\n\nTenure\nDuring her tenure as secretary of state, Clinton and President Obama forged a positive working relationship that lacked power struggles Clinton was regarded to be a team player within the Obama administration She was also considered a defender of the administration to the public She was regarded to be cautious to prevent herself or her husband from upstaging the president [293] [294] Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise [282] Clinton met with Obama weekly, but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents [294] Nevertheless, Obama was trusting of Clinton's actions [282] Clinton also formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates with whom she shared similar strategic outlooks [295]\n\n\nOverall themes\nThroughout her time in office (and mentioned in her final speech concluding it), Clinton viewed \"smart power\" as the strategy for asserting U.S leadership and values In a world of varied threats, weakened central governments and increasingly important nongovernmental entities, smart power combined military hard power with diplomacy and U.S soft power capacities in global economics, development aid, technology, creativity and human rights advocacy [317] [343] As such, she became the first secretary of state to methodically implement the smart power approach [344] In debates over use of military force, she was generally one of the more hawkish voices in the administration [220] [295] [327] In August 2011 she hailed the ongoing multinational military intervention in Libya and the initial U.S response towards the Syrian Civil War as examples of smart power in action [345]\n\n\nBenghazi attack and subsequent hearings\nOn September 11, 2012, the U.S diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked, resulting in the deaths of the U.S Ambassador, J Christopher Stevens and three other Americans The attack, questions surrounding the security of the U.S consulate, and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials for what had happened became politically controversial in the U.S [357] On October 15, Clinton took responsibility for the question of security lapses saying the differing explanations were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after such events [357] [358]\n\n\nEmail controversy\nDuring her tenure as secretary of state, Clinton conducted official business exclusively through her private email server, as opposed to her government email account [372] Some experts, officials, members of Congress and political opponents contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures, and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements The controversy occurred against the backdrop of Clinton's 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select Committee on Benghazi [373] [374]\n\n\nClinton Foundation, Hard Choices, and speeches\nWhen Clinton left the State Department, she returned to private life for the first time in thirty years [391] She and her daughter joined her husband as named members of the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013 [392] There she focused on early childhood development efforts, including an initiative called Too Small to Fail and a $600 million initiative to encourage the enrollment of girls in secondary schools worldwide, led by former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard [392] [393]\n\n\n2016 presidential campaign\nOn April 12, 2015, Clinton formally announced her candidacy for the presidency in the 2016 election [404] She had a campaign-in-waiting already in place, including a large donor network, experienced operatives and the Ready for Hillary and Priorities USA Action political action committees and other infrastructure [405] Prior to her campaign, Clinton had claimed in an interview on NDTV in May 2012 that she would not seek the presidency again, but later wrote in her 2014 autobiography Hard Choices that she had not decided [406] [407] The campaign's headquarters were established in the New York City borough of Brooklyn [408] Her campaign focused on: raising middle class incomes, establishing universal preschool, making college more affordable and improving the Affordable Care Act [409] [410] Initially considered a prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination, [404] Clinton faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from democratic socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont His longtime stance against the influence of corporations and the wealthy in American politics resonated with a dissatisfied citizenry troubled by the effects of income inequality in the U.S and contrasted with Clinton's Wall Street ties [400] [410]\n\n\nPost–2016 election activities\nClinton maintained a low profile in the months following her defeat in the 2016 presidential election [448] She frequently engaged in nature walks in Chappaqua, with various sightings of Clinton circulating on social media [449] On January 20, 2017, she attended the inauguration of Donald Trump [450] On her decision to attend, Clinton stated: \"I'm here today to honor our democracy & its enduring values, I will never stop believing in our country & its future.\" [451] Clinton also began work on a book of personal essays, in which she would reflect on her defeat in the election [452] The book, What Happened, was released on September 12, 2017, alongside a picture book adaption of It Takes a Village [453] [454]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nUsing her Senate votes, several organizations have attempted to measure Clinton's place on the political spectrum scientifically National Journal's 2004 study of roll-call votes assigned Clinton a rating of 30 on the political spectrum, relative to the Senate at the time, with a rating of 1 being most liberal and 100 being most conservative [478] National Journal's subsequent rankings placed her as the 32nd-most liberal senator in 2006 and 16th-most liberal senator in 2007 [479] A 2004 analysis by political scientists Joshua D Clinton of Princeton University and Simon Jackman and Doug Rivers of Stanford University found her likely to be the sixth-to-eighth-most liberal senator [480] The Almanac of American Politics, edited by Michael Barone and Richard E Cohen, rated her votes from 2003 through 2006 as liberal on economics, social issues, and foreign policy [n] According to FiveThirtyEight's measure of political ideology, \"Clinton was one of the most liberal members during her time in the Senate.\" [481]\n\n\nEconomics\nIn March 2016, Clinton laid out a detailed economic plan, which The New York Times called \"optimistic\" and \"wide-ranging\" Basing her economic philosophy on inclusive capitalism, Clinton proposed a \"clawback\" that would rescind tax relief and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas; providing incentives for companies that share profits with employees, communities and the environment, rather than focusing on short-term profits to increase stock value and rewarding shareholders; increasing collective bargaining rights; and placing an \"exit tax\" on companies that move their headquarters out of America to pay a lower tax rate overseas [484]\n\n\nDomestic policy\nClinton accepts the scientific consensus on climate change and supports cap-and-trade, [485] and opposed the Keystone XL pipeline [486] She supported \"equal pay for equal work\", to address current shortfalls in how much women are paid to do the same jobs men do [487] Clinton has explicitly focused on family issues and supports universal preschool [488] These programs would be funded by proposing tax increases on the wealthy, including a \"fair share surcharge\" [489] Clinton supported the Affordable Care Act [490] and would have added a \"public option\" that competed with private insurers and enabled people \"50 or 55 and up\" to buy into Medicare [491] [492]\n\n\nLGBT rights\nClinton supports the right to same-sex marriage, a position that has developed throughout her political career [488] In 2000, she was against such marriages altogether In 2006, she said only that she would support a state's decision to permit same-sex marriages, but opposed federally amending the Constitution to permit same-sex marriage While running for president in 2007, she again reiterated her opposition to same-sex marriage, although she expressed her support of civil unions [493] [494] 2013 marked the first time that Clinton expressed support for a national right to same-sex marriage [494] In 2016, she was the first major-party presidential candidate ever to write an op-ed for an LGBT newspaper, the Philadelphia Gay News [495]\n\n\nImmigration\nClinton held that allowing undocumented immigrants to have a path to citizenship \" [i]s at its heart a family issue\", [496] and expressed support for Obama's Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) program, which would allow up to five million undocumented immigrants to gain deferral of deportation and authorization to legally work in the United States [497] [498] However, in 2014, Clinton stated that unaccompanied children crossing the border \"should be sent back.\" [499] She opposed and criticized Trump's call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States [500]\n\n\nForeign policy\nOn foreign affairs, Clinton voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq in October 2002, [501] a vote she later said she regretted [502] She favored arming Syria's rebel fighters in 2012 and has called for the removal of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad [503] She supported the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 and the NATO-led military intervention in Libya to oust former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 [504] [505] Clinton is in favor of maintaining American influence in the Middle East [500] She has told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, \"America can't ever be neutral when it comes to Israel's security and survival.\" [506] Clinton expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the 2006 Lebanon War and 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict [507] [508] In a 2017 interview, after a poison gas attack in Syria, Clinton said that she had favored more aggressive action against Bashar al-Assad: \"I think we should have been more willing to confront Assad I really believe we should have and still should take out his air fields and prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them.\" [509] Clinton opposed a ceasefire in the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, [510] stating \"Remember, there was a ceasefire on October 6, that Hamas broke by their barbaric assault on peaceful civilians.\" [511]\n\n\nReligious views\nClinton has been a lifelong Methodist, and has been part of United Methodist Church congregations throughout her life She has publicly discussed her Christian faith on several occasions, although seldom while campaigning [512] [513] Professor Paul Kengor, author of God and Hillary Clinton: A Spiritual Life, has suggested that Clinton's political positions are rooted in her faith She often expresses a maxim often attributed to John Wesley: \"Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can.\" [512]\n\n\nCultural and political image\nOver a hundred books and scholarly works have been written about Clinton A 2006 survey by the New York Observer found \"a virtual cottage industry\" of \"anti-Clinton literature\" put out by Regnery Publishing and other conservative imprints Some titles include Madame Hillary: The Dark Road to the White House, Hillary's Scheme: Inside the Next Clinton's Ruthless Agenda to Take the White House and Can She Be Stopped?: Hillary Clinton Will Be the Next President of the United States Unless .. Books praising Clinton did not sell nearly as well [514] (other than her memoirs and those of her husband) When she ran for Senate in 2000, several fundraising groups such as Save Our Senate and the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton sprang up to oppose her [515] Don Van Natta found that Republican and conservative groups viewed her as a reliable \"bogeyman\" to mention in fundraising letters, on a par with Ted Kennedy, and the equivalent of Democratic and liberal appeals mentioning Newt Gingrich [516]\n\n\nBooks\n\n\nAncestry\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\nOfficial\n\n\nMedia coverage\n\n\nOther\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

No I want you to walk away thinking, 'That's a family.' You don't think about what they represent.\"\n\n\nFilming\nBy the film's official announcement in July 2019, principal photography had begun at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England [55] [56] Ben Davis served as director of photography, after doing so on several previous MCU films [10] [57] Zhao said Marvel Studios allowed her creative freedom to shoot the film on location, \"exactly the way  [she] wanted to shoot\" it She was able to use a similar style to her previous films, including 360° shots and working with the same camera and rigs as were used for her film Nomadland (2020), [36] which Zhao was set to complete back-to-back with The Eternals [37] Zhao felt that she \"got lucky in that Marvel wants to take risks and do something different.\" [36] Zhao cited The Revenant (2015) as a primary influence when composing the film's action sequences [58]\n\n\nPost-production\nIn March 2020, Scanline VFX, one of the companies working on the film's visual effects, confirmed that they would be working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic [72] Industrial Light & Magic, Luma Pictures, RISE, and Weta Digital also worked on the film's visual effects [73] In early April, Disney shifted much of their Phase Four slate of films due to the pandemic, moving The Eternals' release date to February 12, 2021 [74] In August, the film's title was officially shortened from The Eternals to Eternals, [75] and the next month, the release date was pushed back to November 5, 2021 [76] Reshoots had taken place by mid-November 2020 [77]\n\n\nMusic\nRamin Djawadi composed the score for the film, after previously doing so for Marvel's Iron Man (2008) [86] Two songs from the film's soundtrack, \"Across the Oceans of Time\" and \"Eternals Theme\", were released as singles on October 22, 2021, while the full album was released on November 3 [87] [88]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe first footage of the film was released in May 2021 as part of a promotional video from Marvel Studios celebrating their films and a return to movie theaters [89] [90] Though the footage was limited and \"vague\", Hoai-Tran Bui at /Film still felt it was \"very exciting\" [91] Chaim Gartenberg of The Verge felt one of the biggest moments of the footage was seeing Jolie wielding a sword made of light He was also encouraged that Eternals appeared to be one of Marvel's first films to \"deliver on  [their] years-long promise of creating films with more diverse casts\" [89] Nerdist's Michael Arbeiter said the footage was quick, but felt that it \"manages an air of wonderment\" [90]\n\n\nRelease\nEternals had its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on October 18, 2021, [105] and was screened at the Rome Film Festival on October 24 [106] The film was released theatrically in many European countries on November 3, and in the United States and the United Kingdom on November 5 in RealD 3D and 4DX [106] In September 2021, Disney announced that the film would have an exclusive theatrical release for a minimum of 45 days [107] Eternals was previously set for release on November 6, 2020, [108] before it was shifted to February 12, 2021, [74] and

Variety noted \"added to rumors\" that the films would not be released in China, especially since Zhao had become \"an unexpected persona non grata\" in the country after she was scrutinized by Chinese netizens over her remarks in a 2013 interview with Filmmaker magazine in which she described China as \"a place where there are lies everywhere\" [110] [111] [112] By September 2021, Deadline

Marvel Comics race of the same name. It is directed by Chloé Zhao and produced by Kevin Feige. The film is the 26th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and the first to be released as part of the studio's Phase Four.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in 5000 BC, where ten superpowered beings known as Eternals—Ajak, Sersi, Ikaris, Kingo, Sprite, Phastos, Makkari, Druig, Gilgamesh, and Thena—are sent to Earth by Arishem, a Celestial, on the starship Domo. They are charged with exterminating invasive entities known as the Deviants. After the last Deviants are killed in 1521, the group's opinions differ over their continued relationship with humankind. Over the next 500 years, they mostly live apart, waiting for Arishem's orders.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features an ensemble cast, including:\n\n* Gemma Chan as Sersi\n* Richard Madden as Ikaris\n* Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo\n* Lia McHugh as Sprite\n* Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos\n* Lauren Ridloff as Makkari\n* Don Lee as Gilgamesh\n* Harish Patel as Karun Patel, Kingo's human valet\n* Haaz Sleiman and Esai Daniel Cross as Phastos's husband Ben and son Jack\n* Zain Al Rafeea as a villager who comes across the Eternals when they first arrive on Earth\n* Harry Styles as Eros / Starfox, the brother of MCU character Thanos\n* Patton Oswalt as Eros's assistant Pip the Troll\n* Mahershala Ali has an uncredited voice-only cameo as Blade in the post-credits scene\n\n**Production**\n\nIn April 2015, Marvel Television was working with screenwriter John Ridley to craft a new television series for ABC, \"reinventing\" an existing Marvel character or property, which was revealed years later to be the Eternals. Through its development, which ultimately had eventually been abandoned during the folding of Marvel Television in December 2019, Ridley stated that he was trying to make a superhero television series that viewers had not necessarily seen before, with hopes that it could occupy \"a space that [was] not currently being filled\" by Marvel.\n\nIn July 2019, the film was officially announced, with Chloé Zhao set to direct. The film's cast was announced in August 2019, with the exception of Harry Styles, who was added to the cast in October 2019. Filming took place at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England, with principal photography beginning in July 2019.\n\n**Filming**\n\nBen Davis served as director of photography, after doing so on several previous MCU films. Zhao said Marvel Studios allowed her creative freedom to shoot the film on location, \"exactly the way [she] wanted to shoot\" it. She was able to use a similar style to her previous films, including 360° shots and working with the same camera and rigs as were used for her film Nomadland (2020).\n\n**Post-production**\n\nIn March 2020, Scanline VFX, one of the companies working on the film's visual effects, confirmed that they would be working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Industrial Light & Magic, Luma Pictures, RISE, and Weta Digital also worked on the film's visual effects. In early April, Disney shifted much of their Phase Four slate of films due to the pandemic, moving The Eternals' release date to February 12, 2021. In August, the film's title was officially shortened from The Eternals to Eternals. Reshoots had taken place by mid-November 2020.\n\n**Music**\n\nRamin Djawadi composed the score for the film, after previously doing so for Marvel's Iron Man (2008). Two songs from the film's soundtrack, \"Across the Oceans of Time\" and \"Eternals Theme\", were released as singles on October 22, 2021, while the full album was released on November 3.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe first footage of the film was released in May 2021 as part of a promotional video from Marvel Studios celebrating their films and a return to movie theaters. Chaim Gartenberg of The Verge felt one of the biggest moments of the footage was seeing Gemma Chan wielding a sword made of light. He was also encouraged that Eternals appeared to be one of Marvel's first films to \"deliver on [their] years-long promise of creating films with more diverse casts\".\n\n**Release**\n\nEternals had its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on October 18, 2021.

incomplete due to security reasons, as the words \"Meiji Tsuho\" and the mark of the Minister of Finance were added by the Imperial Printing Bureau Woodblock printing was eventually employed to save hundreds of people the work of handwriting the characters \"Meiji Tsuho\" on each individual note One yen notes in particular were released in April 1872 (year 5), with subsidiary notes of 10, 20, and 50 sen [4] These notes measure 113mm x 71mm in size, and featured an elaborate design that was difficult to forge at the time as counterfeiting was previously rampant with clan notes [5] [6] Eventually enough Western technology was brought over to Japan as the Japanese government produced some one yen Meiji Tsūhō notes domestically [6]\n\n\nMeiji Tsuho (1872-1879)\nThe first one yen notes adopted and released by the Japanese government were part of a series known as Meiji Tsūhō (明治通宝) These notes were the first Japanese currency ever to be printed using western printing at Dondorf and Naumann, which was located in Frankfurt [1] Meiji Tsuho notes were designed by Edoardo Chiossone sometime in 1870 while he was working for Dondorf Naumann on behalf of The National Bank in the Kingdom of Italy [2] The process of making Chiossone's proposed design a reality started with the establishment of the \"Imperial Printing Bureau of Japan\" in 1871 (4th year of Meiji) In order to produce the currency the Japanese government reached out to Dondorf and Naumann to gain access to Western technology [2] Chiossone had a falling out with Italian Bank as his relationship with them had hit a breaking point When the company suggested Chiossone for the role as engraver, he quickly accepted the offer [2] The production of money was handed over to the Imperial Printing Bureau in January 1872

Tsūhō notes domestically [6]\n\n\nNational Bank Notes (1873-1880)\nThe idea for national bank notes (国立銀行紙幣) in Japan came from Itō Hirobumi when he was studying the United States in 1871 [13] During this time the Meiji government was working to establish a gold-backed monetary system based on Hirobumi's recommendation The Japanese government accepted Hirobumi's proposal for national bank notes in 1872 by establishing the \"National Bank Act\" which organized a decentralized \"U.S.-style\" system of national banks [13] Each of these banks was chartered by the state to issue notes exchangeable for gold from reserves held by the banks [13] [14] Permission was eventually given to these private banks allowing national bank notes to be issued in August 1873 [15] [16] The first bank notes issued are also referred to as old national bank notes (旧国立銀行券) [17] One yen national bank notes in particular measure 80 mm x 190 mm in size, and are modeled after their counterparts in the United States The obverse features samurai Nonoka Okumura (上毛野田道), a warship, and bank seals, while the reverse depicts a Mongol invasion [17] [18] These circulated as convertible notes for roughly three years before the rising price of gold became an issue An amendment to the National Bank Act was adopted in August 1876 making the notes inconvertible [14] [19] [20] Under this amendment there was no limit on the amount of paper money that could be issued [19] This action also allowed private banks to redeem national bank notes for government issued inconvertible Meiji Tsuho notes rather than for gold [20] Negative effects from this amendment in the form of inflation were greatly amplified by the Satsuma Rebellion in February 1877 While the rebellion was quickly resolved, the Japanese government had to print a large amount of fiat notes as payment [8] [21]\n\n\nModified \"Jingū\" Banknotes (1881-1886)\nPrevious Meiji Tsūhō one yen notes were printed using western technology which had its disadvantages in terms of quality Over time these fragile notes became discolored easily due to the climate of Japan [27] [28] Counterfeiting was another issue as these thieves eventually found a way around the elaborate Meiji Tsūhō design [7] The Japanese government took action by releasing a new series referred to as modified banknotes (改造紙幣) Notes for this particular denomination measure 77mm x 131mm in size, and are commonly referred to as Empress Jingu 1-yen notes (神功皇后1円札) because of their design [29] These notes feature an artist's representation of Empress Jingū that was commissioned by Italian engraver Edoardo Chiossone [27] This design is notable for being the first portrait on a Japanese banknote, and the only female depicted in the history of Japanese paper currency [30] Also present on the obverse are counterfeit penalties which were later expanded in the Meiji era [31] [32] The reverse side meanwhile features inscriptions from the Ministry of Finance, and displays the Treasurer's seal One yen modified banknotes were released in February 1881 (year 14 of Meiji), and were intended to be exchanged for old Meiji Tsuho notes [11] [33] During this time inflation hit an all time high due to the amount of non convertible paper currency in circulation (see section above) Measures were put into place which included the establishment of a centralized bank known as the Bank of Japan in 1882 All of the paper money in circulation was to be retired in favor of either silver coinage or newly printed Bank of Japan notes One yen modified banknotes notes were redeemed for silver starting in January 1886 as production decreased for the series [24] The Japanese government adopted the gold standard on March 26, 1897 which switched over the redemption of government banknotes from silver to gold [34] This was followed by a deadline set in June 1898 to prohibit circulation of government notes by the end of the century [24] Modified one yen \"Jingū\" banknotes were abolished by the set deadline on December 31, 1899 [24] [34]\n\n\nBank of Japan Notes\nDuring the early 1880s, then prime minister Matsukata Masayoshi was dealing with a serious inflation problem caused by an abundance of circulating devalued currency On June 27, 1882 Masayoshi suspended the issuance of inconvertible National Bank, and government issued notes to remedy the situation He then established a new centralized banking system through the \"Bank of Japan Regulation\" which gave 10 million yen for a new central bank [14] [23] The Bank of Japan hence commenced operations on October 10, 1882 with the authority to print banknotes that could be exchanged for the old Government and National Bank Notes [24] [21] The first step towards this process was an amendment made to the regulation in May 1883 which provided the redemption and retirement of national bank notes [25] [35] New banknotes could not be issued during this time as there was an imbalance between existing coins and notes in regards to silver [36] [37] It took another year before the redemption of old paper currency stabilized the price of silver alloy [37]\n\n\nDaikokuten Notes (1885-1958)\nDuring the early 1880s, then prime minister Matsukata Masayoshi was dealing with a serious inflation problem caused by an abundance of circulating devalued currency On June 27, 1882 Masayoshi suspended the issuance of inconvertible National Bank, and government issued notes to remedy the situation He then established a new centralized banking system through the \"Bank of Japan Regulation\" which gave 10 million yen for a new central bank [14] [23] The Bank of Japan hence commenced operations on October 10, 1882 with the authority to print banknotes that could be exchanged for the old Government and National Bank Notes [24] [21] The first step towards this process was an amendment made to the regulation in May 1883 which provided the redemption and retirement of national bank notes [25] [35] New banknotes could not be issued during this time as there was an imbalance between existing coins and notes in regards to silver [36] [37] It took another year before the redemption of old paper currency stabilized the price of silver alloy [37]\n\n\nModified Convertible Banknotes (1889-1958)\nOn May 1, 1889 (22nd year of Meiji) the Bank of Japan printed new one yen silver certificates to replace the old \"Daikokuten\" notes [39] This action had to be undertaken to address design flaws which caused the latter series to be eaten and discolored Modified one yen notes are now officially referred to as former convertible banknotes (旧兌換銀行券) in relation to events that occurred since their release This series is broken up into two different varieties called Kanji one yen (漢数字1円) and Arabic one yen (アラビア数字一円) aka Taishō one yen banknotes (大正兌換銀行券1円) [44] Kanji one yen notes were the first variety to be released as the serial numbers are written in kanji Notes from this series all measure 85mm X 145mm in size, and feature legendary Japanese hero-statesman Takenouchi no Sukune on the obverse [45] With this legendary figure are inscriptions in three circles that reference the convertible wording, the Dajo-kwan Notification of 1884 (year 17 of Meiji), and counterfeit penalties [45] The reverse side of the notes meanwhile feature a contemporary one yen silver coin with the convertible wording written in English [45] Security features include paulownia watermarks, and the words \"Silver Standard One Yen Bill\" when held up to a light source Originally these notes were intended to be silver certificates that could be converted through a bank transaction into a one yen silver coin Problems arose when foreign countries left the silver standard leading to a large increase in worldwide silver production As the price of silver dropped the value of the silver yen went along with it causing inflation [46] The Japanese government was now eager to drop the silver standard in favor of something more sustainable.\n\n\nFirst issue series (1943-1958)\nThe \"Bank of Japan Act\" was promulgated on February 24, 1942 allowing the Bank of Japan to be re-organized to reflect the reality of World War II [51] This act empowered the Bank of Japan to release nonconvertible notes in denominations of 1, 5, 10, and eventually 100 yen as fiat currency [52] [53] These notes are part of the First issue series (い号券), which is a collective term for notes issued after the Bank of Japan was re-organized One yen notes from this series measure 81 mm x 142 mm in size, and are also called Chuo Takenouchi one yen (中央武内1円) after their design [54] This design features Japanese hero-statesman Takenouchi no Sukune on the obverse, and Ube shrine on the reverse Chuo Takenouchi one yen notes were released into circulation on December 15, 1943 (18th year of Shōwa) [55] These notes were manufactured in poor condition due to budget cuts made in preparation for the war [53] Changes to production included a shift from mitsumata paper material to pulp as mitsumata required more time and labor to manufacture [56] Other changes involved the simplification of printing, raw materials, and design patterns as personnel and materials were in short supply [53] Security features were added in the form of  paulownia watermarks when held up to a light source Overall, the issuance of fiat currency was strongly criticized by the public as the Japanese government abandoned its promise to convert paper money to gold [53]\n\n\nA series (1946-1958)\nNotes from the \"A series\" (A号券) were the last denomination of \"one yen\" to be issued as paper currency in Japan When World War II ended the amount of banknotes issued compared to before the war had more than tripled This was due to factors such as wartime compensation, payment of retirement allowances to veterans, and refunds due to forced deposits and savings made during the war [61] All of these things had a negative effect on the Japanese economy due to rampant inflation and the devaluation of the yen In order to control the situation a process known as new yen switching (新円切替) was implemented by the Shidehara Cabinet [58] The \"A series\" acted as renewal currency when banknotes were issued in denominations of 1, 5, 10, and 100 yen throughout 1946 (21st year of Shōwa) [62] One yen notes are also referred to as \"Ninomiya 1-yen banknotes\" (買取価格が高い二宮1円) as the obverse features agricultural leader Ninomiya Sontoku The reverse side meanwhile uses a colored pattern ripple design with \"1 Yen\" written in English This design had to be approved by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (GHQ) before it was implemented for use [61] These notes were issued both by the Bank of Japan and the Japanese government in name only, as production and printing was outsourced to the private sector [63] [64]\n\n\nWatermarks\nThe value of any given banknote is determined by survivability rate and condition as collectors in general prefer original notes with bright rich coloring In contrast to this are notes with ink stains, missing pieces, and evidence of repairs which can all impact their value Exceptions to this include extremely rare banknotes where there are few surviving examples (ex: National Gold Bank Note) The oldest one yen notes include the Meiji Tsūhō series which were first issued in 1872 and later abolished in 1899 These were mostly made in Germany with a print run of 39,814,943 notes from in Frankfurt, and 5,394,916 notes made in Japan during their fifteen year use in commerce [6] This combined figure is the third highest print run after the smaller denomination Meiji Tsūhō 10 and 20 sen notes [7] Notes from the one yen denomination are thus easier to obtain as they were made in relatively large amounts Many of the surviving examples are in better conditions due to a portion being made domestically [7] These notes can be obtained in average condition for 6,000+ yen (~$60+ USD), with prices reaching 100,000 yen (~$1,000 USD) for examples in top conditions [66] Professional grading is recommended for this series as \"many\" counterfeit notes exist on the market [7] The next series are National Bank Notes issued from 1873 to 1880 in two different varieties Both of these \"old\" and \"new\" national one yen banknote varieties are now rare due to events surrounding the aftermath of the Satsuma Rebellion in 1877 In order to pay for this event a large amount of banknotes were printed and released into circulation as a way to ease the economic situation This wound up having a negative effect in the form of rampant inflation which caused National banknotes to be actively collected by officials [22] [67] These are now popular banknotes among collectors which are rarely seen on the marketplace [17] [68] When they are up for the sale, one yen national bank notes sell in the hundreds of thousands of yen ($1,000s USD) in average condition [68] [69] It is recommended that ungraded notes be checked for authenticity given their rarity [70] The final government series include one yen Modified \"Jingū\" Banknotes issued from 1881 to 1886 These are also popular as they are Japan's first portrait-filled banknote [11] \"Jingū\" one yen notes are scarcely valued in the tens to hundreds of thousands of yen ($100s-$1000s USD) depending on condition as they were not issued for a long period of time [11] [71]\n\n\nCollecting\nThe value of any given banknote is determined by survivability rate and condition as collectors in general prefer original

Bank Notes\nThe first one yen notes adopted and released by the Japanese government were part of a series known as Meiji Tsūhō (明治通宝) These notes were the first Japanese currency ever to be printed using western printing at Dondorf and Naumann, which was located in Frankfurt [1] Meiji Tsuho notes were designed by Edoardo Chiossone sometime in 1870 while he was working for Dondorf Naumann on behalf of The National Bank in the Kingdom of Italy [2] The process of making Chiossone's proposed design a reality started with the establishment of the \"Imperial Printing Bureau of Japan\" in 1871 (4th year of Meiji) In order to produce the currency the Japanese government reached out to Dondorf and Naumann to gain access to Western technology [2] Chiossone had a falling out with Italian Bank as his relationship with them had hit a breaking point When the company suggested Chiossone for the role as engraver, he quickly accepted the offer [2] The production of money was handed over to the Imperial Printing Bureau in January 1872 when banknotes began to arrive from Germany [3] All of these arrivals were purposely left incomplete due to security reasons, as the words \"Meiji Tsuho\" and the mark of the Minister of Finance were added by the Imperial Printing Bureau Woodblock printing was eventually employed to save hundreds of people the work of handwriting the characters \"Meiji Tsuho\" on each individual note One yen notes in particular were released in April 1872 (year 5), with subsidiary notes of 10, 20, and 50 sen [4] These notes measure 113mm x 71mm in size, and featured an elaborate design that was difficult to forge at the time as counterfeiting was previously rampant with clan notes [5] [6] Eventually enough Western technology was brought over to Japan as the Japanese government produced some one yen Meiji Tsūhō notes domestically [6]\n\n\nMeiji Tsuho (1872-1879)\nThe first one yen notes adopted and released by the Japanese government were part of a series known as Meiji Tsūhō (明治通宝) These notes were the first Japanese currency ever to be printed using western printing at Dondorf and Naumann, which was located in Frankfurt [1] Meiji Tsuho notes were

with clan notes [5] [6] Eventually enough Western technology was brought over to Japan as the Japanese government produced some one yen Meiji Tsūhō notes domestically [6]\n\n\nNational Bank Notes (1873-1880)\nThe idea for national bank notes (国立銀行紙幣) in Japan came from Itō Hirobumi when he was studying the United States in 1871 [13] During this time the Meiji government was working to establish a gold-backed monetary system based on Hirobumi's recommendation The Japanese government accepted Hirobumi's proposal for national bank notes in 1872 by establishing the \"National Bank Act\" which organized a decentralized \"U.S.-style\" system of national banks [13] Each of these banks was chartered by the state to issue notes exchangeable for gold from reserves held by the banks [13] [14] Permission was eventually given to these private banks allowing national bank notes to be issued in August 1873 [15] [16] The first bank notes issued are also referred to as old national bank notes (旧国立銀行券) [17] One yen national bank notes in particular measure 80 mm x 190 mm in size, and are modeled after their counterparts in the United States The obverse features samurai Nonoka Okumura (上毛野田道), a warship, and bank seals, while the reverse depicts a Mongol invasion [17] [18] These circulated as convertible notes for roughly three years before the rising price of gold became an issue An amendment to the National Bank Act was adopted in August 1876 making the notes inconvertible [14] [19] [20] Under this amendment there was no limit on the amount of paper money that could be issued [19] This action also allowed private banks to redeem national bank notes for government issued inconvertible Meiji Tsuho notes rather than for gold [20] Negative effects from this amendment in the form of inflation were greatly amplified by the Satsuma Rebellion in February 1877 While the rebellion was quickly resolved, the Japanese government had to print a large amount of fiat notes as payment [8] [21]\n\n\nModified \"Jingū\" Banknotes (1881-1886)\nPrevious Meiji Tsūhō one yen notes were printed using western technology which had its disadvantages in terms of quality Over time these fragile notes became discolored easily due to the climate of Japan [27] [28] Counterfeiting was another issue as these thieves eventually found a way around the elaborate Meiji Tsūhō design [7] The Japanese government took action by releasing a new series referred to as modified banknotes (改造紙幣) Notes for this particular denomination measure 77mm x 131mm in size, and are commonly referred to as Empress Jingu 1-yen notes (神功皇后1円札) because of their design [29] These notes feature an artist's representation of Empress Jingū that was commissioned by Italian engraver Edoardo Chiossone [27] This design is notable for being the first portrait on a Japanese banknote, and the only female depicted in the history of Japanese paper currency [30] Also present on the obverse are counterfeit penalties which were later expanded in the Meiji era [31] [32] The reverse side meanwhile features inscriptions from the Ministry of Finance, and displays the Treasurer's seal One yen modified banknotes were released in February 1881 (year 14 of Meiji), and were intended to be exchanged for old Meiji Tsuho notes [11] [33] During this time inflation hit an all time high due to the amount of non convertible paper currency in circulation (see section above) Measures were put into place which included the establishment of a centralized bank known as the Bank of Japan in 1882 All of the paper money in circulation was to be retired in favor of either silver coinage or newly printed Bank of Japan notes One yen modified banknotes notes were redeemed for silver starting in January 1886 as production decreased for the series [24] The Japanese government adopted the gold standard on March 26, 1897 which switched over the redemption of government banknotes from silver to gold [34] This was followed by a deadline set in June 1898 to prohibit circulation of government notes by the end of the century [24] Modified one yen \"Jingū\" banknotes were abolished by the set deadline on December 31, 1899 [24] [34]\n\n\nBank of Japan Notes\nDuring the early 1880s, then prime minister Matsukata Masayoshi was dealing with a serious inflation problem caused by an abundance of circulating devalued currency On June 27, 1882 Masayoshi suspended the issuance of inconvertible National Bank, and government issued notes to remedy the situation He then established a new centralized banking system through the \"Bank of Japan Regulation\" which gave 10 million yen for a new central bank [14] [23] The Bank of Japan hence commenced operations on October 10, 1882 with the authority to print banknotes that could be exchanged for the old Government and National Bank Notes [24] [21] The first step towards this process was an amendment made to the regulation in May 1883 which provided the redemption and retirement of national bank notes [25] [35] New banknotes could not be issued during this time as there was an imbalance between existing coins and notes in regards to silver [36] [37] It took another year before the redemption of old paper currency stabilized the price of silver alloy [37]\n\n\nDaikokuten Notes (1885-1958)\nDuring the early 1880s, then prime minister Matsukata Masayoshi was dealing with a serious inflation problem caused by an abundance of circulating devalued currency On June 27, 1882 Masayoshi suspended the issuance of inconvertible National Bank, and government issued notes to remedy the situation He then established a new centralized banking system through the \"Bank of Japan Regulation\" which gave 10 million yen for a new central bank [14] [23] The Bank of Japan hence commenced operations on October 10, 1882 with the authority to print banknotes that could be exchanged for the old Government and National Bank Notes [24] [21] The first step towards this process was an amendment made to the regulation in May 1883 which provided the redemption and retirement of national bank notes [25] [35] New banknotes could not be issued during this time as there was an imbalance between existing coins and notes in regards to silver [36] [37] It took another year before the redemption of old paper currency stabilized the price of silver alloy [37]\n\n\nModified Convertible Banknotes (1889-1958)\nOn May 1, 1889 (22nd year of Meiji) the Bank of Japan printed new one yen silver certificates to replace the old \"Daikokuten\" notes [39] This action had to be undertaken to address design flaws which caused the latter series to be eaten and discolored Modified one yen notes are now officially referred to as former convertible banknotes (旧兌換銀行券) in relation to events that occurred since their release This series is broken up into two different varieties called Kanji one yen (漢数字1円) and Arabic one yen (アラビア数字一円) aka Taishō one yen banknotes (大正兌換銀行券1円) [44] Kanji one yen notes were the first variety to be released as the serial numbers are written in kanji Notes from this series all measure 85mm X 145mm in size, and feature legendary Japanese hero-statesman Takenouchi no Sukune on the obverse [45] With this legendary figure are inscriptions in three circles that reference the convertible wording, the Dajo-kwan Notification of 1884 (year 17 of Meiji), and counterfeit penalties [45] The reverse side of the notes meanwhile feature a contemporary one yen silver coin with the convertible wording written in English [45] Security features include paulownia watermarks, and the words \"Silver Standard One Yen Bill\" when held up to a light source Originally these notes were intended to be silver certificates that could be converted through a bank transaction into a one yen silver coin Problems arose when foreign countries left the silver standard leading to a large increase in worldwide silver production As the price of silver dropped the value of the silver yen went along with it causing inflation [46] The Japanese government was now eager to drop the silver standard in favor of something more sustainable.\n\n\nFirst issue series (1943-1958)\nThe \"Bank of Japan Act\" was promulgated on February 24, 1942 allowing the Bank of Japan to be re-organized to reflect the reality of World War II [51] This act empowered the Bank of Japan to release nonconvertible notes in denominations of 1, 5, 10, and eventually 100 yen as fiat currency [52] [53] These notes are part of the First issue series (い号券), which is a collective term for notes issued after the Bank of Japan was re-organized One yen notes from this series measure 81 mm x 142 mm in size, and are also called Chuo Takenouchi one yen (中央武内1円) after their design [54] This design features Japanese hero-statesman Takenouchi no Sukune on the obverse, and Ube shrine on the reverse Chuo Takenouchi one yen notes were released into circulation on December 15, 1943 (18th year of Shōwa) [55] These notes were manufactured in poor condition due to budget cuts made in preparation for the war [53] Changes to production included a shift from mitsumata paper material to pulp as mitsumata required more time and labor to manufacture [56] Other changes involved the simplification of printing, raw materials, and design patterns as personnel and materials were in short supply [53] Security features were added in the form of  paulownia watermarks when held up to a light source Overall, the issuance of fiat currency was strongly criticized by the public as the Japanese government abandoned its promise to convert paper money to gold [53]\n\n\nA series (1946-1958)\nNotes from the \"A series\" (A号券) were the last denomination of \"one yen\" to be issued as paper currency in Japan When World War II ended the amount of banknotes issued compared to before the war had more than tripled This was due to factors such as wartime compensation, payment of retirement allowances to veterans, and refunds due to forced deposits and savings made during the war [61] All of these things had a negative effect on the Japanese economy due to rampant inflation and the devaluation of the yen In order to control the situation a process known as new yen switching (新円切替) was implemented by the Shidehara Cabinet [58] The \"A series\" acted as renewal currency when banknotes were issued in denominations of 1, 5, 10, and 100 yen throughout 1946 (21st year of Shōwa) [62] One yen notes are also referred to as \"Ninomiya 1-yen banknotes\" (買取価格が高い二宮1円) as the obverse features agricultural leader Ninomiya Sontoku The reverse side meanwhile uses a colored pattern ripple design with \"1 Yen\" written in English This design had to be approved by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (GHQ) before it was implemented for use [61] These notes were issued both by the Bank of Japan and the Japanese government in name only, as production and printing was outsourced to the private sector [63] [64]\n\n\nWatermarks\nThe value of any given banknote is determined by survivability rate and condition as collectors in general prefer original notes with bright rich coloring In contrast to this are notes with ink stains, missing pieces, and evidence of repairs which can all impact their value Exceptions to this include extremely rare banknotes where there are few surviving examples (ex: National Gold Bank Note) The oldest one yen notes include the Meiji Tsūhō series which were first issued in 1872 and later abolished in 1899 These were mostly made in Germany with a print run of 39,814,943 notes from in Frankfurt, and 5,394,916 notes made in Japan during their fifteen year use in commerce [6] This combined figure is the third highest print run after the smaller denomination Meiji Tsūhō 10 and 20 sen notes [7] Notes from the one yen denomination are thus easier to obtain as they were made in relatively large amounts Many of the surviving examples are in better conditions due to a portion being made domestically [7] These notes can be obtained in average condition for 6,000+ yen (~$60+ USD), with prices reaching 100,000 yen (~$1,000 USD) for examples in top conditions [66] Professional grading is recommended for this series as \"many\" counterfeit notes exist on the market [7] The next series are National Bank Notes issued from 1873 to 1880 in two different varieties Both of these \"old\" and \"new\" national one yen banknote varieties are now rare due to events surrounding the aftermath of the Satsuma Rebellion in 1877 In order to pay for this event a large amount of banknotes were printed and released into circulation as a way to ease the economic situation This wound up having a negative effect in the form of rampant inflation which caused National banknotes to be actively collected by officials [22] [67] These are now popular banknotes among collectors which are rarely seen on the marketplace [17] [68] When they are up for the sale, one yen national bank notes sell in the hundreds of thousands of yen ($1,000s USD) in average condition [68] [69] It is recommended that ungraded notes be checked for authenticity given their rarity [70] The final government series include one yen Modified \"Jingū\" Banknotes issued from 1881 to 1886 These are also popular as they are Japan's first portrait-filled banknote [11] \"Jingū\" one yen notes are scarcely valued in the tens to hundreds of thousands of yen ($100s-$1000s USD) depending on condition as

Dogg, after performing for a concert in Uppsala, Sweden, on July 25, 2015, was pulled over and detained by Swedish police for allegedly using illegal drugs, violating a Swedish law enacted in 1988 which criminalized the recreational use of such substances – therefore making even being under the influence of any illegal/controlled substance a crime itself without possession During the detention he was taken to the police station to perform a drug test and was released shortly afterwards The rapid test was positive for traces of narcotics and he was potentially subject to fines depending on the results of more detailed analysis [283] [284] Although final results \"strongly\" indicated drug use the charges were ultimately dropped because it could not be proven that he was in Sweden when he consumed the substances [285] The rapper uploaded several videos on the social networking site Instagram criticizing the police for alleged racial profiling; police spokesman Daniel Nilsson responded to the accusations, saying: \"we don't work like that in Sweden\" He declared in the videos, \"Niggas got me in the back of police car right now in Sweden, cuz\", and \"Pulled a nigga over

{"title": "Kenosha_unrest_shooting", "content": "\nBackground\nOn August 23, 2020, civil unrest erupted in Kenosha after the shooting of Jacob Blake, an African-American man who was shot seven times by a Kenosha police officer and became paralyzed from the waist down [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] Following a resurgence in protests that were part of the Black Lives Matter movement after other high-profile killings of African-Americans by police officers in 2020, the protests in Kenosha included rallies, marches, property damage, arson, and clashes with police between August 23 and September 1 [33]\n\n\nPeople involved\nAt the time of the shooting, Kyle Rittenhouse was 17 years old Kyle's father was living in Kenosha, but Kyle lived with his mother in Antioch, Illinois, a community about 20 driving miles away [31] [44] [45] Prior to the Kenosha unrest, he had participated in local police cadet programs and expressed support on social media for the Blue Lives Matter movement and law enforcement [46] [44] [47] Three months prior to the shooting, [48] Rittenhouse's friend, Dominick Black, purchased a semi-automatic, [49] AR-15 style rifle [44] as a favor for him in Wisconsin since Rittenhouse was too young to purchase a gun [50] [51] Black's stepfather stored the gun in a locked safe at his home in Kenosha but had relocated the weapon to an unsecured area in the basement on August 24, the second day of the Kenosha unrest, for ready access in case of a break-in [52] [53] [54]\n\n\nSequence of events\nAfter the city suffered building and vehicle damage during protests on August 24, [56] social media had drawn locals and outsiders, left-wing activists and right-wing militia into the city streets despite an evening curfew imposed on citizens [35] Some 250 National Guard members were deployed to the city [56]\n\n\nBefore the shooting\nAfter the city suffered building and vehicle damage during protests on August 24, [56] social media had drawn locals and outsiders, left-wing activists and right-wing militia into the city streets despite an evening curfew imposed on citizens [35] Some 250 National Guard members were deployed to the city [56]\n\n\nRittenhouse\nOn August 24, Rittenhouse drove to Kenosha to stay with his friend Dominick Black [64] [52] The following day, August 25, Rittenhouse helped clean graffiti off a school [65] Later, Rittenhouse and Black, both armed with rifles, arrived at Car Source [66] [67] Accounts differ as to whether Rittenhouse and Black's help was requested by Car Source The dealership owner's sons denied that gunmen had been asked to defend the business, [68] [69] but several witnesses testified that armed individuals had been directly sought out by the business to protect their property [68]\n\n\nRosenbaum\nIn the hours leading up to the shooting, prosecution witnesses described Rosenbaum as \"hyperaggressive and acting out in a violent manner\" [6] and \"acting very belligerently\" [72]\n\n\nFirst confrontation\nAccording to his testimony, Rittenhouse was on patrol along Sheridan Road south of 60th Street with another armed volunteer, Ryan Balch While patrolling, Rittenhouse lost contact with Balch, and so turned back up Sheridan Road towards the Car Source location at 59th and Sheridan (referred to during the trial as \"Car Source 2\") where he had been originally posted However, he was stopped by police stationed at the junction of Sheridan Road and 60th Street, who turned him back, saying they were not allowing anybody to cross north of 60th Street Rittenhouse then went to the nearby Ultimate Gas Station, believing this to be a safe location [76]\n\n\nSecond confrontation\nGaige Grosskreutz testified that he was filming the protest as a legal observer for the American Civil Liberties Union on a Facebook livestream Shortly before midnight, Grosskreutz said he heard gunshots to the south and observed Rittenhouse running in his direction [91] on Sheridan Road [92] Grosskreutz said he ran alongside Rittenhouse and asked \"Hey, what are you doing? You shot somebody?\" [91]\n\n\nAfter the shooting\nRittenhouse got back to his feet and walked towards police with his hands up and the rifle strapped across his chest [60] Several police officers testified during the trial that they were responding to an active shooter incident and did not recognize that Rittenhouse was the shooter [104] He was repeatedly told to get out of the road, and when he continued to advance, one officer attempted to pepper-spray him [104] [105] [106] Several witnesses and protesters had shouted for Rittenhouse to be arrested [80] [107] When asked at a press conference why Rittenhouse was not stopped, Kenosha Sheriff David Beth said, \"In situations that are high-stress, you have such incredible tunnel vision\" and implied officers may not have realized he had been involved in the shooting [108] Likewise, Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis said that \"there was nothing to suggest this individual was involved in any criminal behavior\" due to the fact that someone walking towards the police with their hands up was \"no longer abnormal\" in the wake of the protests [109]\n\n\nDetention and release\nRittenhouse returned to his hometown of Antioch, Illinois and turned himself in to police about an hour after the shootings in Kenosha [115] [116] [117] and was held in a juvenile facility in Illinois [118] until he was extradited to Wisconsin on October 30, 2020 [119] [120] He was released from detention on November 20, after posting $2 million bail [121] [122]\n\n\nRittenhouse criminal trial\nRittenhouse's trial began on November 1, 2021, and concluded on November 19 in the Kenosha County Circuit Court [132] Rittenhouse was represented by attorneys Mark Richards, Corey Chirafisi, and Natalie Wisco; the State was represented by ADAs Thomas Binger and James Kraus The presiding judge was Bruce E Schroeder [133] Jury selection on November 1 resulted in a 20-person panel of 12 jurors and eight alternates [134] The jury heard testimony from over 30 witnesses [135] and viewed more than a dozen videos taken on the night of the shooting [136] During the trial, prosecutors argued that Rittenhouse was seen as an active shooter and had provoked the other participants while defense lawyers argued the affirmative defense of self-defense on the grounds that Rittenhouse had been chased and attacked [137]\n\n\nCharges\nUnder Wisconsin state law, Rittenhouse was charged as an adult with the following crimes: [e]\n\n\nPretrial rulings\nAt a hearing on September 17, 2021, Schroeder denied prosecutors' requests to admit Rittenhouse's meeting with Proud Boys members and a previous fight that he was involved in as evidence in the case, finding that the incidents were \"too dissimilar\" to the shooting [151] Schroeder also denied the defense's request to admit evidence of Rosenbaum's prior criminal record as a sex offender [152] [153] On October 25, Schroeder defined what testimony would or would not be admissible by both the defense and the prosecution [154] Schroeder ordered that the men shot by Rittenhouse could not be referred to as victims, but determined they could be described as arsonists or looters if the defense was able to establish evidence that Rosenbaum, Huber, or Grosskreutz were engaged in those activities that night [155] [156] Legal experts stated that saying the term \"victim\" can appear prejudicial in a court of law, which would heavily influence a jury by presupposing who is innocent and guilty [156]\n\n\nArguments and testimonies\nTrial arguments and testimonies took place between November 2 and 15, 2021, in Kenosha County Courthouse After opening arguments, jurors were shown multiple video recordings of the events Video footage recorded shortly before the shooting showed Rosenbaum shouting \"Shoot me, nigger\" at an armed man who pointed a gun at him [157] [158] Two witnesses testified having seen Rosenbaum yelling and behaving violently before approaching Rittenhouse and trying to take his rifle A former marine testified that Rosenbaum had taunted him and other armed men before the shootings but said he did not consider Rosenbaum a threat [159] A witness who had spoken with Rittenhouse after the shooting recalled a nervous, pale, and sweating Rittenhouse as repeatedly saying \"I just shot someone.\" [159] The prosecution questioned why Rittenhouse would feel threatened while holding a rifle, and described him as an armed threat [160]\n\n\nMedia dispute\nOn November 18, Schroeder banned MSNBC and affiliates from the courthouse for the remainder of the trial after Kenosha police observed that a car driven by an MSNBC producer had followed the jury bus and ran a red light [169] [170] The driver, detained on suspicion of photographing jurors, was issued traffic citations and released by police after they failed to find pictures of jurors [170] NBC News denied their affiliated driver had intended to photograph or contact jurors during deliberations [171]\n\n\nAcquittal\nAfter the prosecution rested its case, the judge dismissed a charge of curfew violation against Rittenhouse, citing a lack of evidence offered by the prosecution; [17] the charge of unlawful possession of a firearm was also dismissed, based on the defense argument that the Wisconsin law restricts minors from carrying rifles only if they are short-barreled The barrel of Rittenhouse's rifle was longer than 16 inches, the shortest barrel length allowed for minors under state law [18] [172]\n\n\nOther litigation\nBlack was charged with two felony counts of intentionally giving a dangerous weapon to a minor, resulting in death, for supplying Rittenhouse with the rifle used to kill Rosenbaum and Huber [178] [179] Bond was set at $2500 [180] Black pleaded not guilty to the charges [179] In January 2022, as part of a plea deal in which prosecutors agreed to drop the two felony charges, Black pleaded no contest to contributing to the delinquency of a minor [181]\n\n\nCriminal charges\nBlack was charged with two felony counts of intentionally giving a dangerous weapon to a minor, resulting in death, for supplying Rittenhouse with the rifle used to kill Rosenbaum and Huber [178] [179] Bond was set at $2500 [180] Black pleaded not guilty to the charges [179] In January 2022, as part of a plea deal in which prosecutors agreed to drop the two felony charges, Black pleaded no contest to contributing to the delinquency of a minor [181]\n\n\nCivil litigation\nA lawsuit was filed in September 2020 by plaintiffs including the partner of Anthony Huber, seeking damages from Rittenhouse, Facebook, the far-right group Boogaloo Bois, and the Kenosha Guard militia and its commander The suit alleged negligence on the part of Facebook in allowing the Kenosha Guard to call for militia members on its platform and alleged that the defendants had participated in a conspiracy to violate their civil rights The suit was withdrawn by the plaintiffs without comment and dismissed with prejudice in the last week of January 2021 [186]\n\n\nResponses\nPublic sentiment regarding the shootings was polarized Coverage was both critical and supportive of Rittenhouse's actions, and used terms such as \"vigilante\" and \"terrorist\", but also \"volunteer\" and \"maintaining peace\" to describe him [20]\n\n\nCriticism of the police\nMany commentators were critical of the fact that Rittenhouse was not immediately arrested despite witnesses shouting that he was the shooter [80] [40] [202] The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) called for the resignations of Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis and of Kenosha Sheriff David Beth The ACLU statement argued that Beth's deputies fraternized with \"white supremacist counter-protesters\" during the day of the shooting and did not arrest the shooter The statement attacked Miskinis for blaming those shot in the course of the shooting when he said that the violence was the result of the \"persons\" involved violating curfew [203] The Kenosha mayor stated that he would not ask the sheriff or police chief to resign [204]\n\n\nResponses by authorities\nNBC News obtained a Department of Homeland Security internal document and reported that it directed federal law enforcement officials to make specific statements regarding Rittenhouse, such as noting that he \"took his rifle to the scene of the rioting to help defend small business owners\" and that \" [Rittenhouse] is innocent until proven guilty and deserves a fair trial based on all the facts, not just the ones that support a certain narrative.\" [205]\n\n\nResponses by Internet companies\nSeveral internet companies including Facebook, Twitter and GoFundMe restricted content related to Rittenhouse and the shooting [206] Two days after the shooting, [206] Facebook removed content supporting Rittenhouse, citing rules banning praise or support of mass shooters or glorification of violence [207] Facebook further disabled searches for \"Kyle Rittenhouse\", with a spokesperson saying \"We've designated this shooting as a mass murder and have removed the shooter's accounts from Facebook and Instagram\" [208] Shortly after the trial ended, Facebook lifted their ban [209] An online merchandise store run by Rittenhouse's family to fundraise for legal expenses was deplatformed twice, once by an unnamed vendor and again by Printify, the latter of whom stated \"we don't want to be affiliated with a story that's involved in such a complex, controversial and ongoing case.\" [210] GoFundMe, who banned the Rittenhouse defense fund because he was accused of a violent crime, lifted their ban after Rittenhouse was acquitted [211]\n\n\nPoliticians\nIn public

occurred on August 25, 2020, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, during civil unrest that followed the police shooting of Jacob Blake, an African-American man. The shooting involved 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse, who was charged with multiple crimes, including homicide, after he allegedly shot and killed two people and injured another.\n\n**Background**\n\nOn August 23, 2020, civil unrest erupted in Kenosha after the shooting of Jacob Blake, an African-American man who was shot seven times by a Kenosha police officer and became paralyzed from the waist down. Following a resurgence in protests that were part of the Black Lives Matter movement after other high-profile killings of African-Americans by police officers in 2020, the protests in Kenosha included rallies, marches, property damage, arson, and clashes with police between August 23 and September 1.\n\n**People Involved**\n\nAt the time of the shooting, Kyle Rittenhouse was 17 years old. His father was living in Kenosha, but Kyle lived with his mother in Antioch, Illinois, a community about 20 driving miles away. Prior to the Kenosha unrest, he had participated in local police cadet programs and expressed support on social media for the Blue Lives Matter movement and law enforcement. Three months prior to the shooting, Rittenhouse's friend, Dominick Black, purchased a semi-automatic AR-15 style rifle for him in Wisconsin since Rittenhouse was too young to purchase a gun.\n\n**Sequence of Events**\n\nAfter the city suffered building and vehicle damage during protests on August 24, social media had drawn locals and outsiders, left-wing activists and right-wing militia into the city streets despite an evening curfew imposed on citizens. Some 250 National Guard members were deployed to the city.\n\n**Rittenhouse**\n\nOn August 24, Rittenhouse drove to Kenosha to stay with his friend Dominick Black. The following day, August 25, Rittenhouse helped clean graffiti off a school. Later, Rittenhouse and Black, both armed with rifles, arrived at Car Source. Accounts differ as to whether Rittenhouse and Black's help was requested by Car Source. The dealership owner's sons denied that gunmen had been asked to defend the business, but several witnesses testified that armed individuals had been directly sought out by the business to protect their property.\n\n**Rosenbaum**\n\nIn the hours leading up to the shooting, prosecution witnesses described Rosenbaum as \"hyperaggressive and acting out in a violent manner\" and \"acting very belligerently.\" Rosenbaum was shot and killed by Rittenhouse during the confrontation.\n\n**First Confrontation**\n\nAccording to his testimony, Rittenhouse was on patrol along Sheridan Road south of 60th Street with another armed volunteer, Ryan Balch. While patrolling, Rittenhouse lost contact with Balch, and so turned back up Sheridan Road towards the Car Source location at 59th and Sheridan (referred to during the trial as \"Car Source 2\") where he had been originally posted. However, he was stopped by police stationed at the junction of Sheridan Road and 60th Street, who turned him back, saying they were not allowing anybody to cross north of 60th Street. Rittenhouse then went to the nearby Ultimate Gas Station, believing this to be a safe location.\n\n**Second Confrontation**\n\nGaige Grosskreutz testified that he was filming the protest as a legal observer for the American Civil Liberties Union on a Facebook livestream. Shortly before midnight, Grosskreutz said he heard gunshots to the south and observed Rittenhouse running in his direction on Sheridan Road. Grosskreutz said he ran alongside Rittenhouse and asked \"Hey, what are you doing? You shot somebody?\"\n\n**After the Shooting**\n\nRittenhouse got back to his feet and walked towards police with his hands up and the rifle strapped across his chest. Several police officers testified during the trial that they were responding to an active shooter incident and did not recognize that Rittenhouse was the shooter. He was repeatedly told to get out of the road, and when he continued to advance, one officer attempted to pepper-spray him. Several witnesses and protesters had shouted for Rittenhouse to be arrested. When asked at a press conference why Rittenhouse was not stopped, Kenosha Sheriff David Beth said, \"In situations that are high-stress, you have such incredible tunnel vision\" and implied officers may not have realized he had been involved in the shooting. Likewise, Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis said that \"there was nothing to suggest this individual was involved in any criminal behavior\" due to the fact that someone walking towards the police with their hands up was \"no longer abnormal\" in the wake of the protests.\n\n**Detention and Release**\n\nRittenhouse returned to his hometown of Antioch, Illinois and turned himself in to police about an hour after the shootings in Kenosha. He was held in a juvenile facility in Illinois until he was extradited to Wisconsin on October 30, 2020. He was released from detention on November 20, after posting $2 million bail.\n\n**Rittenhouse Criminal Trial**\n\nRittenhouse's trial began on November 1, 2021, and concluded on November 19 in the Kenosha County Circuit Court. Rittenhouse was represented by attorneys Mark Richards, Corey Chirafisi, and Natalie Wisco; the State was represented by ADAs Thomas Binger and James Kraus. Jury selection on November 1 resulted in a 20-person panel of 12 jurors and eight alternates. The jury heard testimony from over 30 witnesses and viewed more than a dozen videos taken on the night of the shooting. During the trial, prosecutors argued that Rittenhouse was seen as an active shooter and had provoked the other participants while defense lawyers argued the affirmative defense of self-defense on the grounds that Rittenhouse had been chased and attacked.\n\n**Charges**\n\nUnder Wisconsin state law, Rittenhouse was charged as an adult with the following crimes: first-degree reckless homicide, first-degree intentional homicide, and attempted first-degree intentional homicide.\n\n**Pretrial Rulings**\n\nAt a hearing on September 17, 2021, Judge Bruce E Schroeder denied prosecutors' requests to admit Rittenhouse's meeting with Proud Boys members and a previous fight that he was involved in as evidence in the case, finding that the incidents were \"too dissimilar\" to the shooting. Schroeder also denied the defense's request to admit evidence of Rosenbaum's prior criminal record as a sex offender.\n\n**Arguments and Testimonies**\n\nTrial arguments and testimonies took place between November 2 and 15, 2021, in Kenosha County Courthouse.

Wisconsin on October 30, 2020 [119] [120] He was released from detention on November 20, after posting $2 million bail [121] [122]\n\n\nRittenhouse criminal trial\nRittenhouse's trial began on November 1, 2021, and concluded on November 19 in the Kenosha County Circuit Court [132] Rittenhouse was represented by attorneys Mark Richards, Corey Chirafisi, and Natalie Wisco; the State was represented by ADAs Thomas Binger and James Kraus The presiding judge was Bruce E Schroeder [133] Jury selection on November 1 resulted in a 20-person panel of 12 jurors and eight alternates [134] The

active shooter and had provoked the other participants while defense lawyers argued the affirmative defense of self-defense on the grounds that Rittenhouse had been chased and attacked [137]\n\n\nCharges\nUnder Wisconsin state law, Rittenhouse was charged as an adult with the following crimes: [e]\n\n\nPretrial rulings\nAt a hearing on September 17, 2021, Schroeder denied prosecutors' requests to admit Rittenhouse's meeting with Proud Boys members and a previous fight that he was involved in as evidence in the case, finding that the incidents were \"too dissimilar\" to the shooting [151] Schroeder also denied the defense's request to admit evidence of Rosenbaum's prior criminal record as a sex offender [152] [153] On October 25, Schroeder defined what testimony would or would not be admissible by both the defense and the prosecution [154] Schroeder ordered that the men shot by Rittenhouse could not be referred to as victims, but determined they could be described as arsonists or looters if the defense was able to establish evidence that Rosenbaum, Huber, or Grosskreutz were engaged in those activities that night [155] [156] Legal experts stated that saying the term \"victim\" can appear prejudicial in a court of law, which would heavily influence a jury by presupposing who is innocent and guilty [156]\n\n\nArguments and testimonies\nTrial arguments and testimonies took place between November 2 and 15, 2021, in Kenosha County Courthouse After opening arguments, jurors were shown multiple video recordings of the events Video footage recorded shortly before the shooting showed Rosenbaum shouting \"Shoot me, nigger\" at an armed man who pointed a gun at him [157] [158] Two witnesses testified having seen Rosenbaum yelling and behaving violently before approaching Rittenhouse and trying to take his rifle A former marine testified that Rosenbaum had taunted him and other armed men before the shootings but said he did not consider Rosenbaum a threat [159] A witness who had spoken with Rittenhouse after the shooting recalled a nervous, pale, and sweating Rittenhouse as repeatedly saying \"I just shot someone.\" [159] The prosecution questioned why Rittenhouse would feel threatened while holding a rifle, and described him as an armed threat [160]\n\n\nMedia dispute\nOn November 18, Schroeder banned MSNBC and affiliates from the courthouse for the remainder of the trial after Kenosha police observed that a car driven by an MSNBC producer had followed the jury bus and ran a red light [169] [170] The driver, detained on suspicion of photographing jurors, was issued traffic citations and released by police after they failed to find pictures of jurors [170] NBC News denied their affiliated driver had intended to photograph or contact jurors during deliberations [171]\n\n\nAcquittal\nAfter the prosecution rested its case, the judge dismissed a charge of curfew violation against Rittenhouse, citing a lack of evidence offered by the prosecution; [17] the charge of unlawful possession of a firearm was also dismissed, based on the defense argument that the Wisconsin law restricts minors from carrying rifles only if they are short-barreled The barrel of Rittenhouse's rifle was longer than 16 inches, the shortest barrel length allowed for minors under state law [18] [172]\n\n\nOther litigation\nBlack was charged with two felony counts of intentionally giving a dangerous weapon to a minor, resulting in death, for supplying Rittenhouse with the rifle used to kill Rosenbaum and Huber [178] [179] Bond was set at $2500 [180] Black pleaded not guilty to the charges [179] In January 2022, as part of a plea deal in which prosecutors agreed to drop the two felony charges, Black pleaded no contest to contributing to the delinquency of a minor [181]\n\n\nCriminal charges\nBlack was charged with two felony counts of intentionally giving a dangerous weapon to a minor, resulting

plea deal in which prosecutors agreed to drop the two felony charges, Black pleaded no contest to contributing to the delinquency of a minor [181]\n\n\nCivil litigation\nA lawsuit was filed in September 2020 by plaintiffs including the partner of Anthony Huber, seeking damages from Rittenhouse, Facebook, the far-right group Boogaloo Bois, and the Kenosha Guard militia and its commander The suit alleged negligence on the part of Facebook in allowing the Kenosha Guard to call for militia members on its platform and alleged that the defendants had participated in a conspiracy to violate their civil rights The suit was withdrawn by the plaintiffs without comment and dismissed with prejudice in the last week of January 2021 [186]\n\n\nResponses\nPublic sentiment regarding the shootings was polarized Coverage was both critical and supportive of Rittenhouse's actions, and used terms such as \"vigilante\" and \"terrorist\", but also \"volunteer\" and \"maintaining peace\" to describe him [20]\n\n\nCriticism of the police\nMany commentators were critical of the fact that Rittenhouse was not immediately arrested despite witnesses shouting that he was the shooter [80] [40] [202] The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) called for the resignations of Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis and of Kenosha Sheriff David Beth The ACLU statement argued that Beth's deputies fraternized with \"white supremacist counter-protesters\" during the day of the shooting and did not arrest the shooter The statement attacked Miskinis for blaming those shot in the course of the shooting when he said that the violence was the result of the \"persons\" involved violating curfew [203] The Kenosha mayor stated that he would not ask the sheriff or police chief to resign [204]\n\n\nResponses by authorities\nNBC News obtained a Department of Homeland Security internal document and reported that it directed federal law enforcement officials to make specific statements regarding Rittenhouse, such as noting that he \"took his rifle to the scene of the rioting to help defend small business owners\" and that \" [Rittenhouse] is innocent until proven guilty and deserves a fair trial based on all the facts, not just the ones that support a certain narrative.\" [205]\n\n\nResponses by Internet companies\nSeveral internet companies including Facebook, Twitter and GoFundMe restricted content related to Rittenhouse and the shooting [206] Two days after the shooting, [206] Facebook removed content supporting Rittenhouse, citing rules banning praise or support of mass shooters or glorification of violence [207] Facebook further disabled searches for \"Kyle Rittenhouse\", with a spokesperson saying \"We've designated this shooting as a mass murder and have removed the shooter's accounts from Facebook and Instagram\" [208] Shortly after the trial ended, Facebook lifted their ban [209] An online merchandise store run by Rittenhouse's family to fundraise for legal expenses was deplatformed twice, once by an unnamed vendor and again by Printify, the latter of whom stated \"we don't want to be affiliated with a story that's involved in such a complex, controversial and ongoing case.\" [210] GoFundMe, who banned the Rittenhouse defense fund because he was accused of a violent crime, lifted their ban after Rittenhouse was acquitted [211]\n\n\nPoliticians\nIn public comments six days after the shooting, [212] then-President Donald Trump said it appeared that Rittenhouse was acting in self-defense, saying \"He was trying to get away from them, I guess, it looks like,\" noting the incident was under investigation and \"I guess he was in very big trouble He probably would have been killed.\" [113] [213] The former president later described the trial as a

The virus, which was spread through contact with infected individuals, caused a rapid decline in the human population, leaving behind a small number of survivors who were forced to fend for themselves in a world that was rapidly changing.\n\n## Hybrid Creatures\n\nAs a result of the virus, many humans have evolved into hybrid creatures with animal-like features.

facto rule, Mohammed became the ruler of Dubai on 4 January 2006, upon the death of his brother Maktoum [39] The following day, the Federal National Council selected him as the new vice president of the UAE On 11 February, the Council approved President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan's nomination of Sheikh Mohammed for prime minister [40] [41] [better source needed]\n\n\nSpace exploration\nMohammed

its \"epic challenge,\" [52] saying it would benefit the Emirati economy [53] He announced that the mission would be called Hope after a public vote, as the name would \"send a message of optimism to millions of young Arabs,\" [54] since \"Arab civilisation once played a great role in contributing to human knowledge, and  [would] play that role again.\" [55]\n\n\nBusiness career\nMohammed has overseen the creation and growth of a number of businesses and economic assets of Dubai, with a number held by two companies under his ownership, Dubai World and Dubai Holding According to the laws of Dubai, the ruling family owns all undeveloped land in Dubai, which has allowed the family to prosper from real estate development [4] During Mohammed's rule, Dubai has seen enormous population growth, causing a real estate boom in Dubai [65] The boom was in part facilitated by Sheikh Mohammed's 2002 decree that foreigners would be allowed to purchase property in Dubai [65]\n\n\nLaunch of Emirates Airline\nThrough the 1970s, as well as his role as head of Dubai Defence Force and UAE Minister of Defence, Mohammed oversaw Dubai's energy resources and was in charge of the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority It was in this latter role, in March 1985, that he founded Emirates Airline, [67] tasking then-head of Dnata, Maurice Flanagan, with launching a new airline to be called Emirates after a dispute with Gulf Air over Dubai's 'Open Skies' policy The launch budget of the airline was $10 million (the amount Flanagan said he needed to launch an airline) and its inaugural flight took place on 25 October 1985 [68] [69] Sheikh Mohammed appointed his uncle Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum as chairman of the new company A further $75 million in facilities and materials was provided, but Emirates has always maintained that it has received no further subsidies throughout the company's meteoric growth to become one of the world's leading airlines [68]\n\n\nBurj Al Arab and Jumeirah\nThe Burj Al Arab was inaugurated in December 1999 The hotel, constructed from a design by WS Atkins in response to a brief from Mohammed to create \"a truly iconic\" building, styles itself as \"the world's most luxurious hotel\" It was constructed on an island offshore from the Jumeirah Beach Hotel, the first property managed by Jumeirah, [71] the hotel management company launched by Mohammed in 1997 and headed by ex-Trust House Forte executive Gerald Lawless While work began on both hotels at the same time, the island to house the Burj Al Arab required three years to build before construction began above ground Jumeirah's international expansion, driven after it became part of Dubai Holding in 2004, [72] encompasses 22 hotels in ten countries [73]\n\n\nDubai Internet City and TECOM\nOn 29 October 1999, Mohammed announced Dubai Internet City, a technology hub and free trade zone Offering companies long leases, full ownership, and fast access to government services, DIC grew from its first tenants in October 2000, to a current zone employing about 15,000 people [74] [better source needed] In November 2000, it was joined by Dubai Media City, a content and media production-free zone, which is co-located with DIC The launch of DIC came with assurances from Mohammed regarding media freedoms In 2007, he issued a decree banning the imprisonment of journalists following an incident in which local journalists were accused of libel and sentenced to jail terms [75]\n\n\nPalm Islands\nThe Palm Islands were developed by Nakheel Properties, which Mohammed founded [67]\n\n\nInterests, activities and philanthropic work\nThe Mohammed bin Rashid Global Initiatives is a charitable foundation which consolidates the work of some 33 charitable foundations, entities and initiatives which, together, implement more than 1,400 development programs, including the Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Centre for Cultural Understanding (SMCCU) [76]

figure in international thoroughbred horse racing and breeding He owns Darley Stud, the biggest horse breeding operation in the world with farms in the United States, Ireland, England, and Australia In 1985 he bought the Irish thoroughbred Park Appeal for an undisclosed sum at the end of her second season She went on to produce at least nine winners from twelve foals and is the ancestor of many successful horses [82]\n\n\nControversies\nAn early 2000s British police investigation of allegations, made by a former riding instructor about the attempted escape of Mohammed's daughter Latifa (born 1985) from her family estate in England and the subsequent kidnapping on a street in Cambridge of Latifa's sister Shamsa in 2001, was inconclusive [98]\n\n\nSheikha Latifa and Sheikha Shamsa kidnap allegations\nAn early 2000s British police investigation of allegations, made by a former riding instructor about the attempted escape of Mohammed's daughter Latifa (born 1985) from her family estate in England and the subsequent kidnapping on a street in Cambridge of Latifa's sister Shamsa in 2001, was inconclusive [98]\n\n\nPrincess Haya escape\nIn June 2019, it was reported that Princess Haya had fled Dubai along with her two children, a son and a daughter, and was in Germany seeking political asylum [114] A subsequent poem composed by Mohammed (an occasional couplet-writer) and posted on Instagram alluded to betrayal in love [115] [116] In 2020, a 34-page fact-finding ruling by the UK High Court Family Division found that Princess Haya had been having an affair with her bodyguard [117] She paid around $9 million to hide the affair [118]\n\n\nChild camel jockeys\nIn 2006, a UNICEF-sponsored program with the UAE government resulted in the repatriation of hundreds of children formerly enslaved as camel jockeys, and provided them with social services and compensation upon return to their home countries of Pakistan, Sudan, Mauritania, and Bangladesh The UAE government set aside US$2.7 million in initial funding in 2005 with an additional $9 million for the second phase, and to enforce compliance, adopted a law officially banning the practice with penalties of jail time and a $27,200 fine [126] UNICEF endorsed the UAE's efforts and expressed the hopes that \"the UAE's programme will serve as a model to other countries in the region, as a means of ending all forms of exploitation of children\" [127]\n\n\nHorse racing drugs scandal\nIn April 2013, Mohammed's Godolphin stables trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni was disqualified for eight years from thoroughbred horse racing by the British Horseracing Authority for administering steroids to eleven racehorses Mohammed stated that he was \"appalled and angered\" by the case and announced that the stable would be locked down while drug tests were carried out on all horses under Al Zarooni's care [132] In May, Mohammed, as prime minister of the UAE, issued a decree outlawing and criminalizing the use of anabolic steroids on horses in the UAE [133]\n\n\nPandora Papers\nIn October 2021, an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) revealed that over 330 prominent politicians and public officials across the world had ties with offshore companies Amongst them were 35 current and former world leaders The leaked 11.9 million files revealed that Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum also

wider Arab Spring protests in the region [15] [16] Numerous protests were violently suppressed by security forces in deadly crackdowns ordered by Bashar al-Assad, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and detentions, many of whom were civilians [15] [16] The Syrian revolution transformed into an insurgency with the formation of resistance militias across the country, deteriorating into a

wider Arab Spring protests in the region [15] [16] Numerous protests were violently suppressed by security forces in deadly crackdowns ordered by Bashar al-Assad, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and detentions, many of whom were civilians [15] [16] The Syrian revolution transformed into an insurgency with the formation of resistance militias across the country, deteriorating into a full-blown civil war by 2012 [d]\n\n\nCourse of events\nThe war is fought by several factions The Syrian Arab Armed Forces, alongside its domestic and foreign allies, represent the Syrian Arab Republic and Assad government Opposed to it is the Syrian Interim Government, a big-tent alliance of pro-democratic, nationalist opposition groups (whose military forces consist of the Syrian National Army and allied Free Syrian militias) Another opposition faction is the Syrian Salvation Government, whose armed forces are represented by a coalition of Sunni militias led by Tahrir al-Sham Independent of them is the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, whose military force is the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a multi-ethnic, Arab-majority force led by the Kurdish YPG Other competing factions include Jihadist organizations such as the al-Qaeda-branch Hurras al-Din (successor of Al-Nusra Front) and the Islamic State (IS).\n\n\nCurrent situation\nIn October 2019, Kurdish leaders of Rojava, a region within Syria, announced they had reached a major deal with the government of Syria under Assad This deal was enacted in the wake of the U.S withdrawal from Syria The Kurdish leaders made this deal in order to obtain Syria's help in stopping hostile Turkish forces who were invading Syria and attacking Kurds [36] [37] [38]\n\n\nBackground\nThe non-religious Ba'ath Syrian Regional Branch government came to power through a coup d'état in 1963 For several years, Syria went through additional coups and changes in leadership, [43] until in March 1971, General Hafez al-Assad, an Alawite, declared himself President It marked the beginning of the domination of personality cults centred around the Assad dynasty that pervaded all aspects of Syrian daily life and was accompanied by a systematic suppression of civil and political freedoms, becoming the central feature of state propaganda Authority in Ba'athist Syria is monopolised by three power-centres: Alawite loyalist clans, Ba'ath party and the armed forces; glued together by unwavering allegiance towards the Assad dynasty [44] [45] [46]\n\n\nAssad government\nThe non-religious Ba'ath Syrian Regional Branch government came to power through a coup d'état in 1963 For several years, Syria went through additional coups and changes in leadership, [43] until in March 1971, General Hafez al-Assad, an Alawite, declared himself President It marked the beginning of the domination of personality cults centred around the Assad dynasty that pervaded all aspects of Syrian daily life and was accompanied by a systematic suppression of civil and political freedoms, becoming the central feature of state propaganda Authority in Ba'athist Syria is monopolised by three power-centres: Alawite loyalist clans, Ba'ath party and the armed forces; glued together by unwavering allegiance towards the Assad dynasty [44] [45] [46]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe total population in July 2018 was estimated at 19,454,263 people; ethnic groups—approximately Arab 50%, Alawite 15%, Kurd 10%, Levantine 10%, other 15% (includes Druze, Ismaili, Imami, Assyrian, Turkmen, Armenian); religions—Muslim 87% (official; includes Sunni 74% and Alawi, Ismaili and Shia 13%), Christian 10% (mainly of Eastern Christian churches [54]—may be smaller as a result of Christians fleeing the country), Druze 3% and Jewish (few remaining in Damascus and Aleppo) [55]\n\n\nSocioeconomic background\nSocioeconomic inequality increased significantly after free market policies were initiated by Hafez al-Assad in his later years, and it accelerated after Bashar al-Assad came to power With an emphasis on the service sector, these policies benefited a minority of the nation's population, mostly people who had connections with the government, and members of the Sunni merchant class of Damascus and Aleppo [56] In 2010, Syria's nominal GDP per capita was only $2,834, comparable to Sub-Saharan African countries such as Nigeria and far lower than its neighbors such as Lebanon, with an annual growth rate of 3.39%, below most other developing countries [57]\n\n\nDrought\nThis coincided with the most intense drought ever recorded in Syria, which lasted from 2006 to 2011 and resulted in widespread crop failure, an increase in food prices and a mass migration of farming families to urban centers [59] This migration strained infrastructure already burdened by the influx of some 1.5 million refugees from the Iraq War [60] The drought has been linked to anthropogenic global warming [61] [62] [63] Subsequent analysis, however, has challenged the narrative of the drought as a major contributor to the start of the war [64] [65] [66] Adequate water supply continues to be an issue in the ongoing civil war and it is frequently the target of military action [67]\n\n\nHuman rights\nThe human rights situation in Syria has long been the subject of harsh critique from global organizations [68] The rights of free expression, association and assembly were strictly controlled in Syria even before the uprising [69] The country was under emergency rule from 1963 until 2011 and public gatherings of more than five people were banned [70] Security forces had sweeping powers of arrest and detention [71] Despite hopes for democratic change with the 2000 Damascus Spring, Bashar al-Assad was widely reported as having failed to implement any improvements In 2010, he imposed a controversial national ban on female Islamic dress codes (such as face veils) across universities, where reportedly over a thousand primary school teachers that wore the niqab were reassigned to administrative jobs [72] A Human Rights Watch report issued just before the beginning of the 2011 uprising stated that Assad had failed to substantially improve the state of human rights since taking power [73]\n\n\nImpact of natural gas\nThe United States and its allies intended to build the Qatar–Turkey pipeline which would relieve Europe of its dependence on Russian natural gas, especially during winter months where many European homes rely on Russia to survive the winter On the contrary, Russia and its allies intended to stop this planned pipeline and instead build the Iran–Iraq–Syria pipeline [74] [75] Syrian president Bashar al-Assad declined Qatar's year 2000 proposal to build a $10 billion Qatar–Turkey pipeline through Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria and Turkey, allegedly prompting covert CIA operations to spark a Syrian civil war to pressure Bashar al-Assad to resign and allow a pro-American president to step in and sign off on the deal Leaked documents have shown that in 2009, the CIA began funding and supporting opposition groups in Syria to foment a civil war [76] [75]\n\n\nTimeline\nProtests, civil uprising, and defections (March–July 2011)\n\n\nBelligerents\nThere are numerous factions, both foreign and domestic, involved in the Syrian civil war These can be divided into four main groups First, Ba'athist Syria led by Bashar al-Assad and backed by his Russian and Iranian allies Second, the Syrian opposition consisting of two alternative governments: i) the Syrian Interim Government, a big-tent coalition of democratic, Syrian nationalist and Islamic political groups whose defense forces consist of the Syrian National Army [81] and Free Syrian Army, and ii) the Syrian Salvation Government, a Sunni Islamist coalition led by Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham [82] Third, the Kurdish-dominated Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria and its military-wing Syrian Democratic Forces supported by the United States, France and other coalition allies [83] Fourth, the Global Jihadist camp consisting of al-Qaeda affiliate Guardians of Religion Organisation and its rival Islamic State [84] The Syrian government, the opposition and the SDF have all received support—militarily, logistically and diplomatically—from foreign countries, leading the conflict to often be described as a proxy war [85]\n\n\nSyrian factions\nThere are numerous factions, both foreign and domestic, involved in the Syrian civil war These can be divided into four main groups First,

[84] The Syrian government, the opposition and the SDF have all received support—militarily, logistically and diplomatically—from foreign countries, leading the conflict to often be described as a proxy war [85]\n\n\nForeign involvement\nThe major parties supporting the Syrian government are Iran, [86] Russia [87] and Lebanese militia Hezbollah Syrian rebel groups received political, logistic and military support from the United States, [88] [89] Turkey, [90] Saudi Arabia, [91] Qatar, [92] Britain, France, [93] Israel, [94] [95] and the Netherlands [96] Under the aegis of operation Timber Sycamore and other clandestine activities, CIA operatives and U.S special operations troops have trained and armed nearly 10,000 rebel fighters at a cost of $1 billion a year since 2012 [97] [98] Iraq had also been involved in supporting the Syrian government, but mostly against ISIL [99]\n\n\nSpillover\nIn June 2014, members of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) crossed the border from Syria into northern Iraq, and took control of large swaths of Iraqi territory as the Iraqi Army abandoned its positions Fighting between rebels and government forces also spilled over into Lebanon on several occasions There were repeated incidents of sectarian violence in the North Governorate of Lebanon between supporters and opponents of the Syrian government, as well as armed clashes between Sunnis and Alawites in Tripoli [104]\n\n\nWeaponry and warfare\nSarin, mustard agent and chlorine gas have been used during the conflict Numerous casualties led to an international reaction, especially the 2013 Ghouta chemical attack A UN fact-finding mission was requested to investigate reported chemical weapons attacks In four cases UN inspectors confirmed the use of sarin gas [106] In August 2016, a confidential report by the United Nations and the OPCW explicitly blamed the Syrian military of Bashar al-Assad for dropping chemical weapons (chlorine bombs) on the towns of Talmenes in April 2014 and Sarmin in March 2015 and ISIS for using sulfur mustard on the town of Marea in August 2015 [107]\n\n\nChemical weapons\nSarin, mustard agent and chlorine gas have been used during the conflict Numerous casualties led to an international reaction, especially the 2013 Ghouta chemical attack A UN fact-finding mission was requested to investigate reported chemical weapons attacks In four cases UN inspectors confirmed the use of sarin gas [106] In August 2016, a confidential report by the United Nations and the OPCW explicitly blamed the Syrian military of Bashar al-Assad for dropping chemical weapons (chlorine bombs) on the towns of Talmenes in April 2014 and Sarmin in March 2015 and ISIS for using sulfur mustard on the town of Marea in August 2015 [107]\n\n\nCluster bombs\nSyria is not a party to the Convention on Cluster Munitions and does not recognize the ban on the use of cluster bombs The Syrian Army is reported to have begun using cluster bombs in September 2012 Steve Goose, director of the Arms Division at Human Rights Watch said \"Syria is expanding its relentless use of cluster munitions, a banned weapon, and civilians are paying the price with their lives and limbs\", \"The initial toll is only the beginning because cluster munitions often leave unexploded bomblets that kill and maim long afterward\" [118]\n\n\nThermobaric weapons\nRussian thermobaric weapons, also known as \"fuel-air bombs\", were used by the government side during the war On 2 December 2015, The National Interest reported that Russia was deploying the TOS-1 Buratino multiple rocket launch system to Syria, which is \"designed to launch massive thermobaric charges against infantry in confined spaces such as urban areas\" [119] One Buratino thermobaric rocket launcher \"can obliterate a roughly 200 by 400 metres (660 by 1,310 feet) area with a single salvo\" [120] Since 2012, rebels have said that the Syrian Air Force (government forces) is using thermobaric weapons against residential areas occupied by the rebel fighters, such as during the Battle of Aleppo and also in Kafr Batna [121] A panel of United Nations human rights investigators reported that the Syrian government used thermobaric bombs against the strategic town of Qusayr in March 2013 [122] In August 2013, the BBC reported on the use of napalm-like incendiary bombs on a school in northern Syria [123]\n\n\nAnti-tank missiles\nSeveral types of anti-tank missiles are in use in Syria Russia has sent 9M133 Kornet, third-generation anti-tank guided missiles to the Syrian government whose forces have used them extensively against armour and other ground targets to fight jihadists and rebels [124] U.S.-made BGM-71 TOW missiles are one of the primary weapons of rebel groups and have been primarily provided by the United States and Saudi Arabia [125] The U.S has also supplied many Eastern European sourced 9K111 Fagot launchers and warheads to Syrian rebel groups under its Timber Sycamore program [126]\n\n\nBallistic missiles\nIn June 2017, Iran attacked ISIL targets in the Deir ez-Zor area in eastern Syria with Zolfaghar ballistic missiles fired from western Iran, [127] in the first use of mid-range missiles by Iran in 30 years [128] According to Jane's Defence Weekly, the missiles travelled 650–700 kilometres [127]\n\n\nWar crimes\nIn 2022, a German court sentenced Anwar Raslan, 58, a high-ranking official of President Bashar al-Assad's regime to life imprisonment after he sought asylum in Germany and was arrested in 2019 He was charged with being complicit to the murder of at least 27 people coupled with the sexual assault and torture of at least another 4,000 people between 29 April 2011, and 7 September 2012 Raslan was a mid-level officer in Branch 251 and oversaw the torture of detainees His trial was one of an unprecedented nature because Germany took on a trial of crimes committed in the Syrian war and the human rights lawyers took this on under the principle of \"universal jurisdiction\" Universal Jurisdiction is a concept in German law that allows for serious crimes to be tried in Germany even if they did not happen in the country His co-defendant Eyad al-Gharib, 44, a low-level officer in Branch 251 was also sentenced to 4 years and 6 months in prison on 24 February 2021 Eyad's duties included the transport of detainees to location where they would be tortured for days on end It was his knowledge of the fact that torture was happening there that landed him the sentence [129] [130]\n\n\nSectarianism\nThe successive governments of Hafez and Bashar al-Assad have been closely associated with the country's minority Alawite religious group [131] an offshoot of Shia, whereas the majority of the population, and most of the opposition, is Sunni This resulted in calls for persecution of the Alawites by parts of the opposition [131]\n\n\nKurdish autonomy in northeastern Syria\nThe Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES), also known as Rojava, [e] is a de facto autonomous region in northeastern Syria [139] [140] The region does not claim to pursue full independence but autonomy within a federal and democratic Syria [141] Rojava consists of self-governing sub-regions in the areas of Afrin, Jazira, Euphrates, Raqqa, Tabqa, Manbij and Deir Ez-Zor [142] [143] The region gained its de facto autonomy in 2012 in the context of the ongoing Rojava conflict, in which its official military force, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), has taken part [144] [145]\n\n\nHumanitarian impact\nAs of 2015 [update], 3.8 million have been made refugees [200] As of 2013 [update], one in three of Syrian refugees (about 667,000 people) sought safety in Lebanon (normally 4.8 million population) [201] Others have fled to Jordan, Turkey and Iraq Turkey has accepted 1.7 million (2015) Syrian refugees, half of whom are spread around cities and a dozen camps placed under the direct authority of the Turkish Government Satellite images confirmed that the first Syrian camps appeared in Turkey in July 2011, shortly after the towns of Deraa, Homs and Hama were besieged [202] In September 2014, the UN stated that the number of Syrian refugees had exceeded three million [203] According to the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, Sunnis are leaving for Lebanon and undermining Hezbollah's status The Syrian refugee crisis has caused the \"Jordan is Palestine\" threat to be diminished due to the onslaught of new refugees in Jordan Greek Catholic Patriarch Gregorios III Laham says more than 450,000 Syrian Christians have been displaced by the conflict [204] As of September 2016 [update], the European Union has reported that there are 13.5 million refugees in need of assistance in the country [205] Australia is being appealed to rescue more than 60 women and children stuck in Syria's Al-Hawl camp ahead of a potential Turkish invasion [206]\n\n\nRefugees\nAs of 2015 [update], 3.8 million have been made refugees [200] As of 2013 [update], one in three of Syrian refugees (about 667,000 people) sought safety in Lebanon (normally 4.8 million population) [201] Others have fled to Jordan, Turkey and Iraq Turkey has accepted 1.7 million (2015) Syrian refugees, half of whom are spread around cities and a dozen camps placed under the direct authority of the Turkish Government Satellite images confirmed that the first Syrian camps appeared in Turkey in July 2011, shortly after the towns of Deraa, Homs and Hama were besieged [202] In September 2014, the UN stated that the number of Syrian refugees had exceeded three million [203] According to the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, Sunnis are leaving for Lebanon and undermining Hezbollah's status The Syrian refugee crisis has caused the \"Jordan is Palestine\" threat to be diminished due to the onslaught of new refugees in Jordan Greek Catholic Patriarch

refugees in need of assistance in the country [205] Australia is being appealed to rescue more than 60 women and children stuck in Syria's Al-Hawl camp ahead of a potential Turkish invasion [206]\n\n\nReturn of refugees\nAnother aspect of the post-war years will be how to repatriate the millions of refugees The Syrian government has put forward a law commonly known as \"law 10\", which could strip refugees of property, such as damaged real estate There are also fears among some refugees that if they return to claim this property they will face negative consequences, such as forced conscription or prison The Syrian government has been criticized for using this law to reward those who have supported the government However, the government said this statement was false and has expressed that it wants the return of refugees from Lebanon [216] [217] In December 2018, it was also reported that the Syrian government has started to seize property under an anti-terrorism law, which is affecting government opponents negatively, with many losing their property Some people's pensions have also been cancelled [218]\n\n\nInternally displaced refugees\nThe violence in Syria caused millions to flee their homes As of March 2015, Al-Jazeera estimate 10.9 million Syrians, or almost half the population, have been displaced [200] Violence erupted due to the ongoing crisis in northwest Syria has forced 6,500 children to flee every day over the last week of January 2020 The recorded count of displaced children in the area has reached more than 300,000 since December 2019 [229]\n\n\nCasualties\nOn 2 January 2013, the United Nations stated that 60,000 had been killed since the civil war began, with UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay saying \"The number of casualties is much higher than we expected, and is truly shocking\" [233] Four months later, the UN's updated figure for the death toll had reached 80,000 [234] On 13 June 2013, the UN released an updated figure of people killed since fighting began, the figure being exactly 92,901, for up to the end of April 2013 Navi Pillay, UN high commissioner for human rights, stated that: \"This is most likely a minimum casualty figure\" The real toll was guessed to be over 100,000 [235] [236] Some areas of the country have been affected disproportionately by the war; by some estimates, as many as a third of all deaths have occurred in the city of Homs [237]\n\n\nHuman rights violations\nUnited Nations and human rights organizations have asserted that human rights violations have been committed by both the government and the rebel forces, with the \"vast majority of the abuses having been committed by the Syrian government\" [268] Numerous human rights abuses, political repression, war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Assad government throughout the course of the conflict has led to international condemnation and widespread calls to convict Bashar al-Assad in the International Criminal Court (ICC) [g] The unprecedented scale of the atrocities launched by government forces since the outbreak of the Syrian revolution has led to international outrage, and Syria's membership was suspended from various international organizations [274] [275]\n\n\nCrime wave\nAs the conflict has expanded across Syria, many cities have been engulfed in a wave of crime as fighting caused the disintegration of much of the civilian state, and many police stations stopped functioning Rates of theft increased, with criminals looting houses and stores Rates of kidnappings increased as well Rebel fighters were seen stealing cars and, in one instance, destroying a restaurant in Aleppo where Syrian soldiers had been seen eating [303]\n\n\nEpidemics\nThe World Health Organization has reported that 35% of the country's hospitals are out of service Fighting makes it impossible to undertake the normal vaccination programs The displaced refugees may also pose a disease risk to countries to which they have fled [307] Four hundred thousand civilians were isolated by the Siege of Eastern Ghouta from April 2013 to April 2018, resulting in acutely malnourished children according to the United Nations Special Advisor, Jan Egeland, who urged the parties for medical evacuations 55,000 civilians are also isolated in the Rukban refugee camp between Syria and Jordan, where humanitarian relief access is difficult due to the harsh desert conditions Humanitarian aid reaches the camp only sporadically, sometimes taking three months between shipments [308] [309]\n\n\nHumanitarian aid\nThe conflict holds the record for the largest sum ever requested by UN agencies for a single humanitarian emergency, $6.5 billion worth of requests of December 2013 [313] The international humanitarian response to the conflict in Syria is coordinated by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) in accordance with General Assembly Resolution 46/182 [314] The primary framework for this coordination is the Syria Humanitarian Assistance Response Plan (SHARP) which appealed for US$1.41 billion to meet the humanitarian needs of Syrians affected by the conflict [315] Official United Nations data on the humanitarian situation and response is available at an official website managed by UNOCHA Syria (Amman) [316] UNICEF is also working alongside these organizations to provide vaccinations and care packages to those in need Financial information on the response to the SHARP and assistance to refugees and for cross-border operations can be found on UNOCHA's Financial Tracking Service As of 19 September 2015, the top ten donors to Syria were United States, European Commission, United Kingdom, Kuwait, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Japan, UAE and Norway [317]\n\n\n2019 UN cross-border aid dispute\nAs of December 2019, a diplomatic dispute is occurring at the UN over re-authorization of cross-border aid for refugees China and Russia oppose the draft resolution that seeks to re-authorize crossing points in Turkey, Iraq and Jordan; China and Russia, as allies of Assad, seek to close the two crossing points in Iraq and Jordan, and to leave only the two crossing points in Turkey active [328] The current authorization expired on 10 January 2020 [329]\n\n\nCultural impact\nAs of March 2015 [update], the war has affected 290 heritage sites, severely damaged 104, and completely destroyed 24 [needs update] Five of the six UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Syria have been damaged [200] Destruction of antiquities has been caused by shelling, army entrenchment, and looting at various tells, museums and monuments [336] A group called Syrian Archaeological Heritage Under Threat is monitoring and recording the destruction in an attempt to create a list of heritage sites damaged during the war and to gain global support for the protection and preservation of Syrian archaeology and architecture [337]\n\n\nMedia coverage\nThe Syrian civil war is one of the most heavily documented wars in history, despite the extreme dangers that journalists face while in Syria [347]\n\n\nISIL executions\nOn 19 August 2014, American journalist James Foley was executed by ISIL, who said it was in retaliation for the United States operations in Iraq Foley was kidnapped in Syria in November 2012 by Shabiha militia [348] ISIL also threatened to execute Steven Sotloff, who was kidnapped at the Syrian–Turkish border in August 2013 [349] There were reports ISIS captured a Japanese national, two Italian nationals, and a Danish national as well [350] Sotloff was later executed in September 2014 At least 70 journalists have been killed covering the Syrian war, and more than 80 kidnapped, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists [351] On 22 August 2014, the al-Nusra Front released a video of captured Lebanese soldiers and demanded Hezbollah withdraw from Syria under threat of their execution [352]\n\n\nInternational reactions and diplomacy\nDuring the early period of the civil war, The Arab League, European Union, the United Nations, [353] and many Western governments quickly condemned the Syrian government's violent response to the protests, and expressed support for the protesters' right to exercise free speech [354] Initially, many Middle Eastern governments expressed support for Assad, but as the death toll mounted, they switched to a more balanced approach by criticizing violence from both government and protesters Both the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation suspended Syria's membership Russia and China vetoed Western-drafted United Nations Security Council resolutions in 2011 and 2012, which would have threatened the Syrian government with targeted sanctions if it continued military actions against protestors [355]\n\n\nEconomic sanctions\nThe U.S Congress has enacted punitive sanctions on the Syrian government for its actions during the Civil War These sanctions would penalize any entities lending support to the Syrian government, and any companies operating in Syria [356] [357] [358] [359] U.S President Donald Trump tried to protect the Turkish President Erdogan from the effects of such sanctions [360]\n\n\n2019 negotiations\nDuring the course of the war, there have been several international peace initiatives, undertaken by the Arab League, the United Nations and other actors [367] The Syrian government has refused efforts to negotiate with what it describes as armed terrorist groups [368] On 1 February 2016, the UN announced the formal start of the UN-mediated Geneva Syria peace talks [369] that had been agreed on by the International Syria Support Group (ISSG) in Vienna On 3 February 2016, the UN Syria peace mediator suspended the talks [370] On 14 March 2016, Geneva peace talks resumed The Syrian government stated that discussion of Bashar-al-Assad's presidency \"is a red line\", however Syria's President Bashar al-Assad said he hoped peace talks in Geneva would lead to concrete results, and stressed the need for a political process in Syria [371]\n\n\nBuffer zone with Turkey\nIn October 2019, in response to the Turkish offensive, Russia arranged for negotiations between the Syrian government in Damascus and the Kurdish-led forces [379] Russia also negotiated a renewal of a cease-fire between Kurds and Turkey that was about to expire [380]\n\n\nSyrian Constitutional Committee\nIn late 2019, a new Syrian Constitutional Committee began operating in order to discuss a new settlement and to draft a new constitution for Syria [392] [393] This committee comprises about 150 members It includes representatives of the Syrian government, opposition groups and countries serving as guarantors of the process, such as Russia However, this committee has faced strong opposition from the Assad government Fifty of the committee members represent the government, and 50 members represent the opposition [393] Until the Assad government agrees to participate, it is unclear whether the third round of talks will proceed on a firm schedule [393]\n\n\nArab League\nOn 13 April 2023, Syrian Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad arrived in Jeddah to meet Saudi foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan After frayed relations during the Syrian civil war, both nations now seek \"a political solution to the Syrian crisis that preserves the unity, security and stability of Syria\", according to the Saudi foreign ministry The high level talks are \"facilitating the return of Syrian refugees to their homeland, and securing humanitarian access to the affected areas in Syria\" Al-Assad previously visited the UAE, Oman as well as Saudi Arabia The discussion also included the possible resumption of consular services between the two countries This is the first visit to Saudi Arabia by a Syrian foreign minister since the onset of the civil war in 2011 The same week all foreign ministers of the Arab League would meet again to discuss the return of Syria to the regional organisation [398] [399]\n\n\nReconstruction\nUnited Nations authorities have estimated that the war in Syria has caused destruction reaching to about $400 billion [400] SNHR reported in 2017 that the war has rendered around 39% of Syrian mosques unserviceable for worship More than 13,500 mosques were destroyed in Syria between 2011 and 2017 Around 1,400 were dismantled by 2013, while 13,000 mosques got demolished between 2013 and 2017 [401] According to a Syrian war monitor, over 120 churches have been damaged or demolished by during the course of Syrian war since 2011; and 60% of these attacks were perpetrated by pro-Assad forces [402]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther

the Ba'athist government of Bashar al-Assad. The war has since escalated into a full-blown civil war, with various factions and external powers involved.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Ba'ath Syrian Regional Branch government came to power through a coup d'état in 1963. For several years, Syria went through additional coups and changes in leadership, until in March 1971, General Hafez al-Assad, an Alawite, declared himself President. This marked the beginning of the domination of personality cults centered around the Assad dynasty, which pervaded all aspects of Syrian daily life and was accompanied by a systematic suppression of civil and political freedoms.\n\n**Origins of War**\n\nIn March 2011, popular discontent with the Ba'athist government led to large-scale protests and pro-democracy rallies across Syria, as part of the wider Arab Spring protests in the region. Numerous protests were violently suppressed by security forces in deadly crackdowns ordered by Bashar al-Assad, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and detentions, many of whom were civilians.\n\n**Course of Events**\n\nThe war is fought by several factions. The Syrian Arab Armed Forces, alongside its domestic and foreign allies, represent the Syrian Arab Republic and Assad government. Opposed to it is the Syrian Interim Government, a big-tent alliance of pro-democratic, nationalist opposition groups (whose military forces consist of the Syrian National Army and allied Free Syrian militias). Another opposition faction is the Syrian Salvation Government, whose armed forces are represented by a coalition of Sunni militias led by Tahrir al-Sham. Independent of them is the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, whose military force is the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a multi-ethnic, Arab-majority force led by the Kurdish YPG. Other competing factions include jihadist organizations such as the al-Qaeda-branch Hurras al-Din (successor of Al-Nusra Front) and the Islamic State (IS).\n\n**Current Situation**\n\nIn October 2019, Kurdish leaders of Rojava, a region within Syria, announced they had reached a major deal with the government of Syria under Assad. This deal was enacted in the wake of the U.S withdrawal from Syria. The Kurdish leaders made this deal in order to obtain Syria's help in stopping hostile Turkish forces who were invading Syria and attacking Kurds.\n\n**Foreign Involvement**\n\nThe major parties supporting the Syrian government are Iran, Russia, and Lebanese militia Hezbollah. Syrian rebel groups received political, logistic, and military support from the United States, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Britain, France, Israel, and the Netherlands. Under the aegis of operation Timber Sycamore and other clandestine activities, CIA operatives and U.S special operations troops have trained and armed nearly 10,000 rebel fighters at a cost of $1 billion a year since 2012.\n\n**Spillover**\n\nIn June 2014, members of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) crossed the border from Syria into northern Iraq, and took control of large swaths of Iraqi territory as the Iraqi Army abandoned its positions. Fighting between rebels and government forces also spilled over into Lebanon on several occasions. There were repeated incidents of sectarian violence in the North Governorate of Lebanon between supporters and opponents of the Syrian government, as well as armed clashes between Sunnis and Alawites in Tripoli.\n\n**Weaponry and Warfare**\n\nSarin, mustard agent, and chlorine gas have been used during the conflict. Numerous casualties led to an international reaction, especially the 2013 Ghouta chemical attack. A UN fact-finding mission was requested to investigate reported chemical weapons attacks. In four cases, UN inspectors confirmed the use of sarin gas. In August 2016, a confidential report by the United Nations and the OPCW explicitly blamed the Syrian military of Bashar al-Assad for dropping chemical weapons (chlorine bombs) on the towns of Talmenes in April 2014 and Sarmin in March 2015 and ISIS for using sulfur mustard on the town of Marea in August 2015.\n\n**Humanitarian Impact**\n\nAs of 2015, 3.8 million have been made refugees. As of 2013, one in three of Syrian refugees (about 667,000 people) sought safety in Lebanon (normally 4.8 million population). Others have fled to Jordan, Turkey, and Iraq. Turkey has accepted 1.7 million (2015) Syrian refugees, half of whom are spread around cities and a dozen camps placed under the direct authority of the Turkish Government. Satellite images confirmed that the first Syrian camps appeared in Turkey in July 2011, shortly after the towns of Deraa, Homs, and Hama were besieged.\n\n**Refugees**\n\nThe Syrian refugee crisis has caused the \"Jordan is Palestine\" threat to be diminished due to the onslaught of new refugees in Jordan. Greek Catholic Patriarch Gregorios III Laham says more than 450,000 Syrian Christians have been displaced by the conflict. As of September 2016, the European Union has reported that there are 13.5 million refugees in need of assistance in the country. Australia is being appealed to rescue more than 60 women and children stuck in Syria's Al-Hawl camp ahead of a potential Turkish invasion.\n\n**Internally Displaced Refugees**\n\nThe violence in Syria caused millions to flee their homes. As of March 2015, Al-Jazeera estimate 10.9 million Syrians, or almost half the population, have been displaced. Violence erupted due to the ongoing crisis in northwest Syria has forced 6,500 children to flee every day over the last week of January 2020.

government came to power through a coup d'état in 1963 For several years, Syria went through additional coups and changes in leadership, [43] until in March 1971, General Hafez al-Assad, an Alawite, declared himself President It marked the beginning of the domination of personality cults centred around the Assad dynasty that pervaded all aspects of Syrian daily life and was accompanied by a systematic suppression of civil and political freedoms, becoming the central feature of state propaganda Authority in Ba'athist Syria is monopolised by three power-centres: Alawite loyalist clans, Ba'ath party and the armed forces; glued together by unwavering allegiance towards the Assad dynasty [44] [45] [46]\n\n\nAssad government\nThe non-religious Ba'ath Syrian Regional Branch government

suppression of civil and political freedoms, becoming the central feature of state propaganda Authority in Ba'athist Syria is monopolised by three power-centres: Alawite loyalist clans, Ba'ath party and the armed forces; glued together by unwavering allegiance towards the Assad dynasty [44] [45] [46]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe total population in July 2018 was estimated at 19,454,263 people; ethnic groups—approximately Arab 50%, Alawite 15%, Kurd 10%, Levantine 10%, other 15% (includes Druze, Ismaili, Imami, Assyrian, Turkmen, Armenian); religions—Muslim 87% (official; includes Sunni 74% and Alawi, Ismaili and Shia 13%), Christian 10% (mainly of Eastern Christian churches [54]—may be smaller as a result of Christians fleeing the country), Druze 3% and Jewish (few remaining in Damascus and Aleppo) [55]\n\n\nSocioeconomic background\nSocioeconomic inequality increased significantly after free market policies were initiated by Hafez al-Assad in his later years, and it accelerated after Bashar al-Assad came to power With an emphasis on the service sector, these policies benefited a minority of the nation's population, mostly people who had connections with the government, and members of the Sunni merchant class of Damascus and Aleppo [56] In 2010, Syria's nominal GDP per capita was only $2,834, comparable to Sub-Saharan African countries such as Nigeria and far lower than its neighbors such as Lebanon, with an annual growth rate of 3.39%, below most other developing countries [57]\n\n\nDrought\nThis coincided with the most intense drought ever recorded in Syria, which lasted from 2006 to 2011 and resulted in widespread crop failure, an increase in food prices and a mass migration of farming families to urban centers [59] This migration strained infrastructure already burdened by the influx of some 1.5 million refugees from the Iraq War [60] The drought has been linked to anthropogenic global warming [61] [62] [63] Subsequent analysis, however, has challenged the narrative of the drought as a major contributor to the start of the war [64] [65] [66] Adequate water supply continues to be an issue in the ongoing civil war and it is frequently the target of military action [67]\n\n\nHuman rights\nThe human rights situation in Syria has long been the subject of harsh critique from global organizations [68] The rights of free expression, association and assembly were strictly controlled in Syria even before the uprising [69] The country was under emergency rule from 1963 until 2011 and public gatherings of more than five people were banned [70] Security forces had sweeping powers of arrest and detention [71] Despite hopes for democratic change with the 2000 Damascus Spring, Bashar al-Assad was widely reported as having failed to implement any improvements In 2010, he imposed a controversial national ban on female Islamic dress codes (such as face veils) across universities, where reportedly over a thousand primary school teachers that wore the niqab were reassigned to administrative jobs [72] A Human Rights Watch report issued just before the beginning of the 2011 uprising stated that Assad had failed to substantially improve the state of human rights since taking power [73]\n\n\nImpact of natural gas\nThe United States and its allies intended to build the Qatar–Turkey pipeline which would relieve Europe of its dependence on Russian natural gas, especially during winter months where many European homes rely on Russia to survive the winter On the contrary, Russia and its allies intended to stop this planned pipeline and instead build the Iran–Iraq–Syria pipeline [74] [75] Syrian president Bashar al-Assad declined Qatar's year 2000 proposal to build a $10 billion Qatar–Turkey pipeline through Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria and Turkey, allegedly prompting covert CIA operations to spark a Syrian civil war to pressure Bashar al-Assad to resign and allow a pro-American president to step in and sign off on the deal Leaked documents have shown that in 2009, the CIA began funding and supporting opposition groups in Syria to foment a civil war [76] [75]\n\n\nTimeline\nProtests, civil uprising, and defections (March–July 2011)\n\n\nBelligerents\nThere are numerous factions, both foreign and domestic, involved in the Syrian civil war These can be divided into four main groups First, Ba'athist Syria led by Bashar al-Assad and backed by his Russian and Iranian allies Second, the Syrian opposition consisting of two alternative governments: i) the Syrian Interim Government, a big-tent coalition of democratic, Syrian nationalist and Islamic political groups whose defense forces consist of the Syrian National Army [81] and Free Syrian Army, and ii) the Syrian Salvation Government, a Sunni Islamist coalition led by Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham [82] Third, the Kurdish-dominated Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria and its military-wing Syrian Democratic Forces supported by the United States, France and other coalition allies [83] Fourth, the Global Jihadist camp consisting of al-Qaeda affiliate Guardians of Religion Organisation and its rival Islamic State [84] The Syrian government, the opposition and the SDF have all received support—militarily, logistically and diplomatically—from foreign countries, leading the conflict to often be described as a proxy war

United States, [88] [89] Turkey, [90] Saudi Arabia, [91] Qatar, [92] Britain, France, [93] Israel, [94] [95] and the Netherlands [96] Under the aegis of operation Timber Sycamore and other clandestine activities, CIA operatives and U.S special operations troops have trained and armed nearly 10,000 rebel fighters at a cost of $1 billion a year since 2012 [97] [98] Iraq had also been involved in supporting the Syrian government, but mostly against ISIL [99]\n\n\nSpillover\nIn June 2014, members of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) crossed the border from Syria into northern Iraq, and took control of large swaths of Iraqi territory as the Iraqi Army abandoned its positions Fighting between rebels and government forces also spilled over into Lebanon on several occasions There were repeated incidents of sectarian violence in the North Governorate of Lebanon between supporters and opponents of the Syrian government, as well as armed clashes between Sunnis and Alawites in Tripoli [104]\n\n\nWeaponry and warfare\nSarin, mustard agent and chlorine gas have been used during the conflict Numerous casualties led to an international reaction, especially the 2013 Ghouta chemical attack A UN fact-finding mission was requested to investigate reported chemical weapons attacks In four cases UN inspectors confirmed the use of sarin gas [106] In August 2016, a confidential report by the United Nations and the OPCW explicitly blamed the Syrian military of Bashar al-Assad for dropping chemical weapons (chlorine bombs) on the towns of Talmenes in April 2014 and Sarmin in March 2015 and ISIS for using sulfur mustard on the town of Marea in August 2015 [107]\n\n\nChemical weapons\nSarin, mustard agent and chlorine gas have been used during the conflict Numerous casualties led to an international reaction, especially the 2013 Ghouta chemical attack A UN fact-finding mission was requested to investigate reported chemical weapons attacks In four cases UN inspectors confirmed the use of sarin gas [106] In August 2016, a confidential report by the United Nations and the OPCW explicitly blamed the Syrian military of Bashar al-Assad for dropping chemical weapons (chlorine bombs) on the towns of Talmenes in April 2014 and Sarmin in March 2015 and ISIS for using sulfur mustard on the town of Marea in August 2015 [107]\n\n\nCluster bombs\nSyria is not a party to the Convention on Cluster Munitions and does not recognize the ban on the use of cluster bombs The Syrian Army is reported to have begun using cluster bombs in September 2012 Steve Goose, director of the Arms Division at Human Rights Watch said \"Syria is expanding its relentless use of cluster munitions, a banned weapon, and civilians are paying the price with their lives and limbs\", \"The initial toll is only the beginning because cluster munitions often leave unexploded bomblets that kill and maim long afterward\" [118]\n\n\nThermobaric weapons\nRussian thermobaric weapons, also known as \"fuel-air bombs\", were used by the government side during the war On 2 December 2015, The National Interest reported that Russia was deploying the TOS-1 Buratino multiple rocket launch system to Syria, which is \"designed to launch massive thermobaric charges against infantry in confined spaces such as urban areas\" [119] One Buratino thermobaric rocket launcher \"can obliterate a roughly 200 by 400 metres (660 by 1,310 feet) area with a single salvo\" [120] Since 2012, rebels have said that the Syrian Air Force (government forces) is using thermobaric weapons against residential areas occupied by the rebel fighters, such as during the Battle of Aleppo and also in Kafr Batna [121] A panel of United Nations human rights investigators reported that the Syrian government used thermobaric bombs against the strategic town of Qusayr in March 2013 [122] In August 2013, the BBC reported on the use of napalm-like incendiary bombs on a school in northern Syria [123]\n\n\nAnti-tank missiles\nSeveral types of anti-tank missiles are in use in Syria Russia has sent 9M133 Kornet, third-generation anti-tank guided missiles to the Syrian government whose forces have used them extensively against armour and other ground targets to fight jihadists and rebels [124] U.S.-made BGM-71 TOW missiles are one of the primary weapons of rebel groups and have been primarily provided by the United States and Saudi Arabia [125] The U.S has also supplied many Eastern European sourced 9K111 Fagot launchers and warheads to Syrian rebel groups under its Timber Sycamore program [126]\n\n\nBallistic missiles\nIn June 2017, Iran attacked ISIL targets in the Deir ez-Zor area in eastern Syria with Zolfaghar ballistic missiles fired from western Iran, [127] in the first use of mid-range missiles by Iran in 30 years [128] According to Jane's Defence Weekly, the missiles travelled 650–700 kilometres [127]\n\n\nWar crimes\nIn 2022, a German court sentenced Anwar Raslan, 58, a high-ranking official of President Bashar al-Assad's regime to life imprisonment after he sought asylum in Germany and was arrested in 2019 He was charged with being complicit to the murder of at least 27 people coupled with the sexual assault and torture of at least another 4,000 people between 29 April 2011, and 7 September 2012 Raslan was a mid-level officer in Branch 251 and oversaw the torture of detainees His trial was one of an unprecedented nature because Germany took on a trial of crimes committed in the Syrian war and the human rights lawyers took this on under the principle of \"universal jurisdiction\" Universal Jurisdiction is a concept in German law that allows for serious crimes to be tried in Germany even if they did not happen in the country His co-defendant Eyad al-Gharib, 44, a low-level officer in Branch 251 was also sentenced to 4 years and 6 months in prison on 24 February 2021 Eyad's duties included the transport of detainees to location where they would be tortured for days on end It was his knowledge of the fact that torture was happening there that landed him the sentence [129] [130]\n\n\nSectarianism\nThe successive governments of Hafez and Bashar al-Assad have been closely associated with the country's minority Alawite religious group [131] an offshoot of Shia, whereas the majority of the population, and most of the opposition, is Sunni This resulted in calls for persecution of the Alawites by parts of the opposition [131]\n\n\nKurdish autonomy in northeastern Syria\nThe Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES), also known as Rojava, [e] is a de facto autonomous region in northeastern Syria [139] [140] The region does not claim to pursue full independence but autonomy within a federal and democratic Syria [141] Rojava consists of self-governing sub-regions in the areas of Afrin, Jazira, Euphrates, Raqqa, Tabqa, Manbij and Deir Ez-Zor [142] [143] The region gained its de facto autonomy in 2012 in the context of the ongoing Rojava conflict, in which its official military force, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), has taken part [144] [145]\n\n\nHumanitarian impact\nAs of 2015 [update], 3.8 million have been made refugees [200] As of 2013 [update], one in three of Syrian refugees (about 667,000 people) sought safety in Lebanon (normally 4.8 million population) [201] Others have fled to Jordan, Turkey and Iraq Turkey has accepted 1.7 million (2015) Syrian refugees, half of whom are spread around cities and a dozen camps placed under the direct authority of the Turkish Government Satellite images confirmed that the first Syrian camps appeared in Turkey in July 2011, shortly after the towns of Deraa, Homs and Hama were besieged [202] In September 2014, the UN stated that the number of Syrian refugees had exceeded three million [203] According to the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, Sunnis are leaving for Lebanon and undermining Hezbollah's status The Syrian refugee crisis has caused the \"Jordan is Palestine\" threat to be diminished due to the onslaught of new refugees in Jordan Greek Catholic Patriarch Gregorios III Laham says more than 450,000 Syrian Christians have been displaced by the conflict [204] As of September 2016 [update], the European Union has reported that there are 13.5 million refugees in need of assistance in the country [205] Australia is being appealed to rescue more than 60 women and children stuck in Syria's Al-Hawl camp ahead of a potential Turkish invasion [206]\n\n\nRefugees\nAs of 2015 [update], 3.8 million have been made refugees [200] As of 2013 [update], one in three of Syrian refugees (about 667,000 people) sought safety in Lebanon (normally 4.8 million population) [201] Others have fled to Jordan, Turkey and Iraq Turkey has accepted 1.7 million (2015) Syrian refugees, half of whom are spread around cities and a dozen camps placed under the direct authority of the Turkish Government Satellite images

appealed to rescue more than 60 women and children stuck in Syria's Al-Hawl camp ahead of a potential Turkish invasion [206]\n\n\nReturn of refugees\nAnother aspect of the post-war years will be how to repatriate the millions of refugees The Syrian government has put forward a law commonly known as \"law 10\", which could strip refugees of property, such as damaged real estate There are also fears among some refugees that if they return to claim this property they will face negative consequences, such as forced conscription or prison The Syrian government has been criticized for using this law to reward those who have supported the government However, the government said this statement was false and has expressed that it wants the return of refugees from Lebanon [216] [217] In December 2018, it was also reported that the Syrian government has started to seize property under an anti-terrorism law, which is affecting government opponents negatively, with many losing their property Some people's pensions have also been cancelled [218]\n\n\nInternally displaced refugees\nThe violence in Syria caused millions to flee their homes As of March 2015, Al-Jazeera estimate 10.9 million Syrians, or almost half the population, have been displaced [200] Violence erupted due to the ongoing crisis in northwest Syria has forced 6,500 children to flee every day over the last week of January 2020 The recorded count of displaced children in the area has reached more than 300,000 since December 2019 [229]\n\n\nCasualties\nOn 2 January 2013, the United Nations stated that 60,000 had been killed since the civil war began, with UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay saying \"The number of casualties is much higher than we expected, and is truly shocking\" [233] Four months later, the UN's updated figure for the death toll had reached 80,000 [234] On 13 June 2013, the UN released an updated figure of people killed since fighting began, the figure being exactly 92,901, for up to the end of April 2013 Navi Pillay, UN high commissioner for human rights, stated that: \"This is most likely a minimum casualty figure\" The real toll was guessed to be over 100,000 [235] [236] Some areas of the country have been affected disproportionately by the war; by some estimates, as many as a third of all deaths have occurred in the city of Homs [237]\n\n\nHuman rights violations\nUnited Nations and human rights organizations have asserted that human rights violations have been committed by both the government and the rebel forces, with the \"vast majority of the abuses having been committed by the Syrian government\" [268] Numerous human rights abuses, political repression, war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Assad government throughout the course of the conflict has led to international condemnation and widespread calls to convict Bashar al-Assad in the International Criminal Court (ICC) [g] The unprecedented scale of the atrocities launched by government forces since the outbreak of the Syrian revolution has led to international outrage, and Syria's membership was suspended from various international organizations [274] [275]\n\n\nCrime wave\nAs the conflict has expanded across Syria, many cities have been engulfed in a wave of crime as fighting caused the disintegration of much of the civilian state, and many police stations stopped functioning Rates of theft increased, with criminals looting houses and stores Rates of kidnappings increased as well Rebel fighters were seen stealing cars and, in one instance, destroying a restaurant in Aleppo where Syrian soldiers had been seen eating [303]\n\n\nEpidemics\nThe World Health Organization has reported that 35% of the country's hospitals are out of service Fighting makes it impossible to undertake the normal vaccination programs The displaced refugees may also pose a disease risk to countries to which they have fled [307] Four hundred thousand civilians were isolated by the Siege of Eastern Ghouta from April 2013 to April 2018, resulting in acutely malnourished children according to the United Nations Special Advisor, Jan Egeland, who urged the parties for medical evacuations 55,000 civilians are also isolated in the Rukban refugee camp between Syria and Jordan, where humanitarian relief access is difficult due to the harsh desert conditions Humanitarian aid reaches the camp only sporadically, sometimes taking three months between shipments [308] [309]\n\n\nHumanitarian aid\nThe conflict holds the record for the largest sum ever requested by UN agencies for a single humanitarian emergency, $6.5 billion worth of requests of December 2013 [313] The international humanitarian response to the conflict in Syria is coordinated by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) in accordance with General Assembly Resolution 46/182 [314] The primary framework for this coordination is the Syria Humanitarian Assistance Response Plan (SHARP) which appealed for US$1.41 billion to meet the humanitarian needs of Syrians affected by the conflict [315] Official United Nations data on the humanitarian situation and response is available at an official website managed by UNOCHA Syria (Amman) [316] UNICEF is also working alongside these organizations to provide vaccinations and care packages to those in need Financial information on the response to the SHARP and assistance to refugees and for cross-border operations can be found on UNOCHA's Financial Tracking Service As of 19 September 2015, the top ten donors to Syria were United States, European Commission, United Kingdom, Kuwait, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Japan, UAE and Norway [317]\n\n\n2019 UN cross-border aid dispute\nAs of December 2019, a diplomatic dispute is occurring at the UN over re-authorization of cross-border aid for refugees China and Russia oppose the draft resolution that seeks to re-authorize crossing points in Turkey, Iraq and Jordan; China and Russia, as allies of Assad, seek to close the two crossing points in Iraq and Jordan, and to leave only the two crossing points in Turkey active [328] The current authorization expired on 10 January 2020 [329]\n\n\nCultural impact\nAs of March 2015 [update], the war has affected 290 heritage sites, severely damaged 104, and completely destroyed 24 [needs update] Five of the six UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Syria have been damaged [200] Destruction of antiquities has been caused by shelling, army entrenchment, and looting at various tells, museums and monuments [336] A group called Syrian Archaeological Heritage Under Threat is monitoring and recording the destruction in an attempt to create a list of heritage sites damaged during the war and to gain global support for the protection and preservation of Syrian archaeology and architecture [337]\n\n\nMedia coverage\nThe Syrian civil war is one of the most heavily documented wars in history, despite the extreme dangers that journalists face while in Syria [347]\n\n\nISIL executions\nOn 19 August 2014, American journalist James Foley was executed by ISIL, who said it was in retaliation for the United States operations in Iraq Foley was kidnapped in Syria in November 2012 by Shabiha militia [348] ISIL also threatened to execute Steven Sotloff, who was kidnapped at the Syrian–Turkish border in August 2013 [349] There were reports ISIS captured a Japanese national, two Italian nationals, and a Danish national as well [350] Sotloff was later executed in September 2014 At least 70 journalists have been killed covering the Syrian war, and more than 80 kidnapped, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists [351] On 22 August 2014, the al-Nusra Front released a video of captured Lebanese soldiers and demanded Hezbollah withdraw from Syria under threat of their execution [352]\n\n\nInternational reactions and diplomacy\nDuring the early period of the civil war, The Arab League, European Union, the United Nations, [353] and many Western governments quickly condemned the Syrian government's violent response to the protests, and expressed support for the protesters' right to exercise free speech [354] Initially, many Middle Eastern governments expressed support for Assad, but as the death toll mounted, they switched to a more balanced approach by criticizing violence from both government and protesters Both the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation suspended Syria's membership Russia and China vetoed Western-drafted United Nations Security Council resolutions in 2011 and 2012, which would have threatened the Syrian government with targeted sanctions if it continued military actions against protestors [355]\n\n\nEconomic sanctions\nThe U.S Congress has enacted punitive sanctions on the Syrian government for its actions during the Civil War These sanctions would penalize any entities lending support to the Syrian government, and any companies operating in Syria [356] [357] [358] [359] U.S President Donald Trump tried to protect the Turkish President Erdogan from the effects of such sanctions [360]\n\n\n2019 negotiations\nDuring the course of the war, there have been several international peace initiatives, undertaken by the Arab League, the United Nations and other actors [367] The Syrian government has refused efforts to negotiate with what it describes as armed terrorist groups [368] On 1 February 2016, the UN announced the formal start of the UN-mediated Geneva Syria peace talks [369] that had been agreed on by the International Syria Support Group (ISSG) in Vienna On 3 February 2016, the UN Syria peace mediator suspended the talks [370] On 14 March 2016, Geneva peace talks resumed The Syrian government stated that discussion of Bashar-al-Assad's presidency \"is a red line\", however Syria's President Bashar al-Assad said he hoped peace talks in Geneva would lead to concrete results, and stressed the need for a political process in Syria [371]\n\n\nBuffer zone with Turkey\nIn October 2019, in response to the Turkish offensive, Russia arranged for negotiations between the Syrian government in Damascus and the Kurdish-led forces [379] Russia also negotiated a renewal of a cease-fire between Kurds and Turkey that was about to expire [380]\n\n\nSyrian Constitutional Committee\nIn late 2019, a new Syrian Constitutional Committee began operating in order to discuss a new settlement and to draft a new constitution for Syria [392] [393] This committee comprises about 150 members It includes representatives of the Syrian government, opposition groups and countries serving as guarantors of the process, such as Russia However, this committee has faced strong opposition from the Assad government Fifty of the committee members represent the government, and 50 members represent the opposition [393] Until the Assad government agrees to participate, it is unclear whether the third round of talks will proceed on a firm schedule [393]\n\n\nArab League\nOn 13 April 2023, Syrian Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad arrived in Jeddah to meet Saudi foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan After frayed relations during the Syrian civil war, both nations now seek \"a political solution to the Syrian crisis that preserves the unity, security and stability of Syria\", according to the Saudi foreign ministry The high level talks are \"facilitating the return of Syrian refugees to their homeland, and securing humanitarian access to the affected areas in Syria\" Al-Assad previously visited the UAE, Oman as well as Saudi Arabia The discussion also included the possible resumption of consular services between the two countries This is the first visit to Saudi Arabia by a Syrian foreign minister since the onset of the civil war in 2011 The same week all foreign ministers of the Arab League would meet again to discuss the return of Syria to the regional organisation [398] [399]\n\n\nReconstruction\nUnited Nations authorities have estimated that the war in Syria has caused destruction reaching to about $400 billion [400] SNHR reported in 2017 that the war has rendered around 39% of Syrian mosques unserviceable for worship More than 13,500 mosques were destroyed in Syria between 2011 and 2017 Around 1,400 were dismantled by 2013, while 13,000 mosques got demolished between 2013 and 2017 [401] According to a Syrian war monitor, over 120 churches have been damaged or demolished by during the course of Syrian war since 2011; and 60% of these attacks were perpetrated by pro-Assad forces [402]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

agricultural sector over commercial retail, which \"will eventually benefit foreign brands.\" [124]\n\n\nWomen's rights\nIn state-led media, Raisi said that \"no one has the right to violate the freedom and rights of girls and women\" and \"it is incomplete to talk about culture and economy without the role of women\" He emphasized that \"women's rights are God-given, and the government

These reserves are used to settle international transactions and to maintain the stability of the country's financial system. The level of foreign exchange reserves is an important indicator of a country's economic health and its ability to withstand external economic shocks.\n\n**List**\n\nThe five countries with the largest foreign exchange reserves almost all have reserves of at least $500 billion USD and higher and have maintained such an amount for at least a week. At present, there are only six countries whose reserves are at such a figure: China, Japan, Switzerland, India, Russia, and Taiwan. Saudi Arabia was among the top five until March 2020, after which its reserves were severely depleted by the low oil price during the economic fallout of the global outbreak of coronavirus disease, its ongoing oil price war with Russia, and competition from U.S. shale oil.\n\nThe following table shows the top 10 countries by foreign exchange reserves as of the latest available data:\n\n| Rank | Country | Foreign Exchange Reserves (USD billion) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | China | 3,180.8 |\n| 2 | Japan | 1,264.1 |\n| 3 | Switzerland | 844.8 |\n| 4 | India | 583.3 |\n| 5 | Russia | 573.3 |\n| 6 | Taiwan | 544.5 |\n| 7 | South Korea | 444.8 |\n| 8 | Brazil | 374.8 |\n| 9 | Singapore | 364.8 |\n| 10 | Hong Kong | 357.8 |\n\n**Timeline of the Top 5 Countries**\n\nThe five countries with the largest foreign exchange reserves have consistently maintained their position over the years, with a few exceptions. Saudi Arabia was among the top five until March 2020, but its reserves have since declined due to various economic factors.\n\nHere is a brief timeline of the top 5 countries by foreign exchange reserves:\n\n* 2015: China, Japan, Switzerland, India, and Saudi Arabia were the top 5 countries by foreign exchange reserves.\n* 2016: China, Japan, Switzerland, India, and Saudi Arabia continued to hold the top 5 positions.\n* 2017: China, Japan, Switzerland, India, and Japan maintained their position, with Saudi Arabia's reserves declining slightly.\n* 2018: China, Japan, Switzerland, India, and Russia replaced Saudi Arabia in the top 5.\n* 2019: China, Japan, Switzerland, India, and Russia continued to hold the top 5 positions.\n* 2020: China, Japan, Switzerland, India, and Russia maintained their position, with Saudi Arabia's reserves declining significantly.\n\n**Currency Composition of Foreign Exchange Reserves**\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) releases quarterly data on the currency composition of official foreign exchange reserves. The data are reported to the IMF on a voluntary and confidential basis. As of Q4 2016, there were 146 reporters, consisting of IMF member countries, a number of non-member countries/economies, and other entities holding foreign exchange reserves.\n\nThe currency composition of foreign exchange reserves is an important indicator of a country's economic relationships and its exposure to currency risks. The following table shows the top 5 currencies held by foreign exchange reserves as of Q4 2016:\n\n| Rank | Currency | Percentage of Total Reserves |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | US Dollar | 62.1% |\n| 2 | Euro | 20.5% |\n| 3 | Japanese Yen | 5.8% |\n| 4 | Chinese Renminbi | 3.9% |\n| 5 | British Pound | 3.2% |\n\n**Monetary Gold**\n\nMonetary gold is not covered in COFER but included in reserved assets, a broader scope than that of COFER.

Her name is derived from her time and date of birth (7 a.m on 7 July), as \"eve\" is the middle of the word \"seven\". Her godfather is musician Gavin Friday.\n\nGrowing up in an affluent suburb of Dublin, Killiney, Hewson was exposed to the world of music from a young age. Her father's career with U2 meant that she was often on tour and in the public eye. Despite this, Hewson's parents were against her pursuing a career in the entertainment industry.\n\nCareer\n-------\n\nAlthough Hewson's parents were against her performing, she made her acting debut in 2005 alongside her sister Jordan in the short film Lost and Found. She made her feature-length debut in 2008 in The 27 Club. The same year, Hewson took part in the acting program at the New York Film Academy.\n\nIn 2010, Hewson appeared in the music video and accompanying short film for Irish band The Script's song \"For the First Time\".

She later lived in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where she attended New York University. Hewson graduated from NYU on May 22, 2013. Her father, Bono, declined an offer of an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from NYU on the same day, stating he wishes to focus on \"being a proud father\".\n\nHewson's personal life is often kept out of the public eye. However, in a 2013 interview with The Irish Times, she spoke about the challenges of growing up as the daughter of a famous musician. She stated that she had \"always been aware of the fact that my dad is a rock star, but I've never really let it affect me\".\n\nHewson is a private individual and keeps her relationships and personal life out of the spotlight. However, she has been linked to several high-profile individuals in the past.\n\nFilmography\n------------\n\n### Film\n\n* Lost and Found (2005) - Hewson made her acting debut in this short film alongside her sister Jordan.\n* The 27 Club (2008) - Hewson made her feature-length debut in this film.\n* Enough Said (2013) - Hewson played the role of Becca in this romantic comedy-drama.\n* This Must Be the Place (2011) - Hewson played the role of Toni in this drama film.\n* Song One (2014) - Hewson played the role of Franny in this romantic drama film.\n* Bridge of Spies (2015) - Hewson played the role of Mary McKenna in this historical drama film.\n* The Greatest Showman (2017) - Hewson played the role of Anne Wheeler in this biographical musical drama film.\n* Robin Hood (2018) - Hewson played the role of Maid Marian in this action-adventure film.\n\n### Television\n\n* This Must Be the Place (2011) - Hewson played the role of Toni in this TV series.\n* The 27 Club (2008) - Hewson played the lead role in this TV series.\n* Blue Book (2019) - Hewson played the lead role in this TV series.\n\n### Music Videos\n\n* The Script - \"For the First Time\" (2010) - Hewson appeared in the music video and accompanying short film for this song.\n* The Script - \"Breakeven\" (2010) - Hewson appeared in the music video for this song.\n\nAwards\n------\n\n* Irish Film and Television Awards (2013) - Hewson was nominated for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her performance in Enough Said.\n* Empire Awards (2014) - Hewson was nominated for Best Newcomer for her performance in Enough Said.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal Links\n--------------\n\n* Eve Hewson on IMDb\n* Eve Hewson on Twitter\n* Eve Hewson on Instagram", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Eve_Hewson\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nHewson was born in Dublin, Ireland, the second daughter of activist Ali Hewson (née Alison Stewart) and U2 lead singer Bono (Paul David Hewson) Her name is derived from her time and date of birth (7 a.m on 7 July), as \"eve\" is the middle of the word \"seven\" [2] Her godfather is musician Gavin Friday [3]\n\n\nCareer\nAlthough Hewson's parents were against her performing, [8] she made her acting debut in 2005 alongside her sister Jordan in the short film Lost and Found She made her feature-length debut in 2008 in The 27 Club [9] The same year, Hewson took part in the acting programme at the New York Film Academy In 2010, she appeared in the music video and accompanying short film for Irish band The Script's song \"For the First Time\" [10]\n\n\nPersonal life\nHewson grew up in Killiney, an affluent suburb of Dublin; [21] she later lived in Williamsburg, Brooklyn [22] [23] She graduated from New York University on 22 May 2013; her father, Bono, declined an offer of an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from NYU on the same day, stating he wishes to focus on \"being a proud father\" [24]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nMusic videos\n\n\nAwards\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Stede Bonnet likeable, telling SlashFilm that he was \"the only person who could play it\" [20] Darby, whose career has consisted primarily of supporting comedic roles, saw the role as an opportunity

{"title": "Great_Replacement", "content": "\nBackground\nRenaud Camus developed his conspiracy theory in two books published in 2010 and 2011, in the context of an increase in anti-immigrant rhetoric in public discourse during the previous decade [25] Europe also experienced an escalation in Islamic terrorist attacks during the 2000s–2010s, [26] and a migrant crisis in the years 2015–2016, [27] which exacerbated tensions and prepared public opinion for the reception of Camus's conspiracy theory [28] [8] As the latter depicts a population replacement said to occur in a short time lapse of one or two generations, the migrant crisis was particularly conducive to the spread of Camus's ideas while the terrorist attacks accelerated the construction of immigrants as an existential threat among those who shared such a worldview [8]\n\n\nConcept of Renaud Camus\nThe \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy theory was developed by French author Renaud Camus, initially in a 2010 book titled L'Abécédaire de l'in-nocence (\"Abecedarium of no-harm\"), [c] [32] and the following year in an eponymous book, Le Grand Remplacement (introduction au remplacisme global) [d] Camus has claimed that the name Grand Remplacement \"came to  [him], almost by chance, perhaps in a more or less unconscious reference to the Grand Dérangement of the Acadians in the 18th century.\" [33] As an epigraph to the later book, Camus chose Bertolt Brecht's quip from the satirical poem Die Lösung that the easiest thing to do for a government which had lost the confidence of its people would be to choose new people [34]\n\n\nClaimed influences\nCamus cites two influential figures in the epilogue of his 2011 book The Great Replacement: British politician Enoch Powell's apocalyptic vision of future race relations—expressed in his 1968 \"Rivers of Blood\" speech—and French author Jean Raspail's depiction of the collapse of the West from an overwhelming \"tidal wave\" of Third World immigration, featured in his 1973 novel The Camp of the Saints [16] [43]\n\n\nSimilar themes\nDespite its own singularities and concepts, the \"Great Replacement\" is encompassed in a larger and older \"white genocide\" conspiracy theory, [46] popularized in the US by neo-Nazi David Lane in his 1995 White Genocide Manifesto, where he asserted that governments in Western countries were intending to turn white people into \"extinct species\" [47] [48] Scholars generally agree that, although he did not father the theme, Camus indeed coined the term \"Great Replacement\" as a slogan and concept, and eventually led it to its fame in the 2010s [49] [50]\n\n\nAnalysis\nWhile the ethnic demography of France has shifted as a result of post-WWII immigration, scholars have generally dismissed the claims of a \"great replacement\" as being rooted in an exaggeration of immigration statistics and unscientific, racially prejudiced views [12] Geographer Landis MacKellar criticized Camus's thesis for assuming \"that third- and fourth- generation 'immigrants' are somehow not French.\" [63] Researchers have variously estimated the Muslim population of France at between 8.8% and 12.5% in 2017, and less than 1% in 2001, [64] [65] making a \"replacement\" unlikely according to MacKellar [63]\n\n\nDemographic statistics\nWhile the ethnic demography of France has shifted as a result of post-WWII immigration, scholars have generally dismissed the claims of a \"great replacement\" as being rooted in an exaggeration of immigration statistics and unscientific, racially prejudiced views [12] Geographer Landis MacKellar criticized Camus's thesis for assuming \"that third- and fourth- generation 'immigrants' are somehow not French.\" [63] Researchers have variously estimated the Muslim population of France at between 8.8% and 12.5% in 2017, and less than 1% in 2001, [64] [65] making a \"replacement\" unlikely according to MacKellar [63]\n\n\nRacial connotations\nIn the words of scholar Andrew Fergus Wilson, whereas the islamophobic Great Replacement theory can be distinguished from the parallel antisemitic white genocide conspiracy theory, \"they share the same terms of reference and both are ideologically aligned with the so-called '14 words' of David Lane  [\"We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children\"].\" [17] In 2021, the Anti-Defamation League wrote that \"since many white supremacists, particularly those in the United States, blame Jews for non-white immigration to the U.S.\", the Great Replacement theory has been increasingly associated with antisemitism and conflated with the white genocide conspiracy theory [20] [66] Scholar Kathleen Belew has argued that the Great Replacement theory \"allows an opportunism in selecting enemies\", but \"also follows the central motivating logic, which is to protect the thing on the inside  [i.e the preservation and birth rate of the white race], regardless of the enemy on the outside.\" [67]\n\n\nPopularity\nThe simplicity and use of catch-all slogans in Camus's formulations—\"you have one people, and in the space of a generation you have a different people\" [18]—as well as his removal of antisemitism from the original neo-Nazi \"white genocide\" conspiracy theory, have been cited as conducive to the popularity of the \"Great Replacement\" in Europe [19] [16]\n\n\nPolitical influence\nMuch of the European spread of the Great Replacement (French: Grand Remplacement) conspiracy theory rhetoric is due to its prevalence in French national discourse and media Nationalist right-wing groups in France have asserted that there is an ongoing \"Islamo-substitution\" of the indigenous French population, associating the presence of Muslims in France with potential danger and destruction of French culture and civilization [82] [9] [83]\n\n\nEurope\nMuch of the European spread of the Great Replacement (French: Grand Remplacement) conspiracy theory

[83]\n\n\nAustria\nIdentitäre Bewegung Österreich (IBÖ), the Austrian branch of the Identitarian movement, promotes this theory, citing a \"great exchange\" [j] or replacement of the population that supposedly needs to be reversed [100] In April 2019, Heinz-Christian Strache campaigning for his FPÖ party ahead of the 2019 European Parliament election endorsed the conspiracy theory [101] Claiming that \"population replacement\" in Austria was a real threat, he stated that \"We don't want to become a minority in our own country\" [102] Compatriot Martin Sellner, who also supports the theory, celebrated Strache's political use of the Great Replacement [103] [104]\n\n\nBelgium\nIn September 2018, Schild & Vrienden  [nl], an extremist Flemish youth organization, were reported to be endorsing the conspiracy theory The group, claiming that native populations of Europe were being replaced by migrants; they proposed an end to all immigration, forced deportation of non-whites, and the founding of ethnostates [105] The following month, VRT detailed how the organization was discussing the Great Replacement on secretive chat channels, and using the conspiracy theory to promote Flemish ethnic identity [106]\n\n\nDenmark\nUse of the Great Replacement (Danish: Store Udskiftning) conspiracy theory has become common in right-wing Danish political rhetoric In April 2019, Rasmus Paludan, leader of the Hard Line party, which is widely associated with the Great Replacement, [109] claimed that by the year 2040 ethnic Danish people would be approaching to be a minority in Denmark, having been outnumbered by Muslims and their descendants [110] During a debate for the 2019 European Parliament elections, Paludan used the concept to justify a proposal to ban Muslim immigration and deport all Islamic residents from the country, in what Le Monde described as Paludan \"preaching the 'great replacement theory'\" [111]\n\n\nFinland\nFar-right Finns Party representatives and ministers have used the word \"great replacement\" (Finnish: Väestönvaihto) in their writings [112] Finns Party Speaker of the Parliament Jussi Halla-Aho and the party leader Riikka Purra have also promoted the theory Halla-aho stated that it is ”dishonest to say that the great replacement is not going on, that it would not be rapid, and that it would not continue just as long as it is allowed to continue.” [113] Riikka Purra wrote ”In any case, I use the term great replacement myself, because that is what this is, as long as this is being actively perpetrated”, Purra wrote \"As long as immigration policy is active and promotes immigration, the Finnish population will be exchanged for another\" [114]  In October 2023 four men were convicted of offences committed with terrorist intent According to the prosecutor, the defendants were motivated by the idea of a conspiracy of the government and Jewish people to replace the native population Police said the potential targets of the attack were political decision-makers [115]\n\n\nGermany\nEx-SPD politician Thilo Sarrazin is reported to be one of the most influential promoters of the Great Replacement, having published several books on the subject, some of which, such as Germany Abolishes Itself, are in high circulation [109] Sarrazin has proposed that there are too many immigrants in Germany, and that they supposedly have lower IQs than Germans Regarding the demographics of Germany, he has claimed  that in a century ethnic Germans will drop in number to 25 million, in 200 years to eight million and in 300 years: three million [109]\n\n\nHungary\nPrime Minister Viktor Orbán and his political party Fidesz in Hungary have been associated with the conspiracy theory over the course of several years [118] [119] The Sydney Morning Herald detailed Orbán's belief in and promotion of the Great Replacement as being central to the modern right-wing politics of Europe In December 2018, he claimed the \"Christian identity of Europe\" needed saving, and labelled refugees traveling to Europe as \"Muslim invaders\" [93] In a speech, Orbán asserted: \"If in the future Europe is to be populated by people other than Europeans, and we accept this as a fact and see it as natural, then we will effectively be consenting to population replacement: to a process in which the European population is replaced\" [120]\n\n\nIreland\nA 2019 Lidl advertisement that featured a white Irish woman, her Afro-Brazilian partner and their mixed race son was targeted by former journalist Gemma O'Doherty as part of an attempt at a \"Great Replacement\" After facing online harassment the family decided to leave Ireland [123] [124] [125] The \"Great Replacement\" has also been used in Ireland in opposition to direct provision centres, used to house asylum seekers [126]\n\n\nItaly\nThe current Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has endorsed the Great Replacement ideology [134] Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini of Italy (2018–2019) has repeatedly adopted the theme of the Great Replacement [118] In May 2016, two years before his election to office, he claimed \"ethnic replacement is underway\" in Italy in an interview with Sky TG24 Accusing nameless, well-funded organizations for importing workers that he named \"farm slaves\", he stated that there was a \"lucrative attempt at genocide\" of Italians [135] [136]\n\n\nNetherlands\nIn April 2015, writing on the publishing website GeenStijl, scholar of Islam Hans Jansen used Great Replacement rhetoric, suggesting that it was an \"undisputed\" fact that among the European Union's governing elite there was a common consensus that Europeans were \"no good and can be better replaced\" [138] In May 2015, Martin Bosma, a Dutch parliament Representative for the Party for Freedom (PVV), released his book Minority in their own land  [nl] Invoking the conspiracy theory, Bosma wrote about a growing 'a new population' of immigrants which lent itself to an apparently 'post-racial Multicultural State of Salvation' [138]\n\n\nSpain\nThe far-right party Vox has been described as circulating the theory for its discourse about low natality rates in Spaniards compared to migrants [143] According to journalist Antonio Maestre of El Diario, such an ideology is shared between Vox and some extreme strains of Catalan nationalism who fear replacement by Spanish-speakers [144]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nAccording to November 2018 research from the University of Cambridge, 31% of Brexit voters believe in the conspiracy theory compared to 6% of British people who oppose Brexit [145]\n\n\nTurkey\nLeader of the Victory Party Ümit Özdağ uses a Turkish version of the theory He previously argued that Turkey will be a \"Migrantland\" (Göçmenistan) unless Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu wins the 2023 Turkish presidential election [149]\n\n\nNorth America\nYouTuber Lauren Southern of Canada has helped amplify the conspiracy theory [93] [150] In 2017, Southern dedicated a video to the Great Replacement, gaining over half a million views on her channel, before it was deleted [18] [151] [152] 2018 mayoral candidate for Toronto Faith Goldy has publicly embraced the replacement theory [153] [154] In 2019, in the aftermath of the Christchurch mosque shootings in Christchurch, New Zealand, Vice accused Goldy of routinely pushing the same ideas of birthrate declines and the population replacement of whites, found in the gunman's The Great Replacement manifesto [155] When white nationalist Paul Fromm co-opted the pre-1967 Canadian national flag, the Canadian Red Ensign, he referred to it as \"the flag of the true Canada, the European Canada before the treasonous European replacement schemes brought in by the 1965 immigration policies\"

version of a white nationalist far-right conspiracy theory that racial minorities are displacing the traditional white American population and taking control of the nation Versions of the theory \"have become commonplace\" in the Republican Party of the United States, and have become a major issue of political debate  It also has stimulated violent responses including mass murders [164] It resembles the Great Replacement theory promoted in Europe, [165] but has its origins in American nativism around 1900 According to Erika Lee, in 1894 the old stock Yankee upper-class founders of the Immigration Restriction League were, \"convinced that Anglo-Saxon traditions, peoples, and culture were being drowned in a flood of racially inferior foreigners from Southern and Eastern Europe.\"

immigrants [19] [32] \"We shall not leave Europe, we shall make Africa leave Europe,\" Camus wrote in 2019 to define his political agenda for the European parliament elections [41] He has also used

an", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Great_Replacement\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nRenaud Camus developed his conspiracy theory in two books published in 2010 and 2011, in the context of an increase in anti-immigrant rhetoric in public discourse during the previous decade [25] Europe also experienced an escalation in Islamic terrorist attacks during the 2000s–2010s, [26] and a migrant crisis in the years 2015–2016, [27] which exacerbated tensions and prepared public opinion for the reception of Camus's conspiracy theory [28] [8] As the latter depicts a population replacement said to occur in a short time lapse of one or two generations, the migrant crisis was particularly conducive to the spread of Camus's ideas while the terrorist attacks accelerated the construction of immigrants as an existential threat among those who shared such a worldview [8]\n\n\nConcept of Renaud Camus\nThe \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy theory was developed by French author Renaud Camus, initially in a 2010 book titled L'Abécédaire de l'in-nocence (\"Abecedarium of no-harm\"), [c] [32] and the following year in an eponymous book, Le Grand Remplacement (introduction au remplacisme global) [d] Camus has claimed that the name Grand Remplacement \"came to  [him], almost by chance, perhaps in a more or less unconscious reference to the Grand Dérangement of the Acadians in the 18th century.\" [33] As an epigraph to the later book, Camus chose Bertolt Brecht's quip from the satirical poem Die Lösung that the easiest thing to do for a government which had lost the confidence of its people would be to choose new people [34]\n\n\nClaimed influences\nCamus cites two influential figures in the epilogue of his 2011 book The Great Replacement: British politician Enoch Powell's apocalyptic vision of future race relations—expressed in his 1968 \"Rivers of Blood\" speech—and French author Jean Raspail's depiction of the collapse of the West from an overwhelming \"tidal wave\" of Third World immigration, featured in his 1973 novel The Camp of the Saints [16] [43]\n\n\nSimilar themes\nDespite its own singularities and concepts, the \"Great Replacement\" is encompassed in a larger and older \"white genocide\" conspiracy theory, [46] popularized in the US by neo-Nazi David Lane in his 1995 White Genocide Manifesto, where he asserted that governments in Western countries were intending to turn white people into \"extinct species\" [47] [48] Scholars generally agree that, although he did not father the theme, Camus indeed coined the term \"Great Replacement\" as a slogan and concept, and eventually led it to its fame in the 2010s [49] [50]\n\n\nAnalysis\nWhile the ethnic demography of France has shifted as a result of post-WWII immigration, scholars have generally dismissed the claims of a \"great replacement\" as being rooted in an exaggeration of immigration statistics and unscientific, racially prejudiced views [12] Geographer Landis MacKellar criticized Camus's thesis for assuming \"that third- and fourth- generation 'immigrants' are somehow not French.\" [63] Researchers have variously estimated the Muslim population of France at between 8.8% and 12.5% in 2017, and less than 1% in 2001, [64] [65] making a \"replacement\" unlikely according to MacKellar [63]\n\n\nDemographic statistics\nWhile the ethnic demography of France has shifted as a result of post-WWII immigration, scholars have generally dismissed the claims of a \"great replacement\" as being rooted in an exaggeration of immigration statistics and unscientific, racially prejudiced views [12] Geographer Landis MacKellar criticized Camus's thesis for assuming \"that third- and fourth- generation 'immigrants' are somehow not French.\" [63] Researchers have variously estimated the Muslim population of France at between 8.8% and 12.5% in 2017, and less than 1% in 2001, [64] [65] making a \"replacement\" unlikely according to MacKellar [63]\n\n\nRacial connotations\nIn the words of scholar Andrew Fergus Wilson, whereas the islamophobic Great Replacement theory can be distinguished from the parallel antisemitic white genocide conspiracy theory, \"they share the same terms of reference and both are ideologically aligned with the so-called '14 words' of David Lane  [\"We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children\"].\" [17] In 2021, the Anti-Defamation League wrote that \"since many white supremacists, particularly those in the United States, blame Jews for non-white immigration to the U.S.\", the Great Replacement theory has been increasingly associated with antisemitism and conflated with the white genocide conspiracy theory [20] [66] Scholar Kathleen Belew has argued that the Great Replacement theory \"allows an opportunism in selecting enemies\", but \"also follows the central motivating logic, which is to protect the thing on the inside  [i.e the preservation and birth rate of the white race], regardless of the enemy on the outside.\" [67]\n\n\nPopularity\nThe simplicity and use of catch-all slogans in Camus's formulations—\"you have one people, and in the space of a generation you have a different people\" [18]—as well as his removal of antisemitism from the original neo-Nazi \"white genocide\" conspiracy theory, have been cited as conducive to the popularity of the \"Great Replacement\" in Europe [19] [16]\n\n\nPolitical influence\nMuch of the European spread of the Great Replacement (French: Grand Remplacement) conspiracy theory rhetoric is due to its prevalence in French national discourse and media Nationalist right-wing groups in France have asserted that there is an ongoing \"Islamo-substitution\" of the indigenous French population, associating the presence of Muslims in France with potential danger and destruction of French culture and civilization [82] [9] [83]\n\n\nEurope\nMuch of the European spread of the Great Replacement

danger and destruction of French culture and civilization [82] [9] [83]\n\n\nAustria\nIdentitäre Bewegung Österreich (IBÖ), the Austrian branch of the Identitarian movement, promotes this theory, citing a \"great exchange\" [j] or replacement of the population that supposedly needs to be reversed [100] In April 2019, Heinz-Christian Strache campaigning for his FPÖ party ahead of the 2019 European Parliament election endorsed the conspiracy theory [101] Claiming that \"population replacement\" in Austria was a real threat, he stated that \"We don't want to become a minority in our own country\" [102] Compatriot Martin Sellner, who also supports the theory, celebrated Strache's political use of the Great Replacement [103] [104]\n\n\nBelgium\nIn September 2018, Schild & Vrienden  [nl], an extremist Flemish youth organization, were reported to be endorsing the conspiracy theory The group, claiming that native populations of Europe were being replaced by migrants; they proposed an end to all immigration, forced deportation of non-whites, and the founding of ethnostates [105] The following month, VRT detailed how the organization was discussing the Great Replacement on secretive chat channels, and using the conspiracy theory to promote Flemish ethnic identity [106]\n\n\nDenmark\nUse of the Great Replacement (Danish: Store Udskiftning) conspiracy theory has become common in right-wing Danish political rhetoric In April 2019, Rasmus Paludan, leader of the Hard Line party, which is widely associated with the Great Replacement, [109] claimed that by the year 2040 ethnic Danish people would be approaching to be a minority in Denmark, having been outnumbered by Muslims and their descendants [110] During a debate for the 2019 European Parliament elections, Paludan used the concept to justify a proposal to ban Muslim immigration and deport all Islamic residents from the country, in what Le Monde described as Paludan \"preaching the 'great replacement theory'\" [111]\n\n\nFinland\nFar-right Finns Party representatives and ministers have used the word \"great replacement\" (Finnish: Väestönvaihto) in their writings [112] Finns Party Speaker of the Parliament Jussi Halla-Aho and the party leader Riikka Purra have also promoted the theory Halla-aho stated that it is ”dishonest to say that the great replacement is not going on, that it would not be rapid, and that it would not continue just as long as it is allowed to continue.” [113] Riikka Purra wrote ”In any case, I use the term great replacement myself, because that is what this is, as long as this is being actively perpetrated”, Purra wrote \"As long as immigration policy is active and promotes immigration, the Finnish population will be exchanged for another\" [114]  In October 2023 four men were convicted of offences committed with terrorist intent According to the prosecutor, the defendants were motivated by the idea of a conspiracy of the government and Jewish people to replace the native population Police said the potential targets of the attack were political decision-makers [115]\n\n\nGermany\nEx-SPD politician Thilo Sarrazin is reported to be one of the most influential promoters of the Great Replacement, having published several books on the subject, some of which, such as Germany Abolishes Itself, are in high circulation [109] Sarrazin has proposed that there are too many immigrants in Germany, and that they supposedly have lower IQs than Germans Regarding the demographics of Germany, he has claimed  that in a century ethnic Germans will drop in number to 25 million, in 200 years to eight million and in 300 years: three million [109]\n\n\nHungary\nPrime Minister Viktor Orbán and his political party Fidesz in Hungary have been associated with the conspiracy theory over the course of several years [118] [119] The Sydney Morning Herald detailed Orbán's belief in and promotion of the Great Replacement as being central to the modern right-wing politics of Europe In December 2018, he claimed the \"Christian identity of Europe\" needed saving, and labelled refugees traveling to Europe as \"Muslim invaders\" [93] In a speech, Orbán asserted: \"If in the future Europe is to be populated by people other than Europeans, and we accept this as a fact and see it as natural, then we will effectively be consenting to population replacement: to a process in which the European population is replaced\" [120]\n\n\nIreland\nA 2019 Lidl advertisement that featured a white Irish woman, her Afro-Brazilian partner and their mixed race son was targeted by former journalist Gemma O'Doherty as part of an attempt at a \"Great Replacement\" After facing online harassment the family decided to leave Ireland [123] [124] [125] The \"Great Replacement\" has also been used in Ireland in opposition to direct provision centres, used to house asylum seekers [126]\n\n\nItaly\nThe current Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has endorsed the Great Replacement ideology [134] Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini of Italy (2018–2019) has repeatedly adopted the theme of the Great Replacement [118] In May 2016, two years before his election to office, he claimed \"ethnic replacement is underway\" in Italy in an interview with Sky TG24 Accusing nameless, well-funded organizations for importing workers that he named \"farm slaves\", he stated that there was a \"lucrative attempt at genocide\" of Italians [135] [136]\n\n\nNetherlands\nIn April 2015, writing on the publishing website GeenStijl, scholar of Islam Hans Jansen used Great Replacement rhetoric, suggesting that it was an \"undisputed\" fact that among the European Union's governing elite there was a common consensus that Europeans were \"no good and can be better replaced\" [138] In May 2015, Martin Bosma, a Dutch parliament Representative for the Party for Freedom (PVV), released his book Minority in their own land  [nl] Invoking the conspiracy theory, Bosma wrote about a growing 'a new population' of immigrants which lent itself to an apparently 'post-racial Multicultural State of Salvation' [138]\n\n\nSpain\nThe far-right party Vox has been described as circulating the theory for its discourse about low natality rates in Spaniards compared to migrants [143] According to journalist Antonio Maestre of El Diario, such an ideology is shared between Vox and some extreme strains of Catalan nationalism who fear replacement by Spanish-speakers [144]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nAccording to November 2018 research from the University of Cambridge, 31% of Brexit voters believe in the conspiracy theory compared to 6% of British people who oppose Brexit [145]\n\n\nTurkey\nLeader of the Victory Party Ümit Özdağ uses a Turkish version of the theory He previously argued that Turkey will be a \"Migrantland\" (Göçmenistan) unless Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu wins the 2023 Turkish presidential election [149]\n\n\nNorth America\nYouTuber Lauren Southern of Canada has helped amplify the conspiracy theory [93] [150] In 2017, Southern dedicated a video to the Great Replacement, gaining over half a million views on her channel, before it was deleted [18] [151] [152] 2018 mayoral candidate for Toronto Faith Goldy has publicly embraced the replacement theory [153] [154] In 2019, in the aftermath of the Christchurch mosque shootings in Christchurch, New Zealand, Vice accused Goldy of routinely pushing the same ideas of birthrate declines and the population replacement of whites, found in the gunman's The Great Replacement manifesto [155] When white nationalist Paul Fromm co-opted the pre-1967 Canadian national flag, the Canadian Red Ensign, he referred to it as \"the flag of the true Canada, the European Canada before the treasonous European replacement schemes brought in by the 1965 immigration policies\" [156]\n\n\nCanada\nYouTuber Lauren Southern of Canada has helped amplify the conspiracy theory [93] [150] In 2017, Southern dedicated a video to

Great replacement in the United States is the American version of a white nationalist far-right conspiracy theory that racial minorities are displacing the traditional white American population and taking control of the nation Versions of the theory \"have become commonplace\" in the Republican Party of the United States, and have become a major issue of political debate  It also has stimulated violent responses including mass murders [164] It resembles the Great Replacement theory promoted in Europe, [165] but has its origins in American nativism around 1900 According to Erika Lee, in 1894 the old stock Yankee upper-class founders of the Immigration Restriction League were, \"convinced that Anglo-Saxon traditions, peoples, and culture were being drowned in a flood of racially inferior foreigners from Southern and Eastern Europe.\" [166]\n\n\nOceania\nThe media in Australia have covered former Senator Fraser Anning of Queensland and his endorsement of the Great Replacement conspiracy theory [167] In April 2019, Reuters reported how Anning was amplifying replacement theory by suggesting that Muslims would \"out-breed us very quickly\" [168] In May 2019, Anning alleged that white Australians would \"fast become a minority\" if they did not defend their \"ethno-cultural identity\" [169]\n\n\nAustralia\nThe media in Australia have covered former Senator Fraser Anning

Zealand\nThe far right neo-Nazi youth group Action Zealandia has endorsed the Great Replacement theory, alleging that European identity in New Zealand is being threatened by economically driven non-white migration [170] In addition, the group has promoted the pseudohistorical notion that white people settled in New Zealand before the arrival of the indigenous Māori people [171] According to the journalist Marc Daalder, Action Zealandia is the successor to the Dominion Movement, a far right group that ceased its activities following the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings

{"title": "2022_Commonwealth_Games", "content": "\nHost selection\nTwo cities initially launched bids for the games: Durban, South Africa, and Edmonton, Canada Edmonton withdrew its bid in February 2015, leaving Durban as the only bid to go forward to CGF General Assembly in September 2015 [12] Durban initially secured the right to host the games, as they were the sole bidder for the event The city previously considered bidding for the 2020 or 2024 Summer Olympics, but later dropped the idea as it wanted to focus on the 2022 Commonwealth Games [13] It would have marked the first time the games were held in Africa and the second time a Commonwealth republic would have hosted, following Delhi, India, in 2010 The games were set to open on 18 July 2022, coinciding with the birthday of the late South African president, Nelson Mandela [14] It was reported in February 2017 that Durban might be unable to host the games due to financial constraints [15] This was confirmed one month later on 13 March 2017 when the CGF stripped Durban of their rights to host the Games [16]\n\n\nDevelopment and preparation\nThe Birmingham Organising Committee for the 2022 Commonwealth Games (BOCCG) was responsible for the planning and operational delivery of the Games [29] This includes sport, venue and competition management, ticket sales, all ceremonies and the Queen's Baton Relay The headquarters of the organising committee is located in One Brindleyplace building and has taken up the office until December 2022 [30]\n\n\nVenues\nThe 2022 Commonwealth Games took place in 15 venues spread across the West Midlands region, with seven of them, including the athletics stadium and marathon route, located in the city of Birmingham The National Exhibition Centre complex, located on the fringes of the city in neighbouring Solihull, hosted events in its exhibition halls and at the Resorts World Arena The six other regional hosts were Coventry, Cannock Chase, Royal Leamington Spa, Sandwell, Warwick and Wolverhampton A sixteenth venue, the Lee Valley VeloPark in Stratford, East London, hosted the track cycling [40]\n\n\nAthletes' village\nPerry Bar was selected to be the site of the athlete's village, with plans made to demolish the former Birmingham City University campus after the university had moved to a new campus [41] [42] The new village was supposed to house up to 6,500 athletes and officials during the games and then become 1,400 new homes after the games, as part of a wider regeneration effort [43] Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, construction of the village fell

Games, were an international multi-sport event held in Birmingham, England, from July 28 to August 8, 2022. The games were the 22nd edition of the Commonwealth Games, a quadrennial event that brings together athletes from the Commonwealth of Nations.\n\n**Host selection**\n\nThe host city was initially chosen to be Durban, South Africa, but in 2017, the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) stripped Durban of its rights to host the Games due to financial constraints. This left Edmonton, Canada, as the only other bidder, but it also withdrew its bid in 2015. As a result, Birmingham, England, was awarded the hosting rights in 2017.\n\n**Development and preparation**\n\nThe Birmingham Organising Committee for the 2022 Commonwealth Games (BOCCG) was responsible for the planning and operational delivery of the Games. This included sport, venue, and competition management, ticket sales, all ceremonies, and the Queen's Baton Relay. The headquarters of the organising committee was located in One Brindleyplace building and had taken up the office until December 2022.\n\n**Venues**\n\nThe 2022 Commonwealth Games took place in 15 venues spread across the West Midlands region, with seven of them, including the athletics stadium and marathon route, located in the city of Birmingham. The National Exhibition Centre complex, located on the fringes of the city in neighbouring Solihull, hosted events in its exhibition halls and at the Resorts World Arena. The six other regional hosts were Coventry, Cannock Chase, Royal Leamington Spa, Sandwell, Warwick, and Wolverhampton. A sixteenth venue, the Lee Valley VeloPark in Stratford, East London, hosted the track cycling events.\n\n**Athletes' village**\n\nPerry Bar was selected to be the site of the athlete's village, with plans made to demolish the former Birmingham City University campus after the university had moved to a new campus. The new village was supposed to house up to 6,500 athletes and officials during the games and then become 1,400 new homes after the games, as part of a wider regeneration effort. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, construction of the village fell significantly behind schedule, and the games' dates were not pushed back to accommodate this. As a result, the athletes and team officials were housed in three 'campus' villages close to competition venues at the University of Birmingham, the University of Warwick, and the NEC.\n\n**Transport**\n\nThe A34 flyover in Perry Barr was demolished in favour of a dual carriageway at ground level, cycle path, and improved public transport services, which were approved by Birmingham City Council in October 2019 under its £27.1 million scheme.\n\n**Cost and financing**\n\nAt the time of submission of the bid to the CGF, the bid committee announced that the event would cost £750 million.

Returning to the Games for the first time in 24 years, due to various calendar issues, cricket will be exclusively female for the first time.\n\n\nAssociated competitions\nIn January 2020, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), which functions also as the Commonwealth Games Association (CGA) representing India, submitted a proposal to the CGF to host a combined archery and shooting championships in Chandigarh during January 2022 The proposal was endorsed by the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI), the Government of India, the ISSF and WA [164] [165] [166] The CGF Executive Board approved the proposal at their meeting in London which took place on 21–23 February 2020, and also confirmed that the 2022 Commonwealth Shooting and Archery Championships and the 2022 Commonwealth Games will be two separately organised and funded Commonwealth Sport events The CGF shall issue a medal table one week following the Birmingham 2022 closing ceremony that includes results from Chandigarh 2022 as a further and final ranking of competing nations and territories from the respective competitions [167] [168] [169] In July 2021, the CGF announced that the event had been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in India [170]\n\n\nCalendar\nThe schedule was as follows: [173]\n\n\nMedal table\nOn 14 July 2023, the Nigerian team was disqualified as winners of the women's 4x100 metre relay in

{"title": "Waco_siege", "content": "\nBackground\nThe Branch Davidians (also known as \"The Branch\") were a religious group that originated in 1955 from a schism in the Shepherd's Rod (Davidians) following the death of the Shepherd's Rod founder Victor Houteff Houteff founded the Davidians based on his prophecy of an imminent apocalypse involving the Second Coming of Jesus Christ and the defeat of the evil armies of Babylon [25] As the original Davidian group gained members, its leadership moved the church to a hilltop several miles east of Waco, Texas, which they named Mount Carmel, after a mountain in Israel mentioned in Joshua 19:26 in the Bible's Old Testament [26]\n\n\nPrelude\nIf you are a Branch Davidian, Christ lives on a threadbare piece of land 10 miles  [16 km] east of here called Mount Carmel He has dimples, claims a ninth-grade education, married his legal wife when she was 14, enjoys a beer now and then, plays a mean guitar, reportedly packs a 9 mm Glock and keeps an arsenal of military assault rifles, and willingly admits that he is a sinner without equal.\n\n\nAguilera's affidavit\nThe ATF used an affidavit filed by Special Agent David Aguilera to obtain the search and arrest warrant that led to the Waco siege The official filing date of this affidavit was February 25, 1993 [49] Allegedly, the initial investigation began in June 1992 when a postal worker informed a sheriff of McLennan County that he believed he had been delivering explosives to the ammo and gun store owned and operated by the Branch Davidians This store, named the \"Mag-Bag\", had been identified by the said postal worker as suspicious in deliveries The postal worker continued deliveries to the Mt Carmel Center and reported seeing occupied observation posts; in the affidavit, it states he believed there were armed personnel at these observation posts.\n\n\nATF raid\nUsing the affidavit filed by Aguilera that alleged that the Davidians had violated federal law, the ATF obtained search and arrest warrants for Koresh and specific followers on weapons charges, citing the many firearms they had accumulated [51] [52] The search warrant commanded a search \"on or before February 28, 1993\", in the daytime between 6:00 am and 10:00 pm The ATF made a claim that Koresh was possibly operating a methamphetamine lab, to establish a drug nexus and obtain military assets under the war on drugs [53] Although the ATF's investigation \"focused on firearm violations, not on illegal drugs\", the ATF requested assistance from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the United States Department of Defense (DOD) \"citing a drug connection\" based on 1) a recent delivery to the compound of \"chemicals, instruments, and glassware\", 2) a written testimony from a former compound resident, alleging \"Howell had told him that drug trafficking was a desirable way to raise money\", 3) several current residents who \"had prior drug involvement\", 4) two former residents who were incarcerated for drug-trafficking crimes, and 5) National Guard overflights' thermal images showing a \"hot spot inside the compound, possibly indicating a methamphetamine laboratory\" [53] Although the original request for assistance was initially approved, the commander of the Special Forces detachment questioned the request, and the ATF obtained only a training site at Fort Hood, Texas, from February 25 to February 27 with safety inspections for the training lanes, and was given only medical and communications training and equipment [54]\n\n\nPreparations\nUsing the affidavit filed by Aguilera that alleged that the Davidians had violated federal law, the ATF obtained search and arrest warrants for Koresh and specific followers on weapons charges, citing the many firearms they had accumulated [51] [52] The search warrant commanded a search \"on or before February 28, 1993\", in the daytime between 6:00 am and 10:00 pm The ATF

commander of the Special Forces detachment questioned the request, and the ATF obtained only a training site at Fort Hood, Texas, from February 25 to February 27 with safety inspections for the training lanes, and was given only medical and communications training and equipment [54]\n\n\nFebruary 28\nThe ATF attempted to execute their search warrant on Sunday morning, February 28, 1993 The local sheriff, in audiotapes broadcast after the incident, said he was not apprised of the raid Despite being informed that the Branch Davidians knew a raid was coming, the ATF commander ordered that it go ahead, even though their plan depended on reaching the compound without the Branch Davidians being armed and prepared [44]\n\n\nFBI siege\nATF agents established contact with Koresh and others inside the compound after they withdrew The FBI took command soon after as a result of the deaths of federal agents, placing Jeff Jamar, head of the Bureau's San Antonio field office, in charge of the siege as Site Commander The FBI Hostage Rescue Team (HRT) was headed by HRT Commander Richard Rogers, who had previously been criticized for his actions during the Ruby Ridge incident As at Ruby Ridge, Rogers often overrode the Site Commander at Waco and had mobilized both the Blue and Gold HRT tactical teams to the same site, which ultimately created pressure to resolve the situation tactically due to lack of HRT reserves.\n\n\nFinal assault and the burning of the Mount Carmel Center\nNewly appointed U.S Attorney General Janet Reno approved recommendations by the FBI Hostage Rescue Team to mount an assault, after being told that conditions were deteriorating and that children were being abused inside the compound [69] Reno made the FBI's case to President Clinton Recalling the April 19, 1985, The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord (CSA) siege in Arkansas (which was ended without loss of life by a blockade without a deadline), President Clinton suggested similar tactics against the Branch Davidians Reno countered that the FBI Hostage Rescue Team was tired of waiting; that the standoff was costing a million dollars per week; that the Branch Davidians could hold out longer than the CSA; and that the chances of child sexual abuse and mass suicide were imminent Clinton later recounted: \"Finally, I told her that if she thought it was the right thing to do, she could go ahead.\" [81] Over the next several months, Reno's reason for approving the final tear gas attack varied from her initial claim that the FBI Hostage Rescue Team had told her that Koresh was sexually abusing children and beating babies (the FBI Hostage Rescue Team later denied evidence of child abuse during the standoff [82]) to her claim that Linda Thompson's \"Unorganized Militia of the United States\" was on the way to Waco \"either to help Koresh or to attack him.\" [83]\n\n\nChronology of the events of April 19\nThe new ATF Director, John Magaw, criticized several aspects of the ATF raid Magaw made the Treasury \"Blue Book\" report on Waco required reading for new agents A 1995 Government Accountability Office report on the use of force by federal law enforcement agencies observed that \"On the basis of Treasury's report on the Waco operation and views of tactical operations experts and ATF's own personnel, ATF decided in October 1995 that dynamic entry would only be planned after all other options have been considered and began to adjust its training accordingly.\" [98]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe new ATF Director, John Magaw, criticized several aspects of the ATF raid Magaw made the Treasury \"Blue Book\" report on Waco required reading for new agents A 1995 Government Accountability Office report on the use of force by federal law enforcement agencies observed that \"On the basis of Treasury's report on the Waco operation and views of tactical operations experts and ATF's own personnel, ATF decided in October 1995 that dynamic entry would only be planned after all other options have been considered and began to adjust its training accordingly.\" [98]\n\n\nFBI's post-Waco adjustments\nThe Waco siege prompted the FBI to reevaluate its tactics and procedures The agency made several adjustments in response to the criticism it faced Firstly, there was a greater emphasis on crisis negotiation and peaceful resolutions, leading to increased training and the establishment of specialized negotiation teams Secondly, the Hostage Rescue Team underwent enhancements in terms of training, equipment, and coordination to improve their effectiveness in high-risk operations Additionally, interagency cooperation was emphasized to facilitate better coordination and information sharing among federal entities involved in complex operations The FBI also recognized the value of intelligence gathering and analysis, leading to a focus on enhancing intelligence capabilities Lastly, after-action reviews were conducted, and lessons learned were incorporated into training programs to better prepare agents for future situations.\n\n\nTrial and imprisonments of Branch Davidians\nThe events at Mount Carmel spurred both criminal prosecution and civil litigation On August 3, 1993, a federal grand jury returned a superseding ten-count indictment against 12 of the surviving Branch Davidians The grand jury charged, among other things, that the Branch Davidians had conspired to, and aided and abetted in, the murder of federal officers, and had unlawfully possessed and used various firearms The government dismissed the charges against one of the 12 Branch Davidians according to a plea bargain.\n\n\nCivil suits by Branch Davidians\nSeveral of the surviving Branch Davidians, as well as more than a hundred family members of those who had died or were injured in the confrontation, brought civil suits against the United States government, numerous federal officials, the former governor of Texas Ann Richards, and members of the Texas Army National Guard They sought monetary damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act, civil rights statutes, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and Texas state law The bulk of these claims were dismissed because they were insufficient as a matter of law or because the plaintiffs could advance no material evidence in support of them.\n\n\nPress coverage surrounding the Waco siege\nThe press coverage of the Waco siege was criticized by some [who?] for its sensationalism and for providing a platform for David Koresh and his followers Some journalists were accused of glamorizing Koresh and his beliefs, leading to concerns that the media attention may have unintentionally fueled the cult leader's messianic complex and prolonged the standoff The legal proceedings that followed were complex and involved charges ranging from firearms violations to conspiracy to commit murder Several surviving Branch Davidians faced trial, [109] and some were convicted and sentenced to lengthy prison terms [110] However, the trials themselves were also criticized by some [who?] who believed that the defendants that were fueled by the media did not receive a fair trial or that the government failed to fully investigate its own actions during the siege [citation needed] [111]\n\n\nControversies\nRoland Ballesteros, one of the agents assigned to the ATF door team that assaulted the front door, told Texas Rangers and Waco police that he thought the first shots came from the ATF dog team assigned to neutralize the Branch Davidians' dogs, but later at the trial, he insisted that the Branch Davidians had shot first [112] The Branch Davidians also claimed that the ATF door team opened fire at the door, and they returned fire in self-defense An Austin Chronicle article noted, \"Long before the fire, the Davidians were discussing the evidence contained in the doors During the siege, in a phone conversation with the FBI, Steve Schneider, one of Koresh's main confidants told FBI agents that 'the evidence from the front door will clearly show how many bullets and what happened'.\" [113] Houston attorney Dick DeGuerin, who went inside Mount Carmel during the siege, testified at the trial that protruding metal on the inside of the right-hand entry door made it clear that the bullet holes were made by incoming rounds DeGuerin also testified that only the right-hand entry door had bullet holes, while the left-hand entry door was intact The government presented the left-hand entry door at the trial, claiming that the right-hand entry door had been lost The left-hand door contained numerous bullet holes made by both outgoing and incoming rounds Texas Trooper Sgt David Keys testified that he witnessed two men loading what could have been the missing door into a U-Haul van shortly after the siege had ended, but he did not see the object itself [113] Michael Caddell, the lead attorney for the Branch Davidians' wrongful death lawsuit explained, \"The fact that the left-hand door is in the condition it's in tells you that the right-hand door was not consumed by the fire It was lost on purpose by somebody.\" Caddell offered no evidence to support this allegation, which has never been proven However, fire investigators stated that it was \"extremely unlikely\" that the steel right door could have suffered damage in the fire much greater than did the steel left door, and both doors would have been found together The right door remains missing, and the entire site was under close supervision by law enforcement officials until the debris—including both doors—had been removed [113]\n\n\nDanforth's report\nThe Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995, caused the media to revisit many of the questionable aspects of the government's actions at Waco, and many Americans who previously supported those actions began asking for an investigation of them [125] By 1999—as a result of certain aspects of the documentaries discussed below, as well as allegations made by advocates for Branch Davidians during litigation, public opinion held that the federal government had engaged in serious misconduct at Waco A Time poll conducted on August 26, 1999, for example, indicated that 61 percent of the public believed that federal law enforcement officials started the fire at the Branch Davidian complex.\n\n\nEquipment and manpower\nThe Branch Davidians were well-stocked with small arms, [135] [136] possessing 305 total firearms, including numerous rifles (semi-automatic AK-47s and AR-15s), shotguns, revolvers and pistols; [88] [94] [137] 46 semi-automatic firearms modified to fire in fully automatic mode (included on above list): 22 AR-15 (erroneously referred to as M16), 20 AK-47 rifles, 2 HK SP-89, 2 M-11/Nine [94] [137] Texas Rangers reported \"at least 16 AR-15 rifles,\"; [88] 2 AR-15 lower receivers modified to fire in fully automatic mode; [137] 39 \"auto sear\" devices used to convert semi-automatic weapons into automatic weapons; parts for fully automatic AK-47 and M16 rifles; 30-round magazines and 100-round magazines for M16 and AK-47 rifles; pouches to carry

destroyed the Alfred P Murrah Federal Building, a U.S government office complex in downtown Oklahoma City, and destroyed or damaged numerous other buildings in the vicinity The attack claimed 168 lives (including 19 children under age 6) and left over 600 injured in the deadliest act of terrorism on U.S soil before the September 11 attacks As of 2024, it remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in American history [a]\n\n\nConnection to the Oklahoma City bombing\nTimothy McVeigh cited the Waco incident as a primary motivation [147] for the Oklahoma City bombing, his 19 April 1995

standoff with agents of the FBI The Waco siege, as well as the 1992 incident between the Weaver family and the FBI at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, were still fresh in the public mind, and the FBI was extremely cautious and wanted to prevent a recurrence of those violent events [153] After 81 days of negotiations, the Freemen surrendered to authorities on June 14, 1996, without a loss of life [154]\n\n\nMedia portrayals of Waco\nThe Waco siege has been the subject of numerous documentary films and books The first film was a made-for television docudrama film, In the Line of Duty: Ambush in Waco, which was made during the siege, before the April 19 assault on the church, and presented the initial firefight of February 28, 1993 as an ambush The film's writer, Phil Penningroth, has since disowned his screenplay as pro-ATF \"propaganda\" [155]\n\n\nBooks\n\n\nDocumentaries\nThe first documentary films critical of the official versions were Waco, the Big Lie [158] and Waco II, the Big Lie Continues, both produced by Linda Thompson in 1993 Thompson's films made several controversial allegations, the most notorious of which was her claim that footage of an armored vehicle breaking through the outer walls of the compound, with an appearance of orange light on its front, [159] was showing a flamethrower attached to the vehicle, setting fire to the building As a response to Thompson, Michael McNulty released footage to support his counter-claim that the appearance of light was a reflection on aluminized insulation that was torn from the wall and snagged on the vehicle (The vehicle is an M728 CEV, which is not normally equipped with a flamethrower [160]) McNulty accused Thompson of \"creative editing\" in his film Waco: An Apparent Deviation Thompson worked from a VHS copy of the surveillance tape; McNulty was given access to a beta original However, McNulty in turn was later accused of having digitally altered his footage, an allegation he denied [161]\n\n\nSongs\nGrant Lee Buffalo's 1994 album Mighty Joe Moon opening track \"Lone Star Song\" directly references the siege [171]\n\n\nVideo games\nThe map Oregon from the tactical shooter Rainbow Six Siege, developed and published by Ubisoft, bears a similarity to the Mount Carmel Center [179] Despite the fact that it has not been confirmed by the developers, it has also been seen as a source of inspiration for the map's setting, because the main building closely resembles the Davidians' church While the map does not include the entire compound, comparing the two bears a striking resemblance to the original compound [180]\n\n\nSeries\nThe Waco siege is used as a subplot in the episode “Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub” of South Park S3E8 In the episode the ATF plans to save the day by stopping the ‘cultists’ of a meteor-shower from killing themselves Even if it means they have to “Kill every single one of them” The episode depicted the ATF as incompetent and shows them killing multiple innocent people needlessly [181]\n\n\nPersonal accounts\nBranch Davidian survivor David Thibodeau wrote his account of life in the group and of the siege in the book A Place Called Waco, published in 1999 His book served in part as the basis for the 2018 Paramount Network six-part television drama miniseries Waco, starring Michael Shannon as the FBI negotiator Gary Noesner, Taylor Kitsch as David Koresh, and Rory Culkin as Thibodeau [182] [183] Developed by John Erick Dowdle and Drew Dowdle, it premiered on January 24, 2018.\n\n\nThe Mount Carmel site today\nToday, the site where the Mount Carmel Center sat is occupied by a church built directly atop where the cult building used to be It is still used by the remaining Branch Davidians as a place of worship and memorial A memorial plaque for the four ATF agents killed in the shootout is on the grounds as is the barbed wire the authorities used to prevent the cult members from escaping [186]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nIn the

David Koresh, and the United States government, specifically the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The siege began on February 28, 1993, and ended on April 19, 1993, with the deaths of 76 people, including Koresh and 25 children.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Branch Davidians were a religious group that originated in 1955 from a schism in the Shepherd's Rod (Davidians) following the death of the Shepherd's Rod founder Victor Houteff.

Reno made the FBI's case to President Clinton, who suggested similar tactics against the Branch Davidians as were used against the Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord (CSA) siege in Arkansas. Reno countered that the FBI Hostage Rescue Team was tired of waiting; that the standoff was costing a million dollars per week; that the Branch Davidians could hold out longer than the CSA; and that the chances of child sexual abuse and mass suicide were imminent.\n\n**Chronology of the Events of April 19**\n\nThe new ATF Director, John Magaw, criticized several aspects of the ATF raid. Magaw made the Treasury \"Blue Book\" report on Waco required reading for new agents. A 1995 Government Accountability Office report on the use of force by federal law enforcement agencies observed that \"On the basis of Treasury's report on the Waco operation and views of tactical operations experts and ATF's own personnel, ATF decided in October 1995 that dynamic entry would only be planned after all other options have been considered and began to adjust its training accordingly.\"\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe Waco siege prompted the FBI to reevaluate its tactics and procedures. The agency made several adjustments in response to the criticism it faced. Firstly, there was a greater emphasis on crisis negotiation and peaceful resolutions, leading to increased training and the establishment of specialized negotiation teams. Secondly, the Hostage Rescue Team underwent enhancements in terms of training, equipment, and coordination to improve their effectiveness in high-risk operations. Additionally, interagency cooperation was emphasized to facilitate better coordination and information sharing among federal entities involved in complex operations.\n\n**Trial and Imprisonments of Branch Davidians**\n\nThe events at Mount Carmel spurred both criminal prosecution and civil litigation. On August 3, 1993, a federal grand jury returned a superseding ten-count indictment against 12 of the surviving Branch Davidians. The grand jury charged, among other things, that the Branch Davidians had conspired to, and aided and abetted in, the murder of federal officers, and had unlawfully possessed and used various firearms. The government dismissed the charges against one of the 12 Branch Davidians according to a plea bargain.\n\n**Civil Suits by Branch Davidians**\n\nSeveral of the surviving Branch Davidians, as well as more than a hundred family members of those who had died or were injured in the confrontation, brought civil suits against the United States government, numerous federal officials, the former governor of Texas Ann Richards, and members of the Texas Army National Guard. They sought monetary damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act, civil rights statutes, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and Texas state law. The bulk of these claims were dismissed because they were insufficient as a matter of law or because the plaintiffs could advance no material evidence in support of them.\n\n**Press Coverage Surrounding the Waco Siege**\n\nThe press coverage of the Waco siege was criticized by some for its sensationalism and for providing a platform for David Koresh and his followers. Some journalists were accused of glamorizing Koresh and his beliefs, leading to concerns that the media attention may have unintentionally fueled the cult leader's messianic complex and prolonged the standoff.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nRoland Ballesteros, one of the agents assigned to the ATF door team that assaulted the front door, told Texas Rangers and Waco police that he thought the first shots came from the ATF dog team assigned to neutralize the Branch Davidians' dogs, but later at the trial, he insisted that the Branch Davidians had shot first. The Branch Davidians also claimed that the ATF door team opened fire at the door, and they returned fire in self-defense.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThe Waco siege has had a lasting impact on the United States. The incident was cited as a motivation for the Oklahoma City bombing, which killed 168 people and injured over 600. The siege also led to changes in the way federal law enforcement agencies approach high-risk operations and has been the subject of numerous documentaries, books, and films.\n\n**Connection to the Oklahoma City Bombing**\n\nThe Oklahoma City bombing, which occurred on April 19, 1995, was motivated in part by the Waco siege. Timothy McVeigh, the perpetrator of the bombing, was influenced by the events at Waco and saw the government's actions as a threat to his personal freedoms.\n\n**Montana Freeman Siege**\n\nThe Montana Freemen, a group of anti-government activists, became the center of public attention in 1996 when they engaged in a prolonged armed standoff with agents of the FBI. The Waco siege, as well as the 1992 incident between the Weaver family and the FBI at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, were still fresh in the public mind, and the FBI was extremely cautious and wanted to prevent a recurrence of those violent events.\n\n**Media Portrayals of Waco**\n\nThe Waco siege has been the subject of numerous documentary films and books. The first film was a made-for television docudrama film, In the Line of Duty: Ambush in Waco, which was made during the siege, before the April 19 assault on the church, and presented the initial firefight of February 28, 1993 as an ambush.\n\n**Books**\n\nSeveral books have been written about the Waco siege, including A Place Called Waco by David Thibodeau, a survivor of the siege, and Waco: The Rules of Engagement, a documentary film critical of the official version of events.\n\n**Documentaries**\n\nSeveral documentaries have been made about the Waco siege, including Waco, the Big Lie and Waco II, the Big Lie Continues, both of which were produced by Linda Thompson and present a critical view of the government's actions.\n\n**Songs**\n\nThe Waco siege has been referenced in several songs, including \"Lone Star Song\" by Grant Lee Buffalo, which directly references the siege.\n\n**Video Games**\n\nThe map Oregon from the tactical shooter Rainbow Six Siege, developed and published by Ubisoft, bears a similarity to the Mount Carmel Center and has been seen as a source of inspiration for the map's setting.\n\n**Series**\n\nThe Waco siege is used as a subplot in the episode \"Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub\" of South Park S3E8, which depicts the ATF as incompetent and shows them killing multiple innocent people needlessly.\n\n**Personal Accounts**\n\nDavid Thibodeau, a survivor of the siege, wrote his account of life in the group and of the siege in the book A Place Called Waco, which served as the basis for the 2018 Paramount Network six-part television drama miniseries Waco.\n\n**The Mount Carmel Site Today**\n\nThe site where the Mount Carmel Center sat is occupied by a church built directly atop where the cult building used to be. The church is still used by the remaining Branch Davidians as a place of worship and memorial. A memorial plaque for the four ATF agents killed in the shootout is on the grounds as is the barbed wire the authorities used to prevent the cult members from escaping.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Waco_siege\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nThe Branch Davidians (also known as \"The Branch\") were a religious group that originated in 1955 from a schism in the Shepherd's Rod (Davidians) following the death of the Shepherd's Rod founder Victor Houteff Houteff founded the Davidians based on his prophecy of an imminent apocalypse involving the Second Coming of Jesus Christ and the defeat of the evil armies of Babylon [25] As the original Davidian group gained members, its leadership moved the church to a hilltop several miles east of Waco, Texas, which they named Mount Carmel, after a mountain in Israel mentioned in Joshua 19:26 in the Bible's Old Testament [26]\n\n\nPrelude\nIf you are a Branch Davidian, Christ lives on a threadbare piece of land 10 miles  [16 km] east of here called Mount Carmel He has dimples, claims a ninth-grade education, married his legal wife when she was 14, enjoys a beer now and then, plays a mean guitar, reportedly packs a 9 mm Glock and keeps an arsenal of military assault rifles, and willingly admits that he is a sinner without equal.\n\n\nAguilera's affidavit\nThe ATF used an affidavit filed by Special Agent David Aguilera to obtain the search and arrest warrant that led to the Waco siege The official filing date of this affidavit was February 25, 1993 [49] Allegedly, the initial investigation began in June 1992 when a postal worker informed a sheriff of McLennan County that he believed he had been delivering explosives to the ammo and gun store owned and operated by the Branch Davidians This store, named the \"Mag-Bag\", had been identified by the said postal worker as suspicious in deliveries The postal worker continued deliveries to the Mt Carmel Center and reported seeing occupied observation posts; in the affidavit, it states he believed there were armed personnel at these observation posts.\n\n\nATF raid\nUsing the affidavit filed by Aguilera that alleged that the Davidians had violated federal law, the ATF obtained search and arrest warrants for Koresh and specific followers on weapons charges, citing the many firearms they had accumulated [51] [52] The search warrant commanded a search \"on or before February 28, 1993\", in the daytime between 6:00 am and 10:00 pm The ATF made a claim that Koresh was possibly operating a methamphetamine lab, to establish a drug nexus and obtain military assets under the war on drugs [53] Although the ATF's investigation \"focused on firearm violations, not on illegal drugs\", the ATF requested assistance from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the United States Department of Defense (DOD) \"citing a drug connection\" based on 1) a recent delivery to the compound of \"chemicals, instruments, and glassware\", 2) a written testimony from a former compound resident, alleging \"Howell had told him that drug trafficking was a desirable way to raise money\", 3) several current residents who \"had prior drug involvement\", 4) two former residents who were incarcerated for drug-trafficking crimes, and 5) National Guard overflights' thermal images showing a \"hot spot inside the compound, possibly indicating a methamphetamine laboratory\" [53] Although the original request for assistance was initially approved, the commander of the Special Forces detachment questioned the request, and the ATF obtained only a training site at Fort Hood, Texas, from February 25 to February 27 with safety inspections for the training lanes, and was given only medical and communications training and equipment [54]\n\n\nPreparations\nUsing the affidavit filed by Aguilera that alleged that the Davidians had violated federal law, the ATF obtained search and arrest warrants for Koresh and specific followers on weapons charges, citing the many firearms they had accumulated [51] [52] The search warrant commanded a search \"on or before February 28, 1993\", in the

February 25 to February 27 with safety inspections for the training lanes, and was given only medical and communications training and equipment [54]\n\n\nFebruary 28\nThe ATF attempted to execute their search warrant on Sunday morning, February 28, 1993 The local sheriff, in audiotapes broadcast after the incident, said he was not apprised of the raid Despite being informed that the Branch Davidians knew a raid was coming, the ATF commander ordered that it go ahead, even though their plan depended on reaching the compound without the Branch Davidians being armed and prepared [44]\n\n\nFBI siege\nATF agents established contact with Koresh and others inside the compound after they withdrew The FBI took command soon after as a result of the deaths of federal agents, placing Jeff Jamar, head of the Bureau's San Antonio field office, in charge of the siege as Site Commander The FBI Hostage Rescue Team (HRT) was headed by HRT Commander Richard Rogers, who had previously been criticized for his actions during the Ruby Ridge incident As at Ruby Ridge, Rogers often overrode the Site Commander at Waco and had mobilized both the Blue and Gold HRT tactical teams to the same site, which ultimately created pressure to resolve the situation tactically due to lack of HRT reserves.\n\n\nFinal assault and the burning of the Mount Carmel Center\nNewly appointed U.S Attorney General Janet Reno approved recommendations by the FBI Hostage Rescue Team to mount an assault, after being told that conditions were deteriorating and that children were being abused inside the compound [69] Reno made the FBI's case to President Clinton Recalling the April 19, 1985, The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord (CSA) siege in Arkansas (which was ended without loss of life by a blockade without a deadline), President Clinton suggested similar tactics against the Branch Davidians Reno countered that the FBI Hostage Rescue Team was tired of waiting; that the standoff was costing a million dollars per week; that the Branch Davidians could hold out longer than the CSA; and that the chances of child sexual abuse and mass suicide were imminent Clinton later recounted: \"Finally, I told her that if she thought it was the right thing to do, she could go ahead.\" [81] Over the next several months, Reno's reason for approving the final tear gas attack varied from her initial claim that the FBI Hostage Rescue Team had told her that Koresh was sexually abusing children and beating babies (the FBI Hostage Rescue Team later denied evidence of child abuse during the standoff [82]) to her claim that Linda Thompson's \"Unorganized Militia of the United States\" was on the way to Waco \"either to help Koresh or to attack him.\" [83]\n\n\nChronology of the events of April 19\nThe new ATF Director, John Magaw, criticized several aspects of the ATF raid Magaw made the Treasury \"Blue Book\" report on Waco required reading for new agents A 1995 Government Accountability Office report on the use of force by federal law enforcement agencies observed that \"On the basis of Treasury's report on the Waco operation and views of tactical operations experts and ATF's own personnel, ATF decided in October 1995 that dynamic entry would only be planned after all other options have been considered and began to adjust its training accordingly.\"

was a greater emphasis on crisis negotiation and peaceful resolutions, leading to increased training and the establishment of specialized negotiation teams Secondly, the Hostage Rescue Team underwent enhancements in terms of training, equipment, and coordination to improve their effectiveness in high-risk operations Additionally, interagency cooperation was emphasized to facilitate better coordination and information sharing among federal entities involved in complex operations The FBI also recognized the value of intelligence gathering and analysis, leading to a focus on enhancing intelligence capabilities Lastly, after-action reviews were conducted, and lessons learned were incorporated into training programs to better prepare agents for future situations.\n\n\nTrial and imprisonments of Branch Davidians\nThe events at Mount Carmel spurred both criminal prosecution and civil litigation On August 3, 1993, a federal grand jury returned a superseding ten-count indictment against 12 of the surviving Branch Davidians The grand jury charged, among other things, that the Branch Davidians had conspired to, and aided and abetted in, the murder of federal officers, and had unlawfully possessed and used various firearms The government dismissed the charges against one of the 12 Branch Davidians according to a plea bargain.\n\n\nCivil suits by Branch Davidians\nSeveral of the surviving Branch Davidians, as well as more than a hundred family members of those who had died or were injured in the confrontation, brought civil suits against the United States government, numerous federal officials, the former governor of Texas Ann Richards, and members of the Texas Army National Guard They sought monetary damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act, civil rights statutes, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and Texas state law The bulk of these claims were dismissed because they were insufficient as a matter of law or because the plaintiffs could advance no material evidence in support of them.\n\n\nPress coverage surrounding the Waco siege\nThe press coverage of the Waco siege was criticized by some [who?] for its sensationalism and for providing a platform for David Koresh and his followers Some journalists were accused of glamorizing Koresh and his beliefs, leading to concerns that the media attention may have unintentionally fueled the cult leader's messianic complex and prolonged the standoff The legal proceedings that followed were complex and involved charges ranging from firearms violations to conspiracy to commit murder Several surviving Branch Davidians faced trial, [109] and some were convicted and sentenced to lengthy prison terms [110] However, the trials themselves were also criticized by some [who?] who believed that the defendants that were fueled by the media did not receive a fair trial or that the government failed to fully investigate its own actions during the siege [citation needed] [111]\n\n\nControversies\nRoland Ballesteros, one of the agents assigned to the ATF door team that assaulted the front door, told Texas Rangers and Waco police that he thought the first shots came from the ATF dog team assigned to neutralize the Branch Davidians' dogs, but later at the trial, he insisted that the Branch Davidians had shot first [112] The Branch Davidians also claimed that the ATF door team opened fire at the door, and they returned fire in self-defense An Austin Chronicle article noted, \"Long before the fire, the Davidians were discussing the evidence contained in the doors During the siege, in a phone conversation with the FBI, Steve Schneider, one of Koresh's main confidants told FBI agents that 'the evidence from the front door will clearly show how many bullets and what happened'.\" [113] Houston attorney Dick DeGuerin, who went inside Mount Carmel during the siege, testified at the trial that protruding metal on the inside of the right-hand entry door made it clear that the bullet holes were made by incoming rounds DeGuerin also testified that only the right-hand entry door had bullet holes, while the left-hand entry door was intact The government presented the left-hand entry door at the trial, claiming that the right-hand entry door had been lost The left-hand door contained numerous bullet holes made by both outgoing and incoming rounds Texas Trooper Sgt David Keys testified that he witnessed two men loading what could have been the missing door into a U-Haul van shortly after the siege had ended, but he did not see the object itself [113] Michael Caddell, the lead attorney for the Branch Davidians' wrongful death lawsuit explained, \"The fact that the left-hand door is in the condition it's in tells you that the right-hand door was not consumed by the fire It was lost on purpose by somebody.\" Caddell offered no evidence to support this allegation, which has never been proven However, fire investigators stated that it was \"extremely unlikely\" that the steel right door could have suffered damage in the fire much greater than did the steel left door, and both doors would have been found together The right door remains missing, and the entire site was under close supervision by law enforcement officials until the debris—including both doors—had been removed [113]\n\n\nDanforth's report\nThe Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995, caused the media to revisit many of the questionable aspects of the government's actions at Waco, and many Americans who previously supported those actions began asking for an investigation of them [125] By 1999—as a result of certain aspects of the documentaries discussed below, as well as allegations made by advocates for Branch Davidians during litigation, public opinion held that the federal government had engaged in serious misconduct at Waco A Time poll conducted on August 26, 1999, for example, indicated that 61 percent of the public believed that federal law enforcement officials started the fire at the Branch Davidian complex.\n\n\nEquipment and manpower\nThe Branch Davidians were well-stocked with small arms, [135] [136] possessing 305 total firearms, including numerous rifles (semi-automatic AK-47s and AR-15s), shotguns, revolvers and pistols; [88] [94] [137] 46 semi-automatic firearms modified to fire in fully automatic mode (included on above list): 22 AR-15 (erroneously referred to as M16), 20 AK-47 rifles, 2 HK SP-89, 2 M-11/Nine [94] [137] Texas Rangers reported \"at least 16 AR-15 rifles,\"; [88] 2 AR-15 lower receivers modified to fire in fully automatic mode; [137] 39 \"auto sear\" devices used to convert semi-automatic weapons into automatic weapons; parts for fully automatic AK-47 and M16 rifles; 30-round magazines and 100-round magazines for M16 and AK-47 rifles; pouches to carry large ammunition magazines; substantial quantities of ammunition of various sizes.\n\n\nGovernment

motivation [147] for the Oklahoma City bombing, his 19 April 1995 truck bomb attack that destroyed the Alfred P Murrah Federal Building, a U.S government office complex in downtown Oklahoma City, and destroyed or damaged numerous other buildings in the vicinity The attack claimed 168 lives (including 19 children under age 6) and left over 600 injured in the deadliest act of terrorism on U.S soil before the September 11 attacks As of 2024, it remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in American history [a]\n\n\nConnection to the Oklahoma City bombing\nTimothy McVeigh cited the Waco

became the center of public attention in 1996 when they engaged in a prolonged armed standoff with agents of the FBI The Waco siege, as well as the 1992 incident between the Weaver family and the FBI at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, were still fresh in the public mind, and the FBI was extremely cautious and wanted to prevent a recurrence of those violent events [153] After 81 days of negotiations, the Freemen surrendered to authorities on June 14, 1996, without a loss of life [154]\n\n\nMedia portrayals of Waco\nThe Waco siege has been the subject of numerous documentary films and books The first film was a made-for television docudrama film, In the Line of Duty: Ambush in Waco, which was made during the siege, before the April 19 assault on the church, and presented the initial firefight of February 28, 1993 as an ambush The film's writer, Phil Penningroth, has since disowned his screenplay as pro-ATF \"propaganda\" [155]\n\n\nBooks\n\n\nDocumentaries\nThe first documentary films critical of the official versions were Waco, the Big Lie [158] and Waco II, the Big Lie Continues, both produced by Linda Thompson in 1993 Thompson's films made several controversial allegations, the most notorious of which was her claim that footage of an armored vehicle breaking through the outer walls of the compound, with an appearance of orange light on its front, [159] was showing a flamethrower attached to the vehicle, setting fire to the building As a response to Thompson, Michael McNulty released footage to support his counter-claim that the appearance of light was a reflection on aluminized insulation that was torn from the wall and snagged on the vehicle (The vehicle is an M728 CEV, which is not normally equipped with a flamethrower [160]) McNulty accused Thompson of \"creative editing\" in his film Waco: An Apparent Deviation Thompson worked from a VHS copy of the surveillance tape; McNulty was given access to a beta original However, McNulty in turn was later accused of having digitally altered his footage, an allegation he denied [161]\n\n\nSongs\nGrant Lee Buffalo's 1994 album Mighty Joe Moon opening track \"Lone Star Song\" directly references the siege [171]\n\n\nVideo games\nThe map Oregon from the tactical shooter Rainbow Six Siege, developed and published by Ubisoft, bears a similarity to the Mount Carmel Center [179] Despite the fact that it has not been confirmed by the developers, it has also been seen as a source of inspiration for the map's setting, because the main building closely resembles the Davidians' church While the map does not include the entire compound, comparing the two bears a striking resemblance to the original compound [180]\n\n\nSeries\nThe Waco siege is used as a subplot in the episode “Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub” of South Park S3E8 In the episode the ATF plans to save the day by stopping the ‘cultists’ of a meteor-shower from killing themselves Even if it means they have to “Kill every single one of them” The episode depicted the ATF as incompetent and shows them killing multiple innocent people needlessly [181]\n\n\nPersonal accounts\nBranch Davidian survivor David Thibodeau wrote his account of life in the group and of the siege in the book A Place Called Waco, published in 1999 His book served in part as the basis for the 2018 Paramount Network six-part television drama miniseries Waco, starring Michael Shannon as the FBI negotiator Gary Noesner, Taylor Kitsch as David Koresh, and Rory Culkin as Thibodeau [182] [183] Developed by John Erick Dowdle and Drew Dowdle, it premiered on January 24, 2018.\n\n\nThe Mount Carmel site today\nToday, the site where the Mount Carmel Center sat is occupied by a church built directly atop where the cult building used to be It is still used by the remaining Branch Davidians as a place of worship and memorial A memorial plaque for the four ATF agents killed in the shootout is on the grounds as is the barbed wire the authorities used to prevent the cult members from escaping [186]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nIn the United States\n\n\nInternational\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

it is arguably a little actorly and unlike the behaviour of any real villain But it is a very funny, intelligent performance nonetheless, beautifully scripted and acted, and Kingsley tops it off with a bravura show of pure sociopathic cunning\" [38] Kingsley's role as Logan earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor A year later, he won a Crystal Globe award for having an outstanding artistic contribution to world cinema at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival [39] In 2003 he portrayed Colonel Massoud Amir Behrani in the Vadim Perelman directed House of Sand and Fog acting opposite Jennifer Connelly and Shohreh Aghdashloo Critic Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote of his performance, \"Kingsley, carrying his body like armor, sculpting each line into a bitter dart of pride, plays fierceness with a powerful tug of sorrow.\" [40] For his role he earned nominations for the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and Independent Spirit Award for Best Actor [41] [42] The following year he played a supporting role as Benjamin O'Ryan in the psychological thriller Suspect Zero (2004) Although the film received negative reviews from critics, reservations were made for Kingsley's performance.\n\n\nPersonal life\nKingsley has been married four times and has four children: Thomas Bhanji and artist Jasmin Bhanji, with first wife, actress Angela Morant, and Edmund Kingsley and Ferdinand Kingsley, both of whom became actors, with second wife, theatrical director Alison Sutcliffe [56] He divorced his third wife Alexandra Christmann in 2005, having been \"deeply, deeply shocked\" after pictures of her kissing another man surfaced on the internet [57] On 3 September 2007, Kingsley married Brazilian actress Daniela Lavender at Eynsham Hall in North Leigh, Oxfordshire [58]\n\n\nMarriage and family\nKingsley has been married four times and has four children: Thomas Bhanji and artist Jasmin Bhanji, with first wife, actress Angela Morant, and Edmund Kingsley and Ferdinand Kingsley, both of whom became actors, with second wife, theatrical director Alison Sutcliffe [56] He divorced his third wife Alexandra Christmann in 2005, having been \"deeply, deeply shocked\" after pictures of her kissing another man surfaced on the internet [57] On 3 September 2007, Kingsley married Brazilian actress Daniela Lavender at Eynsham Hall in North Leigh, Oxfordshire [58]\n\n\nCharity\nKingsley appeared in a production of The Children's Monologues in 2010 on stage in London alongside Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Hiddleston, Gemma Arterton, and Eddie Redmayne [59] It was performed on behalf of Dramatic Need, a charity that sends international arts professionals (such as musicians, artists, and actors) to host workshops in underprivileged and rural communities in Africa [60]\n\n\nFilmography\nKingsley won an Academy Award in the Best Actor category for Gandhi, and has been nominated three more times: Best Supporting Actor for Bugsy and Sexy Beast, and Best Actor for House of Sand and Fog (2003) In 1984, Kingsley won a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word or Nonmusical Recording for The Words of Gandhi, received an honorary degree from the University of Salford, [61] and was awarded the Indian civilian honour Padma Shri [62]\nHe was made a Knight Bachelor in the 2002 New Year Honours for services to the British film industry [1] [63] The award was announced on 31 December 2001, which happened to be Kingsley's 58th birthday [64] After being knighted by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace, Kingsley stated:\n\nAwards and nominations\nKingsley won an Academy Award in the Best Actor category for Gandhi, and has been nominated three more times: Best Supporting Actor for Bugsy and Sexy Beast, and Best Actor for House of Sand and Fog (2003) In 1984, Kingsley won a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word or Nonmusical Recording for The Words of Gandhi, received an honorary degree from the University of Salford, [61] and was awarded the Indian civilian honour Padma Shri [62]\nHe was made a Knight Bachelor in the 2002 New Year Honours for services to the British film industry [1] [63] The award was announced on 31 December 2001, which happened to be Kingsley's 58th birthday [64] After being knighted by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace, Kingsley stated:\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Ben Kingsley\n\nBen Kingsley is a British actor known for his extensive and varied career in film, television, and theater.

1943, in Snainton, North Riding of Yorkshire [4] [5] [6] His mother, Anna Lyna Mary (née Goodman) (1914–2010), was an English actress and model, and she later gave birth to a second son called Sadru Bhanji, who later worked as a psychiatrist in Devon She was born out of wedlock and \"was loath to speak of her background\" [7] [8] [9] His father, Rahimtulla Harji Bhanji (1914–1968), was born in Zanzibar (now part of Tanzania) to a family originating from the Indian city of Jamnagar, of Khoja Gujarati descent [10] [11] Kingsley's paternal grandfather, Harji Bhanji, was a successful spice trader who had moved from India to the Sultanate of Zanzibar, where Kingsley's father lived until moving to the United Kingdom at the age of 14 [12] [13] [14] Kingsley's maternal grandfather was believed by the family to have been of Russian- or German-Jewish descent, while his maternal grandmother was English and worked in the garment district of London's East End [15] Kingsley stated in 1994, \"I'm not Jewish, and though there might be some Russian-Jewish heritage way back on my mother's side, the thread is so fine there's no real evidence.\" [16] In a 2016 interview, he indicated that his maternal grandmother was impregnated by a Russian-Jewish immigrant who later abandoned her, which led her to become a \"vile anti-Semite.\" [17]\n\n\nCareer\nAfter graduating, in 1966, Kingsley was approached by music producer and manager Dick James James, who was the publisher of The Beatles, offered to mould Kingsley into a pop star Kingsley declined James' offer, and instead chose to join the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in 1967 after an audition before Trevor Nunn [20] Devoting himself almost exclusively to stage work for the next 15 years, he made his West End debut for the company at the Aldwych Theatre in 1967 in a production of As You Like It [21] Further productions for the RSC included Much Ado About Nothing, Richard III, The Tempest, A Midsummer Night's

peacemaker Mahatma Gandhi The film was a critical and financial success with film critic Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times praising the casting of Kingsley in the lead role writing, \"makes the role so completely his own that there is a genuine feeling that the spirit of Gandhi is on the screen Kingsley's performance is powerful without being loud or histrionic; he is almost always quiet, observant, and soft-spoken on the screen, and yet his performance comes across with such might that we realize, afterward, that the sheer moral force of Gandhi must have been behind the words.\" [28] Kingsley went on to win numerous accolades for his performance including the Academy Award for Best Actor, the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama for his performance [22] The following year he acted in the British drama film Betrayal (1983), an adaptation of the 1978 play of the same title by Harold Pinter Kingsley starred

Bradshaw of The Guardian praised his performance writing, \"The role of Don Logan is perfectly suited to Ben Kingsley's gifts for control and stillness There is something a little baroque and stylised about his approach - it is arguably a little actorly and unlike the behaviour of any real villain But it is a very funny, intelligent performance nonetheless, beautifully scripted and acted, and Kingsley tops it off with a bravura show of pure sociopathic cunning\" [38] Kingsley's role as Logan earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor A year later, he won a Crystal Globe award for having an outstanding artistic contribution to world cinema at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival [39] In 2003 he portrayed Colonel Massoud Amir Behrani in the Vadim Perelman directed House of Sand and Fog acting opposite Jennifer Connelly and Shohreh Aghdashloo Critic Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote of his performance, \"Kingsley, carrying his body like armor, sculpting each line into a bitter dart of pride, plays fierceness with a powerful tug of sorrow.\" [40] For his role he earned nominations for the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and Independent Spirit Award for Best Actor [41] [42] The following year he played a supporting role as Benjamin O'Ryan in the psychological thriller Suspect Zero (2004) Although the film received

He is best known for his association with Princess Anne and for being the subject of media attention surrounding their rumored relationship.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nTimothy James Hamilton Laurence was born on 1 March 1955 in Camberwell, South London, to Commander Guy Stewart Laurence and Barbara Alison Laurence (née Symons). He has an older brother, Jonathan Dobree Laurence. The Laurence family has a long history, with roots dating back to the late 18th century when Zaccaria Levy, a Jewish merchant from Venice, arrived in England. The family name was later changed to Laurence.\n\nLaurence's early life was marked by a strong naval influence, with his father serving in the Royal Navy. This exposure likely shaped his own career path, as he went on to follow in his father's footsteps. Laurence was educated at Durham, where he completed his initial training before being commissioned as a midshipman in the Royal Navy.\n\n**Naval Career**\n\nLaurence's naval career spanned several decades, with various postings and promotions throughout. He was commissioned as a midshipman in the Royal Navy on 1 January 1973 and made an acting sub-lieutenant on 1 January 1975. Upon leaving Durham, Laurence completed his initial training at the Britannia Royal Naval College Dartmouth, and was posted to HMS Aurora, a Plymouth-based frigate. This marked the beginning of his naval career, during which he would go on to serve in various roles and capacities.\n\nLaurence's career progression was rapid, with promotions coming at a relatively quick pace. He was promoted to lieutenant 10 months early, on 1 March 1977, a testament to his hard work and dedication. In 1978, Laurence was attached to the training establishment HMS Vernon and in the next year served on the Ton-class minesweeper HMS Pollington. These postings demonstrate his versatility and adaptability as a naval officer.\n\n**Later Career**\n\nLaurence's later career saw him take on various roles, both within and outside the naval service. From January 1999, he was Hudson Visiting Fellow at St Antony's College, Oxford, where he wrote a paper on the relationship between humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping. This marked a significant departure from his naval career, as he explored the intersection of politics and humanitarianism.\n\nLaurence's time at St Antony's College was followed by a posting to the Joint Services Command and Staff College as a commodore, as Assistant Commandant (Navy), effective 15 June 1999. This role saw him take on a leadership position within the naval service, overseeing the training and development of naval officers. From 2001 to the spring of 2004, Laurence was back at the Ministry of Defence, as Director of Navy Resources and Programmes. This marked a return to the heart of the naval service, where he oversaw the development of naval resources and programs.\n\n**Marriage**\n\nLaurence's personal life has been the subject of significant media attention, particularly surrounding his relationship with Princess Anne. The two met when Laurence served as an equerry to Queen Elizabeth II in 1986, at a time when it was much rumored that her first marriage to Captain Mark Phillips was breaking down. This marked the beginning of a long and complex relationship between Laurence and the Princess Royal.\n\nThe existence of private letters from Laurence to the Princess was revealed by The Sun newspaper in 1989, though it did not name the sender. Buckingham Palace issued a statement, acknowledging the letters were addressed to the Princess Royal by Commander Timothy Laurence, the Queen's Equerry. The contents of the letters remain private, but the revelation sparked significant media attention and speculation about the nature of their relationship.\n\n**Honours**\n\nLaurence has received several honors and awards throughout his career, a testament to his dedication and service to the naval service.

has been supported on Windows Server 2022 [4] One of the key features of the new release is that Exchange Server can be deployed onto Windows Server Core for the first time Additionally, Microsoft has retired the Unified Messaging feature of Exchange, meaning that Skype for Business on-premises customers will have to use alternative solutions for voicemail, such as Azure cloud voicemail.\n\n\nNew features\nExchange Server Enterprise Edition supports clustering of up to 4 nodes when using Windows 2000 Server, and up to 8 nodes with Windows Server 2003 Exchange Server 2003 also introduced active-active clustering, but for two-node clusters only In this setup, both servers in the cluster are allowed to be active simultaneously This is opposed to Exchange's more common active-passive mode in which the failover servers in any cluster node cannot be used at all while their corresponding home servers are active They must wait, inactive, for the home servers in the node to fail Subsequent performance issues with active-active mode have led Microsoft to recommend that it should no longer be used [5] In fact, support for active-active mode clustering has been discontinued with

now it is part of the network of Paris public hospitals [16]\n\n\nThe Canons' Quarter\nMost of the very old residential quarters on the island were destroyed by Napoleon III and Baron Haussmann in the 19th century Only one small area remains: the Canons' Quarter (Quartier des Chainoines), located between the Quai aux Fleurs, the rue d'Arcole and the rue du Cloitre-Notre Dame In the 16th century it was the residence of many of the canons of the cathedral It was closed to the outside world by gates, no commerce was permitted, and no women were allowed except those of \"respectable age\" [26] Several residences remain from this period; the house at 24 rue Chanoinesse, from about 1512, has large doors leading to an interior courtyard and dormer windows jutting up from the roof It is now covered with wisteria Another good example is found at 12 Rue Chanoinesse.\n\n\nQuai de l'Horloge and the Palace of Justice\nThe old royal palace lay along the Quai de l'Horloge, on the northeast side of the island With the departure of the kings of France to the Louvre and then to Versailles, the palace gradually was transformed into the judicial center of the Kingdom, containing the courts, administrative offices and a prison.\n\n\nThe Sainte-Chapelle\nThe Sainte-Chapelle was the royal chapel, located in the courtyard of the palace It was created by Louis IX (later Saint Louis) to display sacred relics of the Crucifixion; particularly the Crown of Thorns that he purchased in 1239 from the Emperor of Constantinople He later added what was believed to be a fragment of the true cross Work was already underway by 1241, and it was consecrated in 1248 [34]\n\n\nQuai des Orfèvres\nThe Quai des Orfèvres, \"The Quay of the Goldmsiths and Silversmiths\", is on the southwestern side of the island, alongside the Palace of Justice and the Place Dauphine In its earlier days, a poultry market was held here; as a result policemen were referred to by the slang term \"poulets\" or \"chickens\" [37] Its current name dates from the 17th and 18th centuries, when many celebrated Paris jewellers had their shops here; including Boehmer and Bassenge - who made a famous necklace for Marie-Antoinette - and Georg Friedrich Strass, who invented both the rhinestone and the synthetic diamond.\n\n\nThe Rue de Harlay and the Cour de Cassation of the Palais de Justice\nRue de Harlay runs across the island on the northwest side, separating the Palais de Justice from the Place Dauphine It is named for Achille de Harlay, the first president of the Parlement of Paris in the early 17th century; his house stood in that location until it was demolished for the enlargement of the Palace of Justice The building of the Cour de Cassation, a kind of French Supreme Court, looks over the Place Dauphine  Its highly theatrical facade was designed by Joseph-Louis Duc, whose other famous Paris work is the July Column in the Place de la Bastille It features marble classical columns, pediments and bas-reliefs;  there are sculpted lions on the grand stairways, eagles on the roof and statues of famous jurists in togas along the facade Like the Paris Opera of the same period, it is in the style of Napoleon III It was nearly completed in 1871 when Napoleon III was deposed The Paris Commune set fire to the unfinished palace, partially destroying it; but it was later restored and completed.\n\n\nPlace Dauphine\nThe triangular Place Dauphine, at the downstream end of the island, was originally the garden of the royal palace Known as \"The King's Orchard\", it was filled with vegetable gardens, fruit trees and flower beds Beginning in 1609 King Henry IV turned it into a residential square, facing the palace, similar to the square he began at the Place des Vosges a few years earlier It was named for his son, the Dauphin of France (the future Louis XIII) [b] He asked the president of the Parliament, Achille de Harlay  [fr] to develop it Twelve lots were sold, and forty-five irregularly sized houses were constructed behind a standardised façade [39] The houses were built of brick, with limestone quoins supported on arcaded stone ground floors and capped by steep slate roofs with dormers - similar to the façades of Place des Vosges Each house had a ground floor of arcades occupied by shops; two floors of living space; and an attic with skylights [40]\n\n\nThe Pont Neuf and the Square du Vert Galant\nThe Pont Neuf, completed in 1606, was the first bridge in Paris to cross the entire length of the Seine, and the first that was not lined with houses [44] It was the project of Henry IV  After the assassination of the king in 1610, it became the site of another innovation: the first equestrian statue in Paris Commissioned in 1614 by Marie de' Medici - the widow and regent of the king - it was modelled after the equestrian statues of her native Italy Giambologna completed the commission in 1618 The statue was destroyed in 1792 during the French Revolution, but was replaced in 1817 by the royal sculptor François Lemot, using casts of the original [45]\n\n\nBridges\nFrom early times wooden bridges linked the island to the riverbanks on either side The Grand Pont (or Pont au Change) spanned the wider reach to the Right Bank, while the Petit Pont crossed the narrower channel to the Left Bank The first stone bridge was built in 1378 at the site of the present Pont Saint-Michel; but ice floes carried it away, along with all the houses on it, 1408 [c] The Grand Pont or Pont Notre-Dame - also swept away at intervals by floodwaters - and the Petit Pont were rebuilt by Fra Giovanni Giocondo at the beginning of the 16th century.\nThe six arches of the Pont Notre-Dame supported gabled houses, some of half-timbered construction, until all were demolished in 1786 [d]\n\n\nTransport\nThe island has one Paris Métro station: Cité There is also one RER station: Saint-Michel-Notre-Dame, although on the Left Bank, has an exit on the island in front of the cathedral.\n\n\nNotes\n48°51′17″N 2°20′51″E﻿ / ﻿48.85472°N 2.34750°E﻿ / 48.85472;

It is one of the most historic and culturally significant areas in the city, dating back to the ancient times. The island is home to some of the most iconic landmarks in Paris, including the Notre-Dame Cathedral, the Sainte-Chapelle, and the Conciergerie. This article will provide an overview of the history, description, and notable features of Île de la Cité.\n\nHistory\nA Gallic settlement, called Lutetia, may have existed on the island since at least the 3rd century BC. The nearby area was inhabited by the Parisii, a small Gallic tribe. The island may have served them as a convenient place to cross the Seine, a base for a flourishing trading network by river, and a place of refuge in times of invasion. However, no significant traces of a settlement earlier than the 1st century AD have been found to date on the island.\n\nEarly History\nA Gallic settlement, called Lutetia, may have existed on the island since at least the 3rd century BC. The nearby area was inhabited by the Parisii, a small Gallic tribe. The island may have served them as a convenient place to cross the Seine, a base for a flourishing trading network by river, and a place of refuge in times of invasion. However, no significant traces of a settlement earlier than the 1st century AD have been found to date on the island.\n\n12th-17th Century\nLouis IX built his new chapel, the jewel-like Sainte-Chapelle, between 1242 and 1248. During the same period, the most famous landmark of the island was constructed: the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris. An earlier cathedral, the Cathedral of Saint-Etienne, had been constructed in the Romanesque style. In 1160, the bishop of Paris, Maurice de Sully, began construction of a cathedral in the new Gothic style, to match the magnificence of the palace. The first stones of the foundation of the new cathedral were laid by Pope Alexander III, in 1163. Its construction spanned two centuries.\n\n18th Century\nIn the 18th century, the Conciergerie on the island became the scene of some of the most dramatic events of the French Revolution. In 1788, the Constituent Assembly, meeting in the former royal palace, refused the demands of Louis XVI to turn over some of its members. In 1790, Jean Sylvain Bailly, the mayor of Paris, sealed the doors of the royal palace. In August 1793, Queen Marie-Antoinette was taken to the Conciergerie, where she was imprisoned. After two and a half months, she was tried, convicted, and sentenced to the guillotine. In September 1793, the radical Sans-Culottes stormed the Conciergerie and massacred the remaining royalist prisoners. On 27 July 1795, it was the turn of the revolutionary leader Robespierre to be arrested, brought to the Conciergerie, tried, and sent to the guillotine.\n\n19th-20th Century\nIn the early 19th century, with the restoration of the monarchy, the old palace was substantially rebuilt for its function as the center of the judicial system. An expiatory chapel was built where the cell of Marie-Antoinette had been. Between 1820 and 1828, the façade between the Tower of the Horloge and the Tower of Bonbec was rebuilt. It remained a prison; the future Napoleon III was imprisoned there for a time following a failed attempt to overthrow the government.\n\nMap\nThe Place de l'Île de la Cité is a small park located at the extreme eastern tip of the island, behind the cathedral. It originally was a separate island, called La Motte-aux-Papelards, made up in part of debris from the construction of the cathedral. In 1864, Baron Haussmann chose it as the new site for the Paris morgue, which remained there for fifty years.\n\nDescription\nThe Place de l'Île de la Cité is a small park located at the extreme eastern tip of the island, behind the cathedral. It originally was a separate island, called La Motte-aux-Papelards, made up in part of debris from the construction of the cathedral. In 1864, Baron Haussmann chose it as the new site for the Paris morgue, which remained there for fifty years.\n\nThe Cathedral and Parvis of Notre-Dame\nThe Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris is among the most visible and celebrated landmarks of Paris. Construction began in 1163, next to the older Romanesque Cathedral of Saint Etienne, Paris, and was largely completed by 1345. It is among the largest Gothic cathedrals in Europe, with a seating capacity of six-and-a-half thousand. The flèche, or Spire of Notre-Dame de Paris, originally built in 1220–1230, was removed in the 17th century, then rebuilt by Eugene Viollet-Le-Duc in the mid-19th century. At ninety-six meters high, it was the tallest structure in Paris until the construction of the Eiffel Tower. The spire and much of the roof were destroyed by the Notre-Dame de Paris fire on 15 April 2019, and the cathedral has been closed for restoration ever since. It is expected to re-open in December 2024.\n\nPlace Louis-Lepine, the Flower Market and the Tribunal of Commerce\nA large square – Place Louis-Lepine – is located in the center of the island, in front of the Prefecture of Police. It hosts a famous flower market, which was created by an ordinance of Napoleon in January 1808. It occupies the space between Place-Louis Lepine and the Seine. In 2016 the market was renamed the Marché aux fleurs Reine-Elizabeth-II, during the visit of Queen Elizabeth II to Paris. On Sundays, it also becomes a large market for live birds and other pets. The square is the location of the only metro station on the island, with an Art Nouveau portal designed by Hector Guimard. The metro station is unusually deep – twenty meters underground – because the tunnel carrying the trains must pass underneath the River Seine.\n\nThe Hôtel-Dieu\nThe Hôtel-Dieu, located between the Parvis of Notre-Dame on the south and the Quai de la Corse on the north, is the oldest hospital in Paris. It is reputed to be the oldest still-functioning hospital in the world. Tradition says it was founded in 651 by Saint Landry, Bishop of Paris. It was originally located on the other side of the Parvis, along the river, with a second building on the left Bank of the Seine. The old hospital was famous for its overcrowding, with several patients in each bed. It was rebuilt several times. During the French Revolution, it was re-named the \"House of Humanity\", in keeping with the secular principles of the revolution. The present hospital was begun by Napoleon III in 1863 and completed in 1877. The design, in an Italian Renaissance style, was by the architect Arthur-Stanislas Diet. It has several buildings, connected by porticos. Until 1908, care in the hospital was provided by nuns; now it is part of the network of Paris public hospitals.\n\nThe Canons' Quarter\nMost of the very old residential quarters on the island were destroyed by Napoleon III and Baron Haussmann in the 19th century. Only one small area remains: the Canons' Quarter (Quartier des Chainoines), located between the Quai aux Fleurs, the rue d'Arcole and the rue du Cloitre-Notre Dame. In the 16th century, it was the residence of many of the canons of the cathedral. It was closed to the outside world by gates, no commerce was permitted, and no women were allowed except those of \"respectable age\". Several residences remain from this period; the house at 24 rue Chanoinesse, from about 1512, has large doors leading to an interior courtyard and dormer windows jutting up from the roof. It is now covered with wisteria. Another good example is found at 12 Rue Chanoinesse.\n\nQuai de l'Horloge and the Palace of Justice\nThe old royal palace lay along the Quai de l'Horloge, on the northeast side of the island. With the departure of the kings of France to the Louvre and then to Versailles, the palace gradually was transformed into the judicial center of the Kingdom, containing the courts, administrative offices and a prison.\n\nThe Sainte-Chapelle\nThe Sainte-Chapelle was the royal chapel, located in the courtyard of the palace. It was created by Louis IX (later Saint Louis) to display sacred relics of the Crucifixion; particularly the Crown of Thorns that he purchased in 1239 from the Emperor of Constantinople. He later added what was believed to be a fragment of the true cross. Work was already underway by 1241, and it was consecrated in 1248.\n\nQuai des Orfèvres\nThe Quai des Orfèvres, \"The Quay of the Goldsmiths and Silversmiths\", is on the southwestern side of the island, alongside the Palace of Justice and the Place Dauphine. In its earlier days, a poultry market was held here; as a result, policemen were referred to by the slang term \"poulets\" or \"chickens\". Its current name dates from the 17th and 18th centuries, when many celebrated Paris jewellers had their shops here; including Boehmer and Bassenge – who made a famous necklace for Marie-Antoinette – and Georg Friedrich Strass, who invented both the rhinestone and the synthetic diamond.\n\nThe Rue de Harlay and the Cour de Cassation of the Palais de Justice\nRue de Harlay runs across the island on the northwest side, separating the Palais de Justice from the Place Dauphine. It is named for Achille de Harlay, the first president of the Parlement of Paris in the early 17th century; his house stood in that location until it was demolished for the enlargement of the Palace of Justice. The building of the Cour de Cassation, a kind of French Supreme Court, looks over the Place Dauphine. Its highly theatrical facade was designed by Joseph-Louis Duc, whose other famous Paris work is the July Column in the Place de la Bastille. It features marble classical columns, pediments and bas-reliefs; there are sculpted lions on the grand stairways, eagles on the roof and statues of famous jurists in togas along the facade. Like the Paris Opera of the same period, it is in the style of Napoleon III. It was nearly completed in 1871 when Napoleon III was deposed. The Paris Commune set fire to the unfinished palace, partially destroying it; but it was later restored and completed.\n\nPlace Dauphine\nThe triangular Place Dauphine, at the downstream end of the island, was originally the garden of the royal palace. Known as \"The King's Orchard\", it was filled with vegetable gardens, fruit trees and flower beds. Beginning in 1609 King Henry IV turned it into a residential square, facing the palace, similar to the square he began at the Place des Vosges a few years earlier. It was named for his son, the Dauphin of France (the future Louis XIII). He asked the president of the Parliament, Achille de Harlay to develop it. Twelve lots were sold, and forty-five irregularly sized houses were constructed behind a standardised façade. The houses were built of brick, with limestone quoins supported on arcaded stone ground floors and capped by steep slate roofs with dormers – similar to the façades of Place des Vosges. Each house had a ground floor of arcades occupied by shops; two floors of living space; and an attic with skylights.\n\nThe Pont Neuf and the Square du Vert Galant\nThe Pont Neuf, completed in 1606, was the first bridge in Paris to cross the entire length of the Seine, and the first that was not lined with houses. It was the project of Henry IV. After the assassination of the king in 1610, it became the site of another innovation: the first equestrian statue in Paris. Commissioned in 1614 by Marie de' Medici – the widow and regent of the king – it was modelled after the equestrian statues of her native Italy. Giambologna completed the commission in 1618. The statue was destroyed in 1792 during the French Revolution, but was replaced in 1817 by the royal sculptor François Lemot, using casts of the original.\n\nBridges\nFrom early times wooden bridges linked the island to the riverbanks on either side. The Grand Pont (or Pont au Change) spanned the wider reach to the Right Bank, while the Petit Pont crossed the narrower channel to the Left Bank. The first stone bridge was built in 1378 at the site of the present Pont Saint-Michel; but ice floes carried it away, along with all the houses on it, 1408. The Grand Pont or Pont Notre-Dame – also swept away at intervals by floodwaters – and the Petit Pont were rebuilt by Fra Giovanni Giocondo at the beginning of the 16th century. The six arches of the Pont Notre-Dame supported gabled houses, some of half-timbered construction, until all were demolished in 1786.\n\nTransport\nThe island has one Paris Métro station: Cité. There is also one RER station: Saint-Michel-Notre-Dame, although on the Left Bank, has an exit on the island in front of the cathedral.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Île_de_la_Cité\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nA Gallic settlement, called Lutetia, may have existed on the island since at least the 3rd century BC [4] The nearby area was inhabited by the Parisii, a small Gallic tribe The island may have served them as a convenient place to cross the Seine, a base for a flourishing trading network by river, and a place of refuge in times of invasion However, no significant traces of a settlement earlier than the 1st century AD have been found to date on the island [5]\n\n\nEarly history\nA Gallic settlement, called Lutetia, may have existed on the island since at least the 3rd century BC [4] The nearby area was inhabited by the Parisii, a small Gallic tribe The island may have served them as a convenient place to cross the Seine, a base for a flourishing trading network by river, and a place of refuge in times of invasion However, no significant traces of a settlement earlier than the 1st century AD have been found to date on the island [5]\n\n\n12th–17th century\nLouis IX built his new chapel, the jewel-like Sainte-Chapelle, between 1242 and 1248 [10] During the same period, the most famous landmark of the island was constructed: the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris An earlier cathedral, the Cathedral of Saint-Etienne, had been constructed in the Romanesque style In 1160, the bishop of Paris, Maurice de Sully, began construction of a cathedral in the new Gothic style, to match the magnificence of the palace The first stones of the foundation of the new cathedral were laid by Pope Alexander III, in 1163 Its construction spanned two centuries [11]\n\n\n18th century\nIn the 18th century, the Conciergerie on the island became the scene of some of the most dramatic events of the French Revolution In 1788, the Constituent Assembly, meeting in the former royal palace, refused the demands of Louis XVI to turn over some of its members In 1790, Jean Sylvain Baily, the mayor of Paris, sealed the doors of the royal palace In August 1793, Queen Marie-Antoinette was taken to the Conciergerie, where she was imprisoned After two and a half months she was tried, convicted, and sentenced to the guillotine In September 1793, the radical Sans-Culottes stormed the Conciergerie and massacred the remaining royalist prisoners On 27 July 1795, it was the turn of the revolutionary leader Robespierre to be arrested, brought to the Conciergerie, tried, and sent to the guillotine [13]\n\n\n19th–20th century\nIn the early 19th century, with the restoration of the monarchy, the old palace was substantially rebuilt for its function as the center of the judicial system An expiatory chapel was built where the cell of Marie-Antoinette had been Between 1820 and 1828, the façade between the Tower of the Horloge and the Tower of Bonbec was rebuilt It remained a prison;

[you need] a force that is of the side of God, of love .. almost like on the side of the angels .. as opposed to the demons.\" [3] In reflecting on the Capitol storming, Chansley said that \"What we did on January 6 in many ways was an evolution in consciousness, because as we marched down the street along these ley lines shouting 'USA' or shouting things like 'freedom'.. we were actually affecting the quantum realm.\" [27]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nAn animated Chansley appears in the 2021 \"South ParQ Vaccination Special\" episode of South Park, in which he becomes a home school tutor for \"Tutornon\" [82] [83] A character dressed in attire similar to Chansley's appears in a 2021 episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia titled \"2020: A Year In Review\", [84] as well as a 2021 episode of Reno 911!

Angeli has a social media presence and has attended rallies and events supporting QAnon and other conspiracy theories.\n\n## Role in Conspiratorial Movement\n\nJake Angeli has been a vocal supporter of QAnon, a conspiracy theory that posits the existence of a secret cabal of powerful individuals working to undermine the United States government and its institutions. He has also expressed support for other conspiracy theories, including the idea of \"ley lines\" and the notion that the United States government is controlled by a secret society of Freemasons. Angeli has attended rallies and events in support of these theories, often wearing his distinctive \"shamanic\" attire, which includes a bison-horned fur headdress and war paint in red, white, and blue.\n\n## Participation in the 2021 Capitol Attack\n\nOn January 6, 2021, Jake Angeli entered the United States Capitol building during the storming of the building by a mob of supporters of President Donald Trump.

In a January 14 court filing, federal prosecutors stated that Angeli had left a note on Pence's desk in the Senate chamber that said \"It's only a matter of time, justice is coming.\"\n\n## Disinformation about Affiliation and Role\n\nAfter the storming of the Capitol, pro-Trump users on social media circulated false rumors that Jake Angeli was not a supporter of President Trump or the right-wing movement, but was instead associated with the Black Lives Matter movement and had infiltrated the event as an agent provocateur. These claims were based on a photo of Angeli at a Black Lives Matter rally in Arizona, which was cropped to remove his \"Q Sent Me\" sign indicating that he was a counter-protester rather than a participant at the rally.\n\n## Views\n\nJake Angeli has expressed a range of conspiracy theories and beliefs, including the idea that televisions and radios emit \"specific frequencies that are inaudible\" that can affect brain waves. He has also spoken about the Bilderberg conspiracy theory and the idea of \"ley lines\" crisscrossing the United States. Angeli has stated that he believes that in order to defeat an \"evil occultic force,\" one needs a \"light occultic force,\" and that this can be achieved by aligning oneself with the forces of love and good. In reflecting on the Capitol storming, Angeli stated that \"What we did on January 6 in many ways was an evolution in consciousness, because as we marched down the street along these ley lines shouting 'USA' or shouting things like 'freedom'... we were actually affecting the quantum realm.\"\n\n## In Popular Culture\n\nJake Angeli has been referenced in several popular culture works, including an animated appearance in the 2021 \"South ParQ Vaccination Special\" episode of South Park, and a live-action appearance in a 2021 episode of Reno 911!.

Born on April 16, 1971, in Lake Jackson, Texas, she rose to fame in the late 1980s and became known as the \"Queen of Tejano Music.\" On March 31, 1995, Selena was tragically murdered by Yolanda Saldivar, her fan club president and close friend, in a shooting at a motel in Corpus Christi, Texas.\n\n**Background**\n\nSelena was born to Abraham Quintanilla Jr. and Marcella Ofelia Quintanilla. Her father, a musician, had been part of a band and had hoped to revive his music career through his children. At the age of nine, Selena began singing with her siblings, A.B. Quintanilla III and Suzette Quintanilla, in a band called Selena y Los Dinos. The family's music career was marked by hardship, including eviction from their home and bankruptcy. However, Abraham's determination to succeed led to the formation of the band, which eventually found success in the Tejano music scene.\n\n**The Selena Fan Club**\n\nIn the early 1990s, Selena's popularity led to the formation of a fan club, which was managed by Yolanda Saldivar. Saldivar had been a loyal fan of Selena's music and had started the fan club as a way to connect with other fans. However, as the fan club grew in size and popularity, Saldivar's relationship with Selena began to change. She became increasingly possessive and controlling, often using her position to exert influence over Selena's personal life.\n\n**Selena Etc. Boutiques**\n\nIn 1994, Selena opened two boutiques, Selena Etc., in Corpus Christi and San Antonio. The boutiques were designed to showcase Selena's fashion sense and provide a retail outlet for her fans. Saldivar was appointed as the manager of the boutiques, and Selena trusted her to run the businesses while she was touring the country. However, Saldivar's true intentions were far from altruistic, and she soon began to embezzle money from the boutiques, using forged checks to fund her own personal expenses.\n\n**Failed Attempts to Kill Selena**\n\nIn the months leading up to Selena's murder, Saldivar's behavior became increasingly erratic. She began to receive threatening phone calls and letters from angry fans who claimed to have paid their enrollment fees for the fan club but had not received the promised memorabilia. Meanwhile, at both of Selena's boutiques, employees noted an influx of unpaid or overdue bills arriving in the mail, which Saldivar could provide no plausible explanation for. On March 30, 1995, Selena contacted Leonard Wong about the perfume samples he had made for her, and told an employee at the boutique that she was expecting to fire Saldivar.\n\n**Murder**\n\nOn March 31, 1995, Selena left for Saldivar's motel room to pick up some perfume samples that had been stolen from her.

in January 1994, Saldívar became the manager of the boutiques In September 1994, Selena signed Saldívar as her registered agent in San Antonio [19] After being hired to run the boutiques, Saldívar moved from South San Antonio to Corpus Christi to be closer to Selena In an interview with Primer Impacto in 1995, Abraham said he personally \"always mistrusted Saldívar\", though the family never found anything odd about her behavior [15] Saldívar was authorized to write and cash checks, and had access to bank accounts associated with the fan club and boutiques [20]\n\n\nSelena and Saldívar's relationship\nSaldívar received \"tokens of affection from  [Selena]\", which she was not accustomed to [18] Her room was covered with Selena posters and pictures, burning votive candles and a library of Selena videotapes which she played to entertain guests During an interview with Saldívar in 1995, reporters from The Dallas Morning News said her devotion to Selena bordered on obsession [19] Saldívar told employees at Selena Etc she wanted to \"be like Selena\" [21] According to an unnamed former employee, she was \"possessive\" of her relationship with Selena, and tried to exert control by distancing the singer from the other employees Saldívar said her reason for doing so was to \"shield\" the singer from the \"petty issues\" of managing her boutiques [23] Along with the responsibility of running the boutiques, Saldívar accompanied Selena on trips and had keys to the singer's house [20]\n\n\nSaldívar's termination of employment\nStarting in January 1995, Abraham began receiving telephone calls and letters from angry fans who claimed to have paid their enrollment fees for the fan club, but had not received the promised memorabilia [33] Meanwhile, at both of Selena's boutiques in Corpus Christi and San Antonio, employees noted an influx of unpaid or overdue bills arriving in the mail, for which Saldívar could provide no plausible explanation [34] Upon investigation, Abraham discovered Saldívar had embezzled more than $60,000 using forged checks from both the fan club and the boutiques [35]\n\n\nFailed attempts to kill Selena\nThe day after Saldívar was banned from contacting Selena, Abraham drove to Q-Productions and chased her off the premises That same day, Selena and Saldívar argued by telephone [36] The singer and her husband were unsatisfied with Saldívar's explanation for why the items were unaccounted for [43]\n\n\nMurder\nOn March 30, 1995, Selena contacted Leonard Wong about the perfume samples he had made for her According to Wong, the singer told him she would be meeting Saldívar the next morning to pick up the samples that had been stolen from her [53] That same day, Selena told an employee at the boutique she was expecting to fire Saldívar [54] The employee followed Selena to her home that night because she was concerned over the singer after their discussion about Saldívar [55] At 7:30 a.m (CST) on March 31, Selena left for Saldívar's motel room [56] [nb 2]\n\n\nStandoff\nAfter the shooting, Saldívar entered her pickup truck and tried to leave the motel parking lot [69] Motel employee Rosario Garza saw her leave her room with a wrapped towel [68] [88] It was later thought she was going to Q-Productions to shoot Abraham and others who were waiting for Selena [89] However, she was spotted by a responding police officer in a patrol car The officer left his vehicle, drew his gun and ordered Saldívar out of the truck Saldívar did not comply;

Chechnya from the Chechen insurgents' point of view [f] [32]\n\n\nHistorical basis of the conflict\nChechnya is an area in the Northern Caucasus which has constantly fought against foreign rule, including the Ottoman Turks in the 15th century The Russian Terek Cossack Host was established in lowland Chechnya in 1577 by free Cossacks who were resettled from the Volga to the Terek River In 1783, the Russian Empire and the Georgian Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti signed the Treaty of Georgievsk, under which Kartli-Kakheti became a Russian protectorate [33] To secure communications with Georgia and other regions of the Transcaucasia, the Russian Empire began spreading its influence into the Caucasus region, starting the Caucasus War in 1817 Russian forces first moved into highland Chechnya in 1830, and the conflict in the area lasted until 1859, when a 250,000-strong army under General Aleksandr Baryatinsky broke down the highlanders' resistance Frequent uprisings in the Caucasus also occurred during the Russo–Turkish War of 1877–78.\n\n\nRussian Empire\nChechnya is an area in the Northern Caucasus which has constantly fought against foreign rule, including the Ottoman Turks in the

Russo–Turkish War of 1877–78.\n\n\nSoviet Union\nFollowing the Russian Revolution of 1917, Chechens established a short-lived Caucasian Imamate which included parts of Chechnya, Dagestan and Ingushetia; there was also the secular pan-Caucasian Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus [34] Most of the resistance was defeated by Bolshevik troops by 1922 Then, months before the creation of the Soviet Union, the Chechen Autonomous Oblast of the Russian SFSR was established It annexed a part of territory of the former Terek Cossack Host Chechnya and neighboring Ingushetia formed the Checheno–Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1936 In 1941, during World War II, a small-scale Chechen revolt broke out, led by Hasan Israilov In 1944, the entire Chechen people were deported to the Kazakh SSR and Kirghiz SSR in an act of ethnic cleansing; this was done under the false pretext of Chechen mass collaboration with Nazi Germany An estimated 1/4 to 1/3 of the Chechen population perished due the harsh conditions [35] [36] [37] Many scholars recognize the deportation as an act of genocide, as did the European Parliament in 2004 [38] [39] [40] In 1992 the separatist government built a memorial dedicated to the victims of the acts of 1944 The pro-Russian government would later demolish this memorial [41] [42] Tombstones which were an integral part of the memorial were found planted on the Akhmad Kadyrov Square next to granite steles honoring the losses of the local pro-Russian power [43]\n\n\nFirst Chechen War\nDuring the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, there was an anti-Soviet revolution in Chechnya, which ultimately led to Chechnya declaring independence In 1992, Chechen and Ingush leaders signed an agreement splitting the joint Checheno–Ingush republic in two, with Ingushetia joining the Russian Federation and Chechnya remaining independent The tension between Chechnya and Russia over independence ultimately led to Russian intervention in the republic, in which the Russians covertly tried to oust the government of Dzhokhar Dudayev The First Chechen War began in 1994, when Russian forces entered Chechnya on the premise of restoring constitutional order Following nearly two years of brutal fighting, with a death toll exceeding 100,000 by some estimates, the 1996 Khasavyurt ceasefire agreement was signed and Russian troops were withdrawn from the republic [44]\n\n\nPrelude to the Second Chechen War\nThe authority of the government in Grozny was opposed by extremist warlords like Arbi Barayev, who according to some sources was in cooperation with the FSB [45] Kidnapping in Chechnya reached large proportions, and the total turnover reached tens of millions of dollars [46] In 1998, a group of four Western hostages was murdered Russian special services were accused of being involved in kidnappings [47] [better source needed] In 1998, a state of emergency was declared by the authorities in Grozny In July 1998 a confrontation occurred in Gudermes between Chechen National Guard troops and a fundamentalist faction leading to many casualties [48]\n\n\nInstability in Chechnya\nThe authority of the government in Grozny was opposed by extremist warlords like Arbi Barayev, who according to some sources was in cooperation with the FSB [45] Kidnapping in Chechnya reached large proportions, and the

fundamentalist faction leading to many casualties [48]\n\n\nRussian–Chechen relations (1996–1999)\nPolitical tensions were fueled in part by allegedly Chechen or pro-Chechen terrorist and criminal activity in Russia, as well as by border clashes On 16 November 1996, in Kaspiysk (Dagestan), a bomb destroyed an apartment building housing Russian border guards, killing 68 people The cause of the blast was never determined, but many in Russia blamed Chechen separatists [52] Three people died on 23 April 1997, when a bomb exploded in the Russian railway station of Armavir (Krasnodar Krai), and two on 28 May 1997, when another bomb exploded in the Russian railway station of Pyatigorsk (Stavropol Krai) On 22 December 1997, forces of Dagestani militants and Chechnya-based Arab warlord Ibn al-Khattab raided the base of the 136th Motor Rifle Brigade of the Russian Army in Buynaksk, Dagestan, inflicting heavy casualties [53]\n\n\nDagestan\nOn 7 August 1999, Shamil Basayev together with Ibn al-Khattab, led two groups of up to 2,000 Chechen, Dagestani, Arab mujahideen from Chechnya into the neighboring Republic of Dagestan This war saw the first (unconfirmed) use of aerial-delivered fuel air explosives (FAE) in mountainous areas, notably in the village of Tando [64] By mid-September 1999, the militants were routed from the villages they had captured and retreated back into Chechnya According to Russia several hundred militants were killed in the fighting and the Russian side reported 275 servicemen killed and approximately 900 wounded [65]\n\n\nRussian apartment bombings\nBefore the wake of the Dagestani campaign had settled, a series of bombings took place in Russia (in Moscow and in Volgodonsk) and in the Dagestani town of Buynaksk On 4 September 1999, 62 people died in an apartment building housing members of families of Russian soldiers Over the next two weeks, the bombs targeted three other apartment buildings and a mall; in total over 350 people were killed The then Prime Minister Putin quickly blamed the attacks on Chechen militants and despite no evidence linking the bombings to Chechens; ordered the bombing campaign of Chechnya [66] In February 2000, the US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright stated they had not seen any evidence that tied the bombings to Chechnya [66]\n\n\n1999–2000 Russian offensive\nIn late August and early September 1999, Russia mounted a massive aerial campaign over Chechnya, with the stated aim of wiping out militants who invaded Dagestan earlier in the same month On 26 August 1999, Russia acknowledged bombing raids in Chechnya [75] The Russian air strikes were reported to have forced at least 100,000 Chechens to flee their homes to safety; the neighbouring region of Ingushetia was reported to have appealed for United Nations aid to deal with tens of thousands of refugees [76] On 2 October 1999, Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations reported that 78,000 people had fled the air strikes in Chechnya; most of them went to Ingushetia, where they arrived at a rate of 5,000 to 6,000 a day [citation needed]\n\n\nAir war\nIn late August and early September 1999, Russia mounted a

Ingushetia, where they arrived at a rate of 5,000 to 6,000 a day [citation needed]\n\n\nLand war\nThe Chechen conflict entered a new phase on 1 October 1999, when Russia's new Prime Minister Vladimir Putin declared the authority of Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov and his parliament illegitimate [citation needed] At this time, Putin announced that Russian troops would initiate a land war but progress only as far as the Terek River, which cuts the northern third of Chechnya off from the rest of the republic Putin's stated intention was to take control of Chechnya's northern plain and establish a cordon sanitaire against further Chechen aggression; he later recalled that the cordon alone was \"pointless and technically impossible,\" apparently because of Chechnya's rugged terrain According to Russian accounts, Putin accelerated a plan for a major crackdown against Chechnya that had been drawn up months earlier [77]\n\n\nSiege of Grozny\nThe Russian assault on Grozny began in early December, accompanied by a struggle for neighbouring settlements The battle ended when the Russian army seized the city on 2 February 2000 According to official Russian figures, at least 134 federal troops and an unknown number of pro-Russian militiamen died in Grozny The separatist forces also suffered heavy losses, including losing several top commanders Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said that 1,500 separatists were killed trying to leave Grozny The separatists said they lost at least 500 fighters in the mine field at Alkhan-Kala [88] The siege and fighting devastated the capital like no other European city since World War II In 2003, the United Nations called Grozny the most destroyed city on Earth [89] The Russians also suffered heavy losses as they advanced elsewhere, and from Chechen counterattacks and convoy ambushes On 26 January 2000, the Russian government announced that 1,173 servicemen had been killed in Chechnya since October, [90] more than double the 544 killed reported just 19 days earlier [91]\n\n\nBattle for the mountains\nHeavy fighting accompanied by massive shelling and bombing continued through the winter of 2000 in the mountainous south of Chechnya, particularly in the areas around Argun, Vedeno and Shatoy, where fighting involving Russian paratroopers had raged since 1999 [citation needed]\n\n\nRestoration of federal government\nIn May 2000 the following month, Putin appointed Akhmad Kadyrov interim head of the pro-Moscow government This development met with early approval in the rest of Russia, but the continued deaths of Russian troops dampened public enthusiasm On 23 March 2003, a new Chechen constitution was passed in a referendum The 2003 Constitution granted the Chechen Republic a significant degree of autonomy, but still tied it firmly to Russia and Moscow's rule, and went into force on 2 April 2003 The referendum was strongly supported by the Russian government but met a harsh critical response from Chechen separatists; many citizens chose to boycott the ballot  [citation needed] Akhmad Kadyrov was assassinated by a bomb blast in 2004 Since December 2005, his son Ramzan Kadyrov, leader of the pro-Moscow militia known as kadyrovtsy, has been functioning as the Chechnya's de facto ruler Kadyrov has become Chechnya's most powerful leader and, in February 2007, with support from Putin, Ramzan Kadyrov replaced Alu Alkhanov as president.\n\n\nInsurgency\nAlthough large-scale fighting within Chechnya had ceased, daily attacks continued, particularly in the southern portions of Chechnya and spilling into nearby territories of the Caucasus, especially after the Caucasus Front was established Typically small separatist units targeted Russian and pro-Russian officials, security forces, and military and police convoys and vehicles The separatist units employed IEDs and sometimes combined for larger raids Russian forces retaliated with artillery and air strikes, as well as counter-insurgency operations Most soldiers in Chechnya were kontraktniki (contract soldiers) as opposed to the earlier conscripts While Russia continued to maintain a military presence within Chechnya, federal forces played less of a direct role Pro-Kremlin Chechen forces under the command of the local strongman Ramzan Kadyrov, known as the kadyrovtsy, dominated law enforcement and security operations, with many members (including Kadyrov himself) being former Chechen separatists who had defected since 1999 Since 2004, the Kadyrovtsy were partly incorporated into two Interior Ministry units, North and South (Sever and Yug) Two other units of the Chechen pro-Moscow forces, East and West (Vostok and Zapad), were commanded by Sulim Yamadayev (Vostok) and Said-Magomed Kakiyev (Zapad) and their men [97]\n\n\nGuerrilla war in Chechnya\nAlthough large-scale fighting within Chechnya had ceased, daily attacks continued, particularly in the southern portions of Chechnya and spilling into nearby territories of the Caucasus, especially after the Caucasus Front was established Typically small separatist units targeted Russian and pro-Russian officials, security forces, and military and police convoys and vehicles The separatist units employed IEDs and sometimes combined for larger raids Russian forces retaliated with artillery and air strikes, as well as counter-insurgency operations Most soldiers in Chechnya were kontraktniki (contract soldiers) as opposed to the earlier conscripts While Russia continued to maintain a military presence within

(Zapad) and their men [97]\n\n\nSuicide attacks\nBetween June 2000 and September 2004, Chechen insurgents added suicide attacks to their tactics During this period, there were 23 Chechen-related suicide attacks in and outside Chechnya, notably the hostage taking at an elementary school in Beslan, in which at least 334 people died.\n\n\nAssassinations\nBoth sides of the war carried out multiple assassinations The most prominent of these included the 13 February 2004 killing of exiled former separatist Chechen President Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev in Qatar, and the 9 May 2004 killing of pro-Russian Chechen President Akhmad Kadyrov during a parade in Grozny.\n\n\nCaucasus Front\nWhile anti-Russian local insurgencies in the North Caucasus started even before the war, in May 2005, two months after Maskahdov's death, Chechen separatists officially announced that they had formed a Caucasus Front within the framework of \"reforming the system of military–political power.\" Along with the Chechen, Dagestani and Ingush \"sectors,\" the Stavropol, Kabardin-Balkar, Krasnodar, Karachai-Circassian, Ossetian and Adyghe jamaats were included This meant that practically all the regions of Russia's south were involved in the hostilities.\n\n\nHuman rights and terrorism\nThe Second Chechen War saw a new wave of war crimes and violation of international humanitarian law Both sides have been criticised by international organizations of violating the Geneva Conventions However, a report by Human Rights Watch states that without minimizing the abuses committed by Chechen fighters, the main reason for civilian suffering in the Second Chechen War came as a result of the abuses committed by the Russian forces on the civilian population [100]  According to Amnesty International, Chechen civilians have been purposely targeted by Russian forces, in apparent disregard of humanitarian law The situation has been described by Amnesty International as a Russian campaign to punish an entire ethnic group, on the pretext of \"fighting crime and terrorism\" [101] Russian forces have throughout the campaign ignored to follow their Geneva convention obligations, and has taken little responsibility of protecting the civilian population [100] Amnesty International stated in their 2001 report that Chechen civilians, including medical personnel, have been the target of military attacks by Russian forces, and hundreds of Chechen civilians and prisoners of war are extrajudicially executed [102]\n\n\nHuman rights and war crimes\nThe Second Chechen War saw a new wave of war crimes and violation of international humanitarian law Both sides have been criticised by international organizations of violating the Geneva Conventions However, a report by Human Rights Watch states that without minimizing the abuses committed by Chechen fighters, the main reason for civilian suffering in the Second Chechen War came as a result of the abuses committed by the Russian forces on the civilian population [100]  According to Amnesty International, Chechen civilians have been purposely targeted by Russian forces, in apparent disregard of humanitarian law The situation has been

including medical personnel, have been the target of military attacks by Russian forces, and hundreds of Chechen civilians and prisoners of war are extrajudicially executed [102]\n\n\nTerrorist attacks\nBetween May 2002 and September 2004, the Chechen and Chechen-led militants, mostly answering to Shamil Basayev, launched a campaign of terrorism directed against civilian targets in Russia About 200 people were killed in a series of bombings (most of them suicide attacks), most of them in the 2003 Stavropol train bombing (46), the 2004 Moscow metro bombing (40), and the 2004 Russian aircraft bombings (89) Two big kidnaps, the 2002 Moscow theater hostage crisis and the Beslan school hostage crisis in 2004, resulted in the deaths of many civilians In the Moscow stand-off, FSB Spetsnaz forces stormed the building on the third day using an unknown incapacitating chemical agent that proved to be lethal without sufficient medical care, resulting in deaths of 133 out of 916 hostages In Beslan, some 20 hostages had been murdered by their captors before the assault, and the ill-prepared assault (started hastily after explosions in the gym that had been rigged with explosives by the terrorists) resulted in 294 more casualties among the 1,128 hostages, as well as many losses among the special forces.\n\n\nOther issues\nRussian officials have accused the bordering republic of Georgia of allowing Chechen separatists to operate on Georgian territory and permitting the flow of militants and materiel across the Georgian border with Russia In February 2002, the United States began offering assistance to Georgia in combating \"criminal elements\" as well as alleged Arab mujahideen activity in Pankisi Gorge as part of the War on Terrorism Without resistance, Georgian troops have detained an Arab man and six criminals, and declared the region under control [149] In August 2002, Georgia accused Russia of a series of secret air strikes on purported separatists havens in the Pankisi Gorge in which a Georgian civilian was reported killed.\n\n\nGeorgian Pankisi crisis\nRussian officials have accused the bordering republic of Georgia of allowing Chechen separatists to operate on Georgian territory and permitting the flow of militants and materiel across the Georgian border with Russia In February 2002, the United States began offering assistance to Georgia in combating \"criminal elements\" as well as alleged Arab mujahideen activity in Pankisi Gorge as part of the War on Terrorism Without resistance, Georgian troops have detained an Arab man and six criminals, and declared the region under control [149] In August 2002, Georgia accused Russia of a series of secret air strikes on purported separatists havens in the Pankisi Gorge in which a Georgian civilian was reported killed.\n\n\nUnilateral ceasefire of 2005\nOn 2 February 2005, Chechen separatist president Aslan Maskhadov issued a call for a ceasefire lasting until at least 22 February (the day preceding the anniversary of Stalin's deportation of the Chechen population) The call was issued through a separatist website and addressed to President Putin, described as a gesture of goodwill On 8 March 2005, Maskhadov was killed in an operation by Russian security forces in the Chechen community of Tolstoy-Yurt, northeast of Grozny.\n\n\nAmnesties\nAs of November 2007, there were at least seven amnesties for separatist militants, as well as federal servicemen who committed crimes, declared in Chechnya by Moscow since the start of the second war The first one was announced in 1999 when about 400 Chechen switched sides (However, according to Putin's advisor and aide Aslambek Aslakhanov most of them were since killed, both by their former comrades and by the Russians, who by then perceived them as a potential \"fifth column\" [152]) Some of the other amnesties included one during September 2003 in connection with the adoption of the republic's new constitution, and then another between mid-2006 and January 2007 [citation needed] In 2007, the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights published a report entitled Amnestied People as Targets for Persecution in Chechnya, which documents the fate of several persons who have been amnestied and subsequently abducted, tortured and killed.\n\n\nGovernment censorship of the media coverage\nThe first war, with its extensive and largely unrestricted coverage (despite deaths of many journalists), convinced the Kremlin more than any other event that it needed to control national television channels, which most Russians rely on for news, to undertake any major national policy By the time the second war began, federal authorities had designed and introduced a comprehensive system to limit the access of journalists to Chechnya and shape their coverage [153]\n\n\nEffects\nIn the Second Chechen War, over 60,000 combatants and non-combatants were killed [159] Civilian casualty estimates vary widely According to the pro-Moscow Chechnya government, 160,000 combatants and non-combatants died or have gone missing in the two wars, including 30,000–40,000 Chechens and about 100,000 Russians, [160] [161] while separatist leader Aslan Maskhadov (deceased) repeatedly claimed about 200,000 ethnic Chechens died as a consequence of the two conflicts [162] As in the case of military losses, these claims can not be independently verified According to a count by the Russian human rights group Memorial in 2007, up to 25,000 civilians have died or disappeared since 1999 [163] According to Amnesty International in 2007, the second war killed up to 25,000 civilians since 1999, with up to another 5,000 people missing [25] However, the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society set their estimate of the total death toll in two wars at about 150,000 to 200,000 civilians [164]\n\n\nCivilian losses\nIn the Second Chechen War, over 60,000 combatants and non-combatants were killed [159] Civilian casualty estimates vary widely According to the pro-Moscow Chechnya government, 160,000 combatants and non-combatants died or have gone missing in the two wars, including 30,000–40,000 Chechens and about 100,000 Russians, [160] [161] while separatist leader Aslan Maskhadov (deceased) repeatedly claimed about 200,000 ethnic Chechens died as a consequence of the two conflicts [162] As in the case of military losses, these claims can not be independently verified According to a count by the Russian human rights group Memorial in 2007, up to 25,000 civilians have died or disappeared since 1999 [163] According to Amnesty International in 2007, the second war killed up to 25,000 civilians since 1999, with up to another 5,000 people missing [25] However, the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society set their estimate of the total death toll in two wars at about 150,000 to 200,000 civilians [164]\n\n\nEnvironmental damage\nEnvironmental agencies warn that the Russian republic of Chechnya, devastated by war, now faces ecological disaster A former aide to Boris Yeltsin believes Russian bombing has rendered Chechnya an \"environmental wasteland.\" [165] There is a special concern over widespread oil spills and pollution from sewers damaged by war (the water is polluted to a depth of 250 m [166]), and chemical and radioactive pollution, as a result of the bombardment of chemical facilities and storages during the conflict [167] Chechnya's wildlife also sustained heavy damage during the hostilities, as animals that had once populated the Chechen forests have moved off to seek safer ground [168] In 2004, Russian government has designated one-third of Chechnya a \"zone of ecological disaster\" and another 40% \"a zone of extreme environmental distress\" [169]\n\n\nLand mines\nChechnya is the most land mine-affected region worldwide [170] Since 1994 there have been widespread use of mines by both sides (Russia is a party to the 1980 Convention on Conventional Weapons but not the 1996 protocol on land mines and other devices) The most heavily mined areas of Chechnya are those in which separatists continued to put up resistance, namely the southern regions, as well as the borders of the republic [171] No humanitarian mine clearance has taken place since the HALO Trust was evicted by Russia in December 1999 In June 2002, Olara Otunnu, the UN official, estimated that there were 500,000 land mines placed in the region UNICEF has recorded 2,340 civilian land mine and unexploded ordnance casualties occurring in Chechnya between 1999 and the end of 2003.\n\n\nMilitary losses\nMilitary casualty figures from both sides are impossible to verify and are generally believed to be higher In September 2000, the Kavkaz Center compiled a list of casualties officially announced in the conflict, which, although incomplete and with little factual value, provide some minimal insight of the casualties [172] According to the figures released by the Russian Ministry of Defence in August 2005, at least 1,250 Russian Armed Forces soldiers were killed in action in 1999–2005 This death toll did not include losses of Internal Troops, the FSB, police and local paramilitaries, of whom all at least 1,720 were killed by October 2003 [164] Independent Russian and Western estimates are much higher; the Union of the Committees of Soldiers' Mothers of Russia, for instance, estimated about 2,000 Russian Army servicemen have been killed between 1999 and 2003 [163]\n\n\nPolitical radicalization of the separatist movement\nThe Chechens had become increasingly radicalized Former Soviet Armed Forces officers Dzhokhar Dudayev and Aslan Maskhadov were succeeded by people who rely more on Islamist doctrine, rather than the secular nationalistic feelings of the population While Dudayev and Maskhadov were seeking from Moscow recognition of the independence of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, other leaders spoke out more about the need to expel Russia from the territory of the whole North Caucasus, an impoverished mountain region inhabited mostly by Muslim, non-Russian ethnic groups [citation needed]\n\n\nImpact on the Chechen population\nAccording to a 2006 report by Médecins Sans Frontières, \"the majority of Chechens still struggle through lives burdened by fear, uncertainty and poverty.\" A survey conducted by MSF in September 2005 showed that 77% of the respondents were suffering from \"discernible symptoms of psychological distress\" [179]\n\n\nImpact on the Russian population\nThe start of the war bolstered the domestic popularity of Vladimir Putin as the campaign was started one month after he had become Russian prime minister [158] The conflict greatly contributed to the deep changes in the Russian politics and society [192]\n\n\nStatus\nIn 2005, there were about 60,000 Federal troops in Chechnya, but that number has since decreased significantly Tony Wood, a journalist and author who has written extensively about Chechnya, estimated there were about 8,000 local security forces remaining in the region as of 2007 [update] Independent analysts say there are no more than 2,000 armed terrorists combatants still fighting, while Russia says only a few hundred remain There is still some sporadic fighting in the mountains and south of the republic, but Russia has scaled down its presence significantly leaving the local government to stabilize things further [163]  In February 2008 the President of the separatist Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, Dokka Umarov, spoke of \"thousands of fighters\" when he addressed a speech to all his fighters in the mountains [203]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nPublications\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "The Second Chechen War, also known as the Second Chechen Campaign or the Second Russian Invasion of Chechnya, was a military conflict fought between the Russian Federation and the Chechen separatists, who sought to establish an independent Chechen state. The conflict began in 1999 and lasted for several years, causing significant human suffering and damage to the region.\n\n## Historical basis of the conflict\n\nChechnya has a long history of fighting against foreign rule, dating back to the 15th century when the Ottoman Turks invaded the region. The Russian Terek Cossack Host was established in lowland Chechnya in 1577, and the Russian Empire began to spread its influence into the Caucasus region in the early 19th century. The Caucasus War, which lasted from 1817 to 1864, saw the Russian Empire establish control over the region, including Chechnya.\n\n## Russian Empire\n\nDuring the Russian Empire, Chechnya was a major battleground between the Russian authorities and the local population, who resisted the Russian rule. The conflict in the Caucasus region was a major drain on the Russian Empire's resources, and it was not until the late 19th century that the Russian authorities were able to establish a semblance of control over the region.\n\n## Soviet Union\n\nFollowing the Russian Revolution of 1917, Chechens established a short-lived Caucasian Imamate, which included parts of Chechnya, Dagestan, and Ingushetia. The Soviet Union was established in 1922, and the Chechen Autonomous Oblast was established in the Russian SFSR. In 1936, the Checheno-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was formed, which included both Chechnya and Ingushetia.\n\n## First Chechen War\n\nDuring the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Chechnya declared independence, and a conflict broke out between the Chechen separatists and the Russian authorities. The First Chechen War lasted from 1994 to 1996, with the Russian authorities ultimately withdrawing their troops from the region.\n\n## Prelude to the Second Chechen War\n\nIn the late 1990s, tensions between Russia and Chechnya began to escalate, with the Chechen separatists launching a series of attacks on Russian targets. In 1998, a group of four Western hostages was murdered in Chechnya, and the Russian authorities accused the Chechen separatists of being involved in the kidnapping.\n\n## Dagestan\n\nIn August 1999, a group of Chechen and Dagestani fighters, led by Shamil Basayev and Ibn al-Khattab, launched a series of attacks on Russian targets in Dagestan, a neighboring republic of Russia. The Russian authorities responded by launching a military campaign against the separatists, which led to the outbreak of the Second Chechen War.\n\n## Russian apartment bombings\n\nIn September 1999, a series of bombings took place in Russia, in which over 300 people were killed. The Russian authorities blamed the bombings on Chechen separatists, and used the bombings as a pretext for launching a military campaign against Chechnya.\n\n## 1999-2000 Russian offensive\n\nIn late August and early September 1999, Russia mounted a massive aerial campaign over Chechnya, with the stated aim of wiping out militants who invaded Dagestan earlier in the same month. The Russian air strikes forced at least 100,000 Chechens to flee their homes, with many taking refuge in neighboring Ingushetia.\n\n## Siege of Grozny\n\nIn early December 1999, the Russian assault on Grozny began, accompanied by a struggle for neighboring settlements. The battle ended when the Russian army seized the city on 2 February 2000. According to official Russian figures, at least 134 federal troops and an unknown number of pro-Russian militiamen died in Grozny.\n\n## Battle for the mountains\n\nHeavy fighting accompanied by massive shelling and bombing continued through the winter of 2000 in the mountainous south of Chechnya, particularly in the areas around Argun, Vedeno, and Shatoy.\n\n## Restoration of federal government\n\nIn May 2000, Putin appointed Akhmad Kadyrov interim head of the pro-Moscow government. The new government was recognized by the Russian authorities, and Kadyrov was tasked with establishing a semblance of order in the region.\n\n## Insurgency\n\nAlthough large-scale fighting within Chechnya had ceased, daily attacks continued, particularly in the southern portions of Chechnya and spilling into nearby territories of the Caucasus. Small separatist units targeted Russian and pro-Russian officials, security forces, and military and police convoys and vehicles.\n\n## Human rights and terrorism\n\nThe Second Chechen War saw a new wave of war crimes and violation of international humanitarian law. Both sides have been criticized by international organizations of violating the Geneva Conventions.\n\n## Unilateral ceasefire of 2005\n\nOn 2 February 2005, Chechen separatist president Aslan Maskhadov issued a call for a ceasefire lasting until at least 22 February. The call was part of a broader effort to establish a ceasefire and negotiate a settlement to the conflict.\n\n## Amnesties\n\nAs of November 2007, there were at least seven amnesties for separatist militants, as well as federal servicemen who committed crimes, declared in Chechnya by Moscow since the start of the second war.\n\n## Government censorship of the media coverage\n\nThe Russian authorities have implemented a comprehensive system to limit the access of journalists to Chechnya and shape their coverage of the conflict.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Second Chechen War was a devastating conflict that caused significant human suffering and damage to the region. The conflict has had a profound impact on the people of Chechnya, and has left deep scars on the region. The war has also had significant consequences for the Russian Federation, and has contributed to the erosion of trust between the Russian government and the people of Chechnya.\n\n## See also\n\n*

point of view [f] [32]\n\n\nHistorical basis of the conflict\nChechnya is an area in the Northern Caucasus which has constantly fought against foreign rule, including the Ottoman Turks in the 15th century The Russian Terek Cossack Host was established in lowland Chechnya in 1577 by free Cossacks who were resettled from the Volga to the Terek River In 1783, the Russian Empire and the Georgian Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti signed the Treaty of Georgievsk, under which Kartli-Kakheti became a Russian protectorate [33] To secure communications with Georgia and other regions of the Transcaucasia, the Russian Empire began spreading its influence into the Caucasus region, starting the Caucasus War in 1817 Russian forces first moved into highland Chechnya in 1830, and the conflict in the area lasted until 1859, when a 250,000-strong army under General Aleksandr Baryatinsky broke down the highlanders' resistance Frequent uprisings in the Caucasus also occurred during the Russo–Turkish War of 1877–78.\n\n\nRussian Empire\nChechnya is an area in the Northern Caucasus which has constantly fought against foreign rule, including the Ottoman Turks in the 15th century The Russian Terek

Union\nFollowing the Russian Revolution of 1917, Chechens established a short-lived Caucasian Imamate which included parts of Chechnya, Dagestan and Ingushetia; there was also the secular pan-Caucasian Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus [34] Most of the resistance was defeated by Bolshevik troops by 1922 Then, months before the creation of the Soviet Union, the Chechen Autonomous Oblast of the Russian SFSR was established It annexed a part of territory of the former Terek Cossack Host Chechnya and neighboring Ingushetia formed the Checheno–Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1936 In 1941, during World War II, a small-scale Chechen revolt broke out, led by Hasan Israilov In 1944, the entire Chechen people were deported to the Kazakh SSR and Kirghiz SSR in an act of ethnic cleansing; this was done under the false pretext of Chechen mass collaboration with Nazi Germany An estimated 1/4 to 1/3 of the Chechen population perished due the harsh conditions [35] [36] [37] Many scholars recognize the deportation as an act of genocide, as did the European Parliament in 2004 [38] [39] [40] In 1992 the separatist government built a memorial dedicated to the victims of the acts of 1944 The pro-Russian government would later demolish this memorial [41] [42] Tombstones which were an integral part of the memorial were found planted on the Akhmad Kadyrov Square next to granite steles honoring the losses of the local pro-Russian power [43]\n\n\nFirst Chechen War\nDuring the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, there was an anti-Soviet revolution in Chechnya, which ultimately led to Chechnya declaring independence In 1992, Chechen and Ingush leaders signed an agreement splitting the joint Checheno–Ingush republic in two, with Ingushetia joining the Russian Federation and Chechnya remaining independent The tension between Chechnya and Russia over independence ultimately led to Russian intervention in the republic, in which the Russians covertly tried to oust the government of Dzhokhar Dudayev The First Chechen War began in 1994, when Russian forces entered Chechnya on the premise of restoring constitutional order Following nearly two years of brutal fighting, with a death toll exceeding 100,000 by some estimates, the 1996 Khasavyurt ceasefire agreement was signed and Russian troops were withdrawn from the republic [44]\n\n\nPrelude to the Second Chechen War\nThe authority of the government in Grozny was opposed by extremist warlords like Arbi Barayev, who according to some sources was in cooperation with the FSB [45] Kidnapping in Chechnya reached large proportions, and the total turnover reached tens of millions of dollars [46] In 1998, a group of four Western hostages was murdered Russian special services were accused of being involved in kidnappings [47] [better source needed] In 1998, a state of emergency was declared by the authorities in Grozny In July 1998 a confrontation occurred in Gudermes between Chechen National Guard troops and a fundamentalist faction leading to many casualties [48]\n\n\nInstability in Chechnya\nThe authority of the government in Grozny was opposed by extremist warlords like Arbi Barayev, who according to some sources was in cooperation with the FSB [45] Kidnapping in Chechnya reached large proportions, and the total turnover reached tens of millions of dollars [46] In 1998, a group of four Western hostages was murdered Russian special services were accused of being involved in kidnappings [47] [better source needed] In 1998, a state of emergency was declared by the authorities in Grozny In July 1998 a confrontation occurred in Gudermes between Chechen National Guard troops and a fundamentalist faction leading to many casualties [48]\n\n\nRussian–Chechen relations (1996–1999)\nPolitical tensions were fueled in part by allegedly Chechen or pro-Chechen terrorist and criminal activity in Russia, as well as by border clashes On 16 November 1996, in Kaspiysk (Dagestan), a bomb destroyed an apartment building housing Russian border guards, killing 68 people The cause of the blast was never determined, but many in Russia blamed Chechen separatists [52] Three people died on 23 April 1997, when a bomb exploded in the Russian railway station of Armavir (Krasnodar Krai), and two on 28 May 1997, when another bomb exploded in the Russian railway station of Pyatigorsk (Stavropol Krai) On 22 December 1997, forces of Dagestani militants and Chechnya-based Arab warlord Ibn al-Khattab raided the base of the 136th Motor Rifle Brigade of the Russian Army in Buynaksk, Dagestan, inflicting heavy casualties [53]\n\n\nDagestan\nOn 7 August 1999, Shamil Basayev together with Ibn al-Khattab, led two groups of up to 2,000 Chechen, Dagestani, Arab mujahideen from Chechnya into the neighboring Republic of Dagestan This war saw the first (unconfirmed) use of aerial-delivered fuel air explosives (FAE) in mountainous areas, notably in the village of Tando [64] By mid-September 1999, the militants were routed from the villages they had captured and retreated back into Chechnya According to Russia several hundred militants were killed in the fighting and the Russian side reported 275 servicemen killed and approximately 900 wounded [65]\n\n\nRussian apartment bombings\nBefore the wake of the Dagestani campaign had settled, a series of bombings took place in Russia (in Moscow and in Volgodonsk) and in the Dagestani town of Buynaksk On 4 September 1999, 62 people died in an apartment building housing members of families of Russian soldiers Over the next two weeks, the bombs targeted three other apartment buildings and a mall; in total over 350 people were killed The then Prime Minister Putin quickly blamed the attacks on Chechen militants and despite no evidence linking the bombings to Chechens; ordered the bombing campaign of Chechnya [66] In February 2000, the US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright stated they had not seen any evidence that tied the bombings to Chechnya [66]\n\n\n1999–2000 Russian offensive\nIn late August and early September 1999, Russia mounted a massive aerial campaign over Chechnya, with the stated aim of wiping out militants who invaded Dagestan earlier in the same month On 26 August 1999, Russia acknowledged bombing raids in Chechnya [75] The Russian air strikes were reported to have forced at least 100,000 Chechens to flee their homes to safety; the neighbouring region of Ingushetia was reported to have appealed for United Nations aid to deal with tens of thousands of refugees [76] On 2 October 1999, Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations reported that 78,000 people had fled the air strikes in Chechnya; most of them went to Ingushetia, where they arrived at a rate of 5,000 to 6,000 a day [citation needed]\n\n\nAir war\nIn late August and early September 1999, Russia mounted a massive aerial campaign over Chechnya, with the stated aim of wiping out

[citation needed]\n\n\nLand war\nThe Chechen conflict entered a new phase on 1 October 1999, when Russia's new Prime Minister Vladimir Putin declared the authority of Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov and his parliament illegitimate [citation needed] At this time, Putin announced that Russian troops would initiate a land war but progress only as far as the Terek River, which cuts the northern third of Chechnya off from the rest of the republic Putin's stated intention was to take control of Chechnya's northern plain and establish a cordon sanitaire against further Chechen aggression; he later recalled that the cordon alone was \"pointless and technically impossible,\" apparently because of Chechnya's rugged terrain According to Russian accounts, Putin accelerated a plan for a major crackdown against Chechnya that had been drawn up months earlier [77]\n\n\nSiege of Grozny\nThe Russian assault on Grozny began in early December, accompanied by a struggle for neighbouring settlements The battle ended when the Russian army seized the city on 2 February 2000 According to official Russian figures, at least 134 federal troops and an unknown number of pro-Russian militiamen died in Grozny The separatist forces also suffered heavy losses, including losing several top commanders Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said that 1,500 separatists were killed trying to leave Grozny The separatists said they lost at least 500 fighters in the mine field at Alkhan-Kala [88] The siege and fighting devastated the capital like no other European city since World War II In 2003, the United Nations called Grozny the most destroyed city on Earth [89] The Russians also suffered heavy losses as they advanced elsewhere, and from Chechen counterattacks and convoy ambushes On 26 January 2000, the Russian government announced that 1,173 servicemen had been killed in Chechnya since October, [90] more than double the 544 killed reported just 19 days earlier [91]\n\n\nBattle for the mountains\nHeavy fighting accompanied by massive shelling and bombing continued through the winter of 2000 in the mountainous south of Chechnya, particularly in the areas around Argun, Vedeno and Shatoy, where fighting involving Russian paratroopers had raged since 1999 [citation needed]\n\n\nRestoration of federal government\nIn May 2000 the following month, Putin appointed Akhmad Kadyrov interim head of the pro-Moscow government This development met with early approval in the rest of Russia, but the continued deaths of Russian troops dampened public enthusiasm On 23 March 2003, a new Chechen constitution was passed in a referendum The 2003 Constitution granted the Chechen Republic a significant degree of autonomy, but still tied it firmly to Russia and Moscow's rule, and went into force on 2 April 2003 The referendum was strongly supported by the Russian government but met a harsh critical response from Chechen separatists; many citizens chose to boycott the ballot  [citation needed] Akhmad Kadyrov was assassinated by a bomb blast in 2004 Since December 2005, his son Ramzan Kadyrov, leader of the pro-Moscow militia known as kadyrovtsy, has been functioning as the Chechnya's de facto ruler Kadyrov has become Chechnya's most powerful leader and, in February 2007, with support from Putin, Ramzan Kadyrov replaced Alu Alkhanov as president.\n\n\nInsurgency\nAlthough large-scale fighting within Chechnya had ceased, daily attacks continued, particularly in the southern portions of Chechnya and spilling into nearby territories of the Caucasus, especially after the Caucasus Front was established Typically small separatist units targeted Russian and pro-Russian officials, security forces, and military and police convoys and vehicles The separatist units employed IEDs and sometimes combined for larger raids Russian forces retaliated with artillery and air strikes, as well as counter-insurgency operations Most soldiers in Chechnya were kontraktniki (contract soldiers) as opposed to the earlier conscripts While Russia continued to maintain a military presence within Chechnya, federal forces played less of a direct role Pro-Kremlin Chechen forces under the command of the local strongman Ramzan Kadyrov, known as the kadyrovtsy, dominated law enforcement and security operations, with many members (including Kadyrov himself) being former Chechen separatists who had defected since 1999 Since 2004, the Kadyrovtsy were partly incorporated into two Interior Ministry units, North and South (Sever and Yug) Two other units of the Chechen pro-Moscow forces, East and West (Vostok and Zapad), were commanded by Sulim Yamadayev (Vostok) and Said-Magomed Kakiyev (Zapad) and their men [97]\n\n\nGuerrilla war in Chechnya\nAlthough large-scale fighting within Chechnya had ceased, daily attacks continued, particularly in the southern portions of Chechnya and spilling into nearby territories of the Caucasus, especially after the Caucasus Front was established Typically small separatist units targeted Russian and pro-Russian officials, security forces, and military and police convoys and vehicles The

Chechen pro-Moscow forces, East and West (Vostok and Zapad), were commanded by Sulim Yamadayev (Vostok) and Said-Magomed Kakiyev (Zapad) and their men [97]\n\n\nSuicide attacks\nBetween June 2000 and September 2004, Chechen insurgents added suicide attacks to their tactics During this period, there were 23 Chechen-related suicide attacks in and outside Chechnya, notably the hostage taking at an elementary school in Beslan, in which at least 334 people died.\n\n\nAssassinations\nBoth sides of the war carried out multiple assassinations The most prominent of these included the 13 February 2004 killing of exiled former separatist Chechen President Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev in Qatar, and the 9 May 2004 killing of pro-Russian Chechen President Akhmad Kadyrov during a parade in Grozny.\n\n\nCaucasus Front\nWhile anti-Russian local insurgencies in the North Caucasus started even before the war, in May 2005, two months after Maskahdov's death, Chechen separatists officially announced that they had formed a Caucasus Front within the framework of \"reforming the system of military–political power.\" Along with the Chechen, Dagestani and Ingush \"sectors,\" the Stavropol, Kabardin-Balkar, Krasnodar, Karachai-Circassian, Ossetian and Adyghe jamaats were included This meant that practically all the regions of Russia's south were involved in the hostilities.\n\n\nHuman rights and terrorism\nThe Second Chechen War saw a new wave of war crimes and violation of international humanitarian law Both sides have been criticised by international organizations of violating the Geneva Conventions However, a report by Human Rights Watch states that without minimizing the abuses committed by Chechen fighters, the main reason for civilian suffering in the Second Chechen War came as a result of the abuses committed by the Russian forces on the civilian population [100]  According to Amnesty International, Chechen civilians have been purposely targeted by Russian forces, in apparent disregard of humanitarian law The situation has been described by Amnesty International as a Russian campaign to punish an entire ethnic group, on the pretext of \"fighting crime and terrorism\" [101] Russian forces have throughout the campaign ignored to follow their Geneva convention obligations, and has taken little responsibility of protecting the civilian population [100] Amnesty International stated in their 2001 report that Chechen civilians, including medical personnel, have been the target of military attacks by Russian forces, and hundreds of Chechen civilians and prisoners of war are extrajudicially executed [102]\n\n\nHuman rights and war crimes\nThe Second Chechen War saw a new wave of war crimes and violation of international humanitarian law Both sides have been criticised by international organizations of violating the Geneva Conventions However, a report by Human Rights Watch states that without minimizing the abuses committed by Chechen fighters, the main reason for civilian suffering in the Second Chechen War came as a result of the abuses committed by the Russian forces on the civilian population [100]  According to Amnesty International, Chechen civilians have been purposely targeted by Russian forces, in apparent disregard of humanitarian law The situation has been described by Amnesty International as a Russian campaign to punish an entire ethnic group, on the pretext of \"fighting crime and terrorism\" [101] Russian forces have throughout the campaign ignored to follow their Geneva convention obligations, and has taken little responsibility of protecting the civilian population [100] Amnesty International stated in their 2001 report that Chechen civilians, including medical personnel, have been the target of military attacks by Russian forces, and hundreds of Chechen civilians and prisoners of war are extrajudicially executed [102]\n\n\nTerrorist attacks\nBetween May 2002 and September 2004, the Chechen and Chechen-led militants, mostly answering to Shamil Basayev, launched a campaign of terrorism directed against civilian targets in Russia About 200 people were killed in a series of bombings (most of them suicide attacks), most of them in the 2003 Stavropol train bombing (46), the 2004 Moscow metro bombing (40), and the 2004 Russian aircraft bombings (89) Two big kidnaps, the 2002 Moscow theater hostage crisis and the Beslan school hostage crisis in 2004, resulted in the deaths of many civilians In the Moscow stand-off, FSB Spetsnaz forces stormed the building on the third day using an unknown incapacitating chemical agent that proved to be lethal without sufficient medical care, resulting in deaths of 133 out of 916 hostages In Beslan, some 20 hostages had been murdered by their captors before the assault, and the ill-prepared assault (started hastily after explosions in the gym that had been rigged with explosives by the terrorists) resulted in 294 more casualties among the 1,128 hostages, as well as many losses among the special forces.\n\n\nOther issues\nRussian officials have accused the bordering republic of Georgia of allowing Chechen separatists to operate on Georgian territory and permitting the flow of militants and materiel across the Georgian border with Russia In February 2002, the United States began offering assistance to Georgia in combating \"criminal elements\" as well as alleged Arab mujahideen activity in Pankisi Gorge as part of the War on Terrorism Without resistance, Georgian troops have detained an Arab man and six criminals, and declared the region under control [149] In August 2002, Georgia accused Russia of a series of secret air strikes on purported separatists havens in the Pankisi Gorge in which a Georgian civilian was reported killed.\n\n\nGeorgian Pankisi crisis\nRussian officials have accused the bordering republic of Georgia of allowing Chechen separatists to operate on Georgian territory and permitting the flow of militants and materiel across the Georgian border with Russia In February 2002, the United States began offering assistance to Georgia in combating \"criminal elements\" as well as alleged Arab mujahideen activity in Pankisi Gorge as part of the War on Terrorism Without resistance, Georgian troops have detained an Arab man and six criminals, and declared the region under control [149] In August 2002, Georgia accused Russia of a series of secret air strikes on purported separatists havens in the Pankisi Gorge in which a Georgian civilian was reported killed.\n\n\nUnilateral ceasefire of 2005\nOn 2 February 2005, Chechen separatist president Aslan Maskhadov issued a call for a ceasefire lasting until at least 22 February (the day preceding the anniversary of Stalin's deportation of the Chechen population) The call was issued through a separatist website and addressed to President Putin, described as a gesture of goodwill On 8 March 2005, Maskhadov was killed in an operation by Russian security forces in the Chechen community of Tolstoy-Yurt, northeast of Grozny.\n\n\nAmnesties\nAs of November 2007, there were at least seven amnesties for separatist militants, as well as federal servicemen who committed crimes, declared in Chechnya by Moscow since the start of the second war The first one was announced in 1999 when about 400 Chechen switched sides (However, according to Putin's advisor and aide Aslambek Aslakhanov most of them were since killed, both by their former comrades and by the Russians, who by then perceived them as a potential \"fifth column\" [152]) Some of the other amnesties included one during September 2003 in connection with the adoption of the republic's new constitution, and then another between mid-2006 and January 2007 [citation needed] In 2007, the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights published a report entitled Amnestied People as Targets for Persecution in Chechnya, which documents the fate of several persons who have been amnestied and subsequently abducted, tortured and killed.\n\n\nGovernment censorship of the media coverage\nThe first war, with its extensive and largely unrestricted coverage (despite deaths of many journalists), convinced the Kremlin more than any other event that it needed to control national television channels, which most Russians rely on for news, to undertake any major national policy By the time the second war began, federal authorities had designed and introduced a comprehensive system to limit the access of journalists to Chechnya and shape their coverage [153]\n\n\nEffects\nIn the Second Chechen War, over 60,000 combatants and non-combatants were killed [159] Civilian casualty estimates vary widely According to the pro-Moscow Chechnya government, 160,000 combatants and non-combatants died or have gone missing in the two wars, including 30,000–40,000 Chechens and about 100,000 Russians, [160] [161] while separatist leader Aslan Maskhadov (deceased) repeatedly claimed about 200,000 ethnic Chechens died as a consequence of the two conflicts [162] As in the case of military losses, these claims can not be independently verified According to a count by the Russian human rights group Memorial in 2007, up to 25,000 civilians have died or disappeared since 1999 [163] According to Amnesty International in 2007, the second war killed up to 25,000 civilians since 1999, with up to another 5,000 people missing [25] However, the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society set their estimate of the total death toll in two wars at about 150,000 to 200,000 civilians [164]\n\n\nCivilian losses\nIn the Second Chechen War, over 60,000 combatants and non-combatants were killed [159] Civilian casualty estimates vary widely According to the pro-Moscow Chechnya government, 160,000 combatants and non-combatants died or have gone missing in the two wars, including 30,000–40,000 Chechens and about 100,000 Russians, [160] [161] while separatist leader Aslan Maskhadov (deceased) repeatedly claimed about 200,000 ethnic Chechens died as a consequence of the two conflicts [162] As in the case of military losses, these claims can not be independently verified According to a count by the Russian human rights group Memorial in 2007, up to 25,000 civilians have died or disappeared since 1999 [163] According to Amnesty International in 2007, the second war killed up to 25,000 civilians since 1999, with up to another 5,000 people missing [25] However, the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society set their estimate of the total death toll in two wars at about 150,000 to 200,000 civilians [164]\n\n\nEnvironmental damage\nEnvironmental agencies warn that the Russian republic of Chechnya, devastated by war, now faces ecological disaster A former aide to Boris Yeltsin believes Russian bombing has rendered Chechnya an \"environmental wasteland.\" [165] There is a special concern over widespread oil spills and pollution from sewers damaged by war (the water is polluted to a depth of 250 m [166]), and chemical and radioactive pollution, as a result of the bombardment of chemical facilities and storages during the conflict [167] Chechnya's wildlife also sustained heavy damage during the hostilities, as animals that had once populated the Chechen forests have moved off to seek safer ground [168] In 2004, Russian government has designated one-third of Chechnya a \"zone of ecological disaster\" and another 40% \"a zone of extreme environmental distress\" [169]\n\n\nLand mines\nChechnya is the most land mine-affected region worldwide [170] Since 1994 there have been widespread use of mines by both sides (Russia is a party to the 1980 Convention on Conventional Weapons but not the 1996 protocol on land mines and other devices) The most heavily mined areas of Chechnya are those in which separatists continued to put up resistance, namely the southern regions, as well as the borders of the republic [171] No humanitarian mine clearance has taken place since the HALO Trust was evicted by Russia in December 1999 In June 2002, Olara Otunnu, the UN official, estimated that there were 500,000 land mines placed in the region UNICEF has recorded 2,340 civilian land mine and unexploded ordnance casualties occurring in Chechnya between 1999 and the end of 2003.\n\n\nMilitary losses\nMilitary casualty figures from both sides are impossible to verify and are generally believed to be higher In September 2000, the Kavkaz Center compiled a list of casualties officially announced in the conflict, which, although incomplete and with little factual value, provide some minimal insight of the casualties [172] According to the figures released by the Russian Ministry of Defence in August 2005, at least 1,250 Russian Armed Forces soldiers were killed in action in 1999–2005 This death toll did not include losses of Internal Troops, the FSB, police and local paramilitaries, of whom all at least 1,720 were killed by October 2003 [164] Independent Russian and Western estimates are much higher; the Union of the Committees of Soldiers' Mothers of Russia, for instance, estimated about 2,000 Russian Army servicemen have been killed between 1999 and 2003 [163]\n\n\nPolitical radicalization of the separatist movement\nThe Chechens had become increasingly radicalized Former Soviet Armed Forces officers Dzhokhar Dudayev and Aslan Maskhadov were succeeded by people who rely more on Islamist doctrine, rather than the secular nationalistic feelings of the population While Dudayev and Maskhadov were seeking from Moscow recognition of the independence of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, other leaders spoke out more about the need to expel Russia from the territory of the whole North Caucasus, an impoverished mountain region inhabited mostly by Muslim, non-Russian ethnic groups [citation needed]\n\n\nImpact on the Chechen population\nAccording to a 2006 report by Médecins Sans Frontières, \"the majority of Chechens still struggle through lives burdened by fear, uncertainty and poverty.\" A survey conducted by MSF in September 2005 showed that 77% of the respondents were suffering from \"discernible symptoms of psychological distress\" [179]\n\n\nImpact on the Russian population\nThe start of the war bolstered the domestic popularity of Vladimir Putin as the campaign was started one month after he had become Russian prime minister [158] The conflict greatly contributed to the deep changes in the Russian politics and society [192]\n\n\nStatus\nIn 2005, there were about 60,000 Federal troops in Chechnya, but that number has since decreased significantly Tony Wood, a journalist and author who has written extensively about Chechnya, estimated there were about 8,000 local security forces remaining in the region as of 2007 [update] Independent analysts say there are no more than 2,000 armed terrorists combatants still fighting, while Russia says only a few hundred remain There is still some sporadic fighting in the mountains and south of the republic, but Russia has scaled down its presence significantly leaving the local government to stabilize things further [163]  In February 2008 the President of the separatist Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, Dokka Umarov, spoke of \"thousands of fighters\" when he addressed a speech to all his fighters in the mountains [203]\n\n\nSee

downtown photography studio was destroyed in a fire, and for a time, he seemingly would not be able to recover from the aftermath and resume his career As a result of his stress, Henry ended up hospitalized for a bleeding ulcer.\n\n\nSyndication (1987–1988)\nAfter two seasons, NBC saw that Punky Brewster and its principal Sunday night stablemate, the four-year-old Silver Spoons, could not compete as strongly as they hoped against CBS' juggernaut 60 Minutes, and cancelled both programs [10] [11] Like many cult-favorite sitcoms of the time, Punky Brewster was revived for syndication (as was Silver Spoons) Production on Punky went undelayed, and its third season began shooting on schedule While the show was in production throughout the 1986–87 season, it did not return to the air via syndication until October 30, 1987 [12] Beginning on that premiere date, Punky was packaged such that new episodes would air every weekday (usually late in the afternoon on independent stations) The entire third season (1986–87) aired in the five-days-a-week format through December 8, 1987.\n\n\nRevival (2021)\nIn June 2019, UCP announced plans for a new Punky Brewster series starring Soleil Moon Frye The series revisits Punky as a single mother of three “trying to get her life back on track when she meets a young girl who reminds her a lot of her younger self.” [14] The series also features Cherie Johnson, returning to the role named after her, as well as Freddie Prinze Jr as Punky's ex-husband [15] In early 2020, NBC confirmed the revival consisting of a ten-episode first season that will air on its new streaming Peacock network [3] The revival premiered on February 25, 2021 [16] In August 2021, the series was canceled after one season [17]\n\n\nEpisodes\nThe show was produced by

Gary Portnoy and Judy Hart Angelo and sung by Portnoy.\n\n\nOrigin of the name\nNBC programming chief Brandon Tartikoff named the series after a girl he had a crush on in his own childhood: an older tomboy named Peyton \"Punky\" Brewster Before the series aired, NBC tracked her down (by this time, she was married and named Peyton Rutledge) and secured her permission to use her name for the lead character Rutledge was even hired to do a cameo in one episode as a teacher at Punky's school (in the opening scene of the episode titled \"The Search\", aired November 10, 1985) so that both the real

The show was created by David W. Duclon and produced by Lightkeeper Productions and NBC Productions. The series follows the life of a young girl named Penelope \"Punky\" Brewster, played by Soleil Moon Frye, and her adventures with her friends and family in Chicago.\n\n**Synopsis**\n\nPenelope \"Punky\" Brewster is a warm, funny, and bright child who lives with her father, Henry, and her dog, Brandon. However, Punky's life takes a dramatic turn when her father walks out on the family, leaving her and her mother alone. In a heartbreaking scene, Punky's mother abandons her at a Chicago shopping center, leaving Punky to fend for herself. Fortunately, Punky discovers a vacant apartment in a local building, where she can live with her father and Brandon.\n\n**Season 1 (1984-1985)**\n\nDuring the first season, Margaux's socialite mother appears on a recurring basis, as does kooky maintenance man Eddie Malvin. Eddie disappears after the first several episodes, but his character is still mentioned throughout the season. The first season focuses on Punky's adjustment to her new life with her father and her struggles to fit in with her new friends.\n\n**Season 2 (1985-1986)**\n\nThe second season introduces a new storyline, where Henry's downtown photography studio is destroyed in a fire. The aftermath of the fire causes stress and tension in Henry's life, leading to a bleeding ulcer that requires hospitalization. This season also sees the introduction of new characters, including a new teacher at Punky's school.\n\n**Syndication (1987-1988)**\n\nAfter two seasons, NBC saw that Punky Brewster and its principal Sunday night stablemate, the four-year-old Silver Spoons, could not compete as strongly as they hoped against CBS' juggernaut 60 Minutes. As a result, both programs were canceled. However, like many cult-favorite sitcoms of the time, Punky Brewster was revived for syndication. The show was packaged such that new episodes would air every weekday, usually late in the afternoon on independent stations.\n\n**Revival (2021)**\n\nIn June 2019, UCP announced plans for a new Punky Brewster series starring Soleil Moon Frye. The series revisits Punky as a single mother of three \"trying to get her life back on track when she meets a young girl who reminds her a lot of her younger self.\" The series also features Cherie Johnson, returning to the role of Cherie, as well as Freddie Prinze Jr as Punky's ex-husband. The revival premiered on February 25, 2021, but was canceled after one season.\n\n**Episodes**\n\nThe show was produced by Lightkeeper Productions, and NBC Productions during the network run. NBC was not allowed to co-produce the series when it moved into syndication, due to then-existing FCC regulations regarding network involvement in syndicated TV programming. As a result, a syndication deal was made with Coca-Cola Telecommunications to co-produce two more seasons of episodes, plus U.S syndication rights to the NBC-era episodes.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe show features a talented cast of characters, including:\n\n* Soleil Moon Frye as Penelope \"Punky\" Brewster\n* George Gaynes as Henry Brewster\n* Cherie Johnson as Cherie\n* Eddie Deezen as Eddie Malvin\n* Ayne Terrell as Margaux\n* T.K.

Before the series aired, NBC tracked her down (by this time, she was married and named Peyton Rutledge) and secured her permission to use her name for the lead character. Rutledge was even hired to do a cameo in one episode as a teacher at Punky's school, so that both the real and fictional Punky Brewster could be on-screen at the same time.\n\n**Home media**\n\nAll four seasons have been released on DVD in Region 1 by Shout!

carried during the winter 2020 season, out of bankruptcy were abandoned RedBird Capital Partners, which would have financed the purchase, instead brought on Dany Garcia and Dwayne Johnson as partners to purchase that league  [11] In October 2020, Fox struck an agreement with The Spring League to partially finance and broadcast that league's games [12]\n\n\n2022 season\nFor the 2022 season NBC and Fox Sports were the league's two official broadcast partners, with Fox carrying 22 games and NBC carrying 21 Telecasts for the 2022 season were produced by Fox Sports and NBC Sports Fox broadcast 13 regular season games (1 simulcast with NBC), 1 semi-final, and the championship game [100] NBC broadcast 8 regular season games (1 simulcast with Fox)  and 1 semi-final Peacock broadcast 4 games exclusively and simulcast all NBC games (including the opening game simulcast with Fox and NBC) Other games air on Cable networks USA Network (9 games) and FS1 (7 games) [101]\n\n\n2023 season\nTelecasts for the 2023 season will air on Fox, FS1, NBC and USA Network Fox will air 17 regular season games and 1 semi-final, NBC will broadcast 9 regular season games, 1 semi-final and the Championship game, and FS1 and USA Network will broadcast 7 games each Unlike the 2022 season, in order to increase the leagues exposure, Peacock will not air exclusive games Instead, Peacock will simply simulcast all NBC and USA Network games An emphasis will also be made on having high-profile events serve as lead-ins to the league, with some games following NASCAR and Major League Baseball broadcasts on Fox or the Kentucky Derby on NBC [110]\n\n\nUSFL–XFL merger\nOn June 27, 2023, President of Football Operations Daryl Johnston confirmed in an interview that the league will return for the 2024 season [43] Discussions between USFL and XFL for a potential merger began in July [11] On September 19, 2023, Axios reported that discussions had advanced far enough that a merger was possible before each league's 2024 season [44] On September 28, 2023, the USFL and XFL announced their intent to merge [45] The merger would require regulatory approval, [46] which was granted November 30 [47] The merger was formally announced December 31.\n\n\nTeams\nThe league announced the 2022 season will be played \"with a minimum of eight teams.\" [48] In addition to obtaining the rights to the USFL name and logo, the new league has obtained the rights to the aforementioned former league's team names including the Los Angeles Express, Chicago Blitz, Tampa Bay Bandits, and Houston Gamblers [49] [50] Additionally, the Generals rights are owned by The Spring League, another Woods entity Since its original announcement, the USFL had purchased more trademarks including new

room Scott Mellanby reacted by \"one-timing\" the rat against the wall, killing it That night, he scored two goals, which Vanbiesbrouck quipped was \"a rat trick.\" Two nights later, as the story found its way into the world, a few fans threw rubber rats on the ice in celebration of a goal The rubber rat count went from 16 for the third home game to over 2,000 during the playoffs [17]\n\n\nNew

general manager Tom Rowe was promoted to general manager [34] After an 11–10–1 start to the season, the Panthers fired head coach Gerard Gallant and general manager Tom Rowe took over as interim head coach [35] At the end of the season, Rowe was relieved of his duties as both coach and general manager and was named special advisor to Tallon, who returned to positions of team president and general manager [36] On June 12, 2017, the Panthers named Bob Boughner as their new head coach [37]\n\n\nArrival of Bill Zito and Stanley Cup contention (2020–present)\nPanthers management hired Bill Zito to

first-round pick, and prospect Cole Schwindt to the Calgary Flames in exchange for forward Matthew Tkachuk and a mid-round draft pick [55] The Tkachuk–Hubderdeau trade saw two 100-point NHL scorers traded for each other for the first time since 1988, when Wayne Gretzky was traded for Jimmy Carson [56] This trade was also the first sign-and-trade in NHL history as Tkachuk was a restricted free

Florida Panthers are a professional ice hockey team based in Sunrise, Florida, in the United States. They are members of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Hockey League (NHL). The team was established on December 10, 1992, and has a rich history in the NHL, with many notable players and coaches contributing to their success.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Florida Panthers were awarded an NHL franchise on December 10, 1992, to Wayne Huizenga, the owner of Blockbuster Video. At the same time, The Walt Disney Company earned the rights to start a team in Anaheim, which would become the Mighty Ducks. Huizenga, who also owned the Florida Marlins of Major League Baseball (MLB) and a share of the National Football League (NFL)'s Miami Dolphins, announced that the team would play at the Miami Arena, sharing the building with the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s Miami Heat, until a new arena was built. Offices for the team were established in June 1993, with Dean Jordan, the vice president of business operations, admitting that none of the business people, including himself, knew anything about hockey.\n\n**Early years (1992-2000)**\n\nThe Panthers began their inaugural season in the 1993-1994 NHL season, with a team that included players such as John Vanbiesbrouck, Scott Mellanby, and Rob Niedermayer. Despite finishing with a record of 33-34-17 and missing the playoffs, the team showed promise and enthusiasm from their fans. The following season, the Panthers improved their record to 41-31-12, but still missed the playoffs. In the 1995-1996 season, the Panthers experienced a breakout season, finishing with a record of 41-31-10 and making the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. The team's success was highlighted by a unique goal celebration, known as the \"Rat Trick,\" which began when Scott Mellanby killed a rat that scurried across the team's locker room during the 1995-1996 home opener.\n\n**New arena and a decade of struggles (1998-2010)**\n\nIn 1998, the Panthers moved into the brand-new National Car Rental Center, now known as the Amerant Bank Arena. The team acquired Pavel Bure, known as the \"Russian Rocket,\" in a blockbuster trade with the Vancouver Canucks in 1998-1999. Bure helped the Panthers reach the playoffs again in 1999-2000, but they were swept in the first round by the New Jersey Devils, who would go on to win the Stanley Cup. The team slumped in the 2000-2001 season, and Huizenga sold the Panthers to an ownership group led by Alan Cohen. The following season, 2001-2002, the Panthers had their worst record ever, finishing with a record of 22-38-16.\n\n**Dale Tallon era (2010-2020)**\n\nOn May 17, 2010, the Panthers hired Dale Tallon as their new general manager. Tallon rebuilt the team with 2010 draft picks Erik Gudbranson, Nick Bjugstad, and Quinton Howden, as well as the acquisition of players such as Steve Bernier, Michael Grabner, Marty Reasoner, Ryan Carter, and Sergei Samsonov. The team had a disappointing 2010-2011 season, finishing with a record of 30-35-15. Tallon continued to rebuild the team, but the Panthers struggled to find consistency and make the playoffs.\n\n**The Blueprint (2010-2016)**\n\nTallon's rebuild plan, known as \"The Blueprint,\" aimed to create a competitive team by acquiring talent through the draft and free agency. The team drafted players such as Aaron Ekblad, Vincent Trochek, and Lawson Crouse, and acquired players such as Jussi Jokinen, Brandon Pirri, and Jaromir Jagr. The team showed promise in the 2013-2014 season, finishing with a record of 38-29-15 and making the playoffs for the first time since 1999-2000.\n\n**Front office miscues (2016-2020)**\n\nIn 2016, general manager Dale Tallon was promoted to an executive position within the organization, and assistant general manager Tom Rowe was promoted to general manager. The team struggled to find consistency and make the playoffs, with Rowe taking over as interim head coach in 2016-2017. The team fired Rowe at the end of the season and named Bob Boughner as their new head coach. Boughner's tenure was short-lived, and the team fired him in 2019-2020.\n\n**Arrival of Bill Zito and Stanley Cup contention (2020-present)**\n\nOn September 2, 2020, the Panthers hired Bill Zito as their new general manager. Zito's first season was shortened due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the team showed promise, finishing with a record of 26-9-6 and making the playoffs for the first time since 2015-2016. The team defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning in the first round, but lost to the Lightning in the second round.\n\n**Team identity**\n\nThe Florida Panthers have had just two primary logos over the course of their history. Their current primary logo is a shield with the profile of a panther head below the word \"Florida.\" The team's colors are black, silver, and red, with their alternate logo featuring a yellow sun behind a hockey stick and a palm tree. The team's mascot is Stanley C. Panther, a costumed panther character who attends games and interacts with fans.\n\n**Broadcasting**\n\nThe Panthers' designated television market includes South Florida. In July 2024, the team announced an agreement with the E.W. Scripps Company and its Scripps Sports division, under a multi-year deal beginning in the 2024-25 NHL season. Scripps' Miami-Fort Lauderdale station WSFL-TV 39 will serve as the flagship station of the Panthers' television network, while WHDT-TV 9 will air games in the Stuart-West Palm Beach market. WFTX-TV 36.3 will air games in the Fort Myers-Naples market.\n\n**Radio**\n\nThe team has a radio deal with Audacy, Inc. to broadcast Panther games on the radio.

reacted by \"one-timing\" the rat against the wall, killing it That night, he scored two goals, which Vanbiesbrouck quipped was \"a rat trick.\" Two nights later, as the story found its way into the world, a few fans threw rubber rats on the ice in celebration of a goal The rubber rat count went from 16 for the third home game to over 2,000 during the playoffs [17]\n\n\nNew arena and a decade of

emigrated to Belgium and the Netherlands in search of work and better living conditions [note 1] [19] This was also the case for Hakim Ziyech's father who left Morocco in 1967 with his two sons Faouzi and Hicham [note 2] for the Netherlands where he worked in a metal factory [17] Ziyech's mother joined her husband in the Netherlands at the age of eighteen and stayed at home and took care of the children in Dronten [20] [17] [21] Hakim has double nationality: Dutch and Moroccan [22] [23] With his brothers and his friends from the neighborhood, Ziyech spent hours playing football on the Cruyff Court esplanade opposite his home [24] [17] Learning his first skill moves there, football quickly became a passion [25] During his childhood, Ziyech regularly watched Ajax stars on television such as Wesley Sneijder, Zlatan Ibrahimović and Rafael van der Vaart [note 3] \"There were a few players I loved watching, like Ronaldinho and Zinedine Zidane ...players of that caliber I watched them a lot when I was little I remember when I was ten years old, I watched their videos on YouTube every day\", he said in an interview with UEFA in 2019 [26]\n\n\nClub career\nUnder the guidance of Aziz Doufikar, Ziyech would return to football, progressing through the youth teams of Reaal Dronten and later ASV Dronten He was also motivated by his older brother Faouzi to continue playing football and not to be discouraged [39] At the age of fourteen, he made his first return to Morocco to visit his father's grave [40] [41] On his return to the Netherlands, he was invited on trials with professional clubs SC Heerenveen and Ajax [15] After impressing the Heerenveen scouts, he left his home in Dronten to be placed with a foster family in the town of Heerenveen, Friesland, where he joined SC Heerenveen's academy in 2007 [42] [43] [44] Ajax had found Ziyech too small to progress in their academy [15] Once settled in at Heerenveen, he lived a turbulent life marked by delinquency, alcohol and drug problems, and he dropped out of school at age sixteen [45] [46] Despite a good relationship with his foster family, who are of Armenian origin \"he regularly comes home very late, sometimes drunk,\" says Doufikar [47] Having been an academy footballer for two years under youth coach Robin Veldman, [48] Ziyech very rarely participated in matches, spending his evenings until five in the morning in the neighbourhood drinking alcohol and using hard drugs [49] [50] Doufikar described Ziyech during his first years in Heerenveen's academy:\n\n\nHeerenveen\nUnder the guidance of

into positions where he poses a threat on goal, either with shots, through balls or crosses He is most dangerous coming into central areas and looking to play killer balls to teammates making diagonal runs towards goal from the left He is particularly skilled at playing deft balls over a defence, and if his teammates time their runs well, they often very suddenly find themselves with a one-on-one shooting opportunity His movement off the flank means the right-back can overlap [159]\n\n\nPersonal life\nOn 15 October 2023, Ziyech had shown support for the Palestinian cause [162] He expressed the phrase “From river to sea, Palestine will be free” [163]\n\n\nCareer statistics\nAjax [167]\n\n\nClub\nAjax [167]\n\n\nInternational\nAjax [167]\n\n\nHonours\nAjax

This law has been the subject of controversy and debate in Germany, particularly in regards to its application to anti-fascist symbols and its impact on artistic freedom.\n\n## The Relevant Excerpt of the Law\n\nThe relevant excerpt of the German criminal code reads:\n\n\"Wer eine Flagge oder ein anderes Symbol, ein Uniformzeichen oder ein Wahlspruch, ein Gruß oder ein anderes Abzeichen, das der Verfassung, dem Rechte oder der Menschenwürde Gewalt angetan hat, öffentlich Geeignet, auf eine Gesellschaft oder eine Organisation mit solchen Zielen zu deuten, verwendet, wird mit Freiheitsstrafe bis zu drei Jahren oder mit Geldstrafe bestraft.\"\n\nTranslation:\n\n\"Whoever publicly uses a flag or another symbol, a uniform sign or a motto, a greeting or another emblem, which has committed violence against the Constitution, the rights, or the dignity of man, which is capable of being interpreted as an indication of a society or organization with such objectives, shall be punished with imprisonment for up to three years or with a fine.\"\n\n## Symbols Affected\n\nThe text of the law does not name the individual symbols to be outlawed, and there is no official exhaustive list. A symbol may be a flag, emblem, uniform, or a motto or greeting formula. The prohibition is not tied to the symbol itself but to its use in a context suggestive of association with outlawed organizations. Thus, the Swastika is outlawed if used in a context of völkisch ideology, while it is legitimate if used as a symbol of religious faith, particularly any South, South Eastern or East Asian religions.\n\nSimilarly, the Wolfsangel is outlawed if used in the context of the Junge Front but not in other contexts such as heraldry, or as the emblem of \"landscape poet\" Hermann Löns.\n\n## Anti-Fascist Symbols\n\nIn 2005, a controversy was stirred about the question whether the paragraph should be taken to apply to the display of crossed-out swastikas as a symbol of anti-fascism. In late 2005, police raided the offices of the punk rock label and mail order store \"Nix Gut Records\" and confiscated merchandise depicting crossed-out swastikas and fists smashing swastikas.\n\nIn 2006, the Stade police department started an inquiry against anti-fascist youths using a placard depicting a person dumping a swastika into a trashcan. The placard was displayed in opposition to the campaign of right-wing nationalist parties for local elections.\n\n## Application to Forms of Media\n\nSection 86a includes a social adequacy clause that allows the use of the symbols that fall within it for the purposes of \"art or science, research or teaching.\" This generally allows these symbols to be used in literature, television shows (as with the 1968 Star Trek episode, \"Patterns of Force,\" itself allowed after 1995), films, and other works of art without censoring or modification and stay within the allowance for the clause.\n\nFor example, German cinemas were allowed to screen Raiders of the Lost Ark and Inglourious Basterds, films which feature frequent displays of Nazi symbols, without censorship.\n\n## Notes\n\nThe law has been the subject of controversy and debate in Germany, particularly in regards to its application to anti-fascist symbols and its impact on artistic freedom. The law has been criticized for being too broad and vague, and for restricting freedom of expression.\n\n## See Also\n\n* German Criminal Code\n* Freedom of Expression in Germany\n* Anti-Fascism in Germany\n\n## External Links\n\n* German Criminal Code ( Strafgesetzbuch )\n* Freedom of Expression in Germany ( Deutsche Gesellschaft für Informationsfreiheit )\n* Anti-Fascism in Germany ( Antifaschistische Aktion )", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Strafgesetzbuch_section_86a\" following this outline:\n\n\nText\nThe relevant excerpt of the German criminal code reads: [1] [2] [3]\n\n\nSymbols affected\nThe text of the law does not name the individual symbols to be outlawed, and there is no official exhaustive list A symbol may be a flag, emblem, uniform, or a motto or greeting formula The prohibition is not tied to the symbol itself but to its use in a context suggestive of association with outlawed organizations Thus, the Swastika is outlawed if used in a context of völkisch ideology, while it is legitimate if used as a symbol of religious faith, particularly any South, South Eastern or East Asian religions Similarly, the Wolfsangel is outlawed if used in the context of the Junge Front but not in other contexts such as heraldry, or as the emblem of \"landscape poet\" Hermann Löns [citation needed]\n\n\nAnti-fascist symbols\nIn 2005, a controversy was stirred about the question whether the paragraph should be taken to apply to the display of crossed-out swastikas as a symbol of anti-fascism [32] In late 2005 police raided the offices of the punk rock label and mail order store \"Nix Gut Records\" and confiscated merchandise depicting crossed-out swastikas and fists smashing swastikas In 2006 the Stade police department started an inquiry against anti-fascist youths using a placard depicting a person dumping a swastika into a trashcan The placard was displayed in opposition to the campaign of right-wing nationalist parties for local elections [33]\n\n\nApplication to forms of media\nSection 86a includes a social adequacy clause that allows the use of the symbols that fall within it for the purposes of \"art or science, research or teaching\" This generally allows these symbols to be used in literature, television shows (as with the 1968 Star Trek episode, \"Patterns of Force\", itself allowed after 1995), [37] films, and other works of art without censoring or modification and stay within the allowance for the clause For example, German cinemas were allowed to screen Raiders of the Lost Ark and Inglourious Basterds, films which feature frequent displays of Nazi symbols, without censorship.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film stars Sydney Sweeney, Justice Smith, Natasha Liu Bordizzo, and Ben Hardy. It follows the story of a young couple, Pippa and Thomas, who move into their first apartment together in Montreal and soon find themselves drawn into the lives of their neighbors, a couple they watch through their windows.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film begins with the introduction of Pippa and Thomas, who are moving into their first apartment together in Montreal. As they unpack and settle into their new home, they notice that their windows look directly into the apartment across the street from them. This realization sparks their curiosity, and they begin to watch the couple who live in the apartment, giving them the pseudo names of Margot and Brent.\n\nAs Pippa and Thomas continue to observe their neighbors, they learn that Margot is a successful businesswoman and that Brent is a professional photographer. They also begin to notice that Margot and Brent's relationship seems to be on the rocks, and they frequently argue and fight. Despite their initial embarrassment, Pippa and Thomas find themselves becoming more and more invested in the lives of their neighbors, often to the point of feeling like they are a part of the couple's drama.\n\n## Themes\n\nOne of the main themes of the film is the idea of voyeurism, and the ways in which people become fascinated by the lives of others. Pippa and Thomas's constant observation of Margot and Brent serves as a metaphor for the ways in which we all watch and observe the people around us, often without even realizing it. The film also explores the theme of relationships, and the ways in which they can be both beautiful and painful.\n\nAnother theme that is present in the film is the idea of control and power. Pippa and Thomas, who are watching their neighbors from the safety of their own home, begin to feel a sense of control over the lives of Margot and Brent. This sense of control leads them to make decisions that they would not normally make, and ultimately creates a sense of tension and unease.\n\n# Cast\n\nThe film features a talented cast of actors, including Sydney Sweeney, Justice Smith, Natasha Liu Bordizzo, and Ben Hardy. Sydney Sweeney plays the role of Pippa, a young woman who is torn between her desire to observe her neighbors and her growing sense of unease about the situation. Justice Smith plays the role of Thomas, Pippa's boyfriend, who is initially hesitant to participate in the voyeuristic activities but eventually becomes more and more invested.\n\nNatasha Liu Bordizzo plays the role of Margot, the woman who lives across the street from Pippa and Thomas. Margot is a successful businesswoman who is struggling to come to terms with her relationship with Brent. Ben Hardy plays the role of Brent, a professional photographer who is struggling to find his place in the world.\n\n# Production\n\nThe film was written and directed by Michael Mohan, who also serves as the film's producer. The film was produced under the banner of Divide/Conquer, a production company that has produced a number of other successful films and television shows. The film was distributed by Amazon Studios, who released it on their streaming service in September 2021.\n\n## Filming Locations\n\nThe film was shot on location in Montreal, Canada, and features a number of beautiful and atmospheric locations. The film's cinematography is noteworthy, capturing the beauty of the city and its surroundings in a way that is both poetic and haunting.\n\n# Release\n\nThe Voyeurs was released on September 10, 2021, on the Amazon Prime Video streaming service.

incomplete pass on third down, USC stopped Cal's run play to win the game [47] Rodgers commented that it was \"frustrating that we couldn't get the job done.\" [47] Overall, he finished the 2004 season with 2,566 passing yards, 24 touchdowns, and eight interceptions His 66.1% pass completion percentage led the Pac-10 [48] [49] He finished ninth in Heisman Trophy voting [50]\n\n\nCollege

regular season He threw for 24 touchdowns and only eight interceptions in his last college season, impressing many NFL scouts They commented that he was a \"talented strong-armed junior\" [53] who \"combines arm strength, mechanics and delivery to make all the throws\", but noted that his stats could be inflated due to playing in a quarterback-friendly system and that he would need to adjust to the more elaborate defensive schemes of the NFL [53]\n\n\nProfessional career\nRodgers was expected to be selected early in the 2005 NFL Draft as he had posted impressive numbers as a junior with Cal,

Packers' starting quarterback position to Rodgers for the 2008 season Although Favre decided to return from retirement, he was traded to the New York Jets, which meant that Rodgers would become the starter [78]\n\n\n2009\nFor the opening game of the 2009 season, Rodgers recorded his first win in a comeback situation The Packers were trailing at the beginning of the fourth quarter when Rodgers completed a fifty-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Greg Jennings with about a minute remaining in the game to contribute to the 21–15 victory over the Chicago Bears [88]\n\n\n2010: Super Bowl XLV season\nIn 2010, Rodgers led the Packers to a 2–0 start, but then lost three of their next four games, including back-to-back overtime losses The two overtime defeats brought Rodgers' record in overtime games to 0–5 [107]\n\n\n2011: First MVP\nBecause of the 2011 NFL lockout, the Packers and Rodgers did not schedule unofficial off-season workouts, despite many teams doing so [128] Rodgers and the Packers quickly quelled any concerns over their readiness by defeating the Saints, who had scheduled off-season workouts, 42–34 He had 312 passing yards and three touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week [129] [130] After the game, Rodgers said in the press conference, \"I was going to ask myself, what would have happened if we had offseason workouts? I mean, could we have started any faster and scored more points tonight?\" [131]\n\n\n2012\nRodgers and the Packers started off the 2012 season with a 30–22 loss to the 49ers [152] With the loss, Rodgers lost his bet with the music group Boyz II Men, and had to wear an Alex Smith jersey during the next week of practice [153] Had the Packers won the game, Boyz II Men would have sung the national anthem during their next home game at Lambeau [153]\n\n\n2013\nOn April 26, 2013, the Packers and Rodgers agreed to a 5-year, $110 million contract extension making him the highest paid player in NFL history [169] The Packers began their 2013 season against the reigning NFC champions, the 49ers, the team that also ended their playoff run the previous season Rodgers went 21 for 37 in completions, 333 yards, three touchdowns and an interception in the 34–28 loss [170] The following week, Rodgers had a career-high 480 passing yards to tie the franchise record in the 38–20 home-opener win against the Washington Redskins He earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his effort against the Redskins [171] [172] His 335 passing yards in the first half set a club record

of 41 consecutive games without throwing multiple interceptions come to an end in a loss to the Cincinnati Bengals by the score of 34–30 [175] [176]\n\n\n2014: Second MVP\nThe Packers' 2014 regular season debut came against the defending Super Bowl champion Seahawks—a game in which they would go on to lose 36–16 [192] In Week 2, the team began the game with a 21–3 deficit against the Jets, but came back and won 31–24 [193] The 18-point comeback marked the biggest comeback in Rodgers' career [194] In the third week of the season, the Packers offense was shut down by the Lions' defense, 19–7 [195] The Packers' 7 points were the fewest points allowed in a game Rodgers finished; the 223 yards of total Packer offense were the lowest since Rodgers took over at quarterback and his 162 passing yards were also a career low For the third consecutive season, the Packers were off to a 1–2 start In those three games, Rodgers threw five touchdowns and one interception combined, with a passer

attempt and finished with a passer rating of 92.7, all career lows Pro Bowl wide receiver Jordy Nelson's absence due to injury for the season was considered a contributing factor in Rodgers' statistical drop compared to previous seasons [230] [231] [232]\n\n\n2016\nThroughout the first five games of the 2016 season, Rodgers' struggles from the 2015 season appeared to continue [245]

Rodgers had his 50th career game with at least 300 passing yards He finished the game with 311, but his streak of 251 consecutive passes without an interception came to an end when defensive tackle

[298]\n\n\n2019\nRodgers started the 2019 season with a new head coach in Matt LaFleur following the departure of Mike McCarthy [319] The Packers offense relied less on Rodgers' trademark passes and more on heavy formations and play-action throws to take advantage of running back Aaron Jones [320]\n\n\n2020: Third MVP\nPrior to a Week 5 bye, Rodgers helped lead the Packers to a four-game winning streak to start the 2020 season [334] That winning streak would end in Week 6 against the Buccaneers, in which Rodgers threw for 160 yards and two interceptions, including a pick-six (the third of his professional career), during the 38–10 loss [335] After a 3–2 stretch for the team, Rodgers threw for 211 yards and four touchdowns in a 41–25 victory over the Bears in Week 12 During the game, he

first-team [343] The Pro Football Writers of America named him the NFL MVP [344]\n\n\n2021: Fourth MVP\nRodgers' 2021 season had a rough start, as he completed 15 of 28 passes for 133 yards and two interceptions as Green Bay lost 38–3 to the Saints at TIAA Bank Field [354] He was pulled in the fourth quarter for Jordan Love as his chance of a comeback was all but eliminated [355] However, Rodgers and the Packers recovered, going on a seven-game winning streak following the loss to New Orleans [356]\n\n\n2022: Final season in Green Bay\nOn March 8, Rodgers confirmed that he would return and play for the Packers for the 2022 season after speculations that Rodgers could retire or demand a trade to another team [377] There were reports that Rodgers and the Packers had agreed to terms on a 4-year, $200 million contract extension that would have made him the highest-paid player in NFL history, but Rodgers denied those reports on Twitter, stating that the numbers on the proposed contract were inaccurate, and that he had yet to sign such a contract He did confirm, however, that he would return to play his 18th NFL season with the Packers [378] [379]\n\n\nNew York Jets\nOn

as quarterback of the Packers before being traded to the Jets [398] Although Joe Namath granted Rodgers permission to wear his retired No 12 jersey, Rodgers announced that he would return to wearing

She is the founder and leader of the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) party and has been a prominent figure in Indian politics for over four decades.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nMamata Banerjee was born on January 5, 1955, in Calcutta (now Kolkata), West Bengal, to a Bengali Hindu Brahmin family. Her parents were Promileswar Banerjee and Gayetri Devi. Banerjee's father, Promileswar, died due to lack of medical treatment when she was 17 years old. This event had a significant impact on her life and politics, shaping her views on healthcare and social welfare.\n\n**Early Political Career**\n\nBanerjee began her political career in the 1970s as a young woman, joining the Congress party. In 1975, she gained attention in the press media when she danced on the car of socialist activist and politician Jayaprakash Narayan as a protest against him. This act of defiance marked the beginning of her involvement in politics. She quickly rose in the ranks of the local Congress group and remained the general secretary of Mahila Congress (Indira), West Bengal, from 1976 to 1980.\n\n**Congress Party Career**\n\nIn the 1984 general election, Banerjee became one of India's youngest parliamentarians ever, defeating veteran Communist politician Somnath Chatterjee to win the Jadavpur parliamentary constituency in West Bengal. She also became the general secretary of the Indian Youth Congress in 1984. Banerjee was re-elected in the 1991 general elections, having settled into the Calcutta South constituency. She retained the Kolkata South seat in the 1996, 1998, 1999, 2004, and 2009 general elections.\n\n**Founding Trinamool Congress**\n\nIn 1997, due to differences in political views with the then West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee president Somendra Nath Mitra, Banerjee left the Congress Party in West Bengal and became one of the founding members of the All India Trinamool Congress, along with Mukul Roy. The party quickly became the primary opposition party to the long-standing Communist government in the state.\n\n**Railway Minister (First Tenure)**\n\nIn 1999, Banerjee joined the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government and became Railways Minister. In 2000, she presented her first Railway Budget, in which she fulfilled many of her promises to her home state, West Bengal. She introduced a new biweekly New Delhi-Sealdah Rajdhani Express train and four express trains connecting various parts of West Bengal.\n\n**2001 West Bengal Elections**\n\nIn early 2001, after Tehelka's exposure of Operation West End, Banerjee walked out of the NDA cabinet and allied with the Congress Party for West Bengal's 2001 elections, to protest the corruption charges leveled by the website against senior ministers of the government.\n\n**Minister of Coal and Mines**\n\nBanerjee returned to the NDA government in September 2003 as a cabinet minister without any portfolio. Along with Mamata, her party colleague Sudip Banerjee was also inducted in the Vajpayee ministry. On January 9, 2004, she took charge as Ministry of Coal and Mines. During her short term as the minister of coal and mines, the government disallowed the sale of the National Aluminium Company.\n\n**2004–2006 Election Setbacks**\n\nIn the Indian general election of 2004, her party aligned with the Bharatiya Janata Party, but the alliance lost the election, and she was the only Trinamool Congress member to be elected from a parliamentary seat from West Bengal. Banerjee suffered further setbacks in 2005 when her party lost control of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation, and the sitting mayor, Subrata Mukherjee, defected from her party. In 2006, the Trinamool Congress was defeated in West Bengal's Assembly Elections, losing more than half of its sitting members.\n\n**Singur, Nandigram, and Other Movements**\n\nOn October 20, 2005, Banerjee protested against the forceful land acquisition and the atrocities perpetrated against local farmers in the name of the industrial development policy of the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government in West Bengal. She and her supporters followed the convoy of Benny Santoso, CEO of the Indonesia-based Salim Group, who had pledged a large investment in West Bengal.\n\n**Wrestler's Protest**\n\nSeveral Olympic and World Championships medal-winning wrestlers, including Sakshi Malik, Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia, and Sangeeta Phogat, have been protesting in Delhi demanding the arrest of Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Singh for allegedly sexually harassing several women wrestlers and a minor. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee took to the streets of Kolkata to support wrestlers in their protest.\n\n**Singur Protest**\n\nIn November 2006, Banerjee was forcibly stopped on her way to Singur for a rally against a proposed Tata Motors car project. She addressed a press conference at the assembly and announced a 12-hour shutdown by her party on Friday. After being arrested by police earlier in the day \"for violating prohibitory orders\" near Singur, she alleged that the administration had acted \"unconstitutionally\" by preventing her from entering Singur.\n\n**Nandigram Protest**\n\nIn 2007, a battalion of armed police stormed the rural area of Nandigram in the district of Purba Medinipur with the aim of quashing protests against the West Bengal government's plans to expropriate 10,000 acres (40 km2) of land for a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) to be developed by the Indonesian-based Salim Group. At least 14 villagers were shot dead and 70 more were wounded.\n\n**2009–2011 Electoral Progress**\n\nBefore the 2009 parliamentary elections, Banerjee allied with the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) led by the Indian National Congress. The alliance won 26 seats, and Banerjee joined the central cabinet as the railway minister (second tenure). In the 2010 Municipal Elections in West Bengal, TMC won the Kolkata Municipal Corporation by a margin of 62 seats.\n\n**Chief Minister of West Bengal**\n\nIn 2011, the All India Trinamool Congress along with SUCI and the INC won the West Bengal legislative assembly election against the incumbent Left Alliance by securing 227 seats. TMC won 184 seats with the INC winning 42 seats and the SUCI securing one seat. This marked the end of the longest-ruling democratically elected Communist party in the world.\n\n**First Term (2011–2016)**\n\nIn 2011, the All India Trinamool Congress along with SUCI and the INC won the West Bengal legislative assembly election against the incumbent Left Alliance by securing 227 seats. TMC won 184 seats with the INC winning 42 seats and the SUCI securing one seat.\n\n**Second Term (2016–2021)**\n\nIn the 2016 assembly elections, All India Trinamool Congress won with a landslide two-thirds majority under Mamata Banerjee winning 211 seats out of total 293. The party became the first ruling party to win without an ally since 1962 in West Bengal.\n\n**Third Term (2021–present)**\n\nIn the 2021 assembly elections, AITC won with a landslide two-thirds majority, but Mamata Banerjee, who fought from Nandigram, lost against Suvendu Adhikari of the Bharatiya Janata Party by 1,956 votes. However, she remained the Chief Minister of West Bengal.\n\n**Controversies and Criticism**\n\nBanerjee was widely criticized for the rape and murder of a young trainee doctor at R G Kar Medical College and Hospital and alleged coverup. She was accused of trying to protect the now ex-principal, Sandip Ghosh.\n\n**Personal Life and Recognitions**\n\nThroughout her political life, Banerjee has maintained a publicly austere lifestyle, dressing in simple traditional Bengali clothes and avoiding luxuries. During an interview in April 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed that despite their political differences, Banerjee sends her own selected kurtas and sweets to him every year.\n\n**Works in Literature and Other Fields**\n\nNumerous books written by Banerjee have been published so far.

Leung had been cast in the role [6] Cretton had wanted to cast Leung but was doubtful he would accept the part Despite this hesitation, producer Jonathan Schwartz decided to contact Leung and he

Callaham and Cretton [28] [73] The film was described as a \"sweeping superhero epic that combines emotional family drama with gravity-defying martial arts action\" Schwartz said much of Shang-Chi's arc within Marvel Comics is a family drama, and Cretton wanted to focus on that element for the film, exploring Shang-Chi's broken and abusive family background Liu noted that the comic book backstory for Shang-Chi is not widely known like those for comic book characters such as Batman or Spider-Man, and that gave the film's writers freedom to take more creative liberties with the story Cretton and Callaham were cognizant of some of the racial stereotypes surrounding the character in the comics, with Liu saying everyone involved was \"very sensitive to not have it go into stereotypical territory\" Cretton believed the resulting script was a \"really beautiful update\" to the character from what began in the comics [7]\n\n\nDesign\nSue Chan served as production designer for the film The first location that she and the crew scouted was San Francisco, where Chan previously lived She suggested Clement Street, \"the old Chinatown of San Francisco\", as the characters' home because it does not have the expected Chinatown cliches The film's San Francisco apartment set was one of Chan's favorites due to its accuracy to real Asian-American houses Another favorite was a restaurant set where Wenwu kills his enemies, for which Chan took inspiration from Hong Kong gangster films Cretton wanted Xialing's fight club to be fun and show her character rather than be scary and dangerous Chan noted that Xialing's office combines imagery of skulls with flowers and bold colors, and the sets incorporate the character's feminist views The fighting arena is an octagon because the number eight is significant in Asian cultures [77]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began in February 2020, [85] [86] shooting at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney and on location throughout the state of New South Wales, [61] under the working title Steamboat [87] William Pope served as cinematographer for the film, shooting on the Arri Alexa LF [88] Cretton chose Pope because he felt the cinematographer's style could be both naturalistic and heightened, and because of Pope's work on The Matrix (1999) which Cretton believed had the right tone for an MCU film focused on Asian and Asian-American characters [63] Pope already wanted to work with Cretton after being impressed by his film Short Term 12 (2013) [89] Cretton was inspired for his direction by Jackie Chan's filmography, the Ip Man series, Tai Chi Master (1993), and Kung Fu Hustle (2004) among others in the martial arts and kung-fu genres, [12] as well as anime and video games [74]\n\n\nChoreography\nCretton wanted to use a range of different fighting styles in the film due to Shang-Chi being trained in different types of martial arts These include the \"elegant, almost ethereal wushu style\" from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) and the \"kinetic\" fights of Jackie Chan's films Supervising stunt coordinator Brad Allan along with other members of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team became responsible for making the different styles feel consistent, [7] as well as containing elements of Hong Kong action cinema [60] Schwartz said there was a meaning for each fighting style in the film, and they helped to tell the story visually [7] Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is dedicated to Allan, who died in August 2021 [102] [103]\n\n\nPost-production\nNat Sanders and Elísabet Ronaldsdóttir served as co-editors on the film, [107] alongside Harry Yoon [108] In December 2020, Marvel revealed roles for several cast members, including Awkwafina as Shang-Chi's friend Katy, Yeoh as Jiang Nan, and Chieng as Jon Jon They also announced the casting of Zhang as Xialing, Fala Chen as Jiang Li, and Florian Munteanu as Razor Fist; [109] Munteanu was cast after Marvel Studios was impressed with his role in Creed II (2018) [110] In March 2021, the film's release date was pushed back once again to September 3, 2021, when Black Widow was shifted to the July 2021 date, [111] and Dallas Liu was revealed to be appearing [112]\n\n\nVisual effects\nChristopher Townsend was hired to be the visual effects supervisor for the film He worked with eleven different vendors, and also hired the Australia-based Joe Farrell to serve as an additional supervisor working with another five vendors They created more than 1,700 visual effects shots for the film Farrell supervised the bus sequence in Sydney (and remotely for the San Francisco portion of shooting) and said it was one of the most complicated sequences he and Townsend had worked on The scene featured 168 shots, with 40 to 50 of them being mostly digital The environment required digital pieces for the bus, buildings, and people Farrell said the sequence's motion made editing difficult, especially in regards to the nine passengers They were mapped out to know where they were at all times and sometimes were digitally moved around Because the Macau fight takes place on scaffolding outside a glass building, Rodeo FX had to rotoscope around the actors and replace the entire background A digital version of downtown Macau was created based on reference filming that Farrell again supervised remotely [88]\n\n\nMusic\nJoel P West, who scored Cretton's four previous films, returned to compose the score for Shang-Chi; [127] he acknowledged that this was the biggest film he had ever worked on West began working on the film when Cretton was hired and developed his ideas throughout the filmmaking process He wrote \"ominous\" and \"dominating\" music for Wenwu and more \"ethereal\" music for Ying Li, and then combined these to create Shang-Chi's music since the story is about him accepting both sides of his family West spent months researching Chinese music so he could incorporate traditional Chinese elements into the score, primarily for Ying Li and Ta Lo [128] Recording took place with a 70-piece London orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London by June 2021, [127] [128] with the UK Chinese Ensemble also providing traditional Chinese instruments and performances for the score [128]\n\n\nMarketing\nOn April 19, 2021, which was Liu's birthday, he shared the first teaser poster for the film This was shortly followed by Marvel releasing the first teaser trailer [73] Adam B Vary of Variety felt it was \"gratifying to finally see Liu in action as Shang-Chi\" and highlighted how the teaser provided further insight into details such as how the film would depict the Mandarin wearing the ten rings [18] Cole Delbyck at HuffPost said the \"eye-popping\" action was unlike anything seen in past MCU films [136] Writing for io9, Rob Bricken felt the teaser did not disappoint with its action, but the family drama was what made the film look compelling to him [137] Collider's Adam Chitwood called the teaser \"pretty fantastic\", comparing its story and tone to Black Panther and saying Shang-Chi looked to be \"an exciting, fresh, and new Marvel Cinematic Universe experience\" based on the teaser [73] Reactions to the poster and trailer in Chinese speaking regions in East Asia were more critical, with commentators believing both presented a stereotypical view of Chinese people and culture

the Ten Rings is a 2021 American superhero film directed by Destin Daniel Cretton and produced by Marvel Studios. The film is based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name created by Roy Thomas, Steve Englehart, and Brother Power. The story follows Shang-Chi, a martial artist who must confront his past and his family's dark secrets when he is drawn into a conflict with the Ten Rings organization.\n\n**Plot**\n\nA thousand years ago, Xu Wenwu discovers the mystical ten rings which grant godly powers including immortality. He establishes the Ten Rings organization, conquering kingdoms and toppling governments throughout history. In 1996, Wenwu searches for Ta Lo, a village said to harbor mythical beasts. He travels through a magical forest to the village entrance but is stopped by a guardian, Ying Li. The two soon fall in love, but the Ta Lo villagers reject Wenwu so Li chooses to leave with him. They marry and have two children, Shang-Chi and Xialing. Wenwu abandons his organization and locks away the ten rings.\n\n**Cast**\n\nAlso appearing in the film are Ronny Chieng as Jon Jon, Xialing's right-hand man and announcer at her underground fighting club; Jodi Long as Mrs Chen, Katy's mother; Dallas Liu as Ruihua, Katy's brother; Paul He as Chancellor Hui; Tsai Chin as Katy's grandmother; Andy Le as Death Dealer, one of Wenwu's assassins who trained Shang-Chi in his youth; Stephanie Hsu and Kunal Dudheker as Soo and John, married friends of Shang-Chi and Katy; Zach Cherry as Klev, a bus rider who livestreams one of Shang-Chi's fights; and Dee Baker as the voice of Morris, a hundun who befriends Slattery.

By that November, Cretton stepped down as director of the planned film Avengers: The Kang Dynasty to focus on his commitments to other MCU projects, including the Shang-Chi sequel. Filming was reported in April 2024 to begin in March 2025.

Margaret Loesch, former president and CEO of Marvel Productions, Stan Lee discussed a potential film or television series based on the Marvel Comics character Shang-Chi with actor Brandon Lee and his mother Linda Lee during the 1980s, with the intention of having Brandon Lee star as the character [44] Brandon's father, martial arts legend Bruce Lee, was the visual inspiration for artist Paul Gulacy when drawing Shang-Chi during his tenure on the Master of Kung Fu comic book in the 1970s [45] In 2001, Stephen Norrington signed on to direct a Shang-Chi film entitled The Hands of Shang-Chi

Lewis Tan and Simu Liu; [6] [65] Tan previously portrayed Zhou Cheng in Iron Fist [65] The studio was adamant that actors be of Chinese descent to audition for the character [64] Liu was considered earlier in the audition process and was brought back in for a second audition when the creatives were finding it difficult to cast the role [51] He tested again on July 14 and was officially cast on

film and Tony Leung had been cast in the role [6] Cretton had wanted to cast Leung but was doubtful he would accept the part Despite this hesitation, producer Jonathan Schwartz decided to contact Leung and he accepted the role after a meeting with Cretton [66]\n\n\nCasting\nMarvel Studios began testing actors in their 20s for the role of Shang-Chi in mid-July 2019, [64] including Lewis Tan and

accepted the role after a meeting with Cretton [66]\n\n\nWriting\nIn addition to Callaham, Cretton and Andrew Lanham also contributed to the screenplay for Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings from a story by Callaham and Cretton [28] [73] The film was described as a \"sweeping superhero epic that combines emotional family drama with gravity-defying martial arts action\" Schwartz said much of Shang-Chi's arc within Marvel Comics is a family drama, and Cretton wanted to focus on that element for the film, exploring Shang-Chi's broken and abusive family background Liu noted that the comic book backstory for Shang-Chi is not widely known like those for comic book characters such as Batman or Spider-Man, and that gave the film's writers freedom to take more creative liberties with the story Cretton and Callaham were cognizant of some of the racial stereotypes surrounding the character in the comics, with Liu saying everyone involved was \"very sensitive to not have it go into stereotypical territory\" Cretton believed the resulting script was a \"really beautiful update\" to the character from what began in the comics [7]\n\n\nDesign\nSue Chan served as production designer for the film The first location that she and the crew scouted was San Francisco, where Chan previously lived She suggested Clement Street, \"the old Chinatown of San Francisco\", as the characters' home because it does not have the expected Chinatown cliches The film's San Francisco apartment set was one of Chan's favorites due to its accuracy to real Asian-American houses Another favorite was a restaurant set where Wenwu kills his enemies, for which Chan took inspiration from Hong Kong gangster films Cretton wanted Xialing's fight club to be fun and show her character rather than be scary and dangerous Chan noted that Xialing's office combines imagery of skulls with flowers and bold colors, and the sets incorporate the character's feminist views The fighting arena is an octagon because the number eight is significant in Asian cultures [77]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began in February 2020, [85] [86] shooting at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney and on location throughout the state of New South Wales, [61] under the working title Steamboat [87] William Pope served as cinematographer for the film, shooting on the Arri Alexa LF [88] Cretton chose Pope because he felt the cinematographer's style could be both naturalistic and heightened, and because of Pope's work on The Matrix (1999) which Cretton believed had the right tone for an MCU film focused on Asian and Asian-American characters [63] Pope already wanted to work with Cretton after being impressed by his film Short Term 12 (2013) [89] Cretton was inspired for his direction by Jackie Chan's filmography, the Ip Man series, Tai Chi Master (1993), and Kung Fu Hustle (2004) among others in the martial arts and kung-fu genres, [12] as well as anime and video games [74]\n\n\nChoreography\nCretton wanted to use a range of different fighting styles in the film due to Shang-Chi being trained in different types of martial arts These include the \"elegant, almost ethereal wushu style\" from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) and the \"kinetic\" fights of Jackie Chan's films Supervising stunt coordinator Brad Allan along with other members of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team became responsible for making the different styles feel consistent, [7] as well as containing elements of Hong Kong action cinema [60] Schwartz said there was a meaning for each fighting style in the film, and they helped to tell the story visually [7] Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is dedicated to Allan, who died in August 2021 [102] [103]\n\n\nPost-production\nNat Sanders and Elísabet Ronaldsdóttir served as co-editors on the film, [107] alongside Harry Yoon [108] In December 2020, Marvel revealed roles for several cast members, including Awkwafina as Shang-Chi's friend Katy, Yeoh as Jiang Nan, and Chieng as Jon Jon They also announced the casting of Zhang as Xialing, Fala Chen as Jiang Li, and Florian Munteanu as Razor Fist; [109] Munteanu was cast after Marvel Studios was impressed with his role in Creed II (2018) [110] In March 2021, the film's release date was pushed back once again to September 3, 2021, when Black Widow was shifted to the July 2021 date, [111] and Dallas Liu was revealed to be appearing [112]\n\n\nVisual effects\nChristopher Townsend was hired to be the visual effects supervisor for the film He worked with eleven different vendors, and also hired the Australia-based Joe Farrell to serve as an additional supervisor working with another five vendors They created more than 1,700 visual effects shots for the film Farrell supervised the bus sequence in Sydney (and remotely for the San Francisco portion of shooting) and said it was one of the most complicated sequences he and Townsend had worked on The scene featured 168 shots, with 40 to 50 of them being mostly digital The environment required digital pieces for the bus, buildings, and people Farrell said the sequence's motion made editing difficult, especially in regards to the nine passengers They were mapped out to know where they were at all times and sometimes were digitally moved around Because the Macau fight takes place on scaffolding outside a glass building, Rodeo FX had to rotoscope around the actors and replace the entire background A digital version of downtown Macau was created based on reference filming that Farrell again supervised remotely [88]\n\n\nMusic\nJoel P West, who scored Cretton's four previous films, returned to compose the score for Shang-Chi; [127] he acknowledged that this was the biggest film he had ever worked on West began working on the film when Cretton was hired and developed his ideas throughout the filmmaking process He wrote \"ominous\" and \"dominating\" music for Wenwu and more \"ethereal\" music for Ying Li, and then combined these to create Shang-Chi's music since the story is about him accepting both sides of his family West spent months researching Chinese music so he could incorporate traditional Chinese elements into the score, primarily for Ying Li and Ta Lo [128] Recording took place with a 70-piece London orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London by June 2021, [127] [128] with the UK Chinese Ensemble also providing traditional Chinese instruments and performances for the score [128]\n\n\nMarketing\nOn April 19, 2021, which was Liu's birthday, he shared the first teaser poster for the film This was shortly followed by Marvel releasing the first teaser trailer [73] Adam B Vary of Variety felt it was \"gratifying to finally see Liu in action as Shang-Chi\" and highlighted how the teaser provided further insight into details such as how the film would depict the Mandarin wearing the ten rings [18] Cole Delbyck at HuffPost said the \"eye-popping\" action was unlike anything seen in past MCU films [136] Writing for io9, Rob Bricken felt the teaser did not disappoint with its action, but the family drama was what made the film look compelling to him [137] Collider's Adam Chitwood called the teaser \"pretty fantastic\", comparing its story and tone to Black Panther and saying Shang-Chi looked to be \"an exciting, fresh, and new Marvel Cinematic Universe experience\" based on the teaser [73] Reactions to the poster and trailer in Chinese speaking regions in East Asia were more critical, with commentators believing both presented a stereotypical view of Chinese people and culture

She posted the official track listing on August 6.\n\nCritical Reception\nRed (Taylor's Version) received universal critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received a weighted mean score of 91 based on 16 reviews; it is Swift's highest-rated project on the site.\n\nAccolades\nRed (Taylor's Version) received many accolades from the music industry, including placements on best-of lists.

Paper wrote that Swift's impact was \"felt across social media\", with the brands \"capitalizing on her momentum\", while Inc said that the companies leveraged the album's cultural relevance. Some media publications deemed Red (Taylor's Version) part of a 2021 music trend called \"Sad Girl Autumn\" or \"Sad Girl Fall\", which refers to the release of melancholic and introspective music by female artists during autumn.

The product was part of a collection designed by American architect and designer Michael Graves for JCPenney.\n\n## Background\n\nThe kettle was designed as part of a series of products by Michael Graves, a renowned architect and designer, for JCPenney. The company aimed to create a range of affordable, stylish products for the home. Graves' designs were known for their modern, sleek aesthetic, often incorporating bold colors and unique shapes. The Hitler teapot was no exception, featuring a distinctive black handle and lid top, as well as a spout that resembled a right arm raised in a Nazi salute.\n\n## The Image Goes Viral\n\nIn May 2013, a photograph of a billboard advertising the product on Interstate 405 in Culver City, California, was posted online. Internet users, particularly those on social news aggregator Reddit, were quick to notice the product's perceived resemblance to Adolf Hitler. Users pointed out the similarities between the kettle's design and Hitler's parted hairstyle and toothbrush moustache. The image of the Hitler teapot spread rapidly across social media, with many users sharing and commenting on the image.\n\n## Public Reaction\n\nThe public reaction to the Hitler teapot was intense and varied. Some people were amused by the resemblance and saw the product as a humorous example of pareidolia, a phenomenon in which individuals perceive meaningful images or patterns in otherwise random formations. Others were offended by the product's design, seeing it as a tasteless and insensitive reference to one of history's most notorious dictators. A poll conducted by KPCC listeners found that roughly 31% of respondents thought the kettle resembled Hitler, while roughly 25% thought it did not.\n\n## JCPenney's Response\n\nJCPenney quickly removed the billboard that sparked the initial attention to the product. In a statement, the company said that any resemblance of the kettle to Hitler was unintentional. The company's social media team tweeted: \"If we'd designed the kettle to look like something, we would've gone with a snowman.\" The statement was seen as an attempt to downplay the controversy and distance the company from the product's design.\n\n## Pareidolia and The Hitler Teapot\n\nThe Hitler teapot has been cited as an example of pareidolia, a phenomenon in which individuals perceive meaningful images or patterns in otherwise random formations. This phenomenon is a common occurrence in human perception, with people often seeing shapes or images in clouds, rock formations, or other natural features. The Hitler teapot is a notable example of pareidolia, with many people seeing a likeness between the kettle's design and the image of Adolf Hitler.\n\n## Hitlerization and The Hitler Teapot\n\nWriting in Haaretz, Gavriel Rosenfeld characterized the popularity of the Hitler teapot as being part of a wider phenomenon of \"Hitlerization\" and Hitler memes. This phenomenon refers to the widespread use of Hitler's image and name in popular culture, often in a humorous or satirical context. The Hitler teapot is a notable example of this phenomenon, with its design and image being used to comment on the nature of perception, satire, and cultural reference.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Hitler teapot is a product that has garnered significant attention and notoriety due to its perceived resemblance to Adolf Hitler. The product's design and image have been seen as a humorous example of pareidolia, as well as a commentary on the nature of perception and cultural reference. The controversy surrounding the product has highlighted the complexities of cultural reference and the power of pareidolia in shaping our perceptions of the world around us.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hitler_teapot\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nThe kettle was part of a collection of products designed by the American architect and designer Michael Graves for JCPenney [1] It first attracted attention in May 2013 when a photograph of a billboard advertising the product on Interstate 405 in Culver City, California, was posted online, and Internet users, especially of the social news aggregator Reddit, noted the kettle's perceived resemblance to Adolf Hitler, the dictator of Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945 The kettle's design incorporated a black handle and lid top that many users interpreted to look like Hitler's parted hairstyle and toothbrush moustache, as well as a spout that was thought to resemble a right arm raised in a Nazi salute [6] [7] In a poll of KPCC listeners, roughly 31 percent thought it resembled the dictator, while roughly 25 percent thought it did not [6]\n\n\nResponse\nDue to the media attention, JCPenney removed the billboard that sparked the initial heightened interest in the product, [6] [7] [8] and said that any resemblance of the kettle to Hitler was unintentional, stating in a tweet: \"If we'd designed the kettle to look like something, we would've gone  [with a] snowman\" [9] The Hitler teapot has been cited as an example of pareidolia, a phenomenon in which individuals perceive meaningful images or patterns in  otherwise random formations [5] [8] Writing in Haaretz, Gavriel Rosenfeld characterised the popularity of the Hitler teapot as being part of a wider phenomenon of \"Hitlerization\" and Hitler memes [10]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The game was released on October 12, 2021, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nBack 4 Blood is a spiritual successor to the Left 4 Dead series, developed by the same team that created the original games. The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where a parasite called the \"Devil Worm\" has infected most of humanity, turning them into vicious undead mutants called the \"Ridden\". The game follows a group of veteran survivors called the \"Cleaners\" as they fight to survive and defend a settlement called Fort Hope.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nIn Back 4 Blood, players join a four-person team of post-apocalyptic survivors called Cleaners, who must fight their way through levels populated by zombie-like monsters called the Ridden. Teammates are either controlled by other players or AI bots depending on matchmaking preferences and player availability. A feature of Back 4 Blood is cards, which are used to adjust various elements of gameplay. At the start of each level, players need to build their deck with cards that modify the player's health, damage, and stamina. Along with player cards, the AI Director will use Corruption cards against the player to hinder their progress. The AI can spawn extra enemies, activate a fog effect, and increase the size of the horde.\n\nIn addition to cards, the game features pre-defined hero characters who have preset attributes and abilities. Players can purchase upgrades and items with an in-game currency called Copper. The game also features a variety of playable characters, each with their own unique abilities and playstyles.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe game's campaign begins with Walker, \"Mom\", Evangelo, and Holly, arriving at a settlement in Evansburgh to trade supplies. A horde of mutated Ridden suddenly swarm and overrun Evansburgh. As the team retreats to Fort Hope, their commander, General Phillips, has them demolish the Washington Crossing Bridge to delay the Riddens' advance.\n\nAs the team fights to survive and defend Fort Hope, they encounter various other survivors who become allies and help them on their quest. The game's story is driven by the team's interactions with these characters, and the player's choices and actions have an impact on the outcome of the story.\n\n**Story**\n\nThe game's story is a central part of the Back 4 Blood experience. The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where the player must navigate the dangers of the Ridden and other hostile creatures to survive.

The player must work with their team to overcome challenges and defeat enemies, and the game rewards the player for building strong relationships with their teammates.\n\n**Development**\n\nBack 4 Blood was developed by Turtle Rock Studios, including seven of the developers who worked on the demo that became Left 4 Dead. According to the development team, Back 4 Blood features a more expanded story than the Left 4 Dead games, and has a more uplifting tone than other zombie games.\n\nPhil Robb, the game's creative director, added that the Cleaners are more confident and capable, unlike the everymen from Left 4 Dead. The team included the card systems because they felt that it can keep Back 4 Blood dynamic and challenging for veteran players. Turtle Rock added a Classic mode, a more accessible experience that removes the cards, for new players.\n\n**Reception**\n\nBack 4 Blood received \"generally favorable\" reviews for the PC and PlayStation 5 versions but \"mixed or average\" reviews for the Xbox Series X/S version, according to review aggregator Metacritic.

{"title": "Krishna_Janmashtami", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe meaning of the Sanskrit word Janmashtami can be understood by splitting it into the two words, \"Janma\" and \"Ashtami.\" The word \"Janma\" means birth [11] and the word \"Ashtami\" means eight; thus, Krishna Janmashtami is the celebration of Krishna's birth on the eighth day of the dark fortnight (Krishna Paksha) in the month of Bhadrapada (August–September) [12] [13]\n\n\nHistory\nInformation about Krishna's life is noted in the Mahabharata, the Puranas, and Bhagavata Purana Krishna is the eighth son of Devaki (mother) and Vasudeva (father) [5]  Surrounding the time of his birth, persecution was rampant, freedoms were being denied, and King Kamsa's life was threatened [14] Krishna was born within a prison in Mathura, India where his parents were constrained by his uncle, Kamsa [5] During Devaki's wedding, Kamsa was warned by a celestial voice that Devaki's eighth son would be the cause of his death [5] In an effort to defy this prophesy, Kamsa imprisoned his sister Devaki and her husband and promptly killed the first six of her newborns after their birth [5] The guards responsible for keeping watch over Devaki's cell fell asleep and the cell doors were miraculously opened at the time of Krishna's birth [5] These events allowed Vasudeva to send Krishna across the Yamuna River to his foster parents, Yashoda (mother) and Nanda (father) [5] This legend is celebrated on Janmashtami by people keeping fasts, singing devotional songs of love for Krishna, and keeping a vigil into the night [15]\n\n\nObservance and celebrations\nKrishna Janmashtami holds significant importance to Krishnaites as well as Hindus around the world, and it is celebrated in diverse forms depending on their regional and cultural customs [17] [6] Hindus celebrate Janmashtami by fasting, singing, praying together, preparing and sharing special food, night vigils, and visiting Krishna or Vishnu temples The places of Mathura and Vrindavan are visited by pilgrims [10] Some mandirs organize recitation of Bhagavad Gita in the days leading up to Janmashtami [18] Many northern Indian communities organize dance-drama events called Rasa Lila or Krishna Lila [15] The tradition of Rasa Lila is particularly popular in the Mathura region, in northeastern states of India such as Manipur and Assam, and in parts of Rajasthan and Gujarat It is acted out by numerous teams of amateur artists, cheered on by their local communities, and these drama-dance plays begin a few days before each Janmashtami [19] [20] People decorate their houses with flowers and light [21] On this day, people chant \"Hare Krishna hare Krishna, Krishna- Krishna Hare Hare\" The Janmashtami celebration is followed by Dahi Handi, which is celebrated the next day [22] [23]\n\n\nNorthern India\nJanmashtami is the largest festival in the Braj region of north India, in cities such as Mathura where Krishna was born according to Krishnaism, and in Vrindavan where he grew up [15] Vaishnava communities in these cities in Uttar Pradesh, as well as others in the state, as well as locations in Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana,

is celebrated in cities such as Mumbai, Latur, Nagpur and Pune [6] It is a celebration of joy and facilitator of social oneness [6] Dahi Handi is an enactment of how Krishna, during his childhood, would steal butter [31] This story is the theme of numerous reliefs on temples across India, as well as literature and dance-drama repertoire, symbolizing the joyful innocence of children, that love and life's play is the manifestation of god [32] [33]\n\n\nGujarat and Rajasthan\nIn Dwarka, Gujarat – where Krishna is believed to have established his kingdom – people celebrate the festival with a tradition similar to Dahi Handi, called Makhan Handi (pot with freshly churned butter) Others perform folk dances such and garba and raas, sing bhajans, and visit Krishna temples such as at the

using the Manipuri dance style [44] [45] [46] [47] The contextual roots of these dance drama arts are found in the ancient text Natya Shastra, but with influences from the culture fusion between India and southeast Asia [48] [49] [50]\n\n\nOdisha and West Bengal\nIn the eastern state of Odisha, specifically the region around Puri and in Nabadwip, West Bengal, the festival is also referred to as Sri Krishna Jayanti or simply Sri Jayanti [55] [56] People celebrate Janmashtami by fasting and worship until midnight The Bhagavata Purana is recited from the 10th chapter, a section dedicated to the

The widespread tradition of celebrating Krishna in these regions is credited to the efforts and teachings of 15th and 16th century Sankardeva and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Sankardeva introduced the musical composition, Borgeet, and dance-drama styles – Ankia Naat and Sattriya – that is now popular in West Bengal and Assam. In Manipur state, a traditional dance – Raas Leela – inspired by the theme of love and devotion between Krishna, Radha, and the gopis, is enacted using the Manipuri dance style. The contextual roots of these dance drama arts are found in the ancient text Natya Shastra, but with influences from the culture fusion between India and southeast Asia.\n\n**Odisha and West Bengal**\n\nIn the eastern state of Odisha, specifically the region around Puri and in Nabadwip, West Bengal, the festival is also referred to as Sri Krishna Jayanti or simply Sri Jayanti. People celebrate Janmashtami by fasting and worship until midnight. The Bhagavata Purana is recited from the 10th chapter, a section dedicated to the life of Krishna. The next day is called \"Nanda Ucchhaba\" or the joyous celebration of Krishna's foster parents Nanda and Yashoda. Devotees keep fasting during the entire day of Janmashtami. They bring water from Ganga to bathe Radha Madhaba during their abhisheka ceremony. A grand abhisheka is performed at midnight for the small Radha Madha. In Odisha, the Jagannath Temple in Puri, best known for its grand Ratha Yatra celebrations, perform a Ratha Yatra during Janmashtami.\n\n**Outside India**\n\nAbout eighty percent of the population of Nepal identify themselves as Hindus and celebrate Krishna Janmashtami. They observe Janmashtami by fasting until midnight. It is a national holiday in Nepal. The devotees recite the Bhagavad Gita and sing religious songs called bhajans and kirtans. The temples of Krishna are decorated. Shops, posters, and houses carry Krishna motifs.\n\n**Bangladesh**\n\nJanmashtami is a national holiday in Bangladesh. On Janmashtami, a procession starts from Dhakeshwari Temple in Dhaka, the National Temple of Bangladesh, and then proceeds through the streets of Old Dhaka. The procession dates back to 1902, but was stopped in 1948. The procession was resumed in 1989.\n\n**Fiji**\n\nAt least a quarter of the population in Fiji practices Hinduism, and this holiday has been celebrated in Fiji since the first Indian indentured laborers landed there. Janmashtami in Fiji is known as \"Krishna Ashtami.\" Most Hindus in Fiji have ancestors that originated from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Tamil Nadu, making this an especially important festival for them. Fiji's Janmashtami celebrations are unique in that they last for eight days, leading up to the eighth day, the day Krishna was born. During these eight days, Hindus gather at homes and at temples with their 'mandalis,' or devotional groups at evenings and night, and recite the Bhagavat Purana, sing devotional songs for Krishna, and distribute Prasadam.\n\n**Pakistan**\n\nJanmashtami is celebrated by Pakistani Hindus in the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Karachi with the singing of bhajans and delivering of sermons on Krishna. It is an optional holiday in Pakistan. Prior to the Partition of India, Dera Ghazi Khan was the center of a Janmashtami fair at the thallā of Kevalarāma. This fair is now recreated in Inder Puri, New Delhi.\n\n**Others**\n\nIn Arizona, United States, Governor Janet Napolitano was the first American leader to greet a message on Janmashtami, while acknowledging ISKCON. The festival is also celebrated widely by Krishnaites in the Caribbean countries of Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, and Suriname. Many Kriahnaites and Hindus in these countries originate from Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, and Orissa.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Krishna_Janmashtami\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe meaning of the Sanskrit word Janmashtami can be understood by splitting it into the two words, \"Janma\" and \"Ashtami.\" The word \"Janma\" means birth [11] and the word \"Ashtami\" means eight; thus, Krishna Janmashtami is the celebration of Krishna's birth on the eighth day of the dark fortnight (Krishna Paksha) in the month of Bhadrapada (August–September) [12] [13]\n\n\nHistory\nInformation about Krishna's life is noted in the Mahabharata, the Puranas, and Bhagavata Purana Krishna is the eighth son of Devaki (mother) and Vasudeva (father) [5]  Surrounding the time of his birth, persecution was rampant, freedoms were being denied, and King Kamsa's life was threatened [14] Krishna was born within a prison in Mathura, India where his parents were constrained by his uncle, Kamsa [5] During Devaki's wedding, Kamsa was warned by a celestial voice that Devaki's eighth son would be the cause of his death [5] In an effort to defy this prophesy, Kamsa imprisoned his sister Devaki and her husband and promptly killed the first six of her newborns after their birth [5] The guards responsible for keeping watch over Devaki's cell fell asleep and the cell doors were miraculously opened at the time of Krishna's birth [5] These events allowed Vasudeva to send Krishna across the Yamuna River to his foster parents, Yashoda (mother) and Nanda (father) [5] This legend is celebrated on Janmashtami by people keeping fasts, singing devotional songs of love for Krishna, and keeping a vigil into the night [15]\n\n\nObservance and celebrations\nKrishna Janmashtami holds significant importance to Krishnaites as well as Hindus around the world, and it is celebrated in diverse forms depending on their regional and cultural customs [17] [6] Hindus celebrate Janmashtami by fasting, singing, praying together, preparing and sharing special food, night vigils, and visiting Krishna or Vishnu temples The places of Mathura and Vrindavan are visited by pilgrims [10] Some mandirs organize recitation of Bhagavad Gita in the days leading up to Janmashtami [18] Many northern Indian communities organize dance-drama events called Rasa Lila or Krishna Lila [15] The tradition of Rasa Lila is particularly popular in the Mathura region, in northeastern states of India such as Manipur and Assam, and in parts of Rajasthan and Gujarat It is acted out by numerous teams of amateur artists, cheered on by their local communities, and these drama-dance plays begin a few days before each Janmashtami [19] [20] People decorate their houses with flowers and light [21] On this day, people chant \"Hare Krishna hare Krishna, Krishna- Krishna Hare Hare\" The Janmashtami celebration is followed by Dahi Handi, which is celebrated the next day [22] [23]\n\n\nNorthern India\nJanmashtami is the largest festival in the Braj region of north India, in cities such as Mathura where Krishna was born according to Krishnaism, and in Vrindavan where he grew up [15] Vaishnava communities in these cities in Uttar Pradesh, as well as others in the state, as well as locations in Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Himalayan north celebrate Janmashtami Krishna temples are decorated and lighted up, they attract numerous visitors on the day, while Krishna devotees hold bhakti events and keep night vigil [24]\n\n\nJammu Region\nIn Jammu region, Janmashtami is popularly known by the name \"Thogre/Thakure da Vrat\" [28] (meaning Vrat dedicated to Thakur i.e Shri Krishna) Observing a Phalaahari Vrat for complete one day is the major ritual in the festival The day is marked by numerous Phalaahari Dhaams or Bhandaras in the streets of Jammu region's prominent towns.\n\n\nKashmir\nJanmashtami is celebrated as Zaram Satam (Janam Saptami) by the native Kashmiri Pandits of Kashmir The festival is associated with observing a vrat the whole day and visiting the Thokur Kuth (Krishna Mandir) at midnight At night, puja is performed in the temples which includes performing abhishek (ritual bath) to the murti of Krishna, and singing bhajans (devotional songs) Food items appropriate for fasting, such as gaer or singhada lapsi (made from waterchestnut flour), fruits, and dried fruits are consumed on this day [30]\n\n\nMaharashtra\nJanmashtami (popularly known as \"Dahi Handii\" in Maharashtra) is celebrated in cities such as Mumbai, Latur, Nagpur and Pune [6] It is a celebration of joy and facilitator of social oneness [6] Dahi Handi is an enactment of how Krishna, during his childhood, would steal butter [31] This story is the theme of numerous reliefs on temples across India, as well as literature and dance-drama repertoire, symbolizing the joyful innocence of children, that love and life's play is the manifestation of god [32] [33]\n\n\nGujarat and Rajasthan\nIn Dwarka, Gujarat – where Krishna is believed to have established his kingdom – people celebrate the festival with a tradition similar to Dahi Handi, called Makhan Handi (pot with freshly churned butter) Others perform folk dances such and garba and raas, sing bhajans, and visit Krishna temples such as at the Dwarkadhish Temple or Nathdwara In the Kutch district region, farmers decorate their bullock carts and take out Krishna processions, with group singing and dancing [37] The day is of special

{"title": "Electoral_fraud_in_the_United_States", "content": "\nFrequency\nElectoral fraud is extremely rare in the United States [20] and often accidental when it occurs [21] [22] Fraud is more likely to occur in and affect the outcome of local elections, where the potential impact of a small number of votes can be greater [7] [23] [24] [25] \nSome experts have said voter fraud can be difficult to prove, [30] depending on the circumstances, [31] [32] though experts consider widespread cheating easy to detect [33] [34]\n\n\nNationwide databases\nIn 2012, News21, an Arizona State University journalism project, published a database of 2,068 alleged electoral fraud cases reported between 2000 and 2012 [35] This represented about 0.000003 cases for every vote cast 46 percent of cases also resulted in acquittals, dropped charges or decisions not to bring charges [36] News21 gathered the information by sending public records requests to elections officials and prosecutors, and was not able to obtain data from all [quantify] jurisdictions in the United States [35] The database also includes instances of voter intimidation [37]\n\n\nVoter impersonation\nVoter impersonation, or in-person voter fraud, is extremely rare [52] Between 1978 and 2018, no elections were overturned by courts due to voter impersonation fraud [53] Cases of voter impersonation are often difficult to prove [54] [55]\n\n\nMail-in ballot fraud\nWhile quite rare, experts say fraud occurs more often with mailed-in votes than with in-person voting [84] Between 1978 and 2018, at least fourteen elections were invalidated or overturned by courts due to absentee ballot fraud, twelve of which were at the local level (for such offices as county clerk, sheriff, judge, and mayor) [53]\n\n\nNoncitizen voting\nIllegal voting by noncitizens is extremely rare [120] This is due in part to the more severe penalties associated with the practice including deportation, up to five years of incarceration or fines, as well as the jeopardizing of naturalization efforts [121] [122] [123]\n\n\nDouble voting\nDouble voting is considered extremely rare [168] When someone votes twice within the same state, it is often inadvertent, for example if a voter thinks their absentee ballot will not be delivered in time [169] As of 2023, the only system that can detect double voting across states is the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), which close to half of states participate in [170]\n\n\nFelony voting\nIn the United States, depending on the state, a person may have their voting rights suspended or withdrawn due to the conviction of a criminal offense, usually a felony Felons who cast a ballot in those states often do not know that they were ineligible to vote [174]\n\n\nVoter registration\nBetween 2000 and 2012, News21 found 393 cases of alleged voter registration fraud across 34 states, many of which were linked to third-party voter registration groups such as ACORN This fraud can include registering fake names, regardless of whether anyone votes under those names [2]\n\n\nRegistering fake names\nBetween 2000 and 2012, News21 found 393 cases of alleged voter registration fraud across 34 states, many of which were linked to third-party voter registration groups such as ACORN This fraud can include registering fake names, regardless of whether anyone votes under those names [2]\n\n\nOutdated voter registration\nOutdated voter registration has not been linked to voter fraud despite allegations connecting the two [180] A 2012 report by the Pew Center on the States based on data collected in 2008, found that over 1.8 million dead people were registered to vote nationwide and over 3 million voters were registered in multiple states [181] [180] According to PolitiFact, the study investigated \"outdated voter rolls, not fraudulent votes\" [180] In an October 2016 Associated Press fact-check, the author noted these voter registration irregularities left some people concerned that the electoral system was vulnerable to the impersonation of dead voters However, voter rolls with dead voters are usually due to the states being slow to eliminate dead voters By 2016, most states had addressed concerns raised by the Pew 2012 report [182] As of October 2024, Michigan had one of the most bloated voter rolls in the nation, with 500,000 more registered voters than citizens of voting age This has not been connected to fraud, and is caused in part by federal laws restricting the removal of inactive voters [183]\n\n\nVote buying\nVote buying is illegal in the United States at the federal level if money is promised to certain individuals to vote or register to vote, though at the state level, most states only criminalize paying people to vote [185] Promising cash payments to a large number of voters is legal [186] Courts have also historically considered providing free transport to voters legally permissible [187]\n\n\nOther types\nA type of fraud that sometimes occurs is falsification of signatures on nominating petitions or ballot initiatives [196] [197] Experts say that as the cost of gathering paid signatures goes up, there is a greater incentive for fraud [198]\n\n\nNotable cases\nAccording to University of Kentucky professor Tracy Campbell, author of the 2005 book Deliver the Vote: A History of Election Fraud, an American Political Tradition—1742-2004, electoral fraud has historically been \"deeply embedded\" in American political culture [9] [10] [204]\n\n\n19th century\nElectoral fraud was prevalent in the United States during the 19th century, when safeguards against fraud and electioneering were considerably weaker, and political machines wielded significantly more power Political parties would produce their own ballots, and as of the mid-19th century, seven states still conducted elections by voice voting States only began to adopt the secret ballot in the 1880s and 1890s [8]\n\n\n20th century\nElectoral fraud caused some notable United States elections in the 20th century to be affected or annulled Since 1913, four United States Senate races were overturned by the Senate after the losing candidate challenged the outcome [219]\n\n\n21st century\nIn the 21st century, there have been scattered examples of electoral fraud affecting the outcome of elections, and attempts at widespread electoral fraud are notable when they occur at all [39] [247] Fraud was alleged [relevant?] by losing candidates in several major close elections, including the 2004 Washington gubernatorial election, [248] the 2008 United States Senate election in Minnesota [249] [250] and most notably, the 2020 United States presidential election, [251] but nothing that would account for the margin of victory was proven in court.\n\n\nPublic perception\nA 2021 study found that Republicans and Democrats often define voter fraud differently, with Republicans more likely to define voter fraud as stemming from individual actions whereas Democrats are more likely to point to voter suppression from unfair policies [266]\n\n\nFalse and unproven claims\nFalse claims of electoral fraud have occurred numerous times in United States history, often with the intention of voter suppression Exaggerated claims of noncitizen voter fraud date back to the 1800s and usually spike after periods of higher nonwhite immigration [139] According to Harvard professor Alexander Keyssar, voter fraud allegations in the 19th century were usually made by conservative Protestants against newly arrived immigrants; and while there was more to justify fraud claims back then, they were often exaggerated and used to justify restrictive voting laws [12] In 1807, New Jersey ended the rights of women to vote with the excuse that men were supposedly dressing as women and voting twice In 1959, Washington Parish, Louisiana purged 85% of the parish's African American voters despite claiming they were only removing illegal names [280]\n\n\nHistory\nFalse claims of electoral fraud have occurred numerous times in United States history, often with the intention of voter suppression Exaggerated claims

purged 85% of the parish's African American voters despite claiming they were only removing illegal names [280]\n\n\n2004 presidential election\nAfter the 2004 presidential election, many blogs published false rumors claiming to show evidence that voter fraud had prevented Democrat John Kerry from winning [282] [275] Unfounded conspiracy theories about the election were circulated and promoted [275] Proponents argued the election was stolen, arguing that votes were switched from Democratic to Republican, that \"phantom voters\" voted in Ohio, that exit polls that favored Kerry were \"more accurate\" than the actual result, [283] and that voting machines were rigged to favor Republican George W Bush [284] As a result of this, some Democratic members of Congress asked for investigations into the vote count [283]\n\n\nClaims by Donald Trump\nPresident Donald Trump continued to claim without evidence that between 3 and 5 million people cost him the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by voting illegally [288] [289] [290] [291] [292]\n\n\n2016 presidential election\nPresident Donald Trump continued to claim without evidence that between 3 and 5 million people cost him the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by voting illegally [288] [289] [290] [291] [292]\n\n\nVoter fraud commission (2017)\nOn May 11, 2017, Trump signed an executive order to establish a commission to conduct an investigation into voter fraud, chaired by Vice President Mike Pence with Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach as vice chair [293] Kobach and the commission failed to provide evidence for claims of voter fraud by Trump and others on the commission [294] Trump's creation of the commission was criticized by voting rights advocates, scholars and experts, and newspaper editorial boards as a pretext for, and prelude to, voter suppression [295] [296] [297] [298] [294] Matt Dunlap, a Democrat on the commission, called it a sham designed to gin up anti-immigrant sentiment [13]\n\n\n2020 presidential election\nDuring the 2020 presidential campaign, Trump indicated in Twitter posts, interviews and speeches that he might refuse to recognize the outcome of the election if he were defeated; Trump falsely suggested that the election would be rigged against him [301] [302] [303] Trump repeatedly claimed that \"the only way\" he could lose would be if the election was \"rigged\" and repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transition of power after the election [304] [305] Trump also attacked mail-in voting throughout the campaign, falsely claiming that the practice contained high rates of fraud [306] [307] [308] In September 2020, FBI Director Christopher A Wray, a Trump appointee, testified under oath that the FBI has \"not seen, historically, any kind of coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election, whether it's by mail or otherwise.\" [309]\n\n\n2024 presidential election\nTrump's claims of fraud have continued into the 2024 presidential campaign, with experts and election officials have voiced concern about rising threats and violence inspired by Trump's election denialism since 2020 [319] [329] Richard Hasen wrote that in January 2024 that, \"Trump has been able to manufacture doubt out of absolutely nothing; fraud claims untethered to reality still captivate millions of people looking for an excuse as to why their adored candidate may have lost.\" [330] Walter Olson of the Cato Institute said that Trump's agitations about election security and noncitizen voting are due to \"his need to keep up the illusion that he somehow won.\" [331]\n\n\nMisinformation and disinformation\nSciences Po academic Jérôme Viala-Gaudefroy suggests that right-wing politicians and organizations promote the narrative of electoral fraud out of political or financial self-interest that taps into political paranoia that he traces to McCarthyism, the great replacement and the deep state [340] [341] Jon Schwarz of The Intercept lists examples of false voter fraud claims from Republicans going back decades [342] Mindy Romero of USC said the concern of noncitizens voting is fueled by misinformation, fear and demonization of immigrants [343] Voter fraud expert Lorraine Minnite has described Republicans as seizing on misunderstandings of complicated processes around voter roll maintenance to suggest that noncitizens were voting [115] Some claims of voter fraud are described as a dog whistle [344] [345] [346] [347] [348]\n\n\nBy foreign actors\nRussian operatives have promoted false claims of voter fraud hoping to \"further sow doubt in election integrity\" [353] in the United States and democracies around the world [354] According to a US intelligence report in September 2020, Russian intelligence operatives were trying to amplify concerns of US election integrity such as the reliability of mail-in voting [355] According to the New York Times, disinformation efforts by autocratic countries led by Russia and China \"push narratives undermining democratic governance\" designed to \"accelerate the recent rise in authoritarian-minded leaders.\" [349] Russia's Internet Research Agency focused voter fraud memes at right-wing groups, with its most-shared Facebook post of the 2016 United States elections reading \"Like if you think only US citizens should be allowed vote\" while showing a photo of Latinos waiting in line [356]\n\n\nRelationship to other election issues\nIn some cases, the spreading of fraud claims is done to lay the groundwork for overturning election results [357] [358] [359] The 2020 presidential election saw a number of failed attempts to overturn the results based on unfounded claims of voter fraud [360] [361] The 2024 presidential election has seen similar claims, which some experts have warned could be seeds planted in case Trump loses and tries to overturn the result [362] [363] [131] The New York Times cited Georgia as the most likely state for this to occur in due to recent changes in election laws [363] [335]\n\n\nAttempts to overturn election results\nIn some cases, the spreading of fraud claims is done to lay the groundwork for overturning election results [357] [358] [359] The 2020 presidential election saw a number of failed attempts to overturn the results based on unfounded claims of voter fraud [360] [361] The 2024 presidential election has

state for this to occur in due to recent changes in election laws [363] [335]\n\n\nConfidence in elections\nFalse claims of fraud have lowered overall levels of trust in elections [364] According to the New York Times, \"baseless claims of electoral fraud have battered trust in democracy\" [349] For the 2024 elections, Rick Hasen was most worried about election denialism which can lead to violence and erode trust in democracy [365] A nationwide study conducted after the 2018 United States elections and published in the Journal of Experimental Political Science found that exposure to claims of voter fraud reduces confidence in electoral integrity, though does not reduce support for democracy itself Corrective messages from mainstream sources did not measurably reduce this distrust [366]\n\n\nPolitical violence and threats\nThe combination of false claims about electoral fraud and violent, warlike rhetoric has been noted to raise the likelihood of election workers receiving threats, as well as political violence such as the unprecedented January 6 attacks [367] [332] [360] [368] Some election experts worry that Trump's voters would resort to violence again in 2024 if he lost the election [369] [119] In September, Trump threatened to jail people \"involved in unscrupulous behavior\" in the 2024 election, prompting widespread condemnation from election officials that it could provoke violence, including against election workers [370] [329]\n\n\nVoter intimidation\nWhile voter intimidation has been relatively rare, it has increased since 2020 with the false claims of fraud and concerted efforts to recruit poll watchers [374] In 2020, Donald Trump encouraged his supporters to go to the polls and \"watch very carefully\" [17] CNBC cited voter intimidation as a bigger concern for analysts than voter fraud ahead of the 2020 elections [17] According to The Washington Post, voting rights advocates worry that the rhetoric about noncitizen voting could have a 'chilling effect' on Latino citizens and naturalized immigrants exercising their right to vote [375] In Arizona in 2022, there were instances of people surveilling drop boxes and taking photos of people's license plates [374] Some bills passed in Republican states also increase the likelihood of voter intimidation and election interference at polling stations [376]\n\n\nVoter suppression and turnout\nConcerns about voter fraud, despite the fact that it is essentially nonexistent, are used as a main justification for voter suppression bills in the 21st century [376] The bills passed by Republicans in state legislatures restrict voting access more for minorities, young people, and other Democratic-leaning constituencies For example, sponsors of the bills often cite the false claim that Democrats had stolen the 2020 election through voter fraud [376]\n\n\nPrevention\nStates each have different laws and methods to address electoral fraud Some methods of preventing voter fraud have caused controversy due to their potential to disproportionately impact legal voters and/or certain demographic groups [378]\n\n\nVoter ID laws\nIn the United States, voter ID laws (laws requiring identification to vote) have been enacted in 36 states as of 2024 with the stated aim of preventing voter impersonation [380] They have mostly been introduced by Republican legislators since 2011 [381] [56] [60] Specific forms of ID required vary between states, with some requiring photo identification [382] Some laws have been struck down in court as an undue burden [380]\n\n\nCitizenship verification\nThe process of verifying the citizenship of voters varies by state [124] [127] It is best practice for states to check registrations against DMV or Social Security files to check for noncitizens [106] Some methods states have tried have been discontinued due to errors or legal fights As of 2020, some states like Kansas do not independently verify proof of citizenship [124] [needs update]\n\n\nProof of citizenship laws\nProof of citizenship laws require people who vote or register to vote to present documentary proof of citizenship Proponents have argued that they are necessary to prevent illegal noncitizen voting, while critics have said that noncitizen voting essentially does not occur and that the laws would disenfranchise large percentages of eligible voters who lack easy access to such documents, such as college students, tribal voters, or low-income voters [392] [393] [394] A June 2024 Brennan Center study estimates that 21.3 million citizens (9% of voters) do not have easy access to documentary proof of citizenship, and that 3.8 million citizens lack access to any form, often because documents were lost, damaged or stolen [394] [395] [396] [397] [398] [399] [400]\n\n\nSignature verification\nSignature verification is carried out by a majority of states in order to prevent forged paper ballots According to the Election Administration and Voting Survey, 27.5% of rejected absentee ballots in 2016 [413] and 15.8% of rejected mail-in ballots in 2018 [414] were due to signature mismatches Tossing ballots due to signature mismatches can depend on the method of signature verification used [415]\n\n\nElection audits\nAs of 2024, 48 states conduct some type of post-election audit, which check if the equipment and procedures used to count votes worked properly, and detect discrepancies using a hand count of paper records The two exceptions are Alabama and New Hampshire, both of which nonetheless piloted different audit types in 2022 The type and scope of audit significantly varies between states [419]\n\n\nVoter roll management\nVoter caging is the process of challenging the voter registration status of someone who is registered to vote It often involves sending that person a postcard to the address on file and removing the voter if they do not respond within a certain time period [420] The practice can be controversial with some civil rights groups successfully suing some states that target voters of a particular political party or race in such a way as to make it meaningfully impact election outcomes and voter's rights [421]\n\n\nVoter roll purges\nVoter caging is the process of challenging the voter registration status of someone who is registered to vote It often involves sending that person a postcard to the address on file and removing the voter if they do not respond within a certain time period [420] The practice can be controversial with some civil rights groups successfully suing some states that target voters of a particular political party or race in such a way as to make it meaningfully impact election outcomes and voter's rights [421]\n\n\nInterstate databases\nThe Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck Program was a database established in 2005 and run by Kansas that compared voting records across multiple states to prevent double voting At least 28 states opted into the program, but academics and several states found that it returned high rates of false positives that would disenfranchise legal voters Some states left as a result [422] In 2017, the program was put on hold after the Department of Homeland Security discovered security vulnerabilities In 2019, the program was indefinitely suspended as part of a settlement of a class-action lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union [423]\n\n\nProsecution\nIn most states, a prosecutor must prove that an individual committed voter fraud intentionally or knowingly In some states, however, any mistake on the part of a voter that leads to voting illegally can be grounds for prosecution [428] An election crime becomes a federal crime if the ballot includes one or more federal candidates, an election official is involved, election workers are threatened, or the crime relates to fraudulent voter registration or noncitizen voting The Federal Bureau of Investigation defines voter fraud as one of three broad categories of federal election crimes; the other two being campaign finance violations and civil rights violations (such as voter intimidation or suppression) [429]\n\n\nStanding in lawsuits\nIn the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, many courts ruled against plaintiffs in voter fraud lawsuits on the basis that they, as voters, lacked standing According to University of Memphis law professor Steven Mulroy, who was critical of some court dismissals based on standing, election cases raise unique standing challenges as the asserted harms are often split between many people [440] A novel type of vote dilution claim based on fraud has been employed by Republicans since 2020, and is based on the idea that election rules that make it too easy to cast fraudulent votes can dilute the strength of valid ones [441] Claims of this nature were not successful in 2020 though have since received some success in federal district courts [442]\n\n\nReferences\nExtremely rare [78] [79]\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Electoral Fraud in the United States\n\nElectoral fraud in the United States is a rare occurrence, and most instances are accidental when they do happen. However, the potential impact of a small number of votes can be greater in local elections. Experts consider widespread cheating easy to detect, but voter fraud can be difficult to prove, depending on the circumstances.\n\nNationwide databases\n\nIn 2012, a database of 2,068 alleged electoral fraud cases was published by News21, an Arizona State University journalism project. This represented about 0.000003 cases for every vote cast. The database included instances of voter intimidation and was gathered by sending public records requests to elections officials and prosecutors. However, the project was not able to obtain data from all jurisdictions in the United States.\n\nVoter impersonation\n\nVoter impersonation, or in-person voter fraud, is extremely rare. Between 1978 and 2018, no elections were overturned by courts due to voter impersonation fraud. Cases of voter impersonation are often difficult to prove. Mail-in ballot fraud is more likely to occur than in-person voting. Between 1978 and 2018, at least 14 elections were invalidated or overturned by courts due to absentee ballot fraud, 12 of which were at the local level.\n\nNoncitizen voting\n\nIllegal voting by noncitizens is extremely rare. This is due in part to the more severe penalties associated with the practice, including deportation, up to five years of incarceration, or fines. Double voting is considered extremely rare. When someone votes twice within the same state, it is often inadvertent, such as if a voter thinks their absentee ballot will not be delivered in time.\n\nFelony voting\n\nIn the United States, depending on the state, a person may have their voting rights suspended or withdrawn due to the conviction of a criminal offense, usually a felony. Felons who cast a ballot in those states often do not know that they were ineligible to vote.\n\nVoter registration\n\nBetween 2000 and 2012, News21 found 393 cases of alleged voter registration fraud across 34 states, many of which were linked to third-party voter registration groups such as ACORN. Fraud can include registering fake names, regardless of whether anyone votes under those names.\n\nOutdated voter registration\n\nOutdated voter registration has not been linked to voter fraud, despite allegations connecting the two. A 2012 report found that over 1.8 million dead people were registered to vote nationwide and over 3 million voters were registered in multiple states. However, this is due to states being slow to eliminate dead voters, and most states have addressed concerns raised by the report.\n\nVote buying\n\nVote buying is illegal in the United States at the federal level if money is promised to certain individuals to vote or register to vote. However, at the state level, most states only criminalize paying people to vote. Promising cash payments to a large number of voters is legal, and courts have considered providing free transport to voters legally permissible.\n\nNotable cases\n\nElectoral fraud has been a part of American political culture, with instances of fraud dating back to the 19th century. During the 19th century, electoral safeguards were weaker, and political machines wielded more power. The 20th century saw notable elections affected or annulled due to electoral fraud. In the 21st century, scattered examples of electoral fraud affecting election outcomes have occurred, and attempts at widespread electoral fraud are notable when they occur.\n\nPublic perception\n\nA 2021 study found that Republicans and Democrats often define voter fraud differently. Republicans are more likely to define voter fraud as stemming from individual actions, whereas Democrats are more likely to point to voter suppression from unfair policies.\n\nFalse and unproven claims\n\nFalse claims of electoral fraud have occurred numerous times in United States history, often with the intention of voter suppression. Exaggerated claims of noncitizen voter fraud date back to the 1800s and usually spike after periods of higher nonwhite immigration.\n\nHistory\n\nFalse claims of electoral fraud have occurred numerous times in United States history, often with the intention of voter suppression. Exaggerated claims of noncitizen voter fraud date back to the 1800s and usually spike after periods of higher nonwhite immigration. In the 19th century, conservative Protestants often made allegations of noncitizen voting against newly arrived immigrants. While there was more to justify fraud claims back then, they were often exaggerated and used to justify restrictive voting laws.\n\n2004 presidential election\n\nAfter the 2004 presidential election, many blogs published false rumors claiming to show evidence that voter fraud had prevented Democrat John Kerry from winning. Unfounded conspiracy theories about the election were circulated and promoted, with proponents arguing the election was stolen, arguing that votes were switched from Democratic to Republican, that \"phantom voters\" voted in Ohio, that exit polls that favored Kerry were \"more accurate\" than the actual result, and that voting machines were rigged to favor Republican George W Bush.\n\nClaims by Donald Trump\n\nPresident Donald Trump continued to claim without evidence that between 3 and 5 million people cost him the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by voting illegally. Trump's claims of fraud have continued into the 2024 presidential campaign, with experts and election officials voicing concern about rising threats and violence inspired by Trump's election denialism since 2020.\n\nMisinformation and disinformation\n\nRight-wing politicians and organizations promote the narrative of electoral fraud out of political or financial self-interest, tapping into political paranoia that is rooted in McCarthyism, the great replacement, and the deep state.

more often with mailed-in votes than with in-person voting [84] Between 1978 and 2018, at least fourteen elections were invalidated or overturned by courts due to absentee ballot fraud, twelve of which were at the local level (for such offices as county clerk, sheriff, judge, and mayor) [53]\n\n\nNoncitizen voting\nIllegal voting by noncitizens is extremely rare [120] This is due in part to

has not been linked to voter fraud despite allegations connecting the two [180] A 2012 report by the Pew Center on the States based on data collected in 2008, found that over 1.8 million dead people were registered to vote nationwide and over 3 million voters were registered in multiple states [181] [180] According to PolitiFact, the study investigated \"outdated voter rolls, not fraudulent votes\" [180] In an October 2016 Associated Press fact-check, the author noted these voter registration irregularities left some people concerned that the electoral system was vulnerable to the impersonation of dead voters However, voter rolls with dead voters are usually due to the states being slow to eliminate dead voters By 2016, most states had addressed concerns raised by the Pew 2012 report [182] As of October 2024, Michigan had one of the most bloated voter rolls in the nation, with 500,000 more registered voters than citizens of voting age This has not been connected to fraud,

certain individuals to vote or register to vote, though at the state level, most states only criminalize paying people to vote [185] Promising cash payments to a large number of voters is legal [186] Courts have also historically considered providing free transport to voters legally permissible [187]\n\n\nOther types\nA type of fraud that sometimes occurs is falsification of signatures on nominating petitions or ballot initiatives [196] [197] Experts say that as the cost of gathering paid signatures goes up, there is a greater incentive for fraud [198]\n\n\nNotable cases\nAccording to University of Kentucky professor Tracy Campbell, author of the 2005 book Deliver the Vote: A History of Election Fraud, an American Political Tradition—1742-2004, electoral fraud has historically been \"deeply embedded\" in American political culture [9] [10] [204]\n\n\n19th century\nElectoral fraud was prevalent in the United States during the 19th century, when safeguards against fraud and electioneering were considerably weaker, and political machines wielded significantly more power Political parties would produce their own ballots, and as of the mid-19th century, seven states still conducted elections by voice voting States only began to adopt the secret ballot in the 1880s and 1890s [8]\n\n\n20th century\nElectoral fraud caused some notable United States elections in the 20th century to be affected or annulled Since 1913, four United States Senate races were overturned by the Senate after the losing candidate challenged the outcome [219]\n\n\n21st century\nIn the 21st century, there have been scattered examples of electoral fraud affecting the outcome of elections, and attempts at widespread electoral fraud are notable when they occur at all [39] [247] Fraud was alleged [relevant?] by losing candidates in several major close elections, including the 2004 Washington gubernatorial election, [248] the 2008 United States Senate election in Minnesota [249] [250]

commission (2017)\nOn May 11, 2017, Trump signed an executive order to establish a commission to conduct an investigation into voter fraud, chaired by Vice President Mike Pence with Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach as vice chair [293] Kobach and the commission failed to provide evidence for claims of voter fraud by Trump and others on the commission [294] Trump's creation of the commission was criticized by voting rights advocates, scholars and experts, and newspaper editorial boards as a pretext for, and prelude to, voter suppression [295] [296] [297] [298] [294] Matt Dunlap, a

repeatedly claimed that \"the only way\" he could lose would be if the election was \"rigged\" and repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transition of power after the election [304] [305] Trump also attacked mail-in voting throughout the campaign, falsely claiming that the practice contained high rates of fraud [306] [307] [308] In September 2020, FBI Director Christopher A Wray, a Trump

presidential election\nTrump's claims of fraud have continued into the 2024 presidential campaign, with experts and election officials have voiced concern about rising threats and violence inspired by Trump's election denialism since 2020 [319] [329] Richard Hasen wrote that in January 2024 that, \"Trump has been able to manufacture doubt out of absolutely nothing; fraud claims untethered to reality still captivate millions of people looking for an excuse as to why their adored candidate may have lost.\" [330] Walter Olson of the Cato Institute said that Trump's agitations about election security and noncitizen voting are due to \"his need to keep up the illusion that he somehow won.\" [331]\n\n\nMisinformation and disinformation\nSciences Po academic Jérôme Viala-Gaudefroy suggests that right-wing politicians and organizations promote the narrative of electoral fraud out of political or financial self-interest that taps into political paranoia that he traces to McCarthyism, the great replacement and the deep state [340] [341] Jon Schwarz of The Intercept lists examples of false voter fraud claims from Republicans going back decades [342] Mindy Romero of USC said the concern of noncitizens voting is fueled by misinformation, fear and demonization of immigrants [343] Voter fraud expert Lorraine Minnite has described Republicans as seizing on misunderstandings of complicated processes around voter roll maintenance to suggest that noncitizens were voting [115] Some claims of voter fraud are described as a dog whistle [344] [345] [346] [347] [348]\n\n\nBy foreign actors\nRussian operatives have promoted false claims of voter fraud hoping to \"further sow doubt in election integrity\" [353] in the United States and democracies around the world [354] According to a US intelligence report in September 2020, Russian intelligence operatives were trying to amplify concerns of US election integrity such as the reliability of mail-in voting [355] According to the New York Times, disinformation efforts by autocratic countries led by Russia and China \"push narratives undermining democratic governance\" designed to \"accelerate the recent rise in authoritarian-minded leaders.\" [349] Russia's Internet Research Agency focused voter fraud memes at right-wing groups, with its most-shared Facebook post of the 2016 United States elections reading \"Like if you think only US citizens should be allowed vote\" while showing a photo of Latinos waiting in line [356]\n\n\nRelationship to other election issues\nIn some cases, the spreading of fraud claims is done to lay the groundwork for overturning election results [357] [358] [359] The 2020 presidential election saw a number of failed attempts to overturn the results based on unfounded claims of voter fraud [360] [361] The 2024 presidential election has seen similar claims, which some experts have warned could be seeds planted in case Trump loses and tries to overturn the result [362] [363] [131] The New York Times cited Georgia as the most likely state for this to occur in due to recent changes in election laws [363] [335]\n\n\nAttempts to overturn election results\nIn some cases, the spreading of fraud claims is done to lay the groundwork for overturning election results [357] [358] [359] The 2020 presidential election saw a number of failed attempts to overturn the results based on unfounded claims of voter fraud [360] [361] The 2024 presidential election has seen similar claims, which some experts have warned could be seeds planted in case Trump loses and tries to overturn the result [362] [363] [131] The New York Times cited Georgia as the most likely state for this to occur in due to recent changes in election laws [363] [335]\n\n\nConfidence in elections\nFalse claims of fraud have lowered overall levels of trust in elections [364] According to the New York Times, \"baseless claims of electoral fraud have battered trust in democracy\" [349] For the 2024 elections, Rick Hasen was most worried about election denialism which can lead to violence and erode trust in democracy [365] A nationwide study conducted after the 2018 United States elections and published in the Journal of Experimental Political Science found that exposure to claims of voter fraud reduces confidence in electoral integrity, though does not reduce support for democracy itself Corrective messages from mainstream sources did not measurably reduce this distrust [366]\n\n\nPolitical violence and threats\nThe combination of false claims about electoral fraud and violent, warlike rhetoric has been noted to raise the likelihood of election workers receiving threats, as well as political violence such as the unprecedented January 6 attacks [367] [332] [360] [368] Some election experts worry that Trump's voters would resort to violence again in 2024 if he lost the election [369] [119] In September, Trump threatened to jail people \"involved in unscrupulous behavior\" in the 2024 election, prompting widespread condemnation from election officials that it could provoke violence, including against election workers [370] [329]\n\n\nVoter intimidation\nWhile voter intimidation has been relatively rare, it has increased since 2020 with the false claims of fraud and concerted efforts to recruit poll watchers [374] In 2020, Donald Trump encouraged his supporters to go to the polls and \"watch very carefully\" [17] CNBC cited voter intimidation as a bigger concern for analysts than voter fraud ahead of the 2020 elections [17] According to The Washington Post, voting rights advocates worry that the rhetoric about noncitizen voting could have a 'chilling effect' on Latino citizens and naturalized immigrants exercising their right to vote [375] In Arizona in 2022, there were instances of people surveilling drop boxes and taking photos of people's license plates [374] Some bills passed in Republican states also increase the likelihood of voter intimidation and election interference at polling stations [376]\n\n\nVoter suppression and turnout\nConcerns about voter fraud, despite the fact that it is essentially nonexistent, are used as a main justification for voter suppression bills in the 21st century [376] The bills passed by Republicans in state legislatures restrict voting access more for minorities, young people, and other Democratic-leaning constituencies For example, sponsors of the bills often cite the false claim that Democrats had stolen the 2020 election through voter fraud [376]\n\n\nPrevention\nStates each have different laws and methods to address electoral fraud Some methods of preventing voter fraud have caused controversy due to their potential to disproportionately impact legal voters and/or certain demographic groups [378]\n\n\nVoter ID laws\nIn the United States, voter ID laws (laws requiring identification to vote) have been enacted in 36 states as of 2024 with the stated aim of preventing voter impersonation [380] They have mostly been introduced by Republican legislators since 2011 [381] [56] [60] Specific forms of ID required vary between states, with some requiring photo identification [382] Some laws have been struck down in court as an undue burden [380]\n\n\nCitizenship verification\nThe process of verifying the citizenship of voters varies by state [124] [127] It is best practice for states to check registrations against DMV or Social Security files to check for noncitizens [106] Some methods states have tried have been discontinued due to errors or legal fights As of 2020, some states like Kansas do not independently verify proof of citizenship [124] [needs update]\n\n\nProof of citizenship laws\nProof of citizenship laws require people who vote or register to vote to present documentary proof of citizenship Proponents have argued that they are necessary to prevent illegal noncitizen voting, while critics have said that noncitizen voting essentially does not occur and that the laws would disenfranchise large percentages of eligible voters who lack easy access to such documents, such as college students, tribal voters, or low-income voters [392] [393] [394] A June 2024 Brennan Center study estimates that 21.3 million citizens (9% of voters) do not have easy access to documentary proof of citizenship, and that 3.8 million citizens lack access to any form, often because documents were lost, damaged or stolen [394] [395] [396] [397] [398] [399] [400]\n\n\nSignature verification\nSignature verification is carried out by a majority of states in order to prevent forged paper ballots According to the Election Administration and Voting Survey, 27.5% of rejected absentee ballots in 2016 [413] and 15.8% of rejected mail-in ballots in 2018 [414] were due to signature mismatches Tossing ballots due to signature mismatches can depend on the method of signature verification used [415]\n\n\nElection audits\nAs of 2024, 48 states conduct some type of post-election audit, which check if the equipment and procedures used to count votes worked properly, and detect discrepancies using a hand count of paper records The two exceptions are Alabama and New Hampshire, both of which nonetheless piloted different audit types in 2022 The type and scope of audit significantly varies between states [419]\n\n\nVoter roll management\nVoter caging is the process of challenging the voter registration status of someone who is registered to vote It often involves sending that person a postcard to the address on file and removing the voter if they do not respond within a certain time period [420] The practice can be controversial with some civil rights groups successfully suing some states that target voters of a particular political party or race in such a way as to make it meaningfully impact election outcomes and voter's rights [421]\n\n\nVoter roll purges\nVoter caging is the process of challenging the voter registration status of someone who is registered to vote It often involves sending that person a postcard to the address on file and removing the voter if they do not respond within a certain time period [420] The practice can be controversial with some civil rights groups successfully suing some states that target voters of a particular political party or race in such a way as to make it meaningfully impact election outcomes and voter's rights [421]\n\n\nInterstate databases\nThe Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck Program was a database established in 2005 and run by Kansas that compared voting records across multiple states to prevent double voting At least 28 states opted into the program, but academics and several states found that it returned high rates of false positives that would disenfranchise legal voters Some states left as a result [422] In 2017, the program was put on hold after the Department of Homeland Security discovered security vulnerabilities In 2019, the program was indefinitely suspended as part of a settlement of a class-action lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union [423]\n\n\nProsecution\nIn most states, a prosecutor must prove that an individual committed voter fraud intentionally or knowingly In some states, however, any mistake on the part of a voter that leads to voting illegally can be grounds for prosecution [428] An election crime becomes a federal crime if the ballot includes one or more federal candidates, an election official is involved, election workers are threatened, or the crime relates to fraudulent voter registration or noncitizen voting The Federal Bureau of Investigation defines voter fraud as one of three broad categories of federal election crimes; the other two being campaign finance violations and civil rights violations (such as voter intimidation or suppression) [429]\n\n\nStanding in lawsuits\nIn the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, many courts ruled against plaintiffs in voter fraud lawsuits on the basis that they, as voters, lacked standing According to University of Memphis law professor Steven Mulroy, who was critical of some court dismissals based on standing, election cases raise unique standing challenges as the asserted harms are often split between many people [440] A novel type of vote dilution claim based on fraud has been employed by Republicans since 2020, and is based on the idea that election rules that make it too easy to cast fraudulent votes can dilute the strength of valid ones [441] Claims of this nature were not successful in 2020 though have since received some success in federal district courts [442]\n\n\nReferences\nExtremely rare [78] [79]\n\n\nExternal

The season premiered on September 22, 2021, and concluded on December 15, 2021. The season was filmed in Fiji, and featured 18 new castaways divided into three tribes: Luvu, Ua, and Yase.\n\n**Production**\n\nThis season was originally scheduled to start in March 2020, but was pushed back due to international travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The crew considered filming domestically in Georgia or Hawaii, but the unpredictability of the pandemic pushed filming back to 2021. On February 11, 2021, Faiyaz Koya, the Fijian Minister of Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport, approved filming for this season with the crew required to arrive in groups and quarantine before filming. On March 22, 2021, Jeff Probst announced on-location that production of this season was set to start, and filming finally began on April 15. The season debuted in September 2021.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe season was originally intended to have a more traditional format, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced the producers to make significant changes. The season introduced several new twists, including the \"Shot in the Dark\" which offered players at Tribal Council a chance for immunity in exchange for giving up one's vote, the \"Beware Advantage\" which restricted players' ability to vote until their immunity idols became active, and decision games which forced players to make game-altering choices. One such decision game featured players making opposing but not necessarily different choices to either risk or protect their votes in a manner similar to a game of Chicken. Other games of decision included the \"Hourglass\" twist which gave one player the opportunity to reverse the outcome of a group immunity challenge at the risk of earning tribemates' ire, and the \"Do or Die\" twist which, in one instance, made the first player to lose an Immunity Challenge perform a risky game of chance similar to the Monty Hall problem just to be able to stay in the game.\n\n**Contestants**\n\nThe cast was composed of 18 new players divided into three tribes: Luvu, Ua, and Yase. The tribe names come from the Fijian words for \"flood\", \"wave\", and \"lightning\" respectively. The merged tribe was named Viakana, which comes from the Fijian phrase for \"hungry\", was suggested by Erika Casupanan. Outside of Survivor, Danny McCray and Shan Smith competed on the first season of The Challenge: USA. In 2023, McCray competed on The Challenge: World Championship. Erika Casupanan competed on the first season of The Traitors Canada.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nEighteen new castaways were divided into three tribes of six: Luvu, Ua, and Yase. Luvu went undefeated in immunity challenges, while Yase got off to a rough start, losing the first two. Dominated by a women's alliance, they made up for the numbers deficit while Ua dwindled down to just Shan and Ricard. Their strong partnership enabled them to reach the merge, where they initially aligned with Luvu against the surviving Yase members. Liana turned against her old tribe to align with Danny, Deshawn, and Shan in a final four deal. However, Danny and Deshawn aligned with the others under Ricard and Erika's lead to take out a power player in Shan, busting the game open.\n\n**Episodes**\n\nThe 18 new castaways were welcomed by Jeff before being informed of their first challenge, as well as the fact that they would start with meager supplies. The season consisted of 13 episodes, each featuring a challenge, a Tribal Council, and a reward.\n\n**Voting History**\n\nThe season received a mixed response, with many praising the cast and their gameplay as well as the entertaining episodes and unpredictability of the season and Erika's win.

Since its release, GPT-3 has garnered significant attention for its ability to process and generate human-like text. The model has sparked both excitement and concern among experts and the general public. In this article, we will delve into the background, training, and capabilities of GPT-3, as well as its applications, reception, and criticism.\n\n**Background**\n\nAccording to The Economist, improved algorithms, more powerful computers, and a recent increase in the amount of digitized material have fueled a revolution in machine learning. New techniques in the 2010s resulted in \"rapid improvements in tasks\", including manipulating language.\n\n**Training and Capabilities**\n\nThe construct of \"learning styles\" is problematic because it fails to account for the processes through which learning styles are shaped. Some students might develop a particular learning style because they have had particular experiences, while others might develop a particular learning style by trying to accommodate to a learning environment that was not well suited to their learning needs. Ultimately, we need to understand the interactions among learning styles and environmental and personal factors, and how these shape how we learn and the kinds of learning we experience.\n\nGPT-3 models are trained on a massive corpus of text data, which allows them to learn patterns and relationships between words and concepts. The model's architecture is based on a transformer network, which enables it to process long-range dependencies in the input data. This allows GPT-3 to generate coherent and context-specific text.\n\n**GPT-3 Models**\n\nThere are many models in the GPT-3 family, some serving different purposes than others. In the initial research paper published by OpenAI, they mentioned 8 different sizes of the main GPT-3 model. These models vary in terms of their training data, architecture, and performance.\n\n**GPT-3.5**\n\nGenerative Pre-trained Transformer 3.5 (GPT-3.5) is a sub-class of GPT-3 models created by OpenAI in 2022.\n\n**Models**\n\nThere are three models:\n\n*   GPT-3.5 with browsing: This model was introduced on April 10, 2023, and is designed to access and browse online information. This has led to more accurate and up-to-date responses to user queries.\n*   InstructGPT: This is a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 trained on a dataset of human-written instructions.\n\n**Reception**\n\nGPT-3's builder, OpenAI, was initially founded as a non-profit in 2015.

OpenAI eventually released a version of GPT-2 that was 8% of the original model's size. In the same year, OpenAI restructured to be a for-profit company. In 2020, Microsoft announced the company had exclusive licensing of GPT-3 for Microsoft's products and services following a multi-billion dollar investment in OpenAI.\n\n**Applications**\n\nGPT-3 has various applications, including:\n\n*   Customer service: GPT-3 can be used to generate responses to customer inquiries, freeing up human customer support agents to focus on more complex issues.\n*   Content creation: GPT-3 can generate high-quality content, such as articles, social media posts, and product descriptions.\n*   Language translation: GPT-3 can be used to translate text from one language to another, facilitating communication across language barriers.\n*   Education: GPT-3 can be used to generate personalized learning materials, such as quizzes, exercises, and study guides.\n\n**Reviews**\n\nGPT-3 has received mixed reviews from experts and the general public. Some praise its ability to generate human-like text, while others express concerns about its potential to spread misinformation.\n\n**Criticism**\n\nGPT-3 has faced criticism for its potential to:\n\n*   Spread misinformation: GPT-3 can generate text that is indistinguishable from human-written text, which can lead to the spread of misinformation.\n*   Bias: GPT-3 can reflect the biases present in the training data, which can lead to discriminatory outcomes.\n*   Job displacement: GPT-3 has the potential to automate certain tasks, which can lead to job displacement for human workers.\n\nIn conclusion, GPT-3 is a powerful AI model that has the potential to revolutionize various industries and applications. However, it also raises concerns about its potential to spread misinformation, bias, and job displacement. As the technology continues to evolve, it is essential to address these concerns and ensure that GPT-3 is developed and used responsibly.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in

and up-to-date responses to user queries [34]\n\n\nInstructGPT\nInstructGPT is a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 trained on a dataset of human-written instructions [37]\n\n\nReception\nGPT-3's builder, OpenAI, was initially founded as a non-profit in 2015 [62] In 2019, OpenAI broke from its usual open-source standards by not publicly releasing GPT-3's predecessor model, citing concerns that the model could facilitate the propagation of fake news OpenAI eventually released a version of GPT-2 that was 8% of the original model's size [63] In the same year, OpenAI restructured to be a for-profit company [64] In 2020, Microsoft announced the company had exclusive licensing of GPT-3 for Microsoft's products and services following a multi-billion dollar investment in OpenAI The agreement permits OpenAI to offer a public-facing API such that users can send text to GPT-3 to receive the model's output, but only Microsoft will have access to GPT-3's source code [5]\n\n\nApplications\nGPT-3's

the series' in July 2019, [58] and said he would be bringing \"a wink and a nod\" to the style of world building and character development from his film franchise John Wick [59] He felt it was interesting to take secondary characters from the films and put them in primary roles for the series, and added that other characters from earlier MCU films are layered into the series and shift the storytelling in new ways [60] Some early elements of the series were decided before Spellman was hired, including roles for the characters Helmut Zemo, Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, and Sharon Carter The latter becomes the Power Broker, which was inspired by a Captain America comic from the 1990s where Carter was exiled from S.H.I.E.L.D and became \"super salty\" [33]\n\n\nInception and tone\nIn

Bucky's been through, and you cannot avoid the fact that Sam is Black.\n\n\nCasting\nWith the official announcement of the series in April 2019 came confirmation that Mackie and Stan would reprise their roles of Wilson and Barnes, respectively, in the series [5] The next month, Daniel Brühl and Emily VanCamp entered negotiations to reprise their respective film roles of Helmut Zemo and Sharon Carter [9] Brühl was confirmed for the series in July 2019, [25] and VanCamp was confirmed a month later when Wyatt Russell was announced as cast in the role of John Walker [13] Russell's past work portraying \"the slacker with long hair and a beard\" did not lend itself to this role, but Marvel liked how his \"unique energy\" differentiated Walker from Wilson and Barnes [6]: 5 \n\n\nDesign\nProduction designer Ray Chan previously served as supervising art director on many MCU films [87] Chan and the producers wanted to give the series a \"global feel\", with a focus on filming on location [88] The general color palette for the series is dark and muted, with some exceptions: the Blip refugee camps are lighter and washed-out, Madripoor has more saturated colors, and Wilson's home in Louisiana has brighter colors and bolder prints [89] Costume designer Michael Crow, who also previously worked on several MCU films, extrapolated from Wilson's streetwear looks in the films but added more color and texture to align with the series' brighter Louisiana scenes For Barnes, Crow was influenced by the classic Americana style and wanted him to have the same \"flavor\" as Steve Rogers, wearing what someone from the 1940s who is trapped in modern times would wear [90]\n\n\nSets and costumes\nProduction designer Ray Chan previously served as supervising art director

\"propaganda plastered across city walls  [with] multiple layers of graffiti and flyers put up, torn down, and defaced\" Perception used movement and lighting to create a \"mysterious ambiance to match the show's atmosphere\", [92] and included various hidden messages and Easter eggs in the sequence, [91] such as references to the Enhanced Humans Act and Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross; the Sokovia Accords; Karli Morgenthau via a wanted poster that mentions various attacks by the Flag Smashers; [93] Madripoor and the Brass Monkey Saloon; [93] [76] past attempts to replicate the Captain America program, including Isaiah Bradley being labeled a \"subject\"; and the Power Broker [93]\n\n\nFilming\nFilming began on October 31, 2019, [94] at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, [95] [96] under the working title Tag Team [97] Mackie and Stan announced the official start of filming on November 4 [98] P.J Dillon was hired as cinematographer at the suggestion of Skogland, who he had worked with on the television series Vikings [99]: 2:36–3:06  Marvel Studios had decided early on in development to shoot The Falcon and the Winter Soldier as if it was a film, with one director and cinematographer filming all of the content at once based on available locations [56] [100] This was in contrast to a more traditional series that would often be broken up into filming blocks by episode and have multiple directors and cinematographers [56] Dillon said emulating a film with the series' budget and schedule was their biggest challenge, but one that he, Skogland, and the rest of the production embraced [101] Mackie compared the production to an MCU film, saying it felt like shooting a six-hour film that would then be cut up into individual episodes rather than filming one episode at a time [102] Feige said the series would have the \"cinematic experience\" of an MCU film across six episodes, [103] while Skogland felt the series was \"relatable\" to the films since it featured \"action, comedy,  [a] high-octane pace, familiar faces, and new characters\" [6]: 1 \n\n\nPost-production\nMarvel Studios hired editors with television experience to help with the fact that the studio had not made a television series before [133] Kelley Dixon edited the first and fourth episodes, Todd Desrosiers edited the second and fifth, and Rosanne Tan edited the third and sixth [100] [125]: 21:05–21:17  Desrosiers previously worked with Skogland on the pilot episode of the television series NOS4A2 and Tan was suggested to Skogland by NOS4A2 showrunner Jami O'Brien [133] Because the series was filmed based on locations rather than episodes, the editors received material out of order and had to work on different episodes at the same time [100] They also continued to treat the series as a long film and sometimes moved scenes between episodes if that worked better for the overall story [125]: 30:30–31:05  The editors were initially working in Atlanta alongside the rest of the crew, but when the production shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic they returned to Los Angeles and began working remotely and coordinating over Zoom [133] Skogland said the crew used their time wisely during the shut down, allowing them to continue with post-production work and make decisions that they usually would not have time to make [64] [126] When production resumed, there was a reduced schedule for completing editing of the series Jeffrey Ford was brought on as a supervising editor to work on all six episodes and help the other editors complete their work in time, having previously edited several MCU films including the Captain America and Avengers films [100] The other editors had already been trying to match Ford's editing style from Captain America: The Winter Soldier Ford became a mentor for them, helping them get used to the workflow of a Marvel Studios production and its visual effects requirements [133] Because of the reduced timeframe to complete the series, the recaps that begin each episode were created by Tan's assistant editor, Caroline Wang [125]: 49:15–49:38 \n\n\nMusic\nHenry Jackman, who scored Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War, began scoring the series by December 2020 [135] Because he was returning to the franchise after several years, Jackman started by creating an \"audio care package\" featuring different themes, orchestrations, and harmonies that he had composed for the Captain America films, to remind himself of that work and organize it before approaching music for the series Jackman explained that the series format allowed him to write a wider range of music than the films since it still required music for big action sequences while having time for more quiet, character-based moments He described the music for the latter sequences as being more patient, with \"lighter and thinner\" instrumentation The many locations visited in the series also allowed Jackman to explore some environment-specific music, such as elements of the Blues genre when exploring Wilson's backstory in Louisiana, or electronic music for Madripoor which Jackman described as \"a grungy rave scenario\" [136]\n\n\nMarketing\nA short teaser for The Falcon and the Winter Soldier was shown at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, featuring Brühl as Zemo The character wears his traditional purple mask from the comics in the teaser [26] Skogland traveled to Budapest, where Brühl was filming The Alienist: Angel of Darkness, to capture the footage [27] Concept art for the series featuring designs for the characters' costumes are included in Expanding the Universe, a Marvel Studios special that debuted on Disney+ on November 12, 2019

final episode's release, Marvel Studios decided to submit The Falcon and the Winter Soldier in the drama series categories for the Primetime Emmy Awards rather than in the limited series categories Moore said this decision was made around the series' premiere, with Marvel Studios feeling that the drama categories were appropriate for the series' more \"dramatic\" content He added that there had not yet been any consideration for if Stan and Mackie would both be submitted for Outstanding Lead Actors or if one would be submitted for Outstanding Supporting Actor; [202] Mackie and Stan were ultimately both submitted for Outstanding Lead Actor [203]\n\n\nDocumentary special\nIn February 2021, the documentary series Marvel Studios: Assembled was announced [204] The special on this series, \"The Making of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\", goes behind the scenes of the series, with Spellman, Skogland, Stan, Mackie, Russell, Kellyman, Cheadle, Brühl, VanCamp, Kasumba, Louis-Dreyfus, and others discussing the importance of racial issues within the narrative, the action scenes, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the production of the series The special was released on Disney+ on April 30, 2021, [171] and was included as part of the series' home media release on April 30, 2024 [175]\n\n\nFuture\nBefore the series premiere, Mackie said there had been no discussions regarding a second season of the series He was also not sure when he would next appear in an MCU film, especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on cinemas [10] Skogland said she was unsure if there would be a second season and felt that she had been able to do everything that she wanted in the first six episodes, but she did say that there were more stories and characters to explore if a second season was made [205] Feige said there were ideas for what \"another one\" could be if a second season was made, but Marvel intended for the series to lead into future MCU films first like they did with WandaVision [64] He added that he did not want to spoil the series by confirming a second season or discussing the plans that Marvel had for the series' characters before the series was fully released [16] In April 2021, Moore said the end of the series would show story elements for a potential second season, adding that the series explored \"evergreen\" topics that lent themselves to further exploration, unlike the contained story of WandaVision [202]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**The Falcon and the Winter

The actors who portrayed the characters in the films were expected to reprise their roles for the limited series. The series were expected to be six to eight episodes each and have a \"hefty budget\" rivaling those of a major studio production. Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige was believed to be taking a \"hands-on role\" in each series' development, focusing on \"continuity of story\" with the films and \"handling\" the actors who would be reprising their roles from the films.\n\n**Production**\n\nBy September 2018, Marvel Studios was developing several limited series for its parent company Disney's streaming service, Disney+, to be centered on supporting characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films who had not starred in their own films.

Kolstad joined the series' in July 2019, and said he would be bringing \"a wink and a nod\" to the style of world building and character development from his film franchise John Wick. He felt it was interesting to take secondary characters from the films and put them in primary roles for the series, and added that other characters from earlier MCU films are layered into the series and shift the storytelling in new ways. Some early elements of the series were decided before Spellman was hired, including roles for the characters Helmut Zemo, Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, and Sharon Carter.

The series also explores themes of trauma, grief, and redemption, as the characters grapple with their own pasts and the consequences of their actions. The world-building in the series is also notable for its attention to detail and its commitment to creating a rich and immersive environment.\n\n**Casting**\n\nThe casting for the series was done with great care, with the actors bringing their characters to life in a way that is both authentic and nuanced. Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan are both standout performances, bringing a depth and complexity to their characters that is rare in television. The supporting cast is also excellent, with standout performances from Indya Bussey, Renes Rivera, and Tyler Dean Flores.\n\n**Design**\n\nThe production design for the series is also noteworthy, with a focus on creating a world that is both realistic and fantastical. The use of practical effects and stunt work adds to the sense of authenticity, and the costumes and production design are carefully tailored to create a sense of time and place.\n\n**Title Sequence**\n\nThe title sequence for the series was created by Perception, who took inspiration from the series' political messages and ideologies.

Because the series was filmed based on locations rather than episodes, the editors received material out of order and had to work on different episodes at the same time. They also continued to treat the series as a long film and sometimes moved scenes between episodes if that worked better for the overall story. Jeffrey Ford was brought on as a supervising editor to work on all six episodes and help the other editors complete their work in time.\n\n**Music**\n\nHenry Jackman, who scored Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War, began scoring the series by December 2020. Because he was returning to the franchise after several years, Jackman started by creating an \"audio care package\" featuring different themes, orchestrations, and harmonies that he had composed for the Captain America films, to remind himself of that work and organize it before approaching music for the series. Jackman explained that the series format allowed him to write a wider range of music than the films since it still required music for big action sequences while having time for more quiet, character-based moments.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nA short teaser for The Falcon and the Winter Soldier was shown at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, featuring Daniel Brühl as Zemo. The character wears his traditional purple mask from the comics in the teaser. Skogland traveled to Budapest, where Brühl was filming The Alienist: Angel of Darkness, to capture the footage. Concept art for the series featuring designs for the characters' costumes are included in Expanding the Universe, a Marvel Studios special that debuted on Disney+ on November 12, 2019.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier debuted on March 19, 2021, on Disney+. Its six episodes were released weekly, concluding on April 23. The series was originally set for release in August 2020, but was pushed back after filming was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. This made it the second series released by Marvel Studios, after WandaVision, despite being developed first. It is part of Phase Four of the MCU.\n\n**Streaming**\n\nThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier debuted on March 19, 2021, on Disney+. Its six episodes were released weekly, concluding on April 23.

This made it the second series released by Marvel Studios, after WandaVision, despite being developed first. It is part of Phase Four of the MCU.\n\n**Home Media**\n\nThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray and Blu-ray by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on April 30, 2024, with SteelBook packaging and concept art cards. Bonus features include the featurette \"Cap's Shield\", deleted scenes, a gag reel, and the Marvel Studios: Assembled documentary special \"The Making of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\".\n\n**Reception**\n\nDisney+ announced that the first episode, \"New World Order\", was the most-watched series premiere ever for the streaming service in its opening weekend (March 19 to 22, 2021), ahead of the premieres of WandaVision and the second season of The Mandalorian. Additionally, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier was the most-watched title overall globally for that time period on Disney+, including in the Disney+ Hotstar markets. Samba TV reported that 1.7 million households watched the episode in its opening weekend. TVision determines viewing impressions by counting its 14,000 viewers on connected televisions who have watched at least two minutes of a title within a session of watching content for at least five minutes, across all major U.S streaming and advertising video on demand services. The company reported that The Falcon and the Winter Soldier was the most-viewed series of April 2021 across measured platforms, being viewed nearly 40 times more than the average series measured by the service.\n\n**Critical Response**\n\nThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier received widespread critical acclaim upon its release, with many praising its engaging storyline, well-developed characters, and timely themes. The series holds a 92% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 242 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nAhead of the final episode's release, Marvel Studios decided to submit The Falcon and the Winter Soldier in the drama series categories for the Primetime Emmy Awards rather than in the limited series categories. This decision was made around the series' premiere, with Marvel Studios feeling that the drama categories were appropriate for the series' more \"dramatic\" content. There had not yet been any consideration for if Stan and Mackie would both be submitted for Outstanding Lead Actors or if one would be submitted for Outstanding Supporting Actor.\n\n**Documentary Special**\n\nIn February 2021, the documentary series Marvel Studios: Assembled was announced. The special on this series, \"The Making of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\", goes behind the scenes of the series, with Spellman, Skogland, Stan, Mackie, Russell, Kellyman, Cheadle, Brühl, VanCamp, Kasumba, Louis-Dreyfus, and others discussing the importance of racial issues within the narrative, the action scenes, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the production of the series. The special was released on Disney+ on April 30, 2021, and was included as part of the series' home media release on April 30, 2024.\n\n**Future**\n\nBefore the series premiere, Mackie said there had been no discussions regarding a second season of the series. He was also not sure when he would next appear in an MCU film, especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on cinemas. Skogland said she was unsure if there would be a second season and felt that she had been able to do everything that she wanted in the first six episodes, but she did say that there were more stories and characters to explore if a second season was made. Feige said there were ideas for what \"another one\" could be if a second season was made, but Marvel intended for the series to lead into future MCU films first like they did with WandaVision. He added that he did not want to spoil the series by confirming a second season or discussing the plans that Marvel had for the series' characters before the series was fully released. In April 2021, Moore said the end of the series would show story elements for a potential second season, adding that the series explored \"evergreen\" topics that lent themselves to further exploration, unlike the contained story of WandaVision.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Falcon_and_the_Winter_Soldier\" following this

he would be bringing \"a wink and a nod\" to the style of world building and character development from his film franchise John Wick [59] He felt it was interesting to take secondary characters from the films and put them in primary roles for the series, and added that other characters from earlier MCU films are layered into the series and shift the storytelling in new ways [60] Some early elements of the series were decided before Spellman was hired, including roles for the characters Helmut Zemo, Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, and Sharon Carter The latter becomes the Power Broker,

avoid the fact that Sam is Black.\n\n\nCasting\nWith the official announcement of the series in April 2019 came confirmation that Mackie and Stan would reprise their roles of Wilson and Barnes, respectively, in the series [5] The next month, Daniel Brühl and Emily VanCamp entered negotiations to reprise their respective film roles of Helmut Zemo and Sharon Carter [9] Brühl was confirmed for the series in July 2019, [25] and VanCamp was confirmed a month later when Wyatt Russell was announced as cast in the role of John Walker [13] Russell's past work portraying \"the slacker with long hair and a beard\" did not lend itself to this role, but Marvel liked how his \"unique energy\" differentiated Walker from Wilson and Barnes [6]: 5 \n\n\nDesign\nProduction designer Ray Chan previously served as supervising art director on many MCU films [87] Chan and the producers wanted to give the series a \"global feel\", with a focus on filming on location [88] The general color palette for the series is dark and muted, with some exceptions: the Blip refugee camps are lighter and washed-out, Madripoor has more saturated colors, and Wilson's home in Louisiana has brighter colors and bolder prints [89] Costume designer Michael Crow, who also previously worked on several MCU films, extrapolated from Wilson's streetwear looks in the films but added more color and texture to align with the series' brighter Louisiana scenes For Barnes, Crow was influenced by the classic Americana style and wanted him to have the same \"flavor\" as Steve Rogers, wearing what someone from the 1940s who is trapped in modern times would wear [90]\n\n\nSets and costumes\nProduction designer Ray Chan previously served as supervising art director on many MCU films [87] Chan and the

multiple layers of graffiti and flyers put up, torn down, and defaced\" Perception used movement and lighting to create a \"mysterious ambiance to match the show's atmosphere\", [92] and included various hidden messages and Easter eggs in the sequence, [91] such as references to the Enhanced Humans Act and Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross; the Sokovia Accords; Karli Morgenthau via a wanted poster that mentions various attacks by the Flag Smashers; [93] Madripoor and the Brass Monkey Saloon; [93] [76] past attempts to replicate the Captain America program, including Isaiah Bradley being labeled

Mackie and Stan announced the official start of filming on November 4 [98] P.J Dillon was hired as cinematographer at the suggestion of Skogland, who he had worked with on the television series Vikings [99]: 2:36–3:06  Marvel Studios had decided early on in development to shoot The Falcon and the Winter Soldier as if it was a film, with one director and cinematographer filming all of the content at once based on available locations [56] [100] This was in contrast to a more traditional series that would often be broken up into filming blocks by episode and have multiple directors and cinematographers [56] Dillon said emulating a film with the series' budget and schedule was their biggest challenge, but one that he, Skogland, and the rest of the production embraced [101] Mackie compared the production to an MCU film, saying it felt like shooting a six-hour film that would then be cut up into individual episodes rather than filming one episode at a time [102] Feige said the series would have the \"cinematic experience\" of an MCU film across six episodes, [103] while Skogland felt the series was \"relatable\" to the films since it featured \"action, comedy,  [a] high-octane pace, familiar faces, and new characters\" [6]: 1 \n\n\nPost-production\nMarvel Studios hired editors with television experience to help with the fact that the studio had not made a

production shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic they returned to Los Angeles and began working remotely and coordinating over Zoom [133] Skogland said the crew used their time wisely during the shut down, allowing them to continue with post-production work and make decisions that they usually would not have time to make [64] [126] When production resumed, there was a reduced schedule for completing editing of the series Jeffrey Ford was brought on as a supervising editor to work on all six episodes and help the other editors complete their work in time, having previously edited several MCU films including the Captain America and Avengers films [100] The other editors had already been trying to match Ford's editing style from Captain America: The Winter Soldier Ford became a mentor for them, helping them get used to the workflow of a Marvel Studios production and its visual effects requirements [133] Because of the reduced timeframe to complete the series, the recaps that begin each episode were created by Tan's assistant editor, Caroline Wang [125]: 49:15–49:38 \n\n\nMusic\nHenry Jackman, who scored Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War,

series format allowed him to write a wider range of music than the films since it still required music for big action sequences while having time for more quiet, character-based moments He described the music for the latter sequences as being more patient, with \"lighter and thinner\" instrumentation The many locations visited in the series also allowed Jackman to explore some environment-specific music, such as elements of the Blues genre when exploring Wilson's backstory in Louisiana, or electronic music for Madripoor which Jackman described as \"a grungy rave scenario\"

{"title": "Malaysia", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe name Malaysia is a combination of the word Malays and the Latin-Greek suffix -ia/-ία [18] which can be translated as 'land of the Malays' [19] Similar-sounding variants have also appeared in accounts older than the 11th century, as toponyms for areas in Sumatra or referring to a larger region around the Strait of Malacca [20] The Sanskrit text Vayu Purana, thought to have been in existence since the first millennium CE, mentioned a land named 'Malayadvipa' which was identified by certain scholars as the modern Malay Peninsula [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] Other notable accounts are by the 2nd-century Ptolemy's Geographia that used the name Malayu Kulon for the west coast of Golden Chersonese, and the 7th-century Yijing's account of Malayu [20]\n\n\nHistory\nEvidence of modern human habitation in Malaysia dates back 40,000 years [42] In the Malay Peninsula, the first inhabitants are thought to be Negritos [43] [44] Areas of Malaysia participated in the Maritime Jade Road between 2000 BC to 1000 AD [45] [46] [47] [48] Traders and settlers from India and China arrived as early as the first century AD, establishing trading ports and coastal towns in the second and third centuries Their presence resulted in strong Indian and Chinese influences on the local cultures, and the people of the Malay Peninsula adopted the religions of Hinduism and Buddhism Sanskrit inscriptions appear as early as the fourth or fifth century [49] The Kingdom of Langkasuka arose around the second century in the northern area of the Malay Peninsula, lasting until about the 15th century [37] Between the 7th and 13th centuries, much of the southern Malay Peninsula was part of the maritime Srivijayan empire By the 13th and the 14th century, the Majapahit empire had successfully wrested control over most of the peninsula and the Malay Archipelago from Srivijaya [50] In the early 15th century, Parameswara, a runaway king of the former Kingdom of Singapura linked to the old Srivijayan court, founded the Malacca Sultanate [51] The spread of Islam increased following Parameswara's conversion to that religion Malacca was an important commercial centre during this time, attracting trade from around the region [52]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nMalaysia is a federal constitutional elective monarchy; the only federal country in Southeast Asia [75] The system of government is closely modelled on the Westminster parliamentary system, a legacy of British rule [76] The head of state is the King, whose official title is the Yang di-Pertuan Agong The King is elected to a five-year term by and from among the nine hereditary rulers of the Malay states The other four states, which have titular Governors, do not participate in the selection By informal agreement the position is rotated among the nine, [76] and has been held by Ibrahim Iskandar of Johor since 31 January 2024 The King's role has been largely ceremonial since changes to the constitution in 1994, picking ministers and members of the upper house [77]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nMalaysia is a federation of 13 states and three federal territories [100] These are divided between two regions, with 11 states and two federal territories on Peninsular Malaysia and the other two states and one federal territory in East Malaysia Each state is divided into districts, which are then divided into mukim In Sabah and Sarawak districts are grouped into divisions [101]\n\n\nForeign relations and military\nA founding member of ASEAN [115] and OIC, [116] the country participates in many international organisations such as the United Nations (U.N.), [117] APEC, [118] the D-8 Organization for Economic Cooperation, [119] and NAM [120] It has chaired ASEAN, OIC, and NAM in the past [52] A former British colony, it is also a member of the Commonwealth [121] Kuala Lumpur was the site of the first EAS in 2005 [122]\n\n\nHuman rights\nHomosexuality is illegal in Malaysia, [147] [148] and authorities have imposed punishments such as caning and imprisonment [149] [150] Human trafficking and sex trafficking in Malaysia are significant problems [151] [152] There have also been cases of vigilante executions and beatings against LGBT individuals in Malaysia [153] [154] The illegality of homosexuality in Malaysia has also been the forefront of Anwar Ibrahim's sodomy trials, which Anwar has called politically motivated, a characterization supported by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, along with Amnesty International and the Human Rights Watch [155] [156] [157]\n\n\nGeography\nMalaysia is the 66th largest country by total land area, with a total area of 330,803 km2 (127,724 sq mi) [9] It has land borders with Thailand in West Malaysia, and Indonesia and Brunei in East Malaysia [19] It is linked to Singapore by a narrow causeway and a bridge The country also has maritime boundaries with Vietnam [162] and the Philippines [163] The land borders are defined in large part by geological features such as the Perlis River, the Golok River and the Pagalayan Canal, whilst some of the maritime boundaries are the subject of ongoing contention [19] Brunei forms what is almost an enclave in Malaysia, [164] with the state of Sarawak dividing it into two parts Malaysia is the only country with territory on both the Asian mainland and the Malay archipelago [165] The Strait of Malacca, lying between Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia, is one of the most important thoroughfares in global commerce, carrying 40 per cent of the world's trade [166]\n\n\nBiodiversity and conservation\nMalaysia signed the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 12 June 1993, and became a party to the convention on 24 June 1994 [175] It has subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, which was received by the convention on 16 April 1998 [176] The country is megadiverse with a high number of species and high levels of endemism [177] It is estimated to contain 20 per cent of the world's animal species [178] High levels of endemism are found on the diverse forests of Borneo's mountains, as species are isolated from each other by lowland forest [165]\n\n\nEconomy\nMalaysia is a relatively open state-oriented and newly industrialised market economy [194] It has the world's 36th-largest economy by nominal GDP and the 31st-largest by PPP In 2017, the large service sector contributed to 53.6% of total GDP, the industrial sector 37.6%, and the small agricultural sector roughly 8.8% [195] Malaysia has a low official unemployment rate of 3.9% [196] Its foreign exchange reserves are the world's 24th-largest [197] It has a labour force of about 15 million, which is the world's 34th-largest [198] Malaysia's large automotive industry ranks as the world's 22nd-largest by production [199]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nRailway transport in Malaysia is state-run, and spans some 2,783 kilometres (1,729 mi) [219] As of 2016 [update], Malaysia has the world's 26th-largest road network, with some 238,823 kilometres (148,398 mi) of roads Malaysia's inland waterways are the world's 22nd-longest, and total 7,200 km (4,474 mi) [220] Among Malaysia's 114 airports, [221] among which the busiest is Kuala Lumpur International Airport located south of Kuala Lumpur in Sepang District, which is also the twelfth-busiest airport in Asia Among the 7 federal ports, the major one is Port Klang, [222] which is the thirteenth-busiest container port [223] Malaysia's flag carrier is Malaysia Airlines, providing international and domestic air services [224]\n\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the Malaysian Department of Statistics, the country's population was 32,447,385 in 2020, [235] making it the 42nd most populated country According to a 2012 estimate, the population is increasing by 1.54 per cent per year Malaysia has an average population density of 96 people per km2, ranking it 116th in the world for population density People within the 15–64 age group constitute 69.5 per cent of the total population; the 0–14 age group corresponds to 24.5 per cent; while senior citizens aged 65 years or older make up 6.0 per cent In 1960, when the first official census was recorded in Malaysia, the population was 8.11 million 91.8 per cent of the population are Malaysian citizens [236]\n\n\nReligion\nThe constitution grants freedom of religion, while establishing Islam as the \"religion of the Federation\" [253] [254] According to the Population and Housing Census 2020 figures, ethnicity and religious beliefs correlate highly Approximately 63.5% of the population practise Islam, 18.7% practise Buddhism, 9.1% Christianity, 6.1% Hinduism and 1.3% practise Confucianism, Taoism and other traditional Chinese religions 2.7% declared no religion or practised other religions or did not provide any information [235] The states of Sarawak, Penang and the federal territory of Kuala Lumpur have non-Muslim majorities [255] [256]\n\n\nLanguages\nThe official and national language of Malaysia is Malaysian Malay, [19] a standardised form of the Malay language [261] The previous official terminology was Bahasa Malaysia (lit. 'Malaysian language') [262] [263] [264] but now government policy uses \"Bahasa Melayu\" (Malay language) to refer to the official language [265] and both terms remain in use [266] [267] The National Language Act 1967 specifies the Latin (Rumi) script as the official script of the national language, but does not prohibit the use of the traditional Jawi script [268]\n\n\nHealth\nMalaysia operates an efficient and widespread two-tier healthcare system, consisting of a universal healthcare system and a co-existing private healthcare system; provided by highly subsidized healthcare through its extensive network of public hospitals and clinics [282] The Ministry of Health is the main provider of healthcare services to the country's population [283] Malaysia's healthcare system is considered to be among the most developed in Asia, which contributes to its thriving medical tourism industry [284]\n\n\nEducation\nThe education system of Malaysia features a non-compulsory kindergarten education followed by six years of compulsory primary education, and five years of optional secondary education [294] Schools in the primary education system are divided into two categories: national primary schools, which teach in Malay, and vernacular schools, which teach in Chinese or Tamil [295] Secondary education is conducted for five years In the final year of secondary education, students sit for the Malaysian Certificate of Education examination [296] Since the introduction of the matriculation programme in 1999, students who completed the 12-month programme in matriculation colleges can enroll in local universities However, in the matriculation system, only 10 per cent of places are open to non-bumiputera [jargon] students [297]\n\n\nCulture\nMalaysia has a multi-ethnic, multicultural, and multilingual society Substantial influence exists from Chinese and Indian culture, dating back to when foreign trade began Other cultural influences include the Persian, Arabic, and British cultures Due to the structure of the government, coupled with the social contract theory, there has been minimal cultural assimilation of ethnic minorities [298] Some cultural disputes exist between Malaysia and neighbouring countries, notably Indonesia [299]\n\n\nFine arts\nTraditional Malaysian art was mainly centred on the areas of carving, weaving, and silversmithing [302] Traditional art ranges from handwoven baskets from rural areas to the silverwork of the Malay courts Common artworks included ornamental kris, beetle nut sets, and woven batik and songket fabrics Indigenous East Malaysians are known for their wooden masks [165] Each ethnic group have distinct performing arts, with little overlap between them However, Malay art does show some North Indian influence due to the historical influence of India [303]\n\n\nCuisine\nMalaysia's cuisine reflects the multi-ethnic makeup of its population [309] Many cultures from within the country and from surrounding regions have greatly influenced the cuisine Much of the influence comes from the Malay, Chinese, Indian, Thai, Javanese, and Sumatran cultures, [165] largely due to the country being part of the ancient spice route [310] The cuisine is very similar to that of Singapore and Brunei, [188] and also bears resemblance to Filipino cuisine [165] The different states have varied dishes, [188] and often the food in Malaysia is different from the original dishes [244]\n\n\nMedia\nMalaysia's main newspapers are owned by the government and political parties in the ruling coalition, [314] [315] although some major opposition parties also have their own, which are openly sold alongside regular newspapers A divide exists between the media in the two halves of the country Peninsular-based media gives low priority to news from the East, and often treats the eastern states as colonies of the peninsula [316] As a result of this, East Malaysia region of Sarawak launched TV Sarawak as internet streaming beginning in 2014, and as TV station on 10 October 2020 [317] to overcome the low priority and coverage of Peninsular-based media and to solidify the representation of East Malaysia [318] The media have been blamed for increasing tension between Indonesia and Malaysia, and giving Malaysians a bad image of Indonesians [319] The country has Malay, English, Chinese, and Tamil dailies [316] Kadazandusun and Bajau news are only available via TV broadcast Berita RTM [320] Written Kadazan news was once included in publications such as The Borneo Post, the Borneo Mail, the Daily Express, and the New Sabah Times, but publication has ceased with the newspaper or as a section [321] [322]\n\n\nHolidays and festivals\nMalaysians observe a number of holidays and festivities throughout the year Some are federally gazetted public holidays and some are observed by individual states Other festivals are observed by particular ethnic or religion groups, and the main holiday of each major group has been declared a public holiday The most observed national holiday is Hari Merdeka (Independence Day) on 31 August, commemorating the independence of the Federation of Malaya in 1957 [165] Malaysia Day on 16 September commemorates federation in 1963 [327] Other notable national holidays are Labour Day (1 May) and the King's birthday (first week of June) [165]\n\n\nSports\nPopular sports in Malaysia include association football, badminton, field hockey, bowls, tennis, squash, martial arts, horse riding, sailing, and skate boarding [227] Football is the most popular sport in Malaysia [332] Badminton matches also attract thousands of spectators, and since 1948 Malaysia has been one of four countries to hold the Thomas Cup, the world team championship trophy of men's badminton [333] The Malaysian Lawn Bowls Federation was registered in 1997 [334] Squash was brought to the country by members of the British army, with the first competition being held in 1939 [335] The Squash Racquets Association of Malaysia was created on 25 June 1972 [336] The men's national field hockey team ranked 10th in the world as of June 2022 [update] [337] The 3rd Hockey World Cup was hosted at Merdeka Stadium in Kuala Lumpur, as well as the 10th cup [338] The country also has its own Formula One track – the Sepang International Circuit, with the first Malaysian Grand Prix held in 1999 [339] Traditional sports include Silat Melayu, the most common style of martial arts practised by ethnic Malays [340]\n\n\nSee also\n2°N 112°E﻿ / ﻿2°N 112°E﻿ / 2; 112\n\n\nNotes\n2°N 112°E﻿ / ﻿2°N 112°E﻿ / 2; 112\n\n\nReferences\n2°N 112°E﻿ / ﻿2°N

Malaysia's inland waterways are the world's 22nd-longest, and total 7,200 km (4,474 mi). Among Malaysia's 114 airports, among which the busiest is Kuala Lumpur International Airport located south of Kuala Lumpur in Sepang District, which is also the twelfth-busiest airport in Asia. Among the 7 federal ports, the major one is Port Klang, which is the thirteenth-busiest container port. Malaysia's flag carrier is Malaysia Airlines, providing international and domestic air services.\n\nDemographics\n------------\n\nAccording to the Malaysian Department of Statistics, the country's population was 32,447,385 in 2020, making it the 42nd most populated country. According to a 2012 estimate, the population is increasing by 1.54 per cent per year. Malaysia has an average population density of 96 people per km2, ranking it 116th in the world for population density. People within the 15-64 age group constitute 69.5 per cent of the total population; the 0-14 age group corresponds to 24.5 per cent; while senior citizens aged 65 years or older make up 6.0 per cent. In 1960, when the first official census was recorded in Malaysia, the population was 8.11 million. 91.8 per cent of the population are Malaysian citizens.\n\nReligion\n---------\n\nThe constitution grants freedom of religion, while establishing Islam as the \"religion of the Federation\". According to the Population and Housing Census 2020 figures, ethnicity and religious beliefs correlate highly. Approximately 63.5 per cent of the population practise Islam, 18.7 per cent practise Buddhism, 9.1 per cent Christianity, 6.1 per cent Hinduism, and 1.3 per cent practise Confucianism, Taoism, and other traditional Chinese religions. 2.7 per cent declared no religion or practised other religions or did not provide any information. The states of Sarawak, Penang, and the federal territory of Kuala Lumpur have non-Muslim majorities.\n\nLanguages\n----------\n\nThe official and national language of Malaysia is Malaysian Malay, a standardised form of the Malay language. The previous official terminology was Bahasa Malaysia (lit. \"Malaysian language\"). But now government policy uses \"Bahasa Melayu\" (Malay language) to refer to the official language, and both terms remain in use. The National Language Act 1967 specifies the Latin (Rumi) script as the official script of the national language, but does not prohibit the use of the traditional Jawi script.\n\nHealth\n--------\n\nMalaysia operates an efficient and widespread two-tier healthcare system, consisting of a universal healthcare system and a co-existing private healthcare system; provided by highly subsidised healthcare through its extensive network of public hospitals and clinics. The Ministry of Health is the main provider of healthcare services to the country's population. Malaysia's healthcare system is considered to be among the most developed in Asia, which contributes to its thriving medical tourism industry.\n\nEducation\n----------\n\nThe education system of Malaysia features a non-compulsory kindergarten education followed by six years of compulsory primary education, and five years of optional secondary education. Schools in the primary education system are divided into two categories: national primary schools, which teach in Malay, and vernacular schools, which teach in Chinese or Tamil. Secondary education is conducted for five years. In the final year of secondary education, students sit for the Malaysian Certificate of Education examination. Since the introduction of the matriculation programme in 1999, students who completed the 12-month programme in matriculation colleges can enroll in local universities. However, in the matriculation system, only 10 per cent of places are open to non-bumiputera students.\n\nCulture\n--------\n\nMalaysia has a multi-ethnic, multicultural, and multilingual society. Substantial influence exists from Chinese and Indian culture, dating back to when foreign trade began. Other cultural influences include the Persian, Arabic, and British cultures. Due to the structure of the government, coupled with the social contract theory, there has been minimal cultural assimilation of ethnic minorities. Some cultural disputes exist between Malaysia and neighbouring countries, notably Indonesia.\n\nFine Arts\n---------\n\nTraditional Malaysian art was mainly centred on the areas of carving, weaving, and silversmithing. Traditional art ranges from handwoven baskets from rural areas to the silverwork of the Malay courts. Common artworks included ornamental kris, beetle nut sets, and woven batik and songket fabrics. Indigenous East Malaysians are known for their wooden masks. Each ethnic group has distinct performing arts, with little overlap between them. However, Malay art does show some North Indian influence due to the historical influence of India.\n\nCuisine\n--------\n\nMalaysia's cuisine reflects the multi-ethnic makeup of its population. Many cultures from within the country and from surrounding regions have greatly influenced the cuisine. Much of the influence comes from the Malay, Chinese, Indian, Thai, Javanese, and Sumatran cultures, largely due to the country being part of the ancient spice route. The cuisine is very similar to that of Singapore and Brunei, and also bears resemblance to Filipino cuisine. The different states have varied dishes, and often the food in Malaysia is different from the original dishes.\n\nMedia\n--------\n\nMalaysia's main newspapers are owned by the government and political parties in the ruling coalition, although some major opposition parties also have their own, which are openly sold alongside regular newspapers. A divide exists between the media in the two halves of the country. Peninsular-based media gives low priority to news from the East, and often treats the eastern states as colonies of the peninsula. As a result of this, East Malaysia region of Sarawak launched TV Sarawak as internet streaming beginning in 2014, and as TV station on 10 October 2020 to overcome the low priority and coverage of Peninsular-based media and to solidify the representation of East Malaysia. The media have been blamed for increasing tension between Indonesia and Malaysia, and giving Malaysians a bad image of Indonesians. The country has Malay, English, Chinese, and Tamil dailies. Kadazandusun and Bajau news are only available via TV broadcast Berita RTM. Written Kadazan news was once included in publications such as The Borneo Post, the Borneo Mail, the Daily Express, and the New Sabah Times, but publication has ceased with the newspaper or as a section.\n\nHolidays and Festivals\n-----------------------\n\nMalayians observe a number of holidays and festivities throughout the year. Some are federally gazetted public holidays, and some are observed by individual states. Other festivals are observed by particular ethnic or religion groups, and the main holiday of each major group has been declared a public holiday. The most observed national holiday is Hari Merdeka (Independence Day) on 31 August, commemorating the independence of the Federation of Malaya in 1957. Malaysia Day on 16 September commemorates federation in 1963. Other notable national holidays are Labour Day (1 May) and the King's birthday (first week of June).\n\nSports\n--------\n\nPopular sports in Malaysia include association football, badminton, field hockey, bowls, tennis, squash, martial arts, horse riding, sailing, and skate boarding. Football is the most popular sport in Malaysia. Badminton matches also attract thousands of spectators, and since 1948 Malaysia has been one of four countries to hold the Thomas Cup, the world team championship trophy of men's badminton. The Malaysian Lawn Bowls Federation was registered in 1997. Squash was brought to the country by members of the British army, with the first competition being held in 1939. The Squash Racquets Association of Malaysia was created on 25 June 1972. The men's national field hockey team ranked 10th in the world as of June 2022. The 3rd Hockey World Cup was hosted at Merdeka Stadium in Kuala Lumpur, as well as the 10th cup. The country also has its own Formula One track – the Sepang International Circuit, with the first Malaysian Grand Prix held in 1999. Traditional sports include Silat Melayu, the most common style of martial arts practised by ethnic Malays.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Malaysia\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe name Malaysia is a combination of the word Malays and the Latin-Greek suffix -ia/-ία [18] which can be translated as 'land of the Malays' [19] Similar-sounding variants have also appeared in accounts older than the 11th century, as toponyms for areas in Sumatra or referring to a larger region around the Strait of Malacca [20] The Sanskrit text Vayu Purana, thought to have been in existence since the first millennium CE, mentioned a land named 'Malayadvipa' which was identified by certain scholars as the modern Malay Peninsula [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] Other notable accounts are by the 2nd-century Ptolemy's Geographia that used the name Malayu Kulon for the west coast of Golden Chersonese, and the 7th-century Yijing's account of Malayu [20]\n\n\nHistory\nEvidence of modern human habitation in Malaysia dates back 40,000 years [42] In the Malay Peninsula, the first inhabitants are thought to be Negritos [43] [44] Areas of Malaysia participated in the Maritime Jade Road between 2000 BC to 1000 AD [45] [46] [47] [48] Traders and settlers from India and China arrived as early as the first century AD, establishing trading ports and coastal towns in the second and third centuries Their presence resulted in strong Indian and Chinese influences on the local cultures, and the people of the Malay Peninsula adopted the religions of Hinduism and Buddhism Sanskrit inscriptions appear as early as the fourth or fifth century [49] The Kingdom of Langkasuka arose around the second century in the northern area of the Malay Peninsula, lasting until about the 15th century [37] Between the 7th and 13th centuries, much of the southern Malay Peninsula was part of the maritime Srivijayan empire By the 13th and the 14th century, the Majapahit empire had successfully wrested control over most of the peninsula and the Malay Archipelago from Srivijaya [50] In the early 15th century, Parameswara, a runaway king of the former Kingdom of Singapura linked to the old Srivijayan court, founded the Malacca Sultanate [51] The spread of Islam increased following Parameswara's conversion to that religion Malacca was an important commercial centre during this time, attracting trade from around the region [52]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nMalaysia is a federal constitutional elective monarchy; the only federal country in Southeast Asia [75] The system of government is closely modelled on the Westminster parliamentary system, a legacy of British rule [76] The head of state is the King, whose official title is the Yang di-Pertuan Agong The King is elected to a five-year term by and from among the nine hereditary rulers of the Malay states The other four states, which have titular Governors, do not participate in the selection By informal agreement the position is rotated among the nine, [76] and has been held by Ibrahim Iskandar of Johor since 31 January 2024 The King's role has been largely ceremonial since changes to the constitution in 1994, picking ministers and members of the upper house [77]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nMalaysia is a federation of 13 states and three federal territories [100] These are divided between two regions, with 11 states and two federal territories on Peninsular Malaysia and the other two states and one federal territory in East Malaysia Each state is divided into districts, which are then divided into mukim In Sabah and Sarawak districts are grouped into divisions [101]\n\n\nForeign relations and military\nA founding member of ASEAN [115] and OIC, [116] the country participates in many international organisations such as the United Nations (U.N.), [117] APEC, [118] the D-8 Organization for Economic Cooperation, [119] and NAM [120] It has chaired ASEAN, OIC, and NAM in the past [52] A former British colony, it is also a member of the Commonwealth [121] Kuala Lumpur was the site of the first EAS in 2005 [122]\n\n\nHuman rights\nHomosexuality is illegal in Malaysia, [147] [148] and authorities have imposed punishments such as caning and imprisonment [149] [150] Human trafficking and sex trafficking in Malaysia are significant problems [151] [152] There have also been cases of vigilante executions and beatings against LGBT individuals in Malaysia [153] [154] The illegality of homosexuality in Malaysia has also been the forefront of Anwar Ibrahim's sodomy trials, which Anwar has called politically motivated, a characterization supported by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, along with Amnesty International and the Human Rights Watch [155] [156] [157]\n\n\nGeography\nMalaysia is the 66th largest country by total land area, with a total area of 330,803 km2 (127,724 sq mi) [9] It has land borders with Thailand in West Malaysia, and Indonesia and Brunei in East Malaysia [19] It is linked to Singapore by a narrow causeway and a bridge The country also has maritime boundaries with Vietnam [162] and the Philippines [163] The land borders are defined in large part by geological features such as the Perlis River, the Golok River and the Pagalayan Canal, whilst some of the maritime boundaries are the subject of ongoing contention [19] Brunei forms what is almost an enclave in Malaysia, [164] with the state of Sarawak dividing it into two parts Malaysia is the only country with territory on both the Asian mainland and the Malay archipelago [165] The Strait of Malacca, lying between Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia, is one of the most important thoroughfares in global commerce, carrying 40 per cent of the world's trade [166]\n\n\nBiodiversity and conservation\nMalaysia signed the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 12 June 1993, and became a party to the convention on 24 June 1994 [175] It has subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, which was received by the convention on 16 April 1998 [176] The country is megadiverse with a high number of species and high levels of endemism [177] It is estimated to contain 20 per cent of the world's animal species [178] High levels of endemism are found on the diverse forests of Borneo's mountains, as species are isolated from each other by lowland forest [165]\n\n\nEconomy\nMalaysia is a relatively open state-oriented and newly industrialised market economy [194] It has the world's 36th-largest economy by nominal GDP and the 31st-largest by PPP In 2017, the large service sector contributed to 53.6% of total GDP, the industrial sector 37.6%, and the small agricultural sector roughly 8.8% [195] Malaysia has a low official unemployment rate of 3.9% [196] Its foreign exchange reserves are the world's 24th-largest [197] It has a labour force of about 15 million, which is the world's 34th-largest [198]
