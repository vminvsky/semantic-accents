{"title": "Alexander_Cameron_(priest)", "content": "\nEarly life\nAs soon as he was weaned, Cameron was given by his parents in fosterage, as was traditional practice among Irish and Scottish clans, to be raised by relatives within Clan Cameron During the 1754 trial of Alexander Cameron's brother, John Cameron of Fassiefern, the testimony of Donald Cameron of Clunes identified the future priest's foster-father as John MacIngveg (Scottish Gaelic: Iain mac Aonghas Bheag), wadsetter of Glendessary House Clunes further testified, \"According to the customs of the country, Glendessarie (sic) set apart thirty cows, and Lochiel, the father, the like number, and they were all kept at Glendessarie, and the produce of these cows is intended to be for Stock to the infant.. and that when he went abroad, that stock was disposed of, and the price given to Alexander, and that it amounted to £150 Sterling and upwards.\" [31]\n\n\nFamily background\nAlexander Cameron was born on 17 September 1701 [1] at Achnacarry Castle [2] He was son of John Cameron, tanist of Lochiel Alexander Cameron's mother, Lady Isobel Campbell of Lochnell, came from a cadet branch of Clan Campbell and was, through maternal descent, the granddaughter of the 7th chief of Clan Stewart of Appin She was also the younger sister of Sir Donald Campbell, 7th of Lochnell, who commanded one of the Independent Highland Companies in the service of the House of Hanover in the 1745 rising and became important to Scottish Gaelic literature after it ended Sir Donald was named in Jacobite poet Alasdair Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair's 1751 anti-Whig and anti-Campbell satirical Aisling poem An Airc (\"The Ark\") as one of a long list of those whom the Bard viewed as honourable Campbells who, during the second Great Flood prophesied to imminently strike all upon Clan Campbell's lands, were to be welcomed aboard the new Ark [26] [27] Two of Alexander Cameron's other maternal uncles converted to Catholicism One of them was Fr Colin Campbell, who became an admired leader among his fellow outlawed Roman Catholic priests of the Highland District, [3] but whose private crusade against Jansenism, or Crypto-Calvinism, among the priests of that same District has since been characterized, by at least one recent historian, as a witch hunt [28]\n\n\nEarly life\nAs soon as he was weaned, Cameron was given by his parents in fosterage, as was traditional practice among Irish and Scottish clans, to be raised by relatives within Clan Cameron During the 1754 trial of Alexander Cameron's brother, John Cameron of Fassiefern, the testimony of Donald Cameron of Clunes identified the future priest's foster-father as John MacIngveg (Scottish Gaelic: Iain mac Aonghas Bheag), wadsetter of Glendessary House Clunes further testified, \"According to the customs of the country, Glendessarie (sic) set apart thirty cows, and Lochiel, the father, the like number, and they were all kept at Glendessarie, and the produce of these cows is intended to be for Stock to the infant.. and that when he went abroad, that stock was disposed of, and the price given to Alexander, and that it amounted to £150 Sterling and upwards.\" [31]\n\n\nConversion to Catholicism\nAfter this, Alexander Cameron travelled on a Grand Tour throughout Europe After arriving in the Papal States, Alexander Cameron stayed at the Palazzo Muti in Rome, the home and the government in exile of Prince James Francis Edward Stuart, who was known to Whigs as \"The Old Pretender\" and to Jacobites as, \"The King over the Water.\" Through the influence of his uncle, Alan Cameron, Alexander Cameron was granted a position as an honorary gentleman of the bedchamber to the Prince He would have joined both his Royal master and Maria Clementina Sobieska, the Queen in exile, at formal Roman Feasts, which would also have involved attending the Tridentine Mass when it was accompanied by the liturgical polyphony of Palestrina, Tomas Luis de Vittoria, and many other great composers like them These experiences are believed to have had an enormous influence upon his future spiritual development [3] [42]\n\n\nSeminary studies\nAlexander Cameron travelled to Douai in 1730 In a 1731 Italian language petition to Franz Retz, the Superior General of the Society of Jesus, and which still survives, Cameron explained that he had applied to the Scots College in Douai to be allowed to enter the novitiate in Tournai, but had been told that there was difficulty in admitting him There was already another Scottish novice studying in Tournai and the Scots College could not afford to pay 300 florins a year for another Reminding the Superior General that he had recently done so for an Irish novice, Cameron asked that the local Jesuit Provincial be ordered to admit him gratis Cameron also requested, as he was already somewhat older than the usual Jesuit postulant, that he be exempted from teaching after completing his theology studies, as he was also anxious to instead be sent to serve in the missions [54]\n\n\nThe cave in Glen Cannich\nCameron lived with and shared his priestly ministry in Strathglass with two fellow Jesuits whom he had first met as fellow seminarians in Douai [60] John Farquharson (Scottish Gaelic: Maighstir Iain, an-tAthair Iain Mac Fhearchair) was a veteran \"heather priest\" and early collector of local Scottish Gaelic literature He often travelled disguised in a kilt and tartan hose to evade capture by the priest hunters [61] [62] They were also joined by Charles Farquharson (Scottish Gaelic: Maighstir Teàrlach, an t-Athair Teàrlach Mac Fhearchair), Maighstir Iain's brother \n\n\nThe Rising\nAccording to a later report by Bishop John Geddes, as outlawed clergymen of an illegal and underground church denomination, it is understandable why both Bishop Hugh MacDonald and Alexander Cameron would have felt very hopeful about Jacobitism, due the House of Stuart's promises of Catholic Emancipation, freedom of religion, and civil rights to everyone outside the Established Churches of the realm It is equally understandable why the Scottish Catholic laity, who, \"were discouraged and much exposed to oppression\", would similarly, \"wish for an event that was likely to release them, and put them again into the possession of the privileges of free-born citizens.\" [86]\n\n\nThe Year of the Pillaging\nAccording to Bishop John Geddes, \"Immediately after the Battle of Culloden, orders were issued for the demolishing all the Catholic chapels and for apprehending the priests.\" [100] Historian John Watts confirms that this policy was followed by government troops and that, \"In doing so, they appear to have been acting on official orders.\" [99] Thomas Wynne alleges that these official orders actually preceded Culloden, \"A proclamation was on 6th December 1745, putting into operation certain laws which were more or less obsolete - the Act of Queen Elizabeth, cap 27, and of James VI, cap 3, against Jesuits and Catholic priests A reward of £100 was offered every such person, after conviction, within London, Westminster, Southwark, and within ten miles of these places.\" [104]\n\n\nH.M.S. Furnace\nCaptain John Fergussone of H.M.S Furnace was a native of Old Meldrum, near Inverurie (Scottish Gaelic: Inbhir Uaraidh) in Aberdeenshire [129] During the Skirmish of Loch nan Uamh and the later Seven Years' War, he proved very successful as officer commanding in \"those lengthy ship to ship engagements which distinguished naval war in that century\" and his tactical advice to Admiral Edward Boscawen led to the British victory at the 1758 Siege of Louisbourg These all have revealed Captain Fergussone, according to John S Gibson, as \"the very stuff of Britain's naval greatness\" [130] Even so, John Fergussone was also, according to non-juring Scottish Episcopal Church Bishop Robert Forbes, \"a man remarkable for his cruelties.. Even in his younger years he was remarkable for a cruel turn of mind among his school fellows and companions, and therefore he is the fitter tool for William the Cruel.\" [129]\n\n\nDeath and burial\nBy the time HMS Furnace finally reached the Thames and anchored off the coast of Gravesend  as a prison hulk for those too ill to be transferred elsewhere or transported to the British West Indies for sale to the sugar planters, Fr Cameron was already near death By this time, an estimated 900 real and suspected Jacobites were imprisoned aboard the H.M.S Furnace and the other prison hulks anchored in the Thames, under similarly inhumane and insanitary conditions, [166] which are confirmed by Whig eyewitnesses and primary sources, such as the inspection reports of surgeon Dr Minshaw [167]\n\n\nVeneration and Roman Catholic Sainthood Cause\nA fragment of the tartan chasuble worn by Fr Alexander Cameron as he offered Mass on the night before the Battle of Culloden is still preserved as a relic by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Argyll and the Isles at the Manse of St Columba's Cathedral in Oban [98] As of 2011, the relic, which has been donated to the Diocese following Catholic Emancipation in 1829 by Angus John Campbell, 20th hereditary Captain of Dunstaffnage Castle, was on loan to the Clan Cameron Museum at Achnacarry Castle in Lochaber [179]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nScottish Protestant Martyrs\n\n\nCatholic Martyrs\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nBooks\n\n\nPeriodicals\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Alexander Cameron**\n\nAlexander Cameron (17 September 1701 – 1763) was a Scottish Catholic priest who was a prominent member of the Jacobite movement in Scotland during the 18th century. He was a strong advocate for the rights of Catholics and the restoration of the Stuart dynasty to the British throne.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nAlexander Cameron was born on 17 September 1701 at Achnacarry Castle, the seat of the Camerons of Lochiel. He was the son of John Cameron, tanist of Lochiel, and Lady Isobel Campbell of Lochnell. Through his mother, Cameron was a member of the Campbell clan and a descendant of the 7th chief of Clan Stewart of Appin. His family was known for their strong Catholic heritage, and Cameron's early life was marked by a strong sense of devotion to the Catholic faith.\n\n**Family Background**\n\nCameron's mother, Lady Isobel, was a member of the Campbell clan and a descendant of the 7th chief of Clan Stewart of Appin. She was also the younger sister of Sir Donald Campbell, 7th of Lochnell, who was a prominent figure in the Jacobite rising of 1745. Sir Donald was a member of the Independent Highland Companies, which were a group of Highlanders who served in the service of the House of Hanover. He was also a poet and a satirist, and was known for his anti-Whig and anti-Campbell writings.\n\nCameron's maternal uncles were also prominent figures in the Catholic community. One of his uncles, Fr Colin Campbell, was a Catholic priest who was admired for his leadership among his fellow priests in the Highland District. However, he was also known for his private crusade against Jansenism, or Crypto-Calvinism, among the priests of that district, which has been characterized by some historians as a witch hunt.\n\n**Conversion to Catholicism**\n\nCameron's conversion to Catholicism is believed to have been influenced by his family's strong Catholic heritage and his own experiences during his Grand Tour of Europe. He traveled to Rome, where he stayed at the Palazzo Muti, the home and government in exile of Prince James Francis Edward Stuart, also known as the Old Pretender. Through the influence of his uncle, Alan Cameron, Alexander Cameron was granted a position as an honorary gentleman of the bedchamber to the Prince. He would have joined both his Royal master and Maria Clementina Sobieska, the Queen in exile, at formal Roman Feasts, which would also have involved attending the Tridentine Mass when it was accompanied by the liturgical polyphony of Palestrina, Tomas Luis de Vittoria, and many other great composers like them.\n\n**Seminary Studies**\n\nCameron traveled to Douai in 1730, where he studied at the Scots College. In a 1731 Italian language petition to Franz Retz, the Superior General of the Society of Jesus, Cameron explained that he had applied to the Scots College in Douai to be allowed to enter the novitiate in Tournai, but had been told that there was difficulty in admitting him. He reminded the Superior General that he had recently done so for an Irish novice, and asked that the local Jesuit Provincial be ordered to admit him gratis. He also requested that he be exempted from teaching after completing his theology studies, as he was anxious to instead be sent to serve in the missions.\n\n**The Cave in Glen Cannich**\n\nCameron lived with and shared his priestly ministry in Strathglass with two fellow Jesuits whom he had first met as fellow seminarians in Douai. John Farquharson (Scottish Gaelic: Maighstir Iain, an-tAthair Iain Mac Fhearchair) was a veteran \"heather priest\" and early collector of local Scottish Gaelic literature. He often traveled disguised in a kilt and tartan hose to evade capture by the priest hunters. They were also joined by Charles Farquharson (Scottish Gaelic: Maighstir Teàrlach, an t-Athair Teàrlach Mac Fhearchair), Maighstir Iain's brother.\n\n**The Rising**\n\nAccording to a later report by Bishop John Geddes, Cameron and his fellow Catholic priests were hopeful about the Jacobite rising of 1745, which was led by Charles Edward Stuart, also known as Bonnie Prince Charlie. The Jacobites were seeking to restore the Stuart dynasty to the British throne and to bring about Catholic emancipation. Cameron and his fellow priests saw the rising as an opportunity to free themselves and their people from the oppression of the Protestant establishment.\n\n**The Year of the Pillaging**\n\nAfter the Jacobite rising was defeated at the Battle of Culloden in 1746, Cameron and his fellow priests were forced to go into hiding. According to Bishop John Geddes, \"Immediately after the Battle of Culloden, orders were issued for the demolishing all the Catholic chapels and for apprehending the priests.\" Historian John Watts confirms that this policy was followed by government troops and that, \"In doing so, they appear to have been acting on official orders.\" Thomas Wynne alleges that these official orders actually preceded Culloden, \"A proclamation was on 6th December 1745, putting into operation certain laws which were more or less obsolete - the Act of Queen Elizabeth, cap 27, and of James VI, cap 3, against Jesuits and Catholic priests A reward of £100 was offered every such person, after conviction, within London, Westminster, Southwark, and within ten miles of these places.\"\n\n**H.M.S. Furnace**\n\nCaptain John Fergussone of H.M.S Furnace was a native of Old Meldrum, near Inverurie (Scottish Gaelic: Inbhir Uaraidh) in Aberdeenshire. During the Skirmish of Loch nan Uamh and the later Seven Years' War, he proved very successful as officer commanding in \"those lengthy ship to ship engagements which distinguished naval war in that century\" and his tactical advice to Admiral Edward Boscawen led to the British victory at the 1758 Siege of Louisbourg. These all have revealed Captain Fergussone, according to John S Gibson, as \"the very stuff of Britain's naval greatness.\" Even so, John Fergussone was also, according to non-juring Scottish Episcopal Church Bishop Robert Forbes, \"a man remarkable for his cruelties.. Even in his younger years he was remarkable for a cruel turn of mind among his school fellows and companions, and therefore he is the fitter tool for William the Cruel.\"\n\n**Death and Burial**\n\nBy the time HMS Furnace finally reached the Thames and anchored off the coast of Gravesend, Fr Cameron was already near death. By this time, an estimated 900 real and suspected Jacobites were imprisoned aboard the H.M.S Furnace and the other prison hulks anchored in the Thames, under similarly inhumane and insanitary conditions, which are confirmed by Whig eyewitnesses and primary sources, such as the inspection reports of surgeon Dr Minshaw.\n\n**Veneration and Roman Catholic Sainthood Cause**\n\nA fragment of the tartan chasuble worn by Fr Alexander Cameron as he offered Mass on the night before the Battle of Culloden is still preserved as a relic by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Argyll and the Isles at the Manse of St Columba's Cathedral in Oban. As of 2011, the relic, which has been donated to the Diocese following Catholic Emancipation in 1829 by Angus John Campbell, 20th hereditary Captain of Dunstaffnage Castle, was on loan to the Clan Cameron Museum at Achnacarry Castle in Lochaber.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Alexander_Cameron_(priest)\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nAs soon as he was weaned, Cameron was given by his parents in fosterage, as was traditional practice among Irish and Scottish clans, to be raised by relatives within Clan Cameron During the 1754 trial of Alexander Cameron's brother, John Cameron of Fassiefern, the testimony of Donald Cameron of Clunes identified the future priest's foster-father as John MacIngveg (Scottish Gaelic: Iain mac Aonghas Bheag), wadsetter of Glendessary House Clunes further testified, \"According to the customs of the country, Glendessarie (sic) set apart thirty cows, and Lochiel, the father, the like number, and they were all kept at Glendessarie, and the produce of these cows is intended to be for Stock to the infant.. and that when he went abroad, that stock was disposed of, and the price given to Alexander, and that it amounted to £150 Sterling and upwards.\" [31]\n\n\nFamily background\nAlexander Cameron was born on 17 September 1701 [1] at Achnacarry Castle [2] He was son of John Cameron, tanist of Lochiel Alexander Cameron's mother, Lady Isobel Campbell of Lochnell, came from a cadet branch of Clan Campbell and was, through maternal descent, the granddaughter of the 7th chief of Clan Stewart of Appin She was also the younger sister of Sir Donald Campbell, 7th of Lochnell, who commanded one of the Independent Highland Companies in the service of the House of Hanover in the 1745 rising and became important to Scottish Gaelic literature after it ended Sir Donald was named in Jacobite poet Alasdair Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair's 1751 anti-Whig and anti-Campbell satirical Aisling poem An Airc (\"The Ark\") as one of a long list of those whom the Bard viewed as honourable Campbells who, during the second Great Flood prophesied to imminently strike all upon Clan Campbell's lands, were to be welcomed aboard the new Ark [26] [27] Two of Alexander Cameron's other maternal uncles converted to Catholicism One of them was Fr Colin Campbell, who became an admired leader among his fellow outlawed Roman Catholic priests of the Highland District, [3] but whose private crusade against Jansenism, or Crypto-Calvinism, among the priests of that same District has since been characterized, by at least one recent historian, as a witch hunt [28]\n\n\nEarly life\nAs soon as he was weaned, Cameron was given by his parents in fosterage, as was traditional practice among Irish and Scottish clans, to be raised by relatives within Clan Cameron During the 1754 trial of Alexander Cameron's brother, John Cameron of Fassiefern, the testimony of Donald Cameron of Clunes identified the future

he went abroad, that stock was disposed of, and the price given to Alexander, and that it amounted to £150 Sterling and upwards.\" [31]\n\n\nConversion to Catholicism\nAfter this, Alexander Cameron travelled on a Grand Tour throughout Europe After arriving in the Papal States, Alexander Cameron stayed at the Palazzo Muti in Rome, the home and the government in exile of Prince James Francis Edward Stuart, who was known to Whigs as \"The Old Pretender\" and to Jacobites as, \"The King over the Water.\" Through the influence of his uncle, Alan Cameron, Alexander Cameron was granted a position as an honorary gentleman of the bedchamber to the Prince He would have joined both his Royal master and Maria Clementina Sobieska, the Queen in exile, at formal Roman Feasts, which would also have involved attending the Tridentine Mass when it was accompanied by the liturgical polyphony of Palestrina, Tomas Luis de Vittoria, and many other great composers like them These experiences are believed to have had an enormous influence upon his future spiritual development [3] [42]\n\n\nSeminary studies\nAlexander Cameron travelled to Douai in 1730 In a 1731 Italian language petition to Franz Retz, the Superior General of the Society of Jesus, and which still survives, Cameron explained that he had applied to the Scots College in Douai to be allowed to enter the novitiate in Tournai, but had been told that there was difficulty in admitting him There was already another Scottish novice studying in Tournai and the Scots College could not afford to pay 300 florins a year for another Reminding the Superior General that he had recently done so for an Irish novice, Cameron asked that the local Jesuit Provincial be ordered to admit him gratis Cameron also requested, as he was already somewhat older than the usual Jesuit postulant, that he be exempted from teaching after completing his theology studies, as he was also anxious to instead be sent to serve in the missions [54]\n\n\nThe cave in Glen Cannich\nCameron lived with and shared his priestly ministry in Strathglass with two fellow Jesuits whom he had first met as fellow seminarians in Douai [60] John

Iain's brother \n\n\nThe Rising\nAccording to a later report by Bishop John Geddes, as outlawed clergymen of an illegal and underground church denomination, it is understandable why both Bishop Hugh MacDonald and Alexander Cameron would have felt very hopeful about Jacobitism, due the House of Stuart's promises of Catholic Emancipation, freedom of religion, and civil rights to everyone outside the Established Churches of the realm It is equally understandable why the Scottish Catholic laity, who, \"were discouraged and much exposed to oppression\", would similarly, \"wish for an event that was likely to release them, and put them again into the possession of the privileges of free-born citizens.\" [86]\n\n\nThe Year of the Pillaging\nAccording to Bishop John Geddes, \"Immediately after the Battle of Culloden, orders were issued for the demolishing all the Catholic chapels and for apprehending the priests.\" [100] Historian John Watts confirms that this policy was followed by

Monmouth [2] He was the son of Henry of Bolingbroke (later Henry IV of England) and Mary de Bohun His father's cousin was the reigning English monarch, Richard II Henry's paternal grandfather was the influential John of Gaunt, a son of Edward III As he was not close to the line of succession to the throne, Henry's date of birth was not officially documented, and for many years it was disputed whether he was born in 1386 or 1387 [3] However, records indicate that his younger brother Thomas was born in the autumn of 1387 and that his parents were at Monmouth in 1386 but not in 1387 [4] It is now accepted that he was born on 16 September 1386 [5] [6] [7] [11]\n\n\nBirth and family\nHenry was born in the tower above the gatehouse of Monmouth Castle in Monmouthshire, and for that reason was

1386 but not in 1387 [4] It is now accepted that he was born on 16 September 1386 [5] [6] [7] [11]\n\n\nEarly military career and role in Government\nFrom 1400 to 1404, he carried out the duties of High Sheriff of Cornwall During that time, Henry was also in command of part of the English forces He led his own army into Wales against Owain Glyndŵr and joined forces with his father to fight Henry \"Hotspur\" Percy at the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403 [15] It was there that the 16-year-old prince was almost killed by an arrow in his left cheekbone An ordinary soldier might have died from such a wound, but Henry had the benefit of the best possible care Over a period of several days, John Bradmore, the royal physician, treated the wound with honey to act as an antiseptic, crafted a tool to screw into the embedded arrowhead (bodkin point) and thus extract it without doing further damage, and flushed the wound with alcohol [16] The operation was successful, but it left Henry with permanent scars - evidence of his experience in battle [17] Bradmore recorded this account in Latin, in his manuscript titled Philomena Henry's treatment also appeared in an anonymous Middle English surgical treatise dated to 1446, that has since been attributed to Thomas Morstede.\n\n\nReign (1413–1422)\nAfter Henry IV died on 20 March 1413, Henry V succeeded him and was crowned on 9 April 1413 at Westminster Abbey The ceremony was marked by a terrible snowstorm, but the common people were undecided as to whether it was a good or bad omen [20] Henry was described as having been \"very tall (6 feet 3 inches), slim, with dark hair cropped in a ring above the ears, and clean-shaven\" His complexion was ruddy, his face lean with a prominent and pointed nose Depending on his mood, his eyes \"flashed from the mildness of a dove's to the brilliance of a lion's\" [21]\n\n\nAccession\nAfter Henry IV died on 20 March 1413, Henry V succeeded him and was crowned on 9 April 1413 at Westminster

from the mildness of a dove's to the brilliance of a lion's\" [21]\n\n\nDomestic affairs\nHenry tackled all of the domestic policies together and gradually built on them a wider policy From the first, he made it clear that he would rule England as the head of a united nation He let past differences be forgotten—the late Richard II was honourably re-interred; the young Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, was taken into favour; the heirs of those who had suffered under the last reign were restored gradually to their titles and estates Yet, where Henry saw a grave domestic danger, he acted firmly and ruthlessly, such as during the Lollard discontent in January 1414 and including the execution by burning of Henry's old friend, Sir John Oldcastle, in 1417 to \"nip the movement in the bud\" and make his own position as ruler secure [12]\n\n\nWar in France\nHenry could now turn his attention to foreign affairs A writer of the next generation was the first to allege that Henry was encouraged by ecclesiastical statesmen to enter into the French war as a means of diverting attention from home troubles This story seems to have no foundation Old commercial disputes and the support the French had lent to Owain Glyndŵr were used as an excuse for war, while the disordered state of France afforded no security for peace [12] King Charles VI of France was prone to mental illness; at times he thought he was made of glass, and his eldest surviving son, Louis, Duke of Guyenne, was an unpromising prospect However, it was the old dynastic claim to the throne of France, first pursued by Edward III of England, that justified war with France in English opinion.\n\n\nDispute with France\nHenry could now turn his attention to foreign affairs A writer of the next generation was the first to

throne of France, first pursued by Edward III of England, that justified war with France in English opinion.\n\n\n1415 campaign\nOn 12 August 1415, Henry sailed for France, where his forces besieged the fortress at Harfleur, capturing it on 22 September Afterwards, he decided to march with his army across the French countryside toward Calais against the warnings of his council [25] On 25 October, on the plains near the village of Agincourt, a French army intercepted his route Despite his men-at-arms' being exhausted, outnumbered and malnourished, Henry led his men into battle, decisively defeating the French, who suffered severe losses The French men-at-arms were bogged down in the muddy battlefield, soaked from the previous night of heavy rain, thus hindering the French advance and making them sitting targets for the flanking English archers [25] Most were simply hacked to death while completely stuck in the deep mud It was Henry's greatest military victory, ranking alongside the Battle of Crécy (1346) and the Battle of Poitiers (1356) as the greatest English victories of the Hundred Years' War This victory both solidified and strengthened Henry V's own rule in England and also legitimized his claim to the French throne more than ever [26]\n\n\nDiplomacy\nFollowing the Battle of Agincourt, King Sigismund of Hungary (later Holy Roman Emperor) made a visit to Henry in hopes of making peace between England and France His goal was to persuade Henry to modify his demands against the French Henry lavishly entertained him and even had him enrolled in the Order of the Garter Sigismund, in turn, inducted Henry into the Order of the Dragon [28] Henry had intended to crusade for the order after uniting the English and French thrones, but he died before fulfilling his plans [29] [30] [31] Sigismund left England several months later, having signed the Treaty of Canterbury acknowledging English claims to France.\n\n\n1417–1421 campaigns\nWith those two potential enemies gone, and after two years of patient preparation following the Battle of Agincourt, Henry renewed the war on a larger scale in 1417 After taking Caen, he quickly conquered Lower Normandy and Rouen was cut off from Paris and besieged This siege has cast an even darker shadow on the reputation of the king adding to the loss of honor following his order to slay the French prisoners at Agincourt The leaders of Rouen, who were unable to support and feed the women and children of the town, forced them out through the gates believing that Henry would allow them to pass through his army unmolested However, Henry refused to allow this, and the expelled women and children died of starvation in the ditches surrounding the town The French were paralysed by the disputes between the Burgundians and the Armagnacs Henry skillfully played one against the other without relaxing his warlike approach [12]\n\n\nDeath\nHenry V died on 31 August 1422 at the Château de Vincennes to the east of Paris [34] The commonly held view is that Henry V contracted dysentery in the period just after the Siege of Meaux, which ended on 9 May 1422 However, the symptoms and severity of dysentery present themselves fairly quickly and he seems to have been healthy in the weeks following the siege At the time, speculative causes of his illness also included smallpox, the bacterial infection erysipelas and even leprosy But there is no doubt he had contracted a serious illness sometime between May and June Recovering at the castle of Vincennes, by the end of June it seems he was well enough to lead his forces with the intent of engaging the Dauphinist forces at Cosne-sur-Loire At the outset, he would have been riding in full armour, probably in blistering heat, as the summer of 1422 was extremely hot He was struck down again, with a debilitating fever, possibly heatstroke or a relapse of his previous illness Whatever the cause or causes, he would not recover from this final bout of illness For a few short weeks he was carried around in a litter, and his enemies having retreated, he decided to return to Paris One story has him trying, one last time, to mount a horse at Charenton and failing He was taken back to Vincennes, around 10 August, where he died some weeks later He was 35 years old and had reigned for nine years Shortly before his death, Henry V named his brother, John, Duke of Bedford, regent of France in the name of his son, Henry VI of England, then only a few months old Henry V did not live to be crowned King of France himself, as he might confidently have expected after the Treaty of Troyes, because Charles VI, to whom he had been named heir, survived him by two months.\n\n\nLegacy\nHenry V's death at thirty-five years of age was a political and dynastic turning point for both the kingdoms of England and France The Lancastrian ruler had been set to rule both realms after Charles VI's death, which occurred in October 1422, less than two months after Henry's own premature death This caused his infant son, also called Henry, to ascend the throne as King Henry VI of England, at the age of nine months Due to the new king's age, a regency government was formed by Henry's surviving brothers, John, Duke of Bedford, and Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester This acted as the sole governing force of England and its possessions in France until Henry VI came of age in 1437 Although for a time this largely proved to be a success, with England achieving their greatest territorial extent in France under the command of Bedford, [36] [37] the later reign of Henry VI saw the majority of the territories held by the English lost or returned to the French, through reconquest or diplomatic secession; [38] [39] English military power in the region eventually ceased to exist [40] [41] This marked the end of England's sustained military success in the Hundred Years' War, with all their historic possessions and land in France being lost, with the exception of the Pale of Calais, which remained England's only foothold in the continent until it was lost in 1558 [42] The loss of land in France was a major contributing factor in causing Henry V's heirs and relatives to descend into civil strife and quarrel over the succession of the English crown in ensuing decades, culminating in the Wars of the Roses (1455–1487) between Henry V's descendants, the House of Lancaster, and its rival, the House of York [43]\n\n\nPolitical\nHenry V's death at thirty-five years of age was a political and dynastic turning point for both the kingdoms

above the gatehouse of Monmouth Castle in Monmouthshire, and for that reason was sometimes called Henry of Monmouth. He was the son of Henry of Bolingbroke (later Henry IV of England) and Mary de Bohun. His father's cousin was the reigning English monarch, Richard II. Henry's paternal grandfather was the influential John of Gaunt, a son of Edward III. As he was not close to the line of succession to the throne, Henry's date of birth was not officially documented, and for many years it was disputed whether he was born in 1386 or 1387. However, records indicate that his younger brother Thomas was born in the autumn of 1387 and that his parents were at Monmouth in 1386 but not in 1387. It is now accepted that he was born on 16 September 1386.\n\n**Birth and Family**\n\nHenry was born in the tower above the gatehouse of Monmouth Castle in Monmouthshire, and for that reason was sometimes called Henry of Monmouth.

It is now accepted that he was born on 16 September 1386.\n\n**Early Military Career and Role in Government**\n\nFrom 1400 to 1404, he carried out the duties of High Sheriff of Cornwall. During that time, Henry was also in command of part of the English forces. He led his own army into Wales against Owain Glyndŵr and joined forces with his father to fight Henry \"Hotspur\" Percy at the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403. It was there that the 16-year-old prince was almost killed by an arrow in his left cheekbone. An ordinary soldier might have died from such a wound, but Henry had the benefit of the best possible care. Over a period of several days, John Bradmore, the royal physician, treated the wound with honey to act as an antiseptic, crafted a tool to screw into the embedded arrowhead (bodkin point) and thus extract it without doing further damage, and flushed the wound with alcohol. The operation was successful, but it left Henry with permanent scars - evidence of his experience in battle. Bradmore recorded this account in Latin, in his manuscript titled Philomena. Henry's treatment also appeared in an anonymous Middle English surgical treatise dated to 1446, that has since been attributed to Thomas Morstede.\n\n**Reign (1413–1422)**\n\nAfter Henry IV died on 20 March 1413, Henry V succeeded him and was crowned on 9 April 1413 at Westminster Abbey. The ceremony was marked by a terrible snowstorm, but the common people were undecided as to whether it was a good or bad omen. Henry was described as having been \"very tall (6 feet 3 inches), slim, with dark hair cropped in a ring above the ears, and clean-shaven\". His complexion was ruddy, his face lean with a prominent and pointed nose. Depending on his mood, his eyes \"flashed from the mildness of a dove's to the brilliance of a lion's\".\n\n**Accession**\n\nAfter Henry IV died on 20 March 1413, Henry V succeeded him and was crowned on 9 April 1413 at Westminster Abbey.

Henry was described as having been \"very tall (6 feet 3 inches), slim, with dark hair cropped in a ring above the ears, and clean-shaven\". His complexion was ruddy, his face lean with a prominent and pointed nose. Depending on his mood, his eyes \"flashed from the mildness of a dove's to the brilliance of a lion's\".\n\n**Domestic Affairs**\n\nHenry tackled all of the domestic policies together and gradually built on them a wider policy. From the first, he made it clear that he would rule England as the head of a united nation. He let past differences be forgotten—the late Richard II was honourably re-interred; the young Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, was taken into favour; the heirs of those who had suffered under the last reign were restored gradually to their titles and estates. Yet, where Henry saw a grave domestic danger, he acted firmly and ruthlessly, such as during the Lollard discontent in January 1414 and including the execution by burning of Henry's old friend, Sir John Oldcastle, in 1417 to \"nip the movement in the bud\" and make his own position as ruler secure.\n\n**War in France**\n\nHenry could now turn his attention to foreign affairs. A writer of the next generation was the first to allege that Henry was encouraged by ecclesiastical statesmen to enter into the French war as a means of diverting attention from home troubles. This story seems to have no foundation. Old commercial disputes and the support the French had lent to Owain Glyndŵr were used as an excuse for war, while the disordered state of France afforded no security for peace. King Charles VI of France was prone to mental illness; at times he thought he was made of glass, and his eldest surviving son, Louis, Duke of Guyenne, was an unpromising prospect. However, it was the old dynastic claim to the throne of France, first pursued by Edward III of England, that justified war with France in English opinion.\n\n**Dispute with France**\n\nHenry could now turn his attention to foreign affairs. A writer of the next generation was the first to allege that Henry was encouraged by ecclesiastical statesmen to enter into the French war as a means of diverting attention from home troubles.

However, it was the old dynastic claim to the throne of France, first pursued by Edward III of England, that justified war with France in English opinion.\n\n**1415 Campaign**\n\nOn 12 August 1415, Henry sailed for France, where his forces besieged the fortress at Harfleur, capturing it on 22 September. Afterwards, he decided to march with his army across the French countryside toward Calais against the warnings of his council. On 25 October, on the plains near the village of Agincourt, a French army intercepted his route. Despite his men-at-arms' being exhausted, outnumbered and malnourished, Henry led his men into battle, decisively defeating the French, who suffered severe losses. The French men-at-arms were bogged down in the muddy battlefield, soaked from the previous night of heavy rain, thus hindering the French advance and making them sitting targets for the flanking English archers. Most were simply hacked to death while completely stuck in the deep mud. It was Henry's greatest military victory, ranking alongside the Battle of Crécy (1346) and the Battle of Poitiers (1356) as the greatest English victories of the Hundred Years' War. This victory both solidified and strengthened Henry V's own rule in England and also legitimized his claim to the French throne more than ever.\n\n**Diplomacy**\n\nFollowing the Battle of Agincourt, King Sigismund of Hungary (later Holy Roman Emperor) made a visit to Henry in hopes of making peace between England and France. His goal was to persuade Henry to modify his demands against the French. Henry lavishly entertained him and even had him enrolled in the Order of the Garter. Sigismund, in turn, inducted Henry into the Order of the Dragon. Henry had intended to crusade for the order after uniting the English and French thrones, but he died before fulfilling his plans.\n\n**1417–1421 Campaigns**\n\nWith those two potential enemies gone, and after two years of patient preparation following the Battle of Agincourt, Henry renewed the war on a larger scale in 1417. After taking Caen, he quickly conquered Lower Normandy and Rouen was cut off from Paris and besieged. This siege has cast an even darker shadow on the reputation of the king adding to the loss of honor following his order to slay the French prisoners at Agincourt. The leaders of Rouen, who were unable to support and feed the women and children of the town, forced them out through the gates believing that Henry would allow them to pass through his army unmolested. However, Henry refused to allow this, and the expelled women and children died of starvation in the ditches surrounding the town. The French were paralysed by the disputes between the Burgundians and the Armagnacs. Henry skillfully played one against the other without relaxing his warlike approach.\n\n**Death**\n\nHenry V died on 31 August 1422 at the Château de Vincennes to the east of Paris. The commonly held view is that Henry V contracted dysentery in the period just after the Siege of Meaux, which ended on 9 May 1422. However, the symptoms and severity of dysentery present themselves fairly quickly and he seems to have been healthy in the weeks following the siege. At the time, speculative causes of his illness also included smallpox, the bacterial infection erysipelas and even leprosy. But there is no doubt he had contracted a serious illness sometime between May and June. Recovering at the castle of Vincennes, by the end of June it seems he was well enough to lead his forces with the intent of engaging the Dauphinist forces at Cosne-sur-Loire. At the outset, he would have been riding in full armour, probably in blistering heat, as the summer of 1422 was extremely hot. He was struck down again, with a debilitating fever, possibly heatstroke or a relapse of his previous illness. Whatever the cause or causes, he would not recover from this final bout of illness. For a few short weeks he was carried around in a litter, and his enemies having retreated, he decided to return to Paris. One story has him trying, one last time, to mount a horse at Charenton and failing. He was taken back to Vincennes, around 10 August, where he died some weeks later. He was 35 years old and had reigned for nine years. Shortly before his death, Henry V named his brother, John, Duke of Bedford, regent of France in the name of his son, Henry VI of England, then only a few months old. Henry V did not live to be crowned King of France himself, as he might confidently have expected after the Treaty of Troyes, because Charles VI, to whom he had been named heir, survived him by two months.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nHenry V's death at thirty-five years of age was a political and dynastic turning point for both the kingdoms of England and France. The Lancastrian ruler had been set to rule both realms after Charles VI's death, which occurred in October 1422, less than two months after Henry's own premature death. This caused his infant son, also called Henry, to ascend the throne as King Henry VI of England, at the age of nine months. Due to the new king's age, a regency government was formed by Henry's surviving brothers, John, Duke of Bedford, and Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester. This acted as the sole governing force of England and its possessions in France until Henry VI came of age in 1437. Although for a time this largely proved to be a success, with England achieving their greatest territorial extent in France under the command of Bedford, the later reign of Henry VI saw the majority of the territories held by the English lost or returned to the French, through reconquest or diplomatic secession. English military power in the region eventually ceased to exist. This marked the end of England's sustained military success in the Hundred Years' War, with all their historic possessions and land in France being lost, with the exception of the Pale of Calais, which remained England's only foothold in the continent until it was lost in 1558. The loss of land in France was a major contributing factor in causing Henry V's heirs and relatives to descend into civil strife and quarrel over the succession of the English crown in ensuing decades, culminating in the Wars of the Roses (1455–1487) between Henry V's descendants, the House of Lancaster, and its rival, the House of York.\n\n**Reputation**\n\nHenry V is remembered by both his countrymen and his foes as a capable military commander during the war against France and is one of the most renowned monarchs in English and British history.

with the exception of the Pale of Calais, which remained England's only foothold in the continent until it was lost in 1558 [42] The loss of land in France was a major contributing factor in causing Henry V's heirs and relatives to descend into civil strife and quarrel over the succession of the English crown in ensuing decades, culminating in the Wars of the Roses (1455–1487) between Henry V's descendants, the House of Lancaster, and its rival, the House of York [43]\n\n\nPolitical\nHenry V's death at thirty-five years of age was a political and dynastic turning point for both the kingdoms of England and France The Lancastrian ruler had been set to rule both realms after Charles VI's death, which occurred in October 1422, less than two months after Henry's own premature death This caused his infant son, also called Henry, to ascend the throne as King Henry VI of England, at the age of nine months Due to the new king's age, a regency government was formed by Henry's surviving brothers, John, Duke of Bedford, and Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester This acted as the sole governing force of England and its possessions in France until Henry VI came of age in 1437 Although for a time this largely proved to be a success, with England achieving their greatest territorial extent in France under the command of Bedford, [36] [37] the later reign of Henry VI saw the majority of the territories held by the English lost or returned to the French, through reconquest or diplomatic secession; [38] [39] English military power in the region eventually ceased to exist [40] [41] This marked the end of England's sustained military success in the Hundred Years' War, with all their historic possessions and land in France being lost, with the exception of the Pale of Calais, which

rival, the House of York [43]\n\n\nReputation\nHenry V is remembered by both his countrymen and his foes as a capable military commander during the war against France and is one of the most renowned monarchs in English and British history He is largely seen as a symbol of English military might and power, which inspired later kings and queens of England His effect on English history, culture, and the military is profound His victory at Agincourt significantly impacted the war against the French and led to the English capturing most of northern France This led to the Treaty of Troyes in 1420, in which Charles VI of France appointed Henry his successor, although Henry died two months before Charles in October 1422 Henry's victories created a national sensation and caused a patriotic fervour among the English people that would go on to influence both the medieval English army and the British army for centuries to come His continuous victories against the French during 1417–1422 led to many romanticized depictions of Henry V as a figure of nationalism and patriotism, both in literature and in the renowned works of Shakespeare and in the film industry in modern times [44]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nHenry V was often a figure of literary imagination and romantic interpretations, often used as a traditional character of a morally great king in the works of many writers, playwrights and dramatists This is notably so in his depiction in Henry V, a play largely based on the life of Henry V by William Shakespeare This and other plays about Richard II, Henry V's father Henry IV and son Henry VI are known as the Henriad in Shakespearean scholarship It depicts the king as a pious but cunning ruler who ventured on a campaign to France to become heir to the French throne This largely acquainted audiences and the wider population with the king's reign and his character as a whole [45]\n\n\nIn literature\nHenry V was often a figure of literary imagination and

in the 1989 film Henry V, for which he was nominated for the  Academy Award for Best Actor, Best Director, and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role [47] Henry V appears as a major character played by Keith Baxter in Orson Welles's 1966 film Chimes at Midnight He is also played by Timothée Chalamet in 2019 Netflix film The King directed by David Michôd He is portrayed by Tom

a paladin.\n\n\nArms\nHenry's arms as Prince of Wales were those of the kingdom, differenced by a label argent of three points [48] Upon his accession, he inherited the use of the arms of the kingdom undifferenced.\n\n\nMarriage\nAfter his father became king, Henry was created Prince of Wales It was suggested that Henry should marry the widow of Richard II, Isabella of Valois, but this had been refused After this, negotiations took place for his marriage to Catherine of Pomerania between 1401 and 1404, but ultimately failed [49]\n\n\nAncestry and family\n\n\nDescent\n\n\nSee

It is a long-range, precision-guided missile designed for land-attack and anti-ship missions. The Storm Shadow has been used by various military forces, including the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the French Air and Space Force (FASF).\n\n**Characteristics**\n\nThe Storm Shadow missile weighs approximately 1,300 kilograms (2,900 pounds) and has a conventional warhead of 450 kilograms (990 pounds). It has a maximum body diameter of 48 centimeters (19 inches) and a wingspan of three meters (120 inches). The missile is propelled at Mach 0.8 by a Microturbo TRI 60-30 turbojet engine and has a range of approximately 560 kilometers (350 miles).\n\n**History**\n\nThe development of the Storm Shadow began in the 1990s, when Matra and British Aerospace were selected as the prime contractors for the Conventionally Armed Standoff Missile (CASOM) program. The Storm Shadow design was based on Matra's Apache anti-runway cruise missile. A development and production contract was signed in February 1997, by which time Matra and BAe had completed the merger of their missile businesses to form Matra BAe Dynamics.\n\nFrance ordered 500 SCALP missiles in January 1998. The SCALP/Storm Shadow was intended to replace the FASF's and RAF's existing air-launched cruise missiles, such as the Exocet and the AGM-86B. The first operational use of the Storm Shadow occurred during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, when RAF Tornados used the missile against targets in Iraq.\n\n**Use by Ukraine**\n\nOn May 11, 2023, the United Kingdom announced that it was supplying Storm Shadows to the Ukrainian military during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This followed a pledge from the UK in February 2023 to send Ukraine long-range missiles in response to Russian strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure. Ukraine has insisted that it would not use such weapons on Russian territory.\n\n**Export Variant**\n\nThe export variant of the Storm Shadow is known as the Black Shaheen, which was developed for use with the United Arab Emirates' Mirage 2000 aircraft. Modifications were made to reduce the range of the Black Shaheen to 290 kilometers (180 miles) in order to comply with Missile Technology Control Regime guidelines.\n\n**MdCN**\n\nIn 2006, MBDA France began the development of a more potent deep strike naval cruise missile, which became operational in 2017 on the French FREMM multipurpose frigates. The MdCN, formerly known as SCALP Naval, uses a booster during its launch phase to break out of the ship and gain some initial velocity.

The PVC is considered the highest military honor in India and is awarded to members of the Indian Armed Forces, as well as civilians who have demonstrated exceptional bravery in the face of the enemy.\n\n**History**\n\nThe history of modern-day Indian gallantry awards can be traced back to the rule of the East India Company. Gold medals were awarded to Indian officers for the first time in 1795, with the first recipient being Subedar Abdul Kader of the 5th Madras Native Infantry. The chain of the gold medal awarded to Kader was inscribed with the words \"For Conduct and Courage on All Occasions.\" In 1834, the Order of Merit was established by the then Governor-General of India, Lord William Bentinck. The decoration was renamed the Indian Order of Merit (IOM) in 1902, and Indians considered it to be \"the most coveted gallantry award\" until the Victoria Cross (VC) – the highest award for gallantry in the British Empire – was extended to Indians in 1911.

Born into a family with a long history in Florence, Italy, Aldo went on to play a significant role in shaping the company's success. This article provides an in-depth look at his life, career, and personal experiences.\n\nEarly Life and Family\n--------------------\n\nAldo Gucci was born on 26 May 1905 in Florence, Italy, into a Tuscan family dating back to the thirteenth century in the nearby town of San Miniato. He was the eldest of children born to Aida Calvelli and Guccio Gucci. Aldo had three brothers – Vasco, Rodolfo, and Enzo (who died aged nine) – and a sister, Grimalda. He also had a half-brother, Ugo, from his mother's previous relationship. After Enzo's death, Aldo became the eldest child in the family.\n\nAldo's early life was marked by a strong sense of family tradition and a deep connection to the Gucci brand. His father, Guccio, was a skilled leather goods maker who had founded the Gucci company in 1921. Aldo's upbringing and education instilled in him a passion for entrepreneurship and a desire to contribute to the family business.\n\nCareer\n-------\n\nAldo began working full-time at Gucci from the age of 20, where he quickly demonstrated his talent and dedication to the brand. In 1938, Aldo opened the first Gucci shop outside of Florence, in Rome. This marked a significant milestone in the company's expansion and cemented Aldo's position as a key figure in the Gucci organization.\n\nThroughout his career, Aldo played a crucial role in shaping the Gucci brand's identity and direction. He was instrumental in introducing new products and expanding the company's reach into international markets. Aldo's vision and leadership helped the Gucci brand become synonymous with luxury and style, appealing to a wide range of consumers worldwide.\n\nLater Years\n------------\n\nAfter the death of their brother Vasco in 1974, Rodolfo and Aldo divided the business between themselves, 50/50. However, Aldo's sons felt that Rodolfo had not contributed enough to the growth of the business. In an attempt to increase his profits, Aldo set up a perfume subsidiary and held 80 per cent of its ownership for himself and his three sons. This rivalry eventually spiralled into family warfare, with tensions between Aldo and his son Giorgio coming to a head.\n\nPersonal Life and Death\n----------------------\n\nAldo married Olwen Price on 22 August 1927, and together they had three sons – Giorgio, Paolo, and Roberto. However, Aldo's personal life was also marked by an extra-marital affair with Bruna Palombo, with whom he had a daughter, Patricia, in 1963. Despite never divorcing Olwen in Italy, Aldo married Bruna in 1981 in America.\n\nAldo's personal life was characterized by a sense of extravagance and excess, with a penchant for luxury and a love of fine things. He had homes in New York City, Palm Beach, Rome, Florence, Beverly Hills, London, and Paris, reflecting his high-society status and his love of travel.\n\nAldo Gucci died in Rome on 19 January 1990, at the age of 84, due to complications from prostate cancer. He was buried in the family mausoleum in Florence, surrounded by his loved ones and the memories of a life well-lived.\n\nArms\n----\n\nGuccio Gucci, his eldest living biological son, Aldo Gucci, Aldo Gucci's sons, Giorgio Gucci, Paolo Gucci, and Roberto Gucci, and grandson Uberto Gucci claimed the right to use an inherited, ancestral coat of arms after the Kingdom of Italy, which was ruled by the House of Savoy, transitioned to the Italian Republic in 1946.\n\nIn Popular Culture\n------------------\n\nAldo Gucci's life and legacy have been immortalized in the 2021 film \"House of Gucci,\" directed by Ridley Scott and starring Al Pacino as Aldo. The film explores the Gucci family's rise to fame and their subsequent downfall, offering a gripping portrayal of the Gucci brand's history.\n\nOverall, Aldo Gucci's life was marked by a deep connection to his family and the Gucci brand, as well as a passion for entrepreneurship and a desire to succeed. His legacy continues to shape the Gucci brand, and his story remains an integral part of the company's history and identity.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Aldo_Gucci\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and family\nAldo Gucci was born on 26 May 1905 in Florence, into a Tuscan family dating back to the thirteenth century in the nearby town of San Miniato [1] He had three brothers – Vasco, Rodolfo, and Enzo (who died aged nine) – and a sister, Grimalda He also had a half-brother, Ugo, from his mother's previous relationship After Enzo had died at nine, Aldo was the eldest of children born to Aida Calvelli and Guccio Gucci [2]\n\n\nCareer\nFrom the age of 20, Aldo began work full-time at Gucci He went on to open the first shop outside of Florence, in Rome in 1938 [2] [4]\n\n\nLater years\nAfter their brother Vasco Gucci died in 1974, Rodolfo and Aldo divided the business between themselves 50/50 However, Aldo's sons felt that Rodolfo had not contributed enough to the growth of the business In an attempt to increase his profits, Aldo set up a perfume subsidiary and held 80 per cent of its ownership for himself and his three sons This rivalry eventually spiralled into family warfare [7]\n\n\nPersonal life and death\nAldo married Olwen Price on 22 August 1927, together they had three sons – Giorgio, Paolo and Roberto [14] He had an extra-marital affair with Bruna Palombo, together they had a daughter Patricia in 1963 [15]  Aldo married Bruna in 1981 in America, despite never divorcing Olwen in Italy [16] [17] He had homes in New York City, Palm Beach, Rome, [18] Florence, Beverly Hills, London, and Paris [3] Aldo Gucci died in Rome at the age of 84 of prostate cancer, on 19 January 1990 [19] He was buried in the family mausoleum in Florence [19]\n\n\nArms\nGuccio Gucci; his eldest living biological son, Aldo Gucci; Aldo Gucci's sons, Giorgio Gucci, Paolo Gucci, and Roberto Gucci; and grandson Uberto Gucci claimed the right to use an inherited, ancestral coat of arms after the Kingdom of Italy, which was ruled by the House of Savoy, transitioned to the Italian Republic in 1946 [20]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nIn the film House of Gucci (2021), Aldo Gucci is played by American actor Al Pacino [23]\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "David_Bowie", "content": "\nEarly life\nDavid Robert Jones was born on 8 January 1947 in Brixton, London [2] His mother, Margaret Mary \"Peggy\" (née Burns), [3] was born at Shorncliffe Army Camp near Cheriton, Kent [4] Her paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants who had settled in Manchester [5] She worked as a waitress at a cinema in Royal Tunbridge Wells [6] His father, Haywood Stenton \"John\" Jones, [3] was from Doncaster, Yorkshire, [7] and worked as a promotions officer for the children's charity Barnardo's The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road, on the boundary between Brixton and Stockwell in the south London borough of Lambeth Bowie attended Stockwell Infants School until he was six, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child—and a defiant brawler [8]\n\n\nMusic career\nBowie formed his first band, the Konrads, in 1962 at the age of 15 Playing guitar-based rock and roll at local youth gatherings and weddings, the Konrads had a varying line-up of between four and eight members, Underwood among them [24] When Bowie left the technical school the following year, he informed his parents of his intention to become a pop star His mother arranged his employment as an electrician's mate Frustrated by his bandmates' limited aspirations, Bowie left the Konrads and joined another band, the King Bees He wrote to the newly successful washing-machine entrepreneur John Bloom inviting him to \"do for us what Brian Epstein has done for the Beatles—and make another million.\" Bloom did not respond to the offer, but his referral to Dick James's partner Leslie Conn led to Bowie's first personal management contract [25]\n\n\n1962–1967: Early career to debut album\nBowie formed his first band, the Konrads, in 1962 at the age of 15

Beatles—and make another million.\" Bloom did not respond to the offer, but his referral to Dick James's partner Leslie Conn led to Bowie's first personal management contract [25]\n\n\n1968–1971: Space Oddity to Hunky Dory\n\nStudying the dramatic arts under Lindsay Kemp, from avant-garde theatre and mime to commedia dell'arte, Bowie became immersed in the creation of personae to present to the world Satirising life in a British prison, his composition \"Over the Wall We Go\" became a 1967 single for Oscar; another Bowie song, \"Silly Boy Blue\", was released by Billy Fury the following year [38] Playing acoustic guitar, Hermione Farthingale formed a group with Bowie and guitarist John Hutchinson named Feathers; between September 1968 and early 1969 the trio gave a small number of concerts combining folk, Merseybeat, poetry and mime [39]\n\n\n1972–1974: Glam rock era\nDressed in a striking costume, his hair dyed reddish-brown, Bowie launched his Ziggy Stardust stage show with the Spiders from Mars—Ronson, Bolder, and Woodmansey—at the Toby Jug pub in Tolworth in Kingston upon Thames on 10 February 1972 [70] The show was hugely popular, catapulting him to stardom as he toured the UK over the next six months and creating, as described by David Buckley, a \"cult of Bowie\" that was \"unique—its influence lasted longer and has been more creative than perhaps almost any other force within pop fandom.\" [70] The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), combining the hard rock elements of The Man Who Sold the World with the lighter experimental rock and pop of Hunky Dory, was released in June and was considered one of the defining albums of glam rock \"Starman\", issued as an April single ahead of the album, was to cement Bowie's UK breakthrough: both single and album charted rapidly following his July Top of the Pops performance of the song The album, which remained in the chart for two years, was soon joined there by the six-month-old Hunky Dory At the same time, the non-album single \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" and \"All the Young Dudes\", a song he wrote and produced for Mott the Hoople, [71] were successful in the UK The Ziggy Stardust Tour continued to the United States [72]\n\n\n1974–1976: \"Plastic soul\" and the Thin White Duke\nBowie moved to the US in 1974, initially staying in New York City before settling in Los Angeles [83] Diamond Dogs (1974), parts of which found him heading towards soul and funk, was the product of two distinct ideas: a musical based on a wild future in a post-apocalyptic city, and setting George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four to music [84] The album went to number one in the UK, spawning the hits \"Rebel Rebel\" and \"Diamond Dogs\", and number five in the US The supporting Diamond Dogs Tour visited cities in North America between June and December 1974 Choreographed by Toni Basil, and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects, the high-budget stage production was filmed by Alan Yentob The resulting documentary, Cracked Actor, featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided with his slide from heavy cocaine use into addiction, producing severe physical debilitation, paranoia and emotional problems [85] He later commented that the accompanying live album, David Live, ought to have been titled \"David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only in Theory\" [86] David Live nevertheless solidified Bowie's status as a superstar, charting at number two in the UK and number eight in the US It also spawned a UK number ten hit in a cover of Eddie Floyd's \"Knock on Wood\" After a break in Philadelphia, where Bowie recorded new material, the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul [87]\n\n\n1976–1979: Berlin era\nIn August 1976, Bowie moved to West Berlin with his old friend Iggy Pop to rid themselves of their respective drug addictions and escape the spotlight [107] [108] [109] Bowie's interest in German krautrock and the ambient works of multi-instrumentalist Brian Eno culminated in the first of three albums, co-produced with Visconti, that became known as the Berlin Trilogy [110] [111] The album, Low (1977), was recorded in France and took influence from krautrock and experimental music and featured both short song-fragments and ambient instrumentals [112] [113] Before its recording, Bowie produced Iggy Pop's debut solo album The Idiot, described by Pegg as \"a stepping stone between Station to Station and Low\" [114] Low was completed in November, but left unreleased for three months RCA did not see the album as commercially viable and was expecting another success following Young Americans and Station to Station [115] [116] Bowie's former manager Tony Defries, who maintained a significant financial interest in Bowie's affairs, had tried to prevent the album from being released [107] Upon its release in January 1977, Low yielded the UK number three single \"Sound and Vision\", and its own performance surpassed that of Station to Station in the UK chart, where it reached number two [117] Bowie himself did not promote it, [107] instead touring with Pop as his keyboardist throughout March and April before recording Pop's follow-up, Lust for Life [118]\n\n\n1980–1988: New Romantic and pop era\nScary Monsters (and Super Creeps) (1980) produced the number one single \"Ashes to Ashes\", featuring the textural guitar-synthesiser work of Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from \"Space Oddity\" The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club \"Blitz\"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time [138] While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Fripp and Pete Townshend [139] Topping the UK Albums Chart for the first time since Diamond Dogs, [140] Buckley writes that with Scary Monsters, Bowie achieved \"the perfect balance\" of creativity and mainstream success [141]\n\n\n1989–1991: Tin Machine\nWanting to completely rejuvenate himself following the critical failures of Tonight and Never Let Me Down, [166] Bowie placed his solo career on hold after meeting guitarist Reeves Gabrels and formed the hard rock quartet Tin Machine The line-up was completed by bassist and drummer Tony and Hunt Sales, who had played with Bowie on Iggy Pop's Lust for Life in 1977 [167] [168] Although he intended Tin Machine to operate as a democracy, Bowie dominated, both in songwriting and in decision-making [169] The band's 1989 self-titled debut album received mixed reviews and, [170] according to author Paul Trynka, was quickly dismissed as \"pompous, dogmatic and dull\" [171] EMI complained of \"lyrics that preach\" as well as \"repetitive tunes\" and \"minimalist or no production\" [172] It reached number three in the UK and was supported by a twelve-date tour [173] [174]\n\n\n1992–1998: Electronic period\nOn 20 April 1992, Bowie appeared at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, following the Queen singer's death the previous year As well as performing \"'Heroes'\" and \"All the Young Dudes\", he was joined on \"Under Pressure\" by Annie Lennox, who took Mercury's vocal part; during his appearance, Bowie knelt and recited the Lord's Prayer at Wembley Stadium [183] [184] Four days later, Bowie and Iman married in Switzerland Intending to move to Los Angeles, they flew in to search for a suitable property, but found themselves confined to their hotel, under curfew: the 1992 Los Angeles riots began the day they arrived They settled in New York instead [185]\n\n\n1999–2012: Neoclassicist era\nBowie, with Gabrels, created the soundtrack for Omikron: The Nomad Soul, a 1999 computer game in which he and Iman also voiced characters based on their likenesses Released the same year and containing re-recorded tracks from Omikron, his album Hours featured a song with lyrics by the winner of his \"Cyber Song Contest\" Internet competition, Alex Grant [204] Making extensive use of live instruments, the album was Bowie's exit from heavy electronica [205] Hours and a performance on VH1 Storytellers in mid-1999 represented the end of Gabrels' association with Bowie as a performer and songwriter [206] Sessions for Toy, a planned collection of remakes of tracks from Bowie's 1960s period, commenced in 2000, but was shelved due to EMI/Virgin's lack of faith in its commercial appeal [207] Bowie and Visconti continued their collaboration, producing a new album of completely original songs instead: the result of the sessions was the 2002 album Heathen [208]\n\n\n2013–2016: Final years\nOn 8 January 2013, his 66th birthday, his website announced a new studio album—his first in a decade—to be titled The Next Day and scheduled for release in March; [234] the announcement was accompanied by the immediate release of the single \"Where Are We Now?\" [235] A music video for the single was released onto Vimeo the same day, directed by New York artist Tony Oursler [235] The single topped the UK iTunes Chart within hours of its release, [236] and debuted in the UK Singles Chart at number six, [237] his first single to enter the Top 10 for two decades (since \"Jump They Say\" in 1993)  A second single and video, \"The Stars (Are Out Tonight)\", were released at the end of February Directed by Floria Sigismondi, it stars Bowie and Tilda Swinton as a married couple [238]\n\n\nPosthumous releases\nIn September 2016, a box set Who Can I Be Now? (1974–1976) was released covering Bowie's mid-1970s soul period; it included The Gouster, a previously unreleased 1974 album that evolved into Young Americans [266] An EP, No Plan, was released on 8 January 2017, which would have been Bowie's 70th birthday [267] Apart from \"Lazarus\", the EP includes three songs that Bowie recorded during the Blackstar sessions, but were left off the album and appeared on the soundtrack album for the Lazarus musical in October 2016 [268] A music video for the title track was also released [268] 2017 and 2018 also saw the release of a series of posthumous live albums, Cracked Actor (Live Los Angeles '74), Live Nassau Coliseum '76 and Welcome to the Blackout (Live London '78) [269] [270] [271] In the two years following his death, Bowie sold five million records in the UK alone [272] In their top 10 list for the Global Recording Artist of the Year, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry named Bowie the second-bestselling artist worldwide in 2016, behind Drake [273]\n\n\nActing career\nIn addition to music, Bowie took acting roles throughout his career, appearing in over 30 films, television shows and theatrical productions His acting career was \"productively selective\", largely eschewing starring roles for cameos and supporting parts; [282] [283] he once described his film career as \"splashing in the kids' pool\" [226] He mostly chose projects with arthouse directors that he felt were outside the Hollywood mainstream, commenting in 2000: \"One cameo for Scorsese to me brings so much more satisfaction than, say, a James Bond.\" [226] Critics have believed that, had he not chosen to pursue music, he could have found great success as an actor [284] [285] Others have felt that, while his screen presence was singular, his best contributions to film were the use of his songs in films such as Lost Highway, A Knight's Tale, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and Inglourious Basterds [286] [287]\n\n\n1960s and 1970s\nBowie's acting career predated his commercial breakthrough as a musician His first film was a short fourteen-minute black-and-white film called The Image, shot in September 1967 Concerning a ghostly boy who emerges from a troubled artist's painting to haunt him, Bowie later called the film \"awful\" [226] [288] From December 1967 to March 1968, Bowie acted in mime Lindsay Kemp's theatrical production Pierrot in Turquoise, during which he performed several songs from his self-titled debut album The production was later adapted into the 1970 television film The Looking Glass Murders [226] In late January 1968, Bowie filmed a walk-on role for the BBC drama series Theatre 625 that aired in May [289] He also appeared as a walk-on extra in the 1969 film adaptation of Leslie Thomas's 1966 comic novel The Virgin Soldiers [288]\n\n\n1980s\nFrom July 1980 to January 1981, Bowie played Joseph Merrick in the Broadway theatre production The Elephant Man, which he undertook wearing no stage make-up, earning critical praise for his performance [294] [295] Christiane F., a 1981 biographical film focusing on a young girl's drug addiction in West Berlin, featured Bowie in a cameo appearance as himself at a concert in Germany Its soundtrack album, Christiane F (1981), featured much material from his Berlin albums [296] The following year, he starred in the titular role in a BBC adaptation of the Bertolt Brecht play Baal [297]\n\n\n1990s\nIn 1991, Bowie reteamed with Landis for an episode of the HBO sitcom Dream On and played a disgruntled restaurant employee opposite Rosanna Arquette in The Linguini Incident [309] [310] Bowie portrayed the mysterious FBI agent Phillip Jeffries in David Lynch's Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992) The prequel to the television series was poorly received at the time of its release, but has since been critically reevaluated [311] He took a small but pivotal role as his friend Andy Warhol in Basquiat, artist/director Julian Schnabel's 1996 biopic of Jean-Michel Basquiat, another artist he considered a friend and colleague [226] Bowie co-starred in Giovanni Veronesi's Spaghetti Western Il Mio West (1998, released as Gunslinger's Revenge in the US in 2005) as the most feared gunfighter in the region [312] He played the ageing gangster Bernie in Andrew Goth's Everybody Loves Sunshine (1999, released in the US as B.U.S.T.E.D.), [313] and appeared as the host in the second season of the television horror anthology series The Hunger Despite having several episodes which focus on vampires and Bowie's involvement, the show had no plot connection to the 1983 film The Hunger [314] In 1999, Bowie voiced two characters in the Dreamcast game Omikron: The Nomad Soul, his only appearance in a video game [315]\n\n\n2000s and posthumous notes\nIn Mr Rice's Secret (2000), Bowie played the title role as the neighbour of a terminally ill 12-year-old boy [316] Bowie appeared as himself in the 2001 Ben Stiller comedy Zoolander, judging a \"walk-off\" between rival male models, [317] and in Eric Idle's 2002 mockumentary The Rutles 2: Can't Buy Me Lunch [318] In 2005, he filmed a commercial with Snoop Dogg for XM Satellite Radio [319] Bowie portrayed a fictionalised version of the inventor Nikola Tesla in Christopher Nolan's film The Prestige (2006), which was about the bitter rivalry between two magicians in the late 19th century Nolan later claimed that Bowie was his only preference to play Tesla, and that he personally appealed to Bowie to take the role after he initially passed [320] In the same year, he voice-acted in Luc Besson's animated film Arthur and the Invisibles as the powerful villain Maltazard, [226] and appeared as himself in an episode of the Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant television series Extras [321] In 2007, he voiced the character Lord Royal Highness in the SpongeBob's Atlantis SquarePantis television film [322] In the 2008 film August, directed by Austin Chick, he played a supporting role as Ogilvie, a \"ruthless venture capitalist.\" [323] Bowie's final film appearance was a cameo as himself in the 2009 teen comedy Bandslam [324]\n\n\nOther works\nBowie was a painter and artist He moved to Switzerland in 1976, purchasing a chalet in the hills north of Lake Geneva In the new environment, his cocaine use decreased, [327] and he devoted more time to his painting, producing a number of post-modernist pieces When on tour, he took to sketching in a notebook, and photographing scenes for later reference Visiting galleries in Geneva and

[390] he dedicated the 1987 song \"Never Let Me Down\" to her [391] Schwab maintained close guard of him and did not get along with Angie, who later blamed Schwab for the downfall of her and Bowie's marriage [390] Bowie left $2 million to Schwab in his will Upon his death, friends of Bowie, including Tony Zanetta and Robin Clark, offered tributes to Schwab [390]\n\n\nSexuality\nBowie's sexuality has been the subject of debate [392] [393] While married to Angie, [394] he famously declared himself gay in a 1972 interview with Melody Maker journalist Michael Watts, [395] which generated publicity in both America and Britain; [396] Bowie was adopted as a gay icon in both countries [397] According to Buckley, \"If Ziggy confused both his creator and his audience, a big part of that confusion centred on the topic of sexuality.\" [398] He affirmed his stance in a 1976 interview with Playboy, stating: \"It's true—I am a bisexual But I can't deny that I've used that fact very well I suppose it's the best thing that ever happened to me.\" [399] His claim of bisexuality has been supported by Angie [400]\n\n\nSpirituality and religion\nBeginning in 1967 from the influence of his half-brother, [16] Bowie became interested in Buddhism and, with commercial success eluding him, [409] he considered becoming a Buddhist monk [410] Biographer Marc Spitz states that the religion reminded the young artist that other goals in life existed outside fame and material gain and one can learn about themselves through meditation and chanting [409] After a few months' study at Tibet House in London, he was told by his Lama, Chime Rinpoche, \"You don't want to be Buddhist. .. You should follow music.\" [411] [412] By 1975, Bowie admitted, \"I felt totally, absolutely alone And I probably was alone because I pretty much had abandoned God.\" [413] In his will, Bowie stipulated that he be cremated and his ashes scattered in Bali \"in accordance with the Buddhist rituals\" [214]\n\n\nPolitical views\nIn his first ever television interview, Bowie, under the name Davie Jones, spoke out about prejudice against long-haired men after he and his then-band the Manish Boys were asked to cut their hair before a BBC television appearance He and the Manish Boys were interviewed on the network's 12 November 1964 instalment of Tonight to champion their cause, where Bowie claimed to be a spokesperson for the nonexistent Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Long-Haired Men [422] He stated on the programme, \"I think we all like long hair and we don't see why other people should persecute us because of it.\" [423]\n\n\nDeath\nBowie died of liver cancer in his New York City apartment on 10 January 2016 [438] He had been diagnosed 18 months earlier, but he had not made his condition public [248] The Belgian theatre director Ivo van Hove, who had worked with Bowie on his off-Broadway musical Lazarus, explained that while Bowie was unable to attend its rehearsals due to the progression of the disease, he had otherwise continued to work during his illness [439]\n\n\nLegacy and influence\nBowie is generally regarded as one of the most influential musicians of all time [448] [449] [450] According to Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, by 1980 he was \"the most important and influential artist since the Beatles\" [451] His influence was wide-reaching due to constant reinvention, [452] leading him to be dubbed the \"chameleon of rock\" [453] [454] The biographer Thomas Forget said in 2002: \"Because he succeeded in so many different styles of music, it is almost impossible to find a popular artist today that has not been influenced by David Bowie.\" [455] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph stated that Bowie had \"one of the supreme careers in popular music, art and culture of the 20th century\" and \"he was too inventive, too mercurial, too strange for all but his most devoted fans to keep up with\" [456]\n\n\nDavid Bowie Is\nAn exhibition of Bowie artefacts, called David Bowie Is, was organised by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, and shown there in 2013 [473] The London exhibit was visited by over 300,000 people, making it one of the most successful exhibitions ever staged at the museum [474] Later that year the exhibition began a world tour which started in Toronto and included stops lasting a few months each throughout Europe, Asia and North America before the exhibit ended in 2018 at the Brooklyn Museum [475] The exhibition hosted around 2,000,000 visitors over its run [476]\n\n\nStardust biopic\nThe biopic Stardust was announced on 31 January 2019, with musician and actor Johnny Flynn as Bowie, Jena Malone as his wife Angie, and Marc Maron as his publicist [477] Written by Christopher Bell and directed by Gabriel Range, the film follows Bowie on his first trip to the United States in 1971 Bowie's son Duncan Jones spoke out against the film, saying he was not consulted and that the film would not have permission to use Bowie's music [478] The film was set to premiere at the 2020 Tribeca Film Festival, but the festival was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic [479] Critics were generally unfavourable in their reviews [480]\n\n\nMoonage Daydream\nA film based on Bowie's musical journey throughout his career was announced on 23 May 2022 Titled Moonage Daydream, after the song \"Moonage Daydream\", the film is written and directed by Brett Morgen and features never-before-seen footage, performances and music framed by Bowie's own narration Morgan stated that \"Bowie cannot be defined, he can be experienced..

Dory\n\nStudying the dramatic arts under Lindsay Kemp, from avant-garde theatre and mime to commedia dell'arte, Bowie became immersed in the creation of personae to present to the world Satirising life in a British prison, his composition \"Over the Wall We Go\" became a 1967 single for Oscar; another Bowie song, \"Silly Boy Blue\", was released by Billy Fury the following year [38] Playing acoustic guitar, Hermione Farthingale formed a group with Bowie and guitarist John Hutchinson named Feathers; between September 1968 and early 1969 the trio gave a small number of concerts combining folk, Merseybeat, poetry and mime [39]\n\n\n1972–1974: Glam rock era\nDressed in a striking costume, his hair dyed reddish-brown, Bowie launched his Ziggy Stardust stage show with the Spiders from Mars—Ronson, Bolder, and Woodmansey—at the Toby Jug pub in Tolworth in Kingston upon Thames on 10 February 1972 [70] The show was hugely popular, catapulting him to stardom as he toured the UK over the next six months and creating, as described by David Buckley, a \"cult of Bowie\" that was \"unique—its influence lasted longer and has been more creative than perhaps almost any other force within pop fandom.\" [70] The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), combining the hard rock elements of The Man Who Sold the World with the lighter experimental rock and pop of Hunky Dory, was released in June and was considered one of the defining albums of glam rock \"Starman\", issued as an April single ahead of the album, was to cement Bowie's UK breakthrough: both single and album charted rapidly following his July Top of the Pops performance of the song The album, which remained in the chart for two years, was soon joined there by the six-month-old Hunky Dory At the same time, the non-album single \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" and \"All the Young Dudes\", a song he wrote and produced for Mott the Hoople, [71] were successful in the UK The Ziggy Stardust Tour continued to the United States [72]\n\n\n1974–1976: \"Plastic soul\" and the Thin White Duke\nBowie moved to the US in 1974, initially staying in New York City before settling in Los Angeles [83] Diamond Dogs (1974), parts of which found him heading towards soul and funk, was the product of two distinct ideas: a musical based on a wild future in a post-apocalyptic city, and setting George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four to music [84] The album went to number one in the UK, spawning the hits \"Rebel Rebel\" and \"Diamond Dogs\", and number five in the US The supporting Diamond Dogs Tour visited cities in North America between June and December 1974 Choreographed by Toni Basil, and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects, the high-budget stage production was filmed by Alan Yentob The resulting documentary, Cracked Actor, featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided with his slide from heavy cocaine use into addiction, producing severe physical debilitation, paranoia and emotional problems [85] He later commented that the accompanying live album, David Live, ought to have been titled \"David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only in Theory\" [86] David Live nevertheless solidified Bowie's status as a superstar, charting at number two in the UK and number eight in the US It also spawned a UK number ten hit in a cover of Eddie Floyd's \"Knock on Wood\" After a break in Philadelphia, where Bowie recorded new material, the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul [87]\n\n\n1976–1979: Berlin era\nIn August 1976, Bowie moved to West Berlin with his old friend Iggy Pop to rid themselves of their respective drug addictions and escape the spotlight [107] [108] [109] Bowie's interest in German krautrock and the ambient works of multi-instrumentalist Brian Eno culminated in the first of three albums, co-produced with Visconti, that became known as the Berlin Trilogy [110] [111] The album, Low (1977), was recorded in France and took influence from krautrock and experimental music and featured both short song-fragments and ambient instrumentals [112] [113] Before its recording, Bowie produced Iggy Pop's debut solo album The Idiot, described by Pegg as \"a stepping stone between Station to Station and Low\" [114] Low was completed in November, but left unreleased for three months RCA did not see the album as commercially viable and was expecting another success following Young Americans and Station to Station [115] [116] Bowie's former manager Tony Defries, who maintained a significant financial interest in Bowie's affairs, had tried to prevent the album from being released [107] Upon its release in January 1977, Low yielded the UK number three single \"Sound and Vision\", and its own performance surpassed that of Station to Station in the UK chart, where it reached number two [117] Bowie himself did not promote it, [107] instead touring with Pop as his keyboardist throughout March and April before recording Pop's follow-up, Lust for Life [118]\n\n\n1980–1988: New Romantic and pop era\nScary Monsters (and Super Creeps) (1980) produced the number one single \"Ashes to Ashes\", featuring the textural guitar-synthesiser work of Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from \"Space Oddity\" The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club \"Blitz\"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time [138] While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Fripp and Pete Townshend [139] Topping the UK Albums Chart for the first time since Diamond Dogs, [140] Buckley writes that with Scary Monsters, Bowie achieved \"the perfect balance\" of creativity and mainstream success [141]\n\n\n1989–1991: Tin Machine\nWanting to completely rejuvenate himself following the critical failures of Tonight and Never Let Me Down, [166] Bowie placed his solo career on hold after meeting guitarist Reeves Gabrels and formed the hard rock quartet Tin Machine The line-up was completed by bassist and drummer Tony and Hunt Sales, who had played with Bowie on Iggy Pop's Lust for Life in 1977 [167] [168] Although he intended Tin Machine to operate as a democracy, Bowie dominated, both in songwriting and in decision-making [169] The band's 1989 self-titled debut album received mixed reviews and, [170] according to author Paul Trynka, was quickly dismissed as \"pompous, dogmatic and dull\" [171] EMI complained of \"lyrics that preach\" as well as \"repetitive tunes\" and \"minimalist or no production\" [172] It reached number three in the UK and was supported by a twelve-date tour [173] [174]\n\n\n1992–1998: Electronic period\nOn 20 April 1992, Bowie appeared at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, following the Queen singer's death the previous year As well as performing \"'Heroes'\" and \"All the Young Dudes\", he was joined on \"Under Pressure\" by Annie Lennox, who took Mercury's vocal part; during his appearance, Bowie knelt and recited the Lord's Prayer at Wembley Stadium [183] [184] Four days later, Bowie and Iman married in Switzerland Intending to move to Los Angeles, they flew in to search for a suitable property, but found themselves confined to their hotel, under curfew: the 1992 Los Angeles riots began the day they arrived They settled in New York instead [185]\n\n\n1999–2012: Neoclassicist era\nBowie, with Gabrels, created the soundtrack for Omikron: The Nomad Soul, a 1999 computer game in which he and Iman also voiced characters based on their likenesses Released the same year and containing re-recorded tracks from Omikron, his album Hours featured a song with lyrics by the winner of his \"Cyber Song Contest\" Internet competition, Alex Grant [204] Making extensive use of live instruments, the album was Bowie's exit from heavy electronica [205] Hours and a performance on VH1 Storytellers in mid-1999 represented the end of Gabrels' association with Bowie as a performer and songwriter [206] Sessions for Toy, a planned collection of remakes of tracks from Bowie's 1960s period, commenced in 2000, but was shelved due to EMI/Virgin's lack of faith in its commercial appeal [207] Bowie and Visconti continued their collaboration, producing a new album of completely original songs instead: the result of the sessions was the 2002 album Heathen [208]\n\n\n2013–2016: Final years\nOn 8 January 2013, his 66th birthday, his website announced a new studio album—his first in a decade—to be titled The Next Day and scheduled for release in March; [234] the announcement was accompanied by the immediate release of the single \"Where Are We Now?\" [235] A music video for the single was released onto Vimeo the same day, directed by New York artist Tony Oursler [235] The single topped the UK iTunes Chart within hours of its release, [236] and debuted in the UK Singles Chart at number six, [237] his first single to enter the Top 10 for two decades (since \"Jump They Say\" in 1993)  A second single and video, \"The Stars (Are Out Tonight)\", were released at the end of February Directed by Floria Sigismondi, it stars Bowie and Tilda Swinton as a married couple [238]\n\n\nPosthumous releases\nIn September

8 January 2017, which would have been Bowie's 70th birthday [267] Apart from \"Lazarus\", the EP includes three songs that Bowie recorded during the Blackstar sessions, but were left off the album and

million records in the UK alone [272] In their top 10 list for the Global Recording Artist of the Year, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry named Bowie the second-bestselling artist worldwide in 2016, behind Drake [273]\n\n\nActing career\nIn addition to music, Bowie took acting roles throughout his career, appearing in over 30 films, television shows and theatrical productions His acting career was \"productively selective\", largely eschewing starring roles for cameos and supporting parts; [282] [283] he once described his film career as \"splashing in the kids' pool\" [226] He mostly chose projects with arthouse directors that he felt were outside the Hollywood mainstream, commenting in 2000: \"One cameo for Scorsese to me brings so much more satisfaction than, say, a James Bond.\" [226] Critics have believed that, had he not chosen to pursue music, he could have found great success as an actor [284] [285] Others have felt that, while his screen presence was singular, his best contributions to film were the use of his songs in films such as Lost Highway, A Knight's Tale, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and Inglourious Basterds [286] [287]\n\n\n1960s and 1970s\nBowie's acting career predated his commercial breakthrough as a musician His first film was a short fourteen-minute black-and-white film called The Image, shot in September 1967 Concerning a ghostly boy who emerges from a troubled artist's painting to haunt him, Bowie later called the film \"awful\" [226] [288] From December 1967 to March 1968, Bowie acted in mime

employee opposite Rosanna Arquette in The Linguini Incident [309] [310] Bowie portrayed the mysterious FBI agent Phillip Jeffries in David Lynch's Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992) The prequel to the television series was poorly received at the time of its release, but has since been critically reevaluated [311] He took a small but pivotal role as his friend Andy Warhol in Basquiat, artist/director Julian Schnabel's 1996 biopic of Jean-Michel Basquiat, another artist he considered a friend and colleague [226] Bowie co-starred in Giovanni Veronesi's Spaghetti Western Il Mio West

released in the US as B.U.S.T.E.D.), [313] and appeared as the host in the second season of the television horror anthology series The Hunger Despite having several episodes which focus on vampires and Bowie's involvement, the show had no plot connection to the 1983 film The Hunger [314] In 1999, Bowie voiced two characters in the Dreamcast game Omikron: The Nomad Soul, his only appearance in a video game [315]\n\n\n2000s and posthumous notes\nIn Mr Rice's Secret (2000), Bowie played the title role as the neighbour of a terminally ill 12-year-old boy [316] Bowie appeared as himself in the

with Snoop Dogg for XM Satellite Radio [319] Bowie portrayed a fictionalised version of the inventor Nikola Tesla in Christopher Nolan's film The Prestige (2006), which was about the bitter rivalry between two magicians in the late 19th century Nolan later claimed that Bowie was his only preference to play Tesla, and that he personally appealed to Bowie to take the role after he initially passed [320] In the same year, he voice-acted in Luc Besson's animated film Arthur and the Invisibles as the powerful villain Maltazard, [226] and appeared as himself in an episode of the Ricky Gervais and

[362] David received custody of Duncan After the gag order that was part of their divorce agreement ended, Angie wrote a memoir of their turbulent marriage, titled Backstage Passes: Life on the Wild Side with David Bowie [363]\n\n\nFamily\nBowie married his first wife, Mary Angela Barnett, on 19 March 1970 at Bromley Register Office in Bromley, London [360] Their son Duncan, born on 30 May 1971, was at first known as Zowie [361] Angie later described her and David's union as a marriage of convenience \"We got married so that I could  [get a permit to] work I didn't think it would last and David said, before we got married, 'I'm not really in love with you' and I thought that's probably a good thing,\" she said Bowie said about Angie that \"living with her is like living with a blow torch\" [360] The couple divorced on 8 February 1980;

[390] he dedicated the 1987 song \"Never Let Me Down\" to her [391] Schwab maintained close guard of him and did not get along with Angie, who later blamed Schwab for the downfall of her and Bowie's marriage [390] Bowie left $2 million to Schwab in his will Upon his death, friends of Bowie, including Tony Zanetta and Robin Clark, offered tributes to Schwab [390]\n\n\nSexuality\nBowie's sexuality has been the subject of debate [392] [393] While married to Angie, [394] he famously declared himself gay in a 1972 interview with Melody Maker journalist Michael Watts, [395] which generated publicity in both America and Britain; [396] Bowie was adopted as a gay icon in both countries [397] According to Buckley, \"If Ziggy confused both his creator and his audience, a big part of that confusion centred on the topic of sexuality.\" [398] He affirmed his stance in a 1976 interview with Playboy, stating: \"It's true—I am a bisexual But I can't deny that I've used that fact very well I suppose it's the best thing that ever happened to me.\" [399] His claim of bisexuality has been supported by Angie [400]\n\n\nSpirituality and religion\nBeginning in 1967 from the influence of his half-brother, [16] Bowie became interested in Buddhism and, with commercial success eluding him, [409] he considered becoming a Buddhist monk [410] Biographer Marc Spitz states that the religion reminded the young artist that other goals in life existed outside fame and material gain and one can learn about themselves through meditation and chanting [409] After a few months' study at Tibet House in London, he was told by his Lama, Chime Rinpoche, \"You don't want to be Buddhist. .. You should follow music.\" [411] [412] By 1975, Bowie admitted, \"I felt totally, absolutely alone And I probably was alone because I pretty much had abandoned God.\" [413] In his will, Bowie stipulated that he be cremated and his ashes scattered in Bali \"in accordance with the Buddhist rituals\" [214]\n\n\nPolitical views\nIn his first ever television interview, Bowie, under the name Davie Jones, spoke out about prejudice against long-haired men after he and his then-band the Manish Boys were asked to cut their hair before a BBC television appearance He and the Manish Boys were interviewed on the network's 12 November 1964 instalment of Tonight to champion their cause, where Bowie claimed to be a spokesperson for the nonexistent Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Long-Haired Men [422] He stated on the programme, \"I think we all like long hair and we don't see why other people should persecute us because of it.\" [423]\n\n\nDeath\nBowie died of liver cancer in his New York City apartment on 10 January 2016 [438] He had been diagnosed 18 months earlier, but he had not made his condition public [248] The Belgian theatre director Ivo van Hove, who had worked with Bowie on his off-Broadway musical Lazarus, explained that while Bowie was unable to attend its rehearsals due to the progression of the disease, he had otherwise continued to work during his illness [439]\n\n\nLegacy and influence\nBowie is generally regarded as one of the most influential musicians of all time [448] [449] [450] According to Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, by 1980 he was \"the most important and influential artist since the Beatles\" [451] His influence was wide-reaching due to constant reinvention, [452] leading him to be dubbed the \"chameleon of rock\" [453] [454] The biographer Thomas Forget said in 2002: \"Because he succeeded in so many different styles of music, it is almost impossible to find a popular artist today that has not been influenced by David Bowie.\" [455] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph stated that Bowie had \"one of the supreme careers in popular music, art and culture of the 20th century\" and \"he was too inventive, too mercurial, too strange for all but his most devoted fans to keep up with\" [456]\n\n\nDavid Bowie Is\nAn exhibition of Bowie artefacts, called David Bowie Is, was organised by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, and shown there in 2013 [473] The London exhibit was visited by over 300,000 people, making it one of the most successful exhibitions ever staged at the museum [474] Later that year the exhibition began a world tour which started in Toronto and included stops lasting a few months each throughout Europe, Asia and North America before the exhibit ended in 2018 at the Brooklyn Museum [475] The exhibition hosted around 2,000,000 visitors over its run [476]\n\n\nStardust biopic\nThe biopic Stardust was announced on 31 January 2019, with musician and actor Johnny Flynn as Bowie, Jena Malone as his wife Angie, and Marc Maron as his publicist [477] Written by Christopher Bell and directed by Gabriel Range, the film follows Bowie on his first trip to the United States in 1971 Bowie's son Duncan Jones spoke out against the film, saying he was not consulted and that the film would not have permission to use Bowie's music [478] The film was set to premiere at the 2020 Tribeca Film Festival, but the festival was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic [479] Critics were generally unfavourable in their reviews [480]\n\n\nMoonage Daydream\nA film based on Bowie's musical journey throughout his career was announced on 23 May 2022 Titled Moonage Daydream, after the song \"Moonage Daydream\", the film is written and directed by Brett Morgen and features never-before-seen footage, performances and music framed by Bowie's own narration Morgan stated that \"Bowie cannot be defined, he can be experienced..

Carrillo's life and career were marked by violence, corruption, and excess, and his death in 1997 was a significant blow to the Mexican government's efforts to combat organized crime.\n\n## Early Life\n\nAmado Carrillo Fuentes was born on December 17, 1956, in Guamuchilito, Navolato, Sinaloa, Mexico, to Walter Vicente Carrillo Vega and Aurora Fuentes. He was the eldest of 12 children, and his family was considered to be of modest means. Carrillo's early life was marked by poverty and hardship, and he grew up in a small village surrounded by fields and livestock.\n\n## Career\n\nCarrillo's entry into the world of organized crime began at a young age. He was initially part of the Guadalajara Cartel, one of the earliest and most influential cartels in Mexico. Under the leadership of Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, also known as \"Don Neto,\" Carrillo was sent to Ojinaga, Chihuahua, to oversee the cocaine shipments and learn about border operations. He worked closely with Pablo Acosta Villarreal, also known as \"El Zorro de Ojinaga\" or \"The Ojinaga Fox,\" and Rafael Aguilar Guajardo, two of the most notorious figures in the Mexican underworld.\n\nCarrillo's rise to power was rapid and remarkable. He quickly gained a reputation as a ruthless and cunning operator, and his organization expanded its reach and influence across Mexico and beyond. He formed alliances with other powerful cartels, including the Cali Cartel in Colombia and the Arellano Félix family in Tijuana. He also worked closely with Joaquín Guzmán Loera, also known as \"El Chapo,\" one of the most infamous drug lords in Mexico.\n\nCarrillo's organization was responsible for a significant portion of the cocaine and heroin smuggled into the United States during the 1990s. His network of smugglers and distributors stretched from the Mexican border to major cities across the United States, including Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York.\n\n## Death\n\nThe pressure to capture Carrillo intensified among U.S. and Mexican authorities after people in Morelos state began silent marches against Governor Jorge Carrillo Olea and his presumed complacency with drug-related violence. Carrillo Fuentes owned a house three blocks from the governor's official residence and regularly held narco-fiestas in the municipality of Tetecala.\n\nIn an effort to evade capture, Carrillo underwent facial plastic surgery and abdominal surgery liposuction on July 4, 1997, at Santa Mónica Hospital in Mexico City.

In mid-2018, talks of an announcement intensified, with news sources claiming that an agreement had been reached for the competition to be launched, with the 48-team Europa League group stage being split into two, with the lower half forming the nucleus of what would be the new event.\n\n**Trophy**\n\nThe Conference League trophy was designed by Pentagram, a design consultancy agency. The trophy is made from brass, with galvanic steel and silver plating. It features 32 hexagonal columns, representing the 32 teams in the original group stage, curving upwards in a manner intended to resemble a football curling through the air towards the goal.\n\n**Format**\n\nSimilar to the UEFA Champions League, qualification to the Conference League is split into two paths – separating champions and non-champions – and contains three rounds plus a play-off.

The top eight teams from the league phase receive a bye to the round of 16, while the teams ranked 9th to 24th contest the knockout play-offs with the winners advancing to the round of 16.

Open, during a match against Alexander Zverev, Tsitsipas landed in a controversy for taking an extended toilet break after Zverev complained to the umpire about the situation In the US Open, the controversy became worse, after Tsitsipas took a toilet break twice, when he was losing his first round match against Andy Murray, and even asked to stop the match while down in one of the games Murray complained after the second toilet break, claiming that Tsitsipas's breaks are too long and change the momentum of the game He claimed to have \"lost all respect\" for Tsitsipas, and later, after losing the match, wrote on Twitter, claiming that it takes Tsitsipas twice as long to go to the toilet as it takes Jeff Bezos to fly into space [107] [108]\n\n\n2022: 200th match win, first title on grass\nAt the 2022 Australian Open, Tsitsipas reached the semifinals for the third time, where he faced Daniil Medvedev in a rematch of the previous year's semifinal He lost in four sets, and

aggressive baseliner capable of an all-court player style as well, very similar to Roger Federer He aims to hit powerful groundstroke winners and has a particularly strong forehand using an Eastern grip [140] His forehand is particularly useful in finishing points off of the first serve, as combined with his big serve He uses his high topspin rate to push opponents off the court for winners, or go to the net more often than the typical baseliner [141] One of his weaknesses is to overhit and make unforced errors while trying to hit winners [142] [143] He also struggles returning serve against

a Greek professional tennis player who was born on August 12, 1998, in Athens, Greece. He is the son of Apostolos Tsitsipas and Julia Apostoli (née Salnikova), and his father is a Greek and was born in Proastio, Karditsa, while his mother is Russian. Tsitsipas's maternal grandfather, Sergei Salnikov, was a Soviet footballer who played for Zenit Leningrad, Spartak Moscow, and Dynamo Moscow. Tsitsipas's parents are experienced tennis players, and his mother, in particular, was a world No 1 junior who had a career-high professional ranking inside the top 200 and represented the Soviet Union in the Federation Cup.\n\nEarly Life and Background\nTsitsipas was born in Athens, Greece, to Apostolos Tsitsipas and Julia Apostoli (née Salnikova). His father is a Greek, and his mother is Russian. Tsitsipas's maternal grandfather, Sergei Salnikov, was a Soviet footballer who played for Zenit Leningrad, Spartak Moscow, and Dynamo Moscow. Tsitsipas's parents are experienced tennis players, and his mother, in particular, was a world No 1 junior who had a career-high professional ranking inside the top 200 and represented the Soviet Union in the Federation Cup. His parents had been working as tennis instructors at the Astir Palace resort hotel in Vouliagmeni at the time of his birth.\n\nTsitsipas has three younger siblings: two brothers, Petros and Pavlos, and a sister, Elisavet, who is the youngest. All of his siblings are also tennis players.\n\nJunior Career\nTsitsipas began playing on the ITF Junior Circuit in 2013 at the age of 14. He did not play in any high-level Grade A tournaments until the Abierto Juvenil Mexicano in November 2014, but was able to make it all the way to the final of his second career Grade A event at the Orange Bowl a month later. Tsitsipas had entered the tournament ranked outside of the top 100 in the junior rankings. In 2015, Tsitsipas got his first opportunity to play in the junior Grand Slam tournaments. In these four events, a quarterfinal at the Australian Open was his best result. He did not win any singles finals that year, but he did have another runner-up finish at the Orange Bowl, this time losing to Miomir Kecmanović in a third set tiebreak. He finished the season as the No 14 ranked junior in the world.\n\nProfessional Career\nTsitsipas began playing low-level ITF Futures events in Greece in 2013 shortly after turning 15, not long after he started competing on the junior tour. He qualified for his first event on the ATP Challenger Tour at the Burnie International in early 2015 while still 16 years old, but lost his only main draw match to Benjamin Mitchell. Tsitsipas won his first Futures title later that year and would go on to win a total of eleven such titles, five in singles and six in doubles, through the end of 2016. He also won his first Challenger match near the end of 2015 in Mohammedia in Morocco. Tsitsipas returned to Morocco a year later and reached his first two Challenger finals in back-to-back weeks at Mohammedia and Casablanca. This success in Africa helped him crack the top 200 later that October. Towards the end of that month, Tsitsipas was granted a qualifying wild card into the Swiss Indoors in Basel, his first ATP Tour appearance. He defeated Rajeev Ram in the opening round, but was unable to qualify after a loss to Robin Haase.\n\n2013–17: Top 100, ATP Semifinal, Top 10 Victory\nTsitsipas began playing low-level ITF Futures events in Greece in 2013 shortly after turning 15, not long after he started competing on the junior tour.

After losing in the opening round in his Australian Open debut, his best result in the rest of the early-year hard court season was another quarterfinal at the Dubai Tennis Championships. Tsitsipas's first breakthrough of the year came at the Barcelona Open during the clay court season, where he reached his first career ATP final without dropping a set. During the ATP 500 Series tournament, he defeated three top 20 players including No 7 Thiem, before losing to world No 1 Rafael Nadal in a lopsided match. With this result, Tsitsipas moved into the top 50 and became the second Greek to reach an ATP final after Nicky Kalogeropoulos in 1973. His performance also gained national attention in Greece, where tennis is not a widely popular sport.\n\n2019: ATP Finals Champion, World No. 5\nTsitsipas began the season at the Hopman Cup alongside Maria Sakkari, making them the first team to represent Greece at the event in 17 years.

They were ranked second on the tiebreak criteria and did not advance out of the group. Tsitsipas's only singles win was against Frances Tiafoe, while one of his losses was against Roger Federer. At the 2019 Australian Open, Tsitsipas reached his first major semifinal, despite having won just five Grand Slam singles matches in total the previous year. All five of his wins at the event came in four sets. He upset world No 3 and defending champion Roger Federer in the fourth round, saving all twelve of the break points he faced in a rematch of their Hopman Cup encounter earlier in the month. After continuing his run against Roberto Bautista Agut, he easily lost to No 2 Rafael Nadal, winning only six games. Nonetheless, his performance helped him climb to a career-best ranking of No 12 in the world to become the highest-ranked Greek player in history.\n\n2020: French Open Semifinal\nHe entered the 2020 Australian Open seeded 6th in the men's bracket, but failed to repeat his success of 2019, losing in the 3rd round to Milos Raonic.

He recovered quickly to defend his title at the Open 13 tournament, winning his 5th ATP title, recording in the process 4 wins in a row without dropping a set, and defeating Félix Auger-Aliassime in the final. The following week he entered the Dubai Tennis Championships as the second seed behind Novak Djokovic.

Medvedev won his first five matches against Tsitsipas, but Tsitsipas has won four of their next eight.\n\nPersonal Life\nTsitsipas studied at an English-language school in his youth.

similar to Roger Federer He aims to hit powerful groundstroke winners and has a particularly strong forehand using an Eastern grip [140] His forehand is particularly useful in finishing points off of the first serve, as combined with his big serve He uses his high topspin rate to push opponents off the court for winners, or go to the net more often than the typical baseliner [141] One of his weaknesses is to overhit and make unforced errors while trying to hit winners [142] [143] He also struggles returning serve against players with strong kick serves on the backhand side, a weakness he has worked to improve through usage of blocked and slice returns on his backhand [144]\n\n\nRivalries\nStefanos Tsitsipas and Daniil Medvedev have faced each other 13 times since 2018, with Medvedev

which Zverev prevailed 6–4, 3–6, 7–6(7–4) [152] [153] [154] Tsitsipas won their only Grand Slam match so far, in the 2021 French Open semifinals, winning in a five-set match with a scoreline of 6–3, 6–3, 4–6, 4–6, 6–3 [155] [156]\n\n\nPersonal life\nTsitsipas studied at an English-language school in his youth He can speak English, Greek, and Russian [16] He is a supporter of Greek football club AEK Athens [157] Tsitsipas's hobbies include vlogging He hosts his own YouTube channel where he posts videos of his travels [158] He had been in a relationship with fellow tennis player Paula

Born Ethel Margaret Whigham, she was the only child of a wealthy American family and was educated in New York City before marrying into the British nobility.\n\n**Early Years**\n\nEthel Margaret Whigham was born on November 10, 1912, in New York City. Her father, George Hay Whigham, was a self-made millionaire and chairman of the Celanese Corporation of Britain and North America. Her mother, Helen Mann Hannay, was a member of a prominent American family. Margaret spent the first fourteen years of her life in New York City, where she was educated privately at the Hewitt School.\n\nMargaret's beauty was much spoken of, and she had youthful romances with several high-society men, including Prince Aly Khan, millionaire aviator Glen Kidston, and publishing heir Max Aitken, later the second Lord Beaverbrook. Her family's wealth and connections afforded her a privileged upbringing, and she was well-prepared for a life of luxury and refinement.\n\n**First Marriage**\n\nOn February 21, 1933, Margaret married Sweeny at the Brompton Oratory in London. Her Norman Hartnell wedding dress was a highly publicized affair, and the traffic in Knightsbridge was blocked for three hours due to the commotion. Margaret's marriage was a society event of the year, and she was hailed as a style icon and a symbol of elegance.\n\nFor the rest of her life, Margaret was associated with glamour and sophistication, being a firm client of Hartnell, Victor Stiebel, and Angele Delanghe in London before and after the Second World War. She was one of a series of society beauties photographed as classical figures by Madame Yevonde.\n\n**Intermarital Relationships**\n\nThe Sweenys divorced in 1947 after a tumultuous marriage. Margaret went on to have a series of romantic relationships with high-society men, including a brief engagement to a Texas-born banker, Joseph Thomas of Lehman Brothers, and a serious romance with Theodore Rousseau, curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nMargaret recalled Rousseau as \"highly intelligent, witty, and self-confident to the point of arrogance.\" However, the romance ended without the couple formalizing their liaison, as Rousseau's mother feared that he was not \"stepfather material.\" Despite this, Margaret observed that she and Rousseau continued to see each other constantly.\n\n**Second Marriage**\n\nOn March 22, 1951, Margaret became the third wife of Ian Douglas Campbell, 11th Duke of Argyll. The marriage was a high-society event, and Margaret wrote later in life that she had been drawn to the Duke's title and wealth.\n\nHowever, the marriage was short-lived, and the Duke's addiction to alcohol, gambling, and prescription drugs soon became a problem. Margaret's first two wives had also reported physical and emotional abuse at the hands of the Duke, and Margaret soon found herself in a similar situation.\n\n**Divorce from the Duke of Argyll**\n\nThe marriage was falling apart within a few years, and Margaret took action to end it. The Duke accused her of infidelity and included a set of Polaroid photographs of the Duchess naked, save for her signature three-strand pearl necklace, in the company of another man in the 1963 divorce case.\n\nThe photographs also showed the Duchess fellating a naked man whose face was not shown. It was speculated that this \"headless man\" was the Minister of Defence Duncan Sandys, who offered to resign from the cabinet.\n\n**Final Years**\n\nMargaret wrote a memoir, Forget Not, published by W H Allen Ltd in 1975, which was reviewed negatively for its name-dropping and air of entitlement. She also lent her name as author to a guide to entertaining.\n\nWith her fortune diminished, she opened her London house at 48 Upper Grosvenor Street, which had been decorated for her parents in 1935 by Syrie Maugham, for paid tours. Her extravagant lifestyle and ill-considered investments left her largely penniless by the time she died.\n\n**Personality**\n\nMargaret once told The New York Times, \"I don't think anybody has real style or class any more. Everyone's got old and fat.\" She described herself as \"always vain.\" Another quote gives an insight into her personality: \"Always a poodle, only a poodle! That, and three strands of pearls!\" she said. \"Together they are absolutely the essential things in life.\"\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nMargaret's life and marriage have been the subject of several books, articles, and documentaries. Her high-society connections and glamorous lifestyle have made her a fascinating figure in popular culture.\n\nIn conclusion, Margaret Campbell, Duchess of Argyll, was a complex and fascinating figure who lived a life of luxury and refinement.

[10] In formulating a new politics, they drew on their work with a variety of Black Power organizations [40] Newton and Seale first met in 1962 when they were both students at Merritt College [41] They joined Donald Warden's Afro-American Association, where they read widely, debated, and organized in an emergent black nationalist tradition inspired by Malcolm X and others [42] Eventually dissatisfied with Warden's accommodationism, they developed a revolutionary anti-imperialist perspective working with more active and militant groups like the Soul Students Advisory Council and the Revolutionary Action Movement [43] [44] Their paid jobs running youth service programs at the North Oakland Neighborhood Anti-Poverty Center allowed them to develop a revolutionary nationalist approach to community service, later a key element in the Black Panther Party's \"community survival programs.\" [45]\n\n\nLate 1966 to early 1967\nThe initial tactic of the party used contemporary open-carry gun laws to protect Party members when policing the police This act was done to record incidents of police brutality by distantly following police cars around neighborhoods [54] When confronted by a police officer, Party members cited laws proving they had done nothing wrong and threatened to take to court any officer that violated their constitutional rights [55] Between the end of 1966 to the start of 1967, the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense's armed police patrols in Oakland black communities attracted a small handful of members [56] Numbers grew slightly starting in

speaker for a conference held in his honor [57]\n\n\nRallies in Richmond, California\nThe black community of Richmond, California wanted protection against police brutality [61] With only three main streets for entering and exiting the neighborhood, it was easy for police to control, contain, and suppress the population [62] On April 1, 1967, a black unarmed twenty-two-year-old construction worker named Denzil Dowell was shot dead by police in North Richmond [63] Dowell's family contacted the Black Panther Party for assistance after county officials refused to investigate the case [64] The Party held rallies in North Richmond that educated the community on armed self-defense and the Denzil Dowell incident [65] Police seldom interfered at these rallies because every Panther was armed and no laws were broken [66] The Party's ideals resonated with several community members, who then brought their own guns to the next rallies [67]\n\n\nProtest at the Statehouse\nAwareness of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense grew rapidly after their May 2, 1967, protest at the California State Capitol On May 2, 1967, the California State Assembly Committee on Criminal Procedure was scheduled to convene to discuss what was known as the \"Mulford Act,\" which would make the public carrying of loaded firearms illegal Newton, with Minister of Information Eldridge Cleaver, put together a plan to send a group of 26 armed Panthers led by Seale from Oakland to Sacramento to protest the bill The group entered the assembly carrying their weapons, an incident which was widely publicized, and which prompted police to arrest Seale and five others The group pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of disrupting a legislative session [68] At the time of the protest, the Party had fewer than 100 members in total [69]\n\n\nTen-point program\nThe Black Panther Party first publicized its original \"What We Want Now!\" Ten-Point program on May 15, 1967, following the Sacramento action, in the second issue of The Black Panther newspaper [57]\n\n\nLate 1967 to early 1968\nIn August 1967, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) instructed its program \"COINTELPRO\" to

of the country\" [71] By 1969, the Black Panthers and their allies had become primary COINTELPRO targets, singled out in 233 of the 295 authorized \"Black Nationalist\" COINTELPRO actions [72] The goals of the program were to prevent the unification of militant black nationalist groups and to weaken their leadership, as well as to discredit them to reduce their support and growth The initial targets included the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, the Revolutionary Action Movement and the Nation of Islam, as well as leaders including the Rev Martin Luther King Jr., Stokely Carmichael, H Rap Brown, Maxwell Stanford and Elijah Muhammad As assistant FBI Director William Sullivan later testified in front of the Church Committee, the

altercation with Huey P Newton during a traffic stop in which Newton and backup officer Herbert Heanes also sustained gunshot wounds Newton was convicted of voluntary manslaughter at trial, but the conviction was later overturned In his book Shadow of the Panther, writer Hugh Pearson alleges that Newton was intoxicated in the hours before the incident, and claimed to have willfully killed John Frey [78]\n\n\nFree Huey! campaign\nAt the time, Newton claimed that he had been falsely accused, leading to the Party's \"Free Huey!\" campaign The police killing gained the party even wider recognition by the radical American left [79] and it stimulated the growth of the Party nationwide [69] Newton was released after three years, when his conviction was reversed on appeal [80]\n\n\nFounding of the L. A. Chapter\nIn 1968 the southern California chapter was founded by Alprentice \"Bunchy\" Carter in Los Angeles Carter was the leader of the Slauson Street gang, and many of the L.A chapter's early recruits were Slausons [85]\n\n\nKilling of Bobby Hutton\nBobby James Hutton was born April 21, 1950, in Jefferson County, Arkansas At the age of three, he and his family moved to Oakland, California after being harassed by racist vigilante groups associated with the Ku Klux Klan In December 1966, he became the first treasurer and recruit of the Black Panther Party at the age of just 16 years old.\n\n\nLate 1968\nIn 1968, the group shortened its name to the Black Panther Party and sought to focus directly on political action Members were encouraged to carry guns and to defend themselves against violence An influx of college students joined the group, which had consisted chiefly of \"brothers off the block\" This created some tension in the group Some members were more interested in supporting the Panthers' social programs, while others wanted to maintain their \"street mentality\" [97]\n\n\nChronology\nIn 1970, a group of Panthers including Eldridge Cleaver and Elaine Brown

Panthers died.\n\n\nBlack Panther Party Education Programs and Liberation Schools\nParamount to their beliefs regarding the need for individual agency to catalyze community change, the Black Panther Party (BPP) strongly supported the education of the masses As part of their Ten-Point Program which set forth the ideals and goals of the party, they demanded an equitable education for all black people Study and reading was important for all would-be candidates of the Party, which included studying the Ten-Point Program, reading the Black Panther newspaper, and attending a series of political education classes as well as weapons training A 1968 \"Panther Party Book List\" was circulated in the party newspaper, recommending Panthers read the following titles (listed in order): [112]\n\n\nIntercommunal Youth Institute\nThe first Liberation School was opened by the Richmond Black Panthers in July 1969 with brunch served and snacks provided to students Another school was opened in Mt Vernon New York on July 17 of the subsequent year [113] These schools were informal in nature and more closely resembled after-school or summer programs [114] While these campuses were the first to open, the first full-time and longest-running Liberation School was opened in January 1971 in Oakland in response to the inequitable conditions in the Oakland Unified School District which was ranked one of the lowest-scoring districts in California [115] Named the Intercommunal Youth Institute (IYI), this school, under the directorship of Brenda Bay, and later Ericka Huggins, enrolled twenty-eight students in its first year, with the majority being the children of Black Panther parents This number grew to fifty by the 1973–1974 school year To provide full support for Black Panther parents whose time was spent organizing, some of the students and faculty members lived together year around The school itself was dissimilar to traditional schools in a variety of ways including the fact that students were separated by academic performance rather than age, and students were often provided one-on-one support as the faculty to student ratio was 1:10 [115]\n\n\nOakland Community School\nIn 1974, due to increased interest in enrolling in the school, school officials decided to move to a larger facility and subsequently changed the school's name to Oakland Community School During this year, the school graduated its first class [116] Although the student population continued to grow ranging between 50 and 150 between 1974 and 1977, the original core values of individualized instruction remained [115] In September 1977, the school received a special award from Governor Edmund Brown Jr and the California Legislature for \"having set the standard for the highest level of elementary education in the state [116]\n\n\nKilling of Fred Hampton and Mark Clark\nIn Chicago, on December 4, 1969, two Panthers were killed when the Chicago Police raided the home of Panther leader Fred Hampton The raid had been orchestrated by the police in conjunction with the FBI Hampton was shot and killed, as was Panther guard Mark Clark A federal investigation reported that only one shot was fired by the Panthers, and police fired at least 80 shots [118] The only shot fired by the Panthers was from Mark Clark, who appeared to fire a single round determined to be the result of a reflexive death convulsion after he was immediately struck in the chest by shots from the police at the start of the raid.\n\n\nTorture-murder of Alex Rackley\nIn May 1969, three members of the New Haven chapter tortured and murdered Alex Rackley, a 19-year-old member of the New York chapter, because they suspected him of being a police informant Three party officers—Warren Kimbro, George Sams, Jr., and Lonnie McLucas—later admitted taking part Sams, who gave the order to shoot Rackley at the murder scene, turned state's evidence and testified that he had received orders personally from Bobby Seale to carry out the execution Party supporters responded that Sams was himself the informant and an agent provocateur employed by the FBI [124] The case resulted in the New Haven Black Panther trials of 1970 Kimbro, Sams and McLucas were convicted of the murder, but the trials of Seale and Ericka Huggins ended with a hung jury, and the prosecution chose not to seek another trial.\n\n\nInternational ties\nActivists from many countries around the globe supported the Panthers and their cause In Scandinavian countries such as Norway and Finland, for example, left-wing activists organized a tour for Bobby Seale and Masai Hewitt in 1969 At each destination along the tour, the Panthers talked about their goals and the \"Free Huey!\" campaign Seale and Hewitt made a stop in Germany as well, gaining support for the \"Free Huey!\" campaign [125]\n\n\n1970\nIn 1970, a group of Panthers including Eldridge Cleaver and Elaine Brown traveled to Asia and they were welcomed as guests of the governments of China, [127]: 39  North Vietnam, and North Korea The group's first stop was in North Korea, where the Panthers met with local officials to discuss ways in

[129]\n\n\n1971–1974\nNewton focused the BPP on the Party's Oakland school and various other social service programs In early 1971, the BPP founded the \"Intercommunal Youth Institute\" in January 1971, [132] with the intent of demonstrating how black youth ought to be educated Ericka Huggins was the director of the school and Regina Davis was an administrator [133] The school was unique in that it did not have grade levels but instead had different skill levels so an 11-year-old could be in second-level English and fifth-level science [133] Elaine Brown taught reading and writing to a group of 10- to 11-year-olds deemed \"uneducable\" by the system [134] The school children were given free busing; breakfast, lunch, and dinner; books and school supplies; children were taken to have medical checkups; many children were given free clothes [135]\n\n\nSplit\nSignificant disagreements among the Party's leaders over how to confront ideological differences led to a split within the party Certain members felt that the Black Panthers should participate in local government and social services, while others encouraged constant conflict with the police For some of the Party's supporters, the separations among political action, criminal activity, social services, access to power, and grass-roots identity became confusing and contradictory as the Panthers' political momentum was bogged down in the criminal justice system These (and other) disagreements led to a split In January 1971, Newton expelled Geronimo Pratt who, since 1970, had been in jail facing a pending murder charge Newton also expelled two of the New York 21 and his own secretary, Connie Matthews, who fled the country.\n\n\nDelegation to China\nIn late September 1971, Huey P Newton led a delegation to China and stayed for 10 days [139] At every airport in China, Huey was greeted by thousands of people waving copies of the Little Red Book and displaying signs that said, \"We support the Black Panther Party, down with US imperialism\" or, \"We support the American people but the Nixon imperialist regime must be overthrown.\" During the trip, the Chinese delegate arranged for him to meet and have dinner with a DPRK ambassador, a Tanzanian ambassador, and delegations from both North Vietnam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam [140] Huey was under the impression he was going to meet Mao Zedong, but instead had two meetings with the first Premier of the People's Republic of China Zhou Enlai One of these meetings also included Mao Zedong's wife Jiang Qing Huey described China as \"a free and liberated territory with a socialist government.\" [141]\n\n\nNewton solidifies control and centralizes power in Oakland\nIn early 1972, the party began closing down dozens of chapters and branches all over the country and bringing members and operations to Oakland [142] The political arm of the Southern California chapter was shut down and its members moved to Oakland, although the underground military arm remained for a time [143] The underground remnants of the LA chapter, which had emerged from the Slausons street gang, eventually re-emerged as the Crips, a street gang who at first advocated social reform before devolving into racketeering [144] Minister of Education Ray \"Masai\" Hewitt created the Buddha Samurai, the party's underground security cadre in Oakland Newton expelled Hewitt from the party later in 1972, but the security cadre remained in operation under the leadership of Flores Forbes One of the cadre's main functions was to extort and rob drug dealers and after-hours clubs [143]\n\n\nNewton indicted for violent crimes\nIn 1974, Huey Newton and eight other Panthers were arrested and charged with assault on police officers In August 1974, Newton went into exile in Cuba to avoid prosecution for the murder of Kathleen Smith, an eighteen-year-old prostitute Newton was also indicted for pistol-whipping his tailor, Preston Callins Although Newton confided to friends that Kathleen Smith was his \"first nonpolitical murder\", he was ultimately acquitted, after one witness's testimony was impeached by her admission that she had been smoking marijuana on the night of the murder, and another prostitute witness recanted her testimony [145] [146] Newton was also acquitted of assaulting Preston Callins after Callins refused to press charges [147] [clarification needed]\n\n\n1974–1977\nIn 1974, as Huey Newton prepared to go into exile in Cuba, he appointed Elaine Brown as the first Chairwoman of the Party [148] Under Brown's leadership, the Party became involved in organizing for more radical electoral campaigns, including Brown's 1975 unsuccessful run for Oakland City Council [149] The Party supported Lionel Wilson in his successful election as the first black mayor of Oakland, in exchange for Wilson's assistance in having criminal charges dropped against Party member Flores Forbes, leader of the Buddha Samurai cadre [143]\n\n\nThe Panthers under Elaine Brown\nIn 1974, as Huey Newton prepared to go into exile in Cuba, he appointed Elaine Brown as the first Chairwoman of the Party [148] Under Brown's leadership, the Party became involved in organizing for more radical electoral campaigns, including Brown's 1975 unsuccessful run for Oakland City Council [149] The Party supported Lionel Wilson in his successful election as the first black mayor of Oakland, in exchange for Wilson's assistance in having criminal charges dropped against Party member Flores Forbes, leader of the Buddha Samurai cadre [143]\n\n\nDeath of Betty van Patter\nPanther leader Elaine Brown hired Betty Van Patter in 1974 as a bookkeeper Van Patter had previously served as a bookkeeper for Ramparts magazine and was introduced to the Panther leadership by David Horowitz, who had been the editor of Ramparts and a major fundraiser and board member for the Panther school [150] Later that year, after a dispute with Brown over financial irregularities, [151] Van Patter went missing on December 13, 1974 Some weeks later, her severely beaten corpse was found on a San Francisco Bay beach.\n\n\n1977–1982\nIn 1977, Newton returned from exile in Cuba, and received complaints from male members about the excessive power of women in the organization, who now outnumbered men According to Elaine Brown, Newton authorized the physical punishment of school administrator Regina Davis for scolding a male coworker Davis was hospitalized with a broken jaw [156] Brown said, \"The beating of Regina would be taken as a clear signal that the words 'Panther' and 'comrade' had taken a gender-on-gender connotation, denoting an inferiority in the female half of us.\" [157] [158] [159] Brown resigned from the party and fled to LA [160]\n\n\nReturn of Huey Newton and the demise of the party\nIn 1977, Newton returned from exile in Cuba, and received complaints from male members about the excessive power of women in the organization, who now outnumbered men According to Elaine Brown, Newton authorized the physical punishment of school administrator Regina Davis for scolding a male coworker Davis was hospitalized with a broken jaw [156] Brown said, \"The beating of Regina would be taken as a clear signal that the words 'Panther' and 'comrade' had taken a gender-on-gender connotation, denoting an inferiority in the female half of us.\" [157] [158] [159] Brown resigned from the party and fled to LA [160]\n\n\nPanthers attempt to assassinate a witness against Newton\nIn October 1977, Flores Forbes, the party's assistant chief of staff, led a botched attempt to assassinate Crystal Gray, a key prosecution witness in Newton's upcoming trial, who had been present the day of Kathleen Smith's murder When three Panthers attacked the wrong house by mistake, the occupant returned fire and killed one of the Panthers, Louis Johnson, while the other two assailants escaped [162] One of them, Flores Forbes, fled to Las Vegas, Nevada, with the help of Panther paramedic Nelson Malloy Fearing that Malloy would discover the truth behind the botched assassination attempt, Newton allegedly ordered a \"house cleaning\", and Malloy was shot and buried alive in the desert Although permanently paralyzed from the waist down, Malloy escaped and told police that fellow Panthers Rollin Reid and Allen Lewis were behind his attempted murder [163] Newton denied any involvement or knowledge and said the events \"might have been the result of overzealous party members\" [164] Newton was ultimately acquitted of the murder of Kathleen Smith, after Crystal Gray's testimony was impeached by her admission that she had smoked marijuana on the night of the murder, and he was acquitted of assaulting Preston Callins after Callins refused to press charges.\n\n\nWomen and womanism\nFrom its beginnings, the Black Panther Party championed black masculinity and traditional gender roles [165]: 6  A notice in the first issue of The Black Panther newspaper proclaimed the all-male organization as \"the cream of Black Manhood .. there for the protection and defense of our Black community\" [166] Scholars consider the Party's stance of armed resistance highly masculine, with guns and violence proving manhood [167]: 2  In 1968, several articles urged female Panthers to \"stand behind black men\" and be supportive [165]: 6  The first woman to join the party was Joan Tarika Lewis, in 1967 [168] [page needed]\n\n\nGender dynamics\nIn the beginning, recruiting women was a low priority for Newton and Seale [179] Seale stated in an interview that Newton targeted \"brothers who had been pimping, brothers who had been peddling dope, brothers who ain't gonna take no shit, brothers who had been fighting the pigs\" Also, they did not realize that women could help the fight until one came into an interest meeting asking about \"female leadership\" [180] Regina Jennings recalls that many male leaders had an \"unchecked\" sexism problem, and her task was to \"lift the bedroom out of their minds.\" She remembers overhearing members: \"Some concluded that the FBI sent me, but the captain assured them with salty good humor that, 'She's too stupid to be from the FBI.' He thought my cover and my comments too honest, too loud, and too ridiculous to be serious.\" She recalls her days in Oakland, California as a teenager looking for something to do to add purpose to her life and her community She grew up around police brutality, so it was nothing new Her goal in joining was \"smashing racism\" because she viewed herself as Black before she was a woman In her community, that identity is what she felt held her back the most [180]\n\n\nWomen's role\nThe Black Panther Party was involved in many community projects as part of their organization These projects included community outreach, like the breakfast program, education, and health programs [169] In many cases women were the ones primarily involved with administering these types of programs.\n\n\nElaine Brown\nElaine Brown rose to power within the BPP as Minister of Information after Eldridge Cleaver fled abroad In 1974, she became chair for the Oakland chapter She was appointed by Huey Newton, the previous chair, while Newton and other leaders dealt with their legal issues [169] [182] From the beginning of her tenure as chair, she faced opposition and feared a coup She appointed many female officials and faced backlash for her policies for equality within the organization When Huey Newton returned from exile and approved of the beating of a female Panther schoolteacher, Brown left the organization [182]\n\n\nGwen Robinson\nIn an interview with Judson Jeffries, Gwen Robinson reflects on her time in the Black Panther Party Detroit Division [183] She explains that she joined in October 1969 despite doubts from her mother, who had participated in a march with Martin Luther King Jr in the early part of the decade She chose the Black Panther Party (BPP) because \" [She] felt a closeness and a bond with them\" more than other organizations like the \"SNCC, NAACP, the Urban League, the Nation of Islam, Shrines of Madonna, Eastside Voice of Independent Detroit (ESVID), the Republic of New Africa, and the Revolutionary Action Movement.\" [183]\n\n\nConnections to other political activist groups\nMembers of the Black Panther Party, such as Huey P Newton, also frequently collaborated with Latino activist groups, like the Brown Berets and Los Siete de la Raza Newton himself even attended some court sessions for Los Siete de la Raza's trial in June 1970 [185]\n\n\nConnections to the Gay Liberation Movement\nHuey Newton expressed his support for the Women's liberation movement and the Gay liberation movement in a 1970 letter published in the newspaper The Black Panther titled \"A Letter from Huey to the Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters About the Women's Liberation and Gay Liberation Movements\" [186] Written one year after the Stonewall riots, Newton acknowledged women and homosexuals as oppressed groups and urged the Black Panthers to \"unite with them in a revolutionary fashion\" [187] The Black Panther Party and the Gay Liberation Movement shared common ground in their fight against police brutality [188]\n\n\nAftermath and legacy\nThere is considerable debate about the impact of the Black Panther Party on the wider society or even their local environments Author Jama Lazerow writes:\n\n\nGroups and movements inspired and aided by the Black Panthers\nVarious groups and movements have picked names inspired by the Black Panthers:\n\n\nNew Black Panther Party\nIn 1989, a \"New Black Panther Party\" was formed in Dallas, Texas Ten years later, the NBPP became home to many former Nation of Islam members when its chairmanship was taken by Khalid Abdul Muhammad.\n\n\nIn popular media\nMany former members of the Black Panther Party have gone on to write books and memoirs about their experiences in the party, such as Revolutionary Suicide, the autobiography of Huey P Newton, Seize the Time by Bobby Seal, Assata: An Autobiography by Assata Shakur, A Taste of Power by Elaine Brown, and many more.\n\n\nBooks\nMany former members of the Black Panther Party have gone on to write books and memoirs about their experiences in the party, such as Revolutionary Suicide, the autobiography of Huey P Newton, Seize the Time by Bobby Seal, Assata: An Autobiography by Assata Shakur, A Taste of Power by Elaine Brown, and many more.\n\n\nFilm\nThe Black Panther Party briefly appeared in 1994's Forrest Gump [208]\n\n\nArt\nIn 2019, the Museum of Modern Art acquired 30 issues of the Black Panther newspaper for its permanent collection In 2021, they were featured in a show and series of events highlighting the importance of the paper's artwork, with a selection to be placed on permanent display [210]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nGeneral and cited references\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**The Black Panther Party**\n\nThe Black Panther Party was a revolutionary organization founded in Oakland, California in 1966 by Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale. The party's primary goal was to empower and protect African Americans from police brutality and systemic racism. The Black Panther Party gained international attention for its militant stance and community programs.\n\n**History**\n\nDuring World War II, tens of thousands of black people left the Southern states during the Second Great Migration, moving to Oakland and other cities in the Bay Area to find work in the war industries such as Kaiser Shipyards. The sweeping migration transformed the Bay Area as well as cities throughout the West and North, altering the once white-dominated demographics. A new generation of young black people growing up in these cities faced new forms of poverty and racism unfamiliar to their parents, and they sought to develop new forms of politics to address them.\n\n**Founding**\n\nIn late October 1966, Huey P Newton and Bobby Seale founded the Black Panther Party (originally the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense) in formulating a new politics, they drew on their work with a variety of Black Power organizations. Newton and Seale first met in 1962 when they were both students at Merritt College. They joined Donald Warden's Afro-American Association, where they read widely, debated, and organized in an emergent black nationalist tradition inspired by Malcolm X and others.\n\n**Initial Tactics**\n\nThe party used contemporary open-carry gun laws to protect Party members when policing the police. This act was done to record incidents of police brutality by distantly following police cars around neighborhoods. When confronted by a police officer, Party members cited laws proving they had done nothing wrong and threatened to take to court any officer that violated their constitutional rights.\n\n**Panther Patrols**\n\nThe party eventually began armed patrols in Oakland black communities, which attracted a small handful of members. The number grew slightly starting in February 1967, when the party provided an armed escort at the San Francisco airport for Betty Shabazz, Malcolm X's widow and keynote speaker for a conference held in his honor.\n\n**Rallies in Richmond, California**\n\nThe black community of Richmond, California wanted protection against police brutality. With only three main streets for entering and exiting the neighborhood, it was easy for police to control, contain, and suppress the population. On April 1, 1967, a black unarmed twenty-two-year-old construction worker named Denzil Dowell was shot dead by police in North Richmond. The party held rallies in North Richmond that educated the community on armed self-defense and the Denzil Dowell incident.\n\n**Protest at the Statehouse**\n\nAwareness of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense grew rapidly after their May 2, 1967, protest at the California State Capitol. The protest was against the Mulford Act, which would make the public carrying of loaded firearms illegal. Huey Newton, with Minister of Information Eldridge Cleaver, put together a plan to send a group of 26 armed Panthers led by Seale from Oakland to Sacramento to protest the bill. The group entered the assembly carrying their weapons, an incident which was widely publicized, and which prompted police to arrest Seale and five others.\n\n**Ten-Point Program**\n\nThe Black Panther Party first publicized its original \"What We Want Now!\" Ten-Point program on May 15, 1967, following the Sacramento action, in the second issue of The Black Panther newspaper. The Ten-Point Program set forth the ideals and goals of the party, including the right to self-defense and the right to equal employment and equal housing.\n\n**Late 1967 to Early 1968**\n\nIn August 1967, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) instructed its program \"COINTELPRO\" to \"neutralize .. black nationalist hate groups\" and other dissident groups. The FBI Director J Edgar Hoover described the Black Panthers as \"the greatest threat to the internal security of the country\" in September 1968. By 1969, the Black Panthers and their allies had become primary COINTELPRO targets, singled out in 233 of the 295 authorized \"Black Nationalist\" COINTELPRO actions.\n\n**Killing of Fred Hampton and Mark Clark**\n\nIn Chicago, on December 4, 1969, two Panthers were killed when the Chicago Police raided the home of Panther leader Fred Hampton. The raid had been orchestrated by the police in conjunction with the FBI. Hampton was shot and killed, as was Panther guard Mark Clark. A federal investigation reported that only one shot was fired by the Panthers, and police fired at least 80 shots.\n\n**Torture-Murder of Alex Rackley**\n\nIn May 1969, three members of the New Haven chapter tortured and murdered Alex Rackley, a 19-year-old member of the New York chapter, because they suspected him of being a police informant. Three party officers—Warren Kimbro, George Sams, Jr., and Lonnie McLucas—later admitted taking part.\n\n**International Travels**\n\nIn 1968, the Black Panther Party began to gain international attention for its militant stance and community programs. The party sent a delegation to China in 1969, where they met with Chinese officials and were welcomed as guests of the Chinese government. The party also sent a delegation to North Vietnam in 1970, where they met with North Vietnamese officials and were welcomed as guests of the North Vietnamese government.\n\n**Newton's Exile**\n\nIn 1974, Huey Newton went into exile in Cuba to avoid prosecution for the murder of Kathleen Smith, an 18-year-old prostitute. Newton was acquitted of the murder, after one witness's testimony was impeached by her admission that she had smoked marijuana on the night of the murder.\n\n**Elaine Brown's Leadership**\n\nIn 1974, Elaine Brown became the chair of the Black Panther Party, following Huey Newton's exile. Brown led the party in its community programs and in its fight against police brutality. Brown also led the party in its efforts to elect radical candidates to office.\n\n**Women in the Black Panther Party**\n\nWomen played a significant role in the Black Panther Party, both as members and as leaders. Women such as Elaine Brown, Assata Shakur, and Angela Davis were prominent members of the party and played key roles in its leadership. The party also had a number of programs and initiatives that were specifically focused on the needs of women and girls.\n\n**Connections to Other Groups**\n\nThe Black Panther Party had connections to a number of other groups, both within the African American community and outside of it. The party worked closely with groups such as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and also had ties to groups such as the Nation of Islam and the Socialist Workers Party (SWP).\n\n**Aftermath and Legacy**\n\nThe Black Panther Party was a significant force in the Civil Rights Movement and in the fight against police brutality. The party's impact can still be seen today, both in the United States and around the world. The party's emphasis on community empowerment and self-defense continues to inspire activists and social justice movements. The party's legacy also serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle for racial justice and equality in the United States.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Black Panther Party was a revolutionary organization that played a significant role in the Civil Rights Movement and in the fight against police brutality. The party's emphasis on community empowerment and self-defense continues to inspire activists and social justice movements. The party's legacy also serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle for racial justice and equality in the United States.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about

once white-dominated demographics [32] A new generation of young black people growing up in these cities faced new forms of poverty and racism unfamiliar to their parents, and they sought to develop new forms of politics to address them [33] Black Panther Party membership \"consisted of recent migrants whose families traveled north and west to escape the southern racial regime, only to be confronted with new forms of segregation and repression\" [34] In the early 1960s, the Civil rights movement had dismantled the Jim Crow system of racial subordination in the South with tactics of non-violent civil disobedience, and demanding full citizenship rights for black people [35] However, not much changed in the cities of the North and West As the wartime and post-war jobs which drew much of the black migration \"fled to the suburbs along with white residents\", the black population was concentrated in poor \"urban ghettos\" with high unemployment and substandard housing and was mostly excluded from political representation, top universities, and the middle class [36] Northern and Western police departments were almost all white [37] In 1966, only 16 of Oakland's 661 police officers were African American (less than 2.5%) [38]\n\n\nOrigins\nDuring World War II, tens of thousands of black people left the Southern states during the Second Great Migration, moving to Oakland

officers were African American (less than 2.5%) [38]\n\n\nFounding\nIn late October 1966, Huey P Newton and Bobby Seale founded the Black Panther Party (originally the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense) [10] In formulating a new politics, they drew on their work with a variety of Black Power organizations [40] Newton and Seale first met in 1962 when they were both students at Merritt College [41] They joined Donald Warden's Afro-American Association, where they read widely, debated, and organized in an emergent black nationalist tradition inspired by Malcolm X and others [42] Eventually dissatisfied with Warden's accommodationism, they developed a revolutionary anti-imperialist perspective working with more active and militant groups like the Soul Students Advisory Council and the Revolutionary Action Movement [43] [44] Their paid jobs running youth service programs at the North Oakland Neighborhood Anti-Poverty Center allowed them to develop a revolutionary nationalist approach to community service, later a key element in the Black Panther Party's \"community survival programs.\" [45]\n\n\nLate 1966 to early 1967\nThe initial tactic of the party used contemporary open-carry gun laws to protect Party members when policing the police This act was done to record incidents of police brutality by distantly following police cars around neighborhoods [54] When confronted by a police officer, Party members cited laws proving they had done nothing wrong and threatened to take to court any officer that violated their constitutional rights [55] Between the end of 1966 to the start of 1967, the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense's armed police patrols in Oakland black communities attracted a small handful of members [56] Numbers grew slightly starting in February 1967, when the party provided an armed escort at the San Francisco airport for Betty Shabazz, Malcolm X's widow and keynote speaker for a conference held in his honor [57]\n\n\nOakland

speaker for a conference held in his honor [57]\n\n\nRallies in Richmond, California\nThe black community of Richmond, California wanted protection against police brutality [61] With only three main streets for entering and exiting the neighborhood, it was easy for police to control, contain, and suppress the population [62] On April 1, 1967, a black unarmed twenty-two-year-old construction worker named Denzil Dowell was shot dead by police in North Richmond [63] Dowell's family contacted the Black Panther Party for assistance after county officials refused to investigate the case [64] The Party held rallies in North Richmond that educated the community on armed self-defense and the Denzil Dowell incident [65] Police seldom interfered at these rallies because every Panther was armed and no laws were broken [66] The Party's ideals resonated with several community members, who then brought their own guns to the next rallies [67]\n\n\nProtest at the Statehouse\nAwareness of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense grew rapidly after their May 2, 1967, protest at the California State Capitol On May 2, 1967, the California State Assembly Committee on Criminal Procedure was scheduled to convene to discuss what was known as the \"Mulford Act,\" which would make the public carrying of loaded firearms illegal Newton, with Minister of Information Eldridge Cleaver, put together a plan to send a group of 26 armed Panthers led by Seale from Oakland to Sacramento to protest the bill The group entered the assembly carrying their weapons, an incident which was widely publicized, and which prompted police to arrest Seale and five others The group pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of disrupting a legislative session [68] At the time of the protest, the Party had fewer than 100 members in total [69]\n\n\nTen-point program\nThe Black Panther Party first publicized its original \"What We Want Now!\" Ten-Point program on May 15, 1967, following the Sacramento action, in the second issue of The Black Panther newspaper [57]\n\n\nLate 1967 to early 1968\nIn August 1967, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) instructed its program \"COINTELPRO\" to \"neutralize .. black nationalist hate groups\" and other dissident groups In September 1968, FBI Director J Edgar Hoover described the Black Panthers as \"the greatest threat to the internal security of the country\" [71] By 1969, the Black Panthers and their allies had become primary COINTELPRO targets, singled out in 233 of the 295 authorized \"Black Nationalist\" COINTELPRO actions [72] The goals of the program were to prevent the unification of militant black nationalist groups and to weaken their leadership, as well as to discredit them to reduce their support and growth The initial targets included the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, the Revolutionary Action Movement and the Nation of Islam, as well as leaders including the Rev Martin Luther King Jr., Stokely Carmichael, H Rap Brown, Maxwell Stanford and Elijah Muhammad As assistant FBI Director William Sullivan later testified in front of the Church Committee, the Bureau \"did not differentiate\" between Soviet spies and suspected Communists in black nationalist movements when deploying surveillance and neutralization tactics [73]\n\n\nCOINTELPRO\nIn August

movements when deploying surveillance and neutralization tactics [73]\n\n\nHuey Newton charged with murdering John Frey\nOn October 28, 1967, Oakland police officer John Frey was shot to death in an altercation with Huey P Newton during a traffic stop in which Newton and backup officer Herbert Heanes also sustained gunshot wounds Newton was convicted of voluntary manslaughter at trial, but the conviction was later overturned In his book Shadow of the Panther, writer Hugh Pearson alleges that Newton was intoxicated in the hours before the incident, and claimed to have willfully killed John Frey [78]\n\n\nFree Huey! campaign\nAt the time, Newton claimed that he had been falsely accused, leading to the Party's \"Free Huey!\" campaign The police killing gained the party even wider recognition by the radical American left [79] and it stimulated the growth of the Party nationwide [69] Newton was released after three years, when his conviction was reversed on appeal [80]\n\n\nFounding of the L. A. Chapter\nIn 1968 the southern California chapter was founded by Alprentice \"Bunchy\" Carter in Los Angeles Carter was the leader of the Slauson Street gang, and many of the L.A chapter's early recruits were Slausons [85]\n\n\nKilling of Bobby Hutton\nBobby James Hutton was born April 21, 1950, in Jefferson County, Arkansas At the age of three, he and his family moved to Oakland, California after being harassed by racist vigilante groups associated with the Ku Klux Klan In December 1966, he became the first treasurer and recruit of the Black Panther Party at the age of just 16 years old.\n\n\nLate 1968\nIn 1968, the group shortened its name to the Black Panther Party and sought to focus directly on political action Members were encouraged to carry guns and to defend themselves against violence An influx of college students joined the group, which had consisted chiefly of \"brothers off the block\" This created some tension in the group Some members were more interested in supporting the Panthers' social programs, while others wanted to maintain their \"street mentality\" [97]\n\n\nChronology\nIn 1970, a group of Panthers including Eldridge Cleaver and Elaine Brown traveled to Asia and they were welcomed as guests of the governments of China, [127]: 39  North Vietnam, and North Korea The group's first stop was in North Korea, where the Panthers met with local officials to discuss ways in which they could help each other fight against American imperialism Cleaver traveled to Pyongyang twice in 1969 and 1970 and following these trips he made an effort to publicize the writings and works of North Korean leader Kim Il Sung in the United States [128] After leaving North Korea, the group traveled to North Vietnam with the same agenda in mind: finding ways to put an end to American imperialism Eldridge Cleaver was invited to speak to Black GIs by the North Vietnamese government He encouraged them to join the Black Liberation Struggle by arguing that the United States government was only using them for its own purposes Instead of risking their lives on the battlefield for a country that continued to oppress them, Cleaver believed that the black GIs should risk their lives in support of their own liberation After leaving Vietnam, Cleaver met with the Chinese ambassador to Algeria to express their mutual animosity towards the American government [129]\n\n\nSurvival programs\nNo kid should be running around hungry in school.\n\n\nPolitical activities\nIn 1968, BPP Minister of Information Eldridge Cleaver ran for presidential office on the Peace and Freedom Party ticket [109] They were a big influence on the White Panther Party, tied to the Detroit/Ann Arbor band MC5 and their manager John Sinclair (author of the book Guitar Army), which also promulgated a ten-point program.\n\n\n1969\nViolent conflict between the Panther chapter in LA and the US Organization, a black nationalist group, resulted in shootings and beatings and led to the murders of at least four Black Panther Party members On January 17, 1969, Los Angeles Panther Captain Bunchy Carter and Deputy Minister John Huggins were killed in Campbell Hall on the UCLA campus, in a gun battle with members of the US Organization Another shootout between the two groups on March 17 led to further injuries Two more Panthers died.\n\n\nChronology\nIn 1970, a group of

group, resulted in shootings and beatings and led to the murders of at least four Black Panther Party members On January 17, 1969, Los Angeles Panther Captain Bunchy Carter and Deputy Minister John Huggins were killed in Campbell Hall on the UCLA campus, in a gun battle with members of the US Organization Another shootout between the two groups on March 17 led to further injuries Two more Panthers died.\n\n\nBlack Panther Party Education Programs and Liberation Schools\nParamount to their beliefs regarding the need for individual agency to catalyze community change, the Black Panther Party (BPP) strongly supported the education of the masses As part of their Ten-Point Program which set forth the ideals and goals of the party, they demanded an equitable education for all black people Study and reading was important for all would-be candidates of the Party, which included studying the Ten-Point Program, reading the Black Panther newspaper, and attending a series of political education classes as well as weapons training A 1968 \"Panther Party Book List\" was circulated in the party newspaper, recommending Panthers read the following titles (listed in order): [112]\n\n\nIntercommunal Youth Institute\nThe first Liberation School was opened by the Richmond Black Panthers in July 1969 with brunch served and snacks provided to students Another school was opened in Mt Vernon New York on July 17 of the subsequent year [113] These schools were informal in nature and more closely resembled after-school or summer programs [114] While these campuses were the first to open, the first full-time and longest-running Liberation School was opened in January 1971 in Oakland in response to the inequitable conditions in the Oakland Unified School District which was ranked one of the lowest-scoring districts in California [115] Named the Intercommunal Youth Institute (IYI), this school, under the directorship of Brenda Bay, and later Ericka Huggins, enrolled twenty-eight students in its first year, with the majority being the children of Black Panther parents This number grew to fifty by the 1973–1974 school year To provide full support for Black Panther parents whose time was spent organizing, some of the students and faculty members lived together year around The school itself was dissimilar to traditional schools in a variety of ways including the fact that students were separated by academic performance rather than age, and students were often provided one-on-one support as the faculty to student ratio was 1:10 [115]\n\n\nOakland Community School\nIn 1974, due to increased interest in enrolling in the school, school officials decided to move to a larger facility and subsequently changed the school's name to Oakland Community School During this year, the school graduated its first class [116] Although the student population continued to grow ranging between 50 and 150 between 1974 and 1977, the original core values of individualized instruction remained [115] In September 1977, the school received a special award from Governor Edmund Brown Jr and the California Legislature for \"having set the standard for the highest level of elementary education in the state [116]\n\n\nKilling of Fred Hampton and Mark Clark\nIn Chicago, on December 4, 1969, two Panthers were killed when the Chicago Police raided the home of Panther leader Fred Hampton The raid had been orchestrated by the police in conjunction with the FBI Hampton was shot and killed, as was Panther guard Mark Clark A federal investigation reported that only one shot was fired by the Panthers, and police fired at least 80 shots [118] The only shot fired by the Panthers was from Mark Clark, who appeared to fire a single round determined to be the result of a reflexive death convulsion after he was immediately struck in the chest by shots from the police at the start of the raid.\n\n\nTorture-murder of Alex Rackley\nIn May 1969, three members of the New Haven chapter tortured and murdered Alex Rackley, a 19-year-old member of the New York chapter, because they suspected him of being a police informant Three party officers—Warren Kimbro, George Sams, Jr., and Lonnie McLucas—later admitted taking part Sams, who gave the order to shoot Rackley at the murder scene, turned state's evidence and testified that he had received orders personally from Bobby Seale to carry out the execution Party supporters responded that Sams was himself the informant and an agent provocateur employed by the FBI [124] The case resulted in the New Haven Black Panther trials of 1970 Kimbro, Sams and McLucas were convicted of the murder, but the trials of Seale and Ericka Huggins ended with a hung jury, and the prosecution chose not to seek another trial.\n\n\nInternational ties\nActivists from many countries around the globe supported the Panthers and their cause In Scandinavian countries such as Norway and Finland, for example, left-wing activists organized a tour for Bobby Seale and Masai Hewitt in 1969 At each destination along the tour, the Panthers talked about their goals and the \"Free Huey!\" campaign Seale and Hewitt made a stop in Germany as well, gaining support for the \"Free Huey!\" campaign [125]\n\n\n1970\nIn 1970, a group of Panthers including Eldridge Cleaver and Elaine Brown traveled to Asia and they were welcomed as guests of the governments of China, [127]: 39  North Vietnam, and North Korea The group's first stop was in North Korea, where the Panthers met with local officials to discuss ways in

[129]\n\n\n1971–1974\nNewton focused the BPP on the Party's Oakland school and various other social service programs In early 1971, the BPP founded the \"Intercommunal Youth Institute\" in January 1971, [132] with the intent of demonstrating how black youth ought to be educated Ericka Huggins was the director of the school and Regina Davis was an administrator [133] The school was unique in that it did not have grade levels but instead had different skill levels so an 11-year-old could be in second-level English and fifth-level science [133] Elaine Brown taught reading and writing to a group of 10- to 11-year-olds deemed \"uneducable\" by the system [134] The school children were given free busing; breakfast, lunch, and dinner; books and school supplies; children were taken to have medical checkups; many children were given free clothes [135]\n\n\nSplit\nSignificant disagreements among the Party's leaders over how to confront ideological differences led to a split within the party Certain members felt that the Black Panthers should participate in local government and social services, while others encouraged constant conflict with the police For some of the Party's supporters, the separations among political action, criminal activity, social services, access to power, and grass-roots identity became confusing and contradictory as the Panthers' political momentum was bogged down in the criminal justice system These (and other) disagreements led to a split In January 1971, Newton expelled Geronimo Pratt who, since 1970, had been in jail facing a pending murder charge Newton also expelled two of the New York 21 and his own secretary, Connie Matthews, who fled the country.\n\n\nDelegation to China\nIn late September 1971, Huey P Newton led a delegation to China and stayed for 10 days [139] At every airport in China, Huey was greeted by thousands of people waving copies of the Little Red Book and displaying signs that said, \"We support the Black Panther Party, down with US imperialism\" or, \"We support the American people but the Nixon imperialist regime must be overthrown.\" During the trip, the Chinese delegate arranged for him to meet and have dinner with a DPRK ambassador, a Tanzanian ambassador, and delegations from both North Vietnam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam [140] Huey was under the impression he was going to meet Mao Zedong, but instead had two meetings with the first Premier of the People's Republic of China Zhou Enlai One of these meetings also included Mao Zedong's wife Jiang Qing Huey described China as \"a free and liberated territory with a socialist government.\" [141]\n\n\nNewton solidifies control and centralizes power in Oakland\nIn early 1972, the party began closing down dozens of chapters and branches all over the country and bringing members and operations to Oakland [142] The political arm of the Southern California chapter was shut down and its members moved to Oakland, although the underground military arm remained for a time [143] The underground remnants of the LA chapter, which had emerged from the Slausons street gang, eventually re-emerged as the Crips, a street gang who at first advocated social reform before devolving into racketeering [144] Minister of Education Ray \"Masai\" Hewitt created the Buddha Samurai, the party's underground security cadre in Oakland Newton expelled Hewitt from the party later in 1972, but the security cadre remained in operation under the leadership of Flores Forbes One of the cadre's main functions was to extort and rob drug dealers and after-hours clubs [143]\n\n\nNewton indicted for violent crimes\nIn 1974, Huey Newton and eight other Panthers were arrested and charged with assault on police officers In August 1974, Newton went into exile in Cuba to avoid prosecution for the murder of Kathleen Smith, an eighteen-year-old prostitute Newton was also indicted for pistol-whipping his tailor, Preston Callins Although Newton confided to friends that Kathleen Smith was his \"first nonpolitical murder\", he was ultimately acquitted, after one witness's testimony was impeached by her admission that she had been smoking marijuana on the night of the murder, and another prostitute witness recanted her testimony [145] [146] Newton was also acquitted of assaulting Preston Callins after Callins refused to press charges [147] [clarification needed]\n\n\n1974–1977\nIn 1974, as Huey Newton prepared to go into exile in Cuba, he appointed Elaine Brown as the first Chairwoman of the Party [148] Under Brown's leadership, the Party became involved in organizing for more radical electoral campaigns, including Brown's 1975 unsuccessful run for Oakland City Council [149] The Party supported Lionel Wilson in his successful election as the first black mayor of Oakland, in exchange for Wilson's assistance in having criminal charges dropped against Party member Flores Forbes, leader of the Buddha Samurai cadre [143]\n\n\nThe Panthers under Elaine Brown\nIn 1974, as Huey Newton prepared to go into exile in Cuba, he appointed Elaine Brown as the first Chairwoman of the Party [148] Under Brown's leadership, the Party became involved in organizing for more radical electoral campaigns, including Brown's 1975 unsuccessful run for Oakland City Council [149] The Party supported Lionel Wilson in his successful election as the first black mayor of Oakland, in exchange for Wilson's assistance in having criminal charges dropped against Party member Flores Forbes, leader of the Buddha Samurai cadre [143]\n\n\nDeath of Betty van Patter\nPanther leader Elaine Brown hired Betty Van Patter in 1974 as a bookkeeper Van Patter had previously served as a bookkeeper for Ramparts magazine and was introduced to the Panther leadership by David Horowitz, who had been the editor of Ramparts and a major fundraiser and board member for the Panther school [150] Later that year, after a dispute with Brown over financial irregularities, [151] Van Patter went missing on December 13, 1974 Some weeks later, her severely beaten corpse was found on a San Francisco Bay beach.\n\n\n1977–1982\nIn 1977, Newton returned from exile in Cuba, and received complaints from male members about the excessive power of women in the organization, who now outnumbered men According to Elaine Brown, Newton authorized the physical punishment of school administrator Regina Davis for scolding a male coworker Davis was hospitalized with a broken jaw [156] Brown said, \"The beating of Regina would be taken as a clear signal that the words 'Panther' and 'comrade' had taken a gender-on-gender connotation, denoting an inferiority in the female half of us.\" [157] [158] [159] Brown resigned from the party and fled to LA [160]\n\n\nReturn of Huey Newton and the demise of the party\nIn 1977, Newton returned from exile in Cuba, and received complaints from male members about the excessive power of women in the organization, who now outnumbered men According to Elaine Brown, Newton authorized the physical punishment of school administrator Regina Davis for scolding a male coworker Davis was hospitalized with a broken jaw [156] Brown said, \"The beating of Regina would be taken as a clear signal that the words 'Panther' and 'comrade' had taken a gender-on-gender connotation, denoting an inferiority in the female half of us.\" [157] [158] [159] Brown resigned from the party and fled to LA [160]\n\n\nPanthers attempt to assassinate a witness against Newton\nIn October 1977, Flores Forbes, the party's assistant chief of staff, led a botched attempt to assassinate Crystal Gray, a key prosecution witness in Newton's upcoming trial, who had been present the day of Kathleen Smith's murder When three Panthers attacked the wrong house by mistake, the occupant returned fire and killed one of the Panthers, Louis Johnson, while the other two assailants escaped [162] One of them, Flores Forbes, fled to Las Vegas, Nevada, with the help of Panther paramedic Nelson Malloy Fearing that Malloy would discover the truth behind the botched assassination attempt, Newton allegedly ordered a \"house cleaning\", and Malloy was shot and buried alive in the desert Although permanently paralyzed from the waist down, Malloy escaped and told police that fellow Panthers Rollin Reid and Allen Lewis were behind his attempted murder [163] Newton denied any involvement or knowledge and said the events \"might have been the result of overzealous party members\" [164] Newton was ultimately acquitted of the murder of Kathleen Smith, after Crystal Gray's testimony was impeached by her admission that she had smoked marijuana on the night of the murder, and he was acquitted of assaulting Preston Callins after Callins refused to press charges.\n\n\nWomen and womanism\nFrom its beginnings, the Black Panther Party championed black masculinity and traditional gender roles [165]: 6  A notice in the first issue of The Black Panther newspaper proclaimed the all-male organization as \"the cream of Black Manhood .. there for the protection and defense of our Black community\" [166] Scholars consider the Party's stance of armed resistance highly masculine, with guns and violence proving manhood [167]: 2  In 1968, several articles urged female Panthers to \"stand behind black men\" and be supportive [165]: 6  The first woman to join the party was Joan Tarika Lewis, in 1967 [168] [page needed]\n\n\nGender dynamics\nIn the beginning, recruiting women was a low priority for Newton and Seale [179] Seale stated in an interview that Newton targeted \"brothers who had been pimping, brothers who had been peddling dope, brothers who ain't gonna take no shit, brothers who had been fighting the pigs\" Also, they did not realize that women could help the fight until one came into an interest meeting asking about \"female leadership\" [180] Regina Jennings

It has been a fundamental concept in many areas, serving as a reference point, a placeholder, or a representation of the absence or absence of value.\n\n**Science, technology, and mathematics**\n\nIn science, technology, and mathematics, null is often used as a placeholder or a reference point. For instance, in mathematics, the concept of null or zero is used as a fundamental building block for arithmetic operations, and it serves as a reference point for measuring quantities.\n\n## Null in mathematics\n\nIn mathematics, null is often used to represent the absence of value or the concept of nothingness. For example, in set theory, the empty set, often denoted as ∅, is considered a null set, as it contains no elements. In calculus, the concept of null infinity, often represented as ∞, is used to describe a point at which a function or a sequence approaches zero.\n\n## Null in physics\n\nIn physics, null is often used to represent the absence of energy, momentum, or other physical quantities. For instance, in quantum mechanics, the concept of a null vector is used to describe a particle that has no momentum or energy. In general relativity, the concept of null geodesics is used to describe the path of light through spacetime.\n\n## Null in computer science\n\nIn computer science, null is often used as a placeholder or a reference point in programming languages. For instance, in object-oriented programming, the concept of null object is used to represent an object that has no value or properties. In database systems, the concept of null value is used to represent missing or unknown data.\n\n**Astronomy**\n\nIn astronomy, null is often used to represent the absence of signal or the concept of nothingness. For instance, in radio astronomy, the concept of null radio source is used to describe a point in the sky where there is no radiation detected. In cosmology, the concept of null energy density is used to describe the energy density of the vacuum.\n\n## Null in cosmology\n\nIn cosmology, null is often used to describe the energy density of the vacuum. For instance, the concept of null energy density is used to describe the energy density of the vacuum in the context of the cosmological constant. The concept of null curvature is used to describe the curvature of spacetime in the context of flat space.\n\n## Null in astrophysics\n\nIn astrophysics, null is often used to describe the absence of signal or the concept of nothingness. For instance, the concept of null point is used to describe a point in a magnetic field where the field is zero. The concept of null flux is used to describe the flux of energy or particles through a surface.\n\n**Computing**\n\nIn computing, null is often used as a placeholder or a reference point in programming languages. For instance, in object-oriented programming, the concept of null object is used to represent an object that has no value or properties. In database systems, the concept of null value is used to represent missing or unknown data.\n\n## Null in programming languages\n\nIn programming languages, null is often used to represent the absence of value or the concept of nothingness. For instance, in C and C++, the concept of null pointer is used to represent a pointer that points to no location in memory. In Java, the concept of null object is used to represent an object that has no value or properties.\n\n## Null in database systems\n\nIn database systems, null is often used to represent missing or unknown data. For instance, in relational databases, the concept of null value is used to represent missing or unknown data in a table. In NoSQL databases, the concept of null value is used to represent missing or unknown data in a document.\n\n**Mathematics**\n\nIn mathematics, null is often used to represent the absence of value or the concept of nothingness. For instance, in set theory, the empty set, often denoted as ∅, is considered a null set, as it contains no elements. In calculus, the concept of null infinity, often represented as ∞, is used to describe a point at which a function or a sequence approaches zero.\n\n## Null in algebra\n\nIn algebra, null is often used to represent the absence of value or the concept of nothingness. For instance, in group theory, the concept of null group is used to describe a group that has no non-identity elements. In ring theory, the concept of null ring is used to describe a ring that has no non-zero elements.\n\n## Null in geometry\n\nIn geometry, null is often used to represent the absence of value or the concept of nothingness. For instance, in Euclidean geometry, the concept of null vector is used to describe a vector that has no direction or magnitude. In non-Euclidean geometry, the concept of null curvature is used to describe the curvature of spacetime in the context of flat space.\n\n**Physics**\n\nIn physics, null is often used to represent the absence of energy, momentum, or other physical quantities. For instance, in quantum mechanics, the concept of a null vector is used to describe a particle that has no momentum or energy. In general relativity, the concept of null geodesics is used to describe the path of light through spacetime.\n\n## Null in mechanics\n\nIn mechanics, null is often used to represent the absence of energy or momentum. For instance, in classical mechanics, the concept of null energy is used to describe a system that has no energy. In quantum mechanics, the concept of null momentum is used to describe a particle that has no momentum.\n\n## Null in electromagnetism\n\nIn electromagnetism, null is often used to represent the absence of electric or magnetic field. For instance, in electrostatics, the concept of null electric field is used to describe a region where the electric field is zero. In magnetostatics, the concept of null magnetic field is used to describe a region where the magnetic field is zero.\n\n**Arts and media**\n\nIn arts and media, null is often used as a creative concept or a metaphor. For instance, in literature, the concept of null is used to describe a character who has no identity or purpose. In film, the concept of null is used to describe a character who has no motivation or goal.\n\n## Null in art\n\nIn art, null is often used as a creative concept or a metaphor.

[41] however, most critics found \"her desolate soundscapes inaccessible.\" [22] Anne Marie Micklo of Rolling Stone gave the album a positive review, calling side two \"a really worthwhile venture into musical infinity\" [32] A cult following emerged around it, [52] which included music journalist Lester Bangs, who wrote in a 1978 article entitled \"Your Shadow Is Scared of You: An Attempt Not to Be Frightened by Nico\": \"The Marble Index is the greatest piece of 'avant-garde classical', 'serious' music of the last half of the 20th century so far.\" [34] Although Bangs praised the album, he also wrote that it \"scared the shit out of  [him]\" and described the listening experience as \"self-torture\" [34]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe Marble Index has a sound which distinguishes it from the musical landscape of the 1960s Anthony Thornton of NME called it \"a stark, oppressive opus that has influenced everyone from PJ Harvey to the Duke Spirit [27] According to Spin, \" [The Marble Index] set the tone for decades of music to come – Arthur Russell, Dead Can Dance, Fennesz, Zola Jesus, Grouper, pretty much every metal band that ever used a harpsichord – but few followers have sailed so near to the edge of the abyss with such chillingly beautiful results.\" [12] The Canadian rock band The Marble Index is named after Nico's album.\n\n\nAccolades\nAll tracks are written by Nico.\n\nTrack listing\nAll tracks are written by Nico.\n\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from The Marble Index's liner notes [41]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "William_Tecumseh_Sherman", "content": "\nEarly life\nSherman was born in 1820 in Lancaster, Ohio, near the banks of the Hocking River His father, Charles Robert Sherman, a lawyer who was a justice on the Ohio Supreme Court, [11] died unexpectedly of typhoid fever in 1829 [12] His widow, Mary Hoyt Sherman, remained with eleven children and no inheritance Nine-year-old Sherman was raised by a Lancaster neighbor and family friend, attorney Thomas Ewing Ewing was a prominent member of the Whig Party who became U.S senator for Ohio and the first Secretary of the Interior Sherman was distantly related to US founding father Roger Sherman [13]\n\n\nNames\nSherman's unusual given name has always attracted attention One 19th-century source, for example, states that \"General Sherman, we believe, is the only eminent American named from an Indian chief\" [16] According to Sherman's Memoirs, he was named William Tecumseh because his father had \"caught a fancy for the great chief of the Shawnees, 'Tecumseh'\" [17] However, Lloyd Lewis's 1932 biography claimed that Sherman was originally named only Tecumseh and that he acquired the name William at the age of nine or ten, when he was baptized as a Catholic at the behest of his foster family According to Lewis's account, which was repeated by later authors, Sherman was baptized in the Ewing home by a Dominican priest who found the pagan name Tecumseh unsuitable and instead named the child William after the saint on whose feast day the baptism took place [18] Sherman had already been baptized as an infant by a Presbyterian minister [19] [20] and recent biographers believe, contrary to Lewis's claims, that he was probably given the first name William at that time [21] [22] As an adult, Sherman signed all his correspondence, including to his wife, \"W T Sherman\" [23] His friends and family called him Cump [24]\n\n\nMilitary training and service\nSenator Ewing secured an appointment for the 16-year-old Sherman as a cadet in the United States Military Academy at West Point [25] Sherman roomed with and befriended another important future Civil War general for the Union, George Henry Thomas Sherman excelled academically at West Point, but he treated the demerit system with indifference [26] Fellow cadet William Rosecrans remembered Sherman as \"one of the brightest and most popular fellows\" at the academy and as \"a bright-eyed, red-headed fellow, who was always prepared for a lark of any kind\" [27] About his time at West Point, Sherman says only the following in his Memoirs:\n\n\nMarriage and business career\nOn May 1, 1850, Sherman married his foster sister, Ellen Boyle Ewing, who was four years and eight months his junior Ellen's father, Thomas Ewing, was the US Secretary of the Interior at that time Father James A Ryder, president of Georgetown College, officiated at the Washington, D.C., ceremony President Zachary Taylor, Vice President Millard Fillmore and other political luminaries attended the wedding [44] Ellen Ewing Sherman was a devout Catholic, and the couple's children were reared in that faith [45]\n\n\nMilitary college superintendent\nIn 1859, Sherman accepted a job as the first superintendent of the Louisiana State Seminary of Learning & Military Academy in Pineville, Louisiana, a position he sought at the suggestion of Major Don Carlos Buell and obtained through the support of General George Mason Graham [58] Sherman was an effective and popular leader of the institution, which would later become Louisiana State University [59] Colonel Joseph P Taylor, brother of the late President Zachary Taylor, declared that \"if you had hunted the whole Army, from one end of it to the other, you could not have found a man in it more admirably suited for the position in every respect than Sherman.\" [60]\n\n\nSt. Louis interlude\nSherman departed Louisiana and traveled to Washington, D.C., possibly in the hope of securing a position in the U.S Army At the White House, Sherman met with Abraham Lincoln a few days after his inauguration as president of the United States Sherman expressed grave concerns about the North's poor state of preparedness for the looming civil war, but he found Lincoln unresponsive [67] [68]\n\n\nCivil War service\nSherman was first commissioned as colonel of the 13th U.S Infantry Regiment, effective May 14, 1861 This was a new regiment yet to be raised In fact, Sherman's first command was a brigade of three-month volunteers who fought in the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861 [76] It was one of the four brigades in the division commanded by General Daniel Tyler, which was in turn one of the five divisions in the Army of Northeastern Virginia under General Irvin McDowell [77]\n\n\nFirst commissions and Bull Run\nSherman was first commissioned as colonel of the 13th U.S Infantry Regiment, effective May 14, 1861 This was a new regiment yet to be raised In fact, Sherman's first command was a brigade of three-month volunteers who fought in the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861 [76] It was one of the four brigades in the division commanded by General Daniel Tyler, which was in turn one of the five divisions in the Army of Northeastern Virginia under General Irvin McDowell [77]\n\n\nKentucky and breakdown\nHaving succeeded Anderson at Louisville, Sherman now had principal military responsibility for Kentucky, a border state in which the Confederates held Columbus and Bowling Green, and were also present near the Cumberland Gap [b] He became exceedingly pessimistic about the outlook for his command and he complained frequently to Washington about shortages, while providing exaggerated estimates of the strength of the rebel forces and requesting inordinate numbers of reinforcements Critical press reports about Sherman began to appear after the U.S Secretary of War, Simon Cameron, visited Louisville in October 1861 In early November, Sherman asked to be relieved of his command [83] [84] He was promptly replaced by Don Carlos Buell and transferred to St Louis In December, he was put on leave by Henry W Halleck, commander of the Department of the Missouri, who found him unfit for duty and sent him to Lancaster, Ohio, to recuperate [85] While he was at home, his wife Ellen wrote to his brother, Senator John Sherman, seeking advice and complaining of \"that melancholy insanity to which your family is subject\" [86] In his private correspondence, Sherman later wrote that the concerns of command \"broke me down\" and admitted to having contemplated suicide [87] His problems were compounded when the Cincinnati Commercial described him as \"insane\" [88]\n\n\nShiloh\nAfter Grant captured Fort Donelson, Sherman got his wish to serve under Grant when he was assigned on March 1, 1862, to the Army of West Tennessee as commander of the 5th Division [92] His first major test under Grant was at the Battle of Shiloh The massive Confederate attack on the morning of April 6 took most of the senior Union commanders by surprise Sherman had dismissed the intelligence reports from militia officers, refusing to believe that Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston would leave his base at Corinth He took no precautions beyond strengthening his picket lines, and refused to entrench, build abatis, or send out reconnaissance patrols At Shiloh, he may have wished to avoid appearing overly alarmed in order to escape the kind of criticism he had received in Kentucky Indeed, he had written to his wife that if he took more precautions \"they'd call me crazy again\" [93] Despite being caught unprepared by the attack, Sherman rallied his division and conducted an orderly, fighting retreat that helped avert a disastrous Union rout.\n\n\nVicksburg\nIn November 1862, Grant, acting as commander of the Union forces in the state of Mississippi, launched a campaign to capture the city of Vicksburg, the principal Confederate stronghold along the Mississippi River [100] Grant made Sherman a corps commander and put him in charge of half of his forces [101] According to historian John D Winters's The Civil War in Louisiana (1963), at this stage Sherman\n\n\nChattanooga\nAfter the surrender of Vicksburg and the re-capture of Jackson, Sherman was given the rank of brigadier general in the regular army, in addition to his rank as a major general of volunteers [115] His family traveled from Ohio to visit him at the camp near Vicksburg Sherman's nine-year-old son, Willie, the \"Little Sergeant\", died from typhoid fever contracted during the trip [116] [117]\n\n\nAtlanta\nThe Meridian campaign marked the end of Sherman's brief tenure as commander of the Army of the Tennessee Sherman had, up to that point, achieved mixed success as a general, and controversy attached especially to his performance at Chattanooga [124] However, he enjoyed Grant's confidence and friendship [125] When Lincoln called Grant east in the spring of 1864 to take command of all the Union armies, Grant appointed Sherman (by then known to his soldiers as \"Uncle Billy\") to succeed him as head of the Military Division of the Mississippi, which entailed command of Union troops in the Western Theater of the war [126] As Grant took overall command of the armies of the United States, Sherman wrote to him outlining his strategy to bring the war to an end: \"If you can whip Lee and I can march to the Atlantic I think ol' Uncle Abe  [Lincoln] will give us twenty days leave to see the young folks.\" [127]\n\n\nMarch to the Sea\nDuring September and October, Sherman and Hood played a cat-and-mouse game in northern Georgia and Alabama, as Hood threatened Sherman's communications to the north Eventually, Sherman won approval from his superiors for a plan to cut loose from his communications and march south, having advised Grant that he could \"make Georgia howl\" [137] In response, Hood moved north into Tennessee Sherman at first trivialized the corresponding threat, reportedly saying that he would \"give  [Hood] his rations\" to go in that direction, as \"my business is down south\" [138] [139] Sherman left forces under Major Generals George H Thomas and John M Schofield to deal with Hood; their forces eventually smashed Hood's army in the battles of Franklin (November 30) and Nashville (December 15–16) [140]\n\n\nFinal campaigns in the Carolinas\nGrant then ordered Sherman to embark his army on steamers and join the Union forces confronting Lee in Virginia, but Sherman instead persuaded Grant to allow him to march north through the Carolinas, destroying everything of military value along the way, as he had done in Georgia He was particularly interested in targeting South Carolina, the first state to secede from the Union, because of the effect that it would have on Southern morale [150] [151] His army proceeded north through South Carolina against light resistance from the troops of General Johnston Upon hearing that Sherman's men were advancing on corduroy roads through the Salkehatchie swamps at a rate of a dozen miles per day, Johnston \"made up his mind that there had been no such army in existence since the days of Julius Caesar\" [152]\n\n\nConfederate surrender\nFollowing Lee's surrender and the assassination of Lincoln, Sherman met with Johnston on April 17, 1865, at Bennett Place in Durham, North Carolina, to negotiate a Confederate surrender At the insistence of Johnston, Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and Secretary of War John C Breckinridge, Sherman conditionally agreed to generous terms that dealt with both military and political issues On April 20, Sherman dispatched a memorandum with those terms to the government in Washington [162]\n\n\nSlavery and emancipation\nSherman was not an abolitionist before the war and, like others of his time and background, he did not believe in \"Negro equality\" [168] [169] [170] Before the war, Sherman expressed some sympathy with the view of Southern whites that the black race was benefiting from slavery, although he opposed breaking up slave families and advocated that laws forbidding the education of slaves be repealed [171] [172] [173] Throughout the Civil War, Sherman declined to employ black troops in his armies [174] [175]\n\n\nStrategies\nSherman's military legacy rests primarily on his command of logistics and on his brilliance as a strategist The influential 20th-century British military historian and theorist B. H Liddell Hart ranked Sherman as \"the first modern general\" and one of the most important strategists in the annals of war, along with Scipio Africanus, Belisarius, Napoleon Bonaparte, T. E Lawrence, and Erwin Rommel [194] Liddell Hart's views on the historical significance of Sherman have since been discussed and, to varying extents, defended by subsequent military scholars such as Jay Luvaas, [195] Victor Davis Hanson, [196] and Brian Holden-Reid [197]\n\n\nManeuver warfare\nLiddell Hart credited Sherman with mastery of maneuver warfare, also known as the \"indirect approach\" In maneuver warfare, a commander seeks to defeat the enemy on the battleground through shock, disruption, and surprise, while minimizing frontal attacks on well-defended positions According to Liddell Hart, this strategy was most clearly illustrated by Sherman's series of turning movements against Johnston during the Atlanta campaign [198] Liddell Hart also declared that the study of Sherman's campaigns had contributed significantly to his own \"theory of strategy and tactics in mechanized warfare\", and claimed that this had in turn influenced Heinz Guderian's doctrine of Blitzkrieg and Rommel's use of tanks during the Second World War [199] [200] [e] Another World War II-era student of Liddell Hart's writings on Sherman was General George S Patton, [201] who \"spent a long vacation studying Sherman's campaigns on the ground in Georgia and the Carolinas, with the aid of  [Liddell Hart's] book\" and later \"carried out his  [bold] plans, in super-Sherman style\" [202]\n\n\nHard war\nLike Grant and Lincoln, Sherman was convinced that the Confederacy's strategic, economic, and psychological ability to wage further war needed to be crushed if the fighting were to end Therefore, he believed that the North had to conduct its campaign as a war of conquest, employing scorched earth tactics to break the backbone of the rebellion Historian Mark Grimsley promoted the use of the term \"hard war\" to refer to this strategy in the context of the American Civil War [203] [204] [f] Sherman's advance through Georgia and the Carolinas was characterized by widespread destruction of civilian supplies and infrastructure This strategy has been characterized by some military historians as an early form of total war, although the appropriateness of that term has been questioned by many scholars Holden-Reid, for instance, argued that \"the concept of 'total war' is deeply flawed, an imprecise label that at best describes the two world wars but is of dubious relevance to the U.S Civil War.\" [206]\n\n\nPostwar service\nIn May 1865, after the major Confederate armies had surrendered, Sherman wrote in a personal letter:\n\n\nIndian Wars\nThere was little large-scale military action against the Indians during the first three years of Sherman's tenure as divisional commander, as Sherman allowed negotiations between the U.S government and Indian leaders to proceed, while he built up his troops and awaited completion of the Union Pacific and Kansas Pacific Railroads During this time, he was a member of the Indian Peace Commission Though the commission was responsible for the negotiation of the Medicine Lodge Treaty and the Treaty of Fort Laramie, Sherman did not have a significant role in the drafting of those treaties because in both cases he was called away to Washington during the negotiations [230] In one instance, he was summoned to testify as a witness in the impeachment of Andrew Johnson [231] He testified in the trial on April 11 and 13, 1868 [232] He successfully negotiated other treaties, such as the removal of Navajos from the Bosque Redondo to traditional lands in Western New Mexico [231]\n\n\nGeneral of the Army\nWhen Grant became president in 1869, Sherman was appointed Commanding General of the United States Army and promoted to the rank of full general After the death of John A Rawlins, Sherman also served for one month as acting Secretary of War [245]\n\n\nFinal years\nSherman lived most of the rest of his life in New York City He was devoted to the theater and to amateur painting and was in demand as a colorful speaker at dinners and banquets, in which he indulged a fondness for quoting Shakespeare [10] [265] During this period, he remained in contact with war veterans, and he was an active member of various social and charitable organizations [266]\n\n\nDeath\nSherman died of pneumonia in New York City at 1:50 PM on February 14, 1891, six days after his 71st birthday [273] President Benjamin Harrison, who served under Sherman, sent a telegram to Sherman's family and ordered all national flags to be flown at half staff Harrison, in a message to the Senate and the House of Representatives, wrote that:\n\n\nReligious views\nSherman's birth family was Presbyterian and he was originally baptized as such His foster mother, Maria Ewing, was devoutly Catholic and raised her own children in that faith Sherman was re-baptized as a Catholic, but Maria's husband, Senator Thomas Ewing, insisted that the young Sherman not be compelled to practice Catholicism Sherman observed but did not join in the religious ceremonies of the Ewing household [280] He later married his foster sister Ellen, who was also a devout Catholic In 1864, she took up temporary residence in South Bend, Indiana in order to have her young family educated at the University of Notre Dame and St Mary's College, both Catholic institutions [281]\n\n\nHistorical reputation\nSince the public mind has settled to the conclusion that the institution of slavery was so interwoven in our system that nothing but the interposition of Providence and horrid war could have eradicated it, and now that it is in the distant past, and that we as a nation, North and South, East and West, are the better for it, we believe that the war was worth to us all it cost in life and treasure – W T Sherman (1887) [292]\n\n\nMonuments and tributes\nThe gilded bronze Sherman Memorial (1902) by Augustus Saint-Gaudens stands at the Grand Army Plaza near the main entrance to New York City's Central Park [311] Sherman is represented astride his horse Ontario and led by a winged female figure of Victory [311] Saint-Gaudens's Bust of William Tecumseh Sherman, which he used as the basis for the larger Memorial, is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art [312] Arlington National Cemetery features a smaller version of Saint-Gaudens's statue of Victory [313]\n\n\nDates of rank\nThis is actually a re-printing of the second,

He was born on February 8, 1820, in Lancaster, Ohio, to Charles Robert Sherman and Mary Hoyt Sherman. His father was a lawyer who served as a justice on the Ohio Supreme Court until his death in 1829. Sherman's mother, Mary, remained with their eleven children and managed the family's household.\n\n## Names\n\nSherman's given name was William Tecumseh, which has been the subject of much attention throughout his life.

His mother, Mary, struggled to provide for their children, and Sherman was sent to live with a neighbor and family friend, attorney Thomas Ewing, who would later become a prominent member of the Whig Party and U.S. senator for Ohio. Ewing was also the father of Sherman's foster sister, Ellen, whom Sherman would later marry.\n\n## Military Training and Service\n\nSherman's military career began when he was appointed as a cadet in the United States Military Academy at West Point at the age of 16. He excelled academically at West Point, but his behavior was often erratic, and he was not popular with his instructors. Despite this, he graduated 32nd out of 59 cadets in the class of 1840.\n\n## Marriage and Business Career\n\nOn May 1, 1850, Sherman married his foster sister, Ellen Boyle Ewing, who was four years and eight months his junior.

in Lancaster, Ohio, near the banks of the Hocking River His father, Charles Robert Sherman, a lawyer who was a justice on the Ohio Supreme Court, [11] died unexpectedly of typhoid fever in 1829 [12] His widow, Mary Hoyt Sherman, remained with eleven children and no inheritance Nine-year-old Sherman was raised by a Lancaster neighbor and family friend, attorney Thomas Ewing Ewing was a prominent member of the Whig Party who became U.S senator for Ohio and the first Secretary of the Interior Sherman was distantly related to US founding father Roger Sherman [13]\n\n\nNames\nSherman's unusual given name has always attracted attention One 19th-century source, for example, states that \"General Sherman, we believe, is the only eminent American named from an Indian chief\" [16] According to Sherman's Memoirs, he was named William Tecumseh because his father had \"caught a fancy for the great chief of the Shawnees, 'Tecumseh'\" [17] However, Lloyd Lewis's 1932 biography claimed that Sherman was originally named only Tecumseh and that he acquired the name William at the age of nine or ten, when he was baptized as a Catholic at the behest of his foster family According to Lewis's account, which was repeated by later authors, Sherman was baptized in the Ewing home by a Dominican priest who found the pagan name Tecumseh unsuitable and instead named the child William after the saint on whose feast day the baptism took place [18] Sherman had already been baptized as an infant by a Presbyterian minister [19] [20] and recent biographers believe, contrary to Lewis's claims, that he was probably given the first name William at that time [21] [22] As an adult, Sherman signed all his correspondence, including to his wife, \"W T Sherman\" [23] His friends and family called him Cump [24]\n\n\nMilitary training and service\nSenator Ewing secured an appointment for the 16-year-old Sherman as a cadet in the United States Military Academy at West Point [25] Sherman roomed with and befriended another important future Civil War general for the Union, George Henry Thomas Sherman excelled academically at West Point, but he treated the demerit system with indifference [26] Fellow cadet William Rosecrans remembered Sherman as \"one of the brightest and most popular fellows\" at the academy and as \"a bright-eyed, red-headed fellow, who was always prepared for a lark of any kind\" [27] About his time at West Point, Sherman says only the following in his Memoirs:\n\n\nMarriage and business career\nOn May 1, 1850, Sherman married his foster sister, Ellen Boyle Ewing, who was four years and eight months his junior Ellen's father, Thomas Ewing, was the US Secretary of the Interior at that time Father James A Ryder, president of Georgetown College, officiated at the Washington, D.C., ceremony President Zachary Taylor, Vice President Millard Fillmore and other political luminaries attended the wedding [44] Ellen Ewing Sherman was a devout Catholic, and the couple's children were reared in that faith [45]\n\n\nMilitary college superintendent\nIn 1859, Sherman accepted a job as the first superintendent of the Louisiana State Seminary of Learning & Military Academy in Pineville, Louisiana, a position he sought at the suggestion of Major Don Carlos Buell and obtained through the support of General George Mason Graham [58] Sherman was an effective and popular leader of the institution, which would later become Louisiana State University [59] Colonel Joseph P Taylor, brother of the late President Zachary Taylor, declared that \"if you had hunted the whole Army, from one end of it to the other, you could not have found a man in it more admirably suited for the position in every respect than Sherman.\" [60]\n\n\nSt. Louis interlude\nSherman departed Louisiana and traveled to Washington, D.C., possibly in the hope of securing a position in the U.S Army At the White House, Sherman met with Abraham Lincoln a few days after his inauguration as president of the United States Sherman expressed grave concerns about the North's poor state of preparedness for the looming civil war, but he found Lincoln unresponsive [67] [68]\n\n\nCivil War service\nSherman was first commissioned as colonel of the 13th U.S Infantry Regiment, effective May 14, 1861 This was a new regiment yet to be raised In fact, Sherman's first command was a brigade of three-month volunteers who fought in the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861 [76] It was one of the four brigades in the division commanded by General Daniel Tyler, which was in turn one of the five divisions in the Army of Northeastern Virginia under General Irvin McDowell [77]\n\n\nFirst commissions and Bull Run\nSherman was first commissioned as colonel of the 13th U.S Infantry Regiment, effective May 14, 1861 This was a new regiment yet to be raised In fact, Sherman's first command was a brigade of three-month volunteers who fought in the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861 [76] It was one of the four brigades in the division commanded by General Daniel Tyler, which was in turn one of the five divisions in the Army of Northeastern Virginia under General Irvin McDowell [77]\n\n\nKentucky and breakdown\nHaving succeeded Anderson at Louisville, Sherman now had principal military responsibility for Kentucky, a border state in which the Confederates held Columbus and Bowling Green, and were also present near the Cumberland Gap [b] He became exceedingly pessimistic about the outlook for his command and he complained frequently to Washington about shortages, while providing exaggerated estimates of the strength of the rebel forces and requesting inordinate numbers of reinforcements Critical press reports about Sherman began to appear after the U.S Secretary of War, Simon Cameron, visited Louisville in October 1861 In early November, Sherman asked to be relieved of his command [83] [84] He was promptly replaced by Don Carlos Buell and transferred to St Louis In December, he was put on leave by Henry W Halleck, commander of the Department of the Missouri, who found him unfit for duty and sent him to Lancaster, Ohio, to recuperate [85] While he was at home, his wife Ellen wrote to his brother, Senator John Sherman, seeking advice and complaining of \"that melancholy insanity to which your family is subject\" [86] In his private correspondence, Sherman later wrote that the concerns of command \"broke me down\" and admitted to having contemplated suicide [87] His problems were compounded when the Cincinnati Commercial described him as \"insane\" [88]\n\n\nShiloh\nAfter Grant captured Fort Donelson, Sherman got his wish to serve under Grant when he was assigned on March 1, 1862, to the Army of West Tennessee as commander of the 5th Division [92] His first major test under Grant was at the Battle of Shiloh The massive Confederate attack on the morning of April 6 took most of the senior Union commanders by surprise Sherman had dismissed the intelligence reports from militia officers, refusing to believe that Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston would leave his base at Corinth He took no precautions beyond strengthening his picket lines, and refused to entrench, build abatis, or send out reconnaissance patrols At Shiloh, he may have wished to avoid appearing overly alarmed in order to escape the kind of criticism he had received in Kentucky Indeed, he had written to his wife that if he took more precautions \"they'd call me crazy again\" [93] Despite being caught unprepared by the attack, Sherman rallied his division and conducted an orderly, fighting retreat that helped avert a disastrous Union rout.\n\n\nVicksburg\nIn November 1862, Grant, acting as commander of the Union forces in the state of Mississippi, launched a campaign to capture the city of Vicksburg, the principal Confederate stronghold along the Mississippi River [100] Grant made Sherman a corps commander and put him in charge of half of his forces [101] According to historian John D Winters's The Civil War in Louisiana (1963), at this stage Sherman\n\n\nChattanooga\nAfter the surrender of Vicksburg and the re-capture of Jackson, Sherman was given the rank of brigadier general in the regular army, in addition to his rank as a major general of volunteers [115] His family traveled from Ohio to visit him at the camp near Vicksburg Sherman's nine-year-old son, Willie, the \"Little Sergeant\", died from typhoid fever contracted during the trip [116] [117]\n\n\nAtlanta\nThe Meridian campaign marked the end of Sherman's brief tenure as commander of the Army of the Tennessee Sherman had, up to that point, achieved mixed success as a general, and controversy attached especially to his performance at Chattanooga [124] However, he enjoyed Grant's confidence and friendship [125] When Lincoln called Grant east in the spring of 1864 to take command of all the Union armies, Grant appointed Sherman (by then known to his soldiers as \"Uncle Billy\") to succeed him as head of the Military Division of the Mississippi, which entailed command of Union troops in the Western Theater of the war [126] As Grant took overall command of the armies of the United States, Sherman wrote to him outlining his strategy to bring the war to an end: \"If you can whip Lee and I can march to the Atlantic I think ol' Uncle Abe  [Lincoln] will give us twenty days leave to see the young folks.\" [127]\n\n\nMarch to the Sea\nDuring September and October, Sherman and Hood played a cat-and-mouse game in northern Georgia and Alabama, as Hood threatened Sherman's communications to the north Eventually, Sherman won approval from his superiors for a plan to cut loose from his communications and march south, having advised Grant that he could \"make Georgia howl\" [137] In response, Hood moved north into Tennessee Sherman at first trivialized the corresponding threat, reportedly saying that he would \"give  [Hood] his rations\" to go in that direction, as \"my business is down south\" [138] [139] Sherman left forces under Major Generals George H Thomas and John M Schofield to deal with Hood; their forces eventually smashed Hood's army in the battles of Franklin (November 30) and Nashville (December 15–16) [140]\n\n\nFinal campaigns in the Carolinas\nGrant then ordered Sherman to embark his army on steamers and join the Union forces confronting Lee in Virginia, but Sherman instead persuaded Grant to allow him to march north through the Carolinas, destroying everything of military value along the way, as he had done in Georgia He was particularly interested in targeting South Carolina, the first state to secede from the Union, because of the effect that it would have on Southern morale [150] [151] His army proceeded north through South Carolina against light resistance from the troops of General Johnston Upon hearing that Sherman's men were advancing on corduroy roads through the Salkehatchie swamps at a rate of a dozen miles per day, Johnston \"made up his mind that there had been no such army in existence since the days of Julius Caesar\" [152]\n\n\nConfederate surrender\nFollowing Lee's surrender and the assassination of Lincoln, Sherman met with Johnston on April 17, 1865, at Bennett Place in Durham, North Carolina, to negotiate a Confederate surrender At the insistence of Johnston, Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and Secretary of War John C Breckinridge, Sherman conditionally agreed to generous terms that dealt with both military and political issues On April 20, Sherman dispatched a memorandum with those terms to the government in Washington [162]\n\n\nSlavery and emancipation\nSherman was not an abolitionist before the war and, like others of his time and background, he did not believe in \"Negro equality\" [168] [169] [170] Before the war, Sherman expressed some sympathy with the view of Southern whites that the black race was benefiting from slavery, although he opposed breaking up slave families and advocated that laws forbidding the education of slaves be repealed [171] [172] [173] Throughout the Civil War, Sherman declined to employ black troops in his armies [174] [175]\n\n\nStrategies\nSherman's military legacy rests primarily on his command of logistics and on his brilliance as a strategist The influential 20th-century British military historian and theorist B. H Liddell Hart ranked Sherman as \"the first modern general\" and one of the most important strategists in the annals of war, along with Scipio Africanus, Belisarius, Napoleon Bonaparte, T. E Lawrence, and Erwin Rommel [194] Liddell Hart's views on the historical significance of Sherman have since been discussed and, to varying extents, defended by subsequent military scholars such as Jay Luvaas, [195] Victor Davis Hanson, [196] and Brian Holden-Reid [197]\n\n\nManeuver warfare\nLiddell Hart credited Sherman with mastery of maneuver warfare, also known as the \"indirect approach\" In maneuver warfare, a commander seeks to defeat the enemy on the battleground through shock, disruption, and surprise, while minimizing frontal attacks on well-defended positions According to Liddell Hart, this strategy was most clearly illustrated by Sherman's series of turning movements against Johnston during the Atlanta campaign [198] Liddell Hart also declared that the study of Sherman's campaigns had contributed significantly to his own \"theory of strategy and tactics in mechanized warfare\", and claimed that this had in turn influenced Heinz Guderian's doctrine of Blitzkrieg and Rommel's use of tanks during the Second World War [199] [200] [e] Another World War II-era student of Liddell Hart's writings on Sherman was General George S Patton, [201] who \"spent a long vacation studying Sherman's campaigns on the ground in Georgia and the Carolinas, with the aid of  [Liddell Hart's] book\" and later \"carried out his  [bold] plans, in super-Sherman style\" [202]\n\n\nHard war\nLike Grant and Lincoln, Sherman was convinced that the Confederacy's strategic, economic, and psychological ability to wage further war needed to be crushed if the fighting were to end Therefore, he believed that the North had to conduct its campaign as a war of conquest, employing scorched earth tactics to break the backbone of the rebellion Historian Mark Grimsley promoted the use of the term \"hard war\" to refer to this strategy in the context of the American Civil War [203] [204] [f] Sherman's advance through Georgia and the Carolinas was characterized by widespread destruction of civilian supplies and infrastructure This strategy has been characterized by some military historians as an early form of total war, although the appropriateness of that term has been questioned by many scholars Holden-Reid, for instance, argued that \"the concept of 'total war' is deeply flawed, an imprecise label that at best describes the two world wars but is of dubious relevance to the U.S Civil War.\" [206]\n\n\nPostwar service\nIn May 1865, after the major Confederate armies had surrendered, Sherman wrote in a personal letter:\n\n\nIndian Wars\nThere was little large-scale military action against the Indians during the first three years of Sherman's tenure as divisional commander, as Sherman allowed negotiations between the U.S government and Indian leaders to proceed, while he built up his troops and awaited completion of the Union Pacific and Kansas Pacific Railroads During this time, he was a member of the Indian Peace Commission Though the commission was responsible for the negotiation of the Medicine Lodge Treaty and the Treaty of Fort Laramie, Sherman did not have a significant role in the drafting of those treaties because in both cases he was called away to Washington during the negotiations [230] In one instance, he was summoned to testify as a witness in the impeachment of Andrew Johnson [231] He testified in the trial on April 11 and 13, 1868 [232] He successfully negotiated other treaties, such as the removal of Navajos from the Bosque Redondo to traditional lands in Western New Mexico [231]\n\n\nGeneral of the Army\nWhen Grant became president in 1869, Sherman was appointed Commanding General of the United States Army and promoted to the rank of full general After the death of John A Rawlins, Sherman also served for one month as acting Secretary of War [245]\n\n\nFinal years\nSherman lived most of the rest of his life in New York City He was devoted to the theater and to amateur painting and was in demand as a colorful speaker at dinners and banquets, in which he indulged a fondness for quoting Shakespeare [10] [265] During this period, he remained in contact with war veterans, and he was an active member of various social and charitable organizations [266]\n\n\nDeath\nSherman died of pneumonia in New York City at 1:50 PM on February 14, 1891, six days after his 71st birthday [273] President Benjamin Harrison, who served under Sherman, sent a telegram to Sherman's family and ordered all national flags to be flown at half staff Harrison, in a message to the Senate and the House of Representatives, wrote that:\n\n\nReligious views\nSherman's birth family was Presbyterian and he was originally baptized as such His foster mother, Maria Ewing, was devoutly Catholic and raised her own children in that faith Sherman was re-baptized as a Catholic, but Maria's husband, Senator Thomas Ewing, insisted that the young Sherman not be compelled to practice Catholicism Sherman observed but did not join in the religious ceremonies of the Ewing household [280] He later married his foster sister Ellen, who was also a devout Catholic In 1864, she took up temporary residence in South Bend, Indiana in order to have her young family educated at the University of Notre Dame and St Mary's College, both Catholic institutions [281]\n\n\nHistorical reputation\nSince the public mind has settled to the conclusion that the institution of slavery was so interwoven in our system that nothing but the interposition of Providence and horrid war could have eradicated it, and now that it is in the distant past, and that we as a nation, North and South, East and West, are the better for it, we believe that the war was worth to us all it cost in life and treasure – W T Sherman (1887) [292]\n\n\nMonuments and tributes\nThe gilded bronze Sherman Memorial (1902) by Augustus Saint-Gaudens stands at the Grand Army Plaza near the main entrance to New York City's Central Park [311] Sherman is represented astride his horse Ontario and led by a winged female figure of Victory [311] Saint-Gaudens's Bust of William Tecumseh Sherman, which he used as the basis for the larger Memorial, is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art [312] Arlington National Cemetery features a smaller version of Saint-Gaudens's statue of Victory [313]\n\n\nDates of rank\nThis

points However, the addition and removal of images, and alterations to titles, cast and crew names, character names, and plot summaries are subject to an approval process; this usually takes between 24 and 72 hours.\n\n\nUser ratings of films\nAs one adjunct to data, the IMDb offers a rating scale that allows users to rate titles on a scale of one to ten.\n\n\nRankings\nThe IMDb Top 250 is a list of the top rated 250 films, based on ratings by registered users of the website using the methods described As of 5 September 2023 [update], The Shawshank Redemption, directed by Frank Darabont, is No 1 on the list, and has been since 2008 [6] [7] [8] The \"Top 250\" rating is based on only the ratings of \"regular voters\" The number of votes a registered user would have to make to be considered as a user who votes regularly has been kept secret IMDb has stated that to maintain the effectiveness of the Top 250 list they \"deliberately do not disclose the criteria used for a person to be counted as a regular voter\" [9] In addition to other weightings, the Top 250 films are also based on a weighted rating formula referred to in actuarial science as a credibility formula [10] This label arises because a statistic is taken to be more credible the greater the number of individual pieces of information; in this case from eligible users who submit ratings Although the current formula is not disclosed, IMDb originally used the following formula to calculate their weighted rating: [11]\n\n\nReference view\nIMDb originally used a more sidebar/list-based view on title pages However, in 2010 the site updated pages to more free-flowing layouts, and offered logged-in users an \"advanced view\" site preference setting called \"Combined view\", or this could be done on an ad-hoc basis by simply adding /combined to the end of the URL (e.g https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2358891/combined), for users to choose should they prefer the older page view display method or to aid the editing of data.\n\n\nMessage boards\nBeginning in 2001, the Internet Movie Database also maintained message boards for every title (excepting, as of 2013, TV episodes, which used the same message board for the whole series) and name entry, along with over 140 main boards To post on the message boards a user needed to \"authenticate\" their account via cell phone, credit card, or by having been

about actresses with beautiful eyes Others with similar interests soon responded with additions or different lists of their own Needham subsequently started an \"Actors List\", while Dave Knight began a \"Directors List\", and Andy Krieg took over \"THE LIST\" from Hank Driskill, which would later be renamed the \"Actress List\" Both lists had been restricted to people who were alive and working,

"**Introduction**\n\nThe Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is a comprehensive online database of information related to films, television programs, and video games. The website, founded in 1990, has become a go-to resource for movie and television enthusiasts, industry professionals, and anyone looking for information about films and their cast and crew. With over 250 million monthly users, IMDb is one of the most popular websites in the world. This article will provide an in-depth look at the features, history, and statistics of IMDb.\n\n**Features**\n\nThe title and talent pages of IMDb are accessible to all users, but only registered and logged-in users can submit new material and suggest edits to existing entries. Most of the site's data has been provided by these volunteers. Registered users with a proven track record are able to add and make corrections to cast lists, credits, and some other data points. However, the addition and removal of images, and alterations to titles, cast and crew names, character names, and plot summaries are subject to an approval process; this usually takes between 24 and 72 hours.\n\n**User Ratings of Films**\n\nAs an adjunct to data, the IMDb offers a rating scale that allows users to rate titles on a scale of one to ten. The ratings are based on the opinions of registered users who have voted on the title. The ratings are then used to calculate a weighted average, which is displayed on the title page.\n\n**Rankings**\n\nThe IMDb Top 250 is a list of the top rated 250 films, based on ratings by registered users of the website. The list is updated daily and is based on the weighted average of user ratings. The \"Top 250\" rating is based on only the ratings of \"regular voters.\" The number of votes a registered user would have to make to be considered as a user who votes regularly has been kept secret. IMDb has stated that to maintain the effectiveness of the Top 250 list they \"deliberately do not disclose the criteria used for a person to be counted as a regular voter.\" In addition to other weightings, the Top 250 films are also based on a weighted rating formula referred to in actuarial science as a credibility formula.\n\n**Reference View**\n\nIMDb originally used a more sidebar/list-based view on title pages. However, in 2010 the site updated pages to more free-flowing layouts, and offered logged-in users an \"advanced view\" site preference setting called \"Combined view,\" or this could be done on an ad-hoc basis by simply adding /combined to the end of the URL (e.g., https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2358891/combined), for users to choose should they prefer the older page view display method or to aid the editing of data.\n\n**Message Boards**\n\nBeginning in 2001, the Internet Movie Database also maintained message boards for every title (excepting, as of 2013, TV episodes, which used the same message board for the whole series) and name entry, along with over 140 main boards. To post on the message boards a user needed to \"authenticate\" their account via cell phone, credit card, or by having been a recent customer of the parent company Amazon.com. Message boards expanded in recent years. The Soapbox started in 1999 as a general message board meant for debates on any subjects. The Politics board started in 2007 was a message board to discuss politics, news events, and current affairs, as well as history and economics.\n\n**IMDbPro**\n\nActors, crew, and industry executives can post their own resume and upload photos of themselves for a yearly membership fee to IMDbPro. IMDbPro can be accessed by anyone willing to pay the annual fee of US$149.99. Membership enables a user to access the rank order of each industry personality, as well as agent contact information for any actor, producer, director, etc., that has an IMDb page. IMDbPro also allows existing actors to claim their name page, as well as production companies to claim titles they own/manage. Enrolling in IMDbPro enables members who are industry personnel to upload a head shot to open their page, as well as to upload hundreds of photos to accompany their page. Anyone can register as an IMDb user and contribute to the site as well as view its content; however, those users enrolled in IMDbPro have greater access and privileges.\n\n**History**\n\nIMDb originated in 1990 with a Usenet posting entitled \"Those Eyes,\" by the English film fan and computer programmer Col Needham, about actresses with beautiful eyes. Others with similar interests soon responded with additions or different lists of their own. Needham subsequently started an \"Actors List,\" while Dave Knight began a \"Directors List,\" and Andy Krieg took over \"THE LIST\" from Hank Driskill, which would later be renamed the \"Actress List.\" Both lists had been restricted to people who were alive and working, but soon retired people were added, so Needham started what was then (but did not remain) a separate \"Dead Actors/Actresses List.\" Steve Hammond started collecting and merging character names for both the actors and actresses lists. When these achieved popularity, they were merged back into the lists themselves. The goal of the participants now was to make the lists as inclusive as possible.\n\n**Pre-Website**\n\nIMDb originated in 1990 with a Usenet posting entitled \"Those Eyes,\" by the English film fan and computer programmer Col Needham, about actresses with beautiful eyes.

The goal of the participants now was to make the lists as inclusive as possible.\n\n**On the Web**\n\nThe database had been expanded to include additional categories of filmmakers and other demographic material as well as trivia, biographies, and plot summaries. The movie ratings had been properly integrated with the list data, and a centralized email interface for querying the database had been created by Alan Jay. Later, on August 5, 1993, it moved onto the fledgling World Wide Web under the name of Cardiff Internet Movie Database. The database resided on the servers of the computer science department of Cardiff University in Wales. Rob Hartill was the original web interface author. In 1994, the email interface was revised to accept the submission of all information, which enabled people to email the specific list maintainer with their updates. However, the structure remained so that information received on a single film was divided among multiple section managers, the sections being defined and determined by categories of film personnel and the individual filmographies contained therein. Over the next few years, the database was run on a network of mirrors across the world with donated bandwidth.\n\n**As an Independent Company**\n\nIn 1996 IMDb was incorporated in the United Kingdom, becoming the Internet Movie Database Ltd. Founder Col Needham became the primary owner. General revenue for site operations was generated through advertising, licensing, and partnerships.\n\n**As Amazon.com Subsidiary (1998-Present)**\n\nIn 1998, Jeff Bezos, founder, owner, and CEO of Amazon.com, struck a deal with Needham and other principal shareholders to buy IMDb outright; Amazon paid $55 million for IMDb and two other companies. Bezos attached it to Amazon as a subsidiary, private company. This gave IMDb the ability to pay the shareholders salaries for their work. In the process of expanding its product line, Amazon.com intended to use IMDb as an advertising resource for selling DVDs and videotapes.\n\n**Content and Format**\n\nIn 2006, IMDb introduced its \"Résumé Subscription Service,\" where an actor or crew member can post their résumé and upload photos for a yearly fee.

However, credit is not given on specific title or filmography pages to the contributor(s) who have provided information.

Professionals who have appeared in its annual \"top 10 lists\" are considered for this award. IMDb determines its definitive top 10 lists using data from IMDbPro STARmeter rankings, which are based on the actual page views of the more than 200 million monthly visitors to the site.

definitive top 10 lists using data from IMDbPro STARmeter rankings, which are based on the actual page views of the more than 200 million monthly visitors to the site.\" [62] Initially IMDb STARmeter

given to prominent artists of the industry who have appeared in the top 10 positions throughout the year [64] Salma Hayek received the inaugural award [64]\n\n\nLegal and policy issues\nIn 2011, in the case of Hoang v Amazon.com, Inc., IMDb was sued by an anonymous actress for at least US$1,075,000 because the movie website publicly disclosed her age (40, at the time) without her consent [65] The actress claimed that revealing her age could cause her to lose acting opportunities [66] Judge Marsha J Pechman, a US district judge in Seattle, dismissed the lawsuit, saying the actress had no grounds to proceed with an anonymous complaint The actress re-filed and so revealed that she was Huong Hoang of Texas, who uses the stage name Junie Hoang [67] In 2013, Pechman dismissed all causes of action except for a breach of contract claim against IMDb; a jury then sided with IMDb on that claim [68] The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court judgment in March 2015

{"title": "Bill_Gates", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nWilliam Henry Gates III was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington [3] as the only son of William H Gates Sr [b] (1925–2020) and his first wife, Mary Maxwell Gates (1929–1994) [4] His ancestry includes English, German, and Irish/Scots-Irish [5] His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors of First Interstate BancSystem and United Way of America Gates's maternal grandfather J W Maxwell was a national bank president Gates also has an older sister Kristi (Kristianne) and a younger sister Libby He is the fourth of his name in his family but is known as William Gates III or \"Trey\" (i.e., three) because his father had the \"II\" suffix [6] [7] The family lived in the Sand Point area of Seattle in a home that was damaged by a rare tornado when Gates was 7 [8]\n\n\nMicrosoft\nGates read the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics which demonstrated the Altair 8800, and contacted Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) to inform them that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform [35] In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a demonstration, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter The demonstration was held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, New Mexico; it was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC MITS hired Allen, [36] and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with him at MITS in November 1975 Allen named their partnership \"Micro-Soft\", a combination of \"microcomputer\" and \"software\", and their first office was in Albuquerque The first employee Gates and Allen hired was their high school collaborator Ric Weiland [36] They dropped the hyphen within a year and officially registered the trade name \"Microsoft\" with the Secretary of the State of New Mexico on November 26, 1976 [36] Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.\n\n\nBASIC\nGates read the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics which demonstrated the Altair 8800, and contacted Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems

officially registered the trade name \"Microsoft\" with the Secretary of the State of New Mexico on November 26, 1976 [36] Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.\n\n\nIBM partnership\nIBM, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time, approached Microsoft in July 1980 concerning software for its upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC, [41] after Gates's mother mentioned Microsoft to John Opel, IBM's then CEO [42] IBM first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter IBM's representatives also mentioned that they needed an operating system, and Gates referred them to Digital Research (DRI), makers of the widely used CP/M operating system [43] IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly and they did not reach a licensing agreement IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and asked if Microsoft could provide an operating system A few weeks later, Gates and Allen proposed using 86-DOS, an operating system similar to CP/M, that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC [44] Microsoft made a deal with SCP to be the exclusive licensing agent of 86-DOS, and later the full owner Microsoft employed Paterson to adapt the operating system for the PC [45] and delivered it to IBM as PC DOS for a one-time fee of $50,000 [46]\n\n\nWindows\nMicrosoft and Gates launched their first retail version of Microsoft Windows on November 20, 1985, in an attempt to fend off competition from Apple's Macintosh GUI, which had captivated consumers with its simplicity and ease of use [50] In August 1986, the company struck a deal with IBM to develop a separate operating system called OS/2 Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, the partnership deteriorated due to mounting creative differences [51] The operating system grew out of DOS in an organic fashion over a decade until Windows 95, which hid the DOS prompt by default Windows XP was released one year after Gates stepped down as Microsoft CEO [52] Windows 8.1 was the last version of the OS released before Gates left the chair of the firm to John W Thompson on February 5, 2014 [53]\n\n\nManagement style\nDuring Microsoft's early years, Gates was an active software developer, particularly in the company's programming language products, but his primary role in most of the company's history was as a manager and executive He has not officially been on a development team since working on the TRS-80 Model 100, [54] but he wrote code that shipped with the company's products as late as 1989 [55] Jerry Pournelle wrote in 1985 when Gates announced Microsoft Excel: \"Bill Gates likes the program, not because it's going to make him a lot of money (although I'm sure it will do that), but because it's a neat hack.\" [56] During the late 1990s, he was criticized for his business tactics, which were considered anti-competitive This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings [57]\n\n\nPost-Microsoft\nSince leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft, Gates has continued his philanthropy and works on other projects He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 to become technology advisor at the firm to support newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella [60] [61]\n\n\nBusiness ventures and investments\nGates has a multi-billion dollar investment portfolio with stakes in companies in multiple sectors and has participated in several entrepreneurial ventures beyond Microsoft, including:\n\n\nClimate change and energy\nGates considers climate change and global access to energy to be critical, interrelated issues He has urged governments and the private sector to invest in research and development to make clean, reliable energy cheaper Gates envisions that a breakthrough innovation in sustainable energy technology could drive down both greenhouse gas emissions and poverty, and bring economic benefits by stabilizing energy prices [106] In 2011, he said: \"If you gave me the choice between picking the next 10 presidents or ensuring that energy is environmentally friendly and a quarter as costly, I'd pick the energy thing.\" [107]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nIn October 2024, The New York Times reported Gates had recently donated $50 million to Future Forward USA Action, a 501(c)(4) organization supporting Kamala Harris's 2024 presidential campaign In response to the report, he did not explicitly address the donation or endorse Harris, but said \"this election is different.\" [120]\n\n\nRegulation of the software industry\nIn 1998, Gates rejected the need for regulation of the software industry in testimony before the United States Senate [121] During the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) investigation of Microsoft in the 1990s, Gates was reportedly upset at then Commissioner Dennis Yao for \"float [ing] a line of hypothetical questions suggesting possible curbs on Microsoft's growing monopoly power\" According to one source:\n\n\nDonald Trump Facebook ban\nAfter Facebook and Twitter had banned Donald Trump from their platforms on February 18, 2021, as a result of the 2020 United States presidential election which led to the January 6 United States Capitol attack, Gates said a permanent ban of Trump \"would be a shame\" and would be an \"extreme measure\" He warned that it would cause \"polarization\" if users with different political views divide up among various social networks, and said: \"I don't think banning somebody who actually did get a fair number of votes (in the presidential election) – well less than a majority – but I don't think having him off forever would be that good.\" [121]\n\n\nPatents for COVID-19 vaccines\nIn April 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Gates was criticized for suggesting that pharmaceutical companies should hold onto patents for COVID-19 vaccines The criticism came due to the possibility of this preventing poorer nations from obtaining adequate vaccines Tara Van Ho of the University of Essex stated, \"Gates speaks as if all the lives being lost in India are inevitable but eventually the West will help when in reality the US & UK are holding their feet on the neck of developing states by refusing to break  [intellectual property rights] protections It's disgusting.\" [123]\n\n\nCryptocurrencies\nGates has been critical of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin According to him, cryptocurrencies provide no \"valuable output\", contribute nothing to society, and pose a danger especially for smaller investors who could not survive the potentially high losses Gates also does not own any cryptocurrencies himself [128]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nGates studied the work of Andrew Carnegie and John D Rockefeller, and donated some of his Microsoft stock in 1994 to create the \"William H Gates Foundation\" In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations and donated stock valued at $5 billion to create the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the world's largest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6 billion [129] [130] The foundation allows benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the Wellcome Trust [131] [132] Gates, through his foundation, also donated $20 million to the Carnegie Mellon University for a new building to be named Gates Center for Computer Science which opened in 2009 [133] [134]\n\n\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation\nGates studied the work of Andrew Carnegie and John D Rockefeller, and donated some

foundation, also donated $20 million to the Carnegie Mellon University for a new building to be named Gates Center for Computer Science which opened in 2009 [133] [134]\n\n\nPersonal donations\nMelinda Gates suggested that people should emulate the philanthropic efforts of the Salwen family, who sold their home and gave away half of its value, as detailed in their book, The Power of Half [144] Gates and his wife invited Joan Salwen to Seattle to speak about what the family had done, and on December 9, 2010, Bill and Melinda Gates and investor Warren Buffett each signed a commitment they called the \"Giving Pledge\", which is a commitment by all three to donate at least half of their wealth, over the course of time, to charity [145] [146] [147] The Foundation has received criticism, particularly over its role in Common Core, with critics stating the support is \"cronyist\" in that it profits from the \"federal, state, and local contracts.\" [148] [149] [150] [151]\n\n\nCharity sports events\nIn April 2017, Gates partnered with Swiss tennis player Roger Federer in playing in the Match for Africa 4, a noncompetitive tennis match at a sold-out Key Arena in Seattle The event was in support of the Roger Federer Foundation's charity efforts in Africa [167] Federer and Gates played against John Isner, the top-ranked American player for much of this decade, and Mike McCready, the lead guitarist for Pearl Jam The pair won the match 6 games to 4 Overall, they raised $2 million for children in Africa [168] The following year, Gates and Federer returned to play in the Match for Africa 5 on March 5, 2018, at San Jose's SAP Center Their opponents were Jack Sock, one of the top American players and a grand slam winner in doubles, and Savannah Guthrie, a co-anchor for NBC's Today show Gates and Federer recorded their second match victory together by a score of 6–3 and the event raised over $2.5 million [169]\n\n\nBooks\nGates has authored four books:\n\n\nPersonal life\nGates is an avid reader, and the ceiling of his large home library is engraved with a quotation from The Great Gatsby [173] [174] He also enjoys bridge, golf, and tennis [175] [176] His days are planned for him on a minute-by-minute basis, similarly to the U.S president's schedule [177] Despite his wealth and extensive business travel, Gates flew coach (economy class) in commercial aircraft until 1997, when he bought a private jet [178]\n\n\nMarriage, family and divorce\nIn 1987, at a trade fair in New York, Gates met Melinda French, a recent graduate of Duke University who had begun working at Microsoft around four months earlier [183] Gates and French became engaged in 1993 after dating for six years [184] They married on January 1, 1994, at the 12th hole of the Jack Nicklaus–designed Manele Golf Course on the Hawaiian Island of Lānaʻi [185] [186] They had three children together: Jennifer Katherine Gates Nassar (born April 26, 1996), Rory John Gates (born May 23, 1999), and Phoebe Adele Gates (born September 14, 2002) [187] [188] The family resided in an earth-sheltered mansion in the side of a hill overlooking Lake Washington in Medina, Washington In 2009, property taxes on the mansion were reported to be US$1.063 million, on a total assessed value of US$147.5 million [189] The 66,000-square-foot (6,100 m2) estate has a 60-foot (18 m) swimming pool with an underwater music system, as well as a 2,500-square-foot (230 m2) gym and a 1,000-square-foot (93 m2) dining room [190]\n\n\nPublic image\nGates's public image has changed over the years At first he was perceived as a brilliant but ruthless \"robber baron\", a \"nerd-turned-tycoon\" [199] Starting in 2000 with the foundation of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and particularly after he stepped down as head of Microsoft, he turned his attention to philanthropy, spending more than $50 billion on causes like health, poverty, and education His image morphed from \"tyrannical technocrat to saintly savior\" to a \"huggable billionaire techno-philanthropist\", celebrated on magazine covers and sought after for his opinions on major issues like global health and climate change [199] Still another shift in public opinion came in 2021 with the announcement that he and Melinda were divorcing Coverage of that proceeding brought out information about romantic pursuits of women who worked for him, a long-term extra-marital affair, and a friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein [200] This information and his response to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in some deterioration of his public image, going from \"a lovable nerd who was out to save the world\" to \"a tech supervillain who wants to protect profits over public health.\" [201]\n\n\nReligious views\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone, Gates said in regard to his faith: \"The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important We've raised our kids in a religious way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world And that's kind of a religious belief I mean, it's at least a moral belief.\" [208] In the same 2014 interview he also said: \"I agree with people like Richard Dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them Now science has filled in some of the realm – not all – that religion used to fill But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view  [laughs] I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know.\" [208]\n\n\nWealth\nIn 1987, Gates was listed as a billionaire in Forbes magazine's first ever America's richest issue; he was the world's youngest-ever self-made billionaire, with a net worth of $1.25 billion Since then, he has been featured on The World's Billionaires list and was ranked as the richest person in 1995, 1996, 1998–2007, and 2009, maintaining the position until 2018, when Jeff Bezos surpassed his wealth Gates was ranked first on the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans from 1993 to 2007, in 2009, and from 2014 to 2017 [209] [210] As of June 2024, [update] he has an estimated net worth of US$154 billion, making him the sixth-richest person in the world according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index [211]\n\n\nControversies\nDuring his tenure as CEO of Microsoft, Gates approved of many decisions that led to antitrust litigation over Microsoft's business practices In the 1998 United States v Microsoft case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive He argued with examiner David Boies over the contextual meaning of words such as \"compete\", \"concerned\", and \"we\" Later in the year, when portions of the videotaped deposition were played back in court, the judge was seen laughing and shaking his head [226] BusinessWeek reported:\n\n\nAntitrust litigation\nDuring his tenure as CEO of Microsoft, Gates approved of many decisions that led to antitrust

David Boies over the contextual meaning of words such as \"compete\", \"concerned\", and \"we\" Later in the year, when portions of the videotaped deposition were played back in court, the judge was seen laughing and shaking his head [226] BusinessWeek reported:\n\n\nTreatment of colleagues and employees\nGates had primary responsibility for Microsoft's product strategy from the company's founding in 1975 until 2006 He gained a reputation for being distant from others; an industry executive complained in 1981 that \"Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls.\" [229] An Atari executive recalled that he showed Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times When they met again a month later, Gates \"won or tied every game He had studied the game until he solved it That is a competitor\" [230]\n\n\nRelationship with Jeffrey Epstein\nA 2019 New York Times article reported that Gates's relationship with financier Jeffrey Epstein started in 2011, just a few years after Epstein was convicted for procuring a child for prostitution, and continued for some years, including a visit to Epstein's house with his wife in the fall of 2013, despite her declared discomfort [243] Gates said in 2011 about Epstein: \"His lifestyle is very different and kind of intriguing although it would not work for me\" [200]\n\n\nRecognition\nGates was the guest on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs on January 31, 2016, in which he talked about his relationships with his father and Steve Jobs, meeting Melinda Ann French, the start of Microsoft and some of his habits (for example reading The Economist \"from cover to cover every week\") His choice of things to take on a desert island were, for music: \"Blue Skies\" by Willie Nelson; a book: The

magnate, software developer, and philanthropist. He is best known as the co-founder of Microsoft Corporation, the world's largest software company. Gates has been a dominant figure in the technology industry for over four decades and has played a significant role in shaping the way people interact with technology.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nWilliam Henry Gates III was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington, as the only son of William H Gates Sr and his first wife, Mary Maxwell Gates. His ancestry includes English, German, and Irish/Scots-Irish. Gates's father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors of First Interstate BancSystem and United Way of America. Gates's maternal grandfather, J W Maxwell, was a national bank president. Gates also has an older sister, Kristi (Kristianne), and a younger sister, Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family but is known as William Gates III or \"Trey\" because his father had the \"II\" suffix. The family lived in the Sand Point area of Seattle in a home that was damaged by a rare tornado when Gates was 7.\n\n**Microsoft**\n\nGates read the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics, which demonstrated the Altair 8800, and contacted Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) to inform them that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform. In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a demonstration, and over the course of a few weeks, they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration was held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, New Mexico; it was a success, and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC. MITS hired Allen, and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with him at MITS in November 1975. Allen named their partnership \"Micro-Soft,\" a combination of \"microcomputer\" and \"software.\" Their first office was in Albuquerque. The first employee Gates and Allen hired was their high school collaborator, Ric Weiland. They dropped the hyphen within a year and officially registered the trade name \"Microsoft\" with the Secretary of the State of New Mexico on November 26, 1976.\n\n**BASIC**\n\nGates read the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics, which demonstrated the Altair 8800, and contacted Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) to inform them that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform.

The first employee Gates and Allen hired was their high school collaborator, Ric Weiland. They dropped the hyphen within a year and officially registered the trade name \"Microsoft\" with the Secretary of the State of New Mexico on November 26, 1976.\n\n**IBM Partnership**\n\nIBM, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time, approached Microsoft in July 1980 concerning software for its upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC, after Gates's mother mentioned Microsoft to John Opel, IBM's then CEO. IBM first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter. IBM's representatives also mentioned that they needed an operating system, and Gates referred them to Digital Research (DRI), makers of the widely used CP/M operating system. IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and asked if Microsoft could provide an operating system. A few weeks later, Gates and Allen proposed using 86-DOS, an operating system similar to CP/M, that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC. Microsoft made a deal with SCP to be the exclusive licensing agent of 86-DOS, and later the full owner. Microsoft employed Paterson to adapt the operating system for the PC and delivered it to IBM as PC DOS for a one-time fee of $50,000.\n\n**Windows**\n\nMicrosoft and Gates launched their first retail version of Microsoft Windows on November 20, 1985, in an attempt to fend off competition from Apple's Macintosh GUI, which had captivated consumers with its simplicity and ease of use. In August 1986, the company struck a deal with IBM to develop a separate operating system called OS/2. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, the partnership deteriorated due to mounting creative differences. The operating system grew out of DOS in an organic fashion over a decade until Windows 95, which hid the DOS prompt by default. Windows XP was released one year after Gates stepped down as Microsoft CEO. Windows 8.1 was the last version of the OS released before Gates left the chair of the firm to John W Thompson on February 5, 2014.\n\n**Management Style**\n\nDuring Microsoft's early years, Gates was an active software developer, particularly in the company's programming language products, but his primary role in most of the company's history was as a manager and executive. He has not officially been on a development team since working on the TRS-80 Model 100. Jerry Pournelle wrote in 1985 when Gates announced Microsoft Excel: \"Bill Gates likes the program, not because it's going to make him a lot of money (although I'm sure it will do that), but because it's a neat hack.\" During the late 1990s, he was criticized for his business tactics, which were considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings.\n\n**Post-Microsoft**\n\nSince leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft, Gates has continued his philanthropy and works on other projects. He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 to become technology advisor at the firm to support newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.\n\n**Business Ventures and Investments**\n\nGates has a multi-billion dollar investment portfolio with stakes in companies in multiple sectors and has participated in several entrepreneurial ventures beyond Microsoft, including climate change and energy. He considers climate change and global access to energy to be critical, interrelated issues. He has urged governments and the private sector to invest in research and development to make clean, reliable energy cheaper. Gates envisions that a breakthrough innovation in sustainable energy technology could drive down both greenhouse gas emissions and poverty, and bring economic benefits by stabilizing energy prices.\n\n**Philanthropy**\n\nGates has studied the work of Andrew Carnegie and John D Rockefeller, and donated some of his Microsoft stock in 1994 to create the \"William H Gates Foundation.\" In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations and donated stock valued at $5 billion to create the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the world's largest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6 billion. The foundation allows benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the Wellcome Trust.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nGates is an avid reader, and the ceiling of his large home library is engraved with a quotation from The Great Gatsby. He also enjoys bridge, golf, and tennis. His days are planned for him on a minute-by-minute basis, similarly to the U.S president's schedule. Despite his wealth and extensive business travel, Gates flew coach (economy class) in commercial aircraft until 1997, when he bought a private jet.\n\n**Marriage, Family and Divorce**\n\nIn 1987, at a trade fair in New York, Gates met Melinda French, a recent graduate of Duke University who had begun working at Microsoft around four months earlier. Gates and French became engaged in 1993 after dating for six years. They married on January 1, 1994, at the 12th hole of the Jack Nicklaus–designed Manele Golf Course on the Hawaiian Island of Lānaʻi. They had three children together: Jennifer Katherine Gates Nassar (born April 26, 1996), Rory John Gates (born May 23, 1999), and Phoebe Adele Gates (born September 14, 2002). The family resided in an earth-sheltered mansion in the side of a hill overlooking Lake Washington in Medina, Washington.\n\n**Public Image**\n\nGates's public image has changed over the years. At first, he was perceived as a brilliant but ruthless \"robber baron,\" a \"nerd-turned-tycoon.\" Starting in 2000 with the foundation of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and particularly after he stepped down as head of Microsoft, he turned his attention to philanthropy, spending more than $50 billion on causes like health, poverty, and education. His image morphed from \"tyrannical technocrat to saintly savior\" to a \"huggable billionaire techno-philanthropist,\" celebrated on magazine covers and sought after for his opinions on major issues like global health and climate change.\n\nStill another shift in public opinion came in 2021 with the announcement that he and Melinda were divorcing. Coverage of that proceeding brought out information about romantic pursuits of women who worked for him, a long-term extra-marital affair, and a friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This information and his response to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in some deterioration of his public image, going from \"a lovable nerd who was out to save the world\" to \"a tech supervillain who wants to protect profits over public health.\"\n\n**Religious Views**\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone, Gates said in regard to his faith: \"The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our kids in a religious way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief.\"\n\n**Wealth**\n\nIn 1987, Gates was listed as a billionaire in Forbes magazine's first ever America's richest issue; he was the world's youngest-ever self-made billionaire, with a net worth of $1.25 billion. Since then, he has been featured on The World's Billionaires list and was ranked as the richest person in 1995, 1996, 1998–2007, and 2009, maintaining the position until 2018, when Jeff Bezos surpassed his wealth. Gates was ranked first on the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans from 1993 to 2007, in 2009, and from 2014 to 2017.\n\nAs of June 2024, Gates has an estimated net worth of $154 billion, making him the sixth-richest person in the world according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nDuring his tenure as CEO of Microsoft, Gates approved of many decisions that led to antitrust litigation over Microsoft's business practices. In the 1998 United States v Microsoft case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner David Boies over the contextual meaning of words such as \"compete,\" \"concerned,\" and \"we.\" Later in the year, when portions of the videotaped deposition were played back in court, the judge was seen laughing and shaking his head.\n\nBusinessWeek reported: \"Gates's testimony in the Microsoft antitrust case has been widely panned as evasive and even perjurious. Gates has a reputation for being a master of spin and a master of the 'gray area.'\"\n\n**Treatment of Colleagues and Employees**\n\nGates had primary responsibility for Microsoft's product strategy from the company's founding in 1975 until 2006. He gained a reputation for being distant from others; an industry executive complained in 1981 that \"Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls.\" An Atari executive recalled that he showed Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times. When they met again a month later, Gates \"won or tied every game. He had studied the game until he solved it. That is a competitor.\"\n\n**Relationship with Jeffrey Epstein**\n\nA 2019 New York Times article reported that Gates's relationship with financier Jeffrey Epstein started in 2011, just a few years after Epstein was convicted for procuring a child for prostitution, and continued for some years, including a visit to Epstein's house with his wife in the fall of 2013, despite her declared discomfort. Gates said in 2011 about Epstein: \"His lifestyle is very different and kind of intriguing although it would not work for me.\"\n\n**Recognition**\n\nGates was the guest on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs on January 31, 2016, in which he talked about his relationships with his father and Steve Jobs, meeting Melinda Ann French, the start of Microsoft and some of his habits (for example reading The Economist \"from cover to cover every week\").

energy thing.\" [107]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nIn October 2024, The New York Times reported Gates had recently donated $50 million to Future Forward USA Action, a 501(c)(4) organization supporting Kamala Harris's 2024 presidential campaign In response to the report, he did not explicitly address the donation or endorse Harris, but said \"this election is different.\" [120]\n\n\nRegulation of the software industry\nIn 1998, Gates rejected the need for regulation of the software industry in testimony before the United States Senate [121] During the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) investigation of Microsoft in the 1990s, Gates was reportedly upset at then Commissioner Dennis Yao for \"float [ing] a line of hypothetical questions suggesting possible curbs on Microsoft's growing monopoly power\" According to one source:\n\n\nDonald Trump Facebook ban\nAfter Facebook and Twitter had banned Donald Trump from their platforms on February 18, 2021, as a result of the 2020 United States presidential election which led to the January 6 United States Capitol attack, Gates said a permanent ban of Trump \"would be a shame\" and would be an \"extreme measure\" He warned that it would cause \"polarization\" if users with different political views divide up among various social networks, and said: \"I don't think banning somebody who actually did get a fair number of votes (in the presidential election) – well less than a majority – but I don't think having him off forever would be that good.\" [121]\n\n\nPatents for COVID-19 vaccines\nIn April 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Gates was criticized for suggesting that pharmaceutical companies should hold onto patents for COVID-19 vaccines The criticism came due to the possibility of this preventing poorer nations from obtaining adequate vaccines Tara Van Ho of the University of Essex stated, \"Gates speaks as if all the lives being lost in India are inevitable but eventually the West will help when in reality the US & UK are holding their feet on the neck of developing states by refusing to break  [intellectual property rights] protections It's disgusting.\" [123]\n\n\nCryptocurrencies\nGates has been critical of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin According to him, cryptocurrencies provide no \"valuable output\", contribute nothing to society, and pose a danger especially for smaller investors who could not survive the potentially high losses Gates also does not own any cryptocurrencies himself [128]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nGates studied the work of Andrew Carnegie and John D Rockefeller, and donated some of his Microsoft stock in 1994 to create the \"William H Gates Foundation\" In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations and donated stock valued at $5 billion to create the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the world's largest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6 billion [129] [130] The foundation allows benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the Wellcome Trust [131] [132] Gates, through his

sold their home and gave away half of its value, as detailed in their book, The Power of Half [144] Gates and his wife invited Joan Salwen to Seattle to speak about what the family had done, and on December 9, 2010, Bill and Melinda Gates and investor Warren Buffett each signed a commitment they called the \"Giving Pledge\", which is a commitment by all three to donate at least half of their wealth, over the course of time, to charity [145] [146] [147] The Foundation has received criticism, particularly over its role in Common Core, with critics stating the support is \"cronyist\" in that it profits from the \"federal, state, and local contracts.\" [148] [149] [150] [151]\n\n\nCharity sports events\nIn April 2017, Gates partnered with Swiss tennis player Roger Federer in playing in the Match for Africa 4, a noncompetitive tennis match at a sold-out Key Arena in Seattle The event was in support of the Roger Federer Foundation's charity efforts in Africa [167] Federer and Gates played against John Isner, the top-ranked American player for much of this decade, and Mike McCready, the lead guitarist for Pearl Jam The pair won the match 6 games to 4 Overall, they raised $2 million for children in Africa [168] The following year, Gates and Federer returned to play in the Match for Africa 5 on March 5, 2018, at San Jose's SAP Center Their opponents were Jack Sock, one of the top American players and a grand slam winner in doubles, and Savannah Guthrie, a co-anchor for NBC's Today show Gates and Federer recorded their second match victory together by a score of 6–3 and the

Jennifer Katherine Gates Nassar (born April 26, 1996), Rory John Gates (born May 23, 1999), and Phoebe Adele Gates (born September 14, 2002) [187] [188] The family resided in an earth-sheltered mansion in the side of a hill overlooking Lake Washington in Medina, Washington In 2009, property taxes on the mansion were reported to be US$1.063 million, on a total assessed value of US$147.5 million [189] The 66,000-square-foot (6,100 m2) estate has a 60-foot (18 m) swimming pool with an underwater music system, as well as a 2,500-square-foot (230 m2) gym and a 1,000-square-foot (93 m2) dining room [190]\n\n\nPublic image\nGates's public image has changed over the years At first he was perceived as a brilliant but ruthless \"robber baron\", a \"nerd-turned-tycoon\" [199] Starting in 2000 with the foundation of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and particularly after he stepped down as head of Microsoft, he turned his attention to philanthropy, spending more than $50 billion on causes like health, poverty, and education His image morphed from \"tyrannical technocrat to saintly savior\" to a \"huggable billionaire techno-philanthropist\", celebrated on magazine covers and sought after for his opinions on major issues like global health and climate change [199] Still another shift in public opinion came in 2021 with the announcement that he and Melinda were divorcing Coverage of that proceeding brought out information about romantic pursuits of women who worked for him, a long-term extra-marital affair, and a friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein [200] This information and his response to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in some deterioration of his public image, going from \"a lovable nerd who was out to save the world\" to \"a tech supervillain who wants to protect profits over public health.\" [201]\n\n\nReligious views\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone, Gates said in regard to his faith: \"The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important We've raised our kids in a religious way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world And that's kind of a religious belief I mean, it's at least a moral belief.\" [208] In the same 2014 interview he also said: \"I agree with people like Richard Dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them Now science has filled in some of the realm – not all – that religion used to fill But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view  [laughs] I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know.\" [208]\n\n\nWealth\nIn 1987, Gates was listed as a billionaire in Forbes magazine's first ever America's richest issue; he was the world's youngest-ever self-made billionaire, with a net worth of $1.25 billion Since then, he has been featured on The World's Billionaires list and was ranked as the richest person in 1995, 1996, 1998–2007, and 2009, maintaining the position until 2018, when Jeff Bezos surpassed his wealth Gates was ranked first on the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans from 1993 to 2007, in 2009, and from 2014 to 2017 [209] [210] As of June 2024, [update] he has an estimated net worth of US$154 billion, making him the sixth-richest person in the world according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index [211]\n\n\nControversies\nDuring his tenure as CEO of Microsoft, Gates approved of many decisions that led to antitrust litigation over Microsoft's business practices In the 1998 United States v Microsoft case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive He argued with examiner David Boies over the contextual meaning of words such as \"compete\", \"concerned\", and \"we\" Later in the year, when portions of the videotaped deposition were played back in court, the judge was seen laughing and shaking his head [226] BusinessWeek reported:\n\n\nAntitrust litigation\nDuring his tenure as CEO of Microsoft, Gates approved of many decisions that led to antitrust litigation over Microsoft's business practices In the 1998 United

\"concerned\", and \"we\" Later in the year, when portions of the videotaped deposition were played back in court, the judge was seen laughing and shaking his head [226] BusinessWeek reported:\n\n\nTreatment of colleagues and employees\nGates had primary responsibility for Microsoft's product strategy from the company's founding in 1975 until 2006 He gained a reputation for being distant from others; an industry executive complained in 1981 that \"Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls.\" [229] An Atari executive recalled that he showed Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times When they met again a month later, Gates \"won or tied every game He had studied the game until he solved it That is a competitor\" [230]\n\n\nRelationship with Jeffrey Epstein\nA 2019 New York Times article reported that Gates's relationship with financier Jeffrey Epstein started in 2011, just a few years after Epstein was convicted for procuring a child for prostitution, and continued for some years, including a visit to Epstein's house with his wife in the fall of 2013, despite her declared discomfort [243] Gates said in 2011 about Epstein: \"His lifestyle is very different and kind of intriguing although it would not work for me\" [200]\n\n\nRecognition\nGates was the guest on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs on January 31, 2016, in which he talked about his relationships with his father and Steve Jobs, meeting Melinda Ann French, the start of Microsoft and some of his habits (for example reading The Economist \"from cover to cover every week\") His choice of things to take on a desert island were, for music: \"Blue Skies\" by Willie Nelson; a book: The Better Angels of Our Nature by Steven

Websites can be accessed via a web browser and may provide features such as online interactive tools, social networking services, and e-commerce facilities.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe World Wide Web (WWW) was created in 1989 by the British CERN computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to use for anyone, contributing to the immense growth of the Web. The introduction of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) enabled users to access and share information across the internet. Today, websites are an integral part of modern life, providing a wide range of services, from news and entertainment to education and e-commerce.\n\n**Background**\n\nBefore the introduction of the World Wide Web, other protocols such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and the gopher protocol were used to retrieve individual files from a server. These protocols offered a simple directory structure in which the user navigated and chose files to download. Documents were most often presented as plain text files without formatting or were encoded in word processor formats. The introduction of the World Wide Web revolutionized the way people accessed and shared information, enabling the creation of complex and dynamic websites.\n\n**History**\n\nThe original spelling of \"web site\" was widely used, but over time, the variant \"website\" has become the standard spelling. This change has been reflected in major style guides, including The Chicago Manual of Style and the AP Stylebook. The shift towards \"website\" has been driven by the increasing complexity and diversity of online content, which has led to a greater need for clarity and consistency in terminology.\n\n**Static Website**\n\nA static website is one that has web pages stored on the server in the format that is sent to a client web browser. It is primarily coded in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) used to control appearance beyond basic HTML. Images are commonly used to create the desired appearance and as part of the main content. Audio or video might also be considered \"static\" content if it plays automatically or is generally non-interactive. This type of website usually displays the same information to all visitors, similar to handing out a printed brochure to customers or clients. Although the website owner may make updates periodically, it is a manual process to edit the text, photos, and other content, which may require basic website design skills and software.\n\n**Dynamic Website**\n\nA dynamic website is one that changes or customizes itself frequently and automatically. Server-side dynamic pages are generated \"on the fly\" by computer code that produces the HTML. CSS are responsible for appearance and thus, are static files. There are a wide range of software systems, such as CGI, Java Servlets and Java Server Pages (JSP), Active Server Pages and ColdFusion (CFML), that are available to generate dynamic Web systems and dynamic sites. Various Web application frameworks and Web template systems are available for general-use programming languages like Perl, PHP, Python, and Ruby to make it faster and easier to create complex dynamic websites.\n\n**Multimedia and Interactive Content**\n\nEarly websites had only text, and soon after, images. Web browser plug-ins were then used to add audio, video, and interactivity (such as for a rich Web application that mirrors the complexity of a desktop application like a word processor). Examples of such plug-ins are Microsoft Silverlight, Adobe Flash Player, Adobe Shockwave Player, and Java SE. HTML 5 includes provisions for audio and video without plugins. JavaScript is also built into most modern web browsers, and allows for website creators to send code to the web browser that instructs it how to interactively modify page content and communicate with the web server if needed. The browser's internal representation of the content is known as the Document Object Model (DOM).\n\n**Types**\n\nWebsites can be divided into two broad categories—static and interactive. Interactive sites are part of the Web 2.0 community of sites and allow for interactivity between the site owner and site visitors or users. Static sites serve or capture information but do not allow engagement with the audience or users directly. Some websites are informational or produced by enthusiasts or for personal use or entertainment. Many websites do aim to make money using one or more business models, including e-commerce, advertising, and subscription-based services.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWebsites have become an integral part of modern life, providing a wide range of services and features. From static websites that provide information to dynamic websites that interact with users, the diversity of online content has led to a greater need for clarity and consistency in terminology. As the web continues to evolve, it is likely that websites will become even more complex and interactive, providing new and innovative ways for people to access and share information.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Website\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nThe World Wide Web (WWW) was created in 1989 by the British CERN computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee [1] [2] On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to use for anyone, contributing to the immense growth of the Web [3] Before the introduction of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), other protocols such as File Transfer Protocol and the gopher protocol were used to retrieve individual files from a server These protocols offer a simple directory structure in which the user navigates and where they choose files to download Documents were most often presented as plain text files without formatting or were encoded in word processor formats.\n\n\nHistory\nWhile \"web site\" was the original spelling (sometimes capitalized \"Web site\", since \"Web\" is a proper noun when referring to the World Wide Web), this variant has become rarely used, and \"website\" has become the standard spelling All major style guides, such as The Chicago Manual of Style [4] and the AP Stylebook, [5] have reflected this change.\n\n\nStatic website\nA static website is one that has Web pages stored on the server in the format that is sent to a client Web browser It is primarily coded in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML); Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to control appearance beyond basic HTML Images are commonly used to create the desired appearance and as part of the main content Audio or video might also be considered \"static\" content if it plays automatically or is generally non-interactive This type of website usually displays the same information to all visitors Similar to handing out a printed brochure to customers or clients, a static website will generally provide consistent, standard information for an extended period of time Although the website owner may make updates periodically, it is a manual process to edit the text, photos, and other content and may require basic website design skills and software Simple forms or marketing examples of websites, such as a classic website, a five-page website or a brochure website are often static websites, because they present pre-defined, static information to the user This may include information about a company and its products and services through text, photos, animations, audio/video, and navigation menus.\n\n\nDynamic website\nA dynamic website is one that changes or customizes itself frequently and automatically Server-side dynamic pages are generated \"on the fly\" by computer code that produces the HTML (CSS are responsible for appearance and thus, are static files) There are a wide range of software systems, such as CGI, Java Servlets and Java Server Pages (JSP), Active Server Pages and ColdFusion (CFML) that are available to generate dynamic Web systems and dynamic sites Various Web application frameworks and Web template systems are available for general-use programming languages like Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby to make it faster and easier to create complex dynamic websites.\n\n\nMultimedia and interactive content\nEarly websites had only text, and soon after, images Web browser plug-ins were then used to add audio, video, and interactivity (such as for a rich Web application that mirrors the complexity of a desktop application like a word processor) Examples of such plug-ins are Microsoft Silverlight, Adobe Flash Player, Adobe Shockwave Player, and Java SE HTML 5 includes provisions for audio and video without plugins JavaScript is also built into most modern web browsers, and allows for website creators to send code to the web browser that instructs it how to interactively modify page content and communicate with the web server if needed The browser's internal representation of the content is known as the Document Object Model (DOM).\n\n\nTypes\nWebsites can be divided into two broad categories—static and interactive Interactive sites are part of the Web 2.0 community of sites and allow for interactivity between the site owner and site visitors or users Static sites serve or capture information but do not allow engagement with the audience or users directly Some websites are informational or produced by enthusiasts or for personal use or entertainment Many websites do aim to make money using one or more business models, including:\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

de-regionalised into a third and fourth division for the 1958–1959 season Albion retained their second tier status until relegation in 1962, suffering a successive relegation in 1963 and slipping into the fourth division for the first time They won the fourth division title in 1964–1965 and remained in the third division until 1972 when as runners up they secured promotion back to the second division.\n\n\nFormation and early years (1901–1972)\nBrighton & Hove Albion F.C were founded in 1901 and 19 years later, in 1920, they were elected to the Football League's new Third Division – having previously been members of the Southern League In the Southern League they won their only national honour to date, the FA Charity Shield, which at that time was contested by the champions of

for the first time They won the fourth division title in 1964–1965 and remained in the third division until 1972 when as runners up they secured promotion back to the second division.\n\n\nMike Bamber years (1972–1987)\nMike Bamber was the chairman of Brighton from October 1972 until 1983 He famously brought Brian Clough to the club in 1973 and later appointed former England player Alan Mullery as manager Brighton's life as a Football League club had brought little in the way of success and headlines until 1979, when, under Mullery's management, they were promoted to the First Division as Second Division runners-up The 1982/83 season saw a wildly inconsistent start for the club, with victories over Arsenal and Manchester United mixed in with heavy defeats Manager Mike Bailey eventually lost his job at the start of December 1982 Jimmy Melia took over as manager, but was unable to turn the situation around and Brighton, after four seasons in the top flight, were relegated in 1983, finishing in last place.\n\n\nRelegation, last years, and saved by Knight (1987–1997)\nAfter four seasons, relegation to Division Three came in 1987, but the Albion were promoted back the next season In 1991 they lost the play-off final at Wembley to Notts County 3–1, only to be relegated the next season to the newly named Division Two In 1996 further relegation came to Division Three The club's financial situation was becoming increasingly precarious, and the club's directors decided that the Goldstone Ground would have to be sold to pay off some of the club's large debts Manager Jimmy Case was sacked, after a very poor start to the 1996–97 season left Brighton at the bottom of the league by a considerable margin The club's directors appointed Steve Gritt, the former joint manager of Charlton Athletic, as manager—Gritt was relatively unknown Brighton's league performance steadily improved under Gritt, although their improving chances of survival were put under further threat by a two-point deduction by the Football Association, imposed as punishment for a pitch invasion by fans who were protesting against the sale of the Goldstone ground A lifelong fan named Dick Knight took control of the club in 1997 having led the fan pressure to oust the previous board following their sale of the club's Goldstone Ground to property developers [4]\n\n\nWithdean era and Bloom takeover (1997–2011)\nThe sale of the Goldstone Ground went through in 1997, leading to Brighton having to play some 70 miles away at Gillingham's Priestfield stadium for two seasons Micky Adams was appointed Brighton's manager in 1999 For the start of the 1999–2000 season the Seagulls secured a lease to play home games at Withdean Stadium, a converted athletics track in Brighton owned by the local council 2000–01 was Brighton's first successful season for 13 years They were crowned champions of Division Three and promoted to Division Two Adams left in October 2001 to work as Dave Bassett's assistant at Leicester, being replaced by former Leicester manager Peter Taylor The transition proved to be a plus point for Brighton, who maintained their good form and ended the season as Division Two champions – winning a second successive promotion Just five years after almost succumbing to the double threat of losing their Football League status and going out of business completely, Brighton were one division away from the Premier League.\n\n\nMove to new stadium and promotion under Hughton (2011–2017)\nThe Falmer Stadium hosted its first league match on the opening day of the 2011–12 season against Doncaster Rovers, who were the last opposition to play at the Goldstone in 1997 The game finished 2–1 to Brighton The 2012–13 season saw Brighton finish 4th and lose in the play-off

[37] In addition, the A23 road runs directly between Brighton and Croydon, where Palace's Selhurst Park stadium is based This has led to the media labelling the rivalry as both the A23 and M23 derby,

The club was founded in 1901 and has a rich history in English football, with a strong following and a reputation for producing talented players.\n\n**History**\n\nBrighton & Hove Albion F.C. were founded in 1901 and 19 years later, in 1920, they were elected to the Football League's new Third Division – having previously been members of the Southern League. In the Southern League, they won their only national honour to date, the FA Charity Shield, which at that time was contested by the champions of the Southern League, and the Football League, by defeating Football League Champions Aston Villa in 1910.\n\nFollowing their switch to the regionalised division three south in 1921, they remained in this division until the 1957–1958 season, when they won the title and secured promotion to the Second Division at the same time as the regionalised north and south divisions de-regionalised into a third and fourth division for the 1958–1959 season.\n\nAlbion retained their second-tier status until relegation in 1962, suffering a successive relegation in 1963 and slipping into the fourth division for the first time. They won the fourth division title in 1964–1965 and remained in the third division until 1972 when, as runners-up, they secured promotion back to the second division.\n\n**Formation and Early Years (1901–1972)**\n\nBrighton & Hove Albion F.C. were founded in 1901 and 19 years later, in 1920, they were elected to the Football League's new Third Division – having previously been members of the Southern League. In the Southern League, they won their only national honour to date, the FA Charity Shield, which at that time was contested by the champions of the Southern League, and the Football League, by defeating Football League Champions Aston Villa in 1910.\n\nFollowing their switch to the regionalised division three south in 1921, they remained in this division until the 1957–1958 season, when they won the title and secured promotion to the Second Division at the same time as the regionalised north and south divisions de-regionalised into a third and fourth division for the 1958–1959 season.\n\nAlbion retained their second-tier status until relegation in 1962, suffering a successive relegation in 1963 and slipping into the fourth division for the first time. They won the fourth division title in 1964–1965 and remained in the third division until 1972 when, as runners-up, they secured promotion back to the second division.\n\n**Mike Bamber Years (1972–1987)**\n\nMike Bamber was the chairman of Brighton from October 1972 until 1983. He famously brought Brian Clough to the club in 1973 and later appointed former England player Alan Mullery as manager. Brighton's life as a Football League club had brought little in the way of success and headlines until 1979, when, under Mullery's management, they were promoted to the First Division as Second Division runners-up.\n\nThe 1982/83 season saw a wildly inconsistent start for the club, with victories over Arsenal and Manchester United mixed in with heavy defeats. Manager Mike Bailey eventually lost his job at the start of December 1982. Jimmy Melia took over as manager, but was unable to turn the situation around and Brighton, after four seasons in the top flight, were relegated in 1983, finishing in last place.\n\n**Relegation, Last Years, and Saved by Knight (1987–1997)**\n\nAfter four seasons, relegation to Division Three came in 1987, but the Albion were promoted back the next season. In 1991 they lost the play-off final at Wembley to Notts County 3–1, only to be relegated the next season to the newly named Division Two.\n\nIn 1996, further relegation came to Division Three. The club's financial situation was becoming increasingly precarious, and the club's directors decided that the Goldstone Ground would have to be sold to pay off some of the club's large debts. Manager Jimmy Case was sacked, after a very poor start to the 1996–97 season left Brighton at the bottom of the league by a considerable margin.\n\nThe club's directors appointed Steve Gritt, the former joint manager of Charlton Athletic, as manager—Gritt was relatively unknown. Brighton's league performance steadily improved under Gritt, although their improving chances of survival were put under further threat by a two-point deduction by the Football Association, imposed as punishment for a pitch invasion by fans who were protesting against the sale of the Goldstone ground.\n\nA lifelong fan named Dick Knight took control of the club in 1997, having led the fan pressure to oust the previous board following their sale of the club's Goldstone Ground to property developers.\n\n**Withdean Era and Bloom Takeover (1997–2011)**\n\nThe sale of the Goldstone Ground went through in 1997, leading to Brighton having to play some 70 miles away at Gillingham's Priestfield stadium for two seasons. Micky Adams was appointed Brighton's manager in 1999.\n\nFor the start of the 1999–2000 season, the Seagulls secured a lease to play home games at Withdean Stadium, a converted athletics track in Brighton owned by the local council. 2000–01 was Brighton's first successful season for 13 years. They were crowned champions of Division Three and promoted to Division Two.\n\nAdams left in October 2001 to work as Dave Bassett's assistant at Leicester, being replaced by former Leicester manager Peter Taylor. The transition proved to be a plus point for Brighton, who maintained their good form and ended the season as Division Two champions – winning a second successive promotion.\n\nJust five years after almost succumbing to the double threat of losing their Football League status and going out of business completely, Brighton were one division away from the Premier League.\n\n**Move to New Stadium (2011–present)**\n\nThe Falmer Stadium hosted its first league match on the opening day of the 2011–12 season against Doncaster Rovers, who were the last opposition to play at the Goldstone in 1997. The game finished 2–1 to Brighton.\n\nThe 2012–13 season saw Brighton finish 4th and lose in the play-off semi-finals to Crystal Palace. Poyet was suspended as manager following controversial comments made in his post-match interview, and was later sacked as manager and replaced by Óscar García.\n\n**Back in the Top Division (2017–present)**\n\nBrighton's first season in the Premier League was largely successful, with the club rising into the top half several times in the season.

He was born on June 28, 1932, in Isleton, California, to Japanese immigrant parents. Morita's father, Tamaru, immigrated to California from Kumamoto Prefecture on the Japanese island of Kyushu in 1915, and his mother, Momoe, immigrated to California in 1913.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nMorita was born as Noriyuki Morita, and he had a brother named Hideo (Harry) who was twelve years older. Morita's early life was marked by hardship, as his family struggled to make a living in the United States. Despite these challenges, Morita's parents instilled in him a strong sense of discipline and work ethic, which would serve him well in his later years.\n\n**Television and Movie Career**\n\nMorita's acting career began in the 1960s, with small roles in films such as Thoroughly Modern Millie (1967) and The Shakiest Gun in the West (1968). He also appeared in various television shows, including Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In (1968 Season 1 Episode 8). Morita's breakthrough role came in the 1970s, when he played the recurring character of Ah Chew on the sitcom Sanford and Son (1974-1976).\n\nMorita's next major role was as South Korean Army Captain Sam Pak on the sitcom M*A*S*H (1973, 1974).

He went from being a relatively unknown actor to a household name, thanks to his charismatic performance on the show.\n\n**The Karate Kid Film Series**\n\nMorita's most iconic role was, of course, Mr. Miyagi in the Karate Kid film series. He was initially rejected for the part due to his association with stand-up comedy and his role on Happy Days. However, after auditioning five times, Morita won the role, partly due to his unique accent and beard.\n\nMorita's performance as Mr. Miyagi earned him widespread acclaim, and he became synonymous with the character. His chemistry with co-star Ralph Macchio was undeniable, and the two actors formed a lasting bond.\n\n**Television Series**\n\nIn addition to his film work, Morita also starred in several television series. In 1976, he starred in his own show, Mr. T and Tina, the first Asian-American sitcom on network TV. The show was placed on Saturday nights by ABC and was quickly canceled after a month.\n\nMorita also starred in the ABC detective show Ohara (1987-1988), which was canceled after two seasons due to poor ratings. Despite these setbacks, Morita remained committed to his craft, and he continued to take on challenging roles throughout his career.\n\n**Later Work**\n\nIn the 1990s, Morita continued to work in film and television, taking on a range of roles. He appeared in the Kirk Douglas-starring television movie Amos, playing the role of Tommy Tanaka. Morita's performance earned him a Primetime Emmy Award nomination and a Golden Globe Award nomination.\n\n**Death**\n\nPat Morita passed away on November 24, 2005, at the age of 73, due to kidney failure, following a urinary tract and gallbladder bacterial infection. Throughout his life, Morita had battled alcoholism, and his passing was a shock to the entertainment industry.\n\nMorita was cremated at Palm Green Valley Mortuary and Cemetery in Las Vegas, Nevada. His legacy as a beloved actor and comedian continues to endure, and his iconic performance as Mr. Miyagi remains one of the most memorable in film history.\n\n**Posthumous Credits**\n\nIn the years following his passing, Morita's legacy has continued to grow. He has been remembered and honored in various ways, including a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nMorita's impact on the entertainment industry cannot be overstated. He paved the way for future generations of Asian-American actors and comedians, and his performances continue to inspire and entertain audiences around the world.\n\nIn conclusion, Pat Morita was a true Hollywood legend, and his contributions to the entertainment industry will never be forgotten. His legacy as a talented actor, comedian, and mentor will continue to inspire and entertain audiences for generations to come.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Pat_Morita\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nMorita was born on June 28, 1932, in Isleton, California, to Japanese immigrant parents [5] Morita's father, Tamaru, born in 1897, immigrated to California from Kumamoto Prefecture on the Japanese island of Kyushu in 1915 [6] Tamaru's wife, Momoe, born in 1903, immigrated to California in 1913 [7] Noriyuki, as Pat was named, had a brother named Hideo (Harry) who was twelve years older [8] [9]\n\n\nTelevision and movie career\nMorita's first movie roles were as a henchman in Thoroughly Modern Millie (1967) and a similar role in The Shakiest Gun in the West (1968), starring Don Knotts Rowan and Martin's Laugh In (1968 Season 1 Episode 8) Morita had appearances in different skits on the show Morita had other notable recurring television roles on Sanford and Son (1974–1976) as Ah Chew, a good-natured friend of Lamont Sanford, and as South Korean Army Captain Sam Pak on the sitcom M*A*S*H (1973, 1974) [20] He was also cast as Rear Admiral Ryunosuke Kusaka in the war film Midway (1976).\n\n\nEarly work\nMorita's first movie roles were as a henchman in Thoroughly Modern Millie (1967) and a similar role in The Shakiest Gun in the West (1968), starring Don Knotts Rowan and Martin's Laugh In (1968 Season 1 Episode 8) Morita had appearances in different skits on the show Morita had other notable recurring television roles on Sanford and Son (1974–1976) as Ah Chew, a good-natured friend of Lamont Sanford, and as South Korean Army Captain Sam Pak on the sitcom M*A*S*H (1973, 1974) [20] He was also cast as Rear Admiral Ryunosuke Kusaka in the war film Midway (1976).\n\n\nHappy Days\nMorita had a recurring role in the mid-1970's on Happy Days as Matsuo \"Arnold\" Takahashi (the new Japanese owner of Arnold's Drive-In) commencing in season three (1975–76) The story line was that Takahashi had purchased the Milwaukee eatery from the original Arnold but adopted the former's first name, explaining that it was too expensive for him to purchase the additional neon sign letters required to rename it \"Takahashi's\" As the new owner, he moonlighted as a martial arts instructor, teaching self-defense classes at the drive-in after hours Morita also portrayed \"Arnold\" as a guest star during seasons four and six before returning as a recurring character for season ten and as a main character in the final eleventh season He also portrayed the character of Arnold on Blansky's Beauties in 1977.\n\n\nThe Karate Kid film series\nMorita gained particular fame during the 1980s for his work as Mr Miyagi in the Karate Kid films The original preferred choice was Toshiro Mifune, who had appeared in the Akira Kurosawa films Rashomon (1950), Seven Samurai (1954), and The Hidden Fortress (1958), but the actor did not speak English [21] Morita later auditioned for the role, but was initially rejected for the part due to his close association with stand-up comedy, and with the character Arnold from Happy Days [21] Producer Jerry Weintraub in particular did not want Morita, as he saw him as a comedic actor [22] Morita eventually tested five times before Weintraub himself offered him the role, [22] ultimately winning it because he grew a beard and patterned his accent after his uncle [23] After he was cast and although he had been using the name Pat for years, Weintraub suggested that he be billed with his given name to sound \"more ethnic\" [24]\n\n\nTelevision series\nMorita was the star of two television series In 1976, he starred as inventor Taro Takahashi in his own show, Mr T and Tina, the first Asian-American sitcom on network TV The sitcom was placed on Saturday nights by ABC and was quickly canceled after a month in the fall of 1976 He also starred in the ABC detective show Ohara (1987–1988); it was cancelled after two seasons due to poor ratings.\n\n\nLater work\nMorita went on to play Tommy Tanaka in the Kirk Douglas-starring television movie Amos, receiving his first Primetime Emmy Award nomination and second Golden Globe Award nomination for the role.\n\n\nDeath\nPat Morita died of kidney failure, following a urinary tract and gallbladder bacterial infection, on November 24, 2005, at his home in Las Vegas, Nevada, at the age of 73 Throughout his life, Morita had battled alcoholism [29] [20] [30]\nHe was cremated at Palm Green Valley Mortuary and Cemetery in Las Vegas, Nevada [31]\n\n\nPosthumous credits\n\n\nFilmography\nSeason 2, Episode 19, \"The Chosen People\".\n\n\nPosthumous credits\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

in 1924 His father-in-law's past as Viceroy of India allowed for the acquaintance of various personalities along the journey They travelled by ship and stopped briefly in Cairo [19]\n\n\nMarriage to Diana Mitford\nCynthia died of peritonitis in 1933, after which Mosley married his mistress Diana Guinness, née Mitford (1910–2003) They married in secret in Nazi Germany on 6 October 1936 in the Berlin home of Germany's Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda Joseph Goebbels Adolf Hitler was their guest of honour [20]\n\n\nMember of parliament\nBy the end of the First World War, Mosley had decided to go into politics as a Conservative member of parliament, as he had no university education or practical experience because of the war He was 21 years old He was driven by, and in parliament spoke of, a passionate conviction to avoid any future war, and this seemingly motivated his career Largely because of his family background and war service, local Conservative and Labour associations preferred Mosley in several constituencies—a vacancy near the family estates seemed to be the best prospect He was unexpectedly selected for Harrow first In the general election of 1918 he faced no serious opposition and was elected easily [22]\n\n\nCrossing the floor\nMosley was at this time falling out with the Conservatives over their Irish policy, and condemned the operations of the Black and Tans against civilians during the Irish War of Independence [25] He was secretary of the Peace with Ireland Council [26] As secretary of the council, he proposed sending a commission to Ireland to examine on-the-spot reprisals by the Black and Tans [27]\n\n\nOffice\nMosley then made a bold bid for political advancement within the Labour Party He was close to Ramsay MacDonald and hoped for one of the Great Offices of State, but when Labour won the 1929 general election he was appointed only to the post of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, a position without portfolio and outside the Cabinet He was given responsibility for solving the unemployment problem, but found that his radical proposals were blocked either by Lord Privy Seal James Henry Thomas or by the cabinet.\n\n\nChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster\nMosley then made a bold bid for political advancement within the Labour Party He was close to Ramsay MacDonald and hoped for one of the Great

given responsibility for solving the unemployment problem, but found that his radical proposals were blocked either by Lord Privy Seal James Henry Thomas or by the cabinet.\n\n\nMosley Memorandum\nRealising the economic uncertainty that was facing the nation because of the death of its domestic industry, Mosley put forward a scheme in the \"Mosley Memorandum\" that called for high tariffs to protect British industries from international finance and transform the British Empire into an autarkic trading bloc, for state nationalisation of main industries, for higher school-leaving ages and pensions to reduce the labour surplus, and for a programme of public works to solve interwar poverty and unemployment Furthermore, the memorandum laid out the foundations of the corporate state which intended to combine businesses, workers and the government into one body as a way to \"Obliterate class conflict and make the British economy healthy again\" [34]\n\n\nNew Party\nDissatisfied with the Labour Party, Mosley and six other Labour MPs (two of whom resigned after one day) founded the New Party.\n\n\nFascism\nAfter his election failure in 1931, Mosley went on a study tour of the \"new movements\" of Italy's Benito Mussolini and other fascists, and returned convinced, particularly by Fascist Italy's economic programme, [43] that it was the way forward for Britain He was determined to unite the existing fascist movements and created the British Union of Fascists (BUF) in 1932 The BUF was protectionist, strongly anti-communist and nationalistic to the point of advocating authoritarianism [44] He claimed that the UK Labour Party was pursuing policies of \"international socialism\", while fascism's aim was \"national socialism\" [45] It claimed membership as high as 50,000, and had the Daily Mail and Daily Mirror among its earliest supporters [42] [46] The Mirror piece was a guest article by the Daily Mail owner Viscount Rothermere and an apparent one-off; despite these briefly warm words for the BUF, the paper was so vitriolic in its condemnation of European fascism that Nazi Germany added the paper's directors to a hit list in the event of a successful Operation Sea Lion [47] The Mail continued to support the BUF until the Olympia rally in June 1934 [48]\n\n\nInternment\nUnbeknown to Mosley, MI5 and the Special Branch had deeply penetrated the BUF and were also monitoring him through listening devices Beginning in 1934, they were increasingly worried that Mosley's noted oratory skills would convince the public to provide financial support to the BUF, enabling it to challenge the political establishment [55] His agitation was officially tolerated until the events of the Battle of France in May 1940 made the government consider him too dangerous Mosley, who at that time was focused on pleading for the British to accept Hitler's peace offer of October 1939, was detained on 23 May 1940, less than a fortnight after Winston Churchill became prime minister [1] Mosley was interrogated for 16 hours by Lord Birkett [55] but never formally charged with a crime, and was instead interned under Defence Regulation 18B Most other active fascists in Britain met the same fate, resulting in the BUF's practical removal at an organised level from the United Kingdom's political stage [1] Mosley's wife, Diana, was also interned in June, [56] shortly after the birth of their son (Max Mosley); the Mosleys lived together for most of the war in a house in the grounds of Holloway prison The BUF was proscribed by the British government later that year.\n\n\nPost-war politics\nAfter the Second World War, Mosley was contacted by former supporters and persuaded to return to participation in politics In 1948 he formed the Union Movement, which called for a single nation-state to cover the continent of Europe (known as Europe a Nation) and in 1962 attempted to launch a National Party of Europe to this end He had connections with the Italian neo-fascist political party, Movimento Sociale Italiano, and contributed to a weekly Roman magazine, Asso di bastoni (Ace of Clubs, published from 1948 to 1957), which was supported by his Europe a Nation [61] The New European has described Mosley as an \"avowed Europhile\" [62] The Union Movement's meetings were often physically disrupted, as Mosley's meetings had been before the war, and largely by the same opponents This may have contributed to his decision, in 1951, to leave Britain and live in Ireland [63] He responded to criticism of his abandoning his supporters in a hostile Britain for a life abroad by saying, \"You don't clear up a dungheap from underneath it.\" [64] In the 1950s Mosley advocated that Africa be divided into black and white areas, [65] but the decolonisation of the 1960s put an end to this proposal [66] [page needed]\n\n\nPersonal life\nMosley had three children with his first wife Lady Cynthia Curzon

He was born on November 16, 1896, in London, England, and died on December 3, 1980, in Orsay, France.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nOswald Mosley was a complex figure who played a significant role in British politics during the 20th century. He was a member of the aristocracy and a decorated war hero who served in World War I. Mosley was also a charismatic leader who founded the British Union of Fascists (BUF) and became a prominent figure in the fascist movement in the United Kingdom. However, his politics and ideology were highly controversial, and he was eventually interned during World War II for his perceived threat to national security.\n\n**Life and Career**\n\nMosley was born on November 16, 1896, at 47 Hill Street, Mayfair, London, to Sir Oswald Mosley, 5th Baronet, and Katharine Maud Edwards-Heathcote. He was the eldest of three sons, and his family was part of the British aristocracy. Mosley's father was a third cousin to the 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, father of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nMosley was educated at St. Aubyn's School in Rottingdean, East Sussex, and later at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. However, he was expelled from Sandhurst in June 1914 for a \"riotous act of retaliation\" against a fellow student. Mosley's military service during World War I was marked by bravery and recklessness, and he was decorated for his actions on the Western Front.\n\n**Marriage to Lady Cynthia Curzon**\n\nOn May 11, 1920, Mosley married Lady Cynthia \"Cimmie\" Curzon, the second daughter of the 1st Earl Curzon of Kedleston. The marriage was a high-society event, and Mosley's wife was a member of the British aristocracy. The couple had three children together, and their marriage was marked by social and cultural events.\n\n**India and Gandhi**\n\nIn 1924, Mosley and his wife traveled to British India, accompanied by Mosley's father-in-law, the 1st Earl Curzon of Kedleston. The trip was a significant event in Mosley's life, and he was exposed to the politics and culture of India during this time. Mosley's experiences in India had a profound impact on his later life and politics.\n\n**Marriage to Diana Mitford**\n\nCynthia died of peritonitis in 1933, and Mosley married his mistress, Diana Guinness, née Mitford, in secret in Nazi Germany on October 6, 1936. The marriage was a highly publicized event, and Mosley's new wife was a prominent figure in the fascist movement.\n\n**Member of Parliament**\n\nBy the end of World War I, Mosley had decided to pursue a career in politics and was elected as a Conservative member of parliament in 1918. Mosley's early politics were marked by a passionate conviction to avoid future wars, and he spoke out against the Irish War of Independence.\n\n**Crossing the Floor**\n\nMosley's politics became increasingly radical, and he eventually crossed the floor to join the Labour Party. Mosley's decision to join the Labour Party was motivated by his desire to pursue his own brand of socialism, which he believed was more radical than the Labour Party's policies.\n\n**Office**\n\nMosley's time in office was marked by controversy and conflict. He was appointed as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in 1929, but his radical proposals were blocked by the cabinet and Lord Privy Seal James Henry Thomas.\n\n**Mosley Memorandum**\n\nIn 1932, Mosley put forward a scheme in the \"Mosley Memorandum\" that called for high tariffs to protect British industries from international finance and transform the British Empire into an autarkic trading bloc. The memorandum also proposed state nationalization of main industries, higher school-leaving ages and pensions to reduce the labour surplus, and a program of public works to solve interwar poverty and unemployment.\n\n**New Party**\n\nDissatisfied with the Labour Party, Mosley and six other Labour MPs founded the New Party. However, the party was short-lived, and Mosley eventually left to pursue his fascist politics.\n\n**Fascism**\n\nAfter his election failure in 1931, Mosley went on a study tour of fascist movements in Italy and other countries. He was convinced by Fascist Italy's economic program and returned to the UK to found the British Union of Fascists (BUF). The BUF was a highly controversial organization that advocated for authoritarianism and protectionism.\n\n**Internment**\n\nIn May 1940, Mosley was detained by the British government under Defence Regulation 18B for his perceived threat to national security. Mosley was interned along with his wife, Diana, and other prominent fascists. The BUF was eventually proscribed by the British government.\n\n**Post-war Politics**\n\nAfter the war, Mosley attempted to revive his fascist politics but faced significant opposition. He eventually formed the Union Movement, which advocated for a single nation-state to cover the continent of Europe. Mosley's politics remained highly controversial, and he was subjected to physical disruption at his meetings.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nMosley had three children with his first wife, Lady Cynthia Curzon. He later married Diana Mitford, and the couple had a son together.\n\n**Death and Funeral**\n\nOswald Mosley died on December 3, 1980, in Orsay, France. His body was cremated, and his ashes were scattered on the pond at Orsay.\n\n**Coat of Arms**\n\nMosley's coat of arms was a family crest that featured a lion, a unicorn, and other symbols of British nobility.\n\n**Electoral Record**\n\nMosley's electoral record was marked by controversy and conflict. He was elected as a Conservative member of parliament in 1918 but was later expelled from the party for his radical politics.\n\n**Archive and Residences**\n\nMosley's personal papers are held at the University of Birmingham's Special Collections Archive.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nMosley has been the subject of numerous books, films, and other works of fiction. He has also been portrayed in comics and alternative history fiction.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* British Union of Fascists\n* Fascism\n* Oswald Mosley's electoral record\n* Oswald Mosley's personal

was transmitted to the Romans via Celtic speakers [12]\n\n\nModern definitions and controversies\nThe modern definition of Germanic peoples developed in the 19th century, when the term Germanic was linked to the newly identified Germanic language family Linguistics provided a new way of defining the Germanic peoples, which came to be used in historiography and archaeology [19] [2] While Roman authors did not consistently exclude Celtic-speaking people or have a term corresponding to Germanic-speaking peoples, this new definition—which used the Germanic language as the main criterion—presented the Germani as a people or nation (Volk) with a stable group identity linked to language As a result, some scholars treat the Germani (Latin) or Germanoi (Greek) of Roman-era sources as non-Germanic if they seemingly spoke non-Germanic languages [20] For clarity, Germanic peoples, when defined as \"speakers of a Germanic language\", are sometimes referred to as \"Germanic-speaking peoples\" [2] Today, the term \"Germanic\" is widely applied to \"phenomena including identities, social, cultural or political groups, to material cultural artefacts, languages and texts, and even specific chemical sequences found in human DNA\" [21] Several scholars continue to use the term to refer to a culture existing between the 1st to 4th centuries CE, but most historians and archaeologists researching Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages no longer use it [22]\n\n\nClassical terminology\nThe first author to describe the Germani as a large category of peoples distinct from the Gauls and Scythians was Julius Caesar, writing around 55 BCE during his governorship of Gaul [35] In Caesar's account, the clearest defining characteristic of the Germani people was that their homeland was east of the Rhine, [36] opposite Gaul on the west side Caesar sought to explain both why his legions stopped at the Rhine and also why the Germani were more dangerous than the Gauls to the empire [37] Explaining this threat he also classified the Cimbri and Teutons, who had previously invaded Italy, as Germani [38] [39] Although Caesar described the Rhine as the border between Germani and Celts, he also describes the Germani cisrhenani on the west bank of the Rhine, who he believed had moved from the east [40] It is unclear if these Germani were actually Germanic speakers [41] According to the Roman historian Tacitus in his Germania (c 98 CE), it was among this group, specifically the Tungri, that the name Germani first arose, before it spread to further groups [42] Tacitus reported that in his time many of the peoples west of the Rhine within Roman Gaul were still considered Germani [43] Caesar's division of the Germani from the Celts was not taken up by most writers in Greek [44]\n\n\nSubdivisions\nSeveral ancient sources list subdivisions of the Germanic tribes Writing in the first century CE, Pliny the Elder lists five Germanic subgroups: the Vandili, the Inguaeones, the Istuaeones (living near the Rhine), the Herminones (in the Germanic interior), and the Peucini Basternae (living on the lower Danube near the Dacians) [57] In chapter 2 of the Germania, written about a half-century later, Tacitus lists only three subgroups: the Ingvaeones (near the sea), the Herminones (in the interior of Germania), and the Istvaeones (the remainder of the tribes); [58] Tacitus says these groups each claimed descent from the god Mannus, son of Tuisto [59] Tacitus also mentions a second tradition that there were four sons of either Mannus or Tuisto from whom the groups of the Marsi, Gambrivi, Suebi, and Vandili claim descent [60] [61] The Herminones are also mentioned by Pomponius Mela, but otherwise, these divisions do not appear in other ancient works on the Germani [60]\n\n\nLanguages\nAll Germanic languages derive from the Proto-Indo-European language (PIE), which is generally thought to have been spoken between 4500 and 2500 BCE [67] The ancestor of Germanic languages is referred to as Proto- or Common Germanic, [68] and likely represented a group of mutually intelligible dialects [69] They share distinctive characteristics which set them apart from other Indo-European sub-families of languages, such as Grimm's and Verner's law, the conservation of the PIE ablaut system in the Germanic verb system (notably in strong verbs), or the merger of the vowels a and o qualities (ə, a, o > a; ā, ō > ō) [70] During the Pre-Germanic linguistic period (2500–500 BCE), the proto-language was almost certainly influenced by an unknown non-Indo-European language, still noticeable in the Germanic phonology and lexicon [71] [c]\n\n\nProto-Germanic\nAll Germanic languages derive from the

Pre-Germanic linguistic period (2500–500 BCE), the proto-language was almost certainly influenced by an unknown non-Indo-European language, still noticeable in the Germanic phonology and lexicon [71] [c]\n\n\nEarly attestations\nDefinite and comprehensive evidence of Germanic lexical units only occurred after Caesar's conquest of Gaul in the 1st century BCE, after which contacts with Proto-Germanic speakers began to intensify The Alcis, a pair of brother gods worshipped by the Nahanarvali, are given by Tacitus as a Latinized form of *alhiz (a kind of 'stag'), and the word sapo ('hair dye') is certainly borrowed from Proto-Germanic *saipwōn- (English soap), as evidenced by the parallel Finnish loanword saipio [78] The name of the framea, described by Tacitus as a short spear carried by Germanic warriors, most likely derives from the compound *fram-ij-an- ('forward-going one'), as suggested by comparable semantical structures found in early runes (e.g., raun-ij-az 'tester', on a lancehead) and linguistic cognates attested in the later Old Norse, Old Saxon and Old High German languages: fremja, fremmian and fremmen all mean 'to carry out' [79]\n\n\nLinguistic disintegration\nBy the time Germanic speakers entered written history, their linguistic territory had stretched farther south, since a Germanic dialect continuum (where neighbouring language varieties diverged only slightly between each other, but remote dialects were not necessarily mutually intelligible due to accumulated differences over the distance) covered a region roughly located between the Rhine, the Vistula, the Danube, and southern Scandinavia during the first two centuries of the Common Era [83] East Germanic speakers dwelled on the Baltic sea coasts and islands, while speakers of the Northwestern dialects occupied territories in present-day Denmark and bordering parts of Germany at the earliest date when they can be identified [84]\n\n\nClassification\nThe Germanic languages are traditionally divided between East, North and West Germanic branches [88] The modern prevailing view is that North and West Germanic were also encompassed in a larger subgroup called Northwest Germanic [89]\n\n\nHistory\nThe Germanic-speaking peoples speak an Indo-European language The leading theory for the origin of Germanic languages, suggested by archaeological, linguistic and genetic evidence, [102] postulates a diffusion of Indo-European languages from the Pontic–Caspian steppe towards Northern Europe during the third millennium BCE, via linguistic contacts and migrations from the Corded Ware culture towards modern-day Denmark, resulting in cultural mixing with the earlier Funnelbeaker culture [103] [e] The subsequent culture of the Nordic Bronze Age (c 2000/1750 – c 500 BCE) shows definite cultural and population continuities with later Germanic peoples, [7] and is often supposed to have been the culture in which the Germanic Parent Language, the predecessor of the Proto-Germanic language, developed [104] However, it is unclear whether these earlier peoples possessed any ethnic continuity with the later Germanic peoples [8]\n\n\nPrehistory\nThe Germanic-speaking

However, it is unclear whether these earlier peoples possessed any ethnic continuity with the later Germanic peoples [8]\n\n\nEarliest recorded history\nAccording to some authors the Bastarnae, or Peucini, were the first Germani to be encountered by the Greco-Roman world and thus to be mentioned in historical records [118] They appear in historical sources going as far back as the 3rd century BCE through the 4th century CE [119] Another eastern people known from about 200 BCE, and sometimes believed to be Germanic-speaking, are the Sciri (Greek: Skiroi), who are recorded threatening the city of Olbia on the Black Sea [120] Late in the 2nd century BCE, Roman and Greek sources recount the migrations of the Cimbri, Teutones and Ambrones whom Caesar later classified as Germanic [121] The movements of these groups through parts of Gaul, Italy and Hispania resulted in the Cimbrian War (113–101 BCE) against the Romans, in which the Teutons and Cimbri were victorious over several Roman armies but were ultimately defeated [122] [123] [124]\n\n\nRoman Imperial Period to 375\nThroughout the reign of Augustus—from 27 BCE until 14 CE—the Roman empire expanded into Gaul, with the Rhine as a border Starting in 13 BCE, there were Roman campaigns across the Rhine for a 28-year period [132] First came the pacification of the Usipetes, Sicambri, and Frisians near the Rhine, then attacks increased further from the Rhine, on the Chauci, Cherusci, Chatti and Suevi (including the Marcomanni) [133] These campaigns eventually reached and even crossed the Elbe, and in 5 CE Tiberius was able to show strength by having a Roman fleet enter the Elbe and meet the legions in the heart of Germania [134] Once Tiberius subdued the Germanic people between the Rhine and the Elbe, the region at least up to Weser—and possibly up to the Elbe—was made the Roman province Germania and provided soldiers to the Roman army [135] [136]\n\n\nEarly Roman Imperial period (27 BCE – 166 CE)\nThroughout the reign of Augustus—from 27 BCE until 14 CE—the Roman empire expanded into Gaul, with the Rhine as a border Starting in 13 BCE, there were Roman campaigns across the Rhine for a 28-year period [132] First came the pacification of the Usipetes, Sicambri, and Frisians near the Rhine, then attacks increased further from the Rhine, on the Chauci, Cherusci, Chatti and Suevi (including the Marcomanni)

[134] Once Tiberius subdued the Germanic people between the Rhine and the Elbe, the region at least up to Weser—and possibly up to the Elbe—was made the Roman province Germania and provided soldiers to the Roman army [135] [136]\n\n\nMarcomannic Wars to 375 CE\nFollowing sixty years of quiet on the frontier, 166 CE saw a major incursion of peoples from north of the Danube during the reign of Marcus Aurelius, beginning the Marcomannic Wars [154] By 168 (during the Antonine plague), barbarian hosts consisting of Marcomanni, Quadi, and Sarmatian Iazyges, attacked and pushed their way to Italy [155] They advanced as far as Upper Italy, destroyed Opitergium/Oderzo and besieged Aquileia [156] The Romans had finished the war by 180, through a combination of Roman military victories, the resettling of some peoples on Roman territory, and by making alliances with others [157] Marcus Aurelius's successor Commodus chose not to permanently occupy any territory conquered north of the Danube, and the following decades saw an increase in the defenses at the limes [156] The Romans renewed their right to choose the kings of the Marcomanni and Quadi, and Commodus forbid them to hold assemblies unless a Roman centurion was present [158]\n\n\nMigration Period (c. 375–568)\nThe Migration Period is traditionally cited by historians as beginning in 375 CE, under the assumption that the appearance of the Huns prompted the Visigoths to seek shelter within the Roman Empire in 376 [174] The end of the migration period is usually set at 568 when the Lombards invaded Italy During this time period, numerous barbarian groups invaded the Roman Empire and established new kingdoms within its boundaries [175] These Germanic migrations traditionally mark the transition between antiquity and the beginning of the early Middle Ages [176] The reasons for the migrations of the period are unclear, but scholars have proposed overpopulation, climate change, bad harvests, famines, and adventurousness as possible reasons [177] Migrations were probably carried out by relatively small groups rather than entire peoples [178]\n\n\nEarly Migration Period (before 375–420)\nThe Greuthungi, a Gothic group in modern Ukraine under the rule of Ermanaric, were among the first peoples attacked by the Huns, apparently facing Hunnic pressure for some years [179] Following Ermanaric's death, the Greuthungi's resistance broke and they moved toward the Dniester river [180] A second Gothic group, the Tervingi under King Athanaric, constructed a defensive earthwork against the Huns near the Dniester [181] However, these measures did not stop the Huns and the majority of the Tervingi abandoned Athanaric; they subsequently fled—accompanied by a contingent of Greuthungi—to the Danube in 376, seeking asylum in the Roman Empire [182] The emperor Valens chose only to admit the Tervingi, who were settled in the Roman provinces of Thrace and Moesia [181] [183]\n\n\nThe Hunnic Empire (c. 420–453)\nIn 428, the Vandal leader Geiseric moved his forces across the strait of Gibraltar into north Africa Within two years, they had conquered most of north Africa [209] By 434, following a renewed political crisis in Rome, the Rhine frontier had collapsed, and in order to restore it, the Roman magister militum Flavius Aetius engineered the destruction of the Burgundian kingdom in 435/436, possibly with Hunnic mercenaries, and launched several successful campaigns against the Visigoths [210] In 439, the Vandals conquered Carthage, which served as an excellent base for further raids throughout the Mediterranean and became the basis for the Vandal Kingdom [211] The loss of Carthage forced Aetius to make peace with the Visigoths in 442, effectively recognizing their independence within the boundaries of the empire [212] During the resulting peace, Aetius resettled the Burgundians in Sapaudia in southern Gaul [213] In the 430s, Aetius negotiated peace with the Suevi in Spain, leading to a practical loss of Roman control in the province [214] Despite the peace, the Suevi expanded their territory by conquering Mérida in 439 and Seville in 441 [215]\n\n\nAfter the death of Attila (453–568)\nIn 455, in the aftermath of the death of Aetius in 453 and the murder of emperor Valentinian III in 455, [223] the Vandals invaded Italy and sacked Rome in 455 [224] In 456, the Romans persuaded the Visigoths to fight the Suevi, who had broken their treaty with Rome The Visigoths and a force of Burgundians and Franks defeated the Suevi at the Battle of Campus Paramus, reducing Suevi control to northwestern Spain [215] The Visigoths went on to conquer all of the Iberian Peninsula by 484 except a small part that remained under Suevian control [225]\n\n\nEarly Middle Ages to c. 800\nMerovingian Frankia became divided into three subkingdoms: Austrasia in the east around the Rhine and Meuse, Neustria in the west around Paris, and Burgundy in the southeast around Chalon-sur-Saône [243] The Franks ruled a multilingual and multi-ethnic kingdom, divided between a mostly Romance-speaking West and a mostly Germanic-speaking east, that integrated former Roman elites but remained centered on a Frankish ethnic identity [244] In 687, the Pippinids came to control the Merovingian rulers as mayors of the palace in Neustria Under their direction, the subkingdoms of Frankia were reunited [245] Following the mayoralty of Charles Martel, the Pippinids replaced the Merovingians as kings in 751, when Charles's son Pepin the Short became king and founded the Carolingian dynasty His son, Charlemagne, would go on to conquer the Lombards, Saxons, and Bavarians [246] Charlemagne was crowned Roman emperor in 800 and regarded his residence of Aachen as the new Rome [247]\n\n\nReligion\nGermanic paganism refers to the traditional, culturally significant religion of the Germanic-speaking peoples [261] It did not form a uniform religious system across Germanic-speaking Europe, but varied from place to place, people to people, and time to time In many contact areas (e.g Rhineland and eastern and northern Scandinavia), it was similar to neighboring religions such as those of the Slavs, Celts, and Finnic peoples [262] The term is sometimes applied as early as the Stone Age, Bronze Age, or the earlier Iron Age, but it is more generally restricted to the time period after the Germanic languages had become distinct from other Indo-European languages From the first reports in Roman sources to the final conversion to Christianity, Germanic paganism thus covers a period of around one thousand years [263] Scholars are divided as to the degree of continuity between the religious practices of the earlier Germanic peoples and those attested in later Norse paganism and elsewhere: while some scholars argue that Tacitus, early medieval sources, and the Norse sources indicate religious continuity, other scholars are highly skeptical of such arguments [264]\n\n\nGermanic paganism\nGermanic paganism refers to the traditional, culturally significant religion of the Germanic-speaking peoples [261] It did not form a uniform religious

of such arguments [264]\n\n\nConversion to Christianity\nGermanic peoples began entering the Roman Empire in large numbers at the same time that Christianity was spreading there, [282] and this connection was a major factor encouraging conversion [283] The East Germanic peoples, the Langobards, and the Suevi in Spain converted to Arian Christianity, [284] a form of Christianity that believed that God the Father was superior to God the Son [285] The first Germanic people to convert to Arianism were the Visigoths, at the latest in 376 when they entered the Roman Empire This followed a longer period of missionary work by both Orthodox Christians and Arians, such as the Arian Wulfila, who was made missionary bishop of the Goths in 341 and translated the Bible into Gothic [286] The Arian Germanic peoples all eventually converted to Nicene Christianity, which had become the dominant form of Christianity within the Roman Empire; the last to convert were the Visigoths in Spain under their king Reccared in 587 [287]\n\n\nSociety and culture\nGermanic speakers developed a native script, the runes (or the fuþark), and the earliest known form of which consists of 24 characters The runes are generally held to have been used exclusively by Germanic-speaking populations [l] All known early runic inscriptions are found in Germanic contexts with the potential exception of one inscription, which may indicate cultural transfer between the Germanic speakers to Slavic speakers (and may potentially be the earliest known writing among Slavic speakers) [m]\n\n\nRunic

between the Germanic speakers to Slavic speakers (and may potentially be the earliest known writing among Slavic speakers) [m]\n\n\nPersonal names\nGermanic personal names are commonly dithematic, consisting of two components that may be combined freely (such as the Old Norse female personal name Sigríðr, consisting of sigr 'victory' + fríðr 'beloved') As summarized by Per Vikstrand, \"The old Germanic personal names are, from a social and ideological point of view, characterized by three main features: religion, heroism, and family bonds The religious aspect  [of Germanic names] seems to be an inherited, Indo-European trace, which the Germanic languages share with Greek and other Indo-European languages.\" [310]\n\n\nPoetry and legend\nThe ancient Germanic-speaking peoples were a largely oral culture Written literature in Germanic languages is not recorded until the 6th century (Gothic Bible) or the 8th century in modern England and Germany [312] The philologist Andreas Heusler proposed the existence of various genres of literature in the \"Old Germanic\" period, which were largely based on genres found in high medieval Old Norse poetry These include ritual poetry, epigrammatic poetry (Spruchdichtung), memorial verses (Merkdichtung), lyric, narrative poetry, and praise poetry [313] Heinrich Beck suggests that, on the basis of Latin mentions in late antiquity and the early Middle Ages, the following genres can be adduced: origo gentis (the origin of a people or their rulers), the fall of heroes (casus heroici), praise poetry, and laments for the dead [314]\n\n\nGermanic law\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, the majority of scholars assumed the existence of a distinct Germanic legal culture and law [325] Early ideas about Germanic law have come under intense scholarly scrutiny since the 1950s, and specific aspects of it such as the legal importance of Sippe, retinues, and loyalty, and the concept of outlawry can no longer be justified [326] [327] Besides the assumption of a common Germanic legal tradition and the use of sources of different types from different places and time periods, [326] there are no native sources for early Germanic law [328] [329] The earliest written legal sources, the Leges Barbarorum, were all written under Roman and Christian influence and often with the help of Roman jurists, [330] and contain large amounts of \"Vulgar Latin Law\", an unofficial legal system that functioned in the Roman provinces [331]\n\n\nWarfare\nWarfare seems to have been a constant in Germanic society, [336] including conflicts among and within Germanic peoples [337] There is no common Germanic word for \"war\", and it was not necessarily differentiated from other forms of violence [338] Historical information on Germanic warfare almost entirely depends on Greco-Roman sources, [339] however their accuracy has been questioned [340] The core of the army was formed by the comitatus (retinue), a group of warriors following a chief [341] As retinues grew larger, their names could become associated with entire peoples Many retinues functioned as auxilia (mercenary units in the Roman army) [342]\n\n\nEconomy and material culture\nUnlike agriculture in the Roman provinces, which was organized around the large farms known as villae rusticae, Germanic agriculture was organized around villages When Germanic peoples expanded into northern Gaul in the 4th and 5th centuries CE, they brought this village-based agriculture with them, which increased the agricultural productivity of the land; Heiko Steuer suggests this means that Germania was more agriculturally productive than is generally assumed [351] Villages were not distant from each other but often within sight, revealing a fairly high population density, and contrary to the assertions of Roman sources, only about 30% of Germania was covered in forest, about the same percentage as today [352]\n\n\nAgriculture and population

density, and contrary to the assertions of Roman sources, only about 30% of Germania was covered in forest, about the same percentage as today [352]\n\n\nCrafts\nIt is unclear if there was a special class of craftsmen in Germania, however archaeological finds of tools are frequent [356] Many everyday items such as dishes were made out of wood, and archaeology has found the remains of wooden well construction [357] The 4th-century CE Nydam and Illerup ships show highly developed knowledge of ship construction, while elite graves have revealed wooden furniture with complex joinery [358] Products made from ceramics included cooking, drinking, and storage, vessels, as well as lamps While originally formed by hand, the period around 1 CE saw the introduction of the potter's wheel [359] Some of the ceramics produced on potter's wheels seem to have been done in direct imitation of Roman wares, [360] and may have been produced by Romans in Germania or by Germani who had learned Roman techniques while serving in the Roman army [361] The shape and decoration of Germanic ceramics vary by region and archaeologists have traditionally used these variations to determine larger cultural areas [362] Many ceramics were probably produced locally in hearths, but large pottery kilns have also been discovered, and it seems clear that there were areas of specialized production [360]\n\n\nMetalworking\nDespite the claims of Roman writers such as Tacitus that the Germani had little iron and lacked expertise in working it, deposits of iron were commonly found in Germania and Germanic smiths were skillful metalworkers [364] Smithies are known from multiple settlements, and smiths were often buried with their tools [365] An iron mine discovered at Rudki, in the Łysogóry mountains of modern central Poland, operated from the 1st to the 4th centuries CE and included a substantial smelting workshop; similar facilities have been found in Bohemia [366] The remains of large smelting operations have been discovered by Ribe in Jutland (4th to 6th century CE), [367] as well as at Glienick in northern Germany and at Heeten in the Netherlands (both 4th century CE) [368] Germanic smelting furnaces may have produced metal that was as high-quality as that produced by the Romans [369] In addition to large-scale production, nearly every individual settlement seems to have produced some iron for local use [367] Iron was used for agricultural tools, tools for various crafts, and for weapons [370]\n\n\nClothing and textiles\nClothing does not generally preserve well archaeologically Early Germanic clothing is shown on some Roman stone monuments such as Trajan's Column and the Column of Marcus Aurelius, and is occasionally discovered in finds from in moors, [380] mostly from Scandinavia [381] Frequent finds include long trousers, sometimes including connected stockings, shirt-like gowns (Kittel) with long sleeves, large pieces of cloth, and capes with fur on the inside [382] All of these are thought to be male clothing, while finds of tubular garments are thought to be female clothing These would have reached to the ankles and would likely have been held in place by brooches at the height of the shoulders, as shown on Roman monuments [383] On Roman depictions, the dress was gathered below the breast or at the waist, and there are frequently no sleeves Sometimes a blouse or skirt is depicted below the dress, along with a neckerchief around the throat [384] By the middle of the 5th century CE, both men and women among the continental Germanic peoples came to wear a Roman-style tunic as their most important piece of clothing This was secured at the waist and likely adopted due to intensive contact with the Roman world [385] The Romans typically depict Germanic men and women as bareheaded, although some head-coverings have been found Although Tacitus mentions an undergarment made of linen, no examples of these have been found [384]\n\n\nTrade\nArchaeology shows that from at least the turn of the 3rd century CE larger regional settlements in Germania existed that were not exclusively involved in an agrarian economy, and that the main settlements were connected by paved roads The entirety of Germania was within a system of long-distance trade [390] Migration-period seaborne trade is suggested by Gudme on the Danish island of Funen and other harbors on the Baltic [391]\n\n\nGenetics\nThe use of genetic studies to investigate the Germanic past is controversial, with scholars such as Guy Halsall suggesting it could represent a hearkening back to 19th-century ideas of race [402] Sebastian Brather, Wilhelm Heizmann, and Steffen Patzold write that genetics studies are of great use for demographic history, but cannot give us any information about cultural history [403] In a 2013 book which reviewed studies made up until then, scholars noted that most Germanic speakers today have a Y-DNA that is a mixture including haplogroup I1, R1a1a, R1b-P312 and R1b-U106; however, the authors also note that these groups are older than Germanic languages and found among speakers of other languages [404]\n\n\nModern reception\nThe rediscovery of Tacitus's Germania in the 1450s was used by German humanists to claim a glorious classical past for their nation that could compete with that of Greece and Rome, [405] and to equate the \"Germanic\" with the \"German\" [406] While the humanists' notion of the \"Germanic\" was initially vague, later it was narrowed and used to support a notion of German(ic) superiority to other nations [407] Equally important was Jordanes's Getica, rediscovered by Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini in the mid-15th century and first printed in 1515 by Konrad Peutinger, which depicted Scandinavia as the \"womb of nations\" (Latin: vagina nationum) from which all the historical northeastern European barbarians migrated in the distant past [408] While treated with suspicion by German scholars, who preferred the indigenous origin given by Tacitus, this motif became very popular in contemporary Swedish Gothicism, as it supported Sweden's imperial ambitions [409] Peutinger printed the Getica together with Paul the Deacon's History of the Lombards, so that the Germania, the Getica, and the History of the Lombards formed the basis for the study of the Germanic past [410] Scholars did not clearly differentiate between the Germanic peoples, Celtic peoples, and the \"Scythian peoples\" until the late 18th century with the discovery of Indo-European and the establishment of language as the primary criterion for nationality Before that time, German scholars considered the Celtic peoples to be part of the Germanic group [411]\n\n\nSee also\nClassical and medieval

in Northern Europe, specifically in the regions of modern-day Germany, Denmark, Norway, and parts of the United Kingdom. They were a diverse group of people who shared a common language, culture, and set of customs, but also had distinct regional identities and traditions.\n\n**Terminology**\n\nThe etymology of the Latin word Germani, from which Latin Germania and English Germanic are derived, is unknown, although several proposals have been put forward. Herwig Wolfram, for example, thinks Germani must be Gaulish, while Wolfgang Pfeifer more or less concurs with Wolfram and surmises that the name Germani is likely of Celtic etymology and is related to the Old Irish word gair ('neighbours') or could be tied to the Celtic word for their war cries, gairm, which simplifies into 'the neighbours' or 'the screamers'.\n\n**Classical Terminology**\n\nThe first author to describe the Germani as a large category of peoples distinct from the Gauls and Scythians was Julius Caesar, writing around 55 BCE during his governorship of Gaul. In Caesar's account, the clearest defining characteristic of the Germani people was that their homeland was east of the Rhine, opposite Gaul on the west side.\n\n**Subdivisions**\n\nSeveral ancient sources list subdivisions of the Germanic tribes. Writing in the first century CE, Pliny the Elder lists five Germanic subgroups: the Vandili, the Inguaeones, the Istuaeones (living near the Rhine), the Herminones (in the Germanic interior), and the Peucini Basternae (living on the lower Danube near the Dacians). In chapter 2 of the Germania, written about a half-century later, Tacitus lists only three subgroups: the Ingvaeones (near the sea), the Herminones (in the interior of Germania), and the Istvaeones (the remainder of the tribes).\n\n**Languages**\n\nAll Germanic languages derive from the Proto-Indo-European language (PIE), which is generally thought to have been spoken between 4500 and 2500 BCE. The ancestor of Germanic languages is referred to as Proto- or Common Germanic, and likely represented a group of mutually intelligible dialects. They share distinctive characteristics which set them apart from other Indo-European sub-families of languages, such as Grimm's and Verner's law, the conservation of the PIE ablaut system in the Germanic verb system (notably in strong verbs), or the merger of the vowels a and o qualities (ə, a, o > a; ā, ō > ō).\n\n**Early History**\n\nThe Germanic-speaking peoples speak an Indo-European language. The leading theory for the origin of Germanic languages, suggested by archaeological, linguistic, and genetic evidence, postulates a diffusion of Indo-European languages from the Pontic-Caspian steppe towards Northern Europe during the third millennium BCE, via linguistic contacts and migrations from the Corded Ware culture towards modern-day Denmark, resulting in cultural mixing with the earlier Funnelbeaker culture.\n\n**Migration Period**\n\nThe Migration Period is traditionally cited by historians as beginning in 375 CE, under the assumption that the appearance of the Huns prompted the Visigoths to seek shelter within the Roman Empire in 376. The end of the migration period is usually set at 568 when the Lombards invaded Italy. During this time period, numerous barbarian groups invaded the Roman Empire and established new kingdoms within its boundaries.\n\n**Conversion to Christianity**\n\nGermanic peoples began entering the Roman Empire in large numbers at the same time that Christianity was spreading there, and this connection was a major factor encouraging conversion. The East Germanic peoples, the Langobards, and the Suevi in Spain converted to Arian Christianity, a form of Christianity that believed that God the Father was superior to God the Son.\n\n**Society and Culture**\n\nGermanic speakers developed a native script, the runes (or the fuþark), and the earliest known form of which consists of 24 characters. The ancient Germanic-speaking peoples were a largely oral culture. Written literature in Germanic languages is not recorded until the 6th century (Gothic Bible) or the 8th century in modern England and Germany.\n\n**Warfare**\n\nWarfare seems to have been a constant in Germanic society, including conflicts among and within Germanic peoples. The core of the army was formed by the comitatus (retinue), a group of warriors following a chief.\n\n**Economy and Material Culture**\n\nUnlike agriculture in the Roman provinces, which was organized around the large farms known as villae rusticae, Germanic agriculture was organized around villages. Villages were not distant from each other but often within sight, revealing a fairly high population density.\n\n**Genetics**\n\nThe use of genetic studies to investigate the Germanic past is controversial, with scholars such as Guy Halsall suggesting it could represent a hearkening back to 19th-century ideas of race. However, genetics studies are of great use for demographic history, and cannot give us any information about cultural history.\n\n**Modern Reception**\n\nThe rediscovery of Tacitus's Germania in the 1450s was used by German humanists to claim a glorious classical past for their nation that could compete with that of Greece and Rome. While the humanists' notion of the \"Germanic\" was initially vague, later it was narrowed and used to support a notion of German(ic) superiority to other nations.\n\n**See Also**\n\nClassical and

controversies\nThe modern definition of Germanic peoples developed in the 19th century, when the term Germanic was linked to the newly identified Germanic language family Linguistics provided a new way of defining the Germanic peoples, which came to be used in historiography and archaeology [19] [2] While Roman authors did not consistently exclude Celtic-speaking people or have a term corresponding to Germanic-speaking peoples, this new definition—which used the Germanic language as the main criterion—presented the Germani as a people or nation (Volk) with a stable group identity linked to language As a result, some scholars treat the Germani (Latin) or Germanoi (Greek) of Roman-era sources as non-Germanic if they seemingly spoke non-Germanic languages [20] For clarity, Germanic peoples, when defined as \"speakers of a Germanic language\", are sometimes referred to as \"Germanic-speaking peoples\" [2] Today, the term \"Germanic\" is widely applied to \"phenomena including identities, social, cultural or political groups, to material cultural artefacts, languages and texts, and even specific chemical sequences found in human DNA\" [21] Several scholars continue to use the term to refer to a culture existing between the 1st to 4th centuries CE, but most historians and archaeologists researching Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages no longer use it [22]\n\n\nClassical terminology\nThe first author to describe the Germani as a large category of peoples distinct from the Gauls and Scythians was Julius Caesar, writing around 55 BCE during his governorship of Gaul [35] In Caesar's account, the clearest defining characteristic of the Germani people was that their homeland was east of the Rhine, [36] opposite Gaul on the west side Caesar sought to explain both why his legions stopped at the Rhine and also why the Germani were more dangerous than the Gauls to the empire [37] Explaining this threat he also classified the Cimbri and Teutons, who had previously invaded Italy, as Germani [38] [39] Although Caesar described the Rhine as the border between Germani and Celts, he also describes the Germani cisrhenani on the west bank of the Rhine, who he believed had moved from the east [40] It is unclear if these Germani were actually Germanic speakers [41] According to the Roman historian Tacitus in his Germania (c 98 CE), it was among this group, specifically the Tungri, that the name Germani first arose, before it spread to further groups [42] Tacitus reported that in his time many of the peoples west of the Rhine within Roman Gaul were still considered Germani [43] Caesar's division of the Germani from the Celts was not taken up by most writers in Greek [44]\n\n\nSubdivisions\nSeveral ancient sources list subdivisions of the Germanic tribes Writing in the first century CE, Pliny the Elder lists five Germanic subgroups: the Vandili, the Inguaeones, the Istuaeones (living near the Rhine), the Herminones (in the Germanic interior), and the Peucini Basternae (living on the lower Danube near the Dacians) [57] In chapter 2 of the Germania, written about a half-century later, Tacitus lists only three subgroups: the Ingvaeones (near the sea), the Herminones (in the interior of Germania), and the Istvaeones (the remainder of the tribes); [58] Tacitus says these groups each claimed descent from the god Mannus, son of Tuisto [59] Tacitus also mentions a second tradition that there were four sons of either Mannus or Tuisto from whom the groups of the Marsi, Gambrivi, Suebi, and Vandili claim descent [60] [61] The Herminones are also mentioned by Pomponius Mela, but otherwise, these divisions do not appear in other ancient works on the Germani [60]\n\n\nLanguages\nAll Germanic languages derive from the Proto-Indo-European language (PIE), which is generally thought to have been spoken between 4500 and 2500 BCE [67] The ancestor of Germanic languages is referred to as Proto- or Common Germanic, [68] and likely represented a group of mutually intelligible dialects [69] They share distinctive characteristics which set them apart from other Indo-European sub-families of languages, such as Grimm's and Verner's law, the conservation of the PIE ablaut system in the Germanic verb system (notably in strong verbs), or the merger of the vowels a and o qualities (ə, a, o > a; ā, ō > ō) [70] During the Pre-Germanic linguistic period (2500–500 BCE), the proto-language was almost certainly influenced by an unknown non-Indo-European language, still noticeable in the Germanic phonology and lexicon [71] [c]\n\n\nProto-Germanic\nAll Germanic languages derive from the Proto-Indo-European language (PIE), which is generally thought to have been spoken between 4500 and 2500 BCE [67] The

non-Indo-European language, still noticeable in the Germanic phonology and lexicon [71] [c]\n\n\nEarly attestations\nDefinite and comprehensive evidence of Germanic lexical units only occurred after Caesar's conquest of Gaul in the 1st century BCE, after which contacts with Proto-Germanic speakers began to intensify The Alcis, a pair of brother gods worshipped by the Nahanarvali, are given by Tacitus as a Latinized form of *alhiz (a kind of 'stag'), and the word sapo ('hair dye') is certainly borrowed from Proto-Germanic *saipwōn- (English soap), as evidenced by the parallel Finnish loanword saipio [78] The name of the framea, described by Tacitus as a short spear carried by Germanic warriors, most likely derives from the compound *fram-ij-an- ('forward-going one'), as suggested by comparable semantical structures found in early runes (e.g., raun-ij-az 'tester', on a lancehead) and linguistic cognates attested in the later Old Norse, Old Saxon and Old High German languages: fremja, fremmian and fremmen all mean 'to carry out' [79]\n\n\nLinguistic disintegration\nBy the time Germanic speakers entered written history, their linguistic territory had stretched farther south, since a Germanic dialect continuum (where neighbouring language varieties diverged only slightly between each other, but remote dialects were not necessarily mutually intelligible due to accumulated differences over the distance) covered a region roughly located between the Rhine, the Vistula, the Danube, and southern Scandinavia during the first two centuries of the Common Era [83] East Germanic speakers dwelled on the Baltic sea coasts and islands, while speakers of the Northwestern dialects occupied territories in present-day Denmark and bordering parts of Germany at the earliest date when they can be identified [84]\n\n\nClassification\nThe Germanic languages are traditionally divided between East, North and West Germanic branches [88] The modern prevailing view is that North and West Germanic were also encompassed in a larger subgroup called Northwest Germanic [89]\n\n\nHistory\nThe Germanic-speaking peoples speak an Indo-European language The leading theory for the origin of Germanic languages, suggested by archaeological, linguistic and genetic evidence, [102] postulates a diffusion of Indo-European languages from the Pontic–Caspian steppe towards Northern Europe during the third millennium BCE, via linguistic contacts and migrations from the Corded Ware culture towards modern-day Denmark, resulting in cultural mixing with the earlier Funnelbeaker culture [103] [e] The subsequent culture of the Nordic Bronze Age (c 2000/1750 – c 500 BCE) shows definite cultural and population continuities with later Germanic peoples, [7] and is often supposed to have been the culture in which the Germanic Parent Language, the predecessor of the Proto-Germanic language, developed [104] However, it is unclear whether these earlier peoples possessed any ethnic continuity with the later Germanic peoples [8]\n\n\nPrehistory\nThe Germanic-speaking peoples speak an Indo-European language The leading theory for the origin of Germanic languages, suggested by archaeological,

predecessor of the Proto-Germanic language, developed [104] However, it is unclear whether these earlier peoples possessed any ethnic continuity with the later Germanic peoples [8]\n\n\nEarliest recorded history\nAccording to some authors the Bastarnae, or Peucini, were the first Germani to be encountered by the Greco-Roman world and thus to be mentioned in historical records [118] They appear in historical sources going as far back as the 3rd century BCE through the 4th century CE [119] Another eastern people known from about 200 BCE, and sometimes believed to be Germanic-speaking, are the Sciri (Greek: Skiroi), who are recorded threatening the city of Olbia on the Black Sea [120] Late in the 2nd century BCE, Roman and Greek sources recount the migrations of the Cimbri, Teutones and Ambrones whom Caesar later classified as Germanic [121] The movements of these groups through parts of Gaul, Italy and Hispania resulted in the Cimbrian War (113–101 BCE) against the Romans, in which the Teutons and Cimbri were victorious over several Roman armies but were ultimately defeated [122] [123] [124]\n\n\nRoman Imperial Period to 375\nThroughout the reign of Augustus—from 27 BCE until 14 CE—the Roman empire expanded into Gaul, with the Rhine as a border Starting in 13 BCE, there were Roman campaigns across the Rhine for a 28-year period [132] First came the pacification of the Usipetes, Sicambri, and Frisians near the Rhine, then attacks increased further from the Rhine, on the Chauci, Cherusci, Chatti and Suevi (including the Marcomanni) [133] These campaigns eventually reached and even crossed the Elbe, and in 5 CE Tiberius was able to show strength by having a Roman fleet enter the Elbe and meet the legions in the heart of Germania [134] Once Tiberius subdued the Germanic people between the Rhine and the Elbe, the region at least up to Weser—and possibly up to the Elbe—was made the Roman province Germania and provided soldiers to the Roman army [135] [136]\n\n\nEarly Roman Imperial period (27 BCE – 166 CE)\nThroughout the reign of Augustus—from 27 BCE until 14 CE—the Roman empire expanded into Gaul, with the Rhine as a border Starting in 13 BCE, there were Roman campaigns across the Rhine for a 28-year period [132] First came the pacification of the Usipetes, Sicambri, and Frisians near the Rhine, then attacks increased further from the Rhine, on the Chauci, Cherusci, Chatti and Suevi (including the Marcomanni) [133] These campaigns eventually reached and even crossed the Elbe, and in 5 CE Tiberius was able to show strength by

possibly up to the Elbe—was made the Roman province Germania and provided soldiers to the Roman army [135] [136]\n\n\nMarcomannic Wars to 375 CE\nFollowing sixty years of quiet on the frontier, 166 CE saw a major incursion of peoples from north of the Danube during the reign of Marcus Aurelius, beginning the Marcomannic Wars [154] By 168 (during the Antonine plague), barbarian hosts consisting of Marcomanni, Quadi, and Sarmatian Iazyges, attacked and pushed their way to Italy [155] They advanced as far as Upper Italy, destroyed Opitergium/Oderzo and besieged Aquileia [156] The Romans had finished the war by 180, through a combination of Roman military victories, the resettling of some peoples on Roman territory, and by making alliances with others [157] Marcus Aurelius's successor Commodus chose not to permanently occupy any territory conquered north of the Danube, and the following decades saw an increase in the defenses at the limes [156] The Romans renewed their right to choose the kings of the Marcomanni and Quadi, and Commodus forbid them to hold assemblies unless a Roman centurion was present [158]\n\n\nMigration Period (c. 375–568)\nThe Migration Period is traditionally cited by historians as beginning in 375 CE, under the assumption that the appearance of the Huns prompted the Visigoths to seek shelter within the Roman Empire in 376 [174] The end of the migration period is usually set at 568 when the Lombards invaded Italy During this time period, numerous barbarian groups invaded the Roman Empire and established new kingdoms within its boundaries [175] These Germanic migrations traditionally mark the transition between antiquity and the beginning of the early Middle Ages [176] The reasons for the migrations of the period are unclear, but scholars have proposed overpopulation, climate change, bad harvests, famines, and adventurousness as possible reasons [177] Migrations were probably carried out by relatively small groups rather than entire peoples [178]\n\n\nEarly Migration Period (before 375–420)\nThe Greuthungi, a Gothic group in modern Ukraine under the rule of Ermanaric, were among the first peoples attacked by the Huns, apparently facing Hunnic pressure for some years [179] Following Ermanaric's death, the Greuthungi's resistance broke and they moved toward the Dniester river [180] A second Gothic group, the Tervingi under King Athanaric, constructed a defensive earthwork against the Huns near the Dniester [181] However, these measures did not stop the Huns and the majority of the Tervingi abandoned Athanaric; they subsequently fled—accompanied by a contingent of Greuthungi—to the Danube in 376, seeking asylum in the Roman Empire [182] The emperor Valens chose only to admit the Tervingi, who were settled in the Roman provinces of Thrace and Moesia [181] [183]\n\n\nThe Hunnic Empire (c. 420–453)\nIn 428, the Vandal leader Geiseric moved his forces across the strait of Gibraltar into north Africa Within two years, they had conquered most of north Africa [209] By 434, following a renewed political crisis in Rome, the Rhine frontier had collapsed, and in order to restore it, the Roman magister militum Flavius Aetius engineered the destruction of the Burgundian kingdom in 435/436, possibly with Hunnic mercenaries, and launched several successful campaigns against the Visigoths [210] In 439, the Vandals conquered Carthage, which served as an excellent base for further raids throughout the Mediterranean and became the basis for the Vandal Kingdom [211] The loss of Carthage forced Aetius to make peace with the Visigoths in 442, effectively recognizing their independence within the boundaries of the empire [212] During the resulting peace, Aetius resettled the Burgundians in Sapaudia in southern Gaul [213] In the 430s, Aetius negotiated peace with the Suevi in Spain, leading to a practical loss of Roman control in the province [214] Despite the peace, the Suevi expanded their territory by conquering Mérida in 439 and Seville in 441 [215]\n\n\nAfter the death of Attila (453–568)\nIn 455, in the aftermath of the death of Aetius in 453 and the murder of emperor Valentinian III in 455, [223] the Vandals invaded Italy and sacked Rome in 455 [224] In 456, the Romans persuaded the Visigoths to fight the Suevi, who had broken their treaty with Rome The Visigoths and a force of Burgundians and Franks defeated the Suevi at the Battle of Campus Paramus, reducing Suevi control to northwestern Spain [215] The Visigoths went on to conquer all of the Iberian Peninsula by 484 except a small part that remained under Suevian control [225]\n\n\nEarly Middle Ages to c. 800\nMerovingian Frankia became divided into three subkingdoms: Austrasia in the east around the Rhine and Meuse, Neustria in the west around Paris, and Burgundy in the southeast around Chalon-sur-Saône [243] The Franks ruled a multilingual and multi-ethnic kingdom, divided between a mostly Romance-speaking West and a mostly Germanic-speaking east, that integrated former Roman elites but remained centered on a Frankish ethnic identity [244] In 687, the Pippinids came to control the Merovingian rulers as mayors of the palace in Neustria Under their direction, the subkingdoms of Frankia were reunited [245] Following the mayoralty of Charles Martel, the Pippinids replaced the Merovingians as kings in 751, when Charles's son Pepin the Short became king and founded the Carolingian dynasty His son, Charlemagne, would go on to conquer the Lombards, Saxons, and Bavarians [246] Charlemagne was crowned Roman emperor in 800 and regarded his residence of Aachen as the new Rome [247]\n\n\nReligion\nGermanic paganism refers to the traditional, culturally significant religion of the Germanic-speaking peoples [261] It did not form a uniform religious system across Germanic-speaking Europe, but varied from place to place, people to people, and time to time In many contact areas (e.g Rhineland and eastern and northern Scandinavia), it was similar to neighboring religions such as those of the Slavs, Celts, and Finnic peoples [262] The term is sometimes applied as early as the Stone Age, Bronze Age, or the earlier Iron Age, but it is more generally restricted to the time period after the Germanic languages had become distinct from other Indo-European languages From the first reports in Roman sources to the final conversion to Christianity, Germanic paganism thus covers a period of around one thousand years [263] Scholars are divided as to the degree of continuity between the religious practices of the earlier Germanic peoples and those attested in later Norse paganism and elsewhere: while some scholars argue that Tacitus, early medieval sources, and the Norse sources indicate religious continuity, other scholars are highly skeptical of such arguments [264]\n\n\nGermanic paganism\nGermanic paganism refers to the traditional, culturally significant religion

numbers at the same time that Christianity was spreading there, [282] and this connection was a major factor encouraging conversion [283] The East Germanic peoples, the Langobards, and the Suevi in Spain converted to Arian Christianity, [284] a form of Christianity that believed that God the Father was superior to God the Son [285] The first Germanic people to convert to Arianism were the Visigoths, at the latest in 376 when they entered the Roman Empire This followed a longer period of missionary work by both Orthodox Christians and Arians, such as the Arian Wulfila, who was made missionary bishop of the Goths in 341 and translated the Bible into Gothic [286] The Arian Germanic peoples all eventually converted to Nicene Christianity, which had become the dominant form of Christianity within the Roman Empire; the last to convert were the Visigoths in Spain under their king Reccared in 587 [287]\n\n\nSociety and culture\nGermanic speakers developed a native script, the runes (or the fuþark), and the earliest known form of which consists of 24 characters The runes are generally held to have been used exclusively by Germanic-speaking populations [l] All known early runic inscriptions are found in Germanic contexts with the potential exception of one inscription, which may indicate cultural transfer between the Germanic speakers to Slavic speakers (and may potentially be the earliest known writing among Slavic speakers) [m]\n\n\nRunic writing\nGermanic speakers developed a native script, the runes (or the fuþark), and the earliest known form of which

potential exception of one inscription, which may indicate cultural transfer between the Germanic speakers to Slavic speakers (and may potentially be the earliest known writing among Slavic speakers) [m]\n\n\nPersonal names\nGermanic personal names are commonly dithematic, consisting of two components that may be combined freely (such as the Old Norse female personal name Sigríðr, consisting of sigr 'victory' + fríðr 'beloved') As summarized by Per Vikstrand, \"The old Germanic personal names are, from a social and ideological point of view, characterized by three main features: religion, heroism, and family bonds The religious aspect  [of Germanic names] seems to be an inherited, Indo-European trace, which the Germanic languages share with Greek and other Indo-European languages.\" [310]\n\n\nPoetry and legend\nThe ancient Germanic-speaking peoples were a largely oral culture Written literature in Germanic languages is not recorded until the 6th century (Gothic Bible) or the 8th century in modern England and Germany [312] The philologist Andreas Heusler proposed the existence of various genres of literature in the \"Old Germanic\" period, which were largely based on genres found in high medieval Old Norse poetry These include ritual poetry, epigrammatic poetry (Spruchdichtung), memorial verses (Merkdichtung), lyric, narrative poetry, and praise poetry [313] Heinrich Beck suggests that, on the basis of Latin mentions in late antiquity and the early Middle Ages, the following genres can be adduced: origo gentis (the origin of a people or their rulers), the fall of heroes (casus heroici), praise poetry, and laments for the dead [314]\n\n\nGermanic law\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, the majority of scholars assumed the existence of a distinct Germanic legal culture and law [325] Early ideas about Germanic law have come under intense scholarly scrutiny since the 1950s, and specific aspects of it such as the legal importance of Sippe, retinues, and loyalty, and the concept of outlawry can no longer be justified [326] [327] Besides the assumption of a common Germanic legal tradition and the use of sources of different types from different places and time periods, [326] there are no native sources for early Germanic law [328] [329] The earliest written legal sources, the Leges Barbarorum, were all written under Roman and Christian influence and often with the help of Roman jurists, [330] and contain large amounts of \"Vulgar Latin Law\", an unofficial legal system that functioned in the Roman provinces [331]\n\n\nWarfare\nWarfare seems to have been a constant in Germanic society, [336] including conflicts among and within Germanic peoples [337] There is no common Germanic word for \"war\", and it was not necessarily differentiated from other forms of violence [338] Historical information on Germanic warfare almost entirely depends on Greco-Roman sources, [339] however their accuracy has been questioned [340] The core of the army was formed by the comitatus (retinue), a group of warriors following a chief [341] As retinues grew larger, their names could become associated with entire peoples Many retinues functioned as auxilia (mercenary units in the Roman army) [342]\n\n\nEconomy and material culture\nUnlike agriculture in the Roman provinces, which was organized around the large farms known as villae rusticae, Germanic agriculture was organized around villages When Germanic peoples expanded into northern Gaul in the 4th and 5th centuries CE, they brought this village-based agriculture with them, which increased the agricultural productivity of the land; Heiko Steuer suggests this means that Germania was more agriculturally productive than is generally assumed [351] Villages were not distant from each other but often within sight, revealing a fairly high population density, and contrary to the assertions of Roman sources, only about 30% of Germania was covered in forest, about the same percentage as today [352]\n\n\nAgriculture and population density\nUnlike agriculture in the Roman provinces, which was organized around the large farms known as villae rusticae, Germanic agriculture

[352]\n\n\nCrafts\nIt is unclear if there was a special class of craftsmen in Germania, however archaeological finds of tools are frequent [356] Many everyday items such as dishes were made out of wood, and archaeology has found the remains of wooden well construction [357] The 4th-century CE Nydam and Illerup ships show highly developed knowledge of ship construction, while elite graves have revealed wooden furniture with complex joinery [358] Products made from ceramics included cooking, drinking, and storage, vessels, as well as lamps While originally formed by hand, the period around 1 CE saw the introduction of the potter's wheel [359] Some of the ceramics produced on potter's wheels seem to have been done in direct imitation of Roman wares, [360] and may have been produced by Romans in Germania or by Germani who had learned Roman techniques while serving in the Roman army [361] The shape and decoration of Germanic ceramics vary by region and archaeologists have traditionally used these variations to determine larger cultural areas [362] Many ceramics were probably produced locally in hearths, but large pottery kilns have also been discovered, and it seems clear that there were areas of specialized production [360]\n\n\nMetalworking\nDespite the claims of Roman writers such as Tacitus that the Germani had little iron and lacked expertise in working it, deposits of iron were commonly found in Germania and Germanic smiths were skillful metalworkers [364] Smithies are known from multiple settlements, and smiths were often buried with their tools [365] An iron mine discovered at Rudki, in the Łysogóry mountains of modern central Poland, operated from the 1st to the 4th centuries CE and included a substantial smelting workshop; similar facilities have been found in Bohemia [366] The remains of large smelting operations have been discovered by Ribe in Jutland (4th to 6th century CE), [367] as well as at Glienick in northern Germany and at Heeten in the Netherlands (both 4th century CE) [368] Germanic smelting furnaces may have produced metal that was as high-quality as that produced by the Romans [369] In addition to large-scale production, nearly every individual settlement seems to have produced some iron for local use [367] Iron was used for agricultural tools, tools for various crafts, and for weapons [370]\n\n\nClothing and textiles\nClothing does not generally preserve well archaeologically Early Germanic clothing is shown on some Roman stone monuments such as Trajan's Column and the Column of Marcus Aurelius, and is occasionally discovered in finds from in moors, [380] mostly from Scandinavia [381] Frequent finds include long trousers, sometimes including connected stockings, shirt-like gowns (Kittel) with long sleeves, large pieces of cloth, and capes with fur on the inside [382] All of these are thought to be male clothing, while finds of tubular garments are thought to be female clothing These would have reached to the ankles and would likely have been held in place by brooches at the height of the shoulders, as shown on Roman monuments [383] On Roman depictions, the dress was gathered below the breast or at the waist, and there are frequently no sleeves Sometimes a blouse or skirt is depicted below the dress, along with a neckerchief around the throat [384] By the middle of the 5th century CE, both men and women among the continental Germanic peoples came to wear a Roman-style tunic as their most important piece of clothing This was secured at the waist and likely adopted due to intensive contact with the Roman world [385] The Romans typically depict Germanic men and women as bareheaded, although some head-coverings have been found Although Tacitus mentions an undergarment made of linen, no examples of these have been found [384]\n\n\nTrade\nArchaeology shows that from at least the turn of the 3rd century CE larger regional settlements in Germania existed that were not exclusively involved in an agrarian economy, and that the main settlements were connected by paved roads The entirety of Germania was within a system of long-distance trade [390] Migration-period seaborne trade is suggested by Gudme on the Danish island of Funen and other harbors on the Baltic [391]\n\n\nGenetics\nThe use of genetic studies to investigate the Germanic past is controversial, with scholars such as Guy Halsall suggesting it could represent a hearkening back to 19th-century ideas of race [402] Sebastian Brather, Wilhelm Heizmann, and Steffen Patzold write that genetics studies are of great use for demographic history, but cannot give us any information about cultural history [403] In a 2013 book which reviewed studies made up until then, scholars noted that most Germanic speakers today have a Y-DNA that is a mixture including haplogroup I1, R1a1a, R1b-P312 and R1b-U106; however, the authors also note that these groups are older than Germanic languages and found among speakers of other languages [404]\n\n\nModern reception\nThe rediscovery of Tacitus's Germania in the 1450s was used by German humanists to claim a glorious classical past for their nation that could compete with that of Greece and Rome, [405] and to equate the \"Germanic\" with the \"German\" [406] While the humanists' notion of the \"Germanic\" was initially vague, later it was narrowed and used to support a notion of German(ic) superiority to other nations [407] Equally important was Jordanes's Getica, rediscovered by Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini in the mid-15th century and first printed in 1515 by Konrad Peutinger, which depicted Scandinavia as the \"womb of nations\" (Latin: vagina nationum) from which all the historical northeastern European barbarians migrated in the distant past [408] While treated with suspicion by German scholars, who preferred the indigenous origin given by Tacitus, this motif became very popular in contemporary Swedish Gothicism, as it supported Sweden's imperial ambitions [409] Peutinger printed the Getica together with Paul the Deacon's History of the Lombards, so that the Germania, the Getica, and the History of the Lombards formed the basis for the study of the Germanic past [410] Scholars did not clearly differentiate between the Germanic peoples, Celtic peoples, and the \"Scythian peoples\" until the late 18th century with the discovery of Indo-European and the establishment of language as the primary criterion for nationality Before that time, German scholars considered the Celtic peoples to be part of the Germanic group [411]\n\n\nSee also\nClassical and medieval sources\n\n\nNotes\nClassical and medieval sources\n\n\nReferences\nClassical and medieval sources\n\n\nCitations\nClassical and medieval

{"title": "Vikram_(actor)", "content": "\nEarly life and family\nVikram was born as Kennedy John Victor on 17 April 1966 to a Tamil Christian father and a Tamil Hindu mother [6] His father, John Victor (alias Vinod Raj) was a native of Paramakudi who left his home to start a career in films, but worked only in minor roles Vikram's mother, Rajeshwari, was a government officer who reached the rank of sub-collector Rajeshwari was born in a Hindu family with film connections Her brother, Thiagarajan, is an established director-actor in the Tamil film industry; he is the father of actor Prashanth, making him Vikram's first cousin (although the two have never openly acknowledged this relationship) [7] Vikram has two siblings, both younger to him His brother, Arvind, appeared in the low-budget Tamil film, Eppo Kalyanam (2022) [8] [9] His sister, Anitha, is a teacher.\n\n\nActing career\nVikram began his professional career by modelling in advert films for brands including Chola Tea, TVS Excel and Alwyn watches as well as appearing in a six episode television serial titled Galatta Kudumbam, which aired between November and December 1988 During the final year of his M.B.A programme at Loyola College, he was recognised by the film industry, with veteran director C V Sridhar approaching him for a lead role in a film [16] Vikram made his film debut in 1990 by appearing in En Kadhal Kanmani, a small-budget love story featuring him alongside Rekha Nambiar, with Sridhar's Thanthu Vitten Ennai, opposite Rohini being his next release He then signed on to be a part of cinematographer P C Sriram's college love story Meera, with high expectations, however, the three films failed to launch his career [17] His appearances in Meera and in Kaaval Geetham, with another veteran director S P Muthuraman, helped him secure film offers from the Malayalam and Telugu film industries [16] In 1993, he almost signed on to appear in Mani Ratnam's Bombay and featured in the initial photo shoot alongside Manisha Koirala However, Mani Ratnam wanted Vikram to remove his beard for the role, and Vikram could not do so due to continuity problems with another film he had signed and hence was dropped from the project [18]\n\n\n1990–1998\nVikram began his professional career by modelling in advert films for brands including Chola Tea, TVS Excel and Alwyn watches as well as

Mani Ratnam wanted Vikram to remove his beard for the role, and Vikram could not do so due to continuity problems with another film he had signed and hence was dropped from the project [18]\n\n\n1999–2001\nIn 1999, he played the eponymous lead in debutant director Bala's romantic drama Sethu To prepare for the character, which was also referred to as Chiyaan, Vikram shaved his head, lost 21 kilograms and grew his nails long for the role [13] [24] After beginning production in April 1997, the film went through development hell after industry strikes and lack of funds hampered progress During this phase, he did not accept other acting offers to maintain the continuity of his looks The film then struggled to find a distributor, who shunned it due to the tragic climax and the film remained unreleased [10] [26] Vikram described the period of production as \"the worst phase of his career\" as he was financially strapped and \"his fire was in danger of dying down\" [24] He turned down an opportunity from a friend to take up a job in technology and attempted to stay in the industry by directing a serial titled Mounam Pesiyadhey, with Ameer as his assistant director [12] Sethu finally released in December 1999 and initially began running at a single noon show at a suburban theater, but gradually gained an audience through word-of-mouth publicity Eventually, it ran for over 100 days at several cinema halls across Chennai Vikram was constantly being mobbed by people on the streets as a result of the film's success [13] [17] Critics highly praised Vikram's performance with a reviewer referring to Vikram as \"a revelation\" and that \"he is very natural and his acting in last few scenes are just too good and could even be compared with the best we have seen\" [27] Similarly, a critic from the Malaysian daily New Straits Times, described the film as an \"unforgettable experience\" and described Vikram's performance as \"praise-worthy\" [28] The performance drew accolades with Vikram winning the Filmfare Special Award – South [29] and the Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize, in addition to his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil for his portrayal of the title character, while reports emerged that he missed out on the National Film Award for Best Actor by a single vote to Mohanlal [30] Post-Sethu, Vikram has said that the film would always remain close to him regardless of its commercial success and that it put him on the \"right path\", with Vikram choosing to adapt the prefix of Chiyaan to his screen name [24]\n\n\n2002–2003\nThe following year, Vikram went on to play the title role in Saran's Gemini, produced by AVM Productions, his first big-budget film in the Tamil industry, which featured him in the role of a local rowdy [42] The action film received positive reviews, with a critic citing that Vikram \"delivers a convincing performance\" and consequently became a \"box office triumph\" [37] [43] Similarly, the film's soundtrack composed by Bharadwaj had become popular prior to release, with Vikram also singing a version of the hit song \"O Podu!\" for the album [44] Balaji Sakthivel's Samurai was his next release, featuring him as a vigilante Robin Hood-esque figure who kidnapped corrupt politicians Vikram had signed the film in early 2000 and the film was on hold during production, leading to a two-year delay and the film finally opened to average reviews and box office collections The critic from The Hindu gave praise for Vikram's \"admirably well-maintained physique and powerful eyes\", whilst another labelled that the film's single major positive was Vikram's convincing portrayal [45] [46] His final release of the year was Prabhu Solomon's King, a drama film which featured him alongside Sneha and Nassar Vikram played Raja, a magician, who is unaware that he has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, with his family trying to keep the truth away from him The film also met with an unfavorable response commercially, but received positive reviews from critics [47]\n\n\n2003–2009\nThe success of Dharani's Dhill resulted in the film's team collaborating to make a film in a similar genre; Dhool, which also featured Jyothika, Reemma Sen and Vivek [40] The film saw Vikram play Aarumugham, a villager, who comes to the city seeking help in regard to a water crisis back home, but subsequently ends up tackling the corrupt politicians who are behind the water scam In regard to his performance, the Rediff.com review praised his enactment, citing that \"Vikram is at his peak\" and that \"he seems as much at home with comedy as with action, in romance as in emotional sequences\", while the critic from The Hindu also praised his performance [48] [49] The film became a blockbuster and his fifth success in two and a half years, with Vikram being dubbed as \"the matinee idol of our times\" by a leading Indian newspaper [50] He also featured in the romantic film Kadhal Sadugudu, with Priyanka Trivedi which was a critical and commercial failure, with reviewers claiming that \"there are times you wish Vikram were a little more brisk and dynamic\" in regard to his performance [51] After release, Vikram was critical of the film's failure, confessing that the story \"underwent a lot of changes after the initial narration\", lamenting that he was \"taken for a royal ride\" by the producers [52]\n\n\n2010–2014\nVikram then featured in Mani Ratnam's bilingual films Raavanan and Raavan, inspired by the ancient Sanskrit epic Ramayana, with Vikram featuring as the tribal leader, Veeraiya, in the Tamil version and the cop, Dev Pratap Sharma, in the Hindi version of the films, which were shot simultaneously [77] Vikram revealed that changes between the two characters during filming took up to 45 minutes, with Abhishek Bachchan playing the tribal leader in the Hindi version, whilst Prithviraj played the cop in the Tamil version, with Aishwarya Rai as the female lead [14] Vikram was initially apprehensive, because both roles were to be shot almost simultaneously, but revealed that he succeeded by showing differences in his body language and expressions [78] [79] Vikram revealed that he and Abhishek Bachchan played the roles in the respective versions without inspiration from one another Despite being a non-speaker and making his debut in Hindi, he dubbed his lines in the language, remarking jovially that it was the \"most difficult thing in the world\" [80] After promotions at the Cannes Film Festival and a premiere at Leicester Square in London, the two versions and the dubbed Telugu version released simultaneously in 2,200 screens worldwide and took a big opening on day one, earning 200 million [81] [82] The Tamil version, Raavanan won rave reviews from critics, with The Hindu calling it a \"master-stroke\" and claiming that Vikram \"raises the bar higher with every venture\" The critic cited that \"emotions of love, animus, anguish and joy dance on his face in quick succession\", concluding that \"Vikram lifts the role to an admirable level\" [83] The critic from Sify labelled it as an \"astonishing portrayal\", while the critic from the Hindustan Times praised Vikram's \"ability to get into Veeraiya's skin and emote with conviction\" [84] The Tamil version emerged as a commercial success, with Vikram's performance winning him his fourth Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil among other accolades [85] In contrast, the Hindi version fetched mixed reviews, with critics agreeing that Vikram's performance as the tribal leader was more convincing than Bachchan's Baradwaj Rangan, writing for The New Indian Express rated the film 4/5 and said: \"Raavan falls for Sita (and vice versa) in an intriguingly idiosyncratic take on the Ramayana – if you can get past the lead performances, that is\" [86] Whereas, Taran Adarsh, writing for Bollywood Hungama rated it 1+1⁄2 out of 5 and said: \"On the whole, Raavan is a king-sized disappointment, in terms of content\" though mentioning that Vikram was \"first-rate, although the role isn't substantial enough\" [87] Raavan subsequently went on to become a surprise flop at the Indian box office [88] The film was also screened at the Venice Film Festival and the Busan International Film Festival, with Vikram in attendance [89]\n\n\n2015–present\nVikram signed on to collaborate again with Shankar for I, a romantic thriller opposite Amy Jackson, in early 2012 [105] Following hushed production developments, it was revealed that the actor would sport four significantly different looks in the film: a body builder, a beast, a model and a hunchback He put on weight to portray the bodybuilder, sticking to a diet of protein and coffee, to ensure his muscles were defined on screen Vikram subsequently lost weight to portray a model, before shaving his head and reducing his weight to 56 kilograms to portray the crippled hunchback [106] He changed his physique by eating small meals of egg whites and apples instead of regular food intake, while engaging in an intensive weight loss regimen to become thin The cast and crew of the film reportedly struggled to recognise the actor at times, while he also stayed away from the media for close to a year when sporting the look [107] Taking almost three years for production, Vikram described the film \"as the toughest he has ever done\" and regularly suffered folliculitis as a result of the prosthetic make-up he had to wear [12] The film opened amidst much expectation in January 2015 to mixed reviews, though Vikram's portrayal of Lingesan received highly positive reviews A critic from The Times of India noted: \"Vikram bowls you over with a heart-wrenching performance whether he is handsome or disfigured\", while The Hindu added his transformation was \"laudable\", and that \"Vikram wins hearts as the earnest-to-boot gym rat and as the strapping new model on the block, he floors the audience with his performance as Koonan, the deformed hunchback\" [108] [109] Similarly, Rediff.com noted the actor \"is truly impressive and deserves much applause\", while Sify.com added he \"lived the role\" [110] [111] Despite the mixed critical reception, I performed well at the box office, as well as becoming the most successful Tamil film of all time in Kerala [112] By early 2015, it was the sixth highest-grossing Tamil film of all time at the time [113] [114] I won Vikram his fifth Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil.\n\n\nOther work\nApart from acting, Vikram has also been a part of other film-making processes with credits as a playback singer and as an assistant director In 2000, Vikram and actress Meena launched a pop album titled Kadhalism, which the pair would sing and appear in music videos for, although the project was completed without much promotion [127] Following the success of Bharadwaj's music for Vikram's 2002 film Gemini, Vikram sang a version of the hit song \"O Podu!\" for the extended version of the album [44] During the making of Kanthaswamy in 2009, the music composer Devi Sri Prasad had asked Vikram to sing a few rough tracks during the film's song composition in Malaysia The producers were impressed with his voice and Vikram ended up singing four songs in the film [128] Furthermore, Vikram also recorded all four tracks in the Telugu version of the album titled Mallana [129] He then went on to sing for a film he was unrelated to, by lending five different voices in \"Meghame\" for G V Prakash Kumar's album in Madrasapattinam [130] He sang two further songs under Prakash Kumar for his Deiva Thirumagal, singing in the voice of his character, an adult with the maturity of a six-year-old [131] In 2011, he sang the song \"Laddu Laddu\" for his film Rajapattai, under composer Yuvan Shankar Raja's direction [132] Vikram announced his own production company Reel Life Entertainment in July 2009 and announced that Sasikumar would direct his first film, the action thriller Easan, featuring Samudrakani, Vaibhav, Abhinaya and Aparnaa Bajpai [133] However, after 90% of the shoot had been completed, Vikram pulled out of the venture, citing that Sasikumar had overshot his budget and the director eventually bought and released the film [134] The actor, however, was later listed as one of the three producers for the Tamil version of the 2013 film, David, thereby making his debut in film financing Vikram has also worked as the assistant director under Shafi in Majaa, and has mentioned that he would like to direct a film in the future [66]\n\n\nFilm and television work\nApart from acting, Vikram has also been a part of other film-making processes with

children and rehabilitate victims from natural disasters Every year, Vikram has celebrated his birthday doing charity work across Tamil Nadu and in 2008, he organised a camp where a thousand of his fans pledged their eyes in an eye donation appeal [136]\n\n\nIn the media\nVikram is a prolific method actor, being often compared akin to Hollywood's Christian Bale Since the success of Sethu, Vikram's intense performances and variety of roles have received critical acclaim [141] His performances as a rogue turned mentally ill patient in Sethu, a gravedigger with autism spectrum disorder in Bala's Pithamagan, a Brahmin lawyer with multiple personality disorder in Anniyan and a mentally challenged adult with the maturity of a six-year-old boy in Deiva Thirumagal are all roles in which he played a mentally affected man, with Vikram mentioning that he does such roles to reinvent himself on screen [142]\n\n\nPersonal life\nVikram met Shailaja Balakrishnan in the late 1980s and married

"**Vikram (actor)**\n\nVikram is a renowned Indian film actor, producer, and playback singer who predominantly works in the Tamil film industry. Born to a Tamil Christian father and a Tamil Hindu mother, he made his film debut in 1990 and has since established himself as a versatile and accomplished actor.\n\n**Early Life and Family**\n\nVikram was born on 17 April 1966 in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, to John Victor (alias Vinod Raj) and Rajeshwari. His father, John Victor, was a native of Paramakudi who left his home to start a career in films, but worked only in minor roles. Vikram's mother, Rajeshwari, was a government officer who reached the rank of sub-collector. She was born in a Hindu family with film connections, and her brother, Thiagarajan, is an established director-actor in the Tamil film industry. Thiagarajan is the father of actor Prashanth, making him Vikram's first cousin, although the two have never openly acknowledged this relationship.\n\nVikram has two siblings, both younger than him. His brother, Arvind, appeared in the low-budget Tamil film, Eppo Kalyanam (2022).

He also featured in the romantic film Kadhal Sadugudu, which was a critical and commercial failure.\n\n**2010-2014**\n\nVikram then featured in Mani Ratnam's bilingual films Raavanan and Raavan, inspired by the ancient Sanskrit epic Ramayana. Vikram revealed that changes between the two characters during filming took up to 45 minutes, with Abhishek Bachchan playing the tribal leader in the Hindi version, and Prithviraj playing the cop in the Tamil version, with Aishwarya Rai as the female lead. Vikram was initially apprehensive, but revealed that he succeeded by showing differences in his body language and expressions. The films released simultaneously in 2,200 screens worldwide and took a big opening on day one, earning 200 million. The Tamil version, Raavanan, won rave reviews from critics, with The Hindu calling it a \"master-stroke\" and claiming that Vikram \"raises the bar higher with every venture.\" The critic cited that \"emotions of love, animus, anguish, and joy dance on his face in quick succession,\" concluding that \"Vikram lifts the role to an admirable level.\" The film emerged as a commercial success, and Vikram's performance won him his fourth Filmfare Award for Best Actor - Tamil.\n\n**2015-Present**\n\nVikram signed on to collaborate again with Shankar for I, a romantic thriller opposite Amy Jackson, in early 2012. He put on weight to portray a bodybuilder, and then lost weight to portray a model. He shaved his head and reduced his weight to 56 kilograms to portray the crippled hunchback. The film opened amidst much expectation in January 2015 to mixed reviews, though Vikram's portrayal of Lingesan received highly positive reviews. The film performed well at the box office and became the most successful Tamil film of all time in Kerala.\n\n**Other Work**\n\nApart from acting, Vikram has also been a part of other film-making processes with credits as a playback singer and as an assistant director. In 2000, Vikram and actress Meena launched a pop album titled Kadhalism, which the pair would sing and appear in music videos for, although the project was completed without much promotion. Vikram sang a version of the hit song \"O Podu!\" for the extended version of the album. During the making of Kanthaswamy in 2009, the music composer Devi Sri Prasad had asked Vikram to sing a few rough tracks during the film's song composition in Malaysia. Vikram ended up singing four songs in the film.\n\n**Philanthropy**\n\nVikram has promoted various social causes with several of his charity works being linked to characters he had portrayed in his films. He has been a brand ambassador of Sanjeevani Trust and a school for special children Vidya Sudha, where he stayed during the making of Deiva Thirumagal. Vikram has also set up The Vikram Foundation through his fan club to provide heart operations for the poor, educate poor children, and rehabilitate victims from natural disasters. Every year, Vikram has celebrated his birthday doing charity work across Tamil Nadu and in 2008, he organised a camp where a thousand of his fans pledged their eyes in an eye donation appeal.\n\n**In the Media**\n\nVikram is a prolific method actor, being often compared akin to Hollywood's Christian Bale. Since the success of Sethu, Vikram's intense performances and variety of roles have received critical acclaim. His performances as a rogue turned mentally ill patient in Sethu, a gravedigger with autism spectrum disorder in Bala's Pithamagan, a Brahmin lawyer with multiple personality disorder in Anniyan, and a mentally challenged adult with the maturity of a six-year-old boy in Deiva Thirumagal are all roles in which he played a mentally affected man, with Vikram mentioning that he does such roles to reinvent himself on screen.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nVikram met Shailaja Balakrishnan in the late 1980s and married her in 1992 at Guruvayoor Temple in a mass wedding alongside dozens of couples. The pair then had a low-key wedding ceremony conducted at the church at Loyola College, Chennai. Shailaja hails from Thalassery, Kerala and now works as a psychology teacher at a leading Chennai school. Shailaja also worked with the team of Deiva Thirumagal by giving professional advice on how people with special needs are treated and helping develop the character played by Vikram.\n\n**Awards and Nominations**\n\n* Filmfare Special Award - South for Sethu (2000)\n* Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize for Sethu (2000)\n* Filmfare Award for Best Actor - Tamil for Raavanan (2010)\n* Filmfare Award for Best Actor - Tamil for I (2015)\n\n**Discography**\n\n* Kadhalism (2000)\n* O Podu!

Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Vikram_(actor)\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and family\nVikram was born as Kennedy John Victor on 17 April 1966 to a Tamil Christian father and a Tamil Hindu mother [6] His father, John Victor (alias Vinod Raj) was a native of Paramakudi who left his home to start a career in films, but worked only in minor roles Vikram's mother, Rajeshwari, was a government officer who reached the rank of sub-collector Rajeshwari was born in a Hindu family with film connections Her brother, Thiagarajan, is an established director-actor in the Tamil film industry; he is the father of actor Prashanth, making him Vikram's first cousin (although the two have never openly acknowledged this relationship) [7] Vikram has two siblings, both younger to him His brother, Arvind, appeared in the low-budget Tamil film, Eppo Kalyanam (2022) [8] [9] His sister, Anitha, is a teacher.\n\n\nActing career\nVikram began his professional career by modelling in advert films for brands including Chola Tea, TVS Excel and Alwyn watches as well as appearing in a six episode television serial titled Galatta Kudumbam, which aired between November and December 1988 During the final year of his M.B.A programme at Loyola College, he was recognised by the film industry, with veteran director C V Sridhar approaching him for a lead role in a film [16] Vikram made his film debut in 1990 by appearing in En Kadhal Kanmani, a small-budget love story featuring him alongside Rekha Nambiar, with Sridhar's Thanthu Vitten Ennai, opposite Rohini being his next release He then signed on to be a part of cinematographer P C Sriram's college love story Meera, with high expectations, however, the three films failed to launch his career [17] His appearances in Meera and in Kaaval Geetham, with another veteran director S P Muthuraman, helped him secure film offers from the Malayalam and Telugu film industries [16] In 1993, he almost signed on to appear in Mani Ratnam's Bombay and featured in the initial photo shoot alongside Manisha Koirala However, Mani Ratnam wanted Vikram to remove his beard for the role, and Vikram could not do so due to continuity problems with another film he had signed and hence was dropped from the project [18]\n\n\n1990–1998\nVikram began his professional career by modelling in advert films for brands including Chola Tea, TVS Excel and

dropped from the project [18]\n\n\n1999–2001\nIn 1999, he played the eponymous lead in debutant director Bala's romantic drama Sethu To prepare for the character, which was also referred to as Chiyaan, Vikram shaved his head, lost 21 kilograms and grew his nails long for the role [13] [24] After beginning production in April 1997, the film went through development hell after industry strikes and lack of funds hampered progress During this phase, he did not accept other acting offers to maintain the continuity of his looks The film then struggled to find a distributor, who shunned it due to the tragic climax and the film remained unreleased [10] [26] Vikram described the period of production as \"the worst phase of his career\" as he was financially strapped and \"his fire was in danger of dying down\" [24] He turned down an opportunity from a friend to take up a job in technology and attempted to stay in the industry by directing a serial titled Mounam Pesiyadhey, with Ameer as his assistant director [12] Sethu finally released in December 1999 and initially began running at a single noon show at a suburban theater, but gradually gained an audience through word-of-mouth publicity Eventually, it ran for over 100 days at several cinema halls across Chennai Vikram was constantly being mobbed by people on the streets as a result of the film's success [13] [17] Critics highly praised Vikram's performance with a reviewer referring to Vikram as \"a revelation\" and that \"he is very natural and his acting in last few scenes are just too good and could even be compared with the best we have seen\" [27] Similarly, a critic from the Malaysian daily New Straits Times, described the film as an \"unforgettable experience\" and described Vikram's performance as \"praise-worthy\" [28] The performance drew accolades with Vikram winning the Filmfare Special Award – South [29] and the Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize, in addition to his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil for his portrayal of the title character, while reports emerged that he missed out on the National Film Award for Best Actor by a single vote to Mohanlal [30] Post-Sethu, Vikram has said that the film would always remain close to him regardless of its commercial success and that it put him on the \"right path\", with Vikram choosing to adapt the prefix of Chiyaan to his screen name [24]\n\n\n2002–2003\nThe following year, Vikram went on to play the title role in Saran's Gemini, produced by AVM Productions, his first big-budget film in the Tamil industry, which featured him in the role of a local rowdy [42] The action film received positive reviews, with a critic citing that Vikram \"delivers a convincing performance\" and consequently became a \"box office triumph\" [37] [43] Similarly, the film's soundtrack composed by Bharadwaj had become popular prior to release, with Vikram also singing a version of the hit song \"O Podu!\" for the album [44] Balaji Sakthivel's Samurai was his next release, featuring him as a vigilante Robin Hood-esque figure who kidnapped corrupt politicians Vikram had signed the film in early 2000 and the film was on hold during production, leading to a two-year delay and the film finally opened to average reviews and box office collections The critic from The Hindu gave praise for Vikram's \"admirably well-maintained physique and powerful eyes\", whilst another labelled that the film's single major positive was Vikram's convincing portrayal [45] [46] His final release of the year was Prabhu Solomon's King, a drama film which featured him alongside Sneha and Nassar Vikram played Raja, a magician, who is unaware that he has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, with his family trying to keep the truth away from him The film also met with an unfavorable response commercially, but received positive reviews from critics [47]\n\n\n2003–2009\nThe success of Dharani's Dhill resulted in the film's team collaborating to make a film in a similar genre; Dhool, which also featured Jyothika, Reemma Sen and Vivek [40] The film saw Vikram play Aarumugham, a villager, who comes to the city seeking help in regard to a water crisis back home, but subsequently ends up tackling the corrupt politicians who are behind the water scam In regard to his performance, the Rediff.com review praised his enactment, citing that \"Vikram is at his peak\" and that \"he seems as much at home with comedy as with action, in romance as in emotional sequences\", while the critic from The Hindu also praised his performance [48] [49] The film became a blockbuster and his fifth success in two and a half years, with Vikram being dubbed as \"the matinee idol of our times\" by a leading Indian newspaper [50] He also featured in the romantic film Kadhal Sadugudu, with Priyanka Trivedi which was a critical and commercial failure, with reviewers claiming that \"there are times you wish Vikram were a little more brisk and dynamic\" in regard to his performance [51] After release, Vikram was critical of the film's failure, confessing that the story \"underwent a lot of changes after the initial narration\", lamenting that he was \"taken for a royal ride\" by the producers [52]\n\n\n2010–2014\nVikram then featured in Mani Ratnam's bilingual films Raavanan and Raavan, inspired by the ancient Sanskrit epic Ramayana, with Vikram featuring as the tribal leader, Veeraiya, in the Tamil version and the cop, Dev Pratap Sharma, in the Hindi version of the films, which were shot simultaneously [77] Vikram revealed that changes between the two characters during filming took up to 45 minutes, with Abhishek Bachchan playing the tribal leader in the Hindi version, whilst Prithviraj played the cop in the Tamil version, with Aishwarya Rai as the female lead [14] Vikram was initially apprehensive, because both roles were to be shot almost simultaneously, but revealed that he succeeded by showing differences in his body language and expressions [78] [79] Vikram revealed that he and Abhishek Bachchan played the roles in the respective versions without inspiration from one another Despite being a non-speaker and making his debut in Hindi, he dubbed his lines in the language, remarking jovially that it was the \"most difficult thing in the world\" [80] After promotions at the Cannes Film Festival and a premiere at Leicester Square in London, the two versions and the dubbed Telugu version released simultaneously in 2,200 screens worldwide and took a big opening on day one, earning 200 million [81] [82] The Tamil version, Raavanan won rave reviews from critics, with The Hindu calling it a \"master-stroke\" and claiming that Vikram \"raises the bar higher with every venture\" The critic cited that \"emotions of love, animus, anguish and joy dance on his face in quick succession\", concluding that \"Vikram lifts the role to an admirable level\" [83] The critic from Sify labelled it as an \"astonishing portrayal\", while the critic from the Hindustan Times praised Vikram's \"ability to get into Veeraiya's skin and emote with conviction\" [84] The Tamil version emerged as a commercial success, with Vikram's performance winning him his fourth Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil among other accolades [85] In contrast, the Hindi version fetched mixed reviews, with critics agreeing that Vikram's performance as the tribal leader was more convincing than Bachchan's Baradwaj Rangan, writing for The New Indian Express rated the film 4/5 and said: \"Raavan falls for Sita (and vice versa) in an intriguingly idiosyncratic take on the Ramayana – if you can get past the lead performances, that is\" [86] Whereas, Taran Adarsh, writing for Bollywood Hungama rated it 1+1⁄2 out of 5 and said: \"On the whole, Raavan is a king-sized disappointment, in terms of content\" though mentioning that Vikram was \"first-rate, although the role isn't substantial enough\" [87] Raavan subsequently went on to become a surprise flop at the Indian box office [88] The film was also screened at the Venice Film Festival and the Busan International Film Festival, with Vikram in attendance [89]\n\n\n2015–present\nVikram signed on to collaborate again with Shankar for I, a romantic thriller opposite Amy Jackson, in early 2012 [105] Following hushed production developments, it was revealed that the actor would sport four significantly different looks in the film: a body builder, a beast, a model and a hunchback He put on weight to portray the bodybuilder, sticking to a diet of protein and coffee, to ensure his muscles were defined on screen Vikram subsequently lost weight to portray a model, before shaving his head and reducing his weight to 56 kilograms to portray the crippled hunchback [106] He changed his physique by eating small meals of egg whites and apples instead of regular food intake, while engaging in an intensive weight loss regimen to become thin The cast and crew of the film reportedly struggled to recognise the actor at times, while he also stayed away from the media for close to a year when sporting the look [107] Taking almost three years for production, Vikram described the film \"as the toughest he has ever done\" and regularly suffered folliculitis as a result of the prosthetic make-up he had to wear [12] The film opened amidst much expectation in January 2015 to mixed reviews, though Vikram's portrayal of Lingesan received highly positive reviews A critic from The Times of India noted: \"Vikram bowls you over with a heart-wrenching performance whether he is handsome or disfigured\", while The Hindu added his transformation was \"laudable\", and that \"Vikram wins hearts as the earnest-to-boot gym rat and as the strapping new model on the block, he floors the audience with his performance as Koonan, the deformed hunchback\" [108] [109] Similarly, Rediff.com noted the actor \"is truly impressive and deserves much applause\", while Sify.com added he \"lived the role\" [110] [111] Despite the mixed critical reception, I performed well at the box office, as well as becoming the most successful Tamil film of all time in Kerala [112] By early 2015, it was the sixth highest-grossing Tamil film of all time at the time [113] [114] I won Vikram his fifth Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil.\n\n\nOther work\nApart from acting, Vikram has also been a part of other film-making processes with credits as a playback singer and as an assistant director In 2000, Vikram and

adult with the maturity of a six-year-old [131] In 2011, he sang the song \"Laddu Laddu\" for his film Rajapattai, under composer Yuvan Shankar Raja's direction [132] Vikram announced his own production company Reel Life Entertainment in July 2009 and announced that Sasikumar would direct his first film, the action thriller Easan, featuring Samudrakani, Vaibhav, Abhinaya and Aparnaa Bajpai [133] However, after 90% of the shoot had been completed, Vikram pulled out of the venture, citing that Sasikumar had overshot his budget and the director eventually bought and released the film [134] The actor, however, was later listed as one of the three producers for the Tamil version of the 2013 film, David, thereby making his debut in film financing Vikram has also worked as the assistant director under Shafi in Majaa, and has mentioned that he would like to direct a film in the future [66]\n\n\nFilm and television work\nApart from acting, Vikram has also been a part of other

a deal made in the 1970s, were separate from her case and still ongoing [53]\n\n\n1971 arms deal dispute\nIn February 2018, Richard Ratcliffe said he believed his wife's release was dependent on the interest on a £450 million debt the UK has owed to Iran since the 1970s for a cancelled arms deal [54] [55] In October 2019 he repeated the claim with more detail, stating that a UK government agency

[78]\n\n\nUnited Nations\nThe United Nations has on several occasions called for Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release On 7 October 2016, the United Nations rapporteur on human rights in Iran, Ahmed Shaheed,

protection even if they are being tortured [93] [94] However, in normal circumstances, British citizens abroad are eligible for consular assistance in times of need [95] The legal difficulty for the British Foreign Office in this particular case is that Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in the country of her birth citizenship and in a country which does not recognise dual nationality for Iranian citizens Furthermore, during her visits to Iran, Zaghari-Ratcliffe entered the country using her Iranian passport [1] The FCDO have acknowledged the risk to dual nationals of arrest and detention in

The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention had also formally called for her immediate release in its Opinion 28/2016, adopted in August 2016.\n\n**Coronavirus Pandemic**\n\nIn February 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic spread to Iran, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was suspected of falling ill with COVID-19 from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Her family called on the UK and Iranian governments to ensure that Zaghari-Ratcliffe was tested for the virus and received proper medical treatment. However, Iran's judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili said she did not have coronavirus and was in \"good health.\" Gholamhossein also described reports of her infection as \"propaganda.\"\n\n**Consular Assistance**\n\nIn December 2020, in relation to Zaghari-Ratcliffe's imprisonment, it was widely reported that British citizens arrested abroad do not have a right to government help or protection even if they are being tortured. However, in normal circumstances, British citizens abroad are eligible for consular assistance in times of need. The legal difficulty for the British Foreign Office in this particular case is that Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in the country of her birth citizenship and in a country which does not recognise dual nationality for Iranian citizens. Furthermore, during her visits to Iran, Zaghari-Ratcliffe entered the country using her Iranian passport. The FCDO have acknowledged the risk to dual nationals of arrest and detention in its travel advice to persons travelling to Iran.\n\n**Release**\n\nZaghari-Ratcliffe was released, together with Anoosheh Ashoori, on 16 March 2022. Boarding a Royal Air Force of Oman plane, the pair arrived in Muscat that day and returned to the United Kingdom the next day in a government-chartered flight to RAF Brize Norton. Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family stayed their first few days at Dorneywood, a government grace-and-favour country house.\n\n**Mahsa Amini Protests**\n\nBecause of the Mahsa Amini protests, Zaghari-Ratcliffe cut her hair publicly as a symbol of opposition to tyranny in the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\n**Media**\n\nOn 28 December 2022, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was the guest editor on the Today (BBC Radio 4) programme. She told Andy Murray that had she had experienced a rare moment of joy during her imprisonment when her captors gave her a television, on which she saw him win the Men's singles at the 2016 Wimbledon

in Australia on a US extradition warrant Britain rejected a prisoner-swap proposal by Iran's foreign minister, calling it a \"vile\" diplomatic manoeuvre [50] [51] An Iranian state TV report quoted an anonymous Iran official on 2 May 2021 as stating that the United Kingdom had agreed to settle its debt of £400 million in return for her release [52] The British government denied this the next day, saying the negotiations about the debt, accrued due to it not delivering tanks to Iran as agreed in a deal made in the 1970s, were separate from her case and still ongoing [53]\n\n\n1971 arms deal dispute\nIn February 2018, Richard Ratcliffe said he believed his wife's release was dependent on the interest on a £450 million debt the UK has owed to Iran since the 1970s for a cancelled arms deal

defence was that she was there on a holiday and never worked to train journalists in the country [75] [76] However, on 1 November 2017, the then-British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said \"When we look at what Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was doing, she was simply teaching people journalism, as I understand it, at the very limit.\" [77] These remarks appeared to have put her at risk, [76] prompting condemnation from Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, who called for Johnson to be sacked [78]\n\n\nUnited Nations\nThe United Nations has on several occasions called for Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release On 7 October 2016, the United Nations rapporteur on human rights in Iran, Ahmed Shaheed, called on Iran to immediately release Zaghari-Ratcliffe [85] The call was repeated

and its millet system offered non-Muslims a subordinate but protected place in society [9] Sharia law encoded Islamic superiority but guaranteed property rights and freedom of worship to non-Muslims (dhimmis) in exchange for a special tax [10]\n\n\nLand conflict and reforms\nArmenians in the eastern provinces lived in semi-feudal conditions and commonly encountered forced labor, illegal taxation, and unpunished crimes against them including robberies, murders, and sexual assaults [13] [14] Beginning in 1839, the Ottoman government issued a series of reforms to centralize power and equalize the status of Ottoman subjects regardless of religion The reforms to equalize the status of non-Muslims were strongly opposed by Islamic clergy and Muslims in general, and remained mostly theoretical [15] [16] [17] Because of the abolition of the Kurdish emirates in the mid-nineteenth century, the Ottoman government began to directly tax Armenian peasants who had previously paid taxes only to Kurdish landlords The latter continued to exact levies illegally [18] [19]\n\n\nYoung Turk Revolution\nAbdul Hamid's despotism prompted the formation of an opposition movement, the Young Turks, which sought to overthrow him and restore the 1876 Constitution of the Ottoman Empire, which he had suspended in 1877 [42] One faction of the Young Turks was the secret and revolutionary Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), based in Salonica, from which the charismatic conspirator Mehmed Talaat (later Talaat Pasha [b]) emerged as a leading member [44] Although skeptical of a growing, exclusionary Turkish nationalism in the Young Turk movement, the ARF decided to ally with the CUP in December 1907 [45] [46] In 1908, the CUP came to power in the Young Turk Revolution, which began with a string of CUP assassinations of leading officials in Macedonia [47] [48] Abdul Hamid was forced to reinstate the 1876 constitution and restore the Ottoman parliament, which was celebrated by Ottomans of all ethnicities and religions [49] [50] Security improved in parts of the eastern provinces after 1908 and the CUP took steps to reform the local gendarmerie, [51] although tensions remained high [52] Despite an agreement to reverse the land usurpation of the previous decades in the 1910 Salonica Accord between the ARF and the CUP, the latter made no efforts to carry this out [53] [54]\n\n\nBalkan Wars\nThe 1912 First Balkan War resulted in the loss of almost all of the empire's European territory [65] and the mass expulsion of Muslims from the Balkans [66] Ottoman Muslim society was incensed by the atrocities committed against Balkan Muslims, intensifying anti-Christian sentiment and leading to a desire for revenge [67] [68] Blame for the loss was assigned to all Christians, including the Ottoman Armenians, many of whom had fought on the Ottoman side [69] The Balkan Wars put an end to the Ottomanist movement for pluralism and coexistence; [70] instead, the CUP turned to an increasingly radical Turkish nationalism to preserve the empire [71] CUP leaders such as Talaat and Enver Pasha came to blame non-Muslim population concentrations in strategic areas for many of the empire's problems, concluding by mid-1914 that they were internal tumors to be excised [72] Of these, Ottoman Armenians were considered the most dangerous, because CUP leaders feared that their homeland in Anatolia—claimed as the last refuge of the Turkish nation—would break away from the empire as the Balkans had [73] [74] [71]\n\n\nOttoman entry into World War I\nA few days after the outbreak of World War I, the CUP concluded an alliance with Germany on 2 August 1914 [83] The same month, CUP representatives went to an ARF conference demanding that, in the event of war with Russia, the ARF incite Russian Armenians to intervene on the Ottoman side Instead, the delegates resolved that Armenians should fight for the countries of their citizenships [84] During its war preparations, the Ottoman government recruited thousands of prisoners to join the paramilitary Special Organization, [85] which initially focused on stirring up revolts among Muslims behind Russian lines beginning before the empire officially entered the war [86] On 29 October 1914, the empire entered World War I on the side of the Central Powers by launching a surprise attack on Russian ports in the Black Sea [87] Many Russian Armenians were enthusiastic about the war, but Ottoman Armenians were more ambivalent, afraid that supporting Russia would bring retaliation Organization of Armenian volunteer units by Russian Armenians, later joined by some Ottoman Armenian deserters, further increased Ottoman suspicions against their Armenian population [88]\n\n\nOnset of genocide\nMinister of War Enver Pasha took over command of the Ottoman armies for the invasion of Russian territory, and tried to encircle the Russian Caucasus Army at the Battle of Sarikamish, fought from December 1914 to January 1915 Unprepared for the harsh winter conditions, [100] his forces were routed, losing more than 60,000 men [101] The retreating Ottoman army destroyed dozens of Ottoman Armenian villages in Bitlis vilayet, massacring their inhabitants [97] Enver publicly blamed his defeat on Armenians who he claimed had actively sided with the Russians, a theory that became a consensus among CUP leaders [102] [103] Reports of local incidents such as weapons caches, severed telegraph lines, and occasional killings confirmed preexisting beliefs about Armenian treachery and fueled paranoia among CUP leaders that a coordinated Armenian conspiracy was plotting against the empire [104] [105] Discounting contrary reports that most Armenians were loyal, the CUP leaders decided that the Armenians had to be eliminated to save the empire [104]\n\n\nSystematic deportations\nWe have been blamed for not making a distinction between guilty and innocent Armenians  [To do so] was impossible Because of the nature of things, one who was still innocent today could be guilty tomorrow The concern for the safety of Turkey simply had to silence all other concerns.\n\n\nAims\nWe have been blamed for not making a distinction between guilty and innocent Armenians  [To do so] was impossible Because of the nature of things, one who was still innocent today could be guilty tomorrow The concern for the safety of Turkey simply had to silence all other concerns.\n\n\nAdministrative organization\nOn 23 May 1915, Talaat ordered the deportation of all Armenians in Van, Bitlis, and Erzerum [150] [151] To grant a cover of legality to the deportation, already well underway in the eastern provinces and Cilicia, the Council of Ministers approved the Temporary Law of Deportation, which allowed authorities to deport anyone deemed suspect [151] [152] [153] On 21 June, Talaat ordered the deportation of all Armenians throughout the empire, even Adrianople, 2,000 kilometers (1,200 mi) from the Russian front [154] Following the elimination of the Armenian population in eastern Anatolia, in August 1915, the Armenians of western Anatolia and European Turkey were targeted for deportation Some areas with a very low Armenian population and some cities, including Constantinople, were partially spared [155] [156]\n\n\nDeath marches\nAlthough the majority of able-bodied Armenian men had been conscripted into the army, others deserted, paid the exemption tax, or fell outside the age range of conscription Unlike the earlier massacres of Ottoman Armenians, in 1915 Armenians were not usually killed in their villages, to avoid destruction of property or unauthorized looting Instead, the men were usually separated from the rest of the deportees during the first few days and executed Few resisted, believing it would put their families in greater danger [161] Boys above the age of twelve (sometimes fifteen) were treated as adult men [172] Execution sites were chosen for proximity to major roads and for rugged terrain, lakes, wells, or cisterns to facilitate the concealment or disposal of corpses [171] [173] [174] The convoys would stop at a nearby transit camp, where the escorts would demand a ransom from the Armenians Those unable to pay were murdered [161] Units of the Special Organization, often wearing gendarme uniforms, were stationed at the killing sites; escorting gendarmes often did not participate in killing [174]\n\n\nIslamization\nThe Islamization of Armenians, carried out as a systematic state policy involving the bureaucracy, police, judiciary, and clergy, was a major structural component of the genocide [184] [185] An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 Armenians were Islamized, [186] and it is estimated that as many as two million Turkish citizens in the early 21st century may have at least one Armenian grandparent [187] Some Armenians were allowed to convert to Islam and evade deportation, but the regime insisted on their destruction wherever their numbers exceeded the five to ten percent threshold, or there was a risk of them being able to preserve their nationality and culture [188] Talaat Pasha personally authorized conversion of Armenians and carefully tracked the loyalty of converted Armenians until the end of the war [189] Although the first and most important step was conversion to Islam, the process also required the eradication of Armenian names, language, and culture, and for women, immediate marriage to a Muslim [190] Although Islamization was the most feasible opportunity for survival, it also transgressed Armenian moral and social norms [191]\n\n\nConfiscation of property\nA secondary motivation for genocide was the destruction of the Armenian bourgeoisie to make room for a Turkish and Muslim middle class [128] and build a statist national economy controlled by Muslim Turks [163] [202] The campaign to Turkify the economy began in June 1914 with a law that obliged many non-Muslim merchants to hire Muslims Following the deportations, the businesses of the victims were taken over by Muslims who were often incompetent, leading to economic difficulties [203] The genocide had catastrophic effects on the Ottoman economy; Muslims were disadvantaged by the deportation of skilled professionals and entire districts fell into famine following their farmers' deportation [204] The Ottoman and Turkish governments passed a series of Abandoned Properties Laws to manage and redistribute property confiscated from Armenians [205] [206] Although the laws maintained that the state was simply administering the properties on behalf of the absent Armenians, there was no provision to return them to the owners—it was presumed that they had ceased to exist [207]\n\n\nDestination\nThe first arrivals in mid-1915 were accommodated in Aleppo From mid-November, the convoys were denied access to the city and redirected along the Baghdad Railway or the Euphrates towards Mosul The first transit camp was established at Sibil, east of Aleppo; one convoy would arrive each day while another would depart for Meskene or Deir ez-Zor [216] Dozens of concentration camps were set up in Syria and Upper Mesopotamia [217] By October 1915, some 870,000 deportees had reached Syria and Upper Mesopotamia Most were repeatedly transferred between camps, being held in each camp for a few weeks, until there were very few survivors [218] This strategy physically weakened the Armenians and spread disease, so much that some camps were shut down in late 1915 due to the threat of disease spreading to the Ottoman military [219] [220] In late 1915, the camps around Aleppo were liquidated and the survivors were forced to march to Ras al-Ayn; the camps around Ras al-Ayn were closed in early 1916 and the survivors sent to Deir ez-Zor [221]\n\n\nInternational reaction\nThe Ottoman Empire tried to prevent journalists and photographers from documenting the atrocities, threatening them with arrest [234] [235] Nevertheless, substantiated reports of mass killings were widely covered in Western newspapers [236] [237] On 24 May 1915, the Triple Entente (Russia, Britain, and France) formally condemned the Ottoman Empire for \"crimes against humanity and civilization\", and threatened to hold the perpetrators accountable [238] Witness testimony was published in books such as The Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire (1916) and Ambassador Morgenthau's Story (1918), raising public awareness of the genocide [239]\n\n\nAftermath\nIntentional, state-sponsored killing of Armenians mostly ceased by the end of January 1917, although sporadic massacres and starvation continued [246] Both contemporaries [247] [248] and later historians have estimated that around 1 million Armenians died during the genocide, [3] [249] with figures ranging from 600,000 to 1.5 million deaths [250] Between 800,000 and 1.2 million Armenians were deported, [250] [251] and contemporaries estimated that by late 1916 only 200,000 were still alive [250] As the British Army advanced in 1917 and 1918 northwards through the Levant, they liberated around 100,000 to 150,000 Armenians working for the Ottoman military under abysmal conditions, not including those held by Arab tribes [252]\n\n\nEnd of World War I\nIntentional, state-sponsored killing of Armenians mostly ceased by the end of January 1917, although sporadic massacres and starvation continued [246] Both contemporaries [247] [248] and later historians have estimated that around 1 million Armenians died during the genocide, [3] [249] with figures ranging from 600,000 to 1.5 million deaths [250] Between 800,000 and 1.2 million Armenians were deported, [250] [251] and contemporaries estimated that by late 1916 only 200,000 were still alive [250] As the British Army advanced in 1917 and 1918 northwards through the Levant, they liberated around 100,000 to 150,000 Armenians working for the Ottoman military under abysmal conditions, not including those held by Arab tribes [252]\n\n\nTrials\nFollowing the armistice, Allied governments championed the prosecution of Armenian genocide perpetrators [264] Grand Vizier Damat Ferid Pasha publicly recognized that 800,000 Ottoman citizens of Armenian origin had died as a result of state policy [265] and stated that \"humanity, civilizations are shuddering, and forever will shudder, in face of this tragedy\" [266] The postwar Ottoman government held the Ottoman Special Military Tribunal, by which it sought to pin the Armenian genocide onto the CUP leadership while exonerating the Ottoman Empire as a whole, therefore avoiding partition by the Allies [267] The court ruled that \"the crime of mass murder\" of Armenians was \"organized and carried out by the top leaders of CUP\" [268] Eighteen perpetrators (including Talaat, Enver, and Djemal) were sentenced to death, of whom only three were ultimately executed as the remainder had fled and were tried in absentia [269] [270] The 1920 Treaty of Sèvres, which awarded Armenia a large area in eastern Anatolia, eliminated the Ottoman government's purpose for holding the trials [271] Prosecution was hampered by a widespread belief among Turkish Muslims that the actions against the Armenians were not punishable crimes [163] Increasingly, the genocide was considered necessary and justified to establish a Turkish nation-state [272]\n\n\nTurkish War of Independence\nThe CUP regrouped as the Turkish nationalist movement to fight the Turkish War of Independence, [278] [279] [280] relying on the support of perpetrators of the genocide and those who had profited from it [281] [282] This movement saw the return of Armenian survivors as a mortal threat to its nationalist ambitions and the interests of its supporters The return of survivors was therefore impossible in most of Anatolia [138] [280] and thousands of Armenians who tried were murdered [283] Historian Raymond Kévorkian states that the war of independence was \"intended to complete the genocide by finally eradicating Armenian, Greek, and Syriac survivors\" [284] In 1920 Kâzım Karabekir, a Turkish general, invaded Armenia with orders \"to eliminate Armenia physically and politically\" [285] [286] Nearly 100,000 Armenians were massacred in Transcaucasia by the Turkish army and another 100,000 fled from Cilicia during the French withdrawal [286] According to Kévorkian, only the Soviet occupation of Armenia prevented another genocide [285]\n\n\nLegacy\nAccording to historian Margaret Lavinia Anderson, the Armenian genocide reached an \"iconic status\" as \"the apex of horrors conceivable\" before World War II [297] It was described by contemporaries as \"the murder of a nation\", \"race extermination\", [298] \"the greatest crime of the ages\", and \"the blackest page in modern history\" [299] [300] According to historian Stefan Ihrig, in Germany, the Nazis viewed post-1923 Turkey as a post-genocidal paradise and, \"incorporated the Armenian genocide, its 'lessons', tactics, and 'benefits', into their own worldview\" [301]\n\n\nTurkey\nIn the 1920s, Kurds and Alevis replaced Armenians as the perceived internal enemy of the Turkish state Militarism, weak rule of law, lack of minority rights, and especially the belief that Turkey is constantly under threat—thus justifying state violence—are among the main legacies of the genocide in Turkey [302] In postwar Turkey, the perpetrators of the genocide were hailed as martyrs of the national cause [280] Turkey's official denial of the Armenian genocide continues to rely on the CUP's justification of its actions The Turkish government maintains that the mass deportation of Armenians was a legitimate action to combat an existential threat to the empire, but that there was no intention to exterminate the Armenian people [303] [304] The government's position is supported by the majority of Turkish citizens [305] Many Kurds, who themselves have suffered political repression in Turkey, have recognized and condemned the genocide [306] [307]\n\n\nArmenia and Azerbaijan\nArmenian Genocide Remembrance Day is commemorated on 24 April each year in Armenia and abroad, the anniversary of the deportation of Armenian intellectuals [315] [316] On 24 April 1965, 100,000 Armenians protested in Yerevan, and diaspora Armenians demonstrated across the world in favor of recognition of the genocide and annexing land from Turkey [317] [315] A memorial was completed two years later, at Tsitsernakaberd above Yerevan [315] [318]\n\n\nInternational recognition\nIn response to continuing denial by the Turkish state, many Armenian diaspora activists have lobbied for international formal recognition of the Armenian genocide, an effort that has become a central concern of the Armenian diaspora [323] [324] From the 1970s onward, many countries avoided recognition to preserve good relations with Turkey [325] As of 2023 [update], 31 UN member states have formally recognized the genocide, along with Pope Francis and the European Parliament [326] [327] Azerbaijan, Pakistan, and Turkey explicitly deny the genocide.\n\n\nCultural depictions\nAfter meeting Armenian survivors in the Middle East, Austrian–Jewish writer Franz Werfel wrote The Forty Days of Musa Dagh, a fictionalized retelling of the successful Armenian uprising in Musa Dagh, as a warning of the dangers of Nazism [328] According to Ihrig, the book, released in 1933, is among the most important works of twentieth-century literature to address genocide and \"is still considered essential reading for Armenians worldwide\" [329] The genocide became a central theme in English-language Armenian-American literature [330] The first film about the Armenian genocide, Ravished Armenia, was released in 1919 as a fundraiser for Near East Relief, based on the survival story of Aurora Mardiganian, who played herself [331] [332] [333] Since then more films about the genocide have been made, although it took several decades for any of them to reach a mass-market audience [334] The abstract expressionist paintings of Arshile Gorky were influenced by his experience of the genocide [335] More than 200 memorials have been erected in 32 countries to commemorate the event [336]\n\n\nArchives and historiography\nThe genocide is extensively documented in the archives of Germany, Austria, the United States, Russia, France, and the United Kingdom, [337] as well as the Ottoman archives, despite systematic purges of incriminating documents by Turkey [338] There are also thousands of eyewitness accounts from Western missionaries and Armenian survivors [339] [340] [341] Polish-Jewish lawyer Raphael Lemkin, who coined the term genocide in 1944, became interested in war crimes after reading about the 1921 trial of Soghomon Tehlirian for the assassination of Talaat Pasha Lemkin recognized the fate of the Armenians as one of the most significant genocides in the twentieth century [342] [343] Almost all historians and scholars outside Turkey, and an increasing number of Turkish scholars, recognize the destruction of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire as genocide [305]

skeptical of a growing, exclusionary Turkish nationalism in the Young Turk movement, the ARF decided to ally with the CUP in December 1907 [45] [46] In 1908, the CUP came to power in the Young Turk Revolution, which began with a string of CUP assassinations of leading officials in Macedonia [47] [48] Abdul Hamid was forced to reinstate the 1876 constitution and restore the Ottoman parliament, which was celebrated by Ottomans of all ethnicities and religions [49] [50] Security improved in parts of the eastern provinces after 1908 and the CUP took steps to reform the local gendarmerie, [51] although tensions remained high [52] Despite an agreement to reverse the land usurpation of the previous decades in the 1910 Salonica Accord between the ARF and the CUP, the latter made no efforts to carry this out [53] [54]\n\n\nBalkan Wars\nThe 1912 First Balkan War resulted in the loss of almost all of the empire's European territory [65] and the mass expulsion of Muslims from the Balkans [66] Ottoman Muslim society was incensed by the atrocities committed against Balkan Muslims, intensifying anti-Christian sentiment and leading to a desire for revenge [67] [68] Blame for the loss was assigned to all Christians, including the Ottoman Armenians, many of whom had fought on the Ottoman side [69] The Balkan Wars put an end to the Ottomanist movement for pluralism and coexistence; [70] instead, the CUP turned to an increasingly radical Turkish nationalism to preserve the empire [71] CUP leaders such as Talaat and Enver Pasha came to blame non-Muslim population concentrations in strategic areas for many of the empire's problems, concluding by mid-1914 that they were internal tumors to be excised [72] Of these, Ottoman Armenians were considered the most dangerous, because CUP leaders feared that their homeland in Anatolia—claimed as the last refuge of the Turkish nation—would break away from the empire as the Balkans had [73] [74] [71]\n\n\nOttoman entry into World War I\nA few days after the outbreak of World War I, the CUP concluded an alliance with Germany on 2 August 1914 [83] The same month, CUP representatives went to an ARF conference demanding that, in the event of war with Russia, the ARF incite Russian Armenians to intervene on the Ottoman side Instead, the delegates resolved that Armenians should fight for the countries of their citizenships [84] During its war preparations, the Ottoman government recruited thousands of prisoners to join the paramilitary Special Organization, [85] which initially focused on stirring up revolts among Muslims behind Russian lines beginning before the empire officially entered the war [86] On 29 October 1914, the empire entered World War I on the side of the Central Powers by launching a surprise attack on Russian ports in the Black Sea [87] Many Russian Armenians were enthusiastic about the war, but Ottoman Armenians were more ambivalent, afraid that supporting Russia would bring retaliation Organization of Armenian volunteer units by Russian Armenians, later joined by some Ottoman Armenian deserters, further increased Ottoman suspicions against their Armenian population [88]\n\n\nOnset of genocide\nMinister of War Enver Pasha took over command of the Ottoman armies for the invasion of Russian territory, and tried to encircle the Russian Caucasus Army at the Battle of Sarikamish, fought from December 1914 to January 1915 Unprepared for the harsh winter conditions, [100] his forces were routed, losing more than 60,000 men [101] The retreating Ottoman army destroyed dozens of Ottoman Armenian villages in Bitlis vilayet, massacring their inhabitants [97] Enver publicly blamed his defeat on Armenians who he claimed had actively sided with the Russians, a theory that became a consensus among CUP leaders [102] [103] Reports of local incidents such as weapons caches, severed telegraph lines, and occasional killings confirmed preexisting beliefs about Armenian treachery and fueled paranoia among CUP leaders that a coordinated Armenian conspiracy was plotting against the empire [104] [105] Discounting contrary reports that most Armenians were loyal, the CUP leaders decided that the Armenians had to be eliminated to save the empire [104]\n\n\nSystematic deportations\nWe have been blamed for not making a distinction between guilty and innocent Armenians  [To do so] was impossible Because of the nature of things, one who was still innocent today could be guilty tomorrow The concern for the safety of Turkey simply had to silence all other concerns.\n\n\nAims\nWe have been blamed for not making a distinction between guilty and innocent Armenians  [To do so] was impossible Because of the nature of things, one who was still innocent today could be guilty tomorrow The concern for the safety of Turkey simply had to silence all other concerns.\n\n\nAdministrative organization\nOn 23 May 1915, Talaat ordered the deportation of all Armenians in Van, Bitlis, and Erzerum [150] [151] To grant a cover of legality to the deportation, already well underway in the eastern provinces and Cilicia, the Council of Ministers approved the Temporary Law of Deportation, which allowed authorities to deport anyone deemed suspect [151] [152] [153] On 21 June, Talaat ordered the deportation of all Armenians throughout the empire, even Adrianople, 2,000 kilometers (1,200 mi) from the Russian front [154] Following the elimination of the Armenian population in eastern Anatolia, in August 1915, the Armenians of western Anatolia and European Turkey were targeted for deportation Some areas with a very low Armenian population and some cities, including Constantinople, were partially spared [155] [156]\n\n\nDeath marches\nAlthough the majority of able-bodied Armenian men had been conscripted into the army, others deserted, paid the exemption tax, or fell outside the age range of conscription Unlike the earlier massacres of Ottoman Armenians, in 1915 Armenians were not usually killed in their villages, to avoid destruction of property or unauthorized looting Instead, the men were usually separated from the rest of the deportees during the first few days and executed Few resisted, believing it would put their families in greater danger [161] Boys above the age of twelve (sometimes fifteen) were treated as adult men [172] Execution sites were chosen for proximity to major roads and for rugged terrain, lakes, wells, or cisterns to facilitate the concealment or disposal of corpses [171] [173] [174] The convoys would stop at a nearby transit camp, where the escorts would demand a ransom from the Armenians Those unable to pay were murdered [161] Units of the Special Organization, often wearing gendarme uniforms, were stationed at the killing sites; escorting gendarmes often did not participate in killing [174]\n\n\nIslamization\nThe Islamization of Armenians, carried out as a systematic state policy involving the bureaucracy, police, judiciary, and clergy, was a major structural component of the genocide [184] [185] An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 Armenians were Islamized, [186] and it is estimated that as many as two million Turkish citizens in the early 21st century may have at least one Armenian grandparent [187] Some Armenians were allowed to convert to Islam and evade deportation, but the regime insisted on their destruction wherever their numbers exceeded the five to ten percent threshold, or there was a risk of them being able to preserve their nationality and culture [188] Talaat Pasha personally authorized conversion of Armenians and carefully tracked the loyalty of converted Armenians until the end of the war [189] Although the first and most important step was conversion to Islam, the process also required the eradication of Armenian names, language, and culture, and for women, immediate marriage to a Muslim [190] Although Islamization was the most feasible opportunity for survival, it also transgressed Armenian moral and social norms [191]\n\n\nConfiscation of property\nA secondary motivation for genocide was the destruction of the Armenian bourgeoisie to make room for a Turkish and Muslim middle class [128] and build a statist national economy controlled by Muslim Turks [163] [202] The campaign to Turkify the economy began in June 1914 with a law that obliged many non-Muslim merchants to hire Muslims Following the deportations, the businesses of the victims were taken over by Muslims who were often incompetent, leading to economic difficulties [203] The genocide had catastrophic effects on the Ottoman economy; Muslims were disadvantaged by the deportation of skilled professionals and entire districts fell into famine following their farmers' deportation [204] The Ottoman and Turkish governments passed a series of Abandoned Properties Laws to manage and redistribute property confiscated from Armenians [205] [206] Although the laws maintained that the state was simply administering the properties on behalf of the absent Armenians, there was no provision to return them to the owners—it was presumed that they had ceased to exist [207]\n\n\nDestination\nThe first arrivals in mid-1915 were accommodated in Aleppo From mid-November, the convoys were denied access to the city and redirected along the Baghdad Railway or the Euphrates towards Mosul The first transit camp was established at Sibil, east of Aleppo; one convoy would arrive each day while another would depart for Meskene or Deir ez-Zor [216] Dozens of concentration camps were set up in Syria and Upper Mesopotamia [217] By October 1915, some 870,000 deportees had reached Syria and Upper Mesopotamia Most were repeatedly transferred between camps, being held in each camp for a few weeks, until there were very few survivors [218] This strategy physically weakened the Armenians and spread disease, so much that some camps were shut down in late 1915 due to the threat of disease spreading to the Ottoman military [219] [220] In late 1915, the camps around Aleppo were liquidated and the survivors were forced to march to Ras al-Ayn; the camps around Ras al-Ayn were closed in early 1916 and the survivors sent to Deir ez-Zor [221]\n\n\nInternational reaction\nThe Ottoman Empire tried to prevent journalists and photographers from documenting the atrocities, threatening them with arrest [234] [235] Nevertheless, substantiated reports of mass killings were widely covered in Western newspapers [236] [237] On 24 May 1915, the Triple Entente (Russia, Britain, and France) formally condemned the Ottoman Empire for \"crimes against humanity and civilization\", and threatened to hold the perpetrators accountable [238] Witness testimony was published in books such as The Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire (1916) and Ambassador Morgenthau's Story (1918), raising public awareness of the genocide [239]\n\n\nAftermath\nIntentional, state-sponsored killing of Armenians mostly ceased by the end of January 1917, although sporadic massacres and starvation continued [246] Both contemporaries [247] [248] and later historians have estimated that around 1 million Armenians died during the genocide, [3] [249] with figures ranging from 600,000 to 1.5 million deaths [250] Between 800,000 and 1.2 million Armenians were deported, [250] [251] and contemporaries estimated that by late 1916 only 200,000 were still alive [250] As the British Army advanced in 1917 and 1918 northwards through the Levant, they liberated around 100,000 to 150,000 Armenians working for the Ottoman military under abysmal conditions, not including those held by Arab tribes [252]\n\n\nEnd of World War I\nIntentional, state-sponsored killing of Armenians mostly ceased by the end of January 1917, although sporadic massacres and starvation continued [246] Both contemporaries [247] [248] and later historians have estimated that around 1 million Armenians died during the genocide, [3] [249] with figures ranging from 600,000 to 1.5 million deaths [250] Between 800,000 and 1.2 million Armenians were deported, [250] [251] and contemporaries estimated that by late 1916 only 200,000 were still alive [250] As the British Army advanced in 1917 and 1918 northwards through the Levant, they liberated around 100,000 to 150,000 Armenians working for the Ottoman military under abysmal conditions, not including those held by Arab tribes [252]\n\n\nTrials\nFollowing the armistice, Allied governments championed the prosecution of Armenian genocide perpetrators [264] Grand Vizier Damat Ferid Pasha publicly recognized that 800,000 Ottoman citizens of Armenian origin had died as a result of state policy [265] and stated that \"humanity, civilizations are shuddering, and forever will shudder, in face of this tragedy\" [266] The postwar Ottoman government held the Ottoman Special Military Tribunal, by which it sought to pin the Armenian genocide onto the CUP leadership while exonerating the Ottoman Empire as a whole, therefore avoiding partition by the Allies [267] The court ruled that \"the crime of mass murder\" of Armenians was \"organized and carried out by the top leaders of CUP\" [268] Eighteen perpetrators (including Talaat, Enver, and Djemal) were sentenced to death, of whom only three were ultimately executed as the remainder had fled and were tried in absentia [269] [270] The 1920 Treaty of Sèvres, which awarded Armenia a large area in eastern Anatolia, eliminated the Ottoman government's purpose for holding the trials [271] Prosecution was hampered by a widespread belief among Turkish Muslims that the actions against the Armenians were not punishable crimes [163] Increasingly, the genocide was considered necessary and justified to establish a Turkish nation-state [272]\n\n\nTurkish War of Independence\nThe CUP regrouped as the Turkish nationalist movement to fight the Turkish War of Independence, [278] [279] [280] relying on the support of perpetrators of the genocide and those who had profited from it [281] [282] This movement saw the return of Armenian survivors as a mortal threat to its nationalist ambitions and the interests of its supporters The return of survivors was therefore impossible in most of Anatolia [138] [280] and thousands of Armenians who tried were murdered [283] Historian Raymond Kévorkian states that the war of independence was \"intended to complete the genocide by finally eradicating Armenian, Greek, and Syriac survivors\" [284] In 1920 Kâzım Karabekir, a Turkish general, invaded Armenia with orders \"to eliminate Armenia physically and politically\" [285] [286] Nearly 100,000 Armenians were massacred in Transcaucasia by the Turkish army and another 100,000 fled from Cilicia during the French withdrawal [286] According to Kévorkian, only the Soviet occupation of Armenia prevented another genocide [285]\n\n\nLegacy\nAccording to historian Margaret Lavinia Anderson, the Armenian genocide reached an \"iconic status\" as \"the apex of horrors conceivable\" before World War II [297] It was described by contemporaries as \"the murder of a nation\", \"race extermination\", [298] \"the greatest crime of the ages\", and \"the blackest page in modern history\" [299] [300] According to historian Stefan Ihrig, in Germany, the Nazis viewed post-1923 Turkey as a post-genocidal paradise and, \"incorporated the Armenian genocide, its 'lessons', tactics, and 'benefits', into their own worldview\" [301]\n\n\nTurkey\nIn the 1920s, Kurds and Alevis replaced Armenians as the perceived internal enemy of the Turkish state Militarism, weak rule of law, lack of minority rights, and especially the belief that Turkey is constantly under threat—thus justifying state violence—are among the main legacies of the genocide in Turkey [302] In postwar Turkey, the perpetrators of the genocide were hailed as martyrs of the national cause [280] Turkey's official denial of the Armenian genocide continues to rely on the CUP's justification of its actions The Turkish government maintains that the mass deportation of Armenians was a legitimate action to combat an existential threat to the empire, but that there was no intention to exterminate the Armenian people [303] [304] The government's position is supported by the majority of Turkish citizens [305] Many Kurds, who themselves have suffered political repression in Turkey, have recognized and condemned the genocide [306] [307]\n\n\nArmenia and Azerbaijan\nArmenian Genocide Remembrance Day is commemorated on 24 April each year in Armenia and abroad, the anniversary of the deportation of Armenian intellectuals [315] [316] On 24 April 1965, 100,000 Armenians protested in Yerevan, and diaspora Armenians demonstrated across the world in favor of recognition of the genocide and annexing land from Turkey [317] [315] A memorial was completed two years later, at Tsitsernakaberd above Yerevan [315] [318]\n\n\nInternational recognition\nIn response to continuing denial by the Turkish state, many Armenian diaspora activists have lobbied for international formal recognition of the Armenian genocide, an effort that has become a central concern of the Armenian diaspora [323] [324] From the 1970s onward, many countries avoided recognition to preserve good relations with Turkey [325] As of 2023 [update], 31 UN member states have formally recognized the genocide, along with Pope Francis and the European Parliament [326] [327] Azerbaijan, Pakistan, and Turkey explicitly deny the genocide.\n\n\nCultural depictions\nAfter meeting Armenian survivors in the Middle East, Austrian–Jewish writer Franz Werfel wrote The Forty Days of Musa Dagh, a fictionalized retelling of the successful Armenian uprising in Musa Dagh, as a warning of the dangers of Nazism [328] According to Ihrig, the book, released in 1933, is among the most important works of twentieth-century literature to address genocide and \"is still considered essential reading for Armenians worldwide\" [329] The genocide became a central theme in English-language Armenian-American literature [330] The first film about the Armenian genocide, Ravished Armenia, was released in 1919 as a fundraiser for Near East Relief, based on the survival story of Aurora Mardiganian, who played herself [331] [332] [333] Since then more films about the genocide have been made, although it took several decades for any of them to reach a mass-market audience [334] The abstract expressionist paintings of Arshile Gorky were influenced by his experience of the genocide [335] More than 200 memorials have been erected in 32 countries to commemorate the event [336]\n\n\nArchives and historiography\nThe genocide is extensively documented in the archives of Germany, Austria, the United States, Russia, France, and the United Kingdom, [337] as well as the Ottoman archives, despite systematic purges of incriminating documents by Turkey [338] There are also thousands of eyewitness accounts from Western missionaries and Armenian survivors [339] [340] [341] Polish-Jewish lawyer Raphael Lemkin, who coined the term genocide in 1944, became interested in war crimes after reading about the 1921 trial of Soghomon Tehlirian for the assassination of Talaat Pasha Lemkin recognized the fate of the Armenians as one of the most significant genocides in the twentieth century [342] [343] Almost all historians and scholars outside Turkey, and an increasing number of Turkish scholars, recognize the destruction of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire as genocide [305]

He assisted his father on several film sets and later acted in documentaries directed by students of the Film and Television Institute of India. Director Ketan Mehta noticed Khan's talent and offered him a role in the low-budget experimental film \"Holi\" (1981). The film, based on a play by Mahesh Elkunchwar, dealt with the practice of ragging in India. Although Khan's role was small, it marked the beginning of his acting career.\n\n**1984–1989: Debut and Career Challenges**\n\nIn the early 1980s, Khan appeared in several films, including \"Yaadon Ki Baaraat\" (1981), \"Zabaan Sambhal Ke\" (1982), and \"Naukar Biwi Ho Toh Aisi\" (1983). However, it was his role as Sunil in \"Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak\" (1988) that brought him critical acclaim. The film, directed by Mansoor Khan, was a commercial success and established Khan as a leading actor in Bollywood.\n\n**1990–2004: Rise to Prominence and Hiatus**\n\nThe 1990s saw Khan's career soar with the success of films like \"Dil\" (1990), \"Dil Hai Ke Manta Nahin\" (1991), and \"Raja Hindustani\" (1996).

Although the film received negative reviews from critics, it performed reasonably well at the box office.\n\n**Other Works**\n\nIn addition to his acting career, Khan is also a successful producer and director.

Bird rights, as was stipulated in his contract at the time [40] [41] The trade was retooled, with Trenton Hassell replacing George, and Keith Van Horn, who had agreed to come out of retirement,

Lin but after Lin left to the Houston Rockets, it was assumed that Kidd would serve as a backup to Raymond Felton at the point guard position [57] During the preseason however, the Knicks head coach Mike Woodson decided to start the season with both playmakers in the starting lineup and Kidd adjusting more to the shooting guard role.\n\n\nCoaching career\nOn June 12, 2013, Kidd was named head

won re-election against Mitt Romney, Donald Trump tweeted that \"The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy\", that the election was a \"total sham\", and that the United States was \"not a democracy\" [63]\n\n\nTrump's 2012 accusations of electoral fraud\nIn the aftermath of the 2012 presidential election, in which incumbent president Barack Obama won re-election against Mitt Romney, Donald Trump tweeted that \"The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy\", that the election was a \"total sham\", and that the United States was \"not a democracy\" [63]\n\n\nUncertainty over Trump accepting an electoral loss in 2016\nTrump repeatedly suggested that the election is \"rigged\" against him, and in the final debate he cast doubt on whether he would accept the results of the election should he lose, saying \"I'll keep you in suspense\" [64] His comment touched off a media and political uproar, in which he was accused of \"threatening to upend a fundamental pillar of American democracy\" and \"rais(ing) the prospect that millions of his supporters may not accept the results on Nov. 8 if he loses\" [65] Rick Hasen of University of California, Irvine School of Law, an election-law expert, described Trump's comments as \"appalling and unprecedented\" and feared there could be \"violence in the streets from his supporters if Trump loses.\" [66] The next day Trump said, \"Of course, I would accept a clear election result, but I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result.\" He also stated that he would \"totally\" accept the election results \"if I win.\" [67]\n\n\nUncertainty over Trump accepting an electoral loss in 2020\nDuring the 2020 campaign, Trump indicated in Twitter posts, interviews and speeches that he might refuse to recognize the outcome of the election if he were defeated; Trump falsely suggested that the election would be rigged against him [68] [69] [70] In July 2020, Trump declined to state whether he would accept the results, telling Fox News anchor Chris Wallace that \"I have to see No, I'm not going to just say yes I'm not going to say no.\" [71] [72] [73] Trump also proposed delaying the presidential election due to COVID-19, until Americans could vote \"properly, securely and safely\" [74] [c]\n\n\nRefusal to accept 2020 electoral loss\nAt 2 am on Wednesday, November 4, 2020, with the election results still unclear, Trump held a press conference at the White House in which he stated: \"This is a fraud on the American public This is an embarrassment to our country We were getting ready to win this election Frankly, we did win this election.\" [89] The statement was condemned as false almost immediately The statement was also described as having been months in the making [90] [91] At 9 am on Thursday, November 5, 2020, Trump tweeted \"STOP THE COUNT!\" [92] However, at that time Biden was already leading in enough states such that stopping the count would have resulted in a Biden victory [92] [93] After all major news organizations declared Biden the President-elect on November 7, [94] Trump refused to accept his loss, declaring \"this election is far from over\" and alleging election fraud without providing evidence [95] Privately, according to reporting by Maggie Haberman, he told one aide \"I'm just not going to leave\", and he told another aide, \"We're never leaving How can you leave when you won an election?\" [96]\n\n\nRefusal to accept 2020 electoral loss by Donald Trump\nAt 2 am on Wednesday, November 4, 2020, with the

at the White House in which he stated: \"This is a fraud on the American public This is an embarrassment to our country We were getting ready to win this election Frankly, we did win this election.\"

Privately, according to reporting by Maggie Haberman, he told one aide \"I'm just not going to leave\", and he told another aide, \"We're never leaving How can you leave when you won an election?\" [96]\n\n\nAfter results declared\nIn the months between the election and Inauguration Day (January 20), Trump engaged in multiple efforts to overturn the results He filed numerous lawsuits, urged local and state authorities to overturn the results in their jurisdiction, pressed the Justice Department to verify unsupported claims of election fraud, and worked with congressional allies to get the results overturned in Congress on January 6 [97]\n\n\nAfter leaving office\nSince leaving office, Trump has continued to insist that he won the 2020 election He reportedly dislikes the term \"former president\", and his official statements refer to him as \"the 45th President\" or simply as \"45\", as on his new website, www.45office.com [121] During his public speeches, he insists that massive election fraud caused his loss, saying, \"This was the scam of the century and this was the crime of the century\" [122] and \"We won the election twice  [2016 and 2020] and it's possible we'll have to win it a third time  [2024].\" [123]\n\n\nRefusal to accept 2020 electoral loss by Trump's allies and supporters\nStop the Steal is a far-right and conservative campaign and protest movement in the United States promoting the conspiracy theory [125] that falsely [126] posits that widespread electoral fraud occurred during the 2020 presidential election to deny incumbent president Donald Trump victory over former vice president Joe Biden Trump and his supporters have asserted, without evidence, [127] [128] that he is the winner of the election, and that large-scale voter and vote counting fraud took place in several swing states [128] The Associated Press, ABC News, CBS News, CNN, Decision Desk HQ, NBC News, The New York Times, and Fox News projected Biden as the president-elect, having surpassed the 270 Electoral College votes needed to claim victory [6] [129] A New York Times survey of state election officials found no evidence of significant voting fraud, nor did the Justice Department, and dozens of lawsuits filed by Trump and his proxies to challenge voting results in several states failed [34] [130] [131] [132]\n\n\nStop the Steal\nStop the Steal is a far-right and conservative campaign and protest movement in the United States promoting the conspiracy theory [125] that falsely [126] posits that widespread electoral fraud occurred during the 2020 presidential election to deny incumbent president Donald Trump victory over former vice president Joe Biden Trump and his supporters have asserted, without evidence, [127] [128] that he is the winner of the election, and that large-scale voter and vote counting fraud took place in several swing states [128] The Associated Press, ABC News, CBS News, CNN, Decision Desk HQ, NBC News, The New York Times, and Fox News projected Biden as the president-elect, having surpassed the 270 Electoral College votes needed to claim victory [6] [129] A New York Times survey of state election officials found no evidence of significant voting fraud, nor did the Justice Department, and dozens of lawsuits filed by Trump and his proxies to challenge voting results in several states failed [34] [130] [131] [132]\n\n\nConspiracy theories\nMultiple conspiracy theories were promoted, such as the claim that billionaire far-left donor George Soros \"stole the election\" [164] Another is Italygate, a QAnon-adjacent [165] [166] theory originating from a fake news website, which claimed that the election was rigged in Biden's favor by the U.S Embassy in Rome, using satellites and military technology to remotely switch votes from Trump to Biden There is no evidence to support this [165] [167] Republican congressman Scott Perry texted White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows a link to a YouTube video making the allegation [165] [168] The New York Times later reported that, during Trump's last weeks in office, Meadows emailed the video to the Department of Justice, seeking an investigation [169]\n\n\nNovember 2020\nOn at least one occasion in November 2020, Trump privately acknowledged that he lost the election Alyssa Farah Griffin, a White House aide to Trump, recalls him exclaiming \"Can you believe I lost to this guy?\" while watching Biden on television [182] This, however, was not Trump's public position.\n\n\n\"Fake\" electors\nOn November 3, Gregory Jacob wrote to Marc Short that it would be undesirable for the public to perceive Vice President Pence as if he had prejudged \"questions concerning disputed electoral votes\" [189]\n\n\nLame duck firings and hirings\nAfter vote counts showed a Biden victory, Trump engaged in what has been called a \"post-election purge\", firing or forcing out at least a dozen officials and replacing them with loyalists [198] Secretary of Defense Mark Esper was fired by tweet on November 9 [199] [200] Undersecretary for Defense Joseph D Kernan and Acting Undersecretary for Policy James H Anderson resigned in protest or were forced out [198] The White House sought to learn the names of political appointees who had applauded Anderson upon his departure, so they could be fired [201] The DOD chief of staff, Jen Stewart, was replaced by a former staffer to Representative Devin Nunes [198] On November 30, Christopher P Maier, the head of the Pentagon's Defeat ISIS Task Force, was ousted and the task force was disbanded; a White House official told him that the United States had won the war against the Islamic State, so the task force was no longer needed [202]\n\n\nLawsuits\nAfter the 2020 United States presidential election, the campaign for incumbent president Donald Trump filed a number of lawsuits contesting election processes, vote-counting, and the vote-certification process in multiple states, including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin [215] Many such cases were quickly dismissed, [100] and lawyers and other observers noted that the lawsuits were unlikely to have an effect on the outcome of the election [216] [217] [218] By November 19, more than two dozen of the legal challenges filed since Election Day had failed [105]\n\n\nMichigan officials pressured to not certify\nPrior to November 17, the four-member board of canvassers of Wayne County, Michigan, was deadlocked on election-result certification along party lines with the two Republican members refusing to certify, but on November 17 the board voted unanimously to certify its results [221] Trump and Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel called the two Republican members of the board that day to pressure them to not sign the official statement of votes; the next day the two Republicans sought but failed to rescind their votes for certification, signing affidavits stating that they had voted for certification only because the two Democratic members had promised a full audit of the county's votes [222] [223] The two denied Trump's call had influenced their reversal [224] A recording of the phone call surfaced in December 2023, on which McDaniel can be heard telling the two Republicans, \"We will get you attorneys,\" to which Trump added, \"We'll take care of that.\" Trump can also be heard to say, \"We've got to fight for our country We can't let these people take our country away from us.\" [225]\n\n\nAttempt to seize voting machines in Michigan\nStarting in November 2020, the Trump campaign attempted to get local law enforcement agencies to seize voting machines for the Trump operation to review In one Michigan county, Trump advisors including Rudy Giuliani phoned the county prosecutor on or about November 20, 2020 They asked him to obtain the county's voting machines and turn them over to the Trump team He refused, but a judge later ordered the machines to be made available to Trump representatives They later produced a \"forensic report\" claiming evidence of fraud; election experts have said the conclusion was false and the report \"critically flawed\" [233]\n\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State pressured to disqualify ballots\nThe 2020 United States presidential election in Georgia produced an initial count wherein Biden defeated Trump by around 14,000 votes, triggering an automatic recount due to the small margin On November 13, 2020, while the recount was ongoing, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina privately called Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to discuss Georgia's vote counting [104] [235] Raffensperger, a Republican, told The Washington Post that Graham had asked whether Raffensperger could disqualify all mail-in ballots in counties that had more signature errors [104] Gabriel Sterling, a Republican election official and staffer to Raffensperger, was present for the call, and Sterling confirmed that Graham had asked that question [236]\n\n\nWisconsin recount-obstruction\nOn November 5, 2020, Andrew Iverson, head of Trump's Wisconsin campaign, told other campaign operatives in a strategy session: \"Here's the deal: Comms is going to continue to fan the flame and get the word out about Democrats trying to steal this election We'll do whatever they need Just be on standby if there's any stunts we need to pull.\" [e] [238]\n\n\nPartisan hearings with Republican legislatures\nOn November 25, 2020, one day after Pennsylvania certified its election results, a Republican state senator requested a hearing of the State Senate Majority Policy Committee to discuss election issues The event, described as an \"informational meeting\", was held at a hotel in Gettysburg and featured Rudy Giuliani asserting that the election had been subject to massive fraud Trump also spoke to the group by speakerphone, repeating his false claim that he had actually won in Pennsylvania and other swing states, and saying \"We have to turn the election over\" [241]\n\n\nConspiracy allegations\nDays before the 2020 presidential election, Dennis Montgomery, a software designer with a history of making dubious claims, asserted that a program called Scorecard, running on a government supercomputer called Hammer, would be used to switch votes from Trump to Biden on voting machines Trump legal team attorney Sidney Powell promoted the conspiracy theory on Lou Dobbs Tonight on November 6, [244] [245] and again two days later on Maria Bartiromo's Fox Business program, claiming to have \"evidence that that is exactly what happened\" [245] She also asserted that the CIA ignored warnings about the software, and urged Trump to fire director Gina Haspel [246] Christopher Krebs, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), characterized the supercomputer claim as \"nonsense\" and a \"hoax\" CISA described the 2020 election as \"the most secure in American history\", with \"no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes or was in any way compromised\" [245] [247] A few days later, Trump fired Krebs by tweet, claiming that Krebs' analysis was \"highly inaccurate\" [248]\n\n\nThreats of violence by Trump supporters\nAfter Biden won the election, angry Trump supporters threatened election officials, election officials' family members, and elections staff in at least eight states via emails, telephone calls and letters; some of the menacing and vitriolic communications included death threats Officials terrorized by the threats included officials in the swing states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada, and Arizona, as well as a few less competitive states [275] Some officials had to seek police protection [275] [276] or move from their homes due to the threats [275] The director of the nonpartisan, nonprofit Center for Election Innovation & Research, described the threats as frightening and said, \"These threats often go into areas related to race or sex or anti-Semitism More than once they specifically refer to gun violence.\" Prominent Republicans ignored or said little about the threats of violence [275]\n\n\nDecember 2020\nOn December 1, 2020, U.S Attorney General William Barr said U.S attorneys and FBI agents had investigated complaints and allegations of fraud, but found none of significance [34] [97] [285] [286] On December 3, 2020, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said no evidence had yet been found of foreign interference [287] [288]\n\n\nTrump's attempt to pressure state officials\nOn December 5, Trump placed a call to Georgia governor Brian Kemp in which he urged the governor to call a special session of the state legislature to override the election results and appoint electors who would support Trump [108] He also called the Pennsylvania speaker of the house with similar objectives, and had earlier invited Michigan Republican state officials to the White House to discuss election results in that state [108] [290] The Georgia and Pennsylvania contacts were made after Biden's victories had been certified in those states; Biden's Michigan victory was certified three days after the Trump White House meeting [109] [110] [291]\n\n\nSupreme Court petitions\nBefore and after the election, Trump said he expected the outcome would be decided by the Supreme Court, where conservative justices held a 6–3 majority, with three of the justices having been appointed by Trump [304] [130]\n\n\nConsideration of special counsel and martial law\nAfter legal efforts by Trump and his proxies had failed in numerous state and federal courts, including the Supreme Court, [312] some right-wing activists and Trump allies – including Michael Flynn, Sidney Powell, and L Lin Wood – suggested that Trump could suspend the Constitution, declare martial law and \"rerun\" the election [313] [314] Many retired military officers, attorneys, and other commentators expressed horror at such a notion [315] [f] Trump held an Oval Office meeting on December 18 with Rudy Giuliani, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, Powell, and Flynn At the meeting, Trump entertained the idea of naming Powell, who has promoted election conspiracy theories and falsehoods, as special counsel to investigate election matters, though most advisors in attendance strongly opposed the idea Two executive orders were drafted to appoint a special counsel and confiscate voting machines, which Trump falsely claimed were rigged against him One order called for the Pentagon to seize machines, while the other tasked the Department of Homeland Security At Trump's direction, Giuliani called Ken Cuccinelli, the second in command at DHS, on December 17 to ask if the department could seize the machines, but Cuccinelli said it did not have the authority On Giuliani's advice, Trump had rejected a recommendation from Flynn and Powell to have the Pentagon seize the machines, and Bill Barr flatly rejected the president's suggestion that the Justice Department do it [320] [51] [321] [322] Flynn reportedly discussed his idea to declare martial law, although others also resisted that idea, and Trump's opinion on the matter was unclear That same day, Flynn appeared on Newsmax TV to suggest that Trump had the power to deploy the military to \"rerun\" the election in the swing states that Trump had lost [312] Trump dismissed reports about a discussion of martial law as \"fake news\", but it remained unclear whether he had endorsed the notion [323]\n\n\nPlanning for Congress to overturn the election on January 6\nOn December 21, Congressman Mo Brooks, who had been the first member of Congress to announce he would object to the January 6, 2021 certification of the Electoral College results, [328] [329] organized three White House meetings between Trump, Republican lawmakers, and others Attendees included Trump, Vice President Pence, representatives Jody Hice (R-Ga.), Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), and Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), representative-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), and members of the Trump legal team The purpose of the meetings was to strategize about how Congress could overturn the election results on January 6 Brooks confirmed after one such meeting that it had been \"a back-and-forth concerning the planning and strategy for January the 6th.\" [330]\n\n\nPressure on Pence\nIn the run-up to election certification on January 6, attempts to uncover significant election fraud bore no fruit and related legal challenges were rejected by the courts Hence, those seeking to overturn the election focused attention increasingly on then-vice-president Mike Pence The Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires the President of the Senate, which was Pence for the January 6 certification of the presidential election, to supervise the counting of electoral ballots at a joint session of the Congress [332] The Trump team developed multiple theories about how the Vice President might act on January 6 to aid the overturning of election results; and repeatedly encouraged him to act accordingly [citation needed]\n\n\n\"Pence Card\" conspiracy\n\n\n\nDecember timeline\nJohn Eastman, author of the Eastman memos, began working with the Trump team in November 2020 [347] Trump adviser Peter Navarro claimed that the \"Green Bay Sweep\" plan was developed over weeks prior to January 6, 2021 [348]\n\n\nPressure on Justice Department\nOn December 14, two weeks after Barr stated there was no evidence of significant election fraud, Trump announced that Barr would be leaving as attorney general by Christmas [34] [355] Before Trump's announcement, he enlisted Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and other aides to pressure deputy attorney general Jeffrey Rosen, who would replace Barr on December 23, and other Justice Department officials to challenge the election results Meadows and a top Trump aide emailed allegations of voting anomalies in three states to Rosen and other officials Meadows also sought to have Rosen investigate a conspiracy theory, promoted by a Giuliani ally, that satellites and military technology had been used in Italy to remotely change votes from Trump to Biden Trump also enlisted a private attorney, Kurt Olsen, to seek a meeting with Rosen to propose a legal challenge he had drafted; it was similar to a challenge initiated by Texas attorney general Ken Paxton and supported by dozens of Republican members of Congress and state attorneys general, that attempted unsuccessfully to have the Supreme Court reject election results in four states Trump also spoke to Rosen about Olsen's proposal Rosen and his deputy Richard Donoghue resisted the efforts, exchanging emails mocking them, in one case, as \"pure insanity\" [30] [356] [357] Rosen later testified to Congress, \"During my tenure, no special prosecutors were appointed, whether for election fraud or otherwise; no public statements were made questioning the election; no letters were sent to State officials seeking to overturn the election results;  [and] no DOJ court actions or filings were submitted seeking to overturn election results\" [358]\n\n\nPressure on Defense Department\nAccording to ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl, Michael Flynn called senior Trump intelligence official Ezra Cohen and told him to take extreme actions, including seizing ballots, to prevent the election results from favoring the Democrat Cohen didn't entertain Flynn's orders, responding, \"Sir, the election is over It's time to move on.\" Flynn replied, \"You're a quitter! This is not over! Don't be a quitter!\" [361] [362]\n\n\nPlan to seize voting machines\nThe then-President's team also developed plans to have federal authorities seize voting machines from states where the election had been closely contested but won by Biden News reports indicate that, at various points in the planning, the Justice Department, the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and the National Guard were considered as entities that would conduct the seizures Several versions of a draft Executive Order that would authorize the seizures were prepared Then-President Trump was reported to have reviewed the draft Executive Order authorizing seizure by the National Guard but, based on advice by (among others) Patrick Cipollone and Rudy Giuliani, he did not sign and issue it [322] [365]\n\n\nEllis memos\nOn New Year's Eve, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows sent a memo drafted by Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to a top Pence aide containing a detailed plan to overturn the election results The plan entailed Pence returning the electoral results to six battleground states on January 6, with a deadline of January 15 for the states to return them If any state did not return their electoral slate by that date, neither Trump nor Biden would hold a majority, so the election would be thrown to the House for a vote to determine the winner Per the Constitution, in such a scenario the vote would be conducted on the basis of party control of state legislatures, with Republicans holding 26 of 50, presumably giving Trump the victory [353]\n\n\nPlan to obtain National Security Agency data\nIn February 2022, The Washington Post obtained a memo of unknown provenance dated December 18, 2020, that had circulated among Trump allies and was shared with some Republican senators The memo called for Trump to direct acting defense secretary Christopher Miller to obtain \"NSA unprocessed raw signals data\" in an effort to prove foreign interference in the election The proposal called for Miller to direct three men named in the document to acquire the data At least two Republican senators received the memo after a January 4 meeting at the Trump International Hotel attended by at least three senators and others, which had been arranged by Mike Lindell The meeting centered around voting machines and alleged interference by China, Venezuela and other countries The three men involved were not close to Trump and their names had not been previously reported in efforts to subvert the election Miller said he was not aware of the memo and Trump did not act on it [363]\n\n\nJanuary 2021\nOn New Year's Day, White House director of personnel John McEntee sent a series of bullet points via text message to Pence's chief of staff to incorrectly assert that Thomas Jefferson \"Used His Position as VP to Win\" the 1801 election, which McEntee claimed \"proves that the VP has, at a minimum, a substantial discretion to address issues with the electoral process\" Jonathan Karl, the ABC News chief White House correspondent for the duration of the Trump administration, wrote a November 2021 profile of McEntee, characterizing him as particularly powerful because \"Trump knew he was the one person willing to do anything Trump wanted\" [368] [353]\n\n\nGohmert v. Pence\nOn December 27, 2020, Republican representative Louie Gohmert of Texas and the slate of Republican presidential electors for Arizona filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against Vice President Mike Pence, seeking to force him to decide the election outcome [379] [380] Gohmert argued that the Electoral Count Act of 1887 was unconstitutional, that the Constitution gave Vice President Pence the \"sole\" power to decide the election outcome, and that Pence had the power to \"count elector votes certified by a state's executive\", select \"a competing slate of duly qualified electors\", or \"ignore all electors from a certain state\" [379] [381] [382] Pence, represented by the Justice Department, moved to dismiss the case, since Congress, and not the vice president, was a more suitable defendant The Justice Department also argued that \"the Vice President – the only defendant in this case – is ironically the very person whose power  [plaintiffs] seek to promote A suit to establish that the Vice President has discretion over the count, filed against the Vice President, is a walking legal contradiction.\" [383] [384] Lawyers for Congress also supported Pence's position [384]\n\n\nCalls with state officials\nOn January 2, 2021, Trump, Giuliani, Eastman and others held a conference call with 300 legislators of key states to provide them purported evidence of election fraud to justify calling special sessions of their legislatures in an attempt to decertify their electors Three days later, dozens of lawmakers from five key states wrote Pence to ask he delay the January 6 final certification of electors for ten days to allow legislators the opportunity to reconsider their states' certifications [111]\n\n\nJustice Department pressured and efforts made to replace acting attorney general\nThe day after Attorney General William Barr said he intended to resign, Trump began to pressure his planned replacement, Jeffrey Rosen, to help him fight the election results In particular, Trump asked Rosen to file legal briefs supporting lawsuits against the election results; to announce Justice Department investigations of alleged serious election fraud; and to appoint special prosecutors to investigate Trump's unfounded allegations of voter fraud and accusations against Dominion Voting Systems [411] Rosen refused, as did his deputy, Richard Donoghue, as the Justice Department had already determined and announced that there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud [34] However, Trump continued to pressure them [411]\n\n\nPreparations by chief of staff\nDuring the days leading up to January 6, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows sent messages in support of preparing alternate Republican electors to replace those in some states in which Biden might win He also claimed in an email that the National Guard would be ready to \"protect pro Trump people\" [420]\n\n\nMore pressure on Pence\nIn early January 2021, Trump and his supporters continued to pressure Pence into aiding their attempts to overturn election results during the January 6 certification In early January, Trump criticized Pence for being \"too honest\" and warned him that people would \"hate\" him and believe he was \"stupid\" [425]\n\n\nJanuary 6 joint session\nIn December 2020, several Republican members of the House, led by Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama, [33] [434] as well as Republican senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, [435] declared that they would formally object to the counting of the electoral votes of five swing states won by Biden during the January 6, 2021, joint session [33] [376] [434] The objections would then trigger votes from both houses [376] At least 140 House Republicans reportedly planned to vote against the counting of electoral votes, despite the lack of any credible allegation of an irregularity that would have impacted the election, and the allegations' rejections by courts, election officials, the Electoral College and others, [33] and despite the fact that almost all of the Republican objectors had \"just won elections in the very same balloting they are now claiming was fraudulently administered\" [118]\n\n\nSenate efforts\nIn December 2020, several Republican members of the House, led by Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama, [33] [434] as well as Republican senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, [435] declared that they would formally object to the counting of the electoral votes of five swing states won by Biden during the January 6, 2021, joint session [33] [376] [434] The objections would then trigger votes from both houses [376] At least 140 House Republicans reportedly planned to vote against the counting of electoral votes, despite the lack of any credible allegation of an irregularity that would have impacted the election, and the allegations' rejections by courts, election officials, the Electoral College and others, [33] and despite the fact that almost all of the Republican objectors had \"just won elections in the very same balloting they are now claiming was fraudulently administered\" [118]\n\n\nHouse votes\nAt the January 6 session, after Republican senators had raised objections to Biden's electoral victory, the House debated and voted A majority of Republicans, totaling 139 and including Republican leader Kevin McCarthy and his deputy Steve Scalise, voted to support at least one objection [444] [445]\n\n\nReport by Rep. Zoe Lofgren\nAt the end of February 2021, Democratic Rep Zoe Lofgren, chair of the House Administration Committee, released a nearly 2,000-page report that examined the social media posts between election night and January 6 of Republican leaders who had voted against certifying the election results, writing \"Many of former President Trump's false statements were made in very public settings Had Members made similar public statements in the weeks and months before the January 6th attack? Statements which are readily available in the public arena may be part of any consideration of Congress' constitutional prerogatives and responsibilities.\" [446]\n\n\nCapitol attack\nStarting in December, Trump repeatedly encouraged his supporters to protest in Washington, D.C., on January 6 in support of his campaign to overturn the election results, [447] telling his supporters to \"Be there, will be wild!\" [448] The Washington Post editorial board criticized Trump for urging street protests, referring to previous violence by some Trump supporters at two rallies and his statement during a presidential debate telling the Proud Boys to \"stand back and stand by\" [449] Multiple groups of die-hard Trump supporters staged rallies in Washington on that day: Women for America First; the Eighty Percent Coalition (also at Freedom Plaza) (the group's name refers to the belief that approximately 80% of Trump voters do not accept the legitimacy of Biden's win); and \"The Silent Majority\" (a group organized by a South Carolina conservative activist) [447] [450] George Papadopoulos and Roger Stone, ardent allies of Trump, headlined some of the events In addition to the formally organized events, the Proud Boys, other far-right groups, and white supremacists vowed to descend on Washington on January 6, with some threatening violence and pledging to carry weapons [447] Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio said that his followers would \"be incognito\" and would \"spread across downtown DC in smaller teams\" [450] On January 4, Tarrio was arrested by District police on misdemeanor and felony charges [451]\n\n\nTrump operatives breach Coffee County, Georgia election system\nOn January 1, 2021, lawyers on Trump's team asked a Georgia tech firm to assist them in looking into voting systems in Coffee County, Georgia [465] On January 7, one of the fake electors in Georgia escorted two Trump operatives into the county's election office, and the Trump team copied data from the office [466]\n\n\nLindell memo\nOn January 15, Trump ally and My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell visited the White House, where he was photographed carrying notes that appeared to suggest an additional attempt to overturn the election [468] The document bore a heading containing the words \"taken immediately to save .. Constitution\" [469] and called for 780th Military Intelligence Brigade (Cyber) civilian lawyer [468] \"Frank Colon NOW as Acting National Security  [illegible]\", and mentioned the \"Insurrection Act\" and \"martial law\" [468] It further recommended \" [m]ov [ing] Kash Patel to CIA Acting\" [470] and made reference to Trump loyalist Sidney Powell [471]\n\n\nLater developments\nAccording to a Washington Post assessment published February 6, 2021, Trump's falsehoods about fraud had cost taxpayers more than half a billion dollars in spending to enhance security, resolve legal disputes and repair property, among other things [472]\n\n\nTaxpayer costs\nAccording to a Washington Post assessment published February 6, 2021, Trump's falsehoods about fraud had cost taxpayers more than half a billion dollars in spending to enhance security, resolve legal disputes and repair property, among other things [472]\n\n\nSecurity concerns over March 4, 2021\nSecurity was bolstered in Washington, D.C., in preparation for March 4, which QAnon adherents, adopting a false belief from sovereign citizen ideology, believed would be the day Trump was re-inaugurated as president [473] The House prematurely ended its work for the week following an announcement by the Capitol Police of intelligence on a \"possible plot\" by an identified militia group to breach the Capitol building on that day [474] Ultimately, March 4 passed without any serious incidents being reported.\n\n\nElection audits\nAlleging fraud, during 2021 Republicans initiated or proposed audits in several states, in addition to the election audits done normally in some states, which do not always include the presidency.\n\n\nArizona\nOn March 31, 2021, the Arizona Senate Republican caucus hired four firms to perform an audit of the presidential ballots in Maricopa County, with a Florida-based company called Cyber Ninjas being the lead firm [479] There was no stated purpose of overturning the election, and there is no mechanism under the Constitution by which the Congressional certification of the result could be reversed Arizona Senate President Karen Fann said that the audit was not intended to overturn the state's election results, including at a July 15 hearing [480] Nevertheless, Trump and some of his supporters expressed the hope that the Arizona result would be changed and that there might be a \"domino effect\" in which other states changed their results [481]\n\n\nGeorgia\nA group called VoterGA filed a lawsuit requesting to examine by microscope 150,000 Fulton County ballots that it asserted might be counterfeit The suit arose after four Republican auditors involved with the November 2020 statewide audit and manual recount claimed to see what they asserted were \"pristine\" absentee ballots which they suspected might have been computer-generated, though an October 2021 investigation by the Georgia secretary of state's office found that there were no counterfeit ballots in the batches named by the complainants [490] After an initial ruling in favor of the suit by a superior court judge in May 2021, it was ultimately dismissed in October because the plaintiffs \"failed to allege a particularized injury\" The dismissal of the suit marked the end of the last remaining lawsuit challenging the Georgia election results until another suit making largely the same argument was subsequently filed In December 2021, that suit was joined by David Perdue, who had announced his candidacy for Georgia governor days earlier Perdue lost his bid to be reelected as a United States senator in 2020 and asserted that he, like Trump, had been cheated [491] [492] [493] [494]\n\n\nIdaho\nIn September 2021, Bonner County, Idaho announced it would perform a recount of ballots cast in the election, in response to an allegation by election conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell that all 44 Idaho counties had been digitally hacked Lindell provided a detailed list of IP addresses he asserted had been compromised County Clerk Mike Rosedale stated that all county voting machines were fully airgapped from the Internet, also noting that seven Idaho counties don't use voting machines Lindell alleged that a specific formula had been applied by hackers to flip votes from Trump to Biden Rosedale said Lindell had not contacted his office before presenting his allegations [496] The Bonner audit, and audits of two other counties that don't use voting machines, affirmed the accuracy of the ballot count Chief Deputy Secretary of State Chad Houck said Lindell would be sent a bill for the audits [497] [498] [importance?]\n\n\nPennsylvania\nThe Republican Commissioners agreed to a ballot audit in Fulton County, PA due to a subpoena threat from State Senator Doug Mastriano [499] [500] Fulton County's audit was funded by Defending The Republic an organization founded by Trump's lawyer Sidney Powell [501] Defying a directive from the State's Board of Elections, the County allowed Wake Technology Services, Inc to access voting machines The company had originally performed the hand recount in Maricopa County's ballot audit [502] The original draft of its audit report concluded that Fulton's \"election was well run  [and] followed all Commonwealth and Federal guidelines.\" [499] At a state Senate hearing, the Republican chairman of Fulton County's Board of Commissioners testified that his county's audit found nothing wrong [503]\n\n\nTexas\nThe Texas attorney general's office, led by ardent Trump ally Ken Paxton, spent more than 22,000 staff hours investigating potential voting fraud in 2020 The investigation identified and prosecuted sixteen cases of false addresses on voter registration forms, among nearly 17 million registered voters in the state This was half as many cases as two years earlier A 2021 investigation found only three prosecutable cases among all elections in the state [510] [511]\n\n\nWisconsin\nBy May 2021, state election officials had identified 27 potential cases of voting fraud among 3.3 million ballots cast Sixteen of those cases involved people using a UPS Store rather than their residence for their

far-right actors try to claim election fraud since at least 2016, but it didn't take off When Trump started telling the 'big lie,' it became a big issue in Germany, sometimes bigger than the pandemic,

The election was widely observed to be one of the most secure in American history, with numerous safeguards in place to prevent voter fraud. Despite this, Trump and his allies launched a series of efforts to overturn the election results, claiming without evidence that the election had been \"stolen\" or \"rigged.\"\n\n**Background**\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2012 presidential election, in which incumbent president Barack Obama won re-election against Mitt Romney, Donald Trump tweeted that \"The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy\", that the election was a \"total sham\", and that the United States was \"not a democracy\". This marked the beginning of a long-standing narrative from Trump that the electoral process was inherently corrupt and susceptible to manipulation.\n\n**Trump's 2012 Accusations of Electoral Fraud**\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2012 presidential election, Trump made several public statements suggesting that the election had been rigged against him. Trump tweeted that the electoral college was \"a disaster for a democracy\", that the election was a \"total sham\", and that the United States was \"not a democracy\". Trump also claimed that the election had been \"totally rigged\" and that he would have won the election if it had not been for voter fraud. These claims were widely debunked by fact-checkers and election officials.\n\n**Uncertainty over Trump Accepting an Electoral Loss in 2016**\n\nIn the 2016 presidential election, Trump repeatedly suggested that the election was \"rigged\" against him, and in the final debate, he cast doubt on whether he would accept the results of the election if he lost. Trump's comments touched off a media and political uproar, with many accusing him of \"threatening to upend a fundamental pillar of American democracy\" and raising the prospect that millions of his supporters may not accept the results on November 8.\n\n**Uncertainty over Trump Accepting an Electoral Loss in 2020**\n\nDuring the 2020 campaign, Trump indicated in Twitter posts, interviews, and speeches that he might refuse to recognize the outcome of the election if he were defeated. Trump falsely suggested that the election would be rigged against him. In July 2020, Trump declined to state whether he would accept the results, telling Fox News anchor Chris Wallace that \"I have to see No, I'm not going to just say yes I'm not going to say no.\" Trump also proposed delaying the presidential election due to COVID-19, until Americans could vote \"properly, securely and safely.\"\n\n**Refusal to Accept 2020 Electoral Loss**\n\nAt 2 am on Wednesday, November 4, 2020, with the election results still unclear, Trump held a press conference at the White House in which he stated: \"This is a fraud on the American public This is an embarrassment to our country We were getting ready to win this election Frankly, we did win this election.\" The statement was condemned as false almost immediately. The statement was also described as having been months in the making.\n\n**After Results Declared**\n\nIn the months between the election and Inauguration Day (January 20), Trump engaged in multiple efforts to overturn the results. He filed numerous lawsuits, urged local and state authorities to overturn the results in their jurisdiction, pressed the Justice Department to verify unsupported claims of election fraud, and worked with congressional allies to get the results overturned in Congress on January 6.\n\n**Since Leaving Office**\n\nSince leaving office, Trump has continued to insist that he won the 2020 election. He reportedly dislikes the term \"former president\", and his official statements refer to him as \"the 45th President\" or simply as \"45\", as on his new website, www.45office.com. During public speeches, he insists that massive election fraud caused his loss, saying, \"This was the scam of the century and this was the crime of the century\" and \"We won the election twice  and it's possible we'll have to win it a third time .\"\n\n**Refusal to Accept 2020 Electoral Loss by Trump's Allies and Supporters**\n\nThe Stolen Election movement, a far-right and conservative campaign and protest movement in the United States, promoted the conspiracy theory that widespread electoral fraud occurred during the 2020 presidential election to deny incumbent president Donald Trump victory over former vice president Joe Biden. Trump and his supporters asserted, without evidence, that he is the winner of the election, and that large-scale voter and vote counting fraud took place in several swing states. The 2020 United States presidential election was widely observed to be one of the most secure in American history, with numerous safeguards in place to prevent voter fraud.\n\n**Planning for Congress to Overturn the Election on January 6**\n\nOn December 21, Congressman Mo Brooks, who had been the first member of Congress to announce he would object to the January 6, 2021 certification of the Electoral College results, organized three White House meetings between Trump, Republican lawmakers, and others. Attendees included Trump, Vice President Pence, representatives Jody Hice (R-Ga.), Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), and Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), representative-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), and members of the Trump legal team. The purpose of the meetings was to strategize about how Congress could overturn the election results on January 6.\n\n**Pressure on Pence**\n\nIn the run-up to election certification on January 6, attempts to uncover significant election fraud bore no fruit and related legal challenges were rejected by the courts. Hence, those seeking to overturn the election focused attention increasingly on then-vice-president Mike Pence. The Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires the President of the Senate, which was Pence for the January 6 certification of the presidential election, to supervise the counting of electoral ballots at a joint session of the Congress.\n\n**\"Pence Card\" Conspiracy**\n\nJohn Eastman, author of the Eastman memos, began working with the Trump team in November 2020. Trump adviser Peter Navarro claimed that the \"Green Bay Sweep\" plan was developed over weeks prior to January 6, 2021. The plan entailed Pence returning the electoral results to six battleground states on January 6, with a deadline of January 15 for the states to return them. If any state did not return their electoral slate by that date, neither Trump nor Biden would hold a majority, so the election would be thrown to the House for a vote to determine the winner.\n\n**Justice Department Pressured and Efforts Made to Replace Acting Attorney General**\n\nThe day after Attorney General William Barr said he intended to resign, Trump began to pressure his planned replacement, Jeffrey Rosen, to help him fight the election results. In particular, Trump asked Rosen to file legal briefs supporting lawsuits against the election results; to announce Justice Department investigations of alleged serious election fraud; and to appoint special prosecutors to investigate Trump's unfounded allegations of voter fraud and accusations against Dominion Voting Systems.\n\n**Preparations by Chief of Staff**\n\nDuring the days leading up to January 6, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows sent messages in support of preparing alternate Republican electors to replace those in some states in which Biden might win. Meadows also claimed in an email that the National Guard would be ready to \"protect pro Trump people.\"\n\n**House Votes**\n\nAt the January 6 session, after Republican senators had raised objections to Biden's electoral victory, the House debated and voted. A majority of Republicans, totaling 139 and including Republican leader Kevin McCarthy and his deputy Steve Scalise, voted to support at least one objection.\n\n**Report by Rep. Zoe Lofgren**\n\nAt the end of February 2021, Democratic Rep Zoe Lofgren, chair of the House Administration Committee, released a nearly 2,000-page report that examined the social media posts between election night and January 6 of Republican leaders who had voted against certifying the election results, writing \"Many of former President Trump's false statements were made in very public settings Had Members made similar public statements in the weeks and months before the January 6th attack? Statements which are readily available in the public arena may be part of any consideration of Congress' constitutional prerogatives and responsibilities.\"\n\n**Capitol Attack**\n\nStarting in December, Trump repeatedly encouraged his supporters to protest in Washington, D.C., on January 6 in support of his campaign to overturn the election results, telling his supporters to \"Be there, will be wild!\" The Washington Post editorial board criticized Trump for urging street protests, referring to previous violence by some Trump supporters at two rallies and his statement during a presidential debate telling the Proud Boys to \"stand back and stand by.\"\n\n**Election Audits**\n\nNumerous claims were made that serious anomalies could be found in the 2020 election results, suggesting an election fraud. However, a paper entitled \"No Evidence For Voter Fraud: A Guide To Statistical Claims About The 2020 Election\" written by Justin Grimmer, Haritz Garro and Andrew C Eggers, was published by the conservative Hoover Institution (February 3, 2021) concluded that the statistics used to \"claim some election facts would be unlikely if there had been no fraud\" were either not accurate in the first place or if they were accurate, weren't really surprising.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nDr Eastman and President Trump launched a campaign to overturn a democratic election, an action unprecedented in American history. Their campaign was not confined to the ivory tower – it was a coup in search of a legal theory. If Dr Eastman and President Trump's plan had worked, it would have permanently ended the peaceful transition of power, undermining American democracy and the Constitution. If the country does not commit to investigating and pursuing accountability for those responsible, the Court fears January 6 will repeat itself.\n\n**Administration Dissenters**\n\nHope Hicks told Trump to \"move on\" Trump replied, \"Well, Hope doesn't believe in me\" Hicks said, \"No, I don't Nobody's convinced me otherwise.\"\n\n**Consistent Critics**\n\nIn 2021, The Republican Accountability Project estimated that 6% of national Republicans politicians consistently stood-up for democracy. Other prominent Republicans who spoke out against attempts to subvert the election results included Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland, former House Speaker Paul Ryan, and Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-highest-ranking Republican in the House. Former Republican governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, wrote in The Economist that \"President Donald Trump's actions to destroy faith in our elections and throw centuries of American principles out the window must be met with universal condemnation from all political leaders, regardless of party.\"\n\n**Others**\n\nAt least eight sitting Republican senators, members of the second

election\" [164] Another is Italygate, a QAnon-adjacent [165] [166] theory originating from a fake news website, which claimed that the election was rigged in Biden's favor by the U.S Embassy in Rome, using satellites and military technology to remotely switch votes from Trump to Biden There is no evidence to support this [165] [167] Republican congressman Scott Perry texted White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows a link to a YouTube video making the allegation [165] [168] The New York Times later reported that, during Trump's last weeks in office, Meadows emailed the video to the Department of Justice, seeking an investigation [169]\n\n\nNovember 2020\nOn at least one occasion in November 2020, Trump privately acknowledged that he lost the election Alyssa Farah Griffin, a White House

[202]\n\n\nLawsuits\nAfter the 2020 United States presidential election, the campaign for incumbent president Donald Trump filed a number of lawsuits contesting election processes, vote-counting, and the vote-certification process in multiple states, including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin [215] Many such cases were quickly dismissed, [100] and lawyers and other observers noted that the lawsuits were unlikely to have an effect on the outcome of the election [216] [217] [218] By November 19, more than two dozen of the legal challenges filed since

certification along party lines with the two Republican members refusing to certify, but on November 17 the board voted unanimously to certify its results [221] Trump and Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel called the two Republican members of the board that day to pressure them to not sign the official statement of votes; the next day the two Republicans sought but failed to rescind their votes for certification, signing affidavits stating that they had voted for certification only because the two Democratic members had promised a full audit of the county's votes [222] [223] The two denied Trump's call had influenced their reversal [224] A recording of the phone call surfaced in December 2023, on which McDaniel can be heard telling the two Republicans, \"We will get you

experts have said the conclusion was false and the report \"critically flawed\" [233]\n\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State pressured to disqualify ballots\nThe 2020 United States presidential election in Georgia produced an initial count wherein Biden defeated Trump by around 14,000 votes, triggering an automatic recount due to the small margin On November 13, 2020, while the recount was ongoing, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina privately called Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to discuss Georgia's vote counting [104] [235] Raffensperger, a Republican, told The Washington Post that Graham had asked whether Raffensperger could disqualify all mail-in ballots in counties that had more signature errors [104] Gabriel Sterling, a Republican election official and staffer to Raffensperger, was present for the call, and Sterling confirmed that Graham had asked that question [236]\n\n\nWisconsin recount-obstruction\nOn November 5, 2020, Andrew Iverson, head of Trump's Wisconsin campaign, told other campaign operatives in a strategy session: \"Here's the deal: Comms is going to continue to fan the flame and get the word out about Democrats trying to steal this election We'll do whatever they need Just be on standby if there's any stunts we need to pull.\" [e] [238]\n\n\nPartisan hearings with Republican legislatures\nOn November 25, 2020, one day after Pennsylvania certified its election results, a Republican state senator requested a hearing of the State Senate Majority Policy Committee to discuss election issues The event, described as an \"informational meeting\", was held at a hotel in Gettysburg and featured Rudy Giuliani asserting that the election had been subject to massive fraud Trump also spoke to the group by speakerphone, repeating his false claim that he had actually won in Pennsylvania and other swing states, and saying \"We have to turn the election over\" [241]\n\n\nConspiracy allegations\nDays before the 2020 presidential election, Dennis Montgomery, a software designer with a history of making dubious claims, asserted that a program called Scorecard, running on a government supercomputer called Hammer, would be used to switch votes from Trump to Biden on voting machines Trump legal team attorney Sidney Powell promoted the conspiracy theory on Lou Dobbs Tonight on November 6, [244] [245] and again two days later on Maria Bartiromo's Fox Business program, claiming to have \"evidence that that is exactly what happened\" [245] She also asserted that the CIA ignored warnings about the software, and urged Trump to fire director Gina Haspel [246] Christopher Krebs, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), characterized the supercomputer claim as \"nonsense\" and a \"hoax\" CISA described the 2020 election as \"the most secure in American history\", with \"no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes or was in any way compromised\" [245] [247] A few days later, Trump fired Krebs by tweet, claiming that Krebs' analysis was \"highly inaccurate\" [248]\n\n\nThreats of violence by Trump supporters\nAfter Biden won the election, angry Trump supporters threatened election officials, election officials' family members, and elections staff in at least eight states via emails, telephone calls and letters; some of the menacing and vitriolic communications included death threats Officials terrorized by the threats included officials in the swing states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada, and Arizona, as well as a few less competitive states [275] Some officials had to seek police protection [275] [276] or move from their homes due to the threats [275] The director of the nonpartisan, nonprofit Center for Election Innovation & Research, described the threats as frightening and said, \"These threats often go into areas related to race or sex or anti-Semitism More than once they specifically refer to gun violence.\" Prominent Republicans ignored or said little about the threats of violence [275]\n\n\nDecember 2020\nOn December 1, 2020, U.S Attorney General William Barr said U.S attorneys and FBI agents had investigated complaints and allegations of fraud, but found none of significance [34] [97] [285] [286] On December 3, 2020, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said no evidence had yet been found of foreign interference [287] [288]\n\n\nTrump's attempt to pressure state officials\nOn December 5, Trump placed a call to Georgia governor Brian Kemp in which he urged the governor to call a special session of the state legislature to override the election results and appoint electors who would support Trump [108] He also called the Pennsylvania speaker of the house with similar objectives, and had earlier invited Michigan Republican state officials to the White House to discuss election results in that state [108] [290] The Georgia and Pennsylvania contacts were made after Biden's victories had been certified in those states; Biden's Michigan victory was certified three days after the Trump White House meeting [109] [110] [291]\n\n\nSupreme Court petitions\nBefore and after the election, Trump said he expected the outcome would be decided by the Supreme Court, where conservative justices held a 6–3 majority, with three of the justices having been appointed by Trump [304] [130]\n\n\nConsideration of special counsel and martial law\nAfter legal efforts by Trump and his proxies had failed in numerous state and federal courts, including the Supreme Court, [312] some right-wing activists and Trump allies – including Michael Flynn, Sidney Powell, and L Lin Wood – suggested that Trump could suspend the Constitution, declare martial law and \"rerun\" the election [313] [314] Many retired military officers, attorneys, and other commentators expressed horror at such a notion [315] [f] Trump held an Oval Office meeting on December 18 with Rudy Giuliani, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, Powell, and Flynn At the meeting, Trump entertained the idea of naming Powell, who has promoted election conspiracy theories and falsehoods, as special counsel to investigate election matters, though most advisors in attendance strongly opposed the idea Two executive orders were drafted to appoint a special counsel and confiscate voting machines, which Trump falsely claimed were rigged against him One order called for the Pentagon to seize machines, while the other tasked the Department of Homeland Security At Trump's direction, Giuliani called Ken Cuccinelli, the second in command at DHS, on December 17 to ask if the department could seize the machines, but Cuccinelli said it did not have the authority On Giuliani's advice, Trump had rejected a recommendation from Flynn and Powell to have the Pentagon seize the machines, and Bill Barr flatly rejected the president's suggestion that the Justice Department do it [320] [51] [321] [322] Flynn reportedly discussed his idea to declare martial law, although others also resisted that idea, and Trump's opinion on the matter was unclear That same day, Flynn appeared on Newsmax TV to suggest that Trump had the power to deploy the military to \"rerun\" the election in the swing states that Trump had lost [312] Trump dismissed reports about a discussion of martial law as \"fake news\", but it remained unclear whether he had endorsed the notion [323]\n\n\nPlanning for Congress to overturn the election on January 6\nOn December 21, Congressman Mo Brooks, who had been the first member of Congress to announce he would object to the January 6, 2021 certification of the Electoral College results, [328] [329] organized three White House meetings between Trump, Republican lawmakers, and others Attendees included Trump, Vice President Pence, representatives Jody Hice (R-Ga.), Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), and Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), representative-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), and members of the Trump legal team The purpose of the meetings was to strategize about how Congress could overturn the election results on January 6 Brooks confirmed after one such meeting that it had been \"a back-and-forth concerning the planning and strategy for January the 6th.\" [330]\n\n\nPressure on Pence\nIn the run-up to election certification on January 6, attempts to uncover significant election fraud bore no fruit and related legal challenges were rejected by the courts Hence, those seeking to overturn the election focused attention increasingly on then-vice-president Mike Pence The Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires the President of the Senate, which was Pence for the January 6 certification of the presidential election, to supervise the counting of electoral ballots at a joint session of the Congress [332] The Trump team developed multiple theories about how the Vice President might act on January 6 to aid the overturning of election results; and repeatedly encouraged him to act accordingly [citation needed]\n\n\n\"Pence Card\" conspiracy\n\n\n\nDecember timeline\nJohn Eastman, author of the Eastman memos, began working with the Trump team in November 2020 [347] Trump adviser Peter Navarro claimed that the \"Green Bay Sweep\" plan was developed over weeks prior to January 6, 2021 [348]\n\n\nPressure on Justice Department\nOn December 14, two weeks after Barr stated there was no evidence of significant election fraud, Trump announced that Barr would be leaving as attorney general by Christmas [34] [355] Before Trump's announcement, he enlisted Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and other aides to pressure deputy attorney general Jeffrey Rosen, who would replace Barr on December 23, and other Justice Department officials to challenge the election results Meadows and a top Trump aide emailed allegations of voting anomalies in three states to Rosen and other officials Meadows also sought to have Rosen investigate a conspiracy theory, promoted by a Giuliani ally, that satellites and military technology had been used in Italy to remotely change votes from Trump to Biden Trump also enlisted a private attorney, Kurt Olsen, to seek a meeting with Rosen to propose a legal challenge he had drafted; it was similar to a challenge initiated by Texas attorney general Ken Paxton and supported by dozens of Republican members of Congress and state attorneys general, that attempted unsuccessfully to have the Supreme Court reject election results in four states Trump also spoke to Rosen about Olsen's proposal Rosen and his deputy Richard Donoghue resisted the efforts, exchanging emails mocking them, in one case, as \"pure insanity\" [30] [356] [357] Rosen later testified to Congress, \"During my tenure, no special prosecutors were appointed, whether for election fraud or otherwise; no public statements were made questioning the election; no letters were sent to State officials seeking to overturn the election results;  [and] no DOJ court actions or filings were submitted seeking to overturn election results\" [358]\n\n\nPressure on Defense Department\nAccording to ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl, Michael Flynn called senior Trump intelligence official Ezra Cohen and told him to take extreme actions, including seizing ballots, to prevent the election results from favoring the Democrat Cohen didn't entertain Flynn's orders, responding, \"Sir, the election is over It's time to move on.\" Flynn replied, \"You're a quitter! This is not over! Don't be a quitter!\" [361] [362]\n\n\nPlan to seize voting machines\nThe then-President's team also developed plans to have federal authorities seize voting machines from states where the election had been closely contested but won by Biden News reports indicate that, at various points in the planning, the Justice Department, the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and the National Guard were considered as entities that would conduct the seizures Several versions of a draft Executive Order that would authorize the seizures were prepared Then-President Trump was reported to have reviewed the draft Executive Order authorizing seizure by the National Guard but, based on advice by (among others) Patrick Cipollone and Rudy Giuliani, he did not sign and issue it [322] [365]\n\n\nEllis memos\nOn New Year's Eve, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows sent a memo drafted by Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to a top Pence aide containing a detailed plan to overturn the election results The plan entailed Pence returning the electoral results to six battleground states on January 6, with a deadline of January 15 for the states to return them If any state did not return their electoral slate by that date, neither Trump nor Biden would hold a majority, so the election would be thrown to the House for a vote to determine the winner Per the Constitution, in such a scenario the vote would be conducted on the basis of party control of state legislatures, with Republicans holding 26 of 50, presumably giving Trump the victory [353]\n\n\nPlan to obtain National Security Agency data\nIn February 2022, The Washington Post obtained a memo of unknown provenance dated December 18, 2020, that had circulated among Trump allies and was shared with some Republican senators The memo called for Trump to direct acting defense secretary Christopher Miller to obtain \"NSA unprocessed raw signals data\" in an effort to prove foreign interference in the election The proposal called for Miller to direct three men named in the document to acquire the data At least two Republican senators received the memo after a January 4 meeting at the Trump International Hotel attended by at least three senators and others, which had been arranged by Mike Lindell The meeting centered around voting machines and alleged interference by China, Venezuela and other countries The three men involved were not close to Trump and their names had not been previously reported in efforts to subvert the election Miller said he was not aware of the memo and Trump did not act on it [363]\n\n\nJanuary 2021\nOn New Year's Day, White House director of personnel John McEntee sent a series of bullet points via text message to Pence's chief of staff to incorrectly assert that Thomas Jefferson \"Used His Position as VP to Win\" the 1801 election, which McEntee claimed \"proves that the VP has, at a minimum, a substantial discretion to address issues with the electoral process\" Jonathan Karl, the ABC News chief White House correspondent for the duration of the Trump administration, wrote a November 2021 profile of McEntee, characterizing him as particularly powerful because \"Trump knew he was the one person willing to do anything Trump wanted\" [368] [353]\n\n\nGohmert v. Pence\nOn December 27, 2020, Republican representative Louie Gohmert of Texas and the slate of Republican presidential electors for Arizona filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against Vice President Mike Pence, seeking to force him to decide the election outcome [379] [380] Gohmert argued that the Electoral Count Act of 1887 was unconstitutional, that the Constitution gave Vice President Pence the \"sole\" power to decide the election outcome, and that Pence had the power to \"count elector votes certified by a state's executive\", select \"a competing slate of duly qualified electors\", or \"ignore all electors from a certain state\" [379] [381] [382] Pence, represented by the Justice Department, moved to dismiss the case, since Congress, and not the vice president, was a more suitable defendant The Justice Department also argued that \"the Vice President – the only defendant in this case – is ironically the very person whose power  [plaintiffs] seek to promote A suit to establish that the Vice President has discretion over the count, filed against the Vice President, is a walking legal contradiction.\" [383] [384] Lawyers for Congress also supported Pence's position [384]\n\n\nCalls with state officials\nOn January 2, 2021, Trump, Giuliani, Eastman and others held a conference call with 300 legislators of key states to provide them purported evidence of election fraud to justify calling special sessions of their legislatures in an attempt to decertify their electors Three days later, dozens of lawmakers from five key states wrote Pence to ask he delay the January 6 final certification of electors for ten days to allow legislators the opportunity to reconsider their states' certifications [111]\n\n\nJustice Department pressured and efforts made to replace acting attorney general\nThe day after Attorney General William Barr said he intended to resign, Trump began to pressure his planned replacement, Jeffrey Rosen, to help him fight the election results In particular, Trump asked Rosen to file legal briefs supporting lawsuits against the election results; to announce Justice Department investigations of alleged serious election fraud; and to appoint special prosecutors to investigate Trump's unfounded allegations of voter fraud and accusations against Dominion Voting Systems [411] Rosen refused, as did his deputy, Richard Donoghue, as the Justice Department had already determined and announced that there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud [34] However, Trump continued to pressure them [411]\n\n\nPreparations by chief of staff\nDuring the days leading up to January 6, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows sent messages in support of preparing alternate Republican electors to replace those in some states in which Biden might win He also claimed in an email that the National Guard would be ready to \"protect pro Trump people\" [420]\n\n\nMore pressure on Pence\nIn early January 2021, Trump and his supporters continued to pressure Pence into aiding their attempts to overturn election results during the January 6 certification In early January, Trump criticized Pence for being \"too honest\" and warned him that people would \"hate\" him and believe he was \"stupid\" [425]\n\n\nJanuary 6 joint session\nIn December 2020, several Republican members of the House, led by Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama, [33] [434] as well as Republican senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, [435] declared that they would formally object to the counting of the electoral votes of five swing states won by Biden during the January 6, 2021, joint session [33] [376] [434] The objections would then trigger votes from both houses [376] At least 140 House Republicans reportedly planned to vote against the counting of electoral votes, despite the lack of any credible allegation of an irregularity that would have impacted the election, and the allegations' rejections by courts, election officials, the Electoral College and others, [33] and despite the fact that almost all of the Republican objectors had \"just won elections in the very same balloting they are now claiming was fraudulently administered\" [118]\n\n\nSenate efforts\nIn December 2020, several Republican members of the House, led by Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama, [33] [434] as well as Republican senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, [435] declared that they would formally object to the counting of the electoral votes of five swing states won by Biden during the January 6, 2021, joint session [33] [376] [434] The objections would then trigger votes from both houses [376] At least 140 House Republicans reportedly planned to vote against the counting of electoral votes, despite the lack of any credible allegation of an irregularity that would have impacted the election, and the allegations' rejections by courts, election officials, the Electoral College and others, [33] and despite the fact that almost all of the Republican objectors had \"just won elections in the very same balloting they are now claiming was fraudulently administered\" [118]\n\n\nHouse votes\nAt the January 6 session, after Republican senators had raised objections to Biden's electoral victory, the House debated and voted A majority of Republicans, totaling 139 and including Republican leader Kevin McCarthy and his deputy Steve Scalise, voted to support at least one objection [444] [445]\n\n\nReport by Rep. Zoe Lofgren\nAt the end of February 2021, Democratic Rep Zoe Lofgren, chair of the House Administration Committee, released a nearly 2,000-page report that examined the social media posts between election night and January 6 of Republican leaders who had voted against certifying the election results, writing \"Many of former President Trump's false statements were made in very public settings Had Members made similar public statements in the weeks and months before the January 6th attack? Statements which are readily available in the public arena may be part of any consideration of Congress' constitutional prerogatives and responsibilities.\" [446]\n\n\nCapitol attack\nStarting in December, Trump repeatedly encouraged his supporters to protest in Washington, D.C., on January 6 in support of his campaign to overturn the election results, [447] telling his supporters to \"Be there, will be wild!\" [448] The Washington Post editorial board criticized Trump for urging street protests, referring to previous violence by some Trump supporters at two rallies and his statement during a presidential debate telling the Proud Boys to \"stand back and stand by\" [449] Multiple groups of die-hard Trump supporters staged rallies in Washington on that day: Women for America First; the Eighty Percent Coalition (also at Freedom Plaza) (the group's name refers to the belief that approximately 80% of Trump voters do not accept the legitimacy of Biden's win); and \"The Silent Majority\" (a group organized by a South Carolina conservative activist) [447] [450] George Papadopoulos and Roger Stone, ardent allies of Trump, headlined some of the events In addition to the formally organized events, the Proud Boys, other far-right groups, and white supremacists vowed to descend on Washington on January 6, with some threatening violence and pledging to carry weapons [447] Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio said that his followers would \"be incognito\" and would \"spread across downtown DC in smaller teams\" [450] On January 4, Tarrio was arrested by District police on misdemeanor and felony charges [451]\n\n\nTrump operatives breach Coffee County, Georgia election system\nOn January 1, 2021, lawyers on Trump's team asked a Georgia tech firm to assist them in looking into voting systems in Coffee County, Georgia [465] On January 7, one of the fake electors in Georgia escorted two Trump operatives into the county's election office, and the Trump team copied data from the office [466]\n\n\nLindell memo\nOn January 15, Trump ally and My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell visited the White House, where he was photographed carrying notes that appeared to suggest an additional attempt to overturn the election [468] The document bore a heading containing the words \"taken immediately to save .. Constitution\" [469] and called for 780th Military Intelligence Brigade (Cyber) civilian lawyer [468] \"Frank Colon NOW as Acting National Security  [illegible]\", and mentioned the \"Insurrection Act\" and \"martial law\" [468] It further recommended \" [m]ov [ing] Kash Patel to CIA Acting\" [470] and made reference to Trump loyalist Sidney Powell [471]\n\n\nLater developments\nAccording to a Washington Post assessment published February 6, 2021, Trump's falsehoods about fraud had cost taxpayers more than half a billion dollars in spending to enhance security, resolve legal disputes and repair property, among other things [472]\n\n\nTaxpayer costs\nAccording to a Washington Post assessment published February 6, 2021, Trump's falsehoods about fraud had cost taxpayers more than half a billion dollars in spending to enhance security, resolve legal disputes and repair property, among other things [472]\n\n\nSecurity concerns over March 4, 2021\nSecurity was bolstered in Washington, D.C., in preparation for March 4, which QAnon adherents, adopting a false belief from sovereign citizen ideology, believed would be the day Trump was re-inaugurated as president [473] The House prematurely ended its work for the week following an announcement by the Capitol Police of intelligence on a \"possible plot\" by an identified militia group to breach the Capitol building on that day [474] Ultimately, March 4 passed without any serious incidents being reported.\n\n\nElection audits\nAlleging fraud, during 2021 Republicans initiated or proposed audits in several states, in addition to the election audits done normally in some states, which do not always include the presidency.\n\n\nArizona\nOn March 31, 2021, the Arizona Senate Republican caucus hired four firms to perform an audit of the presidential ballots in Maricopa County, with a Florida-based company called Cyber Ninjas being the lead firm [479] There was no stated purpose of overturning the election, and there is no mechanism under the Constitution by which the Congressional certification of the result could be reversed Arizona Senate President Karen Fann said that the audit was not intended to overturn the state's election results, including at a July 15 hearing [480] Nevertheless, Trump and some of his supporters expressed the hope that the Arizona result would be changed and that there might be a \"domino effect\" in which other states changed their results [481]\n\n\nGeorgia\nA group called VoterGA filed a lawsuit requesting to examine by microscope 150,000 Fulton County ballots that it asserted might be counterfeit The suit arose after four Republican auditors involved with the November 2020 statewide audit and manual recount claimed to see what they asserted were \"pristine\" absentee ballots which they suspected might have been computer-generated, though an October 2021 investigation by the Georgia secretary of state's office found that there were no counterfeit ballots in the batches named by the complainants [490] After an initial ruling in favor of the suit by a superior court judge in May 2021, it was ultimately dismissed in October because the plaintiffs \"failed to allege a particularized injury\" The dismissal of the suit marked the end of the last remaining lawsuit challenging the Georgia election results until another suit making largely the same argument was subsequently filed In December 2021, that suit was joined by David Perdue, who had announced his candidacy for Georgia governor days earlier Perdue lost his bid to be reelected as a United States senator in 2020 and asserted that he, like Trump, had been cheated [491] [492] [493] [494]\n\n\nIdaho\nIn September 2021, Bonner County, Idaho announced it would perform a recount of ballots cast in the election, in response to an allegation by election conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell that all 44 Idaho counties had been digitally hacked Lindell provided a detailed list of IP addresses he asserted had been compromised County Clerk Mike Rosedale stated that all county voting machines were fully airgapped from the Internet, also noting that seven Idaho counties don't use voting machines Lindell alleged that a specific formula had been applied by hackers to flip votes from Trump to Biden Rosedale said Lindell had not contacted his office before presenting his allegations [496] The Bonner audit, and audits of two other counties that don't use voting machines, affirmed the accuracy of the ballot count Chief Deputy Secretary of State Chad Houck said Lindell would be sent a bill for the audits [497] [498] [importance?]\n\n\nPennsylvania\nThe Republican Commissioners agreed to a ballot audit in Fulton County, PA due to a subpoena threat from State Senator Doug Mastriano [499] [500] Fulton County's audit was funded by Defending The Republic an organization founded by Trump's lawyer Sidney Powell [501] Defying a directive from the State's Board of Elections, the County allowed Wake Technology Services, Inc to access voting machines The company had originally performed the hand recount in Maricopa County's ballot audit [502] The original draft of its audit report concluded that Fulton's \"election was well run  [and] followed all Commonwealth and Federal guidelines.\" [499] At a state Senate hearing, the Republican chairman of Fulton County's Board of Commissioners testified that his county's audit found nothing wrong [503]\n\n\nTexas\nThe Texas attorney general's office, led by ardent Trump ally Ken Paxton, spent more than 22,000 staff hours investigating potential voting fraud in 2020 The investigation identified and prosecuted sixteen cases of false addresses on voter registration forms, among nearly 17 million registered voters in the state This was half as many cases as two years earlier A 2021 investigation found only three prosecutable cases among all elections in the state [510] [511]\n\n\nWisconsin\nBy May 2021, state election officials had identified 27 potential cases of voting fraud among 3.3 million ballots cast Sixteen of those cases involved people using a UPS Store rather than their residence for their mailing address [515]\n\n\nMike Lindell reinstatement prediction\nOn March 29, 2021, businessman and Trump supporter Mike Lindell predicted on Steve Bannon's podcast that Trump would be back in office on \"August 13\", the day after his three-day cyber fraud conference in Sioux Falls, stating \"it'll be the talk of the world\" When President Joe Biden remained in office, Lindell moved his prediction for Trump's return to September 30, and then to the end of 2021 [526] [527]\n\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee report\nOn October 7, 2021, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary published their report on Trump's efforts to pressure the Department of Justice to overturn the results of the 2020 election [528]\n\n\nElection law reform efforts\nThe controversies surrounding the election prompted calls to improve federal election laws The Democratic led House of Representatives passed the For the People Act on March 3, 2019, but it was blocked from being heard in the Republican-led Senate by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell [529] [original research?]\n\n\nPost-election voter restriction efforts by Republicans\nIn multiple U.S states, officials who work for the secretary of state received threats following the election and were still receiving threats as of October 2021 Law enforcement generally was not prepared to provide ongoing security for these officials, as their positions had never before been considered high-risk [543]\n\n\nImpact on secretaries of state\nIn multiple U.S states, officials who work for the secretary of state received threats following the election and were still receiving threats as of October 2021 Law enforcement generally was not prepared to provide ongoing security for these officials, as their positions had never before been considered high-risk [543]\n\n\nHouse Select Committee on the January 6 Attack\nIn July 2021, the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack was formed, largely along party lines [544]\n\n\n2021 German federal election\nDuring the 2021 German federal election, the Center for Monitoring, Analysis and Strategy (CeMAS) found that false claims of voter fraud had become commonplace on Telegram in Germany, with accusations against Dominion Voting Systems being common despite the company's technology not being used in German elections [h] CeMAS researcher Miro Dittrich said, \"We have seen far-right actors try to claim election fraud since at least 2016, but it didn't take off When Trump started telling the 'big lie,' it became a big issue in Germany, sometimes bigger than the pandemic, because far-right groups and the AfD are carefully monitoring the success Trump is having with this narrative.\" [551]\n\n\nJustice Department investigations\nBy March 2022, Justice Department investigations of participants in the Capitol attack had expanded to include activities of Trump's inner circle leading up to the attack A federal grand jury was empaneled that issued at least one subpoena seeking records about people who organized, spoke at, or provided security at Trump rallies, as well as information about members of the executive and legislative branches who may have taken part in planning or executing the rallies, or attempted to \"obstruct, influence, impede or delay\" the certification of the election [552] [553]\n\n\nCivil lawsuits\nIn May 2022, a civil lawsuit was filed in Dane County, Wisconsin, against the ten Trump supporters who had presented themselves as alternate electors for that state [554]\n\n\nContinuing subversion efforts and 2024 predictions\nAs of 2024, Trump has publicly continued to insist that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen, while still providing no evidence [555] It has been reported that Trump had admitted his loss to a group of historians in mid-2021, saying, \"We had a deal all set, and then when the election was rigged and lost, what happened is that the deal went away\" [60]\n\n\nPost-election allegations of statistical improbabilities\nIn the aftermath of the election, numerous claims were made and began to circulate, stating that serious anomalies could be found, suggesting an election fraud However, a paper entitled \"No Evidence For Voter Fraud: A Guide To Statistical Claims About The 2020 Election\" written by Justin Grimmer, Haritz Garro and Andrew C Eggers, was published by the conservative Hoover Institution (February 3, 2021) concluded that the statistics used to \"claim some election facts would be unlikely if there had been no fraud\" were either not accurate in the first place or if they were accurate, weren't really surprising [570]\n\n\nReactions\nDr Eastman and President Trump launched a campaign to overturn a democratic election, an action unprecedented in American history Their

Our guiding light is Profit, acquired in a strictly legal way Our Lord is His Majesty, Money, for it is only He who can lead us to wealth as the norm in life.\" [20]\n\n\nYukos acquisition\nIn 1992, Khodorkovsky was appointed chairman of the Investment Promotion Fund of the fuel and power industry He was appointed Deputy Minister of Fuel and Energy of Russia in March 1993 In 1996, Menatep acquired a major Russian oil producer, Yukos, which had debts exceeding $3.5 billion, for $309 million [26] [27] [28]\n\n\nEuropean Union Bank in Antigua\nFor one week in 1994, he was the director of an online internet bank known as the European Union Bank based in Antigua after which it collapsed [24] Numerous banking regulators claimed it was a scam [24]\n\n\nBank failure\nBy 1998, Khodorkovsky had built an import-export business with an annual turnover of 80 million rubles (about US$10 million) In the 1998 Russian crash, however, his bank went under and Yukos had serious problems owing to a drop in the price of oil Realizing that \"business could no longer be just a game\" and that \"capitalism could make people not only rich and happy but also poor and powerless\", he \"swore off his absolute faith in wealth just as he had sworn off his absolute faith in Communism.\" [20]\n\n\nEarly philanthropic activities\nAfter the price of oil began to rise again, he established the Open Russia Foundation, in 2001 It was based at Somerset House in London with Henry Kissinger as one of its trustees [citation needed] The Foundation's mission statement declared: \"The motivation for the establishment of the Open Russia Foundation is the wish to foster enhanced openness, understanding and integration between the people of Russia and the rest of the world.\" The following year it had its United States launch in Washington, D.C [29]\n\n\nMerger with Sibneft\nIn April 2003, Khodorkovsky announced that Yukos would merge with Sibneft, creating an oil company with reserves equal to those of Western petroleum multinationals Khodorkovsky had been reported to be involved in negotiations with ExxonMobil and ChevronTexaco to sell one or the other of them a large stake in Yukos Sibneft was created in 1995, at the suggestion of Boris Berezovsky, comprising some of the most valuable assets of a state-owned oil company In a controversial auction process, Berezovsky acquired 50% of the company at what most agree was a very low price [33]\n\n\n2003: Richest man in Russia\nKhodorkovsky hired McKinsey & Company to reform Yukos's management structure, and Pricewaterhouse to establish an accounting system Thanks partly to the rising oil prices, partly to modernized operations, and partly to its \"new transparency\", Yukos thrived \"By 2003, Khodorkovsky was the richest man in Russia, and potentially on his way to becoming the richest man in the world In 2004, Forbes placed him 16th on its list of the world's wealthiest people, with a fortune estimated at $16 billion.\" [20]\n\n\nCriminal charges and incarceration\nIn early July 2003, Platon Lebedev, Khodorkovsky's partner and the fourth largest shareholder in Yukos, was arrested on suspicion of illegally acquiring a stake in the state-owned fertilizer firm Apatit in 1994 The arrest was followed by purported investigations into taxation returns filed by Yukos, and a delay in the antitrust commission's approval of its merger with Sibneft [34] [35]\n\n\n2003 arrest\nIn early July 2003, Platon Lebedev, Khodorkovsky's partner and the fourth largest shareholder in Yukos, was arrested on suspicion of illegally acquiring a stake in the state-owned fertilizer firm Apatit in 1994 The arrest was followed by purported investigations into taxation returns filed by Yukos, and a delay in the antitrust commission's approval of its merger with Sibneft [34] [35]\n\n\nReactions in Russia and abroad\nInitially news of Khodorkovsky's arrest had a significant effect on the share price of Yukos The Moscow stock market was closed for the first time ever for an hour to ensure stable trading as prices collapsed Russia's currency, the ruble, was also hit as some foreign investors questioned the stability of the Russian market Media reaction in Moscow was almost universally negative in blanket coverage, some of the more enthusiastic pro-business press discussed the end of capitalism, while even the government-owned press criticised the \"absurd\" method of Khodorkovsky's arrest.\n\n\nThe first trial, 2004–2005\nThe charges against Khodorkovsky and his associates were that, in 1994, while chairman of Menatep, he \"created an organized group of individuals with the intention of taking control of the shares in Russian companies during the privatisation process through deceit.\" This was with particular reference to supposedly \"illegal actions\" he had taken in the privatisation of the State-owned mining and fertiliser company Apatit.\n\n\nIndependent support\nKhodorkovsky received support from independent third parties who believed that he was a victim of a politicized judicial system [46] On 29 November 2004, the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights published a report, which concluded, \"the circumstances of the arrest and prosecution of leading Yukos executives suggest that the interest of the State's action in these cases goes beyond the mere pursuit of criminal justice, to include such elements as to weaken an outspoken political opponent, to intimidate other wealthy individuals and to regain control of strategic economic assets.\" [47]\n\n\nIn prison\nOn 30 May 2005, Mikhail Khodorkovsky was sentenced to nine years in a medium security prison At the time, he was detained at Matrosskaya Tishina, a prison in Moscow On 1 August 2005, a political essay written by Khodorkovsky in his prison cell, titled \"Left Turn\", was published in Vedomosti, calling for a turn to a more socially responsible state He stated:\n\n\nPolitical transformation\nThe Economist asserted in April 2010 that after six years in prison, Khodorkovsky had politically transformed from an oligarch into a political prisoner and freedom fighter: \"He speaks with the authority of a chief executive of what was once Russia's largest oil company He explains how Yukos and Russia's oil industry functioned, but he goes beyond business matters What he is defending is not his long-lost business, but his human rights The transformation of Mr Khodorkovsky from a ruthless oligarch, operating in a virtually lawless climate, into a political prisoner and freedom fighter is one of the more intriguing tales in post-communist Russia.\" [71]\n\n\nSecond trial, 2009–2010\nKhodorkovsky became eligible for parole after having served half of his original sentence, however, in February 2007, state prosecutors began to prepare new charges of embezzlement, leading up to a second trial which began in March 2009.\n\n\nCharges\nKhodorkovsky became eligible for parole after having served half of his original sentence, however, in February 2007, state prosecutors began to prepare new charges of embezzlement, leading up to a second trial which began in March 2009.\n\n\nJudicial controversy\nOn 14 February 2011, Natalya Vasilyeva, an assistant to Judge Viktor Danilkin, said that the judge did not write the verdict, and had read it against his will [83] Essentially, Natalya Vasilyeva said the judge's verdict was \"brought from the Moscow City Court\" [84]\n\n\nAppeal and Amnesty International statement\nOn 24 May 2011, Khodorkovsky's appeal hearing was held, and Judge Danilkin rejected the challenge [87] Following the rejection of the appeal, the human rights group Amnesty International declared Khodorkovsky and Lebedev as \"prisoners of conscience\", remarking in a statement that \"Whatever the rights and wrongs of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev's first convictions there can no longer be any doubt that their second trial was deeply flawed and politically motivated.\" [6] On 25 October 2013, the Berlin International Literature Festival held a worldwide reading in solidarity with Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Platon Lebedev and all political prisoners in Russia [88]\n\n\nRelease\nAccording to his official site, Khodorkovsky would have been eligible for early release, but an alleged conspiracy involving jail guards and a cellmate resulted in a statement that he had violated one of the prison rules This was sufficient for him to forfeit his rights, once the statement was logged in his file [90]\n\n\nUpon release from prison (2013)\nOn 19 December 2013, president Vladimir Putin said he intended to pardon Khodorkovsky in the near future [100] He did so on the following day, [101] stating that Khodorkovsky's mother was ill and Khodorkovsky had asked for clemency Putin also felt that ten years in jail was still \"a significant punishment\" Some opposition leaders suggested that the upcoming 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi might have played a role in the granting of the pardon [102] His guards told him to pack his things and he was flown at once to St Petersburg, where he was given \"a parka and a passport\" and, switching planes on the tarmac, put on a flight to Berlin [103] [104] [105] [13] The Guardian reported in December 2014 that Khodorkovsky had \"promised Putin three things in a handwritten letter\" in which he asked to be freed: \"that he would leave Russia to spend time with his family, would stay away from politics, and would not attempt to win back his shares in Yukos .. or get involved in any court cases.\" However Khodorkovsky maintains that he had made no such promise [105]\n\n\nLife in exile (2013–)\nFollowing his pardon and release from prison on 20 December 2013 at the same time as members of the protest group Pussy Riot, [118] Khodorkovsky made only a few public appearances until the revolution broke out in Ukraine On 9 March 2014, Khodorkovsky spoke at Maidan Nezalezhnosti in Kyiv, where he accused the Russian government of complicity in the killing of protesters [119] [120]\n\n\nPolitics\n\nKhodorkovsky is openly critical of what he refers to as \"managed democracy\" within Russia Careful normally not to criticise the current leadership, he says the military and security services exercise too much authority In 2010 he told The Times:\n\nRelationship with Vladimir Putin\n\"At the root of the conflict between Putin and Khodorkovsky\", stated writer and activist Masha Gessen in April 2012, \"lies a basic difference in character Putin rarely says what he means and even less frequently trusts that others are saying what they mean Khodorkovsky, in contrast, seems to have always taken himself and others at face value—he has constructed his identity in accordance with his convictions and his life in accordance with his identity That is what landed him in prison and what has kept him there.\" [20]\n\n\nPublications\nKhodorkhovsky has been involved in various philanthropic endeavours since the beginning of the 21st

acquired a major Russian oil producer, Yukos, which had debts exceeding $3.5 billion, for $309 million [26] [27] [28]\n\n\nEuropean Union Bank in Antigua\nFor one week in 1994, he was the director of an online internet bank known as the European Union Bank based in Antigua after which it collapsed [24] Numerous banking regulators claimed it was a scam [24]\n\n\nBank failure\nBy 1998, Khodorkovsky had built an import-export business with an annual turnover of 80 million rubles (about US$10 million) In the 1998 Russian crash, however, his bank went under and Yukos had serious problems owing to a drop in the price of oil Realizing that \"business could no longer be just a game\" and that \"capitalism could make people not only rich and happy but also poor and powerless\", he \"swore off his absolute faith in wealth just as he had sworn off his absolute faith in Communism.\" [20]\n\n\nEarly philanthropic activities\nAfter the price of oil began to rise again, he established the Open Russia Foundation, in 2001 It was based at Somerset House in London with Henry Kissinger as one of its trustees [citation needed] The Foundation's mission statement declared: \"The motivation for the establishment of the Open Russia Foundation is the wish to foster enhanced openness, understanding and integration between the people of Russia and the rest of the world.\" The following year it had its United States launch in Washington, D.C [29]\n\n\nMerger with Sibneft\nIn April 2003, Khodorkovsky announced that Yukos would merge with Sibneft, creating an oil company with reserves equal to those of Western petroleum multinationals Khodorkovsky had been reported to be involved in negotiations with ExxonMobil and ChevronTexaco to sell one or the other of them a large stake in Yukos Sibneft was created in 1995, at the suggestion of Boris Berezovsky, comprising some of the most valuable assets of a state-owned oil company In a controversial auction process, Berezovsky acquired 50% of the company at what most agree was a very low price [33]\n\n\n2003: Richest man in Russia\nKhodorkovsky hired McKinsey & Company to reform Yukos's management structure, and Pricewaterhouse to establish an accounting system Thanks partly to the rising oil prices, partly to modernized operations, and partly to its \"new transparency\", Yukos thrived \"By 2003, Khodorkovsky was the richest man in Russia, and potentially on his way to becoming the richest man in the world In 2004, Forbes placed him 16th on its list of the world's wealthiest people, with a fortune estimated at $16 billion.\" [20]\n\n\nCriminal charges and incarceration\nIn early July 2003, Platon Lebedev, Khodorkovsky's partner and the fourth largest shareholder in Yukos, was arrested on suspicion of illegally acquiring a stake in the state-owned fertilizer firm Apatit in 1994 The arrest was followed by purported investigations into taxation returns filed by Yukos, and a delay in the antitrust commission's approval of its merger with Sibneft [34] [35]\n\n\n2003 arrest\nIn early July 2003, Platon Lebedev, Khodorkovsky's partner and the fourth largest shareholder in Yukos, was arrested on suspicion of illegally acquiring a stake in the state-owned fertilizer firm Apatit in 1994 The arrest was followed by purported investigations into taxation returns filed by Yukos, and a delay in the antitrust commission's approval of its merger with Sibneft [34] [35]\n\n\nReactions in Russia and abroad\nInitially news of Khodorkovsky's arrest had a significant effect on the share price of Yukos The Moscow stock market was closed for the first time ever for an hour to ensure stable trading as prices collapsed Russia's currency, the ruble, was also hit as some foreign investors questioned the stability of the Russian market Media reaction in Moscow was almost universally negative in blanket coverage, some of the more enthusiastic pro-business press discussed the end of capitalism, while even the government-owned press criticised the \"absurd\" method of Khodorkovsky's arrest.\n\n\nThe first trial, 2004–2005\nThe charges against Khodorkovsky and his associates were that, in 1994, while chairman of Menatep, he \"created an organized group of individuals with the intention of taking control of the shares in Russian companies during the privatisation process through deceit.\" This was with particular reference to supposedly \"illegal actions\" he had taken in the privatisation of the State-owned mining and fertiliser company Apatit.\n\n\nIndependent support\nKhodorkovsky received support from independent third parties who believed that he was a victim of a politicized judicial system [46] On 29 November 2004, the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights published a report, which concluded, \"the circumstances of the arrest and prosecution of leading Yukos executives suggest that the interest of the State's action in these cases goes beyond the mere pursuit of criminal justice, to include such elements as to weaken an outspoken political opponent, to intimidate other wealthy individuals and to regain control of strategic economic assets.\" [47]\n\n\nIn prison\nOn 30 May 2005, Mikhail Khodorkovsky was sentenced to nine years in a medium security prison At the time, he was detained at Matrosskaya Tishina, a prison in Moscow On 1 August 2005, a political essay written by Khodorkovsky in his prison cell, titled \"Left Turn\", was published in Vedomosti, calling for a turn to a more socially responsible state He stated:\n\n\nPolitical transformation\nThe Economist asserted in April 2010 that after six years in prison, Khodorkovsky had politically transformed from an oligarch into a political prisoner and freedom fighter: \"He speaks with the authority of a chief executive of what was once Russia's largest oil company He explains how Yukos and Russia's oil industry functioned, but he goes beyond business matters What he is defending is not his long-lost business, but his human rights The transformation of Mr Khodorkovsky from a ruthless oligarch, operating in a virtually lawless climate, into a political prisoner and freedom fighter is one of the more intriguing tales in post-communist Russia.\" [71]\n\n\nSecond trial, 2009–2010\nKhodorkovsky became eligible for parole after having served half of his original sentence, however, in February 2007, state prosecutors began to prepare new charges of embezzlement, leading up to a second trial which began in March 2009.\n\n\nCharges\nKhodorkovsky became eligible for parole after having served half of his original sentence, however, in February 2007, state prosecutors began to prepare new charges of embezzlement, leading up to a second trial which began in March 2009.\n\n\nJudicial controversy\nOn 14 February 2011, Natalya Vasilyeva, an assistant to Judge Viktor Danilkin, said that the judge did not write the verdict, and had read it against his will [83] Essentially, Natalya Vasilyeva said the judge's verdict was \"brought from the Moscow City Court\" [84]\n\n\nAppeal and Amnesty International statement\nOn 24 May 2011, Khodorkovsky's appeal hearing was held, and Judge Danilkin rejected the challenge [87] Following the rejection of the appeal, the human rights group Amnesty International declared Khodorkovsky and Lebedev as \"prisoners of conscience\", remarking in a statement that \"Whatever the rights and wrongs of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev's first convictions there can no longer be any doubt that their second trial was deeply flawed and politically motivated.\" [6] On 25 October 2013, the Berlin International Literature Festival held a worldwide reading in solidarity with Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Platon Lebedev and all political prisoners in Russia [88]\n\n\nRelease\nAccording to his official site, Khodorkovsky would have been eligible for early release, but an alleged conspiracy involving jail guards and a cellmate resulted in a statement that he had violated one of the prison rules This was sufficient for him to forfeit his rights, once the statement was logged in his file [90]\n\n\nUpon release from prison (2013)\nOn 19 December 2013, president Vladimir Putin said he intended to pardon Khodorkovsky in the near future [100] He did so on the following day, [101] stating that Khodorkovsky's mother was ill and Khodorkovsky had asked for clemency Putin also felt that ten years in jail was still \"a significant punishment\" Some opposition leaders suggested that the upcoming 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi might have played a role in the granting of the pardon [102] His guards told him to pack his things and he was flown at once to St Petersburg, where he was given \"a parka and a passport\" and, switching planes on the tarmac, put on a flight to Berlin [103] [104] [105] [13] The Guardian reported in December 2014 that Khodorkovsky had \"promised Putin three things in a handwritten letter\" in which he asked to be freed: \"that he would leave Russia to spend time with his family, would stay away from politics, and would not attempt to win back his shares in Yukos .. or get involved in any court cases.\" However Khodorkovsky maintains that he had made no such promise [105]\n\n\nLife in exile (2013–)\nFollowing his pardon and release from prison on 20 December 2013 at the same time as members of the protest group Pussy Riot, [118] Khodorkovsky made only a few public appearances until the revolution broke out in Ukraine On 9 March 2014, Khodorkovsky spoke at Maidan Nezalezhnosti in Kyiv, where he accused the Russian government of complicity in the killing of protesters [119] [120]\n\n\nPolitics\n\nKhodorkovsky is openly critical of what he refers to as \"managed democracy\" within Russia Careful normally not to criticise the current leadership, he says the military and security services exercise too much authority In 2010 he told The Times:\n\nRelationship with Vladimir Putin\n\"At the root of the conflict between Putin and Khodorkovsky\", stated writer and activist Masha Gessen in April 2012, \"lies a basic difference in character Putin rarely says what he means and even less frequently trusts that others are saying what they mean Khodorkovsky, in contrast, seems to have always taken himself and others at face value—he has constructed his identity in accordance with his convictions and his life in accordance with his identity That is what landed him in prison and what has kept him there.\" [20]\n\n\nPublications\nKhodorkhovsky has been involved in various philanthropic endeavours since the beginning of the 21st

The film stars Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, Daniel Zovatto, and Stephen Lang.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nDon't Breathe is a tense and suspenseful home invasion thriller that follows three young friends who break into a blind man's house, only to find themselves trapped and fighting for survival. The film is a departure from Álvarez's previous work, Evil Dead, which was criticized for its excessive gore and reliance on shock value. Don't Breathe, on the other hand, focuses on building tension and creating a sense of unease through its clever plot twists and well-crafted characters.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film follows Rocky (Jane Levy), a young woman with a troubled past, and her two friends, Money (Daniel Zovatto) and Alex (Dylan Minnette). The trio makes a living by breaking into houses and stealing valuables in Detroit. However, their fence, who buys their stolen goods, consistently undervalues the items, leaving them with little to no profit. Rocky's younger sister, Diddy, is also a victim of their mother's abuse, and Rocky dreams of moving to California with her sister and escaping their troubled lives.\n\nOne night, the trio breaks into the house of a blind man, Norman (Stephen Lang), in search of a large sum of money. However, they soon realize that Norman is not what he seems, and they find themselves trapped in his house with no way out. As the night unfolds, the group must use their wits and resourcefulness to survive and escape the clutches of the blind man.\n\n**Cast and Characters**\n\nJane Levy plays the role of Rocky, a young woman with a troubled past and a desire to escape her difficult life. Dylan Minnette plays the role of Alex, Rocky's friend and partner in crime. Daniel Zovatto plays the role of Money, the group's loose cannon and self-proclaimed \"mastermind.\" Stephen Lang plays the role of Norman, the blind man who is not what he seems.\n\n**Production**\n\nFede Álvarez directed and co-wrote the film, which was produced by Sam Raimi and Zane Weiner. The film was shot on location in Hungary, with only a few scenes filmed in Detroit. Álvarez has stated that the film's low budget was a deliberate choice, allowing him to maintain creative control and avoid studio interference.\n\n**Casting**\n\nThe film features a talented cast, including Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, Daniel Zovatto, and Stephen Lang. Álvarez has stated that he was drawn to the cast's chemistry and ability to bring depth and nuance to their characters.\n\n**Filming**\n\nPrincipal photography for the film began in June 2015 and wrapped in August of the same year. Álvarez has stated that the film's shoot was relatively quick and efficient, allowing him to focus on the film's creative aspects.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe film premiered at South by Southwest in March 2016 and was theatrically released on August 26, 2016. The film received widespread critical acclaim and was a commercial success, grossing over $157 million worldwide.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe film received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising its tense and suspenseful plot, well-crafted characters, and effective use of tension and unease. The film holds a 88% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many critics praising its clever plot twists and well-crafted characters.\n\n**Critical Response**\n\nMany critics praised the film's tense and suspenseful plot, which was seen as a departure from Álvarez's previous work. The film's use of tension and unease was also praised, with many critics noting that the film's slow-burning tension was effectively used to create a sense of unease in the audience.\n\n**Box Office**\n\nThe film was a commercial success, grossing over $157 million worldwide. The film's low budget of $9.9 million made it a surprise hit, with many praising its effective use of resources and creative budgeting.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nThe film received several awards and nominations, including a nomination for the 88th Academy Awards for Best Sound Editing. The film's cast and crew also received several awards and nominations, including a nomination for the 2017 Saturn Awards for Best Horror Film.\n\n**Sequel**\n\nIn November 2016, Álvarez announced that a sequel to the film was in the works.

Friends\" (2016) [5] In an interview with Big Boy on March 15, 2024, Ty Dolla Sign expressed his loyalty to West, acknowledging both his successes and declines, and stated that he always knew West would regain popularity with each comeback and would celebrate his achievements when he did [6]\n\n\nMusic and themes\nVultures 1 is a hip hop album that encompasses house, R&B, and trap, [25] incorporating elements of gospel and industrial music [26] [27] [28] The album was described as more cohesive than West's recent records; [25] [28] [29] none of the tracks are mumbled [27] Steven J Horowitz of Variety summarized the musicality as a collection \"of sharp aural moments that twists and shifts at each turn\", observing that the different producers provide variety and scope [30] Pitchfork's Paul A Thompson described the beats as \"rhythmically complex\", with a lack of any heavy influences [27] According to The Guardian journalist Alexis Petridis, Vultures 1 features a variety of styles, although he thought it is still uneven [31] In AllMusic, Fred Thomas noted West demonstrates the \"same electric inventiveness\" that made him famous as a producer, attributing this

\"Roxanne\" [25] [37] According to Billboard's Michael Saponara, West \"utilizes his baby voice\" that evokes his 2022 appearance with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on InfoWars [37] The next track,

Italy, alongside other artists A joint concert at RCF Arena in Reggio Emilia, Italy was reportedly planned for October 20, 2023, but was delayed by a week and then canceled [3] [4] The performers had collaborated in the past on multiple occasions, such as West's tracks \"Only One\" (2014) and \"Real Friends\" (2016) [5] In an interview with Big Boy on March 15, 2024, Ty Dolla Sign expressed his loyalty to West, acknowledging both his successes and declines, and stated that he always knew West would regain popularity with each comeback and would celebrate his achievements when he did [6]\n\n\nMusic and themes\nVultures 1 is a hip hop album that encompasses house, R&B, and trap, [25] incorporating elements of gospel and industrial music [26] [27] [28] The album was described as more cohesive than West's recent records; [25] [28] [29] none of the tracks are mumbled [27] Steven J Horowitz of Variety summarized the musicality as a collection \"of sharp aural moments that twists and shifts at each turn\", observing that the different producers provide variety and scope [30] Pitchfork's Paul A Thompson described the beats as \"rhythmically complex\", with a lack of any heavy influences [27] According to The Guardian journalist Alexis Petridis, Vultures 1 features a variety of styles, although he thought it is still uneven [31] In AllMusic, Fred Thomas noted West demonstrates the \"same electric inventiveness\" that made him famous as a producer, attributing this to aspects of the tracks like sparseness, funk, and orchestral music [32] The New York Times journalist Jon Caramanica opined that the album reminds him of \"the texture-focused darkwave rap\" style utilized by rappers Playboi Carti and Travis Scott, which originated with West's 2013 record Yeezus [33]\n\n\nSongs\nVultures 1 opens with the slow-building gospel track \"Stars\", where West's vocal pitch rises and falls [27] [36] Lyrically, him and Ty Dolla Sign embrace their

Censori, mentioning how he aims to have another child [37] \"Paid\" incorporates elements of funk, electronic, and dubstep, relying on an upbeat drum pattern [28] [32] [36] The song is themed around capitalism and includes dance-pop style crooning from Ty Dolla Sign, while West delivers an interpolation of the Police's \"Roxanne\" [25] [37] According to Billboard's Michael Saponara, West \"utilizes his baby voice\" that evokes his 2022 appearance with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on InfoWars [37] The next track, \"Talking\", continues the drum pattern and features West's daughter North West proclaiming on the chorus she is \"your bestie\", asserting that she should not be tested [36] [37] [40] Ty Dolla Sign delivers a verse about his daughter growing up and expresses hope she

{"title": "Tropical_cyclones_in_2021", "content": "\nGlobal atmospheric and hydrological conditions\nThe La Niña from the previous year persisted into 2021, [3] though by March and April it had begun to weaken [4] [5] On May 13, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) assessed that the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) transitioned into its neutral phase [6] However, following cooler than normal temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean, NOAA declared that the global weather conditions shifted back to La Niña by October [7]\n\n\nSummary\nThe 2021 Atlantic hurricane season officially ran from June 1 to November 30 A total of 21 tropical depressions formed, all of which reached at least tropical or subtropical intensity The season ranks as the third-most active of all time in the Atlantic basin, behind only 2005 and 2020 Consequently, the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season was the third on record to exhaust its naming list Nine of the systems lasted for two days or less, tied with 2007 for the most since the NHC began monitoring subtropical systems in 1968 Although the season was highly active in terms of the number of named storms, seven of those tropical or subtropical systems intensified into a hurricane and four of those became a major hurricane, which is near-average and just slightly above-average, respectively Nonetheless, 2021 marked the record sixth consecutive above-average season in the Atlantic [10] The ongoing warm Atlantic multidecadal oscillation, which began in 1995, contributed to the season's high level of activity, as it led to above-average sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic basin Other factors included the presence of a La Niña and abnormally heavy West African Monsoon precipitation [11]\n\n\nNorth Atlantic Ocean\nThe 2021 Atlantic hurricane season officially ran from June 1 to November 30 A total of 21 tropical depressions formed, all of which reached at least tropical or subtropical intensity The

precipitation [11]\n\n\nEastern & Central Pacific Oceans\nThe 2021 Pacific hurricane season began on May 15 in the East Pacific and on June 1 in the Central Pacific [23] Overall activity included 19 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes The total of named storms was above the 1991–2020 average, while the number of hurricanes was average, and the sum of major hurricanes was below average [24] The official start date was preceded by the formation of Tropical Storm Andres, the earliest named storm on record in the East Pacific [25] It was accompanied by Tropical Storm Blanca later in May [26] The following month included the formations of tropical storms Carlos and Dolores, in addition to Hurricane Enrique While Carlos remained away from land, Dolores made landfall on the Mexico coastline and Enrique delivered impacts across southwestern sections of the country while it passed just offshore [27] Above-average seasonal activity continued into July with the development of hurricanes Felicia and Hilda, Tropical Storm Guillermo, and Tropical Depression Nine-E; none of these cyclones impacted land [28] In August, Hurricane Nora made landfall along the west-central coastline of Mexico Its formation was preceded by Hurricane Linda and tropical storms Ignacio, Kevin, and Marty, which did not impact land [29] September marked a stark turn around to the activity of the previous months, as it only featured Olaf, which struck San José del Cabo as a Category 2 hurricane [30] Two hurricanes – Pamela and Rick – moved ashore the Mexico coastline in October [31] An additional two storms, Terry and Sandra, developed in November, the fourth consecutive November with at least one named storm Furthermore, those cyclones existed simultaneously, the first occurrence in the East Pacific during November on record The Accumulated Cyclone Energy index for the 2021 Pacific hurricane season as calculated by Colorado State University using data from the National Hurricane Center was approximately 94 units, [nb 2] [32] about 30 percent below average.\n\n\nWestern Pacific Ocean\nOn January 19, a tropical depression formed, becoming the first Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclone of the year and of the 2021 Pacific typhoon season It brought minor damage to the Philippines On February 16, another system formed, with the PAGASA giving it the name Auring and the JTWC designating the system as 01W On February 17, it was named Dujuan by the JMA After passing over Palau, it brought minor damage to the Philippines before dissipating on February 22 On March 14, a tropical depression formed near the Sulu Sea, though it was short-lived and it quickly degenerated back into a low-pressure area On April 12, a tropical depression formed south of Woleai, and on the next day, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm, giving it the name Surigae On April 16, it was given the name Bising by the PAGASA as it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility Surigae underwent rapid intensification, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone to form before May in the Northern Hemisphere After bringing severe damages to the Philippines, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on April 24 and dissipated on April 30 On May 12, the JTWC began tracking a tropical depression, giving it the designation 03W with the PAGASA assigning it the local name Crising It made landfall on the Philippines as a weak tropical storm, however damage was minimal due to the storm's small size Two tropical depressions formed near Palau on May 29 and May 30 respectively, with the former being assigned the name Choi-wan by the JMA Choi-wan moved through the Philippines before merging with the Meiyu front on June 4 After a week gap on June 11, another tropical depression formed over the South China Sea and it intensified further to a tropical storm named as Koguma However, it remained short-lived and made landfall over the nation of Vietnam by the next day and soon dissipated thereafter After 10 days on June 21, Tropical Storm Champi formed As a tropical depression, it affected the Mariana Islands and Guam before intensifying into a weak typhoon It became extratropical on 27 June A tropical depression with its Filipino name, Emong, formed a couple hundred miles from Mainland China The storm remained a tropical depression and later dissipated Another tropical depression formed near Vietnam a couple days later, the storm later made landfall in the country as a weak tropical depression A tropical depression formed later in the month having the Filipino name Fabian, later intensifying to  a tropical storm with the JMA giving it the name In-fa In-fa later intensified to a typhoon, made several landfalls in China and dissipated on July 31 Meanwhile, Cempaka formed in the South China Sea and made landfall on Southern China and Vietnam causing moderate damage Later, Tropical Storm Nepartak struck Miyagi Prefecture in Japan The system had disturbed the ongoing Summer Olympics held in Japan Nepartak was also the first tropical storm to hit Miyagi since records began in 1951 By the end of July, activities exploded as 8 systems formed within a week however, 5 of them were rather weak and dissipated without becoming tropical storms The remaining 3 were named Lupit, Nida, and Mirinae Lupit affected most of East Asia while Nida and Mirinae approached Japan but stayed away from land Later, a tropical wave from the Central Pacific traveled a long distance and became a tropical storm over the Philippine Sea, which was named Omais (Isang) Omais caused minor damage to The Ryukyu Islands and South Korea After Omais, the rest of August remained quiet when Conson formed off the coast of the Philippines and became a typhoon in less than 24 hours Conson struck the Philippines and Vietnam causing severe damage Then, Chanthu formed and became the second super typhoon of the season Chanthu then headed over to the East China Sea where the system weakened and stalled It later made landfall over Kyushu, Japan and dissipated south of the country On September 21, two new systems formed and was named Dianmu and Mindulle Dianmu headed over to Vietnam where it made landfall Meanwhile, following Chanthu, Mindulle rapidly intensified into the season's third super typhoon Mindulle weakened and strengthened multiple times due to cool dry air and cool sea-surface temperatures Mindulle eventually passed through Japan's Izu Islands causing minor damage On the start of October, Tropical storm Lionrock formed east of the Philippines and made landfall on the Chinese Island of Hainan Soon, two tropical depressions named Maring and Nando formed However, the two storms eventually merged into Tropical Storm Kompasu due to the storms being close to each other Kompasu then intensified near typhoon strength and affected the same area where Lionrock had struck The storm caused severe damage Later, another tropical depression formed near Wake Island, which was eventually named Namtheun Namtheun however, stayed away from any landmass and became an extratropical cyclone On October 23, a tropical depression formed near Guam which then was named Malou Malou reached its peak as a Category 2 typhoon but it did not effect any land A day after Malou formed, another tropical depression formed near the Philippines and the JTWC designating the system as 26W The storm then made landfall over Vietnam and dissipated In November, Typhon Nyatoh being the only storm of the month formed southeast of Guam and unexpectedly rapidly intensified to a Category 4 super typhoon due to jet interaction However, it was short lived and the JMA declared the storm became a remnant low On December,  Typhoon Rai formed very late during the season and struck Palau and caused severe destruction in the Philippines Rai also became a Category 5 super typhoon twice near the Philippines and in the South China Sea Rai became the first Category 5 super typhoon since Nock-ten to form in the month on December It was also only the third Category 5 super typhoon recorded in the South China Sea, along with Pamela in 1954 and Rammasun in 2014 Additionally, a tropical depression classified as 29W formed near the equator in the South China Sea The depression then made landfall on Malaysia, flooding some states within the country.\n\n\nNorth Indian Ocean\nOn April 2, a tropical depression formed in the north Andaman Sea near the Myanmar coast It remained short-lived, however, dissipating the next day It was the fourth system to form within the first fifteen days of April since the satellite era began in 1960 Formation during this time is considered rare since the first storm of a season usually forms in mid-April or May A month later, on May 14, another tropical depression formed in the Arabian Sea Later that day, it intensified into a cyclonic storm, being assigned the name Tauktae by the IMD It intensified to an extremely severe cyclonic storm and made landfall on Gujarat Ten days later another tropical depression formed in the Bay of Bengal in May 23, before strengthening into a cyclonic storm and receiving the name Yaas It rapidly intensified further to a very severe cyclonic storm and made landfall in Odisha Both of these storms caused considerable loss of lives and damage On September 12, after a long period of inactivity, BOB 03 formed BOB 03 intensified to a deep depression, before making landfall in India It dissipated on September 15 On September 24, a tropical depression formed in the Bay of Bengal It was designated BOB 04 by the IMD In the next two days, it intensified into a cyclonic storm and was named Gulab It made landfall in India Later, the remnants of Gulab later re-intensified into Shaheen in the Arabian Sea Shaheen entered the Gulf of Oman, where it became a Severe Cyclonic Storm However, it struggled to intensify any further, due to lack of convection Shaheen eventually made landfall near Al Suwaiq in the governorate of Al Batinah North in Oman Shaheen became the first cyclone to hit the country since Cyclone Hikaa in 2019 It was also the first cyclone to enter the Gulf of Oman since Cyclone Gonu in 2007 On November 7, ARB 03 formed It stayed out to sea and dissipated two days later On November 10, a tropical depression formed It was designated BOB 05 by the IMD It was short lived, dissipating two days later However, this depression caused severe flooding in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.\n\n\nSouth-West Indian Ocean\nFrom the 2020 season, two systems crossed into the 2021 season after having formed during the previous year The systems were Danilo, which peaked as a high-end severe tropical storm and briefly passed near the Mascarene Islands, and a tropical depression designated as 05 which entered the South-West Indian Ocean basin on December 28, causing a Fujiwhara effect with Danilo before dissipating on January 3 In the 2021 season, a tropical disturbance formed in the South-West Indian Ocean, which intensified into a tropical storm, being given the name Eloise After making landfall on Madagascar, it rapidly intensified into a tropical cyclone in the Mozambique Channel before making a second landfall on Beira Its remnants affected Zimbabwe, Eswatini, and South Africa Joshua entered the basin from the Australian Region on the same day On January 27, 10U from the Australian region entered the basin and was designated as Tropical Depression 09 before quickly dissipating thereafter.\n\n\nJanuary - June\nIn January 2021, four tropical disturbances formed in the South Pacific, all four of which intensified into tropical depressions, with Ana and Bina intensifying into tropical cyclones On February 1, Lucas entered from the Australian region and affected New Caledonia and Vanuatu A tropical depression designated as 09F formed on February 7, before it was upgraded into a tropical storm by the JTWC However, it accelerated southwards and became extratropical on February 11 Another tropical depression designated as 10F formed on February 22, before dissipating on February 24 Niran entered the basin on March 5 and caused extensive damage in New Caledonia before accelerating southeast as it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone On March 5, a short-lived tropical depression designated as 11F existed from March 5 to March 6 On April 9, a tropical depression designated as 13F entered the basin, however, it dissipated on April 11 without intensifying into a tropical cyclone.\n\n\nJuly - December\nOn December 13, the basin's first storm started off with Ruby, which entered the basin from the Australian basin as a Category 2 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale Ruby eventually made landfall over New Caledonia    \n\n\nAustralian region\nAt the beginning of the 2021 season, a new tropical low formed in the Australian region near the Northern Territory of Australia, which further intensified into the first named cyclone of 2021, being given the name Imogen before making landfall on Far North Queensland Another tropical low formed northeast of the Cocos Islands which lasted for five days and dissipated on January 10 Joshua formed on January 13 and crossed into the South-West Indian Ocean basin four days later A new tropical low formed on January 16 near Queensland, which intensified into a cyclone named Kimi on the next day Four additional tropical lows formed after Kimi, of which one managed to intensify into Cyclone Lucas before crossing into the South Pacific basin on February 3, while the other three had minor effects on land.\n\n\nJanuary - June\nIn January 2021, four tropical disturbances formed in the South Pacific, all four of which intensified into tropical depressions, with Ana and Bina intensifying into tropical cyclones On February 1, Lucas entered from the Australian region and affected New Caledonia and Vanuatu A tropical

over New Caledonia    \n\n\nSouth Atlantic Ocean\nOn February 6, a weak system unofficially designated as 01Q was briefly tracked by the NOAA The system formed and dissipated on the same day without being monitored by the Brazilian Navy Another system formed on February 14 near Rio Grande do Sul, being designated as a subtropical depression by the Brazilian Navy On April 19, a subtropical depression formed, although its precursor formed off the coast of Rio de Janeiro On April 20 the subtropical depression gained strength and was classified as a subtropical storm by the Brazilian Navy, being assigned the name Potira It brought gale-force winds to Copacabana.\nOn June 28, an extratropical cyclone in Uruguay transitioned into a subtropical depression on the evening of the same day, being given the designation Invest 1N by the NOAA  A day later, the storm strengthened into a subtropical storm On June 29, as the subtropical storm entered Brazilian maritime territory, the Brazilian Navy named it Raoni [33] On December 10, a subtropical cyclone evolved into a subtropical depression and on the morning of the same day it turned into a subtropical storm, called Ubá by the Brazilian Navy [34]\n\n\nSystems\nJanuary was unusually above-average, with fourteen tropical cyclones forming and seven being named Before that, two systems crossed into the 2021 season after having formed during the previous year Danilo was one of the systems that crossed over, peaking as a severe tropical storm and briefly passing near the Mascarene Islands A tropical depression designated as 05 entered the South-West Indian Ocean basin on December 28 and caused a brief interaction with Danilo before dissipating on January 3 In the Australian region, Cyclone Imogen formed on January 1 and affected Far North Queensland, bringing minimal damage to the area Following Imogen, Cyclone Joshua, Cyclone Kimi, and Cyclone Lucas developed, with Joshua later entering the South-West Indian Ocean on January 17 Kimi threatened to strike the coast of Queensland, but weakened suddenly due to unexpected wind shear, remaining just offshore instead Lucas formed on January 25 and entered the South Pacific basin on February 1 Additionally, four tropical lows formed in the basin, out of which one system entered the South-West Indian Ocean basin In the South-West Indian Ocean, Cyclone Eloise formed and first made landfall on Madagascar as a severe tropical storm It rapidly intensified over the Mozambique Channel and became the strongest storm of the month shortly before making a damaging landfall on Mozambique, with its remnants entering Zimbabwe, Eswatini, and South Africa In the South Pacific, two tropical depressions formed, which were later assigned the names Ana and Bina, both of them affected Fiji and Vanuatu In the West Pacific, a tropical depression formed, which became the first Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclone of 2021 and also marked the beginning of the 2021 Pacific typhoon season.\n\n\nJanuary\nJanuary was unusually above-average, with fourteen tropical cyclones forming and seven being named Before that, two systems crossed into the 2021 season after having

South-West Indian Ocean, Cyclone Faraji formed and rapidly intensified, being classified as a very intense tropical cyclone before becoming the strongest storm of the month as it strengthened into the first Category 5-equivalent tropical cyclone in the basin since Cyclone Ambali in 2019 It also became the first very intense tropical cyclone recorded in the month of February It then began to gradually weaken, dissipating on February 13 Another system formed on February 10 and made landfall on Mozambique before re-emerging back over water, and was given the name Guambe before reaching tropical cyclone status In the Western Pacific, Tropical Storm Dujuan formed and became the basin's first named storm, bringing minor damage to the Philippines In the South Atlantic, one system was unofficially monitored by NOAA, being given the unofficial designation of 01Q However, the Brazilian Navy did not monitor the system Another system formed near Rio Grande do Sul and was designated as a subtropical depression by the Brazilian Navy.\n\n\nMarch\nMarch was slightly below-average, featuring nine tropical cyclones with only two being named In the Australian region, five tropical lows formed on March 10, 18, 21, and 29 respectively In the South Pacific, a tropical depression formed and was designated as 11F, though it was short-lived, dissipating the next day In the South-West Indian Ocean, Habana formed and explosively intensified to an intense tropical cyclone, persisting for two weeks and reaching three individual peak intensities Forming along with Habana was Tropical Storm Iman, which made landfall on Madagascar as a tropical depression and bringing heavy rainfall to Réunion, dissipating a few days later In the West Pacific, a tropical depression formed on March 14, however it was short-lived, dissipating the same day \n\n\nApril\nApril was above-average, featuring nine systems, of which five were named In the Australian region, Cyclone Seroja formed near East Timor and Indonesia Its precursor caused catastrophic damage and deadly landslides in the West Nusa Tenggara and East Nusa Tenggara provinces of Indonesia and East Timor, causing 229 fatalities before strengthening to a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone and making a rare landfall on Midwestern Australia, becoming the first since Elaine in 1999 Odette also formed in the region near the Cocos Islands before undergoing a Fujiwhara interaction with Seroja quickly after its formation and later being absorbed by it Additionally, two tropical lows formed on April 7 and April 9, of which one entered the South Pacific basin In the North Indian Ocean, a short-lived tropical depression formed off the Myanmar coast in the north Andaman Sea, however it dissipated the next day In the Australian region, a tropical low formed before later moving into the South Pacific basin, being designated as 13F; it was short-lived and dissipated on April 11 In the South-West Indian Ocean, Cyclone Jobo developed near the Seychelles, undergoing a brief period of rapid intensification before dissipating near Tanzania on April 24 In the West Pacific, Typhoon Surigae formed south of Woleai and rapidly intensified into a Category 5-equivalent typhoon, becoming the strongest typhoon recorded in the month of April as it passed near the Philippines In the South Atlantic, Subtropical Storm Potira formed just off the coast of Rio de Janeiro, causing gale-force winds in Copacabana.\n\n\nMay\nMay was well above average, even though tropical cyclogenesis started in mid-May It featured the formation of nine systems, with six being named In the Australian region near the Cocos Islands, an off-season tropical low formed before dissipating on June 3 In the East Pacific, Tropical Storm Andres formed and

Pacific, a tropical depression formed on May 12 before making landfall on the Philippines and dissipating shortly thereafter Tropical Storm Choi-wan and a tropical depression also formed later in the month, with Choi-wan peaking as a tropical storm Choi-wan made several landfalls in the Philippines, causing severe damage It later weakened into a tropical depression before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone.\n\n\nJune\nJune was a slightly above average-month, featuring the formation of ten tropical cyclones with nine being named In the East Pacific, Tropical Storm Carlos, Tropical Storm Dolores and Hurricane Enrique formed, with Dolores making landfall near the border between Michoacán and Colima in Mexico near hurricane strength, killing 3 people, while Enrique intensified to a hurricane in a similar location to Dolores later in the month, becoming the strongest storm of the month In the North Atlantic, Tropical Storm Bill formed off the coast of North Carolina, Tropical Storm Claudette formed over southeastern Louisiana and brought heavy rain and severe weather to the Southeastern United States, while Tropical Storm Danny formed off the coast of South Carolina late in the month, tying the Atlantic for the most active June In the North Atlantic, Hurricane Elsa formed, becoming the earliest fifth-named storm on record and beating the record of Tropical Storm Edouard of the previous year, bringing substantial damage to the Caribbean and eastern North America In the West Pacific, Tropical Storm Koguma formed near Hong Kong and crossed Hainan before making

named In the East Pacific, Hurricane Felicia and Tropical Storm Guillermo formed in the middle half of the month, with Felicia becoming the first major hurricane of its respective Pacific hurricane season Hurricane Hilda would then form at the end of the month In the West Pacific, two tropical depressions formed and were designated as 07W and 08W respectively The former received the name Emong from PAGASA Further into the month, two typhoons named In-fa and Cempaka and Tropical Storm Nepartak formed, with In-fa making landfall in China as severe tropical storm while Cempaka made landfall in Southern China as a typhoon; both were associated with the 2021 Henan floods Nepartak, on the other hand, made landfall on the Miyagi Prefecture in Japan The storm disturbed the ongoing Summer Olympics held in the country.\n\n\nAugust\nAugust was fair-above average, featuring eighteen tropical cyclones, with sixteen of them being named In the East Pacific, Tropical Storm Ignacio formed, but dissipated a few days later due to strong wind shear partially due to its proximity to Hurricane Hilda Tropical Storm Kevin would then form a couple of days later, off the coast of Mexico with Hurricane Linda following shortly after, peaking as a low-end Category 4-equivalent hurricane Linda was to be followed by Tropical Storm Marty and Hurricane Nora In the West Pacific, tropical storms Lupit, Mirinae, Nida and Omais formed, with Lupit making landfall in China and Japan In the North Atlantic, Tropical Storm Fred formed south of Puerto Rico and made landfall in the Florida Panhandle, with Hurricanes  Grace and Henri forming later Grace impacted the Caribbean before making landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula before rapidly intensifying in the Bay of Campeche and making landfall as a

in 1991 At the end of the month, Hurricanes Ida and Larry, as well as tropical storms Julian and\nKate, and  formed Ida, which became the strongest storm of the month, brought impacts to Cuba before striking Louisiana on August 29, notably on the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, tying with Hurricane Laura of the previous year and the 1856 Last Island Hurricane as the strongest hurricane to make landfall in the state by maximum winds.\n\n\nSeptember\nSeptember was well–above average, featuring nineteen storms, with fifteen of them being named In the East Pacific, Hurricane Olaf being the only system in the basin, formed on the east coast of Mexico and later made landfall on the Baja California Peninsula as a Category 2 hurricane In the West Pacific, Tropical Storms Conson and Dianmu, Typhoons Chanthu and Mindulle as well as three short-lived depressions formed, with Chanthu becoming the strongest storm of the month Conson made a series of landfalls in the Philippines while Chanthu affected most of East Asia, due to the system stalling in the East China Sea Mindulle on the other hand caused minor damage on Japan's Izu Islands In the Atlantic, (Sub)Tropical Storms Mindy, Odette, Peter, Rose, Teresa, Victor as well as Hurricanes Nicholas and Sam formed Mindy made landfall on St Vincent Island in Florida, while Nicholas made landfall near Sargent in Texas Hurricane Sam was a slow moving Category 4 hurricane which traveled across the Atlantic for two weeks In the North Indian Ocean, Cyclonic Storm Gulab, Shaheen (a regeneration of Gulab), and BOB 03 formed Gulab made landfall in India, causing minor damage Soon, the remnants of Gulab regenerated into Shaheen in the Arabian Sea west of India Shaheen entered the Gulf of Oman and eventually made landfall near Al Suwaiq in the governorate of Al Batinah North in Oman Shaheen became the first cyclone to hit the country since Cyclone Hikaa in 2019 and was the first cyclone to hit the area since 1890 It was also the first cyclone to enter the Gulf of Oman since Cyclone Gonu in 2007  \n\n\nOctober\nOctober was unusually below-average, featuring only ten storms, with eight of them being named [nb 3] The month also includes an unofficial cyclone named Apollo which formed in the Mediterranean Sea In the East Pacific, two hurricanes named Pamela and Rick formed with both of them impacting Mexico Pamela formed on the southern coast of Zihuatanejo where it made landfall in Sinaloa and then rapidly weakened to a tropical depression Almost a week after Pamela dissipated, Rick formed south of Mexico and made landfall on the country as a Category 2 hurricane In the West Pacific, Typhoon Malou, Tropical storms Lionrock, Kompasu, Namtheun, and along with two tropical depressions formed One of the depressions was named Nando by the PAGASA Nando formed east of another developing tropical depression, where it then merged with the depression and contributed to the formation of Kompasu Lionrock struck Hong Kong, Southern China and Vietnam Kompasu also affected the same area where Lionrock struck a week prior, causing severe loss of life and damage The Atlantic was unusually quiet, only featuring a tropical storm named Wanda Wanda developed from a strong late October nor'easter that had previously affected much of the Northeastern United States The naming of Wanda made the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season the second season in a row after the previous year to run out of names on the standard naming list.\n\n\nNovember\nNovember was an average month in terms of activity, featuring eleven storms, of which six were named The month also includes another unofficial cyclone named Blas which formed in the Mediterranean Sea near Spain In the East Pacific, Tropical Storms Terry and Sandra formed, with both of the storms being named simultaneously on November 7 The West Pacific only featured a super typhoon named Nyatoh which developed near Guam, ending the record-long streak without a major tropical cyclone worldwide since October 3 Nyatoh became the strongest cyclone of November, later crossing into December and dissipating In the North Indian Ocean, three depressions classified as ARB 03, BOB 05 and BOB 06 formed BOB 05 caused severe flooding in Southern India and Sri Lanka which killed more than 40 people, with BOB 06 causing additional damages over the same places; the worst damages occurred in the Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh Additionally, a tropical low formed in the Southern Hemisphere which began the 2021–22 Australian region cyclone season Later, another low formed which was then named Paddy Following Paddy, a few more depressions formed but dissipated a few days later At the end of the month, Tropical Cyclone Teratai formed south of Java but struggled to develop due to the lack of outflow It then re-strengthened back into a tropical storm before weakening again and dissipating.\n\n\nDecember\nDecember was slightly inactive, featuring nine storms, with five of them being named The month started off with the formation of Cyclone Jawad which formed in the North Indian Ocean However, Jawad rapidly weakened due to wind shear shortly after being named, and degenerated into a low-pressure area before it could make landfall over West Bengal The Western Pacific featured a tropical depression classified as 29W and a deadly and destructive typhoon, Typhoon Rai Rai formed east of Palau before rapidly intensifying into a Category 5 super typhoon It then made multiple landfalls on the Philippines causing serious damage Rai then entered the South China Sea, re-strengthening into a Category 5 super typhoon east of Vietnam before dissipating near Hong Kong Rai became the first Category 5 super typhoon since Nock-ten to form in the month on December It was also the third Category 5 super typhoon recorded in the South China Sea, behind Pamela in 1954 and Rammasun in 2014 On the other hand, 29W formed near the equator before making landfall on Peninsular Malaysia, flooding some states within Malaysia The Southern Hemisphere was inactive, only featuring three tropical lows and two cyclones named Ruby and Seth Ruby intensified into a Category 2 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale and entered the South Pacific basin, making it the first storm in the basin Ruby then made landfall on the French overseas island of New Caledonia Seth, on the other hand, first originated in the Arafura Sea It then wandered around the northern regions of Australia before being named in the Solomon Sea The Southern Atlantic featured its third named storm of the year, Subtropical Storm Ubá \n\n\nGlobal effects\nThere are a total of nine tropical cyclone basins, seven are seasonal and two are non-seasonal, thus all seven basins

November 30. The season was highly active, with a total of 21 tropical depressions forming, all of which reached at least tropical or subtropical intensity. The season ranks as the third-most active of all time in the Atlantic basin, behind only 2005 and 2020. Consequently, the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season was the third on record to exhaust its naming list.\n\nNorth Atlantic Ocean\n\nThe 2021 Atlantic hurricane season officially ran from June 1 to November 30.

The season ranks as the third-most active of all time in the Atlantic basin, behind only 2005 and 2020. Consequently, the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season was the third on record to exhaust its naming list.\n\nEastern & Central Pacific Oceans\n\nThe 2021 Pacific hurricane season began on May 15 in the East Pacific and on June 1 in the Central Pacific. Overall activity included 19 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes. The total of named storms was above the 1991–2020 average, while the number of hurricanes was average, and the sum of major hurricanes was below average.\n\nWestern Pacific Ocean\n\nOn January 19, a tropical depression formed, becoming the first Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclone of the year and of the 2021 Pacific typhoon season. It brought minor damage to the Philippines. On February 16, another system formed, with the PAGASA giving it the name Auring and the JTWC designating the system as 01W. It passed over Palau and brought minor damage to the Philippines before dissipating on February 22.\n\nNorth Indian Ocean\n\nOn April 2, a tropical depression formed in the north Andaman Sea near the Myanmar coast. It remained short-lived, however, dissipating the next day. It was the fourth system to form within the first fifteen days of April since the satellite era began in 1960. Formation during this time is considered rare since the first storm of a season usually forms in mid-April or May.\n\nSouth-West Indian Ocean\n\nFrom the 2020 season, two systems crossed into the 2021 season after having formed during the previous year. Danilo was one of the systems that crossed over, peaking as a high-end severe tropical storm and briefly passing near the Mascarene Islands. A tropical depression designated as 05 entered the South-West Indian Ocean basin on December 28 and caused a brief interaction with Danilo before dissipating on January 3.\n\nSouth Pacific Ocean\n\nIn January 2021, four tropical disturbances formed in the South Pacific, all four of which intensified into tropical depressions, with Ana and Bina intensifying into tropical cyclones. In the South Atlantic, one system was unofficially monitored by NOAA, being given the unofficial designation of 01Q. However, the Brazilian Navy did not monitor the system.\n\nAustralian region\n\nAt the beginning of the 2021 season, a new tropical low formed in the Australian region near the Northern Territory of Australia, which further intensified into the first named cyclone of 2021, being given the name Imogen. Its precursor caused catastrophic damage and deadly landslides in the West Nusa Tenggara and East Nusa Tenggara provinces of Indonesia and East Timor, causing 229 fatalities before strengthening to a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone and making a rare landfall on Midwestern Australia, becoming the first since Elaine in 1999.\n\nGlobal effects\n\nThere are a total of nine tropical cyclone basins, seven are seasonal and two are non-seasonal, thus all seven basins except the Mediterranean and South Atlantic are active.

April it had begun to weaken [4] [5] On May 13, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) assessed that the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) transitioned into its neutral phase [6] However, following cooler than normal temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean, NOAA declared that the global weather conditions shifted back to La Niña by October [7]\n\n\nSummary\nThe 2021 Atlantic hurricane season officially ran from June 1 to November 30 A total of 21 tropical depressions formed, all of which reached at least tropical or subtropical intensity The season ranks as the third-most active of all time in the Atlantic basin, behind only 2005 and 2020 Consequently, the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season was the third on record to exhaust its naming list Nine of the systems lasted for two days or less, tied with 2007 for the most since the NHC began monitoring subtropical systems in 1968 Although the season was highly active in terms of the number of named storms, seven of those tropical or subtropical systems intensified into a hurricane and four of those became a major hurricane, which is near-average and just slightly above-average, respectively Nonetheless, 2021 marked the record sixth consecutive above-average season in the Atlantic [10] The ongoing warm Atlantic multidecadal oscillation, which began in 1995, contributed to the season's high level of activity, as it led to above-average sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic basin Other factors included the presence of a La Niña and abnormally heavy West African Monsoon precipitation [11]\n\n\nNorth Atlantic Ocean\nThe 2021 Atlantic hurricane season officially ran from June 1 to November 30 A total of 21 tropical depressions formed, all of which reached at least

Pacific [23] Overall activity included 19 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes The total of named storms was above the 1991–2020 average, while the number of hurricanes was average, and the sum of major hurricanes was below average [24] The official start date was preceded by the formation of Tropical Storm Andres, the earliest named storm on record in the East Pacific [25] It was accompanied by Tropical Storm Blanca later in May [26] The following month included the formations of tropical storms Carlos and Dolores, in addition to Hurricane Enrique While Carlos remained away from land, Dolores made landfall on the Mexico coastline and Enrique delivered impacts across southwestern sections of the country while it passed just offshore [27] Above-average seasonal activity continued into July with the development of hurricanes Felicia and Hilda, Tropical Storm Guillermo, and Tropical Depression Nine-E; none of these cyclones impacted land [28] In August, Hurricane Nora made landfall along the west-central coastline of Mexico Its formation was preceded by Hurricane Linda and tropical storms Ignacio, Kevin, and Marty, which did not impact land [29] September marked a stark turn around to the activity of the previous months, as it only featured Olaf, which struck San José del Cabo as a Category 2 hurricane [30] Two hurricanes – Pamela and Rick – moved ashore the Mexico coastline in October [31] An additional two storms, Terry and Sandra, developed in November, the fourth consecutive November with at least one named storm Furthermore, those cyclones existed simultaneously, the first occurrence in the East Pacific during November on record The Accumulated Cyclone Energy index for the 2021 Pacific hurricane season as calculated by Colorado State University using data from the National Hurricane Center was approximately 94 units, [nb 2] [32] about 30 percent below average.\n\n\nWestern Pacific Ocean\nOn January 19, a tropical depression formed, becoming the first Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclone of the year and of the 2021 Pacific typhoon season It brought minor damage to the Philippines On February 16, another system formed, with the PAGASA giving it the name Auring and the JTWC designating the system as 01W On February 17, it was named Dujuan by the JMA After passing over Palau, it brought minor damage to the Philippines before dissipating on February 22 On March 14, a tropical depression formed near the Sulu Sea, though it was short-lived and it quickly degenerated back into a low-pressure area On April 12, a tropical depression formed south of Woleai, and on the next day, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm, giving it the name Surigae On April 16, it was given the name Bising by the PAGASA as it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility Surigae underwent rapid intensification, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone to form before May in the Northern Hemisphere After bringing severe damages to the Philippines, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on April 24 and dissipated on April 30 On May 12, the JTWC began tracking a tropical depression, giving it the designation 03W with the PAGASA assigning it the local name Crising It made landfall on the Philippines as a weak tropical storm, however damage was minimal due to the storm's small size Two tropical depressions formed near Palau on May 29 and May 30 respectively, with the former being assigned the name Choi-wan by the JMA Choi-wan moved through the Philippines before merging with the Meiyu front on June 4 After a week gap on June 11, another tropical depression formed over the South China Sea and it intensified further to a tropical storm named as Koguma However, it remained short-lived and made landfall over the nation of Vietnam by the next day and soon dissipated thereafter After 10 days on June 21, Tropical Storm Champi formed As a tropical depression, it affected the Mariana Islands and Guam before intensifying into a weak typhoon It became extratropical on 27 June A tropical depression with its Filipino name, Emong, formed a couple hundred miles from Mainland China The storm remained a tropical depression and later dissipated Another tropical depression formed near Vietnam a couple days later, the storm later made landfall in the country as a weak tropical depression A tropical depression formed later in the month having the Filipino name Fabian, later intensifying to  a tropical storm with the JMA giving it the name In-fa In-fa later intensified to a typhoon, made several landfalls in China and dissipated on July 31 Meanwhile, Cempaka formed in the South China Sea and made landfall on Southern China and Vietnam causing moderate damage Later, Tropical Storm Nepartak struck Miyagi Prefecture in Japan The system had disturbed the ongoing Summer Olympics held in Japan Nepartak was also the first tropical storm to hit Miyagi since records began in 1951 By the end of July, activities exploded as 8 systems formed within a week however, 5 of them were rather weak and dissipated without becoming tropical storms The remaining 3 were named Lupit, Nida, and Mirinae Lupit affected most of East Asia while Nida and Mirinae approached Japan but stayed away from land Later, a tropical wave from the Central Pacific traveled a long distance and became a tropical storm over the Philippine Sea, which was named Omais (Isang) Omais caused minor damage to The Ryukyu Islands and South Korea After Omais, the rest of August remained quiet when Conson formed off the coast of the Philippines and became a typhoon in less than 24 hours Conson struck the Philippines and Vietnam causing severe damage Then, Chanthu formed and became the second super typhoon of the season Chanthu then headed over to the East China Sea where the system weakened and stalled It later made landfall over Kyushu, Japan and dissipated south of the country On September 21, two new systems formed and was named Dianmu and Mindulle Dianmu headed over to Vietnam where it made landfall Meanwhile, following Chanthu, Mindulle rapidly intensified into the season's third super typhoon Mindulle weakened and strengthened multiple times due to cool dry air and cool sea-surface temperatures Mindulle eventually passed through Japan's Izu Islands causing minor damage On the start of October, Tropical storm Lionrock formed east of the Philippines and made landfall on the Chinese Island of Hainan Soon, two tropical depressions named Maring and Nando formed However, the two storms eventually merged into Tropical Storm Kompasu due to the storms being close to each other Kompasu then intensified near typhoon strength and affected the same area where Lionrock had struck The storm caused severe damage Later, another tropical depression formed near Wake Island, which was eventually named Namtheun Namtheun however, stayed away from any landmass and became an extratropical cyclone On October 23, a tropical depression formed near Guam which then was named Malou Malou reached its peak as a Category 2 typhoon but it did not effect any land A day after Malou formed, another tropical depression formed near the Philippines and the JTWC designating the system as 26W The storm then made landfall over Vietnam and dissipated In November, Typhon Nyatoh being the only storm of the month formed southeast of Guam and unexpectedly rapidly intensified to a Category 4 super typhoon due to jet interaction However, it was short lived and the JMA declared the storm became a remnant low On December,  Typhoon Rai formed very late during the season and struck Palau and caused severe destruction in the Philippines Rai also became a Category 5 super typhoon twice near the Philippines and in the South China Sea Rai became the first Category 5 super typhoon since Nock-ten to form in the month on December It was also only the third Category 5 super typhoon recorded in the South China Sea, along with Pamela in 1954 and Rammasun in 2014 Additionally, a tropical depression classified as 29W formed near the equator in the South China Sea The depression then made landfall on Malaysia, flooding some states within the country.\n\n\nNorth Indian Ocean\nOn April 2, a tropical depression formed in the north Andaman Sea near the Myanmar coast It remained short-lived, however, dissipating the next day It was the fourth system to form within the first fifteen days of April since the satellite era began in 1960 Formation during this time is considered rare since the first storm of a season usually forms in mid-April or May A month later, on May 14, another tropical depression formed in the Arabian Sea Later that day, it intensified into a cyclonic storm, being assigned the name Tauktae by the IMD It intensified to an extremely severe cyclonic storm and made landfall on Gujarat Ten days later another tropical depression formed in the Bay of Bengal in May 23, before strengthening into a cyclonic storm and receiving the name Yaas It rapidly intensified further to a very severe cyclonic storm and made landfall in Odisha Both of these storms caused considerable loss of lives and damage On September 12, after a long period of inactivity, BOB 03 formed BOB 03 intensified to a deep depression, before making landfall in India It dissipated on September 15 On September 24, a tropical depression formed in the Bay of Bengal It was designated BOB 04 by the IMD In the next two days, it intensified into a cyclonic storm and was named Gulab It made landfall in India Later, the remnants of Gulab later re-intensified into Shaheen in the Arabian Sea Shaheen entered the Gulf of Oman, where it became a Severe Cyclonic Storm However, it struggled to intensify any further, due to lack of convection Shaheen eventually made landfall near Al Suwaiq in the governorate of Al Batinah North in Oman Shaheen became the first cyclone to hit the country since Cyclone Hikaa in 2019 It was also the first cyclone to enter the Gulf of Oman since Cyclone Gonu in 2007 On November 7, ARB 03 formed It stayed out to sea and dissipated two days later On November 10, a tropical depression formed It was designated BOB 05 by the IMD It was short lived, dissipating two days later However, this depression caused severe flooding in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.\n\n\nSouth-West Indian Ocean\nFrom the 2020 season, two systems crossed into the 2021 season after having formed during the previous year The systems were Danilo, which peaked as a high-end severe tropical storm and briefly passed near the Mascarene Islands, and a tropical depression designated as 05 which entered the South-West Indian Ocean basin on December 28, causing a Fujiwhara effect with Danilo before dissipating on January 3 In the 2021 season, a tropical disturbance formed in the South-West Indian Ocean, which intensified into a tropical storm, being given the name Eloise After making landfall on Madagascar, it rapidly intensified into a tropical cyclone in the Mozambique Channel before making a second landfall on Beira Its remnants affected Zimbabwe, Eswatini, and South Africa Joshua entered the basin from the Australian Region on the same day On January 27, 10U from the Australian region entered the basin and was designated as Tropical Depression 09 before quickly dissipating thereafter.\n\n\nJanuary - June\nIn January 2021, four tropical disturbances formed in the South Pacific, all four of which intensified into tropical depressions, with Ana and Bina intensifying into tropical cyclones On February 1, Lucas entered from the Australian region and affected New Caledonia and Vanuatu A tropical depression designated as 09F formed on February 7, before it was upgraded into a tropical storm by the JTWC However, it accelerated southwards and became extratropical on February 11 Another tropical depression designated as 10F formed on February 22, before dissipating on February 24 Niran entered the basin on March 5 and caused extensive damage in New Caledonia before accelerating southeast as it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone On March 5, a

He was the third punter selected in the draft, behind two others in the fourth round. As a rookie, he was named the Bills' starting punter following the release of veteran Matt Haack. Araiza did not dress for the Bills' final preseason game on August 26, 2022, one day after a lawsuit accusing him and two former SDSU teammates of rape became public. He was released the next day, on August 27.\n\nAraiza's NFL career was short-lived, as he was released by the Bills due to a lawsuit accusing him of rape. The allegations against Araiza were serious and had a significant impact on his career. Despite his talent and potential, Araiza was unable to overcome the controversy and was released by the team.\n\n**Buffalo Bills**\n\nThe Buffalo Bills selected Araiza in the sixth round with the 180th overall pick of the 2022 NFL draft. He was the third punter selected in the draft, behind two others in the fourth round. As a rookie, he was named the Bills' starting punter following the release of veteran Matt Haack. Araiza did not dress for the Bills' final preseason game on August 26, 2022, one day after a lawsuit accusing him and two former SDSU teammates of rape became public. He was released the next day, on August 27.\n\nThe Bills' decision to release Araiza was likely due to the negative publicity surrounding the lawsuit. The team may have felt that the distraction and potential negative impact on the team would outweigh any benefits of keeping Araiza on the roster.\n\n**Kansas City Chiefs**\n\nAraiza signed with the Kansas City Chiefs on February 22, 2024, after he had been dropped from the suit. This move suggests that Araiza is looking to revive his career in the NFL, despite the controversy surrounding him. The Chiefs' decision to sign Araiza may be seen as a calculated risk, as the team may be hoping to capitalize on his talent while also minimizing the potential fallout from the lawsuit.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nAraiza is of Mexican descent through his father, who was born in Mexico. He has one older brother. Araiza's personal life has been marked by controversy, with the lawsuit against him and his former teammates dominating headlines.\n\n**Gang Rape Allegations**\n\nIn 2022, Araiza was named as a defendant in a civil case in which two SDSU teammates and he were accused of gang raping a then-17-year-old girl, who was under the age of consent in California, at an off-campus party in 2021. Araiza has denied the allegations, and his lawyer has described the claims as \"a money grab\" from the accuser. However, the accuser has stated that she reported the incident the day after the alleged rape, before she was aware of Araiza's background.\n\nThe allegations against Araiza are serious and have had a significant impact on his career and personal life. The controversy has raised questions about the culture of consent and the treatment of victims in the sports world.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Matt_Araiza\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nAraiza grew up in San Diego, California, and attended Rancho Bernardo High School, where he played football and soccer, and was a hurdler on the track and field team [1] He made 37 field goals and was a two-time All-America selection as a placekicker [2] Araiza committed to play college football at San Diego State University (SDSU) over offers from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the University of Montana [3]\n\n\nCollege career\nAt SDSU, Araiza was redshirted his true freshman season for the Aztecs He served as the backup to All-Mountain West Conference kicker John Baron II [4] Araiza became the team's placekicker as a redshirt freshman and made a school-record 22 field goals on 26 attempts and was named honorable mention All-Mountain West [5] Araiza made 10 of 14 field goal attempts in SDSU's COVID-19-shortened 2020 season and was named honorable mention All-Mountain West for a second straight season He assumed punting duties during the team's opening game against UNLV and averaged 49.8 yards on five punts [6]\n\n\nProfessional career\nThe Buffalo Bills selected Araiza in the sixth round with the 180th overall pick of the 2022 NFL draft [17] He was the third punter selected in the draft, [18] behind two others in the fourth round [19] As a rookie, he was named the Bills' starting punter following the release of veteran Matt Haack [20] Araiza did not dress for the Bills' final preseason game on August 26, 2022, one day after a lawsuit accusing him and two former SDSU teammates of rape became public [21] He was released the next day, on August 27 [22] [23] The Bills said they had become aware of the allegations against Araiza in July, after he was drafted [19]\n\n\nBuffalo Bills\nThe Buffalo Bills selected Araiza in the sixth round with the 180th overall pick of the 2022 NFL draft [17] He was the third punter selected in the draft, [18] behind two others in the fourth round [19] As a rookie, he was named the Bills' starting punter following the release of veteran Matt Haack [20] Araiza did not dress for the Bills' final preseason game on August 26, 2022, one day after a lawsuit accusing him and two former SDSU teammates of rape became public [21] He was released the next day, on August 27 [22] [23] The Bills said they had become aware of the allegations against Araiza in July, after he was drafted [19]\n\n\nKansas City Chiefs\nAraiza signed with the Kansas City Chiefs on February 22, 2024, after he had been dropped from the suit [24]\n\n\nPersonal life\nAraiza is of Mexican descent through his father who was born in Mexico [25] [26] He has one older brother [27]\n\n\nGang rape allegations\nIn 2022, Araiza was named as a defendant in a civil case in which two SDSU teammates and he were accused of gang raping a then-17-year-old girl, who was under the age of consent in California, at an off-campus party in 2021 [23] [13] [28] [29] Araiza has denied the allegations [30] [31] His lawyer described the allegations as \"a money grab\" from the accuser, while she stated that she reported the incident the day after the alleged rape, before she was aware of Araiza's background [32]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is known for his distinctive voice, provocative lyrics, and unapologetic stage presence.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJohn Lydon was born on January 31, 1956, in Holloway, London, England. His parents, Anne and John Lydon, were of Irish descent and met while working in a factory in London. Lydon's early life was marked by poverty and hardship, and he grew up in a working-class neighborhood in North London. He was educated at a Catholic school and developed a strong sense of social justice and a rebellious attitude.\n\n**Career**\n\nIn 1975, Lydon was among a group of youths who regularly hung around Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood's fetish clothing shop Sex. McLaren had returned from a brief stint touring with American proto-punk band the New York Dolls, and he was working on promoting a new band formed by Steve Jones, Glen Matlock, and Paul Cook called the Sex Pistols. Lydon was impressed with Lydon's ragged look and unique sense of style, and he was chosen as the band's lead vocalist.\n\nIn August 1977, the band released \"God Save the Queen\" during the week of Queen Elizabeth II's silver jubilee. The single was a massive commercial success, and Lydon became a household name in the UK. However, the band's success was short-lived, and they disbanded in 1978 due to internal conflicts and personal problems.\n\n**1975–1978: Sex Pistols and the Punk Movement**\n\nThe Sex Pistols were a key part of the punk movement in the late 1970s, which was characterized by its raw energy, rebellious attitude, and rejection of mainstream culture. Lydon was a key figure in the movement, and his lyrics and stage presence helped to define the punk aesthetic. The band's music was a fusion of punk, rock, and reggae, and they were known for their energetic live performances.\n\nDuring the punk movement, Lydon became a symbol of rebellion and nonconformity, and he was often seen as a troublemaker by the establishment. However, he was also a devoted fan of the music and culture of the movement, and he was instrumental in helping to shape its aesthetic and attitude.\n\n**1978–1993: Public Image Ltd (PiL)**\n\nIn 1978, Lydon formed the post-punk band Public Image Ltd (PiL) with bassist Jah Wobble and former Clash guitarist Keith Levene. The band released several albums, including \"Public Image: First Issue\" (1978), \"Metal Box\" (1979), and \"The Flowers of Romance\" (1981). PiL's music was a fusion of post-punk, reggae, and electronic music, and they were known for their experimental and avant-garde sound.\n\nDuring the 1980s, PiL released several more albums, including \"This Is What You Want.. This Is What You Get\" (1984) and \"Disappointed\" (1986). The band's music was less successful than their earlier work, but they maintained a loyal following and continued to tour and release new material.\n\n**1993–2006: Solo Studio Album, Autobiography, and Celebrity Status**\n\nIn 1993, Lydon's first autobiography, \"Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs,\" was published. The book was a critical and commercial success, and it helped to cement Lydon's status as a celebrity and a cultural icon. The book covered his life up until the collapse of the Sex Pistols, and it was a candid and unflinching account of his experiences.\n\nIn the 1990s, Lydon continued to work on music projects, including a solo studio album and a series of live performances with PiL. He also became a prominent figure in British popular culture, and he was featured in numerous films, television shows, and documentaries.\n\n**2006–2009: Potential Sex Pistols Revival**\n\nIn 2002, the Sex Pistols reformed to play the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre in London, and they performed several more live shows in the following years. However, the band's reunion was marked by internal conflicts and personal problems, and they eventually disbanded again in 2009.\n\n**2009–present: Public Image Ltd Reformation**\n\nIn 2009, PiL announced that they would be reforming, with earlier members Bruce Smith and Lu Edmonds. The band released a new album, \"This Is PiL,\" in 2012, and they have since toured and released new material. PiL's music has continued to evolve and experiment, and they remain a influential and innovative force in the music world.\n\n**Origin of Stage Name**\n\nLydon explained the origin of his stage name, Johnny Rotten, in a feature interview with The Daily Telegraph in 2007. He was given the name in the mid-1970s, when his lack of oral hygiene led to his teeth turning green. One version says the name came from the Sex Pistols' guitarist Steve Jones, who saw Lydon's teeth and exclaimed, \"You're rotten, you are!\"\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nLydon was married to Nora Forster, a publishing heiress from Germany, for around 44 years until her death in April 2023.

He spoke of how he would never have considered becoming a US citizen during the \"Bush years\" because of the \"horrible\" way America presented itself abroad, but the Obama presidency had changed his mind, in particular because \"America has the potential to be a nation that actually cares for its afflicted and wounded and ill and disenfranchised\" as a result of the Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\").\n\n**Religious Views**\n\nLydon's parents raised their sons as Roman Catholics, but Lydon is openly critical of the Catholic Church, particularly the sexual abuse cases.

an artificial planet-sized torus also appears in John P Boyd  [Wikidata]'s 1981 short story \"Moonbow\", while Niven wrote of a much larger toroidal megastructure in space in the 1970 novel Ringworld and a much smaller one in the 1973 novel Protector [9] Arthur C Clarke's 1949 short story \"The Wall of Darkness\" is set on a planet bounded by a wall in the shape of an Alice handle, a kind of three-dimensional equivalent of a Möbius strip [1] [16]\n\n\nIn multiple star systems\nPlanets in multiple star systems have attracted attention from science fiction writers, especially in terms of what kind of life would exist on planets with more than one sun and how history might be cyclical as a result of the \"long year\" that occurs if the orbital period around one of the stars is very lengthy [14] [18] [19] A particularly early example of this is C I Defontenay's 1854 novel Star ou Psi de Cassiopée (English title: Star: Psi Cassiopeia), [14] described by science fiction editor David Pringle as \"the first detailed evocation of an alien solar system\", [20] which depicts various alien species inhabiting the planets orbiting the stars [14] [21] [22] [23] Isaac Asimov's 1941 short story \"Nightfall\" portrays a planet which is in constant daylight from at least one of its six suns for millennia at a time before a single night of true darkness, which is a much-anticipated event, [18] [24] [25] the 1963 The Twilight Zone episode \"On Thursday We Leave for Home\" depicts a planet that is challenging for humans to inhabit due to the unending heat and light from a pair of suns, [26] and Mark Hodder's 2012 novel A Red Sun Also Rises is set on a planet where a dim red sun rises at the same time as the planet's twin white suns set [18] Hal Clement's 1957 novel Cycle of Fire depicts a planet in a binary star system where the seasons last for decades and different species dominate the hot and cold parts of the year, [1] [14] [19] Poul Anderson's 1974 novel Fire Time portrays a planet where the majority of the surface becomes uninhabitable approximately once a millennium when it makes a close approach to one of its stars and mass migration of the native lifeforms ensues, [18] and Brian Aldiss's 1982–1985 Helliconia trilogy is set on a planet where the orbital mechanics lead to century-long seasons and there are two distinct ecosystems—one adapted to the short period around the closer star and another adapted to the long year around the more distant one [1] [3] [18] [19] [27] A similar effect appears in Aldiss's 1977 short story \"Creatures of Apogee\", albeit here as a result of a highly eccentric orbit around a single star where the distance to the star thus varies greatly between the nearest and farthest points in the orbit [15] The 1985 anthology Medea: Harlan's World is a collaborative effort between Harlan Ellison and several other science fiction writers consisting of several stories set on the same planet in a multiple star system [1] [14] The 2002 television series Firefly is set in a system of five stars each orbited by its own planetary system, all close enough to each other to permit easy travel between the worlds [18]\n\n\nRogue planets\nPlanets that do not orbit any star, known as rogue planets, appear in several works [14] [28] In the 1977 novel Dying of the Light by George R R Martin, such a planet becomes a temporary tourist destination as it passes by a star before leaving the star's vicinity and becoming uninhabitable again [14] [29] Hal Clement's 1974 short story \"The Logical Life\" explores what kind of life could exist on a planet without a star, [29] while the 2002 Star Trek: Enterprise episode \"Rogue Planet\" depicts how the lifeforms on a world of perpetual night might be exploited by outsiders [28] Earth is threatened by impact with a rogue planet in the 1933 novel When Worlds Collide by Edwin Balmer and Philip Wylie and its 1951 film adaptation, [28] and becomes a rogue planet itself in Fritz Leiber's 1951 short story \"A Pail of Air\" [28] [29] A rogue planet on a collision course with a star-orbiting planet also appears in Neil R Jones's 1934 short story \"The Sunless World\", though here the rogue planet is the inhabited one [14] [30]\n\n\nPhysical environment\nPortraying planets with conditions that differ significantly from Earth's in terms of physical environment has been a recurring practice since the middle of the 1900s [3] Many of these stories imagine how indigenous lifeforms might be adapted to those conditions, with Hal Clement and Poul Anderson being particularly prolific exponents of this craft [7] [12] [31] The high gravity of Mesklin in Clement's Mission of Gravity thus results in its inhabitants having a centipede-like body structure, [1] [9] [31] [32] while the low gravity yet dense atmosphere in Anderson's 1958 novel War of the Wing-Men (a.k.a The Man Who Counts) makes it possible for humanoid creatures to fly using their own wings [1] [3] [31] Desert planets are common; astrophysicist Elizabeth Stanway  [Wikidata] posits that this is because the setting strikes the right balance between novelty and familiarity to most audiences, in addition to the relative inhospitality providing a survival aspect to the narrative [33] One of the most prominent examples thereof is Arrakis in Frank Herbert's 1965 novel Dune, where the extreme scarcity of water influences all aspects of the planet's ecology and society [1] [3] [32] [33] [34] Less extreme desert conditions are found on the Star Wars planet Tatooine, with more plentiful and varied lifeforms as a result [33] At the other end of the spectrum are planets covered entirely by water, an early example of which appears in Neil R Jones's 1933 short story \"Into the Hydrosphere\" [14] [31] Joan Slonczewski's 1986 novel A Door into Ocean is a piece of feminist science fiction set on an ocean world with an all-female population, [1] [3] while Ursula K Le Guin's 1969 novel The Left Hand of Darkness is set on a frigid world of perpetual winter where the inhabitants do not have a fixed sex [34] [35] [36] One of the planets in the 2014 film Interstellar is covered by a shallow ocean and orbits so closely around a black hole that there are both tidal waves the height of mountains and extreme time dilation [35] Other fictional planets differ in their chemical rather than physical environment Chlorine planets appear in Isaac Asimov's 1951 short story \"C-Chute\" and the 1976 Space: 1999 episode \"The AB Chrysalis\", [26] while C J Cherryh's 1988 novel Cyteen depicts a planet dominated by silicon-based life whose biochemistry creates byproducts extremely hazardous to human health [37]\n\n\nLiving\nPlanets themselves being portrayed as alive, while relatively rare (especially compared to stars receiving the same treatment), is a recurring theme [1] [38] Sentient planets appear in Ray Bradbury's 1951 short story \"Here There Be Tygers\", Stanisław Lem's 1961 novel Solaris, and Terry Pratchett's 1976 novel The Dark Side of the Sun [1] [38] Ego the Living Planet is a recurring character in Marvel Comics [38] The related concept known as the Gaia hypothesis—an entire planetary ecosphere functioning as a single organism, often but not always imbued with a planet-wide consciousness—is more common;

With the discovery of thousands of exoplanets in recent years, the possibilities for imaginative storytelling have expanded exponentially. Since information about extrasolar planets remains limited and incomplete, science fiction writers can freely imagine various sorts of alien worlds where their heroes might experience different sorts of adventures and encounter exotic aliens. This creative freedom has led to a wide range of fictional planets, each with its unique characteristics, environments, and inhabitants.\n\n**Exotic Shapes**\n\nVarious exotic planetary shapes appear in fiction. In Hal Clement's 1953 novel Mission of Gravity, the planet Mesklin's rapid rotation causes it to be shaped roughly like a flat disk. Gravity is consequently about 200 times weaker at the equator than it is at the poles. Another disk-shaped planet is the Discworld of Terry Pratchett's 1983-2015 fantasy book series, a flat world which is carried on the backs of elephants that are in turn carried on the back of a turtle, with the arrangement orbited by the world's sun. Bizarro World in the Superman franchise is a cubic planet, rendered that shape by the actions of Superman. Earth itself gets turned into a cube in Henry H Gross's 1987 short story \"Cubeworld\", and an altogether artificial planet-sized cube is the setting of G David Nordley's 2009 novel To Climb a Flat Mountain. Double planets close enough together to share an atmosphere through their Roche lobes appear in Homer Eon Flint's 1921 short story \"The Devolutionist\", Robert L Forward's 1982 novel Rocheworld (a.k.a The Flight of the Dragonfly), Bob Shaw's 1986 novel The Ragged Astronauts—which depicts an interplanetary hot air balloon expedition—and Charles Sheffield's 1990 novel Summertide. A planet in the shape of a torus is the setting of Flint's 1921 short story \"The Emancipatrix\", being the result of the protoplanetary disk condensing so quickly that it did not coalesce into a spherical shape first; an artificial planet-sized torus also appears in John P Boyd's 1981 short story \"Moonbow\", while Niven wrote of a much larger toroidal megastructure in space in the 1970 novel Ringworld and a much smaller one in the 1973 novel Protector. Arthur C Clarke's 1949 short story \"The Wall of Darkness\" is set on a planet bounded by a wall in the shape of an Alice handle, a kind of three-dimensional equivalent of a Möbius strip.\n\n**In Multiple Star Systems**\n\nPlanets in multiple star systems have attracted attention from science fiction writers, especially in terms of what kind of life would exist on planets with more than one sun and how history might be cyclical as a result of the \"long year\" that occurs if the orbital period around one of the stars is very lengthy. A particularly early example of this is C I Defontenay's 1854 novel Star ou Psi de Cassiopée (English title: Star: Psi Cassiopeia), described by science fiction editor David Pringle as \"the first detailed evocation of an alien solar system\", which depicts various alien species inhabiting the planets orbiting the stars. Isaac Asimov's 1941 short story \"Nightfall\" portrays a planet which is in constant daylight from at least one of its six suns for millennia at a time before a single night of true darkness, which is a much-anticipated event. The 1963 The Twilight Zone episode \"On Thursday We Leave for Home\" depicts a planet that is challenging for humans to inhabit due to the unending heat and light from a pair of suns, and Mark Hodder's 2012 novel A Red Sun Also Rises is set on a planet where a dim red sun rises at the same time as the planet's twin white suns set. Hal Clement's 1957 novel Cycle of Fire depicts a planet in a binary star system where the seasons last for decades and different species dominate the hot and cold parts of the year. Poul Anderson's 1974 novel Fire Time portrays a planet where the majority of the surface becomes uninhabitable approximately once a millennium when it makes a close approach to one of its stars and mass migration of the native lifeforms ensues. Brian Aldiss's 1982-1985 Helliconia trilogy is set on a planet where the orbital mechanics lead to century-long seasons and there are two distinct ecosystems—one adapted to the short period around the closer star and another adapted to the long year around the more distant one. A similar effect appears in Aldiss's 1977 short story \"Creatures of Apogee\", albeit here as a result of a highly eccentric orbit around a single star where the distance to the star thus varies greatly between the nearest and farthest points in the orbit. The 1985 anthology Medea: Harlan's World is a collaborative effort between Harlan Ellison and several other science fiction writers consisting of several stories set on the same planet in a multiple star system. The 2002 television series Firefly is set in a system of five stars each orbited by its own planetary system, all close enough to each other to permit easy travel between the worlds.\n\n**Rogue Planets**\n\nPlanets that do not orbit any star, known as rogue planets, appear in several works. In the 1977 novel Dying of the Light by George R R Martin, such a planet becomes a temporary tourist destination as it passes by a star before leaving the star's vicinity and becoming uninhabitable again. Hal Clement's 1974 short story \"The Logical Life\" explores what kind of life could exist on a planet without a star, while the 2002 Star Trek: Enterprise episode \"Rogue Planet\" depicts how the lifeforms on a world of perpetual night might be exploited by outsiders. Earth is threatened by impact with a rogue planet in the 1933 novel When Worlds Collide by Edwin Balmer and Philip Wylie and its 1951 film adaptation, and becomes a rogue planet itself in Fritz Leiber's 1951 short story \"A Pail of Air\". A rogue planet on a collision course with a star-orbiting planet also appears in Neil R Jones's 1934 short story \"The Sunless World\", though here the rogue planet is the inhabited one.\n\n**Physical Environment**\n\nPortraying planets with conditions that differ significantly from Earth's in terms of physical environment has been a recurring practice since the middle of the 1900s. Many of these stories imagine how indigenous lifeforms might be adapted to those conditions, with Hal Clement and Poul Anderson being particularly prolific exponents of this craft. The high gravity of Mesklin in Clement's Mission of Gravity thus results in its inhabitants having a centipede-like body structure, while the low gravity yet dense atmosphere in Anderson's 1958 novel War of the Wing-Men (a.k.a The Man Who Counts) makes it possible for humanoid creatures to fly using their own wings. Desert planets are common; astrophysicist Elizabeth Stanway posits that this is because the setting strikes the right balance between novelty and familiarity to most audiences, in addition to the relative inhospitality providing a survival aspect to the narrative. One of the most prominent examples thereof is Arrakis in Frank Herbert's 1965 novel Dune, where the extreme scarcity of water influences all aspects of the planet's ecology and society. Less extreme desert conditions are found on the Star Wars planet Tatooine, with more plentiful and varied lifeforms as a result. At the other end of the spectrum are planets covered entirely by water, an early example of which appears in Neil R Jones's 1933 short story \"Into the Hydrosphere\". Joan Slonczewski's 1986 novel A Door into Ocean is a piece of feminist science fiction set on an ocean world with an all-female population, while Ursula K Le Guin's 1969 novel The Left Hand of Darkness is set on a frigid world of perpetual winter where the inhabitants do not have a fixed sex. One of the planets in the 2014 film Interstellar is covered by a shallow ocean and orbits so closely around a black hole that there are both tidal waves the height of mountains and extreme time dilation.\n\n**Living**\n\nPlanets themselves being portrayed as alive, while relatively rare (especially compared to stars receiving the same treatment), is a recurring theme. Sentient planets appear in Ray Bradbury's 1951 short story \"Here There Be Tygers\", Stanisław Lem's 1961 novel Solaris, and Terry Pratchett's 1976 novel The Dark Side of the Sun. Ego the Living Planet is a recurring character in Marvel Comics. The related concept known as the Gaia hypothesis—an entire planetary ecosphere functioning as a single organism, often but not always imbued with a planet-wide consciousness—is more common; examples include Murray Leinster's 1949 short story \"The Lonely Planet\", Isaac Asimov's 1982 novel Foundation's Edge, and the 2009 film Avatar.\n\n**List**\n\nThe following are fictional extrasolar planets with stand-alone Wikipedia articles.\n\n* Acheron (Star Wars)\n* Arrakis (Dune)\n* Daedra (The Expanse)\n* Dantooine (Star Wars)\n* K-2SO (Star Wars)\n* Kepler-452b (Star Trek: Discovery)\n* Kepler-62f (Star Trek: Discovery)\n* Mars (Star Trek: Discovery)\n* Mirax (Star Wars)\n* Nal Hutta (Star Wars)\n* Onderon (Star Wars)\n* Phobos (Star Trek: Discovery)\n* Rannoch (The Expanse)\n* Rigel 3 (Star Trek: Discovery)\n* Rigel 4 (Star Trek: Discovery)\n* Ryloth (Star Wars)\n* Tatooine (Star Wars)\n* Titan (Star Trek: Discovery)\n* Xylophia-IV (The Expanse)\n\n**See also**\n\n* Exoplanet\n* Planet\n* Science fiction\n* Astrobiology\n* Astrology\n* Astronomy\n* Space exploration\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on a summary of various sources, including books, articles, and online resources.\n* The list of fictional extrasolar planets is not exhaustive, and new sources may be added in the future.\n\n**References**\n\n* Asimov, Isaac. \"Nightfall\".

astrophysicist Elizabeth Stanway  [Wikidata] posits that this is because the setting strikes the right balance between novelty and familiarity to most audiences, in addition to the relative inhospitality providing a survival aspect to the narrative [33] One of the most prominent examples thereof is Arrakis in Frank Herbert's 1965 novel Dune, where the extreme scarcity of water influences all aspects of the planet's ecology and society [1] [3] [32] [33] [34] Less extreme desert conditions are found on the Star Wars planet Tatooine, with more plentiful and varied lifeforms as a result [33] At the other end of the spectrum are planets covered entirely by water, an early example of which appears in Neil R Jones's 1933 short story \"Into the Hydrosphere\" [14] [31] Joan Slonczewski's 1986 novel A Door into Ocean is a piece of feminist science fiction set on an ocean world with an all-female population, [1] [3] while Ursula K Le Guin's 1969 novel The Left Hand of Darkness is set on a frigid world of perpetual winter where the inhabitants do not have a fixed sex [34] [35] [36] One of the planets in the 2014 film Interstellar is covered by a shallow ocean and orbits so closely around a black hole that there are both tidal waves the height of mountains and extreme time dilation [35] Other fictional planets differ in their chemical rather than physical environment Chlorine planets appear in Isaac Asimov's 1951 short story \"C-Chute\" and the 1976 Space: 1999 episode \"The AB Chrysalis\", [26] while C J Cherryh's 1988 novel Cyteen depicts a planet dominated by silicon-based life whose biochemistry creates byproducts extremely hazardous to human health [37]\n\n\nLiving\nPlanets themselves being portrayed as alive, while relatively rare (especially compared to stars receiving the same treatment), is a recurring theme [1] [38] Sentient planets appear in Ray Bradbury's 1951 short story \"Here There Be Tygers\", Stanisław Lem's 1961 novel Solaris, and Terry Pratchett's 1976 novel The Dark Side of the Sun [1] [38] Ego the Living Planet is a recurring character in Marvel Comics [38] The related concept known as the Gaia hypothesis—an entire planetary ecosphere functioning as a single organism, often but not always imbued with a planet-wide consciousness—is more common; examples include Murray Leinster's 1949 short story \"The Lonely Planet\", Isaac Asimov's 1982 novel Foundation's Edge, and the 2009 film Avatar [38] [39] [40]\n\n\nList\nThe following are fictional extrasolar planets with stand-alone Wikipedia articles.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

She is a renowned humanitarian, environmentalist, and philanthropist, known for her tireless efforts to promote peace, justice, and human rights around the world.\n\n**Family and Early Life**\n\nQueen Noor was born on August 23, 1951, in Washington, D.C., to Najeeb Halaby and Doris Carlquist. Her paternal family is of Syrian descent, while her maternal family is of Swedish-American origin. Her father, Najeeb Halaby, was a successful businessman and government official who served as an aide to the United States Secretary of Defense during the Truman administration. He later became the CEO of Pan American World Airways from 1969 to 1972.\n\nQueen Noor's childhood was marked by a nomadic lifestyle, with her family moving between Washington, D.C., New York, and California. She attended schools in New York and California before entering National Cathedral School in Washington, D.C., from fourth to eighth grade. She then attended the Chapin School in New York City for two years, before graduating from Concord Academy.\n\n**Education**\n\nAfter graduating from Concord Academy, Queen Noor attended Princeton University, where she earned a Bachelor's degree in architecture in 1975. Her interest in architecture and urban planning led her to pursue a career in these fields. After graduating from Princeton, she moved to Australia, where she worked for a firm that specialized in planning new towns. This experience sparked her interest in the Middle East, particularly due to her Syrian roots.\n\n**Career**\n\nIn 1975, Queen Noor accepted a job offer from Llewelyn Davies, a British architectural and planning firm, which had been employed to design a model capital city center in Tehran, Iran. However, increasing political instability forced the company to relocate to the UK, and Queen Noor traveled to the Arab world, where she decided to apply to Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism. She also took a temporary aviation facility research job in Amman, Jordan.\n\nIn 1977, Queen Noor left Arab Air and accepted a job with Alia Airlines to become Director of Facilities Planning and Design. It was during this time that she met King Hussein, who was still mourning the death of his third wife. Their friendship evolved, and they became engaged in 1978.\n\n**Marriage and Children**\n\nQueen Noor married King Hussein on June 15, 1978, in Amman, becoming the Queen of Jordan. They had four children together: Abdullah II, Faisal, Zein, and Hamzah.\n\n**Areas of Work**\n\nQueen Noor has been involved in various humanitarian and philanthropic endeavors throughout her life. In 1979, she founded the King Hussein Foundation (KHF), which includes the Noor Al Hussein Foundation and eight specialized development institutions. These institutions focus on areas such as education, healthcare, economic development, and community development.\n\nIn addition to her work with the KHF, Queen Noor has launched several other initiatives, including the International Arab Youth Congress, which aims to promote youth development and empowerment in the Arab world. She has also been involved in various environmental initiatives, including the preservation of the Jordanian environment and the promotion of sustainable development.\n\n**Domestic Agenda**\n\nAs Queen of Jordan, Queen Noor has been involved in various domestic initiatives, including the promotion of education, healthcare, and economic development. She has also been a strong advocate for women's rights and empowerment, recognizing the importance of women's participation in the country's development.\n\n**International Agenda**\n\nQueen Noor's international work focuses on environmental issues and the connection to human security, with an emphasis on water and ocean health. At the 2017 Our Ocean Conference, she delivered a keynote address on the link between climate change and ocean health with human security. She has also been involved in various international initiatives, including the promotion of sustainable development, human rights, and peace.\n\n**Widowhood**\n\nKing Hussein died on February 7, 1999, from lymphatic cancer. After his death, his first-born son, Abdullah II, became king, and Hamzah became crown prince. In 2004, Prince Hamzah was unexpectedly stripped of his status as heir designate. On July 2, 2009, Abdullah named his eldest son as heir-apparent to the throne, thereby ending the previous five years' speculation over his successor.\n\n**Honours**\n\nQueen Noor has received numerous national and international honors for her contributions to humanitarian and philanthropic work. These honors include the King Hussein Leadership Prize, the United Nations Environment Programme's Champion of the Earth Award, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature's President's Medal.\n\n**Books Written by Queen Noor**\n\nQueen Noor has written several books, including \"Leap of Faith: Memoirs of an Unexpected Life\" and \"Cries from Syria: Stories of War from the Streets of Homs\". Her books offer a glimpse into her experiences as a humanitarian and a member of the Jordanian royal family.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* King Hussein of Jordan\n* Abdullah II of Jordan\n* Hamzah of Jordan\n* King Hussein Foundation\n* Noor Al Hussein Foundation\n* International Arab Youth Congress\n* Our Ocean Conference\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Official website of Queen Noor\n* King Hussein Foundation\n* Noor Al Hussein Foundation\n* International Arab Youth Congress\n* Our Ocean Conference", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Queen_Noor_of_Jordan\" following this outline:\n\n\nFamily and early life\nQueen Noor was born Lisa Najeeb Halaby [3] in Washington, D.C., U.S., the eldest child of Najeeb Halaby (1915–2003) and Doris Carlquist (1918–2015) Her paternal family is Syrian;

She began to transition from juvenile roles to more sophisticated adult characters. Her subsequent role as Nicole Burnell in Egoyan's 1997 film \"The Sweet Hereafter\" brought her considerable attention in the United States. Her character in the film was an aspiring singer, and on the film's soundtrack, she performed covers of The Tragically Hip's \"Courage\" and Jane Siberry's \"One More Colour.\"\n\n**Adult Acting**\n\nBy the time she was 13, Polley was dissatisfied with her juvenile acting career. Her experience with Egoyan in \"Exotica\" turned things around, and she began to take on more adult roles. She appeared as Lily on the CBC television series \"Straight Up,\" which ran from 1996 to 1998. She won the Gemini Award for Best Performance in a Children's or Youth Program or Series for her role.\n\nIn 2001, Polley made her feature-length film debut as Justine in \"No Such Thing,\" directed by Hal Hartley. She also appeared in the film \"The Secret Life of Words,\" directed by Isabel Coixet, in 2005. Her role as Claire in the film \"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus\" in 2009 marked a departure from her usual dramatic roles, as she played a character who is a part of a fantastical world.\n\n**Directing**\n\nIn 1999, Polley made her first short film, \"The Best Day of My Life,\" for the On the Fly 4 Film Festival. She also made a second short film that year, \"Don't Think Twice.\" Polley attended the Canadian Film Centre's directing program in 2001, and won the Genie Award for Best Live Action Short Drama in 2003 for her short film \"I Shout Love.\" She made her feature-length film directing debut with \"Away from Her,\" which Polley adapted from the Alice Munro short story \"The Bear Came Over the Mountain.\" The movie, starring Julie Christie, debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2006.\n\n**Writing**\n\nPolley has written numerous essays over the years about her experiences as a child star. In 2022, she released her first book of essays, \"Run Towards the Danger,\" which contains six essays that examine aspects of Polley's career on stage, screen, and on film. The book also revealed for the first time that Polley had been a victim of Jian Ghomeshi, who sexually and physically assaulted her when she was 16 and he was 28.\n\n**Political and Social Activism**\n\nFollowing the row with Disney as a twelve-year-old for wearing a peace sign to protest against the Gulf War, Polley dedicated more of her efforts to politics. She became a prominent member of the Ontario New Democratic Party (ONDP), where Ontario legislator Peter Kormos was her political mentor. In 1996, she gave a nomination speech for Kormos at the ONDP leadership convention, which she later referred to as the \"proudest moment in my life.\"\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nIn 2007, Polley discovered the man who raised her, Michael Polley, was not her biological father. The story of her mother's affair with her biological father, producer Harry Gulkin, was chronicled in her 2012 film, \"Stories We Tell.\"\n\n**Filmography**\n\n**Short Films**\n\n* \"The Best Day of My Life\" (1999)\n* \"Don't Think Twice\" (1999)\n\n**Film Production**\n\n* \"Away from Her\" (2006)\n* \"Stories We Tell\" (2012)\n\n**Film Acting**\n\n* \"One Magic Christmas\" (1985)\n* \"Friday the 13th – The Series\" (1987)\n* \"Ramona\" (1988)\n* \"Exotica\" (1994)\n* \"The Sweet Hereafter\" (1997)\n* \"No Such Thing\" (2001)\n* \"The Secret Life of Words\" (2005)\n* \"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus\" (2009)\n\n**Television**\n\n* \"Straight Up\" (1996-1998)\n* \"Road to Avonlea\" (1989-1996)\n\n**Awards and Nominations**\n\n* Star on Canada's Walk of Fame (2010)\n* National Arts Centre Award (2013)\n* Officer of the Order of Canada (2013)\n\n**References**\n\n* \n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sarah_Polley\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nSarah Ellen Polley was born on January 8, 1979 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, [7] [8] the youngest of five children born to Diane Elizabeth Polley (née MacMillan) Her siblings are Susy and John Buchan from Diane's first marriage to George Deans-Buchan, and Mark and Joanna Polley from her second marriage to Michael Polley (1933–2018), a British-born actor who became an insurance agent after starting a family with Diane [9] [10]\n\n\nCareer\nHer first appearance on screen was at the age of four, [22] as Molly in the film One Magic Christmas She was in the pilot episode for Friday the 13th – The Series and appeared in a small role in William Fruet's sci-fi horror film Blue Monkey, both in 1987  At age of eight, she was cast as Ramona Quimby in the television series Ramona, based on Beverly Cleary's books.\n\n\nChild acting\nHer first appearance on screen was at the age of four, [22] as Molly in the film One Magic Christmas She was in the pilot episode for Friday the 13th – The Series and appeared in a small role in William Fruet's sci-fi horror film Blue Monkey, both in 1987  At age of eight, she was cast as Ramona Quimby in the television series Ramona, based on Beverly Cleary's books.\n\n\nAdult acting\nPolley appeared as Lily on the CBC television series Straight Up, which ran from 1996 to 1998, winning the Gemini Award for Best Performance in a Children's or Youth Program or Series for her role By age thirteen, however, Polley was dissatisfied with her juvenile acting career Her experience with director Atom Egoyan in a small but critical role in his sophisticated adult drama Exotica turned things around, as she revealed in a 2022 conversation with the director, filmed for Criterion's Exotica BluRay  Polley's subsequent role as Nicole Burnell in Egoyan's 1997 film The Sweet Hereafter brought her considerable attention in the United States;

{"title": "Wayne_Gretzky", "content": "\nEarly life\nWayne Douglas Gretzky was born on January 26, 1961, in Brantford, Ontario, the son of Phyllis Leone (Hockin) and Walter Gretzky [5] [11] The couple married in 1960, and lived in an apartment in Brantford, where Walter worked for Bell Telephone Canada [12] The family moved into a house on Varadi Avenue in Brantford seven months after Wayne was born, chosen partly because its yard was flat enough to make an ice rink [13] Wayne had a sister, Kim (born 1963), and brothers Keith, Glen and Brent The family regularly visited the farm of Wayne's grandparents, Tony and Mary, and watched Hockey Night in Canada together By age two, Wayne was trying to score goals against Mary using a souvenir stick [14] The farm was where Wayne skated on ice for the first time, aged two years, 10 months [14]\n\n\nWorld Hockey Association\nBy 1978, the World Hockey Association, which had competed with the established NHL since 1972, was struggling The league, which at one point iced fourteen teams, was down to seven surviving franchises The WHA had long sought to arrange a merger with the NHL but were constantly rebuffed by a group of hardline owners in the older league With the WHA's long-term survival in doubt, Birmingham Bulls owner John F Bassett believed the only way to gain meaningful leverage over the NHL was to sign as many young and promising superstars as possible The NHL did not allow the signing of players under age 20, but the WHA had no such rules Bassett saw Gretzky as the most promising young prospect [31] Several WHA teams courted Gretzky, notably the Bulls and the Indianapolis Racers.\n\n\nNHL career\n\nGretzky's success in the WHA carried over into the NHL, despite some critics suggesting he would struggle in what was considered the bigger, tougher, and more talented league [50] \n\nEdmonton Oilers (1979–1988)\n\nGretzky's success in the WHA carried over into the NHL, despite some critics suggesting he would struggle in what was considered the bigger, tougher, and more talented league [50] \n\nThe Gretzky rule\nIn June 1985, as part of a package of five rule changes to be implemented for the 1985–86 season, the NHL Board of Governors decided to introduce offsetting penalties, where neither team lost a man when coincidental penalties were called The effect of calling offsetting penalties was felt immediately in the NHL because during the early 1980s, when the Gretzky-era Oilers entered a four-on-four or three-on-three situation with an opponent, they frequently used the space on the ice to score one or more goals [76] [77] A few days later, during a press conference the day after being awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy, Gretzky criticized the NHL for punishing teams and players who previously benefited The rule change became known as \"the Gretzky rule\" [76] [78] The rule was reversed for the 1992–93 season, by which time a majority of the players from the all-time powerhouse Edmonton Oilers (the 1984–85 Oilers team, the one most directly impacted by the June 1985 rule change, was later voted the greatest NHL team ever, as part of the NHL's centennial celebrations) [79] had changed teams or retired from hockey [80]\n\n\nStrategy and effect on NHL play\nGretzky had a major influence on the style of play of the Edmonton Oilers and the NHL as a whole, helping to inspire a more team-based strategy Using this approach, the Oilers, led by Gretzky, became the highest-scoring team in NHL history [81]\n\n\n\"The Trade\"\nTwo hours after the Oilers won the Stanley Cup in 1988, Gretzky learned from his father that the Oilers were planning to deal him to another team [86] Walter Gretzky had known for months after having been tipped off by Skalbania, but kept the news from Wayne so as not to upset him According to Walter, Wayne was being \"shopped\" to Los Angeles, Detroit, and Vancouver, and Pocklington needed money as his other business ventures were not doing well [87] At first, Gretzky did not want to leave Edmonton, but he received a call while on his honeymoon from Los Angeles Kings owner Bruce McNall, who asked permission to meet and discuss the deal Gretzky informed McNall that his prerequisites for a deal to take place were that Marty McSorley and Mike Krushelnyski join him as teammates in Los Angeles Both McNall and Pocklington quickly agreed After the details of the trade were finalized by the two owners, one final condition had to be met: Gretzky had to call Pocklington and request a trade [88] When Pocklington told Oilers general manager and head coach Sather about his plans to trade Gretzky to Los Angeles, Sather tried to stop the deal, but when he found out that Gretzky had been involved in the negotiations, he changed his attitude and requested Luc Robitaille in exchange The Kings refused, instead offering Jimmy Carson [89]\n\n\nLos Angeles Kings (1988–1996)\nThe Kings named Gretzky their alternate captain He made an immediate impact on the ice, scoring on his first shot on goal in the first regular season game [98] The Kings got off to their best start ever, winning four straight en route to qualifying for the playoffs For only the second time in his NHL career, Gretzky finished second in scoring, but narrowly edged the Pittsburgh Penguins' Mario Lemieux (who scored 199 points) for the Hart Trophy as MVP [99]\n\n\nSt. Louis Blues (1996)\nOn February 27, 1996, Gretzky joined the St Louis Blues in a trade for Patrice Tardif, Roman Vopat, Craig Johnson and two draft picks (Peter Hogan and Matt Zultek) [65] He partially orchestrated the trade after reports surfaced that he was unhappy in Los Angeles [111] At the time of the trade, the Blues and New York Rangers emerged as front-runners, but the Blues met his salary demands [112] Gretzky was immediately named the team's captain He scored 37 points in 31 games for the team in the regular season and the playoffs, [64] and the Blues came within one game of the Conference Finals [113]\n\n\nNew York Rangers (1996–1999)\nGretzky ended his professional playing career with the New York Rangers, where he played his final three seasons and helped the team reach the Eastern Conference Finals in 1997 [116] The Rangers were defeated in the Conference Finals in five games by the Philadelphia Flyers, despite Gretzky leading the Rangers in the playoffs with 10 goals and 10 assists [64] For the first time in his NHL career, Gretzky was not named captain, [117] except for a brief period as acting captain in 1998 when captain Brian Leetch was injured and out of the line-up [118] After the 1996–97 season, Mark Messier signed a free agent contract with the Vancouver Canucks, ending the brief reunion of Messier and Gretzky after just one season [119] The 1997 playoff run was Gretzky's last as a player, and Rangers did not return to the playoffs until 2006, well after Gretzky retired [120] Along with Jaromir Jagr, he topped the NHL in 1997–98 with 67 assists It was the 16th time in 19 seasons that Gretzky earned at least a share of the league lead in the statistic [121]\n\n\nInternational play\nGretzky made his first international appearance as a member of the Canadian national junior team at the 1978 World Junior Championships in Montreal, Quebec The Canadian coach, Punch McLean, was originally skeptical of Gretzky's ability as he was the youngest player to compete in the tournament at the age of 16 [130] [131] He went on to lead the tournament in scoring with 17 points to earn All-Star Team and Best Forward honours [131] His 17 points remain the most scored by a 16-year-old in the World Junior Championships [132] Canada finished with the bronze medal [131] [133]\n\n\nSkills and influences\nGretzky's size and strength were unimpressive—in fact, far below average for the NHL—but he is widely considered the smartest player in the history of the game [142] [143] [144] His reading of the game and his ability to improvise on the fly were unrivaled, and he could consistently anticipate where the puck was going to be and execute the right move at the right time [29] His coach at the Edmonton Oilers, Glen Sather, said, \"He was so much more intelligent While they were using all this energy trying to rattle his teeth, he was just skating away, circling, analyzing things.\" [145]\n\n\nStyle of play\nGretzky's size and strength were unimpressive—in fact, far below average for the NHL—but he is widely considered the smartest player in the history of the game [142] [143] [144] His reading of the game and his ability to improvise on the fly were unrivaled, and he could consistently anticipate where the puck was going to be and execute the right move at the right time [29] His coach at the Edmonton Oilers, Glen Sather, said, \"He was so much more intelligent While they were using all this energy trying to rattle his teeth, he was just skating away, circling, analyzing things.\" [145]\n\n\nPhysical attributes\nWhen he entered the league in 1979, critics opined that Gretzky was \"too small, too wiry, and too slow to be a force in the  [NHL].\" [156] He weighed 160 pounds (73 kg), compared to the NHL average of 189 pounds (86 kg) at that time [157] But that year, Gretzky tied for first place in scoring, and won the Hart Trophy for the league's most valuable player [158] In his second year in the league, weighing just 165 pounds, he broke the previous single-season scoring record, racking up 164 points [159] The next year (1981–82), at 170 pounds—still \"a wisp compared to the average NHL player\"—he set the all-time goal-scoring record, putting 92 pucks in the net [160] He weighed \"about 170 pounds\" for the better part of his career [161] He consistently scored last in strength tests among the Edmonton Oilers, bench pressing only 140 pounds (64 kg) [162]\n\n\nPost-retirement\nGretzky was named honorary chairman of the Open Ice Summit, held in August 1999 to discuss ways to improve Canadian ice hockey [173] He stressed the need to play and practice hockey for the love of the game, [174] and felt that skill was more important to develop than talent and that Canada had the potential to be world leaders in skill development [173]\n\n\nPhoenix Coyotes\nAlmost immediately after retirement, several NHL teams approached Gretzky about an ownership role [186] In May 2000, he agreed to buy a 10% stake in the Phoenix Coyotes in a partnership with majority owner Steve Ellman, taking on the roles of alternate governor, managing partner and head of hockey operations [187] The Coyotes were in the process of being sold and Ellman convinced Gretzky to come on board, averting a potential move to Portland, Oregon [187] The sale was not completed until the following year, on February 15, 2001, after two missed deadlines while securing financing and partners before Ellman and Gretzky could take over Trucking magnate and Arizona Diamondbacks part-owner Jerry Moyes was added to the partnership [188] [189] Gretzky convinced his long-time agent Michael Barnett to join the team as its General Manager [190]\n\n\nWinter Olympics\nGretzky was executive director of the Canadian men's hockey team at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah On February 18, he lashed out at the media at a press conference, frustrated with media and fan comments regarding his team's uninspiring 1–1–1 start [201] His temper boiled over after Canada's 3–3 draw versus the Czech Republic, as he launched a tirade against the perceived negative reputation of Team Canada amongst other national squads, and called rumours of dissent in the dressing room the result of \"American propaganda\" \"They're loving us not doing well\", he said, referring to American hockey fans [201] American fans online began calling Gretzky a \"crybaby\"; defenders said he was merely borrowing a page from former coach Glen Sather to take the pressure off his players Gretzky addressed those comments by saying he spoke out to protect the Canadian players, and the tirade was not \"staged\" [202] The Canadian team won the gold medal, its first in 50 years [203]\n\n\nAlumni games\nAlthough Gretzky had previously stated he would not participate in any \"old-timers exhibition games\", [210] on November 22, 2003, he took to the ice to help celebrate the Edmonton Oilers' 25th anniversary as an NHL team The Heritage Classic, held at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton, was the first regular season NHL game to be played outdoors [211] It was preceded by the Mega Stars game, which featured Gretzky and many of his Oiler Dynasty teammates against a group of retired Montreal Canadiens players (whose likes included Claude Lemieux, Guy Lafleur and others) Despite frigid temperatures, the crowd numbered 57,167, with an additional several million watching the game on television [212] The Edmonton alumni won the Megastars game 2–0, [213] while Montreal went on to win the regular season game held later that day, 4–3 [211]\n\n\nEdmonton Oilers\nIn October 2016, Gretzky returned to the Oilers as a partner and vice-chairman of the team's parent company, Oilers Entertainment Group, to work closely with owner Daryl Katz and Oilers Entertainment Group CEO Bob Nicholson on the business side of the Oilers' operation [215]\n\n\nPersonal life\nGretzky has made several TV appearances, including as a Dance Fever celebrity judge, and acted in a dramatic role alongside Victor Newman in The Young and the Restless in 1981 [217] In 1984, he travelled to the Soviet Union to film a television program on Russian goaltender Vladislav Tretiak [218] Gretzky was a guest host of the American late night variety show Saturday Night Live in 1989 [219] A fictional crime-fighting version of him served as one of the main characters in the cartoon ProStars in 1991 [220] In December 2016, Gretzky made a cameo on a Christmas episode of The Simpsons as a winter character [221]\n\n\nFamily\nWhile serving as a judge on Dance Fever, Gretzky met actress Janet Jones [224] According to Gretzky, Jones does not recall his being on the show [224] They met regularly after that, but did not become a couple until 1987 when they ran into each other at a Los Angeles Lakers game [225] Gretzky proposed in January 1988, [226] and they were married on July 16, 1988, in a lavish ceremony the Canadian press dubbed \"The Royal Wedding\" [227] Broadcast live throughout Canada from Edmonton's St Joseph's Basilica, members of the Fire Department acted as ceremonial guards The event reportedly cost Gretzky over US$1 million [228]\n\n\nBusiness ventures\nGretzky owned or partnered in the ownership of two sports teams before becoming a partner in the Phoenix Coyotes In 1985, Gretzky bought the Hull Olympiques of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League for C$175,000 [235] During his ownership, the team's colours were changed to silver and black, presaging the change in team jersey colours when he played for the Los Angeles Kings For the first season that Gretzky played in Los Angeles, the Kings had their training camp at the Olympiques' arena [236] Gretzky sold the team in 1992 for C$550,000 [237]\n\n\nBooks\nGretzky has written several books, including Gretzky: An Autobiography (1990), with Rick Reilly, [262] and 99: My Life in Pictures (1999), with John Davidson and Dan Diamond [263] His most recent work, 99: Stories of the Game (2016), with Kirstie McLellan Day, was an in-depth look at the history of hockey [264] It was the best-selling Canadian book of 2016 [265]\n\n\nPolitical activity\nIn 2003, while not criticizing Canada for declining to participate in the invasion of Iraq, Gretzky praised US President George W Bush and his handling of the conflict, saying: \"the President of the United States is a great leader, I happen to think he's a wonderful man and if he believes what he's doing is right, I back him 100 per cent.\" [266]\n\n\nLegacy\nGretzky's career achievements include a record nine Hart Trophies as the most valuable player in the NHL [277] Between 1981 and 1994, he won the Art Ross Trophy, presented to the NHL's season points leader, 10 times [278] Gretzky was named the MVP of the Stanley Cup playoffs in 1985 and 1988, receiving the Conn Smythe Trophy [279] In addition, he earned the Lester B Pearson Award (now Ted Lindsay Award) on five occasions; the award is given to the NHL's \"most outstanding player\", as determined by National Hockey League Players' Association members [280] The Lady Byng Trophy, awarded for sportsmanship and performance, was presented to Gretzky five times between 1980 and 1999 [281] Gretzky was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1999, and into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2000 He was an inaugural recipient of the Order of Hockey in Canada in 2012 [282]\n\n\nCareer statistics\nFigures in boldface italics are NHL records.\n\n\nRegular season and playoffs\nFigures

player and former executive. He is widely considered the greatest hockey player of all time. Gretzky played major junior and professional hockey for over two decades, playing in the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1979 to 1999. He is the all-time leader in the NHL in goals, assists, and points.\n\n**Early life**\n\nWayne Douglas Gretzky was born on January 26, 1961, in Brantford, Ontario, the son of Phyllis Leone (Hockin) and Walter Gretzky.

assists, 39 points\n* World Championships: 25 goals, 43 assists, 68 points", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Wayne_Gretzky\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nWayne Douglas Gretzky was born on January 26, 1961, in Brantford, Ontario, the son of Phyllis Leone (Hockin) and Walter Gretzky [5] [11] The couple married in 1960, and lived in an apartment in Brantford, where Walter worked for Bell Telephone Canada [12] The family moved into a house on Varadi Avenue in Brantford seven months after Wayne was born, chosen partly because its yard was flat enough to make an ice rink [13] Wayne had a sister, Kim (born 1963), and brothers Keith, Glen and Brent The family regularly visited the farm of Wayne's grandparents, Tony and Mary, and watched Hockey Night in Canada together By age two, Wayne was trying to score goals against Mary using a souvenir stick [14] The farm was where Wayne skated on ice for the first time, aged two years, 10 months [14]\n\n\nWorld Hockey Association\nBy 1978, the World Hockey Association, which had competed with the established NHL since 1972, was struggling The league, which at one point iced fourteen teams, was down to seven surviving franchises The WHA had long sought to arrange a merger with the NHL but were constantly rebuffed by a group of hardline owners in the older league With the WHA's long-term survival in doubt, Birmingham Bulls owner John F Bassett believed the only way to gain meaningful leverage over the NHL was to sign as many young and promising superstars as possible The NHL did not allow the signing of players under age 20, but the WHA had no such rules Bassett saw Gretzky as the most promising young prospect [31] Several WHA teams courted Gretzky, notably the Bulls and the Indianapolis Racers.\n\n\nNHL career\n\nGretzky's success in the WHA carried over into the NHL, despite some critics suggesting he would struggle in what was considered the bigger, tougher, and more talented league [50] \n\nEdmonton Oilers (1979–1988)\n\nGretzky's success in the WHA carried over into the NHL, despite some critics suggesting he would struggle in what was considered the bigger, tougher, and more talented league [50] \n\nThe Gretzky rule\nIn June 1985, as part of a package of five rule changes to be implemented for the 1985–86 season, the NHL Board of Governors decided to introduce offsetting penalties, where neither team lost a man when coincidental penalties were called The effect of calling offsetting penalties was felt immediately in the NHL because during the early 1980s, when the Gretzky-era Oilers entered a four-on-four or three-on-three situation with an opponent, they frequently used the space on the ice to score one or more goals [76] [77] A few days later, during a press conference the day after being awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy, Gretzky criticized the NHL for punishing teams and players who previously benefited The rule change became known as \"the Gretzky rule\" [76] [78] The rule was reversed for the 1992–93 season, by which time a majority of the players from the all-time powerhouse Edmonton Oilers (the 1984–85 Oilers team, the one most directly impacted by the June 1985 rule change, was later voted the greatest NHL team ever, as part of the NHL's centennial celebrations) [79] had changed teams or retired from hockey [80]\n\n\nStrategy and effect on NHL play\nGretzky had a major influence on the style of play of the Edmonton Oilers and the NHL as a whole, helping to inspire a more team-based strategy Using this approach, the Oilers, led by Gretzky, became the highest-scoring team in NHL history [81]\n\n\n\"The Trade\"\nTwo hours after the Oilers won the Stanley Cup in 1988, Gretzky learned from his father that the Oilers were planning to deal him to another team [86] Walter Gretzky had known for months after having been tipped off by Skalbania, but kept the news from Wayne so as not to upset him According to Walter, Wayne was being \"shopped\" to Los Angeles, Detroit, and Vancouver, and Pocklington needed money as his other business ventures were not doing well [87] At first, Gretzky did not want to leave Edmonton, but he received a call while on his honeymoon from Los Angeles Kings owner Bruce McNall, who asked permission to meet and discuss the deal Gretzky informed McNall that his prerequisites for a deal to take place were that Marty McSorley and Mike Krushelnyski join him as teammates in Los Angeles Both McNall and Pocklington quickly agreed After the details of the trade were finalized by the two owners, one final condition had to be met: Gretzky had to call Pocklington and request a trade [88] When Pocklington told Oilers general manager and head coach Sather about his plans to trade Gretzky to Los Angeles, Sather tried to stop the deal, but when he found out that Gretzky had been involved in the negotiations, he changed his attitude and requested Luc Robitaille in exchange The Kings refused, instead offering Jimmy Carson [89]\n\n\nLos Angeles Kings (1988–1996)\nThe Kings named Gretzky their alternate captain He made an immediate impact on the ice, scoring on his first shot on goal in the first regular season game [98] The Kings got off to their best start ever, winning four straight en route to qualifying for the playoffs For only the second time in his NHL career, Gretzky finished second in scoring, but narrowly edged the Pittsburgh Penguins' Mario Lemieux (who scored 199 points) for the Hart Trophy as MVP [99]\n\n\nSt. Louis Blues (1996)\nOn February 27, 1996, Gretzky joined the St Louis Blues in a trade for Patrice Tardif, Roman Vopat, Craig Johnson and two draft picks (Peter Hogan and Matt Zultek) [65] He partially orchestrated the trade after reports surfaced that he was unhappy in Los Angeles [111] At the time of the trade, the Blues and New York Rangers emerged as front-runners, but the Blues met his salary demands [112] Gretzky was immediately named the team's captain He scored 37 points in 31 games for the team in the regular season and the playoffs, [64] and the Blues came within one game of the Conference Finals [113]\n\n\nNew York Rangers (1996–1999)\nGretzky ended his professional playing career with the New York Rangers, where he played his final three seasons and helped the team reach the Eastern Conference Finals in 1997 [116] The Rangers were defeated in the Conference Finals in five games by the Philadelphia Flyers, despite Gretzky leading the Rangers in the playoffs with 10 goals and 10 assists [64] For the first time in his NHL career, Gretzky was not named captain, [117] except for a brief period as acting captain in 1998 when captain Brian Leetch was injured and out of the line-up [118] After the 1996–97 season, Mark Messier signed a free agent contract with the Vancouver Canucks, ending the brief reunion of Messier and Gretzky after just one season [119] The 1997 playoff run was Gretzky's last as a player, and Rangers did not return to the playoffs until 2006, well after Gretzky retired [120] Along with Jaromir Jagr, he topped the NHL in 1997–98 with 67 assists It was the 16th time in 19 seasons that Gretzky earned at least a share of the league lead in the statistic [121]\n\n\nInternational play\nGretzky made his first international appearance as a member of the Canadian national junior team at the 1978 World Junior Championships in Montreal, Quebec The Canadian coach, Punch McLean, was originally skeptical of Gretzky's ability as he was the youngest player to compete in the tournament at the age of 16 [130] [131] He went on to lead the tournament in scoring with 17 points to earn All-Star Team and Best Forward honours [131] His 17 points remain the most scored by a 16-year-old in the World Junior Championships [132] Canada finished with the bronze medal [131] [133]\n\n\nSkills and influences\nGretzky's size and strength were unimpressive—in fact, far below average for the NHL—but he is widely considered the smartest player in the history of the game [142] [143] [144] His reading of the game and his ability to improvise on the fly were unrivaled, and he could consistently anticipate where the puck was going to be and execute the right move at the right time [29] His coach at the Edmonton Oilers, Glen Sather, said, \"He was so much more intelligent While they were using all this energy trying to rattle his teeth, he was just skating away, circling, analyzing things.\" [145]\n\n\nStyle of play\nGretzky's size and strength were unimpressive—in fact, far below average for the NHL—but he is widely considered the smartest player in the history of the game [142] [143] [144] His reading of the game and his ability to improvise on the fly were unrivaled, and he could consistently anticipate where the puck was going to be and execute the right move at the right time [29] His coach at the Edmonton Oilers, Glen Sather, said, \"He was so much more intelligent While they were using all this energy trying to rattle his teeth, he was just skating away, circling, analyzing things.\" [145]\n\n\nPhysical attributes\nWhen he entered the league in 1979, critics opined that Gretzky was \"too small, too wiry, and too slow to be a force in the  [NHL].\" [156] He weighed 160 pounds (73 kg), compared to the NHL average of 189 pounds (86 kg) at that time [157] But that year, Gretzky tied for first place in scoring, and won the Hart Trophy for the league's most valuable player [158] In his second year in the league, weighing just 165 pounds, he broke the previous single-season scoring record, racking up 164 points [159] The next year (1981–82), at 170 pounds—still \"a wisp compared to the average NHL player\"—he set the all-time goal-scoring record, putting 92 pucks in the net [160] He weighed \"about 170 pounds\" for the better part of his career [161] He consistently scored last in strength tests among the Edmonton Oilers, bench pressing only 140 pounds (64 kg) [162]\n\n\nPost-retirement\nGretzky was named honorary chairman of the Open Ice Summit, held in August 1999 to discuss ways to improve Canadian ice hockey [173] He stressed the need to play and practice hockey for the love of the game, [174] and felt that skill was more important to develop than talent and that Canada had the potential to be world leaders in skill development [173]\n\n\nPhoenix Coyotes\nAlmost immediately after retirement, several NHL teams approached Gretzky about an ownership role [186] In May 2000, he agreed to buy a 10% stake in the Phoenix Coyotes in a partnership with majority owner Steve Ellman, taking on the roles of alternate governor, managing partner and head of hockey operations [187] The Coyotes were in the process of being sold and Ellman convinced Gretzky to come on board, averting a potential move to Portland, Oregon [187] The sale was not completed until the following year, on February 15, 2001, after two missed deadlines while securing financing and partners before Ellman and Gretzky could take over Trucking magnate and Arizona Diamondbacks part-owner Jerry Moyes was added to the partnership [188] [189] Gretzky convinced his long-time agent Michael Barnett to join the team as its General Manager [190]\n\n\nWinter Olympics\nGretzky was executive director of the Canadian men's hockey team at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah On February 18, he lashed out at the media at a press conference, frustrated with media and fan comments regarding his team's uninspiring 1–1–1 start [201] His temper boiled over after Canada's 3–3 draw versus the Czech Republic, as he launched a tirade against the perceived negative reputation of Team Canada amongst other national squads, and called rumours of dissent in the dressing room the result of \"American propaganda\" \"They're loving us not doing well\", he said, referring to American hockey fans [201] American fans online began calling Gretzky a \"crybaby\"; defenders said he was merely borrowing a page from former coach Glen Sather to take the pressure off his players Gretzky addressed those comments by saying he spoke out to protect the Canadian players, and the tirade was not \"staged\" [202] The Canadian team won the gold medal, its first in 50 years [203]\n\n\nAlumni games\nAlthough Gretzky had previously stated he would not participate in any \"old-timers exhibition games\", [210] on November 22, 2003, he took to the ice to help celebrate the Edmonton Oilers' 25th anniversary as an NHL team The Heritage Classic, held at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton, was the first regular season NHL game to be played outdoors [211] It was preceded by the Mega Stars game, which featured Gretzky and many of his Oiler Dynasty teammates against a group of retired Montreal Canadiens players (whose likes included Claude Lemieux, Guy Lafleur and others) Despite frigid temperatures, the crowd numbered 57,167, with an additional several million watching the game on television [212] The Edmonton alumni won the Megastars game 2–0, [213] while Montreal went on to win the regular season game held later that day, 4–3 [211]\n\n\nEdmonton Oilers\nIn October 2016, Gretzky returned to the Oilers as a partner and vice-chairman of the team's parent company, Oilers Entertainment Group, to work closely with owner Daryl Katz and Oilers Entertainment Group CEO Bob Nicholson on the business side of the Oilers' operation [215]\n\n\nPersonal life\nGretzky has made several TV appearances, including as a Dance Fever celebrity judge, and acted in a dramatic role alongside Victor Newman in The Young and the Restless in 1981 [217] In 1984, he travelled to the Soviet Union to film a television program on Russian goaltender Vladislav Tretiak [218] Gretzky was a guest host of the American late night variety show Saturday Night Live in 1989 [219] A fictional crime-fighting version of him served as one of the main characters in the cartoon ProStars in 1991 [220] In December 2016, Gretzky made a cameo on a Christmas episode of The Simpsons as a winter character [221]\n\n\nFamily\nWhile serving as a judge on Dance Fever, Gretzky met actress Janet Jones [224] According to Gretzky, Jones does not recall his being on the show [224] They met regularly after that, but did not become a couple until 1987 when they ran into each other at a Los Angeles Lakers game [225] Gretzky proposed in January 1988, [226] and they were married on July 16, 1988, in a lavish ceremony the Canadian press dubbed \"The Royal Wedding\" [227] Broadcast live throughout Canada from Edmonton's St Joseph's Basilica, members of the Fire Department acted as ceremonial guards The event reportedly cost Gretzky over US$1 million [228]\n\n\nBusiness ventures\nGretzky owned or partnered in the ownership of two sports teams before becoming a partner in the Phoenix Coyotes In 1985, Gretzky bought the Hull Olympiques of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League for C$175,000 [235] During his ownership, the team's colours were changed to silver and black, presaging the change in team jersey colours when he played for the Los Angeles Kings For the first season that Gretzky played in Los Angeles, the Kings had their training camp at the Olympiques' arena [236] Gretzky sold the team in 1992 for C$550,000 [237]\n\n\nBooks\nGretzky has written several books, including Gretzky: An Autobiography (1990), with Rick Reilly, [262] and 99: My Life in Pictures (1999), with John Davidson and Dan Diamond [263] His most recent work, 99: Stories of the Game (2016), with Kirstie McLellan Day, was an in-depth look at the history of hockey [264] It was the best-selling Canadian book of 2016 [265]\n\n\nPolitical activity\nIn 2003, while not criticizing Canada for declining to participate in the invasion of Iraq, Gretzky praised US President George W Bush and his handling of the conflict, saying: \"the President of the United States is a great leader, I happen to think he's a wonderful man and if he believes what he's doing is right, I back him 100 per cent.\" [266]\n\n\nLegacy\nGretzky's career achievements include a record nine Hart Trophies as the most valuable player in the NHL [277] Between 1981 and 1994, he won the Art Ross Trophy, presented to the NHL's season points leader, 10 times [278] Gretzky was named the MVP of the Stanley Cup playoffs in 1985 and 1988, receiving the Conn Smythe Trophy [279] In addition, he earned the Lester B Pearson Award (now Ted Lindsay Award) on five occasions; the award is given to the NHL's \"most outstanding player\", as determined by National Hockey League Players' Association members [280] The Lady Byng Trophy, awarded for sportsmanship and performance, was presented to Gretzky five times between 1980 and 1999 [281] Gretzky was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1999, and into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2000 He was an inaugural recipient of the Order of Hockey in Canada in 2012 [282]\n\n\nCareer statistics\nFigures in boldface italics are NHL records.\n\n\nRegular season and playoffs\nFigures

Born on 24 April 1959, in Colwyn Bay, Wales, to English parents, Yates was brought up in a show business family.\n\n## Early Life\nYates was born to Elaine Smith, a performer who used the stage name Heller Toren, and her husband, Jess Yates, a television presenter. However, in 1997, a DNA test revealed that Yates' biological father was actually Hughie Green, a game show host. Jess Yates and Elaine Smith were married from 1958 to 1975, during which time Elaine was 19 years younger than her husband.\n\n## Career\nYates began her career in the late 1970s as a music journalist, writing for the Record Mirror under the pseudonym \"Natural Blonde\". She also posed for Penthouse magazine in 1979. In the 1980s, Yates gained prominence as a television presenter, co-hosting the Channel 4 pop music programme \"The Tube\" alongside Jools Holland.\n\nYates also appeared in various other television shows, including BBC chat shows with presenter Terry Wogan. In 1987, she appeared alongside her friend Jennifer Saunders in a spoof documentary about the pop group Bananarama.\n\n## Personal Life\nYates met Bob Geldof, the lead singer of the Boomtown Rats, in the early days of the band. They began a romantic relationship in 1976, with Yates flying to Paris to surprise Geldof when the band was playing there. The couple's first daughter, Fifi, was born in 1983. After ten years together, Yates and Geldof married on 31 August 1986 in Las Vegas, with Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran serving as best man.\n\nThe couple had two more daughters, Peaches, born on 13 March 1989, and Pixie, born on 17 September 1990.\n\n## Death\nOn 17 September 2000, on Pixie's 10th birthday, Yates died at her home in Notting Hill, London, at the age of 41. The cause of death was determined to be a heroin overdose. The coroner ruled that it was not a suicide, but rather a result of \"foolish and incautious\" behavior.\n\nYates was discovered in the presence of her then-four-year-old daughter, Tiger Lily. A friend disclosed during the inquest that Yates had not taken illegal drugs for nearly two years, and the coroner concluded that although the amount Yates had taken would not have killed an addict, \"an unsophisticated taker of heroin\" like Yates had no tolerance to the drug.\n\n## Legacy\nOn 14 March 2023, a two-part Channel 4 documentary, entitled \"Paula\", was released, which explored Yates' life and career. The documentary featured interviews with Yates' friends, including Belinda Brewin, Nicky Clarke, Robbie Williams, Vanessa Feltz, and Grace Dent, as well as archive footage and previously unheard recorded interviews.\n\nThe documentary highlighted the intense media attention surrounding Yates and the often-negative coverage in the British press.

player, born on 31 May 2001 in Warsaw, Poland. She is the daughter of Dorota and Tomasz Świątek, and has a sister, Agata, who is a dentist. Iga's father is a former rower who competed in the men's quadruple sculls event at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.\n\n## Early life and background\nŚwiątek has a younger sister, Agata, who is a dentist. Her father, Tomasz Świątek, was a rower and competed in the men's quadruple sculls event at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Her mother, Dorota Świątek, is an orthodontist.\n\n## Junior career\nŚwiątek began competing in ITF Junior Circuit events in 2015 and won back-to-back low-level Grade 4 titles in April and May at age 13. She moved up to Grade 2 events that year and finished runner-up in both singles and doubles at the Czech Junior Open. In 2016, Świątek made her junior Grand Slam tournament debut at the French Open and reached the quarterfinals in both singles and doubles.\n\n## Professional career\nŚwiątek began competing on the ITF Women's Circuit in 2016 and played on the circuit through the end of 2018. She won all seven ITF singles finals she reached, ranging from the first four at the $10k to $15k level to one at the $25k level, followed by two at the $60k level. Her first three titles came at 15 years old. In 2018, Świątek won a $60k title at the NEK Ladies Open and another at the Montreux Ladies Open. These titles earned her entry into the top 200 for the first time, rising from No 298 to No 180 in two weeks.\n\n## 2019: First WTA Tour final, top 50\nDespite never playing on the WTA Tour before 2019, Świątek competed in only tour-level events throughout the year. In the Australian Open, she defeated No 82 Ana Bogdan in the second round to reach the third round. A month later, she qualified for the Hungarian Ladies Open and defeated No 53 Katerina Kozlova in the first round but lost to No 14 Belinda Bencic in the second round.

She reached the fourth round where she lost to Simona Halep in straight sets. At Adelaide, Świątek won her first WTA Tour title without dropping a set, defeating Belinda Bencic in the final. As a result, Świątek entered the top 15 for the first time in her career, rising from No 18 to No 13. At the French Open, Świątek lost to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the third round.\n\n## 2022: World No 1, 37-match winning streak\nŚwiątek began her season by reaching the semifinals at the Adelaide International. She then reached another semifinal at the Australian Open. Following a second-round loss to Jeļena Ostapenko, Świątek won the next six tournaments she entered – Qatar Ladies Open, Indian Wells Open, Miami Open, Stuttgart Open, Italian Open, and French Open. Świątek became the fourth woman to complete the Sunshine Double and reached the world No 1 singles ranking, becoming the youngest player to achieve this feat. She accumulated a 37-match winning streak, the longest in the 21st century.\n\n## 2023: French and WTA Finals champion, No 1\nŚwiątek's 2023 campaign was less dominant than her 2022 season but she still managed to win six titles. She started 2023 as the fourth woman in WTA history to be ranked world No 1 for 40 or more consecutive weeks in their first stint as the top-ranked player. At the Australian Open, Świątek lost in the fourth round in straight sets to Elena Rybakina, who would go on to defeat her twice more later in the year.\n\n## National representation\nŚwiątek represented Poland at the ITF World Junior Tennis Finals for 14-and-under girls in 2014 and 2015.

Their 2024 Madrid Open final was particularly notable, as Świątek came back from a set down to win in three sets.\n\n## Playing style\nŚwiątek has an aggressive playing style that incorporates a lot of variety. She has a strong serve and hits a lot of topspin groundstrokes.

French Open that year, she hit 175 winners to 127 unforced errors The basis of Świątek's game was described by tennis journalist Christopher Clarey for The New York Times as: her sliding ability,

strength forged through sports psychology [146]\n\n\nBagels\nŚwiątek's tendency to bagel or breadstick her opponents has led to the term \"Iga's Bakery\" entering tennis parlance [160] [161]

said After winning in at the French Open in 2020, Świątek revealed that using her sports psychologist, Daria Abramowicz, had helped her get over the line \"It's just good to stay open-minded If you need that kind of help, then go for it If you're up to it and if you're open-minded, I think it helps a lot,\" Świątek added [200]\n\n\nSupport of Ukraine\nFollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine in

the English village fête, the series is filmed in bunting-draped marquees in scenic gardens [12] In the first series, the filming locations varied in different episodes, but only one location was used for each series from the second series onwards The series is normally filmed over a 12 to 13 weeks period, and the filming usually takes place over the weekends with the exception of series 11 when filming was shortened to six weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic [13]\n\n\nBroadcast and personnel changes\nOn 17 August 2010, the first episode of The Great British Bake Off was shown on BBC Two [17]

most-watched programme on British television in 2015 and 2016 [18] [19] Following extended negotiations, Love Productions announced that the seventh series of the show would be the last broadcast by the BBC On 12 September 2016, Love agreed to a three-year deal to broadcast the show on Channel 4 [1] Despite the move, BBC Studios retains global distribution and format rights to the series except in North America [20] and are set for renewal in 2028 [21]\n\n\nFormat\nThe programme operates on a weekly elimination process to find the best all-around baker from the contestants, who are all

UK, with the final round being held at Fulham Palace, London.\n\n\nSeries 2 (2011)\nThe number of amateur baker contestants increased to twelve for the second series Unlike Series 1, this year The

on what a baker presents, notably:\n\n\nThe Great Christmas/Festive Bake Off\nSince 2016, two-holiday specials have been transmitted between each series The special will typically feature four returning bakers from the previous series (six in the first 2023 special and the second 2024 special) to compete in three holiday-themed challenges (excluding the second 2019 special which featured the cast of the sitcom Derry Girls, the first 2021 special which featured the cast of the drama It's a Sin, the first 2022 special which featured Channel 4 legends to commemorate the channel's 40th anniversary, and the first 2024 special which featured soap opera stars) Since 2017 (following the move from BBC), one special is broadcast on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day and the other on New Year's Day on Channel 4 [61]\n\n\nReception\nThe early reviews for the first series were mixed Lucy Mangan of The Guardian wondered if \"competitive baking  [is] a contradiction in terms\" and found the proceedings humourless [62] Iain Hollingshead of The Daily Telegraph was scathing, describing the presenters as \"annoying\", the judge Paul Hollywood as looking \"sinister without being interesting\", and that the audience would be so bored that they \"could certainly forgive the cameraman if he were to commit  hara-kiri in a giant pool of egg and flour.\" [63]\n\n\nCritical reception\nThe early reviews for the first series were mixed Lucy Mangan of The Guardian wondered if \"competitive baking  [is] a contradiction in terms\" and found the proceedings humourless [62] Iain Hollingshead of The Daily Telegraph was scathing, describing the presenters as \"annoying\", the judge Paul Hollywood as looking \"sinister without being interesting\", and that the audience would be so bored that they \"could certainly forgive the cameraman if he were to commit  hara-kiri in a giant pool of egg and flour.\" [63]\n\n\nCultural impact\nBake Off is credited with spurring an interest in home baking, with supermarkets and department stores in the UK reporting sharp rises in sales of baking ingredients and accessories [3] The show is also credited with reviving Women's Institutes, whose membership reached its highest level since the 1970s [75] Between 2010 and 2013, the Bake Off effect had seen membership grow by a quarter to over 211,000 [76] It was the largest impact on membership since the release of the 2003 British comedy film Calendar Girls, starring Helen Mirren and Julie Walters, where a group of middle-aged Yorkshire women produced a nude calendar to raise money for Leukaemia Research under the auspices of the Women's Institutes [76] Ruth Bond, chairwoman of the National Federation of Women's Institutes, said Bake Off has inspired women to take up baking by 'taking away the fear factor' and making it look fun [76] The show also boosted the sales of bakery books and the number of baking clubs, and independent bakeries also showed an increase According to one analyst, more than three-fifths of adults baked at home at least once in 2013 compared with only a third in 2011 [77]\n\n\nTV ratings\nThe first series of The Great British Bake Off premiered in August 2010 with moderate ratings of just over 2 million viewers for its first episode [79] This was enough to place it in BBC Two's top ten for that week, and over the series the audience grew to over 3 million, with the semi-final and final both achieving first place in BBC Two's weekly ratings During the second series, the ratings gradually increased, and it became a surprise hit with nearly 4 million watching each episode [80] Week two was the last time that the show was out-rated by another BBC Two programme in the same week (it came second to the drama Page Eight); from then until the show's move to BBC One, every competition episode would be the channel's number one rated programme of the week By its final episode it had averaged 4.56 million viewers, peaking at 5.1 million in its last 15 minutes [81]\n\n\nControversies\nIn September 2012, production company Love Productions was sanctioned by the BBC for product placement of Smeg fridges The issue came to light after a viewer wrote to the Radio Times complaining of \"blatant product promotion\" After an investigation, the BBC said Love Production's loan agreement with Smeg did not meet editorial guidelines and was being revised for the third series, and that appropriate retrospective hire payments would be made [100] The BBC asked Smeg to remove a notice from its website promoting its association with the show, which it did [101]\n\n\nProduct placement sanction\nIn September 2012, production company Love Productions was sanctioned by the BBC for product placement of Smeg fridges The issue came to light after a viewer wrote to the Radio Times complaining of \"blatant product promotion\" After an investigation, the BBC said Love Production's loan agreement with Smeg did not meet editorial guidelines and was being revised for the third series, and that appropriate retrospective hire payments would be made [100] The BBC asked Smeg to remove a notice from its website promoting its association with the show, which it did [101]\n\n\nFavouritism\nDuring the fourth series allegations arose regarding Paul Hollywood's favouritism toward Ruby Tandoh, [102] resulting in personal attacks against Tandoh including by the chef Raymond Blanc who derided her for being thin and at times crying, which he called “female tears” [103]Tandoh subsequently defended herself with an article in The Guardian and reflected on the anger and misogyny in online commentary about the show [104] [105] Both Hollywood and Tandoh denied the accusation [106]\nLate in the ninth series, allegations of judges' favouritism toward Rahul Mandal arose among a small group of fans loyal to Kim-Joy,  [107] after judges gave Mandal compensatory time to complete his task A shattered glass jug forced Mandal to stop and rendered his bake in progress unsafe The producers awarded Mandal the time (15 minutes) he lost while his station was cleaned, after which he started his bake again from the beginning.\n\n\nBaked Alaska controversy (\"Bingate\")\nIn the fourth episode of the fifth series, there was controversy around the elimination of contestant Iain Watters During the final showstopper round contestants were tasked with producing a Baked Alaska Iain's ice cream was shown as having not set and in a show of frustration he threw his bake in the bin The editing of the show suggested that another contestant, Diana Beard, had caused the failure by removing the ice cream from a freezer, and the perceived \"sabotage\" resulted in an uproar on social media networks [108] However, unseen footage broadcast in the accompanying programme An Extra Slice shows Luis holding the large floor freezer that contained Iain's ice cream open as he piped the sides of his own baked Alaska, while Mel warns him to pipe quickly and close the freezer  Later in the episode, when Iain removes his ice cream to begin the next step of his dish, it is still quite soft, indicating it went into the freezer he shared with Diana without being completely frozen  Various members of the cast posted comments in support of Diana [109] and a BBC spokesman later issued a statement that \"Diana removing Iain's ice cream from the freezer for less than a minute was in no way responsible for Iain's departure.\" [110]\n\n\nUse of innuendo\nA number of viewers complained to the BBC feedback show Points of View in the fifth series about the \"constant smutty remarks\" from the presenters Mel and Sue [112] [113] This series was seen as having more innuendos than previous ones; some reviewers noted the \"extra pinch of saucy spice\" and \"the increasingly filthy-minded hosts Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins\" [114] [115] However, the series 3 winner John Whaite argued that innuendo is part of what made the show a success, [116] whilst judge Paul Hollywood described the innuendos as banter in the spirit of the Carry On films and a part of British culture, [117] a view shared by others [118] [119]\n\n\nClones, legal challenges and move to Channel 4\nThe success of The Great British Bake Off led to the BBC commissioning many other series closely following the format from Love Productions for example The Great British Sewing Bee and The Great Pottery Throw Down However, when the 2014 series Hair using the same format was produced in house by the BBC, Love Productions responded by making preparations to sue the BBC for infringing their copyright [120] [121] Although the matter was kept quiet, with the BBC settling out of court and compensating Love Productions, [120] [121] the matter soured relations between the BBC and Love Productions [121] In September 2016, it was announced that the BBC had lost the broadcast rights of the show to Channel 4 [122] Channel 4 offered £25 million for the show outbidding the £15 million offered by the BBC [122] In January 2017 the BBC waived its rights to keep the programme off the air until 2018, and wished it \"well for the future\" [123]\n\n\nAccidental revelation of Series 8 winner\nOn 31 October 2017, judge Prue Leith accidentally revealed that Sophie Faldo was the winner of Series 8 on her Twitter account, twelve hours before the finale was due to air This caused uproar among many fans of the show She quickly deleted the tweet and apologised to the fans who saw it [124] The first episode of Series 9 poked fun at the incident by having hosts Toksvig and Fielding dress as Marty McFly and Doc Brown from Back to the Future and travel back in time via a DeLorean time machine to stop Leith from tweeting out the season's winner [125]\n\n\nNationally-themed weeks\nRecent series have included weeks themed around a designated country, many of which have been criticised for their use of inauthentic dishes, fostering of stereotypes and \"casual\" racism.\n\n\nAwards and nominations\nThe Great British Bake Off has been nominated a number of times in various categories for the BAFTA awards and won in 2012, 2013, and 2016 [135] [136] The programme was nominated for a Rose d'Or in the Lifestyle section of the 2012 competition and won [137] [138] It also won two 2015 National Television Award for Skills

nude calendar to raise money for Leukaemia Research under the auspices of the Women's Institutes [76] Ruth Bond, chairwoman of the National Federation of Women's Institutes, said Bake Off has inspired women to take up baking by 'taking away the fear factor' and making it look fun [76] The show also boosted the sales of bakery books and the number of baking clubs, and independent bakeries also showed an increase According to one analyst, more than three-fifths of adults baked at home at least once in 2013 compared with only a third in 2011 [77]\n\n\nTV ratings\nThe first series of The Great British Bake Off premiered in August 2010 with moderate ratings of just over 2 million viewers for its first episode [79] This was enough to place it in BBC Two's top ten for that week, and over the series the audience grew to over 3 million, with the semi-final and final both achieving first place in BBC Two's weekly ratings During the second series, the ratings gradually increased, and it became a surprise hit with nearly 4 million watching each episode [80] Week two was the last time that the show was out-rated by another BBC Two programme in the same week (it came second to the drama Page Eight); from then until the show's move to BBC One, every competition episode would be the channel's number one rated programme of the week By its final episode it had averaged 4.56 million viewers, peaking at 5.1 million in its last 15 minutes [81]\n\n\nControversies\nIn September 2012, production company Love Productions was sanctioned by the BBC for product placement of Smeg fridges The issue came to light after a viewer wrote to the Radio Times complaining of \"blatant product promotion\" After an investigation, the BBC said Love Production's loan agreement with Smeg did not meet editorial guidelines and was being revised for the third series, and that appropriate retrospective hire payments would be made [100] The BBC asked Smeg to remove a notice from its website promoting its association with the show, which it did [101]\n\n\nProduct placement sanction\nIn September 2012, production company Love Productions was sanctioned by the BBC for product placement of

website promoting its association with the show, which it did [101]\n\n\nFavouritism\nDuring the fourth series allegations arose regarding Paul Hollywood's favouritism toward Ruby Tandoh, [102] resulting in personal attacks against Tandoh including by the chef Raymond Blanc who derided her for being thin and at times crying, which he called “female tears” [103]Tandoh subsequently defended herself with an article in The Guardian and reflected on the anger and misogyny in online commentary about the show [104] [105] Both Hollywood and Tandoh denied the accusation [106]\nLate in the ninth series, allegations of judges' favouritism toward Rahul Mandal arose among a small group of fans loyal to Kim-Joy,  [107] after judges gave Mandal compensatory time to complete his task A shattered glass jug forced Mandal to stop and rendered his bake in progress unsafe The producers awarded Mandal the time (15 minutes) he lost while his station was cleaned, after which he started his bake again from the beginning.\n\n\nBaked Alaska controversy (\"Bingate\")\nIn the fourth episode of the fifth series, there was controversy around the elimination of contestant Iain Watters During the final showstopper round contestants were tasked with producing a Baked Alaska Iain's ice cream was shown as having not set and in a show of frustration he threw his bake in the bin The editing of the show suggested that another contestant, Diana Beard, had caused the failure by removing the ice cream from a freezer, and the perceived \"sabotage\" resulted in an uproar on social media networks [108] However, unseen footage broadcast in the accompanying programme An Extra Slice shows Luis holding the large floor freezer that contained Iain's ice cream open as he piped the sides of his own baked Alaska, while Mel warns him to pipe quickly and close the freezer  Later in the episode, when Iain removes his ice cream to begin the next step of his dish, it is still quite soft, indicating it went into the freezer he shared with Diana without being completely frozen  Various members of the cast posted comments in support of Diana [109] and a BBC spokesman later issued a statement that \"Diana removing Iain's ice cream from the freezer for less than a minute was in no way responsible for Iain's departure.\" [110]\n\n\nUse of innuendo\nA number of viewers complained to the BBC feedback show Points of View in the fifth series about the \"constant smutty remarks\" from the presenters Mel and Sue [112] [113] This series was seen as having more innuendos than previous ones; some reviewers noted the \"extra pinch of saucy spice\" and \"the increasingly filthy-minded hosts Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins\" [114] [115] However, the series 3 winner John Whaite argued that innuendo is part of what made the show a success, [116] whilst judge Paul Hollywood described the innuendos as banter in the spirit of the Carry On films and a part of British culture, [117] a view shared by others [118] [119]\n\n\nClones, legal challenges and move to Channel 4\nThe success of The Great British Bake Off led to the BBC commissioning many other series closely following the format from Love Productions for example The Great British Sewing Bee and The Great Pottery Throw Down However, when the 2014 series Hair using the same format was produced in house by the BBC, Love Productions responded by making preparations to sue the BBC for infringing their copyright [120] [121] Although the matter was kept quiet, with the BBC settling out of court and compensating Love Productions, [120] [121] the matter soured relations between the BBC and Love Productions [121] In September 2016, it was announced that the BBC had lost the broadcast rights of the show to Channel 4 [122] Channel 4 offered £25 million for the show outbidding the £15 million offered by the BBC [122] In January 2017 the BBC waived its rights to keep the programme off the air until 2018, and wished it \"well for the future\" [123]\n\n\nAccidental revelation of Series 8 winner\nOn 31 October 2017, judge Prue Leith accidentally revealed that Sophie Faldo was the winner of Series 8 on her Twitter account, twelve hours before the finale was due to air This caused uproar among many fans of the show She quickly deleted the tweet and apologised to the fans who saw it [124] The first episode of Series 9 poked fun at the incident by having hosts Toksvig and Fielding dress as Marty McFly and Doc Brown from Back to the Future and travel back in time via a DeLorean time machine to stop Leith from tweeting out the season's winner [125]\n\n\nNationally-themed weeks\nRecent series have included weeks themed around a designated country, many of which have been criticised for their use of inauthentic dishes, fostering of stereotypes and \"casual\" racism.\n\n\nAwards and nominations\nThe Great British Bake Off has been nominated a number of times in various categories for the BAFTA awards and won in 2012, 2013, and 2016 [135] [136] The programme was nominated for a Rose d'Or in the Lifestyle section of the 2012 competition and won [137] [138] It also won two 2015 National Television Award for Skills
