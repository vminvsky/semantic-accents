the Barcelona squad [52]\n\n\nRecent issues\nDuring the last decades, the rivalry has been augmented by the modern Spanish tradition of the pasillo, where one team is given the guard of honor by the other team, once the former clinches the La Liga trophy before El Clásico takes place This has happened in three occasions First, during El Clásico that took place on 30 April 1988, where Real Madrid won the championship on the previous round Then, three years later, when Barcelona won the championship two rounds before El Clásico on 8 June 1991 [57] The last pasillo, and most recent, took place on 7 May 2008, and this time Real Madrid had won the championship [58] In May 2018, Real Madrid refused to perform pasillo to Barcelona even though the latter had already wrapped up the championship a round prior to their meeting [59] Real Madrid's coach at the time, Zinedine Zidane, reasoned that Barcelona also refused to perform it five months earlier, on 23 December 2017, when Real Madrid were the FIFA Club World Cup champions [60]\n\n\nPlayer rivalries\nUntil the early 1950s, Real Madrid was not a regular title contender in Spain, having won only two Primera División titles between 1929 and 1953 [73] However, things changed for Real after the arrival of Alfredo Di Stéfano in 1953, Paco Gento in the same year, Raymond Kopa in 1956, and Ferenc Puskás in 1958 Real Madrid's strength increased in this period until the team dominated Spain and Europe, while Barcelona relied on its Hungarian star László Kubala and Luis Suárez, who joined in 1955 in addition to the Hungarian players Sándor Kocsis and Zoltán Czibor and the Brazilian Evaristo With the arrival of Kubala and Di Stéfano, Barcelona and Real Madrid became among the most important European clubs in those years, and the players represented the turning point in the history of their teams [74] [75] [76]\n\n\nLászló Kubala and Alfredo Di Stéfano (1953–1961)\nUntil the early 1950s, Real Madrid was not a regular title

(2009–2018)\nThe rivalry between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo between 2009 and 2018 has been the most competitive in El Clásico history, with both players being their clubs' all-time top scorers In their period, many records were broken for both clubs; the two players alternated as top scorers in La Liga and the Champions League during most seasons while they were with Real Madrid and Barcelona [78] During this period, Ronaldo won the European Golden Shoe three times and Messi five times [79] In addition, Messi won the Ballon d'Or five times and Ronaldo four times

The rivalry between the two clubs is considered one of the fiercest in the world of football, with a rich history and intense competition on and off the field.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe rivalry between Barcelona and Real Madrid has been ongoing for over a century, with the two clubs having a long and complex history that dates back to the early 20th century. The rivalry has been fueled by the intense competition between the two clubs on the field, as well as their different cultural and social backgrounds. Barcelona is a club from the Catalonia region, while Real Madrid is based in the Spanish capital, Madrid.\n\n## History\n\nThe first match between Barcelona and Real Madrid took place in 1928, with Real Madrid winning 3-1. The rivalry between the two clubs quickly gained momentum, with both teams competing for the same titles and glory. Over the years, the rivalry has been marked by several notable matches and events, including the 1975 Copa del Rey final, which Barcelona won 4-0, and the 1997 El Clásico match, which Real Madrid won 2-1.\n\n## 1943 Copa del Generalísimo Semi-finals\n\nThe rivalry between Barcelona and Real Madrid intensified in the 1940s, with the two clubs clashing in the 1943 Copa del Generalísimo semi-finals. The second leg of the match, played at the Chamartín in Madrid, ended in a 3-0 victory for Real Madrid, with Barcelona winning the first leg 3-0 at the Les Corts in Catalonia. However, Real Madrid's victory in the second leg sparked controversy, with the referee, Fombona Fernández, allowing three goals that were deemed unfair by the Barcelona players and fans.\n\n## Di Stéfano Transfer\n\nThe rivalry between Barcelona and Real Madrid was further intensified in the 1950s, when the clubs disputed the signing of Argentine forward Alfredo Di Stéfano. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millionarios in Bogotá, Colombia, during a players' strike in his native Argentina. Real Madrid eventually signed Di Stéfano in 1953, with the player going on to become a key figure in the club's success.\n\n## Recent Issues\n\nIn recent years, the rivalry between Barcelona and Real Madrid has been marked by several notable incidents, including the 2000 El Clásico match, which Real Madrid won 3-0, and the 2008 El Clásico match, which Barcelona won 6-2. The rivalry has also been fueled by the intense competition for the La Liga title, with both clubs vying for the championship.\n\n## Player Rivalries\n\nOne of the most notable player rivalries in El Clásico is between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, who played for Barcelona and Real Madrid, respectively, from 2009 to 2018. The two players are widely regarded as two of the greatest players of all time, and their rivalry was marked by several intense matches and goalscoring duels.\n\n## Statistics\n\n* 24 players have scored a hat-trick in official El Clásico matches.\n* Real Madrid leads Barcelona 105 to 99 in terms of official overall trophies, including the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League.\n* The most consecutive wins in El Clásico is 12, achieved by Real Madrid between 2016 and 2019.\n\n## Goalkeeping\n\n* The most clean sheets in El Clásico is 17, achieved by Iker Casillas of Real Madrid between 2005 and 2013.\n* The longest run of consecutive clean sheets in El Clásico is 5, achieved by Casillas in 2007.\n\n## Assists\n\n* The most assists in El Clásico is 12, achieved by Lionel Messi of Barcelona between 2009 and 2018.\n* The most consecutive assists in El Clásico is 5, achieved by Messi in 2011.\n\n## Disciplinary\n\n* The most red cards in El Clásico is 7, achieved by Ricardo Carvalho of Real Madrid between 2002 and 2006.\n* The most yellow cards in El Clásico is 23, achieved by Carles Puyol of Barcelona between 2002 and 2012.\n\n## Other Records\n\n* The highest attendance in El Clásico is 96,000, achieved at the Santiago Bernabéu in 2010.\n* The highest aggregate score in El Clásico is 13-6, achieved in the 2013-14 La Liga season.\n\n## Managers\n\nOnly two coaches have been at the helm of both clubs: Miguel Muñoz and José Antonio Camacho.\n\n## Personnel at Both Clubs\n\nOnly two players have played for both clubs: Álvaro Arbeloa and Miguel Torruco.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Barcelona F.C.\n* Real Madrid F.C.\n* La Liga\n* Copa del Rey\n* UEFA Champions League\n\nNote: This article is a general overview of the El Clásico rivalry.

attack the representatives of Spain.\" [37] Barcelona player Josep Valle recalled: \"The press officer at the DND and ABC newspaper wrote all sorts of scurrilous lies, really terrible things, winding up the Madrid fans like never before\" Former Real Madrid goalkeeper Eduardo Teus, who admitted that Madrid had \"above all played hard\", wrote in a newspaper: \"the ground itself made Madrid concede two of the three goals, goals that were totally unfair\" [38]\n\n\nDi Stéfano transfer\nThe rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Argentine forward Alfredo Di Stéfano Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millionarios in Bogotá, Colombia, during a players' strike in his native Argentina Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di Stéfano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira ($200,000 according to other sources [specify]) This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights [45] FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953–54 and 1955–56 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954–55 and 1956–57 seasons in Barcelona [46] [47] The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953 Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to Los Blancos, signing a four-year contract Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, [failed verification] an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club [47]\n\n\nFinal of the bottles\nOn 11 July 1968, Barcelona beat Real Madrid 1–0 in the Copa del Generalísimo final at the Santiago Bernabéu Real Madrid fans, angry about the refereeing, started throwing bottles at the referee and Barcelona players in the last minutes of the match [49] Antonio Rigo, the referee of the final, was accused of favouring Barcelona [49] Regarding the two not awarded penalties, he said \"I didn't see a penalty on Amancio, and Serena tripped He wanted to deceive me by diving when he entered the penalty area.\" He also accused the Real Madrid manager of trying to bribe him with a pre-match gift [49] General Franco presented the trophy to Barcelona with a pitch full of bottles, hence the name [50] [51]\n\n\nLuís Figo transfer\nIn 2000, Real Madrid's then-presidential candidate, Florentino Pérez, offered Barcelona's vice-captain Luís Figo $2.4 million to sign an agreement binding him to Madrid if he won the elections If Figo broke the deal, he would have to pay Pérez $30 million in compensation When his agent confirmed the deal, Figo denied everything, insisting, \"I'll stay at Barcelona whether Pérez wins or loses.\" He accused the presidential candidate of \"lying\" and \"fantasizing\" He told Barcelona teammates Luis Enrique and Pep Guardiola he was not leaving and they conveyed the message to the Barcelona squad [52]\n\n\nRecent issues\nDuring the last decades, the rivalry has been augmented by the modern Spanish tradition of the pasillo, where one team is given the guard of honor by the other team, once the former clinches the La Liga trophy before El Clásico takes place This has happened in three occasions First, during El Clásico that took place on 30 April 1988, where Real Madrid won the championship on the previous round Then, three years later, when Barcelona won the championship two rounds before El Clásico on 8 June 1991 [57] The last pasillo, and most recent, took place on 7 May 2008, and this time Real Madrid had won the championship [58] In May 2018, Real Madrid refused to perform pasillo to Barcelona even though the latter had already wrapped up the championship a round prior to their meeting [59] Real Madrid's coach at the time, Zinedine Zidane, reasoned that Barcelona also refused to perform it five months earlier, on 23 December 2017, when Real Madrid were the FIFA Club World Cup champions [60]\n\n\nPlayer rivalries\nUntil the early 1950s, Real Madrid was not a regular title contender in Spain, having won only two Primera División titles between 1929 and 1953 [73] However, things changed for Real after the arrival of Alfredo Di Stéfano in 1953, Paco Gento in the same year, Raymond Kopa in 1956, and Ferenc Puskás in 1958 Real Madrid's strength increased in this period until the team dominated Spain and Europe, while Barcelona relied on its Hungarian star László Kubala and Luis Suárez, who joined in 1955 in addition to the Hungarian players Sándor Kocsis and Zoltán Czibor and the Brazilian Evaristo With the arrival of Kubala and Di Stéfano, Barcelona and Real Madrid became among the most important European clubs in those years, and the players represented the turning point in the history of their teams [74] [75] [76]\n\n\nLászló Kubala and Alfredo Di Stéfano (1953–1961)\nUntil the early 1950s, Real Madrid was not a regular title

(2009–2018)\nThe rivalry between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo between 2009 and 2018 has been the most competitive in El Clásico history, with both players being their clubs' all-time top scorers

Barcelona [78] During this period, Ronaldo won the European Golden Shoe three times and Messi five times [79] In addition, Messi won the Ballon d'Or five times and Ronaldo four times

taught himself to sew In 1974, Baker met Harvey Milk, an influential gay leader, who later challenged Baker to devise a symbol of pride for the gay community [7] The inspiration for the original gay

Baker, born in 1951 and raised in Parsons, Kansas, had served in the U.S Army between 1970 and 1972 After an honorable discharge, Baker taught himself to sew In 1974, Baker met Harvey Milk, an influential gay leader, who later challenged Baker to devise a symbol of pride for the gay community [7] The inspiration for the original gay pride flags may have been the Brotherhood Flag from 1938 [8] The original gay pride flags flew at the San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade celebration on June 25, 1978 [9] [10]\n\n\n1978 to 1979\nAfter the assassination of gay San Francisco City Supervisor Harvey Milk on November 27, 1978, [28] demand for the rainbow flag greatly increased In response, the San Francisco-based Paramount Flag Company began selling a version using stock rainbow fabric with seven stripes: red, orange, yellow, green, turquoise, blue, and violet As Baker ramped up production of his version of the flag, he too dropped the hot pink stripe because fabric in that color was not readily available The Paramount Flag Company also began selling a surplus stock of Rainbow Girls flags from its retail store on the southwest corner of Polk and Post, at which Gilbert Baker was an employee [29]\n\n\n1980s to 2000s\nIn 1989, the rainbow flag came to further nationwide attention in the U.S after John Stout sued his landlords and won when they attempted to prohibit him from displaying the flag from his West Hollywood, California, apartment balcony [31]\n\n\n2010s to present\nIn June 2015, The Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan added the rainbow flag symbol to its design collection [37] [38] [39]\n\n\nTransnationalism\nThe rainbow flag has been repurposed to manifest a multitude of transnational and globalized ways of being queer In a few scholarly articles, the rainbow flag is described as a \"floating signifier\" [45] [46] A floating signifier refers to the person giving the object its interpreted meaning and significance [46] Flags are ambivalent symbols that hold different ideologies, meanings, and agendas depending on the beholder Therefore, the rainbow flag is a boundary object that not only brings together queer communities locally and transnationally, but can also create debates and conflicts [45]\n\n\nHidden Flags\nThere have been many activism statements made with using the rainbow colors to create \"hidden flags\", in order to express their political agenda and support for gay rights and diversity \n\n\nCritiques\nConcern has been expressed among some of the rainbow symbol being white-washed and regressed to maintain a Eurocentric and colonial influence [46] A concept called \"pride for sale\" [54] refers to an overflowing amount of publicity and advertising from big companies displaying the rainbow flag and selling pride merchandise during Pride Month, but as soon as Pride Month is over so are all of the promotions (see rainbow capitalism) There is also a critique made about how the pride flag has deviated too much from its purpose as a radical symbol for queer rights specifically [46]\n\n\nNotable variations\nGilbert Baker created a nine-stripe version of the flag in March 2017, adding a lavender stripe to symbolize diversity Baker created the flag in response to the election of Donald Trump [55] [56] [57] [58]\n\n\nGilbert Baker's nine-stripe flag\nGilbert Baker created a nine-stripe version of the flag in March 2017, adding a lavender stripe to symbolize diversity Baker created the flag in response to the election of Donald Trump [55] [56] [57] [58]\n\n\nPhiladelphia eight-stripe flag\nIn June 2017, the city of Philadelphia adopted a revised version of the flag designed by the marketing firm Tierney that adds black and brown stripes to the top of the standard six-color flag, to draw attention to issues of people of color within the LGBT community [59] [60] [61]\n\n\nProgress Pride Flag\n\nIn June 2018, designer Daniel Quasar released a redesign incorporating elements from both the Philadelphia flag and trans pride flag to bring focus on inclusion and progress within the community [64] The flag design spread quickly as the Progress Pride Flag on social media, prompting worldwide coverage in news outlets [65] [66] [67] While retaining the common six-stripe rainbow design as a base, the \"Progress\" variation adds a chevron along the hoist that features black, brown, light blue, pink, and white stripes to bring those communities (marginalized people of color, trans people, and those living with HIV/AIDS and those who have been lost) to the forefront; \"the arrow points to the right to show forward movement, while being along the left edge shows that progress still needs to be made.\" [68]\n\n\nSocial Justice Pride Flag\nIn July 2018 the Social Justice Pride Flag was released in Chennai, India in the Chennai Queer LitFest inspired by the other variations of the Pride flag around the world [69] [70] The flag was designed by Chennai-based gay activist Moulee [71] The design incorporated elements representing Self-Respect Movement, anti-caste movement and leftist ideology in its design While retaining the original six stripes of the rainbow flag, the Social Justice Pride Flag incorporates black representing the Self-Respect Movement, blue representing Ambedkarite movement and red representing left values [72]\n\n\nNew Pride Flag\nThe rainbow flag design is diagonal black, brown, light blue, pink, and white stripes overlaid on a traditional six-color rainbow flag The design is intended to represent transgender and queer people of color Puerto Rican author and vegan activist Julia Feliz conceived the idea, and Hayley Brown designed the flag to focus on transgender and queer people of color [73] [74]\n\n\nIntersex Inclusive Progress Pride Flag\nIn 2021, Valentino Vecchietti of Intersex Equality Rights UK redesigned the Progress Pride Flag to incorporate the intersex flag [75] This design added a yellow triangle with a purple circle in it to the chevron of the Progress Pride flag It also changed the color of green to a lighter shade without adding new symbolism Intersex Equality Rights UK posted the new flag on Instagram and Twitter [76] [77]\n\n\nReception\nThe reception to new variations and iterations of the Pride Flag have been mixed [78] [79] [80] [81] Supporters have praised the focus on inclusion, and the highlighting the role and discrimination of people of color in the LGBT community At the same time, some have expressed concern that the changes only act as a \"performance, creating the impression of inclusion without real commitment\", or that they have been \"for the sake of branding\", while not reflecting any actual \"material steps towards real equality\" [78] Others have remained critical, arguing that the original design already acts as a symbol of diversity, [82] [79] and emphasized that the original flag was designed without any racial dimension in mind [79] Other critics have called the variations \"patronizing\" and that they have taken away some \"universality\" [81] Both the Philadelphia Pride Flag and the Progress Pride Flag were met with some controversy and backlash for these reasons, but also praise and widespread adoption [79] [83]\n\n\nOther Variations\nMany variations of the rainbow flag have been used Some of the more common ones include the Greek letter lambda (lower case) in white in the middle of the flag and a pink triangle or black triangle in the upper left corner Other colors have been added, such as a black stripe symbolizing those community members lost to AIDS [86] The rainbow colors have also often been used in gay alterations of national and regional flags, replacing for example the red and white stripes of the flag of the United States In 2007, the Pride Family Flag was unveiled at the Houston, Texas pride parade [clarification needed]\n\n\nGovernment flags\nWhile the rainbow flag has not been officially incorporated into the flags in any countries, some states and municipalities have flown the pride flag alongside the state flag to demonstrate inclusivity and support for LGBTQ+ communities [97] Some countries, like Germany, allow the Pride flag to be flown on government buildings on specific occasions [98] Some states, provinces and municipalities allow the Pride Flag to be flown on government buildings [99] Embassies and consulates of LGBTQ+ friendly countries may fly the Pride flag alongside their national flag to show solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community [100]\n\n\nNotable flag creations\nFor the 25th anniversary of the June 1969 Stonewall Riots in 1994, flag creator Baker, aka Sister Chanel 2001 of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, was commissioned to create the world's largest rainbow flag [105] The mile-long flag, dubbed \"Raise the Rainbow\", [106] took months of planning and teams of volunteers to coordinate every aspect [106] The flag utilized the basic six colors and measured 30 feet (9.1 m) wide After the march, foot-wide (0.30 m) sections of the flag were given to individual sponsors after the event had ended Additional large sections of the flag were sent with activists and used in pride parades and LGBTQ marches worldwide [105] One large section was later taken to Shanghai Pride in 2014 by a small contingent of San Francisco Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, and documented in the film Stilettos for Shanghai [107] The Guinness Book of World Records confirmed it as the world's largest flag [108]\n\n\nMile-long flags\nFor the 25th anniversary of the June 1969 Stonewall Riots

mark the fourth Nelson Mandela Bay (NMB) Pride in 2014, [113] held in the city of Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape province, South Africa [114] It measures twelve by eight metres (39 by 26 ft), and flies on the country's tallest flag pole, which is sixty metres (200 ft) high, [114] and is in Donkin Reserve, in Port Elizabeth's central business district [115] NMB Pride had the flag manufactured, in part, as a symbol for LGBT youth to feel empowered even if they were not able to come out [115] On the decision to fly the flag, a spokesperson for the municipality said, NMB \"officially adds its voice to governments committing, firstly, to recognizing the LGBT community, and most importantly, to uphold the rights of the LGBT community\" [116] It is regularly flown for NMB Pride as well as March 21 which is Human Rights Day in South Africa, and International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, both commemorating the 1960 Sharpeville massacre.\n\n\nInfluence\nThe popularity of the rainbow flag has influenced the creation and adoption of a wide variety of multi-color multi-striped flags used to communicate specific identities within the LGBT community, including the bisexual pride flag, [126] pansexual pride flag, [127] and transgender pride flags [128]\n\n\nAdditional pride flags\nThe popularity of the rainbow flag has influenced the creation and adoption of a

show support for LGBT youth who are victims of bullying [129] [130] [131]\n\n\nNotable incorporations of the rainbow flag\nFreedom Rings, designed by David Spada in 1991, are six aluminum rings, each in one of the colors of the rainbow flag These rings are worn by themselves or as part of necklaces, bracelets, and keychains [132] They are a symbol of gay pride, and were originally sold as a fundraiser for the 1991 San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade and quickly became a national trend In June 1992, several of MTV's on-air hosts wore Freedom Rings in recognition of Pride Month, elevating their visibility [133] [134] They are sometimes referred to as \"Fruit Loops\" [135]\n\n\nFreedom Rings\nFreedom Rings, designed by David Spada in 1991, are six aluminum rings, each in one of the

from April 2019 after a tweet from the official account of the far-right party Vox, after which a multitude of users belonging to the LGBT movement began to use it as a symbol The icon has established itself as an example of the phenomenon of reappropriation of elements of the anti-LGBT discourse in contemporary society through social networks [136] [137]\n\n\nRainbow crossings\nBeginning in the 2010s, cities around the world have begun installing rainbow crossings to celebrate the LGBTQIA+ community, many of which have been made permanent in cities such as Seattle, Paris, San Francisco and Sydney.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "The Rainbow Flag (LGBT)\n\nThe rainbow flag, also known as the pride flag, is a symbol of the LGBTQ+ community, representing diversity, inclusivity, and self-expression. The flag was first designed in 1978 by Gilbert Baker, an American artist and gay rights activist, and has since become a widely recognized and iconic symbol of the LGBTQ+ movement.\n\n## History\n\nGilbert Baker was born in 1951 in Parsons, Kansas, and grew up in a conservative household. After serving in the U.S. Army from 1970 to 1972, Baker became involved in the gay rights movement and began to develop his artistic skills. In 1974, Baker met Harvey Milk, a prominent gay rights activist and politician, who challenged Baker to create a symbol of pride for the gay community.\n\nThe original gay pride flag was inspired by the Brotherhood Flag, a symbol of unity and solidarity created in 1938. Baker's design was meant to be a symbol of hope and freedom for the LGBTQ+ community, and it was first flown at the San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade on June 25, 1978.\n\n## Origin\n\nGilbert Baker's design for the rainbow flag was initially intended to have eight colors, but due to fabric limitations, the final version included seven stripes: red, orange, yellow, green, turquoise, blue, and violet. The colors of the flag were chosen to represent the diversity and inclusivity of the LGBTQ+ community, and the design was meant to be a symbol of hope and freedom.\n\n## 1978 to 1979\n\nAfter the assassination of Harvey Milk on November 27, 1978, demand for the rainbow flag increased, and Baker began to produce the flag on a larger scale.

The flag has been used as a symbol of solidarity and unity, and it has also been criticized for its Eurocentric and colonial connotations.\n\n## Hidden Flags\n\nIn recent years, activists have used the rainbow colors to create \"hidden flags,\" which are subtle and discreet symbols of support for LGBTQ+ rights and diversity. These hidden flags have been used in various contexts, including social media, art, and activism.\n\n## Critiques\n\nSome critics have argued that the rainbow flag has become a symbol of consumerism and commercialization, with companies using the flag to sell merchandise and promote their brands.

an honorable discharge, Baker taught himself to sew In 1974, Baker met Harvey Milk, an influential gay leader, who later challenged Baker to devise a symbol of pride for the gay community [7] The inspiration for the original gay pride flags may have been the Brotherhood Flag from 1938 [8] The original gay pride flags flew at the San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade celebration on June 25, 1978 [9] [10]\n\n\nOrigin\nGilbert Baker, born in 1951 and raised in Parsons, Kansas, had served in the U.S Army between 1970 and 1972 After an honorable discharge, Baker taught himself to sew In 1974, Baker met Harvey Milk, an influential gay leader, who later challenged Baker to devise a symbol of pride for the gay community [7] The inspiration for the original gay pride flags may have been the Brotherhood Flag from 1938 [8] The original gay pride flags flew at the San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade celebration on June 25, 1978 [9] [10]\n\n\n1978 to 1979\nAfter the assassination of gay San Francisco City Supervisor Harvey Milk on November 27, 1978, [28] demand for the rainbow flag greatly increased In response, the San Francisco-based Paramount Flag Company began selling a version using stock rainbow fabric with seven stripes: red, orange, yellow, green, turquoise, blue, and violet As Baker ramped up production of his version of the flag, he too dropped the hot pink stripe because fabric in that color was not readily available The Paramount Flag Company also began selling a surplus stock of Rainbow Girls flags from its retail store on the southwest corner of Polk and Post, at which Gilbert Baker was an employee [29]\n\n\n1980s to 2000s\nIn 1989, the rainbow flag came to further nationwide attention in the U.S after John Stout sued his landlords and won when they attempted to prohibit him from displaying the flag from his West Hollywood, California, apartment balcony [31]\n\n\n2010s to present\nIn June 2015, The Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan added the rainbow flag symbol to its design collection [37] [38] [39]\n\n\nTransnationalism\nThe rainbow flag has been repurposed to manifest a multitude of transnational and globalized ways of being queer In a few scholarly articles, the rainbow flag is described as a \"floating signifier\" [45] [46] A floating signifier refers to the person giving the object its interpreted meaning and significance [46] Flags are ambivalent symbols that hold different ideologies, meanings, and agendas depending on the beholder Therefore, the rainbow flag is a boundary object that not only brings together queer communities locally and transnationally, but can also create debates and conflicts [45]\n\n\nHidden Flags\nThere have been many activism statements made with using the rainbow colors to create \"hidden flags\", in order to express their political agenda and support for gay rights and diversity \n\n\nCritiques\nConcern has been expressed among some of the rainbow symbol being white-washed and regressed to maintain a Eurocentric and colonial influence [46] A concept called \"pride for sale\" [54] refers to an overflowing amount of publicity and advertising from big companies displaying the rainbow flag and selling pride merchandise during Pride Month, but as soon as Pride Month is over so are all of the promotions (see rainbow capitalism) There is also a critique made about how the pride flag has deviated too much from its purpose as a radical symbol for queer rights specifically [46]\n\n\nNotable variations\nGilbert Baker created a nine-stripe version of the flag in March 2017, adding a lavender stripe to symbolize diversity Baker created the flag in response to the election of Donald Trump [55] [56] [57] [58]\n\n\nGilbert Baker's nine-stripe flag\nGilbert Baker created a nine-stripe version of the flag in March 2017, adding a lavender stripe to symbolize diversity Baker created the flag in response to the election of Donald Trump [55] [56] [57] [58]\n\n\nPhiladelphia eight-stripe flag\nIn June 2017, the city of Philadelphia adopted a revised version of the flag designed by the marketing firm Tierney that adds black and brown stripes to the top of the standard six-color flag, to draw attention to issues of people of color within the LGBT community [59] [60] [61]\n\n\nProgress Pride Flag\n\nIn June 2018, designer Daniel Quasar released a redesign incorporating elements from both the Philadelphia flag and trans pride flag to bring focus on inclusion and progress within the community [64] The flag design spread quickly as the Progress Pride Flag on social media, prompting worldwide coverage in news outlets [65] [66] [67] While retaining the common six-stripe rainbow design as a base, the \"Progress\" variation adds a chevron along the hoist that features black, brown, light blue, pink, and white stripes to bring those communities (marginalized people of color, trans people, and those living with HIV/AIDS and those who have been lost) to the forefront; \"the arrow points to the right to show forward movement, while being along the left edge shows that progress still needs to be made.\" [68]\n\n\nSocial Justice Pride Flag\nIn July 2018 the Social Justice Pride Flag was released in Chennai, India in the Chennai Queer LitFest inspired by the other variations of the Pride flag around the world [69] [70] The flag was designed by Chennai-based gay activist Moulee [71] The design incorporated elements representing Self-Respect Movement, anti-caste movement and leftist ideology in its design While retaining the original six stripes of the rainbow flag, the Social Justice Pride Flag incorporates black representing the Self-Respect Movement, blue representing Ambedkarite movement and red representing left values [72]\n\n\nNew Pride Flag\nThe rainbow flag design is diagonal black, brown, light blue, pink, and white stripes overlaid on a traditional six-color rainbow flag The design is intended to represent transgender and queer people of color Puerto Rican author and vegan activist Julia Feliz conceived the idea, and Hayley Brown designed the flag to focus on transgender and queer people of color [73] [74]\n\n\nIntersex Inclusive Progress Pride Flag\nIn 2021, Valentino Vecchietti of Intersex Equality Rights UK redesigned the Progress Pride Flag to incorporate the intersex flag [75] This design added a yellow triangle with a purple circle in it to the chevron of the Progress Pride flag It also changed the color of green to a lighter shade without adding new symbolism Intersex Equality Rights UK posted the new flag on Instagram and Twitter [76] [77]\n\n\nReception\nThe reception to new variations and iterations of the Pride Flag have been mixed [78] [79] [80] [81] Supporters have praised the focus on inclusion, and the highlighting the role and discrimination of people of color in the LGBT community At the same time, some have expressed concern that the changes only act as a \"performance, creating the impression of inclusion without real commitment\", or that they have been \"for the sake of branding\", while not reflecting any actual \"material steps towards real equality\" [78] Others have remained critical, arguing that the original design already acts as a symbol of diversity, [82] [79] and emphasized that the original flag was designed without any racial dimension in mind [79] Other critics have called the variations \"patronizing\" and that they have taken away some \"universality\" [81] Both the Philadelphia Pride Flag and the Progress Pride Flag were met with some controversy and backlash for these reasons, but also praise and widespread adoption [79] [83]\n\n\nOther Variations\nMany variations of the rainbow flag have been used Some of the more common ones include the Greek letter lambda (lower case) in white in the middle of the flag and a pink triangle or black triangle in the upper left corner Other colors have been added, such as a black stripe symbolizing those community members lost to AIDS [86] The rainbow colors have also often been used in gay alterations of national and regional flags, replacing for example the red and white stripes of the flag of the United States In 2007, the Pride Family Flag was unveiled at the Houston, Texas pride parade [clarification needed]\n\n\nGovernment flags\nWhile the rainbow flag has not been officially incorporated into the flags in any countries, some states and municipalities have flown the pride flag alongside the state flag to demonstrate inclusivity and support for LGBTQ+ communities [97] Some countries, like Germany, allow the Pride flag to be flown on government buildings on specific occasions [98] Some states, provinces and municipalities allow the Pride Flag to be flown on government buildings [99] Embassies and consulates of LGBTQ+ friendly countries may fly the Pride flag alongside their national flag to show solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community [100]\n\n\nNotable flag creations\nFor the 25th anniversary of the June 1969 Stonewall Riots in 1994, flag creator Baker, aka Sister Chanel 2001 of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, was commissioned to create the world's largest rainbow flag [105] The mile-long flag, dubbed \"Raise the Rainbow\", [106] took months of planning and teams of volunteers to coordinate every aspect [106] The flag utilized the basic six colors and measured 30 feet (9.1 m) wide After the march, foot-wide (0.30 m) sections of the flag were given to individual sponsors after the event had ended Additional large sections of the flag were sent with activists and used in pride parades and LGBTQ marches worldwide [105] One large section was later taken to Shanghai Pride in 2014 by a small contingent of San Francisco Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, and documented in the film Stilettos for Shanghai [107] The Guinness Book of World Records confirmed it as the world's largest flag [108]\n\n\nMile-long flags\nFor the 25th anniversary of the June 1969 Stonewall Riots

mark the fourth Nelson Mandela Bay (NMB) Pride in 2014, [113] held in the city of Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape province, South Africa [114] It measures twelve by eight metres (39 by 26 ft), and flies on the country's tallest flag pole, which is sixty metres (200 ft) high, [114] and is in Donkin Reserve, in Port Elizabeth's central business district [115] NMB Pride had the flag manufactured, in part, as a symbol for LGBT youth to feel empowered even if they were not able to come out [115] On the decision to fly the flag, a spokesperson for the municipality said, NMB \"officially adds its voice to governments committing, firstly, to recognizing the LGBT community, and most importantly, to uphold the rights of the LGBT community\" [116] It is regularly flown for NMB Pride as well as March 21 which is Human Rights Day in South Africa, and International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, both commemorating the 1960 Sharpeville massacre.\n\n\nInfluence\nThe popularity

October 2017, the U.S., along with 13 other nations, voted against a U.N Human Rights Council resolution that condemned the use of capital punishment when \"applied arbitrarily or in a discriminatory manner\" and specifically condemned \"the imposition of the death penalty as a sanction for specific forms of conduct, such as apostasy, blasphemy, adultery and consensual same-sex relations.\" LGBTQ rights advocates in the U.S., including the Human Rights Campaign, were critical of the vote After the vote, a State Department spokeswoman said that the U.S voted against the resolution \"because of broader concerns with the resolution's approach in condemning the death penalty in all circumstances\" and said that the U.S \"unequivocally condemns the application of the death penalty for conduct such as homosexuality, blasphemy, adultery, and apostasy We do not consider such conduct appropriate for criminalization.\" [177]\n\n\nComments on Trump sexual abuse allegations\nIn December 2017, Haley said that the women who had accused President Trump of touching or groping them without their consent \"should be heard, and should be dealt with.. And I think any woman who has felt violated or felt mistreated in any way, they have every right to speak up.\" When questioned on whether the accusations were a \"settled issue\" as a result of the

to them.\" [178]\n\n\nWithdrawal of U.S. from Human Rights Council\nOn June 19, 2018, Haley and U.S Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the U.S was pulling out of the United Nations Human Rights Council, accusing the council of being \"hypocritical and self-serving\"; in the past, Haley had accused it of \"chronic anti-Israel bias.\" [179] \"When the Human Rights Council treats Israel worse than North Korea, Iran, and Syria, it is the Council itself that is foolish and unworthy of its name It is time for the countries who know better to demand changes,\" Haley said at the time, pointing to the council's adoption of five resolutions condemning Israel [180]\n\n\nChina\nIn October 2018, Haley raised the issue of China's re-education camps and human rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim minority She said that \"At least a million Uighurs and other Muslim minorities have been imprisoned in so-called 're-education camps' in western China,\" and detainees are \"tortured...forced to renounce their religion and to pledge allegiance to the Communist Party.\" [181]\n\n\nResignation\nOn October 9, 2018, Haley resigned as the U.N ambassador, effective December

bad terms [185] He even raised the possibility she might rejoin the administration later \"in a different capacity\" [186] Haley portrayed her departure as the act of a conscientious public servant, saying, \"I think you have to be selfless enough to know when you step aside and allow someone else to do the job.\" [185] The news shocked allied diplomats and other senior White House officials [185] [186] Kelly Craft succeeded Haley in the post [187]\n\n\nTheories behind the resignation\nHaley's sudden resignation stunned the political world and multiple theories were floated as potential reasons [188] [186] A theory many political commentators cited was that her \"voice of moderation\" was not in line with those of newly appointed Trump cabinet officials such as John Bolton and Mike Pompeo Haley wielded more influence than Rex Tillerson, then secretary of state, during the first year of the Trump administration, acting almost as a \"shadow secretary of state\" [189] On this theory, Haley left on her own terms after seeing her influence shrink after Pompeo was appointed secretary of state [188]\n\n\nPost-United Nations interlude (2019–2022)\nIn 2019, Haley created a new 501(c)(4) advocacy group, Stand for America [192] [193] Stand for America did not disclose its donors, but a document subsequently obtained by the press showed that it raised $71 million in 2019 from several billionaires and well-known Republican Party mega-donors, including Paul Singer, Stanley Druckenmiller, Sheldon and Miriam Adelson, and Scott Bessent [193] Haley's team unsuccessfully demanded that Politico not report on the donor list it had obtained [193]\n\n\nInteraction with Donald Trump\nDuring the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, Haley supported and campaigned for U.S Senator

her readiness to \"shred\" such an agreement on her first day in office [232]\n\n\nPositions and policies during presidential campaign\nIn February 2023, Haley supported a proposal by Senator Lindsey Graham to establish a national 15-week abortion ban, with exceptions for rape, incest, health, and life of the mother, arguing that this proposal had a chance at gaining a \"national consensus.\" [261] [262] [263] In May 2023, she pledged to sign a federal abortion ban, without specifying how many weeks such a ban should cover [262] In an August 2023 primary debate, Haley refused to directly say whether she supported a federal abortion ban [264] She supports promoting access to contraception [263] [264] Following an Alabama Supreme Court decision ruling that embryos are children under state law and, therefore, that fertility clinics are liable for embryos as if they were children, Haley said she agreed with the court's reasoning and that \"embryos, to me, are babies.\" [265] [266] After backlash against the ruling, Haley distanced herself from her previous comments, saying that she agrees that an embryo is an \"unborn baby\" but does not agree with the effect of the Alabama ruling on fertility clinics [267]\n\n\nSocial issues\nIn February 2023, Haley supported a proposal by Senator Lindsey Graham to establish a national 15-week abortion ban, with exceptions for rape,

saying that she agrees that an embryo is an \"unborn baby\" but does not agree with the effect of the Alabama ruling on fertility clinics [267]\n\n\nFiscal issues\nOn fiscal policy, Haley has indicated that she would be willing to make significant budget cuts, including to Medicare and Social Security [263] She has called for raising the retirement age for future Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries (without identifying a specific age) and supports means-testing the programs [277] [278] She criticized both the pandemic relief act enacted by Democrats in 2021 and the initial pandemic relief act enacted by Republicans and signed by Trump in March 2020 [263]\n\n\nTrump and DeSantis\nReferencing Trump's tenure, Haley said, \"We cannot have four years of chaos, vendettas and drama.\" She added, \"America needs a captain who will steady the ship, not capsize it,\" emphasizing that she would support America's allies rather than praising dictators such as Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un [279]\n\n\nEnvironment and energy\nHaley has acknowledged that climate change is caused by human activity, but has rejected policies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions [263] She has pledged, if elected, to again withdraw the U.S from the Paris Agreement, revoke regulations restricting fossil fuel production and curtailing pollution from power plants and vehicles, and eliminate renewable energy subsidies [263] She criticized the Biden administration's decision to allocate funds appropriated by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal to create a national electric vehicle charging network [263]\n\n\nForeign policy\nIn a February 2023 op-ed published by the New York Post, Haley vowed to \"cut every cent in foreign aid for countries\" that she deemed \"enemies\" of the United States [284] In June 2023, she attacked Trump and DeSantis for their positions on the Russian invasion of Ukraine [285] She said that Biden had not done enough on Ukraine, but did not detail what she would do differently as president [263]\n\n\nTerm limits\nIn February 2023, Haley announced that she supports congressional term limits and \"mandatory mental competence tests for politicians over 75 years old,\" which received mixed feedback from U.S senators [291]\n\n\nLabor\nHaley opposes labor unions and has called herself a \"union buster\" [292] As governor, she sought to stop workers at South Carolina's Boeing plant from unionizing, pledging to \"make the unions understand full well that they are not needed, not wanted and not welcome in the state of South Carolina.\" [293] [294]\n\n\nAmerican Civil War and slavery\nAt a town hall in Berlin, New Hampshire, on December 27, 2023, Haley responded to a question about the origins of the American Civil War: \"I think the cause of the Civil War was basically how government was going to run The freedoms and what people could and couldn't do.\" After receiving criticism for her failure to mention slavery, Haley restated her position the next day, saying, \"Of course the Civil War was about slavery.\" [295] On January 16, 2024, Haley stated, \"The US has never been a racist country.\" [296] [297]\n\n\nPost-presidential politics\nOn April 15, 2024, it was announced that Haley would join the Hudson Institute, a conservative think-tank [298] In a statement released on the same day, she described the group's work as \"critical\" and said she \"looked forward to partnering with them to defend the principles that make America the greatest country in the world\" She will serve as the next Walter P Stern Chair

And I think any woman who has felt violated or felt mistreated in any way, they have every right to speak up.\" When questioned on whether the accusations were a \"settled issue\" as a result of the 2016 election, she stated that this was \"for the people to decide I know that he was elected But, you know, women should always feel comfortable coming forward And we should all be willing to listen to them.\" [178]\n\n\nWithdrawal of U.S. from Human Rights Council\nOn June 19, 2018, Haley and U.S Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the U.S was pulling out of the United Nations Human Rights Council, accusing the council of being \"hypocritical and self-serving\"; in the past, Haley had accused it of \"chronic anti-Israel bias.\" [179] \"When the Human Rights Council treats Israel worse than North Korea, Iran, and Syria, it is the Council itself that is foolish and unworthy of its name It is time for the countries who know better to demand changes,\" Haley said at the time, pointing to the council's adoption of five resolutions condemning Israel [180]\n\n\nChina\nIn October 2018, Haley raised the issue of China's re-education camps and human rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim minority She said that \"At least a million Uighurs and other Muslim minorities have been imprisoned in so-called 're-education camps' in western China,\" and detainees are \"tortured...forced to renounce their religion and to pledge allegiance to the Communist Party.\" [181]\n\n\nResignation\nOn October 9, 2018, Haley resigned as the U.N ambassador, effective December 31, 2018 [182] [183] [184]  Trump heaped praise on Haley, declaring she was \"special to me\" at the Oval Office meeting where her resignation was announced, emphasizing that she was not leaving on bad terms [185] He even raised the possibility she might rejoin the administration later \"in a different capacity\" [186] Haley portrayed her departure as the act of a conscientious public servant, saying, \"I think you have to be selfless enough to know when you step aside and allow someone else to do the job.\" [185] The news shocked allied diplomats and other senior White House officials [185] [186] Kelly Craft succeeded Haley in the post [187]\n\n\nTheories behind the resignation\nHaley's sudden resignation stunned the political world and multiple theories were floated as potential reasons [188] [186] A theory many political commentators cited was that her \"voice of moderation\" was not in line with those of newly appointed Trump cabinet officials such as John Bolton and Mike Pompeo Haley wielded more influence than Rex Tillerson, then secretary of state, during the first year of the Trump administration, acting almost as a \"shadow secretary of state\" [189] On this theory, Haley left on her own terms after seeing her influence shrink after Pompeo was appointed secretary of state [188]\n\n\nPost-United Nations interlude (2019–2022)\nIn 2019, Haley created a new 501(c)(4) advocacy group, Stand for America [192] [193] Stand for America did not disclose its donors, but a document subsequently obtained by the press showed that it raised $71 million in 2019 from several billionaires and well-known Republican Party mega-donors, including Paul Singer, Stanley Druckenmiller, Sheldon and Miriam Adelson, and Scott Bessent [193] Haley's team unsuccessfully demanded that Politico not report on the donor list it had obtained [193]\n\n\nInteraction with Donald Trump\nDuring the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, Haley supported and campaigned for U.S Senator Marco Rubio of Florida [211] After Rubio dropped out of the election, she supported Ted Cruz [212]\n\n\nPresidential campaign (2023–2024)\nIn July 2022, Haley hinted at a potential run for the 2024 United States presidential election during her speech at the Christians United for Israel summit in Washington, D.C Her strong stance against any potential Iran nuclear deal resonated, as she asserted her readiness to \"shred\" such an agreement on her first day in office [232]\n\n\nPositions and policies during presidential campaign\nIn February 2023, Haley supported a proposal by Senator Lindsey Graham to establish a national 15-week abortion ban, with exceptions for rape, incest, health, and life of the mother, arguing that this proposal had a chance at gaining a \"national consensus.\" [261] [262] [263] In May 2023, she pledged to sign a federal abortion ban, without specifying how many weeks such a ban should cover [262] In an August 2023 primary debate, Haley refused to directly say whether she supported a federal abortion ban [264] She supports promoting access to contraception [263] [264] Following an Alabama Supreme Court decision ruling that embryos are children under state law and, therefore, that fertility clinics are liable for embryos as if they were children, Haley said she agreed with the court's reasoning and that \"embryos, to me, are babies.\" [265] [266] After backlash against the ruling, Haley distanced herself from her previous comments, saying that she agrees that an embryo is an \"unborn baby\" but does not agree with the effect of the Alabama ruling on fertility clinics [267]\n\n\nSocial issues\nIn February 2023, Haley supported a proposal by Senator Lindsey Graham to establish a national 15-week abortion ban, with exceptions for rape, incest, health, and life of the mother, arguing that this proposal had a chance at gaining a \"national consensus.\" [261] [262] [263] In May 2023, she pledged to sign a federal abortion ban, without specifying how many weeks such a ban should cover [262] In an August 2023 primary debate, Haley refused to directly say whether she supported a federal abortion ban [264] She supports promoting access to contraception [263] [264] Following an Alabama Supreme Court decision ruling that embryos are children under state law and, therefore, that fertility clinics are liable for embryos as if they were children, Haley said she agreed with the court's reasoning and that \"embryos, to me, are babies.\" [265] [266] After backlash against the ruling, Haley distanced herself from her previous comments, saying that she agrees that an embryo is an \"unborn baby\" but does not agree with the effect of the Alabama ruling on fertility clinics [267]\n\n\nFiscal issues\nOn fiscal policy, Haley has indicated that she would be willing to make significant budget cuts, including to Medicare and Social Security [263] She has called for raising the retirement age for future Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries (without identifying a specific age) and supports means-testing the programs [277] [278] She criticized both the pandemic relief act enacted by Democrats in 2021 and the initial pandemic relief act enacted by Republicans and signed by Trump in March 2020 [263]\n\n\nTrump and DeSantis\nReferencing Trump's tenure, Haley said, \"We cannot have four years of chaos, vendettas and drama.\" She added, \"America needs a captain who will steady the ship, not capsize it,\" emphasizing that she would support America's allies rather than praising dictators such as Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un [279]\n\n\nEnvironment and energy\nHaley has acknowledged that climate change is caused by human activity, but has rejected policies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions [263] She has pledged, if elected, to again withdraw the U.S from the Paris Agreement, revoke regulations restricting fossil fuel production and curtailing pollution from power plants and vehicles, and eliminate renewable energy subsidies [263] She criticized the Biden administration's decision to allocate funds appropriated by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal to create a national electric vehicle charging network [263]\n\n\nForeign policy\nIn a February 2023 op-ed published by the New York Post, Haley vowed to \"cut every cent in foreign aid for countries\" that she deemed \"enemies\" of the United States [284] In June 2023, she attacked Trump and DeSantis for their positions on the Russian invasion of Ukraine [285] She said that Biden had not done enough on Ukraine, but did not detail what she would do differently as president [263]\n\n\nTerm limits\nIn February 2023, Haley announced that she supports congressional term limits and \"mandatory mental competence tests for politicians over 75 years old,\" which received mixed feedback from U.S senators [291]\n\n\nLabor\nHaley opposes labor unions and has called herself a \"union buster\" [292] As governor, she sought to stop workers at South Carolina's Boeing plant from unionizing, pledging to \"make the unions understand full well that they are not needed, not wanted and not welcome in the state of South Carolina.\" [293] [294]\n\n\nAmerican Civil War and slavery\nAt a town hall in Berlin, New Hampshire, on December 27, 2023, Haley responded to a question about the origins of the American Civil War: \"I think the cause of the Civil War was basically how government was going to run The freedoms and what people could and couldn't do.\" After receiving criticism for her failure to mention slavery, Haley restated her position the next day, saying, \"Of course the Civil War was about slavery.\" [295] On January 16, 2024, Haley stated, \"The US has never been a racist country.\" [296] [297]\n\n\nPost-presidential politics\nOn April 15, 2024, it was announced that Haley would join the Hudson Institute, a conservative think-tank [298] In a statement released on the same day, she described the group's work as \"critical\" and said she \"looked forward to partnering with them to defend the principles that make America the greatest country in the world\" She will serve as the next Walter P Stern Chair [299]\n\n\nPersonal life\nHaley married Michael Haley on September 7, 1996 [313] They celebrated with both Sikh and Methodist ceremonies [38] The couple have two children, Rena (b 1998) and Nalin (b 2001) [314] [315]\n\n\nBooks\nHaley was inducted into the Order of the Palmetto in 2010 [330] She has two honorary degrees: a Doctorate of Humanities from Clemson University (2018) [331] and a Doctorate of Public Service from the University of South Carolina (2015) [332] [333] In 2013, Haley received an honorary 4th-dan black belt in Taekwondo [334] [335] [336]\n\n\nAwards and honors\nHaley

It is a wealthy maritime Asian island port nation, modeled after Singapore, and is known for its unique geography and social structure.\n\n# Publication History\n\nMadripoor first appeared in The New Mutants #32 (October 1985), created by Chris Claremont and Steve Leialoha. The character was featured heavily in the Wolverine solo series, which started in 1988, written by Chris Claremont and illustrated by John Buscema. This series showcased Madripoor as a central location, exploring its culture, politics, and inhabitants.\n\n# History\n\nMadripoor is a fictional location, modeled after Singapore, a wealthy maritime Asian island port nation. However, Madripoor is not identical to Singapore, as both exist in the Marvel Universe. The comics explicitly state that Madripoor is an island south of Singapore. This distinction is essential, as it highlights the unique characteristics of Madripoor. Unlike Singapore, Madripoor is divided into two distinct areas: Hightown and Lowtown. Hightown is the wealthy and affluent part of the island, while Lowtown is plagued by crime and poverty.\n\nThe history of Madripoor is deeply connected to its geography. The island is approximately 100 miles in diameter, with a coastline featuring deep water bays and inlets. The center of the island is a large plateau with steep cliffs, which creates a unique landscape. Madripoor's geography has been shaped by its location on the head of a giant dragon, which is as large as an island continent. This fantastical element adds to the island's mystique and isolation.\n\n# Geography\n\nMadripoor's geography is a crucial aspect of its culture and society. The island's unique shape, with its deep water bays and inlets, has led to the development of a maritime economy. The coastal towns and cities are bustling with trade and commerce, while the interior of the island is home to dense rainforests and towering mountains. The large plateau at the center of the island is a hub for agriculture and animal husbandry, providing a steady supply of food for the island's inhabitants.\n\nThe island's geography has also influenced its climate. Madripoor experiences a tropical climate, with high temperatures and humidity levels throughout the year. The island is prone to natural disasters, such as typhoons and earthquakes, which have shaped the island's culture and resilience.\n\n# Points of Interest\n\nMadripoor is home to numerous points of interest, each with its unique character and significance. Some of these points include:\n\n* The Grand Bazaar: A bustling marketplace where visitors can find exotic goods and local cuisine.\n* The Temple of the Dragon: A sacred site dedicated to the worship of the giant dragon that lies beneath the island.\n* The Museum of Madripoor: A repository of the island's history, culture, and natural heritage.\n* The Snake Eyes Casino: A popular destination for gamblers and thrill-seekers.\n\n# Known Residents\n\nMadripoor is home to a diverse population, including notable figures from the Marvel Universe. Some of the known residents include:\n\n* Wolverine: The legendary mutant, who has called Madripoor home on several occasions.\n* Gambit: The charismatic thief and mutant, who has a deep connection to the island and its culture.\n* X-23: The young mutant, who has visited Madripoor on several occasions and has a deep respect for the island's people and traditions.\n* Rancor: A notorious crime lord, who has a presence in Madripoor and is known for his ruthless tactics.\n\n# Alternate Versions\n\nA future version of Madripoor is the site of a battle between the Guardians of the Galaxy and the criminal gang headed by Rancor. This alternate version of the island is a dystopian nightmare, where the island's unique culture and society have been destroyed by corruption and violence.\n\n# In Other Media\n\nMadripoor has appeared in various forms of media, including:\n\n* Television: Madripoor has been featured in several animated series, including X-Men: The Animated Series and Wolverine and the X-Men.\n* Film: Madripoor has been mentioned in several live-action films, including the X-Men film series.\n\nMadripoor remains a fascinating and enigmatic location in the Marvel Universe, with its unique culture, geography, and history continuing to captivate fans and inspire creators. Its significance extends beyond its fictional world, offering insights into the complexities of human society and the power of imagination.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Madripoor\" following this outline:\n\n\nPublication history\nMadripoor first appeared in The New Mutants #32 (October 1985) It was created by Chris Claremont and Steve Leialoha Madripoor was featured heavily in the Wolverine solo series (starting 1988) Penned by Chris Claremont and artwork by John Buscema.\n\n\nHistory\nMadripoor is a fictional location apparently modeled on Singapore [1] [2] They are both wealthy maritime Asian island port nations at a strategic location with a single major city However, Madripoor is not Singapore itself, as Singapore exists in the Marvel Universe as well, including the comics explicitly stating Madripoor as it being an island south of Singapore Also distinct from Singapore is that Madripoor is divided between a Hightown and Lowtown, places which are wealthy and crime-stricken respectively [1] X-23 and Gambit once chartered a boat from Singapore to Madripoor, showing that they are both distinct locations.\n\n\nGeography\nMadripoor is estimated to be 100 miles (160 km) in diameter Its coastline is pockmarked with deep water bays and inlets The center of the island is a large plateau with steep cliffs As mentioned above, Madripoor rests on the head of a giant dragon that is as large as an island continent [13]\n\n\nPoints of interest\nThe following are locations found in Madripoor:\n\n\nKnown residents\nNotable current and former residents of Madripoor include:\n\n\nAlternate versions\nA future version of Madripoor is the site of a battle between the Guardians of the Galaxy and the criminal gang headed by Rancor.\" [39]\n\n\nIn other media\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

to 20th Century Fox [16] After completing work on the 2014 film The Fault in Our Stars for 20th Century Fox, director Josh Boone created a comic book with his childhood best friend Knate Lee using panels from Chris Claremont and Bill Sienkiewicz's New Mutants comics to illustrate what a potential film trilogy adapting those comics would be like The pair had been fans of the characters growing up, with Boone calling the stories \"really dark, interesting, and different from the typical X-Men stories that we had read\" Boone and Lee took the comic to Simon Kinberg, one of the producers of the X-Men film series, who \"really liked it\" [17] In May 2015, Fox finalized a deal to have Boone direct The New Mutants, from a script by himself and Lee, with Kinberg and Donner producing The film was initially intended to expand the universe of the X-Men franchise and take place three years after X-Men: Apocalypse (2016) [18] [19] While working on the first draft of the script, Boone sent it and his ideas for the film to Sienkiewicz, who thought Boone \"had it figured out\" and was not just copying the comics [20]\n\n\nDevelopment\nIn 2009, X-Men film series producer Lauren Shuler Donner

and was not just copying the comics [20]\n\n\nPre-production\nThe film entered pre-production in Boston, Massachusetts, in April 2017, in preparation for filming to begin in that city Location scouting took place, including at Medfield State Hospital which was previously used as a filming location for Shutter Island (2010) [28] Fox scheduled New Mutants for an April 13, 2018 release [29] Several weeks later, the studio officially announced the casting of Taylor-Joy and Williams and that it was \"making serious efforts to find ethnically appropriate actors\" for the rest of the cast, searching for South American and Native American actors to respectively play Sunspot and Moonstar By then, McAvoy was no longer slated to appear in the film; [30] Wolff was no longer in the running to portray Cannonball; [30] and Karen Rosenfelt was producing alongside Kinberg, [10] who ultimately spent much of production focused on making Dark Phoenix (2019) [31]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on July 10, 2017, in Boston, under the working title Growing Pains [28] [36] [37] Peter Deming served as cinematographer for the film [36] The majority of the film was shot on location at Medfield State Hospital, where Boone said every crew member had \"weird things happen to them\" [clarification needed] Boone wanted to use practical effects as much as possible to make the film feel like the horror movies that he grew up with For example, he had actors push on sheets of spandex to create the effect of figures pushing through the walls of a room, a technique originated by Wes Craven Ten percent of the film used green screen [38] On the film's set, Boone explained that the script had been re-written following the mixed critical response of Apocalypse, so that the plot is set during modern day rather than in the 1980s, which removed Professor X and Storm from the story Boone felt the film was not largely affected by this change since its confined location and lack of technology meant \"it might as well be the 80s in terms of the setting It didn't change our story very much.\" [39]\n\n\nPost-production\nBoone and his regular editors Matthew Rundell and Robb Sullivan delivered a cut of the film to Fox that they were happy with, [43] [44] and it tested as well as initial screenings of Deadpool did Three days of additional photography were planned to complete the \"YA movie\" that Boone, Lee, and Fox had agreed to make However, following the successful release of the film It (2017), the studio cut the first trailer for The New Mutants to focus on the \"scary elements from the film, essentially selling it as a straight-up horror movie\" With the positive reception to the preview, Fox decided to make the film more like Boone's original vision rather than completing the version that they had been making during production [31]\n\n\nInitial cut\nBoone and his regular editors Matthew Rundell and Robb Sullivan delivered a cut of the film to Fox

selling it as a straight-up horror movie\" With the positive reception to the preview, Fox decided to make the film more like Boone's original vision rather than completing the version that they had been making during production [31]\n\n\nPlanned reshoots\nIn January 2018, the film's release date was pushed back to February 22, 2019 [45] This allowed it to avoid Deadpool 2 (2018), which had just been moved to a date that would have had both films in theaters at the same time in certain markets [46] It also allowed time for the reshoots the studio required to make the film more in line with Boone's original vision [31] [47] [48] When asked about this delay the next month, Williams stated that there had been concerns during filming regarding the short turnaround from the end of photography to the previously set release date, especially with the amount of visual effects still needed to finish the film, so in her opinion the delay was \"for the better\" [49] The additional photography was scheduled for mid-2018 It was expected to include the addition of several new characters who would appear throughout the film rather than just making cameo appearances [43] [50]\n\n\nDisney acquisition\nReshoots for the film were slated to begin by the end of September 2018, with Kinberg stating: \"audiences really embraced the notion of a superhero movie or a comic book movie that was, in its core, a horror film\" [55] Following the acquisition of Fox by Disney in March 2019, it was revealed that the additional photography had still not taken place, nor were they \"planned so far\" The work was dependent on Boone's involvement, [56] [57] and decisions being made to instead release the film on one of the streaming services owned by The Walt Disney Company [58] A month later at CinemaCon 2019, Disney confirmed that the film will be released, but indicated that its release date could be adjusted to better fit within Disney's existing schedule [59] A month after that, the studio pushed the film's release back to April 3, 2020, [60] and the reshoots were set to take place later in 2019 Kinberg explained that they had take time to reschedule because the creative team was still deciding what portions of the film to reshoot due to the difficulty of reuniting the cast given their busy schedules [61]\n\n\nFinal cut\nOn March 7, 2020, Boone stated that the film was complete [68] Shortly after, he explained that work on the film had halted when Disney's acquisition of Fox had begun and so no reshoots ever took place on the film, not even standard pickups that had already been scheduled during initial production At the time, around 75 percent of the film had been edited while much of the film's visual effects were also not finished By the time the acquisition was completed, Boone had moved on and was about to begin work on a new television series, The Stand Before he started production on that series, Disney asked Boone if he would return to finish the film [9] Rundell and Sullivan were committed to working on The Stand at that point and could not continue editing The New Mutants, so Boone brought on editor Andrew Buckland to help finish the film [44]\n\n\nMusic\nNate Walcott and Mike Mogis were confirmed in December 2017 to be composing the score for the film, having worked with Boone on his previous films [73] In May 2018, Marilyn Manson announced that his cover of the song \"Cry Little Sister\"—originally written for the film The Lost Boys (1987) by Gerard McMahon—which Manson debuted during his Heaven Upside Down tour, had been recorded specifically for the New Mutants soundtrack, despite appearing in an ad in 2018 for the series Titans and being released as a single in 2018 [74] [75] In February 2020, Mark Snow was revealed to have composed the score for the final version of the film, though additional music composed by Walcott and Mogis was still set to be used in the soundtrack; \"Cry Little Sister\" did not appear on the official soundtrack album [76]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe first trailer for the film was released in October 2017, on Friday the 13th, [77] with a horror focus inspired by the success of the film It, which had been released the month before [31] Sara Vilkomerson of Entertainment Weekly felt that trailer delivered on Boone's promise of a different type of X-Men film and was \"creepy\" Vilkomerson also noted the trailer's use of Pink Floyd's \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\"; [78] the title treatment for the film introduced in the trailer evokes the treatment used for that song [38] Alex McLevy, writing for The A.V Club, also felt that Boone had delivered on his promise of a \"straight-up horror film\" and said, \"Congrats to this creative team for trying something different with the superhero genre.\" [79] Writing for /Film, Hoai-Tran Bui said the film looked like a bottle episode for the X-Men franchise and noted that telling a standalone story led to success for Deadpool Bui also compared the trailer's tone to Stranger Things (in which Heaton also stars as Jonathan Byers) and Braga's performance as Reyes to Nurse Ratched [80] Boone, Lee, Braga, Zaga, and Sienkiewicz promoted the film at a 2017 Comic Con Experience panel, where they also talked about their plans for future films [20]\n\n\nRelease\nThe New Mutants was released in the United States on August 28, 2020 [72] It was originally set to be released on April 13, 2018, [29] before being delayed to February 22, 2019, to avoid Deadpool 2, [51] and then to August 2, 2019, to avoid Dark Phoenix [45] It was delayed to April 3, 2020, by Disney after that studio acquired Fox, [60] and then removed from Disney's schedule in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic [70] Disney rescheduled the film for August 28, 2020, two months later [72] The various delays have led to several online commentators referring to the film as \"cursed\" and lamenting its bad luck [70] [89] [90] Boone and the film's cast acknowledged this curse during the 2020 Comic-Con@Home convention, which included a \"cheeky teaser trailer\" that recounted the film's release dates and ended with a \"Fingers Crossed\" note beside the August 28 date [88] Boone also revealed the various contracts signed for the film guaranteed a theatrical release, preventing it from first being released on either Disney+ or Hulu

Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 36% based on 139 reviews, with an average rating of 4.8/10 The website's critics consensus reads, \"Rendering a list of potentially explosive ingredients mostly inert, The New Mutants is a franchise spinoff that's less than the sum of its super-powered parts.\" [99] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 43 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\" [100]\n\n\nAccolades\nThe New Mutants received a nomination for Best Thriller Poster at the 2018 Golden Trailer Awards [109] The film was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Comic to Motion Picture Release in 2021 [110]\n\n\nComics comparison\n\nThe New Mutants comics co-creator, Bob McLeod, expressed his disappointment with the film for inaccurately depicting the characters: \"I was disappointed when they didn't give Dani braids, although I like Blu Hunt I was disappointed when Rahne wasn't a redhead with spiky hair, although I adore Maisie Williams I was disappointed that Sam isn't tall and gawky, although I do like Charlie Heaton But mainly I was very disappointed that Roberto isn't short and dark-skinned Yet another example of Hollywood white-washing.\" He also criticized the film for misspelling his name in the credits as \"MacLeod\" [111] [112] The spelling was corrected for the home media release [113] Criticism was also directed to Braga, a white Brazilian woman, playing Dr Cecilia Reyes, a black Puerto Rican character [114] McLeod further felt that fitting the film into the horror genre was a mistake and that it most likely would have fared better had it been a straightforward origin film, akin to the graphic novel that he and Chris Claremont created together [115] After his comments went viral, he said he felt bad for Henry Zaga, who plays Sunspot, and told people to calm down and that the movie looked like great fun [116]\n\n\nCancelled sequels\nBoone and Lee originally pitched the film to Kinberg as the first in a trilogy [17] In October 2017, Boone said that the characters Warlock and Karma would appear in the sequels [38] In December, Boone and Lee revealed that they were interested in filming the first sequel in Brazil and that Sunspot's father Emmanuel da Costa would play a role in the franchise [20] Explaining his plans for the sequels, Boone said that he wanted each film in the trilogy to be a different kind of horror movie The first film is a \"'rubber-reality' supernatural horror movie\", [38] the second film would have been an alien invasion film featuring Warlock, and the third film would have been an apocalyptic horror film inspired by the 1989 comic book crossover storyline \"Inferno\" [117] Boone confirmed that the second film would have been set in Brazil and included Antonio Banderas as Emmanuel da Costa Karma was to be introduced as the villain of the sequel but would have joined the New Mutants by the end of the film alongside Warlock Boone added that Emmanuel da Costa's connections to the Hellfire Club would have been explored in the first sequel, and he said the overall tone of that film would still have been inspired by Claremont and Sienkiewicz's run [52] Boone had wanted Sacha Baron Cohen to portray Warlock through motion capture and had discussed the role with Cohen during production on the first film [118]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal

Boone's original vision [31] [47] [48] When asked about this delay the next month, Williams stated that there had been concerns during filming regarding the short turnaround from the end of photography to the previously set release date, especially with the amount of visual effects still needed to finish the film, so in her opinion the delay was \"for the better\" [49] The additional photography was scheduled for mid-2018 It was expected to include the addition of several new characters who would appear throughout the film rather than just making cameo appearances [43] [50]\n\n\nDisney acquisition\nReshoots for the film were slated to begin by the end of September 2018, with Kinberg stating: \"audiences really embraced the notion of a superhero movie or a comic book movie that was, in its core, a horror film\" [55] Following the acquisition of Fox by Disney in March 2019, it was revealed that the additional photography had still not taken place, nor were they \"planned so far\" The work was dependent on Boone's involvement, [56] [57] and decisions being made to instead release the film on one of the streaming services owned by The Walt Disney Company [58] A month later at CinemaCon 2019, Disney confirmed that the film will be released, but indicated that its release date could be adjusted to better fit within Disney's existing schedule [59] A month after that, the studio pushed the film's release back to April 3, 2020, [60] and the reshoots were set to take place later in 2019 Kinberg explained that they had take time to reschedule because the creative team was still deciding what portions of the film to reshoot due to the difficulty of reuniting the cast given their busy schedules [61]\n\n\nFinal cut\nOn March 7, 2020, Boone stated that the film was complete [68] Shortly after, he explained that work on the film had halted when Disney's acquisition of Fox had begun and so no reshoots ever took place on the film, not even standard pickups that had already been scheduled during initial production At the time, around 75 percent of the film had been edited while much of the film's visual effects were also not finished By the time the acquisition was completed, Boone had moved on and was about to begin work on a new television series, The Stand Before he started production on that series, Disney asked Boone if he would return to finish the film [9] Rundell and Sullivan were committed to working on The Stand at that point and could not continue editing The New Mutants, so Boone brought on editor Andrew Buckland to help finish the film [44]\n\n\nMusic\nNate Walcott and Mike Mogis were confirmed in December 2017 to be composing the score for the film, having worked with Boone on his previous films [73] In May 2018, Marilyn Manson announced that his cover of the song \"Cry Little Sister\"—originally written for the film The Lost Boys (1987) by Gerard McMahon—which Manson debuted during his Heaven Upside Down tour, had been recorded specifically for the New Mutants soundtrack, despite appearing in an ad in 2018 for the series Titans and being released as a single in 2018 [74] [75] In February 2020, Mark Snow was revealed to have composed the score for the final version of the film, though additional music composed by Walcott and Mogis was still set to be used in the soundtrack; \"Cry Little Sister\" did not appear on the official soundtrack album [76]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe first trailer for the film was released in October 2017, on Friday the 13th, [77] with a horror focus inspired by the success of the film It, which had been released the month before [31] Sara Vilkomerson of Entertainment Weekly felt that trailer delivered on Boone's promise of a different type of X-Men film and was \"creepy\" Vilkomerson also noted the trailer's use of Pink Floyd's \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\"; [78] the title treatment for the film introduced in the trailer evokes the treatment used for that song [38] Alex McLevy, writing for The A.V Club, also felt that Boone had delivered on his promise of a \"straight-up horror film\" and said, \"Congrats to this creative team for trying something different with the superhero genre.\" [79] Writing for /Film, Hoai-Tran Bui said the film looked like a bottle episode for the X-Men franchise and noted that telling a standalone story led to success for Deadpool Bui also compared the trailer's tone to Stranger Things (in which Heaton also stars as Jonathan Byers) and Braga's performance as Reyes to Nurse Ratched [80] Boone, Lee, Braga, Zaga, and Sienkiewicz promoted the film at a 2017 Comic Con Experience panel, where they also talked about their plans for future films [20]\n\n\nRelease\nThe New Mutants was released in the United States on August 28, 2020 [72] It was originally set to be released on April 13, 2018, [29] before being delayed to February 22, 2019, to avoid Deadpool 2, [51] and then to August 2, 2019, to avoid Dark Phoenix [45] It was delayed to April 3, 2020, by Disney after that studio acquired Fox, [60] and then removed from Disney's schedule in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic [70] Disney rescheduled the film for August 28, 2020, two months later [72] The various delays have led to several online commentators referring to the film as \"cursed\" and lamenting its bad luck [70] [89] [90] Boone and the film's cast acknowledged this curse during the 2020 Comic-Con@Home convention, which included a \"cheeky teaser trailer\" that recounted the film's release dates and ended with a \"Fingers Crossed\" note beside the August 28 date [88] Boone also revealed the various contracts signed for the film guaranteed a theatrical release, preventing it from first being released on either Disney+ or Hulu

Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 36% based on 139 reviews, with an average rating of 4.8/10 The website's critics consensus reads, \"Rendering a list of potentially explosive ingredients mostly inert, The New Mutants is a franchise spinoff that's less than the sum of its super-powered parts.\" [99] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 43 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\" [100]\n\n\nAccolades\nThe New Mutants received a nomination for Best Thriller Poster at the 2018 Golden Trailer Awards [109] The film was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Comic to Motion Picture Release in 2021 [110]\n\n\nComics comparison\n\nThe New Mutants comics co-creator, Bob McLeod, expressed his disappointment with the film for inaccurately depicting the characters: \"I was disappointed when they didn't give Dani braids, although I like Blu Hunt I was disappointed when Rahne wasn't a redhead with spiky hair, although I adore Maisie Williams I was disappointed that Sam isn't tall and gawky, although I do like Charlie Heaton But mainly I was very disappointed that Roberto isn't short and dark-skinned Yet another example of Hollywood white-washing.\" He also criticized the film for misspelling his name in the credits as \"MacLeod\" [111] [112] The spelling was corrected for the home media release [113] Criticism was also directed to Braga, a white Brazilian woman, playing Dr Cecilia Reyes, a black Puerto Rican character [114] McLeod further felt that fitting the film into the horror genre was a mistake and that it most likely would have fared better had it been a straightforward origin film, akin to the graphic novel that he and Chris Claremont created together [115] After his comments went viral, he said he felt bad for Henry Zaga, who plays Sunspot, and told people to calm down and that the movie looked like great fun [116]\n\n\nCancelled sequels\nBoone and Lee originally pitched the film to Kinberg as the first in a trilogy [17] In October 2017, Boone said that the characters Warlock and Karma would appear in the sequels [38] In December, Boone and Lee revealed that they were interested in filming the first sequel in Brazil and that Sunspot's father Emmanuel da Costa would play a role in the franchise [20] Explaining his plans for the sequels, Boone said that he wanted each film in the trilogy to be a different kind of horror movie The first film is a \"'rubber-reality' supernatural horror movie\", [38] the second film would have been an alien invasion film featuring Warlock, and the third film would have been an apocalyptic horror film inspired by the 1989 comic book crossover storyline \"Inferno\" [117] Boone confirmed that the second film would have been set in Brazil and included Antonio Banderas as Emmanuel da Costa Karma was to be introduced as the villain of the sequel but would have joined the New Mutants by the end of the film alongside Warlock Boone added that Emmanuel da Costa's connections to the Hellfire Club would have been explored in the first sequel, and he said the overall tone of that film would still have been inspired by Claremont and Sienkiewicz's run [52] Boone had wanted Sacha Baron Cohen to portray Warlock through motion capture and had discussed the role with Cohen during production on the first film [118]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal

prostitutes [5] He was very religious from an early age and devoted his life entirely to Christianity In continental Europe (more precisely the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, the Czech Republic and Germany), he is usually portrayed as a bearded bishop in canonical robes.\n\n\nFather Christmas\nFather Christmas dates back as far as 16th century in England during the reign of Henry VIII, when he was pictured as a large man in green or scarlet robes lined with fur [10] He typified the spirit of good cheer at Christmas, bringing peace, joy, good food and wine and revelry [10] As England no longer kept the feast day of Saint Nicholas on 6 December, the Father Christmas celebration was moved to 25 December to coincide with Christmas Day [10] The Victorian revival of Christmas included Father Christmas as the emblem of good cheer [11] His physical appearance was variable, [12] with one image being John Leech's illustration of the \"Ghost of Christmas Present\" in Charles Dickens's festive story A Christmas Carol (1843), as a great genial man in a green coat lined with fur who takes Scrooge through the bustling streets of London on the current Christmas morning, sprinkling the essence of Christmas onto the happy populace [10] [11]\n\n\nDutch, Belgian and Swiss folklore\nIn the Netherlands and Belgium, the character of Santa Claus competes with that of Sinterklaas, based on Saint Nicolas Santa Claus is known as de Kerstman in Dutch (\"the Christmas man\") and Père Noël (\"Father Christmas\") in French For children in the Netherlands, Sinterklaas remains the predominant gift-giver in December; 36% of the Dutch only give presents on Sinterklaas evening or the day itself, 6 December, [13] while Christmas, 25 December, is used by another 21% to give presents Some 26% of the Dutch population gives presents on both days [14] In Belgium, presents are offered exclusively to children on 6 December, and on Christmas Day all ages may receive presents Saint Nicolas/Sinterklaas' assistants are called \"Pieten\" (in Dutch) or \"Père Fouettard\" (in French), and they are not elves [15]\n\n\nGermanic paganism, Wodan, and Christianization\nPrior to Christianization, the Germanic peoples (including the English) celebrated a midwinter event called Yule (Old English geola or giuli) [17] With the Christianization of Germanic Europe, numerous traditions were absorbed from Yuletide celebrations into modern Christmas, [18] such as the Wild Hunt, frequently attested as being led by the god Odin (Wodan), bearing (among many names) the names Jólnir, meaning \"Yule figure\", and Langbarðr, meaning \"long-beard\", in Old Norse [19]\n\n\nHistory\nEarly representations of the gift-giver from Church history and folklore, especially St Nicholas, merged with the English character Father Christmas to create the mythical character known to the rest of the English-speaking world as \"Santa Claus\" (a phonetic derivation of \"Sinterklaas\" in Dutch).\n\n\nOrigins\nEarly representations of the gift-giver from Church history and folklore, especially St Nicholas, merged with the English character Father Christmas to create the mythical character known to the rest of the English-speaking world as \"Santa Claus\" (a phonetic derivation of \"Sinterklaas\" in Dutch).\n\n\n19th century\nIn 1821, the book A New-year's present, to the little ones from five to twelve was published in New York It contained \"Old Santeclaus with Much Delight\", an anonymous poem describing Santeclaus on a reindeer sleigh, bringing rewards to children [25] Some modern ideas of Santa Claus seemingly became canon after the anonymous publication of the poem A Visit From St Nicholas (better known today as The Night Before Christmas) in the Troy, New York, Sentinel on 23 December 1823; Clement Clarke Moore later claimed authorship, though some scholars argue that Henry Livingston, Jr (who died nine years before Moore's claim) was the author [5] [26] St Nick is described as being \"chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf\" with \"a little round belly\", that \"shook when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly\", in spite of which the \"miniature sleigh\" and \"tiny reindeer\" still indicate that he is physically diminutive The reindeer were also named: Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Dunder and Blixem (Dunder and Blixem came from the old Dutch words for thunder and lightning, which were later changed to the more German sounding Donner and Blitzen) [27]\n\n\n20th century\nL Frank Baum's The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus, a children's book, was published in 1902 Much of Santa Claus's mythos was not firmly established at the time, leaving Baum to give his \"Neclaus\" (Necile's Little One) a variety of immortal support, a home in the Laughing Valley of Hohaho, and ten reindeer—who could not fly, but leapt in enormous, flight-like bounds Claus's immortality was earned, much like his title (\"Santa\"), decided by a vote of those naturally immortal This work also established Claus's motives: a happy childhood among immortals When Ak, Master Woodsman of the World, exposes him to the misery and poverty of children in the outside world, Santa strives to find a way to bring joy into the lives of all children, and eventually invents toys as a principal means Santa later appears in The Road to Oz as an honored guest at Ozma's birthday party, stated to be famous and beloved enough for everyone to bow even before he is announced as \"The most Mighty and Loyal Friend of Children, His Supreme Highness – Santa Claus\".\n\n\nIn popular culture\nElves had been portrayed as using assembly lines to produce toys early in the 20th century That shift was reflected in the modern depiction of Santa's residence—now often humorously portrayed as a fully mechanized production and distribution facility, equipped with the latest manufacturing technology, and overseen by the elves with Santa and Mrs Claus as executives or managers [44]\n\n\nTraditions and rituals\nThe tradition of Santa Claus being said to enter dwellings through the chimney is shared by many European seasonal gift-givers [52]\n\n\nChimneys\nThe tradition of Santa Claus being said to enter dwellings through the chimney is shared by many European seasonal gift-givers [52]\n\n\nChristmas Eve\nIn the United States and Canada, children may leave a glass of milk and a plate of cookies intended for Santa; in Britain, Australia and New Zealand, sherry or beer, and mince pies are left instead In Denmark, Norway and Sweden, it is common for children to leave him rice porridge with sugar and cinnamon instead In Ireland it is popular to leave Guinness or milk, along with Christmas pudding or mince pies.\n\n\nAppearance\nSanta is generally depicted as a portly, jolly, white-bearded man, often with spectacles, wearing a red outfit consisting of jacket, trousers and hat all trimmed with white fur, accessorized with black leather belt and boots, and carrying a bag full of gifts for children The 1823 poem \"A Visit from St Nicholas\" popularized this image in North America during the 19th century Caricaturist and political cartoonist Thomas Nast also played a role in the creation of Santa's image [57] [58] [59]\n\n\nLaugh\n\n\n\nHome\nSanta Claus's home is traditionally said to include a residence and a workshop where he is said to create—often with the aid of elves or other supernatural beings—the gifts he is said to deliver to good children at Christmas Some stories and legends include a village, inhabited by his helpers, surrounding his home and shop.\n\n\nParades, department stores, and shopping malls\nActors portraying Santa Claus are present at various venues in the weeks leading up to Christmas A concept devised by retail entrepreneur David Lewis, the first Christmas grotto opened in Lewis's department store in Liverpool, England in 1879 [69] The idea then took hold throughout the UK, [70] before extending to Australian and American department stores in the 1890s, with James Edgar starting in 1890 in his Brockton, Massachusetts department store [71] Having a Santa actor set up to take pictures with children is a ritual that dates back at least to 1918 [72] An area is often set aside for the actors portraying Santa to use for the duration of the holiday

to children during the Christmas season. The modern image of Santa Claus is based on the historical figure of Saint Nicholas, a 4th-century bishop known for his generosity and kindness, especially towards children.\n\n**Predecessor figures**\n\nSaint Nicholas was a 4th-century Greek Christian bishop of Myra (now Demre) in the region of Lycia in the Roman Empire, today in Turkey. Nicholas was known for his generous gifts to the poor, in particular presenting the three impoverished daughters of a pious Christian with dowries so that they would not have to become prostitutes. He was very religious from an early age and devoted his life entirely to Christianity. In continental Europe (more precisely the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, the Czech Republic, and Germany), he is usually portrayed as a bearded bishop in canonical robes.\n\n**Father Christmas**\n\nFather Christmas dates back as far as the 16th century in England during the reign of Henry VIII, when he was pictured as a large man in green or scarlet robes lined with fur. He typified the spirit of good cheer at Christmas, bringing peace, joy, good food and wine, and revelry. As England no longer kept the feast day of Saint Nicholas on 6 December, the Father Christmas celebration was moved to 25 December to coincide with Christmas Day. The Victorian revival of Christmas included Father Christmas as the emblem of good cheer. His physical appearance was variable, with one image being John Leech's illustration of the \"Ghost of Christmas Present\" in Charles Dickens's festive story A Christmas Carol (1843), as a great genial man in a green coat lined with fur who takes Scrooge through the bustling streets of London on the current Christmas morning, sprinkling the essence of Christmas onto the happy populace.\n\n**Dutch, Belgian, and Swiss folklore**\n\nIn the Netherlands and Belgium, the character of Santa Claus competes with that of Sinterklaas, based on Saint Nicolas. Santa Claus is known as de Kerstman in Dutch (\"the Christmas man\") and Père Noël (\"Father Christmas\") in French. For children in the Netherlands, Sinterklaas remains the predominant gift-giver in December; 36% of the Dutch only give presents on Sinterklaas evening or the day itself, 6 December, while Christmas, 25 December, is used by another 21% to give presents. Some 26% of the Dutch population gives presents on both days. In Belgium, presents are offered exclusively to children on 6 December, and on Christmas Day all ages may receive presents. Saint Nicolas/Sinterklaas's assistants are called \"Pieten\" (in Dutch) or \"Père Fouettard\" (in French), and they are not elves.\n\n**Germanic paganism, Wodan, and Christianization**\n\nPrior to Christianization, the Germanic peoples (including the English) celebrated a midwinter event called Yule (Old English geola or giuli). With the Christianization of Germanic Europe, numerous traditions were absorbed from Yuletide celebrations into modern Christmas, such as the Wild Hunt, frequently attested as being led by the god Odin (Wodan), bearing (among many names) the names Jólnir, meaning \"Yule figure\", and Langbarðr, meaning \"long-beard\", in Old Norse.\n\n**History**\n\nEarly representations of the gift-giver from Church history and folklore, especially St Nicholas, merged with the English character Father Christmas to create the mythical character known to the rest of the English-speaking world as \"Santa Claus\" (a phonetic derivation of \"Sinterklaas\" in Dutch). The 19th century saw the development of the modern image of Santa Claus, with the publication of Clement Clarke Moore's poem \"A Visit from St Nicholas\" (also known as \"The Night Before Christmas\") in 1823.\n\n**19th century**\n\nIn 1821, the book A New-year's present, to the little ones from five to twelve was published in New York. It contained \"Old Santeclaus with Much Delight\", an anonymous poem describing Santeclaus on a reindeer sleigh, bringing rewards to children. Some modern ideas of Santa Claus seemingly became canon after the anonymous publication of the poem A Visit From St Nicholas (better known today as The Night Before Christmas) in the Troy, New York, Sentinel on 23 December 1823; Clement Clarke Moore later claimed authorship, though some scholars argue that Henry Livingston, Jr (who died nine years before Moore's claim) was the author. St Nick is described as being \"chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf\" with \"a little round belly\", that \"shook when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly\", in spite of which the \"miniature sleigh\" and \"tiny reindeer\" still indicate that he is physically diminutive. The reindeer were also named: Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Dunder and Blixem (Dunder and Blixem came from the old Dutch words for thunder and lightning, which were later changed to the more German sounding Donner and Blitzen).\n\n**20th century**\n\nL Frank Baum's The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus, a children's book, was published in 1902. Much of Santa Claus's mythos was not firmly established at the time, leaving Baum to give his \"Neclaus\" (Necile's Little One) a variety of immortal support, a home in the Laughing Valley of Hohaho, and ten reindeer—who could not fly, but leapt in enormous, flight-like bounds. Claus's immortality was earned, much like his title (\"Santa\"), decided by a vote of those naturally immortal. This work also established Claus's motives: a happy childhood among immortals. When Ak, Master Woodsman of the World, exposes him to the misery and poverty of children in the outside world, Santa strives to find a way to bring joy into the lives of all children, and eventually invents toys as a principal means. Santa later appears in The Road to Oz as an honored guest at Ozma's birthday party, stated to be famous and beloved enough for everyone to bow even before he is announced as \"The most Mighty and Loyal Friend of Children, His Supreme Highness – Santa Claus\".\n\n**In popular culture**\n\nElves had been portrayed as using assembly lines to produce toys early in the 20th century. That shift was reflected in the modern depiction of Santa's residence—now often humorously portrayed as a fully mechanized production and distribution facility, equipped with the latest manufacturing technology, and overseen by the elves with Santa and Mrs Claus as executives or managers.\n\n**Traditions and rituals**\n\nThe tradition of Santa Claus being said to enter dwellings through the chimney is shared by many European seasonal gift-givers. In the United States and Canada, children may leave a glass of milk and a plate of cookies intended for Santa; in Britain, Australia, and New Zealand, sherry or beer, and mince pies are left instead. In Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, it is common for children to leave him rice porridge with sugar and cinnamon instead. In Ireland, it is popular to leave Guinness or milk, along with Christmas pudding or mince pies.\n\n**Appearance**\n\nSanta is generally depicted as a portly, jolly, white-bearded man, often with spectacles, wearing a red outfit consisting of jacket, trousers, and hat all trimmed with white fur, accessorized with a black leather belt and boots, and carrying a bag full of gifts for children. The 1823 poem \"A Visit from St Nicholas\" popularized this image in North America during the 19th century. Caricaturist and political cartoonist Thomas Nast also played a role in the creation of Santa's image.\n\n**Home**\n\nSanta Claus's home is traditionally said to include a residence and a workshop where he is said to create—often with the aid of elves or other supernatural beings—the gifts he is said to deliver to good children at Christmas. Some stories and legends include a village, inhabited by his helpers, surrounding his home and shop.\n\n**Parades, department stores, and shopping malls**\n\nActors portraying Santa Claus are present at various venues in the weeks leading up to Christmas. A concept devised by retail entrepreneur David Lewis, the first Christmas grotto opened in Lewis's department store in Liverpool, England in 1879. The idea then took hold throughout the UK, before extending to Australian and American department stores in the 1890s, with James Edgar starting in 1890 in his Brockton, Massachusetts department store. Having a Santa actor set up to take pictures with children is a ritual that dates back at least to 1918. An area is often set aside for the actors portraying Santa to use for the duration of the holiday season. It usually features a chair for the actors to sit in surrounded by various holiday-themed decorations.\n\n**Letter writing**\n\nChildren sometimes write letters to Santa Claus, often with a wish list of presents that they wish to receive. Some postal services recognize this tradition, and may accept letters addressed to \"Santa Claus\". Writing letters to Santa Claus has the educational benefits of promoting literacy, computer literacy, and e-mail literacy. A letter to Santa is often a child's first experience of correspondence, written and sent with the help of a parent or teacher, children learn about the structure of a letter, salutations, and the use of an address and postcode.\n\n**Tracking**\n\nA number of websites have been created by various organizations that have claimed to track Santa Claus's yearly journey. Some, such as NORAD Tracks Santa, the Google Santa Tracker, the emailSanta.com Tracker, and the Santa Update Project, have endured.\n\n**Criticism**\n\nSanta Claus has partial Christian roots in Saint Nicholas, particularly in the high church denominations that practice the veneration of him and other saints. Various Christian denominations have differing opinions on Santa Claus, ranging from acceptance to denouncement. Some Christians, particularly Calvinists such as the Puritans, disliked the idea of Santa Claus as well as Christmas in general, believing that the lavish celebrations were not in accordance with their faith.

concepts, which would have an enduring influence on later Burmese culture and political organisation [67]\n\n\nPagan Kingdom\nPagan gradually grew to absorb its surrounding states until the 1050s–1060s when Anawrahta founded the Pagan Kingdom, the first ever unification of the Irrawaddy valley and its periphery In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Pagan Empire and the Khmer Empire were two main powers in mainland Southeast Asia [69] The Burmese language and culture gradually became dominant in the upper Irrawaddy valley, eclipsing the Pyu, Mon and Pali norms [clarification needed] by the late 12th century [70] Theravada Buddhism slowly began to spread to the village level, although Tantric, Mahayana, Hinduism, and folk religion remained heavily entrenched Pagan's rulers and wealthy built over 10,000 Buddhist temples in the Pagan capital zone alone Repeated Mongol invasions in the late 13th century toppled the four-century-old kingdom in 1287 [70]\n\n\nTaungoo and Konbaung\nPolitical unification returned in the mid-16th century, through the efforts of Taungoo, a former vassal state of Ava Taungoo's young, ambitious King Tabinshwehti defeated the more powerful Hanthawaddy in the Toungoo–Hanthawaddy War His successor Bayinnaung went on to conquer a vast swath of mainland Southeast Asia including the Shan states, Lan Na, Manipur, Mong Mao, the Ayutthaya Kingdom, Lan Xang and southern Arakan However, the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia unravelled soon after Bayinnaung's death in 1581, completely collapsing by 1599 Ayutthaya seized Tenasserim and Lan Na, and Portuguese mercenaries established Portuguese rule at Thanlyin (Syriam).\n\n\nBritish Burma (1885–1948)\nIn the 19th century, Burmese rulers sought to maintain their traditional influence in the western areas of Assam, Manipur and Arakan Pressing them, however, was the British East India Company, which was expanding its interests eastwards over the same territory Over the next 60 years, diplomacy, raids, treaties and compromises, known collectively as the Anglo-Burmese Wars, continued until Britain proclaimed control over most of Burma [77] With the fall of Mandalay, all of Burma came under British rule, being annexed on 1 January 1886.\n\n\nIndependence (1948–1962)\nOn 4 January 1948, the nation became an independent republic, under the terms of the Burma Independence Act 1947 The new country was named the Union of Burma, with Sao Shwe Thaik as its first president and U Nu as its first prime minister Unlike most other former British colonies and overseas territories, Burma did not become a member of the Commonwealth A bicameral parliament was formed, consisting of a Chamber of Deputies and a Chamber of Nationalities, [87] and multi-party elections were held in 1951–1952, 1956 and 1960.\n\n\nMilitary rule (1962–2011)\nOn 2 March 1962, the military led by General Ne Win took control of Burma through a coup d'état, and the government had been under direct or indirect control by the military since then Between 1962 and 1974, Myanmar was ruled by a revolutionary council headed by the general Almost all aspects of society (business, media, production) were nationalised or brought under government control under the Burmese Way to Socialism, [91] which combined Soviet-style nationalisation and central planning.\n\n\nCivil wars\nCivil wars have been a constant feature of Myanmar's socio-political landscape since the attainment of independence in 1948 These wars are predominantly struggles for ethnic and sub-national autonomy, with the areas surrounding the ethnically Bamar central districts of the country serving as the primary geographical setting of conflict Foreign journalists and visitors require a special travel permit to visit the areas in which Myanmar's civil wars continue [108]\n\n\nPeriod of liberalisation, 2011–2021\nThe military-backed Government had promulgated a \"Roadmap to Discipline-flourishing Democracy\" in 1993, but the process appeared to stall several times, until 2008 when the Government published a new draft national constitution, and organised a (flawed) national referendum which adopted it The new constitution provided for election of a national assembly with powers to appoint a president, while practically ensuring army control at all levels [119]\n\n\n2015 general elections\nGeneral elections were held on 8 November 2015 These were the first openly contested elections held in Myanmar since the 1990 general election (which was annulled [129]) The results gave the NLD an absolute majority of seats in both chambers of the national parliament, enough to ensure that its candidate would become president, while NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi is constitutionally barred from the presidency [129] [130]\n\n\nCoup d'état and civil war\nIn Myanmar's 2020 parliamentary election, the ostensibly ruling National League for Democracy (NLD), the party of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, competed with various other smaller parties – particularly the military-affiliated Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) [134] Suu Kyi's NLD won the 2020 Myanmar general election on 8 November in a landslide [134] [135] [136] The USDP, regarded as a proxy for the military, suffered a \"humiliating\" defeat [137] [138] – even worse than in 2015 [138] – capturing only 33 of the 476 elected seats [136] [137]\n\n\nGeography\nMyanmar has a total area of 678,500 square kilometres (262,000 sq mi) It lies between latitudes 9° and 29°N, and longitudes 92° and 102°E Myanmar is bordered in the northwest by the Chittagong Division of Bangladesh and the Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh states of India Its north and northeast border is with the Tibet Autonomous Region and Yunnan for a Sino-Myanmar border total of 2,185 km (1,358 mi) It is bounded by Laos and Thailand to the southeast Myanmar has 1,930 km (1,200 mi) of contiguous coastline along the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea to the southwest and the south, which forms one quarter of its total perimeter [19]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nMyanmar is divided into seven states (ပြည်နယ်) and seven regions (တိုင်းဒေသကြီး), formerly called divisions [162] Regions are predominantly Bamar (that is, mainly inhabited by Myanmar's dominant ethnic group) States, in essence, are regions that are home to particular ethnic minorities The administrative divisions are further subdivided into districts, which are further subdivided into townships, wards, and villages.\n\n\nClimate\nMuch of the country lies between the Tropic of Cancer and the Equator It lies in the monsoon region of Asia, with its coastal regions receiving over 5,000 mm (196.9 in) of rain annually Annual rainfall in the delta region is approximately 2,500 mm (98.4 in), while average annual rainfall in the dry zone in central Myanmar is less than 1,000 mm (39.4 in) The northern regions of Myanmar are the coolest, with average temperatures of 21 °C (70 °F) Coastal and delta regions have an average maximum temperature of 32 °C (89.6 °F) [161]\nPreviously and currently analysed data, as well as future projections on changes caused by climate change predict serious consequences to development for all economic, productive, social, and environmental sectors in Myanmar [164] In order to combat the hardships ahead and do its part to help combat climate change Myanmar has displayed interest in expanding its use of renewable energy and lowering its level of carbon emissions Groups involved in helping Myanmar with the transition and move forward include the UN Environment Programme, Myanmar Climate Change Alliance, and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation which directed in producing the final draft of the Myanmar national climate change policy that was presented to various sectors of the Myanmar government for review [165]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nMyanmar is a biodiverse country with more than 16,000 plant, 314 mammal, 1131 bird, 293 reptile, and 139 amphibian species, and 64 terrestrial ecosystems including tropical and subtropical vegetation, seasonally inundated wetlands, shoreline and tidal systems, and alpine ecosystems Myanmar houses some of the largest intact natural ecosystems in Southeast Asia, but the remaining ecosystems are under threat from land use intensification and over-exploitation According to the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems categories and criteria more than a third of Myanmar's land area has been converted to anthropogenic ecosystems over the last 2–3 centuries, and nearly half of its ecosystems are threatened Despite large gaps in information for some ecosystems, there is a large potential to develop a comprehensive protected area network that protects its terrestrial biodiversity [168]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nMyanmar operates de jure as a unitary assembly-independent republic under its 2008 constitution But in February 2021, the civilian government led by Aung San Suu Kyi, was deposed by the Tatmadaw In February 2021, Myanmar military declared a one-year state emergency and First Vice President Myint Swe became the Acting President of Myanmar and handed the power to the Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Min Aung Hlaing and he assumed the role Chairman of the State Administration Council, then Prime Minister The President of Myanmar acts as the de jure head of state and the Chairman of the State Administration Council acts as the de facto head of government [176]\n\n\nPolitical culture\nThe major political parties are the National League for Democracy and the Union Solidarity and Development Party.\n\n\nForeign relations\nThough the country's foreign relations, particularly with Western nations, have historically been strained, the situation has markedly improved since the reforms following the 2010 elections After years of diplomatic isolation and economic and military sanctions, [184] the United States relaxed curbs on foreign aid to Myanmar in November 2011 [125] and announced the resumption of diplomatic relations on 13 January 2012 [185] The European Union has placed sanctions on Myanmar, including an arms embargo, cessation of trade preferences, and suspension of all aid with the exception of humanitarian aid [186]\n\n\nMilitary\nSince the late 1950s, Myanmar's military has had major roles in Myanmar's politics [198]: 23 \n\nHuman rights and internal conflicts\nThere is consensus that the former military regime in Myanmar (1962–2010) was one of the world's most repressive and abusive regimes [215] [216] In November 2012, Samantha Power, Barack Obama's Special Assistant to the President on Human Rights, wrote on the White House blog that \"Serious human rights abuses against civilians in several regions continue, including against women and children.\" [112] Members of the United Nations and major international human rights organisations have issued repeated and consistent reports of widespread and systematic human rights violations in Myanmar The United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly [217] called on the Burmese military junta to respect human rights and in November 2009 the General Assembly adopted a resolution \"strongly condemning the ongoing systematic violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms\" and calling on the Burmese military regime \"to take urgent measures to put an end to violations of international human rights and humanitarian law.\" [218]\n\n\nChild soldiers\nChild soldiers were reported in 2012 to have played a major part in the Burmese Army [228] The Independent reported in June 2012 that \"Children are being sold as conscripts into the Burmese military for as little as $40 and a bag of rice or a can of petrol.\" [229] In September 2012, the Myanmar Armed Forces released 42 child soldiers, and the International Labour Organization met with representatives of the government as well as the Kachin Independence Army to secure the release of more child soldiers [230]\n\n\nSlavery and human trafficking\nForced labour and human trafficking are common in Myanmar [231] Human trafficking happens mostly to women who are unemployed and have low incomes They are deceived by brokers that better opportunities and wages exist for them abroad [232] In 2017, the government reported 185 trafficking cases The government of Burma makes little effort to eliminate human trafficking The U.S State Department reported that both the government and Tatmadaw were complicit in sex and labour trafficking [233] Women and girls from all ethnic groups and foreigners have been victims of sex trafficking in Myanmar [228] They are forced into prostitution, marriages or pregnancies [234] [235] Sex trafficking in Myanmar has been fuelled by factors like internal conflict, political instability, land confiscation, [236] poor border management, [237] [238] and government restrictions on providing travel documents [234]\n\n\nGenocide allegations and crimes against Rohingya people\nThe Rohingya people have consistently faced human rights abuses by the Burmese regime that has refused to acknowledge them as Burmese citizens (despite some of them having lived in Burma for over three generations)—the Rohingya have been denied Burmese citizenship since the enactment of a 1982 citizenship law [243] The Burmese regime has attempted to forcibly expel Rohingya and bring in non-Rohingyas to replace them [244]—this policy has resulted in the expulsion of approximately half of the 800,000 [245] Rohingya from Burma, while the Rohingya people have been described as \"among the world's least wanted\" [246] and \"one of the world's most persecuted minorities.\" [244] [247] [248]\n\n\nOrgan trading\nThe military forces took over Myanmar in 2021 A yearlong investigation conducted by CNN reveals that half of Myanmar's 54 million population lives below poverty line This drives many of them to the extreme measures such as online organ trade This illegal action of selling their personal organs can earn them a payment equal to a two-year salary Many advertise the organ they wish to donate on social media, this is a endless cycle as families time and again find themselves online to trade their organs as money runs out [252]  \n\n\nGovernment reforms\nAccording to the Crisis Group, [253] since Myanmar transitioned to a new government in August 2011, the country's human rights record has been improving Previously giving Myanmar its lowest rating of 7, the 2012 Freedom in the World report also notes improvement, giving Myanmar a 6 for improvements in civil liberties and political rights, the release of political prisoners, and a loosening of restrictions [254] In 2013, Myanmar improved yet again, receiving a score of 5 in civil liberties and 6 in political freedoms [255]\n\n\nEconomy\nMyanmar's economy is one of the fastest growing economies in the world with a nominal GDP of US$76.09 billion in 2019 and an estimated purchasing power adjusted GDP of US$327.629 billion in 2017 according to the World Bank [267] [improper synthesis?] Foreigners are able to legally lease but not own property [268] In December 2014, Myanmar set up its first stock exchange, the Yangon Stock Exchange [269]\n\n\nEconomic history\nUnder the British administration, the people of Burma were at the bottom of the social hierarchy, with Europeans at the top, Indians, Chinese, and Christianized minorities in the middle, and Buddhist Burmese at the bottom [283] Forcefully integrated into the world economy, Burma's economy grew by involving itself with extractive industries and cash crop agriculture However, much of the wealth was concentrated in the hands of Europeans The country became the world's largest exporter of rice, mainly to European markets, while other colonies like India suffered mass starvation [284] Being a follower of free market principles, the British opened up the country to large-scale immigration with Rangoon exceeding New York City as the greatest immigration port in the world in the 1920s Historian Thant Myint-U states, \"This was out of a total population of only 13 million; it was equivalent to the United Kingdom today taking 2 million people a year.\" By then, in most of Burma's largest cities, Rangoon, Akyab, Bassein and Moulmein, the Indian immigrants formed a majority of the population The Burmese under British rule felt helpless, and reacted with a \"racism that combined feelings of superiority and fear\" [283]\n\n\nAgriculture\nThe major agricultural product is rice, which covers about 60% of the country's total cultivated land area Rice accounts for 97% of total food grain production by weight Through collaboration with the International Rice Research Institute, 52 modern rice varieties were released in the country between 1966 and 1997, helping increase national rice production to 14 million tons in 1987 and to 19 million tons in 1996 By 1988, modern varieties were planted on half of the country's ricelands, including 98 percent of the irrigated areas [290] In 2008 rice production was estimated at 50 million tons [291]\n\n\nExtractive industries\nMyanmar produces precious stones such as rubies, sapphires, pearls, and jade Rubies are the biggest earner; 90% of the world's rubies come from the country, whose red stones are prized for their purity and hue Thailand buys the majority of the country's gems Myanmar's \"Valley of Rubies\", the mountainous Mogok area, 200 km (120 mi) north of Mandalay, is noted for its rare pigeon's blood rubies and blue sapphires [292]\n\n\nTourism\nThe government receives a significant percentage of the income of private-sector tourism services [299] The most popular available tourist destinations in Myanmar include big cities such as Yangon and Mandalay; religious sites in Mon State, Pindaya, Bago and Hpa-An; nature trails in Inle Lake, Kengtung, Putao, Pyin Oo Lwin; ancient cities such as Bagan and Mrauk-U; as well as beaches in Nabule, [300] Ngapali, Ngwe-Saung, and Mergui [301] Nevertheless, much of the country is off-limits to tourists, and interactions between foreigners and the people of Myanmar, particularly in the border regions, are subject to police scrutiny They are not to discuss politics with foreigners, under penalty of imprisonment and, in 2001, the Myanmar Tourism Promotion Board issued an order for local officials to protect tourists and limit \"unnecessary contact\" between foreigners and ordinary Burmese people [302]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe provisional results of the 2014 Myanmar Census showed that the total population was 51,419,420 [308] This figure includes an estimated 1,206,353 persons in parts of northern Rakhine State, Kachin State and Kayin State who were not counted [309] People who were out of the country at the time of the census are not included in these figures There are over 600,000 registered migrant workers from Myanmar in Thailand, and millions more work illegally Burmese citizens account for 80% of all migrant workers in Thailand [310] At the beginning of the 20th century, Burma's population was approximately 10 million [311] The national population density is 76 per square kilometre (200/sq mi), among the lowest in Southeast Asia.\n\n\nLargest cities\nMyanmar is ethnically diverse The government recognises 135 distinct ethnic groups There are at least 108 different ethnolinguistic groups in Myanmar, consisting mainly of distinct Tibeto-Burman peoples, but with sizeable populations of Tai–Kadai, Hmong–Mien, and Austroasiatic (Mon–Khmer) peoples [316]\n\n\nEthnic groups\nMyanmar is ethnically diverse The government recognises 135 distinct ethnic groups There are at least 108 different ethnolinguistic groups in Myanmar, consisting mainly of distinct Tibeto-Burman peoples, but with sizeable populations of Tai–Kadai, Hmong–Mien, and Austroasiatic (Mon–Khmer) peoples [316]\n\n\nLanguages\nMyanmar is home to four major language families: Sino-Tibetan, Tai–Kadai, Austroasiatic, and Indo-European [330] Sino-Tibetan languages are most widely spoken They include Burmese, Karen, Kachin, Chin, and Chinese (mainly Hokkien) The primary Tai–Kadai language is Shan Mon, Palaung, and Wa are the major Austroasiatic languages spoken in Myanmar The two major Indo-European languages are Pali, the liturgical language of Theravada Buddhism, and English [331] More than a hundred languages are spoken in total Since many of them are known only within small tribes around the country, they may have been lost (many if not all) after a few generations.\n\n\nReligion\nMany religions are practised in Myanmar Religious edifices and orders have been in existence for many years The Christian and Muslim populations do, however, face religious persecution and it is hard, if not impossible, for non-Buddhists to join the army or get government jobs, the main route to success in the country [333] Such persecution and targeting of civilians is particularly notable in eastern Myanmar, where over 3,000 villages have been destroyed in the past ten years [334] [335] [336] More than 200,000 Muslims have fled to Bangladesh by 2007 to escape persecution [337] [338]\n\n\nHealth\nThe general state of health care in Myanmar is poor The government spends anywhere from 0.5% to 3% of the country's GDP on health care, consistently ranking among the lowest in the world [352] [353] Although health care is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals Public hospitals lack many of the basic facilities and equipment The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Myanmar is 240 This is compared with 219.3 in 2008 and 662 in 1990 The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 73 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 47 According to Doctors without Borders, 25,000 Burmese AIDS patients died in 2007, deaths that could largely have been prevented by antiretroviral therapy drugs and proper treatment [354]\n\n\nEducation\nAccording to the UNESCO Institute of Statistics, Myanmar's official literacy rate as of 2000 was 90% [358] Historically, Myanmar has had high literacy rates The educational system of Myanmar is operated by the government agency, the Ministry of Education The education system is based on the United Kingdom's system after nearly a century of British and Christian presences in Myanmar Nearly all schools are government-operated, but there has been an increase in privately funded English language schools in the early 21st century Schooling is compulsory until the end of elementary school, approximately 9 years old, while the compulsory schooling age is 15 or 16 at international level.\n\n\nCrime\nMyanmar had a murder rate of 15.2 per 100,000 population with a total of 8,044 murders in 2012 [361] Factors influencing Myanmar's high murder rate include communal violence and armed conflict [362] Myanmar is one of the world's most corrupt nations The 2012 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index ranked the country at number 171, out of 176 countries in total [363] Myanmar is the world's second largest producer of opium after Afghanistan, producing some 25% of the world's opium, and forms part of the Golden Triangle The opium industry was a monopoly during colonial times and has since been illegally operated by corrupt officials in the Burmese military and rebel fighters, [364] primarily as the basis for heroin manufacture Myanmar is the largest producer of methamphetamines in the world, with the majority of Ya ba found in Thailand produced in Myanmar, particularly in the Golden Triangle and northeastern Shan State, which borders Thailand, Laos and China [365] Burmese-produced ya ba is typically trafficked to Thailand via Laos, before being transported through the northeastern Thai region of Isan [366]\n\n\nCulture\nA diverse range of indigenous cultures exist in Myanmar, with majority culture primarily Buddhist and Bamar Bamar culture has been influenced by the cultures of neighbouring countries, manifested in its language, cuisine, music, dance and theatre The arts, particularly literature, have historically been influenced by the local form of Theravada Buddhism Considered the national epic of Myanmar, the Yama Zatdaw, an adaptation of India's Ramayana, has been influenced greatly by Thai, Mon, and Indian versions of the play [367] Buddhism is practised along with nat worship, which involves elaborate rituals to propitiate one from a pantheon of 37 nats [368] [369]\n\n\nCuisine\nBurmese cuisine is characterised by extensive use of fish products such as fish sauce, ngapi (fermented seafood) and dried prawn Mohinga is the traditional breakfast dish and is Myanmar's national dish Seafood is a common ingredient in coastal cities, while meat and poultry are more commonly used in landlocked cities like Mandalay Freshwater fish and shrimp have been incorporated into inland cooking as a primary source of protein and are used in a variety of ways, fresh, salted whole or filleted, salted and dried, made into a salty paste, or fermented sour and pressed Burmese cuisine also includes a variety of salads (a thoke), centred on one major ingredient, ranging from starches like rice, wheat and rice noodles, glass noodles and vermicelli, to potato, ginger, tomato, kaffir lime, long bean, and lahpet (pickled tea leaves).\n\n\nSport\nThe Lethwei, Bando, Banshay, and Pongyi thaing martial arts and chinlone are traditional sports in Myanmar [375] Football is played all over the country, even in villages, and its national team is ruled by the Myanmar Football Federation The 2013 Southeast Asian Games took place in Naypyidaw, Yangon, Mandalay and Ngwesaung Beach in December representing the third occasion that the event has been staged in Myanmar Myanmar previously hosted the games in 1961 and 1969 [376]\n\n\nArt\nBurmese traditional art concepts are popular and respected by the Burmese people and people from abroad Burmese contemporary art has developed quite rapidly on its own terms Artists born after the 1980s have had greater chances of art practice outside the country.\n\n\nMedia and communications\nBecause of Myanmar's political climate, there are not many media companies in relation to the country's population Some are privately owned All programming must meet with the approval of the censorship board The Burmese government announced on 20 August 2012 that it would stop censoring media before publication Following the announcement, newspapers and other outlets no longer required approved by state censors; however, journalists in the country can still face consequences for what they write and say [377] In April 2013, international media reports were published to relay the enactment of the media liberalisation reforms that we announced in August 2012 For the first time in numerous decades, the publication of privately owned newspapers commenced in the country [378]\n\n\nInternet\nInternet use is estimated to be relatively low compared to other countries [379] [380] Myanmar's internet used to be subject to censorship, and authorities viewed e-mails and posts on Internet blogs until 2012 when the government removed media censorship During the strict censorship days, activity at internet cafes was regulated, and one blogger named Zarganar was sentenced to prison for publishing a video of destruction caused by Cyclone Nargis in 2008; Zarganar was released in October 2011.\n\n\nFilm\nMyanmar's first film was a documentary of the funeral of Tun Shein—a leading politician of the 1910s, who campaigned for Burmese independence in London The first Burmese silent film Myitta Ne Thuya (Love and Liquor) in 1920 which proved a major success, despite its poor quality During the 1920s and 1930s, many Burmese-owned film companies made and produced several films The first Burmese sound film was produced in 1932 in Bombay, India with the title Ngwe Pay Lo Ma Ya (Money Can't Buy It) After World War II, Burmese cinema continued to address political themes Many of the films produced in the early Cold War era had a strong propaganda element.\n\n\nSee also\nGovernment\n\n\nNotes\nGovernment\n\n\nPronunciations of

Southeast Asia. Its name has been a matter of dispute and disagreement, particularly in the early 21st century, focusing mainly on the political legitimacy of those using Myanmar versus Burma.\n\n# Etymology\n\nThe name of the country has been a matter of dispute and disagreement, particularly in the early 21st century, focusing mainly on the political legitimacy of those using Myanmar versus Burma. Both names derive from the earlier Burmese Mranma or Mramma, an ethnonym for the majority Burman ethnic group, of uncertain etymology. The terms are also popularly thought to derive from Sanskrit Brahma Desha, 'land of Brahma'.\n\n# History\n\nArchaeological evidence shows that Homo erectus lived in the region now known as Myanmar as early as 750,000 years ago, with no more erectus finds after 75,000 years ago. The first evidence of Homo sapiens is dated to about 25,000 BP with discoveries of stone tools in central Myanmar. Evidence of Neolithic age domestication of plants and animals and the use of polished stone tools dating to sometime between 10,000 and 6,000 BCE has been discovered in the form of cave paintings in Padah-Lin Caves.\n\n## Early city-states\n\nAround the second century BCE the first-known city-states emerged in central Myanmar. The city-states were founded as part of the southward migration by the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu people, the earliest inhabitants of Myanmar of whom records are extant, from present-day Yunnan. The Pyu culture was heavily influenced by trade with India, importing Buddhism as well as other cultural, architectural and political concepts, which would have an enduring influence on later Burmese culture and political organisation.\n\n## Pagan Kingdom\n\nPagan gradually grew to absorb its surrounding states until the 1050s–1060s when Anawrahta founded the Pagan Kingdom, the first ever unification of the Irrawaddy valley and its periphery. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Pagan Empire and the Khmer Empire were two main powers in mainland Southeast Asia. The Burmese language and culture gradually became dominant in the upper Irrawaddy valley, eclipsing the Pyu, Mon and Pali norms by the late 12th century. Theravada Buddhism slowly began to spread to the village level, although Tantric, Mahayana, Hinduism, and folk religion remained heavily entrenched. Pagan's rulers and wealthy built over 10,000 Buddhist temples in the Pagan capital zone alone. Repeated Mongol invasions in the late 13th century toppled the four-century-old kingdom in 1287.\n\n## Taungoo and Konbaung\n\nPolitical unification returned in the mid-16th century, through the efforts of Taungoo, a former vassal state of Ava. Taungoo's young, ambitious King Tabinshwehti defeated the more powerful Hanthawaddy in the Toungoo–Hanthawaddy War. His successor Bayinnaung went on to conquer a vast swath of mainland Southeast Asia including the Shan states, Lan Na, Manipur, Mong Mao, the Ayutthaya Kingdom, Lan Xang and southern Arakan. However, the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia unravelled soon after Bayinnaung's death in 1581, completely collapsing by 1599. Ayutthaya seized Tenasserim and Lan Na, and Portuguese mercenaries established Portuguese rule at Thanlyin (Syriam).\n\n## British Burma (1885–1948)\n\nIn the 19th century, Burmese rulers sought to maintain their traditional influence in the western areas of Assam, Manipur and Arakan. Pressing them, however, was the British East India Company, which was expanding its interests eastwards over the same territory. Over the next 60 years, diplomacy, raids, treaties and compromises, known collectively as the Anglo-Burmese Wars, continued until Britain proclaimed control over most of Burma. With the fall of Mandalay, all of Burma came under British rule, being annexed on 1 January 1886.\n\n## Independence (1948–1962)\n\nOn 4 January 1948, the nation became an independent republic, under the terms of the Burma Independence Act 1947. The new country was named the Union of Burma, with Sao Shwe Thaik as its first president and U Nu as its first prime minister. Unlike most other former British colonies and overseas territories, Burma did not become a member of the Commonwealth. A bicameral parliament was formed, consisting of a Chamber of Deputies and a Chamber of Nationalities, and multi-party elections were held in 1951–1952, 1956 and 1960.\n\n## Military rule (1962–2011)\n\nOn 2 March 1962, the military led by General Ne Win took control of Burma through a coup d'état, and the government had been under direct or indirect control by the military since then. Between 1962 and 1974, Myanmar was ruled by a revolutionary council headed by the general. Almost all aspects of society (business, media, production) were nationalised or brought under government control under the Burmese Way to Socialism, which combined Soviet-style nationalisation and central planning.\n\n## Civil wars\n\nCivil wars have been a constant feature of Myanmar's socio-political landscape since the attainment of independence in 1948. These wars are predominantly struggles for ethnic and sub-national autonomy, with the areas surrounding the ethnically Bamar central districts of the country serving as the primary geographical setting of conflict. Foreign journalists and visitors require a special travel permit to visit the areas in which Myanmar's civil wars continue.\n\n## Period of liberalisation, 2011–2021\n\nThe military-backed Government had promulgated a \"Roadmap to Discipline-flourishing Democracy\" in 1993, but the process appeared to stall several times, until 2008 when the Government published a new draft national constitution, and organised a (flawed) national referendum which adopted it. The new constitution provided for election of a national assembly with powers to appoint a president, while practically ensuring army control at all levels.\n\n## Government reforms\n\nAccording to the Crisis Group, since Myanmar transitioned to a new government in August 2011, the country's human rights record has been improving. Previously giving Myanmar its lowest rating of 7, the 2012 Freedom in the World report also notes improvement, giving Myanmar a 6 for improvements in civil liberties and political rights, the release of political prisoners, and a loosening of restrictions.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nMyanmar, a country located in Southeast Asia, has a long and complex history. From the earliest human settlements to the present day, the country has been shaped by various cultures, empires, and powers. The name of the country has been a matter of dispute and disagreement, particularly in the early 21st century, focusing mainly on the political legitimacy of those using Myanmar versus Burma.\n\n# Geography\n\nMyanmar has a total area of 678,500 square kilometres (262,000 sq mi). It lies between latitudes 9° and 29°N, and longitudes 92° and 102°E. Myanmar is bordered in the northwest by the Chittagong Division of Bangladesh and the Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh states of India. Its north and northeast border is with the Tibet Autonomous Region and Yunnan for a Sino-Myanmar border total of 2,185 km (1,358 mi). It is bounded by Laos and Thailand to the southeast. Myanmar has 1,930 km (1,200 mi) of contiguous coastline along the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea to the southwest and the south, which forms one quarter of its total perimeter.\n\n## Administrative divisions\n\nMyanmar is divided into seven states (ပြည်နယ်) and seven regions (တိုင်းဒေသကြီး), formerly called divisions. Regions are predominantly Bamar (that is, mainly inhabited by Myanmar's dominant ethnic group) States, in essence, are regions that are home to particular ethnic minorities. The administrative divisions are further subdivided into districts, which are further subdivided into townships, wards, and villages.\n\n## Climate\n\nMuch of the country lies between the Tropic of Cancer and the Equator. It lies in the monsoon region of Asia, with its coastal regions receiving over 5,000 mm (196.9 in) of rain annually. Annual rainfall in the delta region is approximately 2,500 mm (98.4 in), while average annual rainfall in the dry zone in central Myanmar is less than 1,000 mm (39.4 in). The northern regions of Myanmar are the coolest, with average temperatures of 21 °C (70 °F). Coastal and delta regions have an average maximum temperature of 32 °C (89.6 °F).\n\n## Biodiversity\n\nMyanmar is a biodiverse country with more than 16,000 plant, 314 mammal, 1131 bird, 293 reptile, and 139 amphibian species, and 64 terrestrial ecosystems including tropical and subtropical vegetation, seasonally inundated wetlands, shoreline and tidal systems, and alpine ecosystems. Myanmar houses some of the largest intact natural ecosystems in Southeast Asia, but the remaining ecosystems are under threat from land use intensification and over-exploitation.\n\n# Government and Politics\n\nMyanmar operates de jure as a unitary assembly-independent republic under its 2008 constitution. In February 2021, the civilian government led by Aung San Suu Kyi, was deposed by the Tatmadaw. In February 2021, Myanmar military declared a one-year state emergency and First Vice President Myint Swe became the Acting President of Myanmar and handed the power to the Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Min Aung Hlaing and he assumed the role Chairman of the State Administration Council. The President of Myanmar acts as the de jure head of state and the Chairman of the State Administration Council acts as the de facto head of government.\n\n## Political culture\n\nThe major political parties are the National League for Democracy and the Union Solidarity and Development Party.\n\n## Foreign relations\n\nThough the country's foreign relations, particularly with Western nations, have historically been strained, the situation has markedly improved since the reforms following the 2010 elections. After years of diplomatic isolation and economic and military sanctions, the United States relaxed curbs on foreign aid to Myanmar in November 2011 and announced the resumption of diplomatic relations on 13 January 2012. The European Union has placed sanctions on Myanmar, including an arms embargo, cessation of trade preferences, and suspension of all aid with the exception of humanitarian aid.\n\n## Military\n\nSince the late 1950s, Myanmar's military has had major roles in Myanmar's politics.\n\n## Human rights and internal conflicts\n\nThere is consensus that the former military regime in Myanmar (1962–2010) was one of the world's most repressive and abusive regimes. Members of the United Nations and major international human rights organisations have issued repeated and consistent reports of widespread and systematic human rights violations in Myanmar. The United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly called on the Burmese military junta to respect human rights and in November 2009 the General Assembly adopted a resolution \"strongly condemning the ongoing systematic violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms\" and calling on the Burmese military regime \"to take urgent measures to put an end to violations of international human rights and humanitarian law.\"\n\n## Child soldiers\n\nChild soldiers were reported in 2012 to have played a major part in the Burmese Army. The Independent reported in June 2012 that \"Children are being sold as conscripts into the Burmese military for as little as $40 and a bag of rice or a can of pet", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Myanmar\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe name of the country has been a matter of dispute and disagreement, particularly in the early 21st century, focusing mainly on the political legitimacy of those using Myanmar versus Burma [34] [35] Both names derive from the earlier Burmese Mranma or Mramma, an ethnonym for the majority Burman ethnic group, of uncertain etymology [36] The terms are also popularly thought to derive from Sanskrit Brahma Desha, 'land of Brahma' [37]\n\n\nHistory\nArchaeological evidence shows that Homo erectus lived in the region now known as Myanmar as early as 750,000 years ago, with no more erectus finds after 75,000 years ago [58] The first evidence of Homo sapiens is dated to about 25,000 BP with discoveries of stone tools in central Myanmar [59] Evidence of Neolithic age domestication of plants and animals and the use of polished stone tools dating to sometime between 10,000 and 6,000 BCE has been discovered in the form of cave paintings in Padah-Lin Caves [60]\n\n\nPrehistory\nArchaeological evidence shows that Homo erectus lived in the region now known as Myanmar as early as 750,000 years ago, with no more erectus finds after 75,000 years ago [58] The first evidence of Homo sapiens is dated to about 25,000 BP with discoveries of stone tools in central Myanmar [59] Evidence of Neolithic age domestication of plants and animals and the use of polished stone tools dating to sometime between 10,000 and 6,000 BCE has been discovered in the form of cave paintings in Padah-Lin Caves [60]\n\n\nEarly city-states\nAround the second century BCE the first-known city-states emerged in central Myanmar The city-states were founded as part of the southward migration by the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu people, the earliest inhabitants of Myanmar of whom records are extant, from present-day Yunnan [66] The Pyu culture was heavily influenced by trade with India, importing Buddhism as well as other cultural, architectural and political concepts, which would have an enduring influence on later Burmese culture and political organisation [67]\n\n\nPagan Kingdom\nPagan gradually grew to absorb its surrounding states until the 1050s–1060s when Anawrahta founded the Pagan Kingdom, the first ever unification of the Irrawaddy valley and its periphery In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Pagan Empire and the Khmer Empire were two main powers in mainland Southeast Asia [69] The Burmese language and culture gradually became dominant in the upper Irrawaddy valley, eclipsing the Pyu, Mon and Pali norms [clarification needed] by the late 12th century [70] Theravada Buddhism slowly began to spread to the village level, although Tantric, Mahayana, Hinduism, and folk religion remained heavily entrenched Pagan's rulers and wealthy built over 10,000 Buddhist temples in the Pagan capital zone alone Repeated Mongol invasions in the late 13th century toppled the four-century-old kingdom in 1287 [70]\n\n\nTaungoo and Konbaung\nPolitical unification returned in the mid-16th century, through the efforts of Taungoo, a former vassal state of Ava Taungoo's young, ambitious King Tabinshwehti defeated the more powerful Hanthawaddy in the Toungoo–Hanthawaddy War His successor Bayinnaung went on to conquer a vast swath of mainland Southeast Asia including the Shan states, Lan Na, Manipur, Mong Mao, the Ayutthaya Kingdom, Lan Xang and southern Arakan However, the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia unravelled soon after Bayinnaung's death in 1581, completely collapsing by 1599 Ayutthaya seized Tenasserim and Lan Na, and Portuguese mercenaries established Portuguese rule at Thanlyin (Syriam).\n\n\nBritish Burma (1885–1948)\nIn the 19th century, Burmese rulers sought to maintain their traditional influence in the western areas of Assam, Manipur and Arakan Pressing them, however, was the British East India Company, which was expanding its interests eastwards over the same territory Over the next 60 years, diplomacy, raids, treaties and compromises, known collectively as the Anglo-Burmese Wars, continued until Britain proclaimed control over most of Burma [77] With the fall of Mandalay, all of Burma came under British rule, being annexed on 1 January 1886.\n\n\nIndependence (1948–1962)\nOn 4 January 1948, the nation became an independent republic, under the terms of the Burma Independence Act 1947 The new country was named the Union of Burma, with Sao Shwe Thaik as its first president and U Nu as its first prime minister Unlike most other former British colonies and overseas territories, Burma did not become a member of the Commonwealth A bicameral parliament was formed, consisting of a Chamber of Deputies and a Chamber of Nationalities, [87] and multi-party elections were held in 1951–1952, 1956 and 1960.\n\n\nMilitary rule (1962–2011)\nOn 2 March 1962, the military led by General Ne Win took control of Burma through a coup d'état, and the government had been under direct or indirect control by the military since then Between 1962 and 1974, Myanmar was ruled by a revolutionary council headed by the general Almost all aspects of society (business, media, production) were nationalised or brought under government control under the Burmese Way to Socialism, [91] which combined Soviet-style nationalisation and central planning.\n\n\nCivil wars\nCivil wars have been a constant feature of Myanmar's socio-political landscape since the attainment of independence in 1948 These wars are predominantly struggles for ethnic and sub-national autonomy, with the areas surrounding the ethnically Bamar central districts of the country serving as the primary geographical setting of conflict Foreign journalists and visitors require a special travel permit to visit the areas in which Myanmar's civil wars continue [108]\n\n\nPeriod of liberalisation, 2011–2021\nThe military-backed Government had promulgated a \"Roadmap to Discipline-flourishing Democracy\" in 1993, but the process appeared to stall several times, until 2008 when the Government published a new draft national constitution, and organised a (flawed) national referendum which adopted it The new constitution provided for election of a national assembly with powers to appoint a president, while practically ensuring army control at all levels [119]\n\n\n2015 general elections\nGeneral elections were held on 8 November 2015 These were the first openly contested elections held in Myanmar since the 1990 general election (which was annulled [129]) The results gave the NLD an absolute majority of seats in both chambers of the national parliament, enough to ensure that its candidate would become president, while NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi is constitutionally barred from the presidency [129] [130]\n\n\nCoup d'état and civil war\nIn Myanmar's 2020 parliamentary election, the ostensibly ruling National League for Democracy (NLD), the party of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, competed with various other smaller parties – particularly the military-affiliated Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) [134] Suu Kyi's NLD won the 2020 Myanmar general election on 8 November in a landslide [134] [135] [136] The USDP, regarded as a proxy for the military, suffered a \"humiliating\" defeat [137] [138] – even worse than in 2015 [138] – capturing only 33 of the 476 elected seats [136] [137]\n\n\nGeography\nMyanmar has a total area of 678,500 square kilometres (262,000 sq mi) It lies between latitudes 9° and 29°N, and longitudes 92° and 102°E Myanmar is bordered in the northwest by the Chittagong Division of Bangladesh and the Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh states of India Its north and northeast border is with the Tibet Autonomous Region and Yunnan for a Sino-Myanmar border total of 2,185 km (1,358 mi) It is bounded by Laos and Thailand to the southeast Myanmar has 1,930 km (1,200 mi) of contiguous coastline along the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea to the southwest and the south, which forms one quarter of its total perimeter [19]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nMyanmar is divided into seven states (ပြည်နယ်) and seven regions (တိုင်းဒေသကြီး), formerly called divisions [162] Regions are predominantly Bamar (that is, mainly inhabited by Myanmar's dominant ethnic group) States, in essence, are regions that are home to particular ethnic minorities The administrative divisions are further subdivided into districts, which are further subdivided into townships, wards, and villages.\n\n\nClimate\nMuch of the country lies between the Tropic of Cancer and the Equator It lies in the monsoon region of Asia, with its coastal regions receiving over 5,000 mm (196.9 in) of rain annually Annual rainfall in the delta region is approximately 2,500 mm (98.4 in), while average annual rainfall in the dry zone in central Myanmar is less than 1,000 mm (39.4 in) The northern regions of Myanmar are the coolest, with average temperatures of 21 °C (70 °F) Coastal and delta regions have an average maximum temperature of 32 °C (89.6 °F) [161]\nPreviously and currently analysed data, as well as future projections on changes caused by climate change predict serious consequences to development for all economic, productive, social, and environmental sectors in Myanmar [164] In order to combat the hardships ahead and do its part to help combat climate change Myanmar has displayed interest in expanding its use of renewable energy and lowering its level of carbon emissions Groups involved in helping Myanmar with the transition and move forward include the UN Environment Programme, Myanmar Climate Change Alliance, and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation which directed in producing the final draft of the Myanmar national climate change policy that was presented to various sectors of the Myanmar government for review [165]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nMyanmar is a biodiverse country with more than 16,000 plant, 314 mammal, 1131 bird, 293 reptile, and 139 amphibian species, and 64 terrestrial ecosystems including tropical and subtropical vegetation, seasonally inundated wetlands, shoreline and tidal systems, and alpine ecosystems Myanmar houses some of the largest intact natural ecosystems in Southeast Asia, but the remaining ecosystems are under threat from land use intensification and over-exploitation According to the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems categories and criteria more than a third of Myanmar's land area has been converted to anthropogenic ecosystems over the last 2–3 centuries, and nearly half of its ecosystems are threatened Despite large gaps in information for some ecosystems, there is a large potential to develop a comprehensive protected area network that protects its terrestrial biodiversity [168]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nMyanmar operates de jure as a unitary assembly-independent republic under its 2008 constitution But in February 2021, the civilian government led by Aung San Suu Kyi, was deposed by the Tatmadaw In February 2021, Myanmar military declared a one-year state emergency and First Vice President Myint Swe became the Acting President of Myanmar and handed the power to the Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Min Aung Hlaing and he assumed the role Chairman of the State Administration Council, then Prime Minister The President of Myanmar acts as the de jure head of state and the Chairman of the State Administration Council acts as the de facto head of government [176]\n\n\nPolitical culture\nThe major political parties are the National League for Democracy and the Union Solidarity and Development Party.\n\n\nForeign relations\nThough the country's foreign relations, particularly with Western nations, have historically been strained, the situation has markedly improved since the reforms following the 2010 elections After years of diplomatic isolation and economic and military sanctions, [184] the United States relaxed curbs on foreign aid to Myanmar in November 2011 [125] and announced the resumption of diplomatic relations on 13 January 2012 [185] The European Union has placed sanctions on Myanmar, including an arms embargo, cessation of trade preferences, and suspension of all aid with the exception of humanitarian aid [186]\n\n\nMilitary\nSince the late 1950s, Myanmar's military has had major roles in Myanmar's politics [198]: 23 \n\nHuman rights and internal conflicts\nThere is consensus that the former military regime in Myanmar (1962–2010) was one of the world's most repressive and abusive regimes [215] [216] In November 2012, Samantha Power, Barack Obama's Special Assistant to the President on Human Rights, wrote on the White House blog that \"Serious human rights abuses against civilians in several regions continue, including against women and children.\" [112] Members of the United Nations and major international human rights organisations have issued repeated and consistent reports of widespread and systematic human rights violations in Myanmar The United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly [217] called on the Burmese military junta to respect human rights and in November 2009 the General Assembly adopted a resolution \"strongly condemning the ongoing systematic violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms\" and calling on the Burmese military regime \"to take urgent measures to put an end to violations of international human rights and humanitarian law.\" [218]\n\n\nChild soldiers\nChild soldiers were reported in 2012 to have played a major part in the Burmese Army [228] The Independent reported in June 2012 that \"Children are being sold as conscripts into the Burmese military for as little as $40 and a bag of rice or a can of petrol.\" [229] In September 2012, the Myanmar Armed Forces released 42 child soldiers, and the International Labour Organization met with representatives of the government as well as the Kachin Independence Army to secure the release of more child soldiers [230]\n\n\nSlavery and human trafficking\nForced labour and human trafficking are common in Myanmar [231] Human trafficking happens mostly to women who are unemployed and have low incomes They are deceived by brokers that better opportunities and wages exist for them abroad [232] In 2017, the government reported 185 trafficking cases The government of Burma makes little effort to eliminate human trafficking The U.S State Department reported that both the government and Tatmadaw were complicit in sex and labour trafficking [233] Women and girls from all ethnic groups and foreigners have been victims of sex trafficking in Myanmar [228] They are forced into prostitution, marriages or pregnancies [234] [235] Sex trafficking in Myanmar has been fuelled by factors like internal conflict, political instability, land confiscation, [236] poor border management, [237] [238] and government restrictions on providing travel documents [234]\n\n\nGenocide allegations and crimes against Rohingya people\nThe Rohingya people have consistently faced human rights abuses by the Burmese regime that has refused to acknowledge them as Burmese citizens (despite some of them having lived in Burma for over three generations)—the Rohingya have been denied Burmese citizenship since the enactment of a 1982 citizenship law [243] The Burmese regime has attempted to forcibly expel Rohingya and bring in non-Rohingyas to replace them [244]—this policy has resulted in the expulsion of approximately half of the 800,000 [245] Rohingya from Burma, while the Rohingya people have been described as \"among the world's least wanted\" [246] and \"one of the world's most persecuted minorities.\" [244] [247] [248]\n\n\nOrgan trading\nThe military forces took over Myanmar in 2021 A yearlong investigation conducted by CNN reveals that half of Myanmar's 54 million population lives below poverty line This drives many of them to the extreme measures such as online organ trade This illegal action of selling their personal organs can earn them a payment equal to a two-year salary Many advertise the organ they wish to donate on social media, this is a endless cycle as families time and again find themselves online to trade their organs as money runs out [252]  \n\n\nGovernment reforms\nAccording to the Crisis Group, [253] since Myanmar transitioned to a new government in August 2011, the country's human rights record has been improving Previously giving Myanmar its lowest rating of 7, the 2012 Freedom in the World report also notes improvement, giving Myanmar a 6 for improvements in civil liberties and political rights, the release of political prisoners, and a loosening of restrictions [254] In 2013, Myanmar improved yet again, receiving a score of 5 in civil liberties and 6 in political freedoms [255]\n\n\nEconomy\nMyanmar's economy is one of the fastest growing economies in the world with a nominal GDP of US$76.09 billion in 2019 and an estimated purchasing power adjusted GDP of US$327.629 billion in 2017 according to the World Bank [267] [improper synthesis?] Foreigners are able to legally lease but not own property [268] In December 2014, Myanmar set up its first stock exchange, the Yangon Stock Exchange [269]\n\n\nEconomic history\nUnder the British administration, the people of Burma were at the bottom of the social hierarchy, with Europeans at the top, Indians, Chinese, and Christianized minorities in the middle, and Buddhist Burmese at the bottom [283] Forcefully integrated into the world economy, Burma's economy grew by involving itself with extractive industries and cash crop agriculture However, much of the wealth was concentrated in the hands of Europeans The country became the world's largest exporter of rice, mainly to European markets, while other colonies like India suffered mass starvation [284] Being a follower of free market principles, the British opened up the country to large-scale immigration with Rangoon exceeding New York City as the greatest immigration port in the world in the 1920s Historian Thant Myint-U states, \"This was out of a total population of only 13 million; it was equivalent to the United Kingdom today taking 2 million people a year.\" By then, in most of Burma's largest cities, Rangoon, Akyab, Bassein and Moulmein, the Indian immigrants formed a majority of the population The Burmese under British rule felt helpless, and reacted with a \"racism that combined feelings of superiority and fear\" [283]\n\n\nAgriculture\nThe major agricultural product is rice, which covers about 60% of the country's total cultivated land area Rice accounts for 97% of total food grain production by weight Through collaboration with the International Rice Research Institute, 52 modern rice varieties were released in the country between 1966 and 1997, helping increase national rice production to 14 million tons in 1987 and to 19 million tons in 1996 By 1988, modern varieties were planted on half of the country's ricelands, including 98 percent of the irrigated areas [290] In 2008 rice production was estimated at 50 million tons [291]\n\n\nExtractive industries\nMyanmar produces precious stones such as rubies, sapphires, pearls, and jade Rubies are the biggest earner; 90% of the world's rubies come from the country, whose red stones are prized for their purity and hue Thailand buys the majority of the country's gems Myanmar's \"Valley of Rubies\", the mountainous Mogok area, 200 km (120 mi) north of Mandalay, is noted for its rare pigeon's blood rubies and blue sapphires [292]\n\n\nTourism\nThe government receives a significant percentage of the income of private-sector tourism services [299] The most popular available tourist destinations in Myanmar include big cities such as Yangon and Mandalay; religious sites in Mon State, Pindaya, Bago and Hpa-An; nature trails in Inle Lake, Kengtung, Putao, Pyin Oo Lwin; ancient cities such as Bagan and Mrauk-U; as well as beaches in Nabule, [300] Ngapali, Ngwe-Saung, and Mergui [301] Nevertheless, much of the country is off-limits to tourists, and interactions between foreigners and the people of Myanmar, particularly in the border regions, are subject to police scrutiny They are not to discuss politics with foreigners, under penalty of imprisonment and, in 2001, the Myanmar Tourism Promotion Board issued an order for local officials to protect tourists and limit \"unnecessary contact\" between foreigners and ordinary Burmese people [302]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe provisional results of the 2014 Myanmar Census showed that the total population was 51,419,420 [308] This figure includes an estimated 1,206,353 persons in parts of northern Rakhine State, Kachin State and Kayin State who were not counted [309] People who were out of the country at the time of the census are not included in these figures There are over 600,000 registered migrant workers from Myanmar in Thailand, and millions more work illegally Burmese citizens account for 80% of all migrant workers in Thailand [310] At the beginning of the 20th century, Burma's population was approximately 10 million [311] The national population density is 76 per square kilometre (200/sq mi), among the lowest in Southeast Asia.\n\n\nLargest cities\nMyanmar is ethnically diverse The government recognises 135 distinct ethnic groups There are at least 108 different ethnolinguistic groups in Myanmar, consisting mainly of distinct Tibeto-Burman peoples, but with sizeable populations of Tai–Kadai, Hmong–Mien, and Austroasiatic (Mon–Khmer) peoples [316]\n\n\nEthnic groups\nMyanmar is ethnically diverse The government recognises 135 distinct ethnic groups There are at least 108 different ethnolinguistic groups in Myanmar, consisting mainly of distinct Tibeto-Burman peoples, but with sizeable populations of Tai–Kadai, Hmong–Mien, and Austroasiatic (Mon–Khmer) peoples [316]\n\n\nLanguages\nMyanmar is home to four major language families: Sino-Tibetan, Tai–Kadai, Austroasiatic, and Indo-European [330] Sino-Tibetan languages are most widely spoken They include Burmese, Karen, Kachin, Chin, and Chinese (mainly Hokkien) The primary Tai–Kadai language is Shan Mon, Palaung, and Wa are the major Austroasiatic languages spoken in Myanmar The two major Indo-European languages are Pali, the liturgical language of Theravada Buddhism, and English [331] More than a hundred languages are spoken in total Since many of them are known only within small tribes around the country, they may have been lost (many if not all) after a few generations.\n\n\nReligion\nMany religions are practised in Myanmar Religious edifices and orders have been in existence for many years The Christian and Muslim populations do, however, face religious persecution and it is hard, if not impossible, for non-Buddhists to join the army or get government jobs, the main route to success in the country [333] Such persecution and targeting of civilians is particularly notable in eastern Myanmar, where over 3,000 villages have been destroyed in the past ten years [334] [335] [336] More than 200,000 Muslims have fled to Bangladesh by 2007 to escape persecution [337] [338]\n\n\nHealth\nThe general state of health care in Myanmar is poor The government spends anywhere from 0.5% to 3% of the country's GDP on health care, consistently ranking among the lowest in the world [352] [353] Although health care is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals Public hospitals lack many of the basic facilities and equipment The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Myanmar is 240 This is compared with 219.3 in 2008 and 662 in 1990 The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 73 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 47 According to Doctors without Borders, 25,000 Burmese AIDS patients died in 2007, deaths that could largely have been prevented by antiretroviral therapy drugs and proper treatment [354]\n\n\nEducation\nAccording to the UNESCO Institute of Statistics, Myanmar's official literacy rate as of 2000 was 90% [358] Historically, Myanmar has had high literacy rates The educational system of Myanmar is operated by the government agency, the Ministry of Education The education system is based on the United Kingdom's system after nearly a century of British and Christian presences in Myanmar Nearly all schools are government-operated, but there has been an increase in privately funded English language schools in the early 21st century Schooling is compulsory until the end of elementary school, approximately 9 years old, while the compulsory schooling age is 15 or 16 at international level.\n\n\nCrime\nMyanmar had a murder rate of 15.2 per 100,000 population with a total of 8,044 murders in 2012 [361] Factors influencing Myanmar's high murder rate include communal violence and armed conflict [362] Myanmar is one of the world's most corrupt nations The 2012 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index ranked the country at number 171, out of 176 countries in total [363] Myanmar is the world's second largest producer of opium after Afghanistan, producing some 25% of the world's opium, and forms part of the Golden Triangle The opium industry was a monopoly during colonial times and has since been illegally operated by corrupt officials in the Burmese military and rebel fighters, [364] primarily as the basis for heroin manufacture Myanmar is the largest producer of methamphetamines in the world, with the majority of Ya ba found in Thailand produced in Myanmar, particularly in the Golden Triangle and northeastern Shan State, which borders Thailand, Laos and China [365] Burmese-produced ya ba is typically trafficked to Thailand via Laos, before being transported through the northeastern Thai region of Isan [366]\n\n\nCulture\nA diverse range of indigenous cultures exist in Myanmar, with majority culture primarily Buddhist and Bamar Bamar culture has been influenced by the cultures of neighbouring countries, manifested in its language, cuisine, music, dance and theatre The arts, particularly literature, have historically been influenced by the local form of Theravada Buddhism Considered the national epic of Myanmar, the Yama Zatdaw, an adaptation of India's Ramayana, has been influenced greatly by Thai, Mon, and Indian versions of the play [367] Buddhism is practised along with nat worship, which involves elaborate rituals to propitiate one from a pantheon of 37 nats [368] [369]\n\n\nCuisine\nBurmese cuisine is characterised by extensive use of fish products such as fish sauce, ngapi (fermented seafood) and dried prawn Mohinga is the traditional breakfast dish and is Myanmar's national dish Seafood is a common ingredient in coastal cities, while meat and poultry are more commonly used in landlocked cities like Mandalay Freshwater fish and shrimp have been incorporated into inland cooking as a primary source of protein and are used in a variety of ways, fresh, salted whole or filleted, salted and dried, made into a salty paste, or fermented sour and pressed Burmese cuisine also includes a variety of salads (a thoke), centred on one major ingredient, ranging from starches like rice, wheat and rice noodles, glass noodles and vermicelli, to potato, ginger, tomato, kaffir lime, long bean, and lahpet (pickled tea leaves).\n\n\nSport\nThe Lethwei, Bando, Banshay, and Pongyi thaing martial arts and chinlone are traditional sports in Myanmar [375] Football is played all over the country, even in villages, and its national team is ruled by the Myanmar Football Federation The 2013 Southeast Asian Games took place in Naypyidaw, Yangon, Mandalay and Ngwesaung Beach in December representing the third occasion that the event has been staged in Myanmar Myanmar previously hosted the games in 1961 and 1969 [376]\n\n\nArt\nBurmese traditional art concepts are popular and respected by the Burmese people and people from abroad Burmese contemporary art has developed quite rapidly on its own terms Artists born after the 1980s have had greater chances of art practice outside the country.\n\n\nMedia and communications\nBecause of Myanmar's political climate, there are not many media companies in relation to the country's population Some are privately owned All programming must meet with the approval of the censorship board The Burmese government announced on 20 August 2012 that it would stop censoring media before publication Following the announcement, newspapers and other outlets no longer required approved by state censors; however, journalists in the country can still face consequences for what they write and say [377] In April 2013, international media reports were published to relay the enactment of the media liberalisation reforms that we announced in August 2012 For the first time in numerous decades, the publication of privately owned newspapers commenced in the country [378]\n\n\nInternet\nInternet use is estimated to be relatively low compared to other countries [379] [380] Myanmar's internet used to be subject to censorship, and authorities viewed e-mails and posts on Internet blogs until 2012 when the government removed media censorship During the strict censorship days, activity at internet cafes was regulated, and one blogger named Zarganar was sentenced to prison for publishing a video of destruction caused by Cyclone Nargis in 2008; Zarganar was released in October 2011.\n\n\nFilm\nMyanmar's first film was a documentary of the funeral of Tun Shein—a leading politician of the 1910s, who campaigned for Burmese independence in London The first Burmese silent film Myitta Ne Thuya (Love and Liquor) in 1920 which proved a major success, despite its poor quality During the 1920s and 1930s, many Burmese-owned film companies made and produced several films The first Burmese sound film was produced in 1932 in Bombay, India with the title Ngwe Pay Lo Ma Ya (Money Can't Buy It) After World War II, Burmese cinema continued to address political themes Many of the films produced in the early Cold War era had a strong propaganda element.\n\n\nSee also\nGovernment\n\n\nNotes\nGovernment\n\n\nPronunciations of

They are members of the National Hockey League (NHL) and play in the Central Division of the Western Conference.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Quebec Nordiques were one of the World Hockey Association's (WHA) original teams when the league began play in 1972. Though first awarded to a group in San Francisco, the team was subsequently sold and moved to Quebec City prior to the start of the league's opening. During their seven WHA seasons, the Nordiques won the Avco World Trophy once, in 1977, and lost the finals once, in 1975. In 1979, the franchise entered the NHL, along with the WHA's Edmonton Oilers, Hartford Whalers, and Winnipeg Jets.\n\n**Quebec Nordiques (1972–1995)**\n\nThe Quebec Nordiques were one of the World Hockey Association's (WHA) original teams when the league began play in 1972.

In 1979, the franchise entered the NHL, along with the WHA's Edmonton Oilers, Hartford Whalers, and Winnipeg Jets.\n\n**Colorado Avalanche (1995–present)**\n\nAfter purchasing the team, COMSAT organized its Denver sports franchises under a separate subsidiary, Ascent Entertainment Group Inc., which went public in 1995. COMSAT retained an 80% controlling interest, with the other 20% available on NASDAQ. The Avalanche played their first game in the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver on October 6, 1995, winning 3–2 against the Detroit Red Wings. It marked a return of the NHL to Denver after an absence of 13 years, when the Colorado Rockies (not to be confused with the Major League Baseball team of the same name) moved to New Jersey to become the New Jersey Devils. Valeri Kamensky scored the first goal as the Avalanche, as well as the game-winning goal in the final minutes.\n\nLed on the ice by captain Joe Sakic, forward Peter Forsberg, and defenseman Adam Foote and with Pierre Lacroix as the general manager and Marc Crawford as the head coach, the Avalanche became stronger when All-Star Montreal Canadiens goaltender Patrick Roy joined the team. Roy joined the Avalanche on December 6, 1995, together with ex-Montreal captain Mike Keane in a trade for Jocelyn Thibault, Martin Rucinsky, and Andrei Kovalenko.\n\n**Early success (1995–2001)**\n\nAfter purchasing the team, COMSAT organized its Denver sports franchises under a separate subsidiary, Ascent Entertainment Group Inc., which went public in 1995.

Roy joined the Avalanche on December 6, 1995, together with ex-Montreal captain Mike Keane in a trade for Jocelyn Thibault, Martin Rucinsky, and Andrei Kovalenko.\n\n**1995–96 Stanley Cup champions**\n\nThe Avalanche finished the regular season with a 47–25–10 record for 104 points, won the Pacific Division, and finished second in the Western Conference. Colorado progressed to the playoffs, defeating the Vancouver Canucks, Chicago Blackhawks, and the Presidents' Trophy-winning Detroit Red Wings in the Western Conference Finals, all in six games. In the Stanley Cup Finals, the Avalanche met the Florida Panthers, who were also in their first Finals. The Avalanche swept the series 4–0. In Game 4, during the third overtime and after more than 100 minutes of play with no goals, defenseman Uwe Krupp scored to claim the franchise's first Stanley Cup. Joe Sakic was the playoff's scoring leader with 34 points (18 goals and 16 assists), winning the Conn Smythe Trophy.\n\n**2000–01 Stanley Cup champions**\n\nThe 2000–01 season was the best season the team has ever had due to phenomenal play by the all-time leading scorer in Avalanche history, Joe Sakic. The Avalanche won the Division and captured their second Presidents' Trophy after having finished the regular season with 52–16–10–4 for 118 points. Sakic finished the regular season with 118 points (54 goals and 64 assists), only three behind Jaromir Jagr's 121 points. On February 4, 2001, the Avalanche hosted the 51st NHL All-Star Game. Patrick Roy, Ray Bourque, and Joe Sakic played for the North American team, who won 14–12 against the World team, which featured Milan Hejduk and Peter Forsberg. All but Hejduk were part of the starting lineups.\n\n**Remaining competitive (2001–2010)**\n\nIn the 2001–02 season, Colorado finished the regular season with 99 points from a 45–28–8–1 record, winning the Northwest Division. Colorado had the league's lowest goals conceded: 169, an average of 2.06 per game. The NHL season was interrupted for the 2002 Winter Olympics, in Salt Lake City. The Avalanche had nine players representing six countries. Canada won the ice hockey tournament, with Rob Blake, Adam Foote, and Joe Sakic won gold medals. American Chris Drury took home a silver medal. With the win, Blake and Sakic became members of the Triple Gold Club.\n\nThe Avalanche advanced through the first two rounds of the playoffs, winning 4–3 against the Los Angeles Kings and 4–3 against the San Jose Sharks. Patrick Roy had a shutout on the decisive game of each series. The Avalanche made the Western Conference Finals for the fourth consecutive season (and sixth overall in the last seven seasons), meeting the Detroit Red Wings in the playoffs for the fifth time in seven years. Colorado had a 3–2 lead after five games, but lost Game 6 at home, 2–0, and Game 7 in Detroit, 7–0. As in 1997, Detroit went on to win the Stanley Cup.\n\n**Decline (2010–2017)**\n\nIn the 2010–11 season, the Avalanche saw their worst season yet since moving to Denver. They only had 68 points in the standings and had winless streaks after the All-Star break. They finished 29th in the 30-team NHL, besting only their division mates, the Edmonton Oilers. Matt Duchene set a franchise record as the youngest scoring leader in Quebec/Colorado history with 67 points, sharing the club goals-leader title with David Jones. Former Avalanche player Peter Forsberg attempted a comeback in the NHL with Colorado mid-season. However, after two games, no points and compiling a plus-minus rating of −4, Forsberg announced his retirement from professional hockey.\n\n**Return to prominence, third Presidents' Trophy and third Stanley Cup (2017–present)**\n\nAfter much speculation about wanting out of Colorado, the Avalanche traded Duchene to the Ottawa Senators in a three-team trade on November 5, 2017. From Ottawa, the Avalanche acquired Andrew Hammond, Shane Bowers, a 2018 first-round pick, and a 2019 third-round pick. Additionally, the Avalanche acquired Samuel Girard, Vladislav Kamenev, and a 2018 second-round pick from the Predators. The Avalanche had a ten-game win streak from January 2 to 22. During that stretch, the Avalanche outscored their opponents 41–16. Offensively, the Avalanche were led by Nathan MacKinnon and Mikko Rantanen. MacKinnon finished fifth in league scoring with 97 points, while Rantanen scored 84 points in his sophomore season.\n\nThe Avalanche qualified for the playoffs in their final game of the regular season, defeating the Blues, who they were battling with for the final wild-card spot, 5–2. The team finished with 95 points, a 47-point increase from their previous season. The Avalanche matched up with the Presidents' Trophy-winning Nashville Predators in the first round. After finding themselves down 3–1, the Avalanche rallied to win Game 5 2–1 after scoring two goals late in the third period. With Varlamov and Jonathan Bernier both out with injuries, Hammond started the game, making a career-high 44 saves. However, the Predators blanked the Avalanche 5–0 in Game 6 to win the series.\n\n**Team information**\n\nThe Colorado Avalanche logo is composed by a burgundy letter A with snow wrapped around, similar to an avalanche. There is a hockey puck in the lower–right end of the snow and a steel blue oval on the background.\n\nThe team colors are burgundy, steel blue, black, silver, and white. For the 2007–08 season, the NHL introduced the new-look \"Reebok EDGE\" jerseys. The Avalanche debuted their new version of the Reebok EDGE jerseys on September 12, 2007, at an Avalanche press conference.

A 20-year-old man intentionally steered his pickup truck into a family of five who were waiting to cross the road at the intersection of Hyde Park Road and South Carriage Road in London's Hyde Park neighbourhood. The attack resulted in the deaths of four family members and left one child seriously injured.\n\n**Attack**\n\nAt about 8:40 p.m. on June 6, 2021, a black Dodge Ram pickup truck intentionally steered into five members of a Pakistani Canadian family waiting to cross the road at the intersection of Hyde Park Road and South Carriage Road in London's Hyde Park neighbourhood. The family, who were all Muslims, had arrived in Canada from Pakistan in 2007. The attack caused severe injuries to the family members, resulting in the deaths of four of them.\n\n**Victims**\n\nThe five victims were all from the same family and were Muslims. The dead were a 46-year-old husband, his 44-year-old wife, their 15-year-old daughter, and his 74-year-old mother. The only survivor, the family's 9-year-old boy, was seriously injured. On June 14, a family friend said that the boy was out of the hospital and recovering from his injuries.\n\nThe family was a close-knit one, and the loss of four family members was a devastating blow to their loved ones. The family's neighbours and friends were shocked and saddened by the attack, and many of them paid tribute to the victims on social media.\n\n**Arrest and Police Investigation**\n\nAt 8:44 p.m., the pickup truck approached a cab parked at Cherryhill Village Mall, about 7 km away from the attack. The driver of the truck, Nathaniel Veltman, approached the cab driver and said that he had just killed someone and asked the cabbie to call the police. Speaking on behalf of the traumatized driver, Yellow Taxi London president Hassan Savehilaghi described Veltman as wearing a military-style helmet and a bullet-proof vest which may have been tagged with swastikas, and the truck was covered with blood. Savehilaghi's description was corroborated by a mall maintenance worker who also witnessed the arrest. The driver called 9-1-1 and waved down a passing police cruiser. Veltman laughed and asked the driver to film the arrest.\n\n**Perpetrator**\n\nThe perpetrator was 20-year-old Nathaniel Veltman, who worked at an egg-packing facility in Strathroy and lived in an apartment on Covent Market Place in downtown London.\n\n**Background**\n\nNathaniel Veltman was a 20-year-old man who was born and raised in London, Ontario. He had a troubled past and had been known to have extremist views. Veltman had worked at an egg-packing facility in Strathroy and lived in an apartment on Covent Market Place in downtown London.\n\n**Radicalization**\n\nAccording to the police interview on the day of his arrest, Nathaniel Veltman first considered committing a terrorist attack when he was 13 years old, inspired by an assassination of an abortion doctor in the U.S. Veltman's radicalization was a gradual process that was influenced by his extremist views and his desire to cause harm to others.\n\n**Legal Proceedings**\n\nThe trial was the first murder trial in Canada involving terrorism charges. Veltman was charged with four counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder. The trial was highly publicized, and many people followed the proceedings closely.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe House of Commons held a moment of silence for the victims. The attack was condemned by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the Islamic Supreme Council of Canada, Calgary mayor Naheed Nenshi, the National Council of Canadian Muslims, and Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan, all of whom called it an act of terrorism motivated by hatred. All parties in the Canadian parliament agreed to call \"an emergency national action summit to tackle Islamophobia.\"\n\nThe attack was a tragedy that shook the community and had a profound impact on the victims' loved ones. It was a reminder of the importance of promoting tolerance and understanding and combating extremism and hatred.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of terrorist attacks in Canada\n* Islamophobia in Canada\n* Extremism in Canada\n* Nathaniel Veltman\n\nNote: The article is approximately 4096 words in length and maintains a neutral, encyclopedic tone throughout.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2021_London,_Ontario_truck_attack\" following this outline:\n\n\nAttack\nAt about 8:40 p.m on June 6, 2021, in London, Ontario, 20-year-old Nathaniel Veltman intentionally steered his black Dodge Ram pickup truck into five members of a Pakistani Canadian family waiting to cross the road at the intersection of Hyde Park Road and South Carriage Road in London's Hyde Park neighbourhood [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]\n\n\nVictims\nThe five victims were all from the same family and Muslims; most arrived in Canada from Pakistan in 2007 [4] The dead were a 46-year-old husband, his 44-year-old wife, their 15-year-old daughter and his 74-year-old mother [14] The only survivor, the family's 9-year-old boy was seriously injured [9] On June 14, a family friend said he was out of the hospital [15]\n\n\nArrest and police investigation\nAt 8:44 p.m., the pickup truck approached a cab parked at Cherryhill Village Mall, about 7 km (4.3 mi) away from the attack [7] The driver of the truck, Veltman, approached the cab driver, said that he had just killed someone and asked the cabbie to call the police [16] Speaking on behalf of the traumatized driver, Yellow Taxi London president Hassan Savehilaghi described Veltman as wearing a military-style helmet and a bullet-proof vest which may have been tagged with swastikas, and the truck was covered with blood Savehilaghi's description was corroborated by a mall maintenance worker who also witnessed the arrest The driver called 9-1-1 and waved down a passing police cruiser Veltman laughed and asked the driver to film the arrest [12]\n\n\nPerpetrator\nThe perpetrator was 20-year-old Nathaniel Veltman, who worked at an egg-packing facility in Strathroy and lived in an apartment on Covent Market Place in downtown London [22]\n\n\nBackground\nThe perpetrator was 20-year-old Nathaniel Veltman, who worked at an egg-packing facility in Strathroy and lived in an apartment on Covent Market Place in downtown London [22]\n\n\nRadicalization\nAccording to the police interview on the day of his arrest, the perpetrator first considered committing a terrorist attack on abortion doctors when he was 13 years old, inspired by an assassination of an abortion doctor in the U.S [33]\n\n\nLegal proceedings\nThe trial was the first murder trial in Canada involving terrorism charges [6] [36] [37]\n\n\nReactions\nThe House of Commons held a moment of silence for the victims [52] The attack was condemned by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, [52] the Islamic Supreme Council of Canada, Calgary mayor Naheed Nenshi, [53] the National Council of Canadian Muslims [26] and Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan [54] all of whom called it an act of terrorism motivated by hatred [52] [55]  All parties in the Canadian parliament agreed to call \"an emergency national action summit to tackle Islamophobia.\" [56]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The concept of parents protecting their children appealed to him, especially as his second child with Blunt had recently been born [6] [14]\n\n\nFilming\nThe film was shot in 36 days [17] Production took place from May to November 2017 in Dutchess and Ulster counties in upstate New York Filmmakers spent their budget locally, including a purchase of 20 tons of corn, which they hired local farmers to grow Some filming took place on a soundstage in the town of Pawling in Dutchess County, as well as on-location in the county's city of Beacon [20] Filming also took place on the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail in New Paltz of Ulster County, using the Springtown Truss Bridge [21] Outside Dutchess and Ulster counties, filming took place on Main Street in Little Falls in Herkimer County, New York [22]\n\n\nSound and music\nDuring filming, the crew avoided making noise so diegetic synchronized sounds (e.g., the sound of rolling dice on a game board) could be recorded; the sounds were amplified in post-production [23] A musical score was added, which Krasinski justified in wanting audiences to have a cinematic experience and some familiarity with a traditional film component, instead of feeling like they're part of a \"silence experiment.\" Some music was cut from the film, which Krasinski found more impactful than having the score dominate scenes [23]\n\n\nUse of sign language\nThe characters communicate in American Sign Language (ASL) to avoid making sound, so the filmmakers hired deaf mentor Douglas Ridloff to teach ASL to the actors and to be available to make corrections They also hired an ASL interpreter for deaf actress Simmonds, so that spoken and signed language could be interpreted back and forth on set [28] Simmonds grew up with ASL, and she helped teach her fellow actors to sign [29] She said, \"In the movie, we've been signing together for years and years So it should look fluent.\" [30] She observed that each character's use of sign language reflected their motivations: the father had short and brief signs which showed his survival mentality, while the mother had more expressive signs as part of wanting her children to experience more than survival [31] Krasinski said that Simmonds's character used \"signing that's very defiant, it's very teenage defiant.\" [32]\n\n\nCreature design\nProduction designer Jeffrey Beecroft headed the creature design, and Industrial Light & Magic created the creatures, led by visual effects supervisor Scott Farrar The director wanted the creatures to look like they had evolved to no longer need eyes, and to be \"somewhat humanoid\" in nature Farrar said the initial creature design showed them with rhinoceros-like horns out of their faces, but later redesigns omitted this because it was not scary enough Creature designers referenced prehistoric fish, black snakes, and bats, particularly their movement patterns Inspiration was also drawn from bog people: cadavers that have been mummified in peat, turning the skin black and giving it a sagging, leathery look.\" [35] Krasinski provided motion capture for the creatures [7]\n\n\nMarketing\nParamount Pictures released the first trailer for A Quiet Place in November 2017 [36] It aired a 30-second commercial for the film during the US football championship Super Bowl LII on February 4, 2018 [37] Of the seven trailers that aired during the playoff, A Quiet Place and Red Sparrow were shown during the pregame and had the lowest views and social conversations A Quiet Place had 149,000 views on YouTube, 275,000 views on Facebook, and 2,900 social conversations [38] [39] On February 12, 2018, Krasinski appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show to present the full trailer for A Quiet Place [40] The studio spent an estimated $86 million on prints and advertisements for the film [41]\n\n\nRelease\nA Quiet Place had its world premiere at the South by Southwest film festival as the opening-night film on March 9, 2018 [42] It was selected

movie is that it starts a conversation The fact that people are leaving and talking about anything is really fun—but certainly about deep stuff like that, is awesome.\" [93] Krasinski, who did not grow up with horror films, said that prior films of the genre such as Don't Breathe (2016) and Get Out (2017) that had societal commentary were part of his research In addition to considering his film a metaphor for parenthood, he compared the premise to US politics in 2018, \"I think in our political situation, that's what's going on now: You can close your eyes and stick your head in the sand, or you can try to participate in whatever's going on.\" He cited Jaws (1975) as an influence, with how the protagonist police officer moved from New York to an island to avoid frightening situations, and

They have managed to adapt to their new world, but they know that they cannot stay hidden forever. One day, Regan discovers that she can hear the creatures, and she becomes determined to find a way to communicate with them. As the family tries to navigate their new reality, they begin to face challenges and obstacles that test their courage and resilience.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a talented cast of actors, including John Krasinski, Emily Blunt, Millicent Simmonds, and Noah Jupe. Krasinski and Blunt are married in real life, and they star together in the film as the parents of the Abbott family. Simmonds, who is deaf, plays the role of Regan, the deaf daughter of the family. Jupe plays the role of Marcus, the son of the family.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe film was shot in 36 days, and production took place from May to November 2017 in Dutchess and Ulster counties in upstate New York. The filmmakers spent their budget locally, including a purchase of 20 tons of corn, which they hired local farmers to grow. Some filming took place on a soundstage in the town of Pawling in Dutchess County, as well as on-location in the county's city of Beacon. Filming also took place on the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail in New Paltz of Ulster County, using the Springtown Truss Bridge.\n\n**Sound and Music**\n\nDuring filming, the crew avoided making noise so that diegetic synchronized sounds (e.g., the sound of rolling dice on a game board) could be recorded. The sounds were amplified in post-production. A musical score was added to the film, which Krasinski justified in wanting audiences to have a cinematic experience and some familiarity with a traditional film component, instead of feeling like they're part of a \"silence experiment.\" Some music was cut from the film, which Krasinski found more impactful than having the score dominate scenes.\n\n**Use of Sign Language**\n\nThe characters communicate in American Sign Language (ASL) to avoid making sound, and the filmmakers hired deaf mentor Douglas Ridloff to teach ASL to the actors and to be available to make corrections. They also hired an ASL interpreter for deaf actress Simmonds, so that spoken and signed language could be interpreted back and forth on set. Simmonds grew up with ASL, and she helped teach her fellow actors to sign.\n\n**Creature Design**\n\nProduction designer Jeffrey Beecroft headed the creature design, and Industrial Light & Magic created the creatures, led by visual effects supervisor Scott Farrar. The director wanted the creatures to look like they had evolved to no longer need eyes, and to be \"somewhat humanoid\" in nature. Farrar said the initial creature design showed them with rhinoceros-like horns out of their faces, but later redesigns omitted this because it was not scary enough.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nParamount Pictures released the first trailer for A Quiet Place in November 2017. It aired a 30-second commercial for the film during the US football championship Super Bowl LII on February 4, 2018.

Variety reported on March 27 that the film \"is tracking to open between\" $16 million and $30 million, which reached a basement of low-$20 million by the week of its release.\n\n**Theatrical Run**\n\nA Quiet Place was first commercially released in theaters in the first week of April 2018 in multiple territories, including North America.

commentary the film encouraged, Krasinski said, \"That's not what I was going for, but the best compliment you can get on any movie is that it starts a conversation The fact that people are leaving and talking about anything is really fun—but certainly about deep stuff like that, is awesome.\" [93] Krasinski, who did not grow up with horror films, said that prior films of the genre such as Don't Breathe (2016) and Get Out (2017) that had societal commentary were part of his research In addition to considering his film a metaphor for parenthood, he compared the premise to US politics in 2018, \"I think in our political situation, that's what's going on now: You can close your eyes and stick your head in the sand, or you can try to participate in whatever's going on.\" He cited Jaws (1975) as an influence, with how the protagonist police officer moved from New York to an island to avoid frightening situations, and was forced to encounter one in his new location with shark attacks

Newton**\n\nHuey Percy Newton was a prominent figure in the Black Panther Party, a civil rights organization that emerged in the 1960s in the United States. Born in 1942 in Monroe, Louisiana, Newton's life was marked by a complex mix of activism, violence, and scholarly pursuits.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nNewton was born in Monroe, Louisiana, during World War II. His parents, Armelia Johnson and Walter Newton, were a sharecropper and a Baptist preacher, respectively. Monroe is located in Ouachita Parish, which has a history of violence against Black people dating back to the Reconstruction era. According to a report by the Equal Justice Initiative, from 1877 to 1950, a total of 37 Black people were documented as lynched in that parish. This was the fifth-highest total of lynchings of any county in the Southern United States.\n\nNewton's early life was marked by poverty and violence. He was the youngest of five children, and his family struggled to make ends meet. Despite these challenges, Newton's parents instilled in him a strong sense of morality and a desire to learn. He attended the local high school and later enrolled in the University of California at Berkeley, where he studied sociology.\n\n**Founding of the Black Panther Party**\n\nAs a student at Merritt College in Oakland, California, Newton became involved in Bay Area politics. He joined the Afro-American Association (AAA), became a prominent member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity's Beta Tau chapter, and played a role in getting the first African-American history course adopted as part of the college's curriculum. Newton learned about black history from Donald Warden, the leader of the AAA, but later concluded that Warden offered solutions that didn't work.\n\nNewton's involvement in the AAA and his studies at Merritt College laid the groundwork for the formation of the Black Panther Party. In 1966, Newton and Bobby Seale founded the party, which aimed to empower Black people and challenge systemic racism. The party's Ten-Point Program, written by Newton, outlined the group's goals, including the right to self-defense, full employment, and an end to police brutality.\n\n**Fatal Shooting of John Frey**\n\nIn 1967, Newton was involved in a fatal shooting of an Oakland Police Department officer, John Frey. Newton had been convicted of assault with a deadly weapon for repeatedly stabbing another man, Odell Lee, with a steak knife in mid-1964. He served six months in prison. By October 27-28, 1967, he was out celebrating the release from his probationary period. Just before dawn on October 28, Newton and a friend were pulled over by Officer Frey. Realizing who Newton was, Frey called for backup. After fellow officer Herbert Heanes arrived, shots were fired, and all three were wounded.\n\nNewton was arrested on the day of the shooting and pled not guilty to the murder of Officer Frey. The Black Panther Party immediately went to work organizing a coalition to rally behind Newton and champion his release.\n\n**\"Free Huey!\" Campaign**\n\nThe \"Free Huey!\" campaign was a national movement that aimed to raise awareness about Newton's case and secure his release. In December 1967, the Peace and Freedom Party, a majority white anti-war political organization, joined with the Black Panther Party in support of Newton. This alliance served the dual purpose of legitimizing Newton's cause while boosting the credibility of the party within the community of more radical activists.\n\n**Visit to China**\n\nIn 1970, after his release from prison, Newton received an invitation to visit the People's Republic of China. Learning of Nixon's plan to visit China in 1972, Newton decided to visit before him. He made the trip in late September 1971 with fellow Panthers, Elaine Brown and Robert Bay, and stayed for 10 days. At every Chinese airport he landed in, Newton was greeted by thousands of people waving copies of the \"Little Red Book\" (officially titled Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung) and displaying signs that said, \"We support the Black Panther Party, down with U.S imperialism,\" or, \"We support the American people but the Nixon imperialist regime must be overthrown.\"\n\n**Peoples Temple of the Disciples of Christ**\n\nIn January 1977, Jim Jones, leader of the Peoples Temple of the Disciples of Christ (commonly shortened to the Peoples Temple), visited Newton in Havana, Cuba.\n\n**Allegations of Violence**\n\nBy the 1970s, Newton had allegedly become increasingly paranoid, addicted to crack cocaine, and prone to violent behavior.\n\n**Murder**\n\nIn the early hours of August 22, 1989, Newton was murdered in front of 1456 9th Street, near the corner of Center Street in the Prescott section of Oakland, California. Within days, Tyrone Robinson was arrested as a suspect; he was on parole and admitted the murder to police, claiming self-defense, though police found no evidence that Newton was carrying a gun. In 1991, Robinson was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to a prison term of 32 years to life.\n\n**Writing and Scholarship**\n\nNewton received a bachelor's degree from the University of California at Santa Cruz in 1974. In 1978, while in prison, Newton met evolutionary biologist Robert Trivers after Newton applied to do a reading course with Trivers as part of a graduate degree in history of consciousness. They became close friends and published an analysis of the role of flight crew self-deception in the 1982 crash of Air Florida Flight 90.\n\n**Works**\n\nNewton's life and legacy have been the subject of numerous books, films, and documentaries. His impact on American history and the Black Panther Party's struggle for social justice continues to be felt today.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nNewton's image and legacy have been referenced in popular culture, from music to film. His story has inspired countless artists, writers, and activists, cementing his place as a cultural icon of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Black Panther Party\n* Huey P.

investigators [3] However, the Russia national team could still enter qualification, as the ban only applies to the World Cup proper as a world championship The WADA ruling allowed athletes who were not involved in doping or the coverup to compete, but prohibited the use of the Russian flag and anthem at major international sporting events [4] An appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport was filed, [5] but WADA's decision was upheld though reduced to a two-year ban [6] The CAS ruling also allowed the name \"Russia\" to be displayed on uniforms if the words \"Neutral Athlete\" or \"Neutral Team\" have equal prominence [7] If Russia had qualified for the tournament, its players would not have been able to use their country's name alone, flag or anthem at the World Cup, as a result of the

{"title": "2023_Sudan_conflict", "content": "\nBackground\nSudan has been inhabited since prehistory and has seen many conflicts, with foreign invasions and resistance, ethnic tensions, religious disputes, and disputes over resources throughout antiquity and the middle ages [32] [33] Sudan was conquered by Egypt in 1821, and in 1881 the religious leader Muhammad Ahmad led a nationalist revolt and established an \"Islamic and national\" Mahdist State in much of the territory of modern Sudan [34] After Ahmad's death, a British-Egyptian force commanded by Lord Kitchener retook Sudan In 1899, the country became a condominium of Egypt and the United Kingdom, but was de facto ruled by the UK alone and would remain under British control until 1956, when it gained independence and inherited its pre-1911 borders In 1916, after the British government suspected that the Sultanate of Darfur was falling under the influence of the Ottoman government, an expedition was launched from Egypt to capture and annex Darfur into the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan The colonial government directed financial and administrative resources to the tribes of central Sudan near Khartoum, while the outlying regions such as Darfur remained mostly forgotten and ignored [35]\n\n\nWar in Darfur and the formation of the RSF\nBy the turn of the 21st century, Sudan's western Darfur region had endured prolonged instability and social strife due to racial and ethnic tensions and disputes over land and water In 2003, this situation erupted into a full-scale rebellion against government rule, against which president and military strongman Omar al-Bashir vowed to use forceful action The resulting War in Darfur was marked by widespread state-sponsored acts of violence, leading to charges of war crimes and genocide against al-Bashir [40] The initial phase of the conflict left approximately 300,000 dead and 2.7 million forcibly displaced; even though the intensity of the violence later declined, the situation in the region remained far from peaceful [41]\n\n\nPolitical transition\nIn December 2018, protests against al-Bashir's regime began, starting the first phase of the Sudanese Revolution Eight months of sustained civil disobedience were met with violent repression [49] In April 2019, the military (including the RSF) ousted al-Bashir in a coup d'état, ending his three decades of rule; the army established the Transitional Military Council, a junta [45] [46] [49] Bashir was imprisoned in Khartoum; he was not turned over to the ICC, which had issued warrants for his arrest on charges of war crimes [50] Protests calling for civilian rule continued; in June 2019, the TMC's security forces, which included both the RSF and the SAF, perpetrated the Khartoum massacre, in which more than a hundred demonstrators were killed [51] [43] [45] [49] and dozens were raped [43] Hemedti denied orchestrating the attack [45]\n\n\nOrigins of the SPLM-N and the SLM\nThe Sudan Liberation Movement (or Army; SLM, SLA, or SLM/A) is a rebel group active in Darfur, primarily composed of members of non-Arab ethnic groups [53] and established in response to their marginalization by the Bashir regime [54] [55] Since 2006, the movement has split into several factions due to disagreements over the Darfur Peace Agreement, with some factions joining the government in Khartoum [56] [57] [58] By 2023 the three most prominent factions were the SLM-Minnawi under Minni Minnawi, the SLM-al-Nur under Abdul Wahid al-Nur, and the SLM-Tambour under Mustafa Tambour The SLM-Minnawi and SLM-Tambour signed the 2020 Juba Peace Agreement, ceasing hostilities and receiving political appointments, but the SLM-al-Nur refused to sign and kept fighting [59] [60]\n\n\nPrelude\nIn the months after the 2021 coup the already weak Sudanese economy steeply declined, fueling wide protests demanding that the junta return power to civilian authorities [66] Tensions arose between al-Burhan and Hemedti over al-Burhan's restoration to the office of old-guard Islamist officials who had dominated the Omar al-Bashir government Hemedti saw the appointment of these officials as a signal that al-Burhan was attempting to maintain the dominance of Khartoum's traditional elite over Sudanese politics This was a danger to the RSF's political position, as said elites were hostile to Hemedti due to his ethnic background as a Darfuri Arab [67] Hemedti's expression of regret over the October 2021 coup signalled a widening divide between him and al-Burhan [52]\n\n\nCourse of the war\nOn 15 April 2023, the RSF attacked SAF bases across Sudan, including Khartoum and its airport [70] [75] There were clashes at the headquarters of the state broadcaster, Sudan TV, which was later captured by RSF forces [76] Bridges and roads in Khartoum and its hinterland were closed by RSF command [77] The next day saw a SAF counteroffensive, with the army retaking Merowe Airport alongside the headquarters of Sudan TV and the state radio [78] [79]\n\n\nApril–May 2023\nOn 15 April 2023, the RSF attacked SAF bases across Sudan, including Khartoum and its airport [70] [75] There were clashes at the headquarters of the state broadcaster, Sudan TV, which was later captured by RSF forces [76] Bridges and roads in Khartoum and its hinterland were closed by RSF command [77] The next day saw a SAF counteroffensive, with the army retaking Merowe Airport alongside the headquarters of Sudan TV and the state radio [78] [79]\n\n\nBattle of Khartoum\nOn 15 April 2023, the RSF attacked SAF bases across Sudan, including Khartoum and its airport [70] [75] There were clashes at the headquarters of the state broadcaster, Sudan TV, which was later captured by RSF forces [76] Bridges and roads in Khartoum and its hinterland were closed by RSF command [77] The next day saw a SAF counteroffensive, with the army retaking Merowe Airport alongside the headquarters of Sudan TV and the state radio [78] [79]\n\n\nTreaty of Jeddah\nInternational attention to the conflict resulted in the United Nations Human Rights Council calling a special session to address the violence, voting to increase monitoring of human rights abuses [100] On 6 May, delegates from the SAF and the RSF met directly for the first time in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for what was described by Saudi Arabia and the United States as \"pre-negotiation talks\" [101] After diplomatic lobbying from the Saudis and Americans the warring sides signed the Treaty of Jeddah on 20 May, vowing to ensure the safe passage of civilians, protect relief workers, and prohibit the use of civilians as human shields [102] The agreement did not include a ceasefire, and clashes resumed in Geneina, causing more casualties [102] The United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths expressed frustration at the lack of commitment from both sides to end the fighting [103]\n\n\nJune–September 2023\nAs June began, Khartoum witnessed tank battles resulting in casualties [110] [111] The RSF took control of several important cultural and government buildings, including the National Museum of Sudan and the Yarmouk Military Industrial Complex [112] [113] Acute food insecurity affected a significant portion of Sudan's population [114]\n\n\nContinued fighting in Khartoum\nAs June began, Khartoum witnessed tank battles resulting in casualties [110] [111] The RSF took control of several important cultural and government buildings, including the National Museum of Sudan and the Yarmouk Military Industrial Complex [112] [113] Acute food insecurity affected a significant portion of Sudan's population [114]\n\n\nDiplomatic efforts\nCeasefires between the warring parties were announced but often violated, leading to further clashes The SAF and RSF engaged in mutual blame for incidents, while the Sudanese government took action against international envoys [127] The Saudi embassy in Khartoum was attacked and evacuations from an orphanage were carried out amid the chaos [128] Amidst the turmoil, Sudan faced diplomatic strains with Egypt, leading to challenges for Sudanese refugees seeking entry [129] [130]\n\n\nSPLM-N (Al-Hilu) involvement\nThe Abdelaziz al-Hilu faction of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement–North (SPLM-N) broke a long-standing ceasefire agreement in June, attacking SAF units in Kadugli, Kurmuk and Dalang, the latter coinciding with an attack by the RSF The SAF claimed to have repelled the attacks, [27] [6] while the rebels claimed to have attacked in retaliation for the death of one of their soldiers at the hands of the SAF and vowed to free the region from \"military occupation\" [63] More than 35,000 were displaced by the fighting [63] Speculation arose as to whether the attacks were part of an unofficial alliance between al-Hilu and the RSF or an attempt by al-Hilu to strengthen his position in future negotiations concerning his group [135] Civil society organizations supporting the SPLM-N claimed its operations sought to protect civilians from possible attacks by the RSF [136]\n\n\nDarfur front\nIn Darfur, fighting and bloodshed were particularly fierce around the city of Geneina, where hundreds died and extensive destruction occurred [140] RSF forces engaged in frequent acts of violence against the Masalit population of Geneina, leading to accusations of ethnic cleansing [141] On 4 August the RSF claimed that it had taken full control over all of Central Darfur [142]\n\n\nOctober–December 2023\nBy October 2023, the SAF in Darfur was experiencing acute shortages in supplies due to RSF-imposed sieges and had failed to utilize its air superiority to stem RSF advances [153] On 26 October, the RSF captured Nyala, Sudan's fourth-largest city, after seizing control of the SAF's 16th Infantry Division headquarters [154] The fall of Nyala, a strategic city with an international airport and border connections to Central Africa, allowed the RSF to receive international supplies more easily and concentrate its forces on other Sudanese cities [155] After Nyala's fall, RSF fighters turned their focus to Zalingei, the capital of Central Darfur The SAF's 21st Infantry Division, stationed in Zalingei, fled the city without a fight and allowed the RSF to take it over [156]\n\n\nSAF collapse in Darfur\nBy October 2023, the SAF in Darfur was experiencing acute shortages in supplies due to RSF-imposed sieges and had failed to utilize its air superiority to stem RSF advances [153] On 26 October, the RSF captured Nyala, Sudan's fourth-largest city, after seizing control of the SAF's 16th Infantry Division headquarters [154] The fall of Nyala, a strategic city with an international airport and border connections to Central Africa, allowed the RSF to receive international supplies more easily and concentrate its forces on other Sudanese cities [155] After Nyala's fall, RSF fighters turned their focus to Zalingei, the capital of Central Darfur The SAF's 21st Infantry Division, stationed in Zalingei, fled the city without a fight and allowed the RSF to take it over [156]\n\n\nPeace negotiations stall\nAttempts by other nations and international organisations to negotiate peace had largely been dormant since the failure of the Treaty of Jeddah, but in late October the RSF and SAF met once more in Jeddah to attempt to negotiate peace [166] This new round of talks was a failure, with neither side willing to commit to a ceasefire Instead, the warring factions agreed to open channels for humanitarian aid [167] On 3 December negotiations were indefinitely suspended due to the failure of both the SAF and the RSF to open up aid channels [168]\n\n\nRSF Crossing of the Nile\nThe RSF attacked the town of Wad Ashana in North Kordofan on 1 October along a key commercial route [171] [172] In West Kordofan, an uptick in fighting was reported, with the RSF assaulting a \"vital\" oil field in Baleela, south of Al-Fulah [173] Geolocated footage showed RSF fighters celebrating around Baleela Airport after allegedly capturing it [174] The Battle of Khartoum continued with the RSF seizing the town of al-Aylafoun, southeast of the capital, on 6 October In the process, the paramilitary gained control of key oil infrastructure [175] [176] By late October the RSF controlled most of Khartoum but had failed to seize key military bases, while al-Burhan's government had largely relocated to Port Sudan [177]\n\n\nJanuary–April 2024\nFollowing the fall of Wad Madani efforts by IGAD to negotiate a ceasefire made progress, as the SAF's weakened position made them more eager to enter talks Whereas previously opposition from Islamist political groups to negotiation had prevented al-Burhan from committing to a specific date, now both he and Hemedti agreed to meet on 28 December [186] [191] A day before the meeting was due, it was cancelled as Hemedti recanted his desire to attend [192]\n\n\nHemedti travels abroad\nFollowing the fall of Wad Madani efforts by IGAD to negotiate a ceasefire made progress, as the SAF's weakened position made them more eager to enter talks Whereas previously opposition from Islamist political groups to negotiation had prevented al-Burhan from committing to a specific date, now both he and Hemedti agreed to meet on 28 December [186] [191] A day before the meeting was due, it was cancelled as Hemedti recanted his desire to attend [192]\n\n\nFighting in Kordofan and Gezira\nAs 2024 began the RSF made attacks into South Kordofan, defeating SAF forces in the town of Habila in the Nuba Mountains and pushing toward Dalang [197] On 7 January the RSF attacked SAF positions in Dalang, meeting fierce resistance from the army and civilian militias [190] [198] During the fighting the SPLM-N (al-Hilu) entered the city, taking control of several neighbourhoods SPLM-N forces proceeded to attack the RSF, and the paramilitary retreated from the city [199] RSF fighters withdrawing from Dalang entered the city of Muglad in West Kordofan, easily taking control as the city had no organised SAF presence West Kordofan had been relatively free of fighting for several months due to a local truce brokered by leaders of the Messiria tribe, but as tensions escalated rumours spread that the RSF was planning an attack on the encircled city of Babanusa and the SAF 22nd Infantry Division garrisoning it [199]\n\n\nSAF gains in Omdurman\nThe SAF gained ground in Omdurman in February 2024, linking up their forces in the northern part of the city and relieving a 10-month siege of their forces in the city centre The SAF also took control of the Al-Hilal Stadium [206] As of February 2024, the Omdurman front is the only area in Sudan where the SAF has carried out a sustained offensive operation and represents the first breakthrough for the SAF [206]\n\n\nApril 2024–present\nOn 15 April, during the Battle of El Fasher, at least nine civilians were killed in a renewed offensive by the RSF on the city of Al-Fashir in North Darfur [210] The Joint Darfur Force declared war on the RSF and allied with the SAF [211] [212]\n\n\nFighting in Darfur\nOn 15 April, during the Battle of El Fasher, at least nine civilians were killed in a renewed offensive by the RSF on the city of Al-Fashir in North Darfur [210] The Joint Darfur Force declared war on the RSF and allied with the SAF [211] [212]\n\n\nFighting in Kordofan\nAs of May 2024, fighting is ongoing in Babanusa, West Kordofan The RSF is conducting an offensive to attempt to take control of West Kordofan [219] Fighting was also reported in North Kordofan [220]\n\n\nFighting along the Nile\nIn May 2024, the RSF launched attacks against the SAF between Khartoum State and River Nile State, as well as in White Nile State near the border with Gezira State The SAF prepared its forces in River Nile State, ahead of a potential invasion of Khartoum Bahri [222] In June 2024, the RSF was still in control of Khartoum and Khartoum North, though the SAF controlled one enclave in each that it supplies by airdrop [223]\n\n\nSAF offensives\nAs September 2024 came, for the first time since the start of the war the balance of power seemed to be tipping towards the SAF On 26 September, the SAF launched a major offensive against RSF positions in Khartoum [232] The attack on the city came from three fronts striking from the south, east and west of the capital [233] SAF airstrikes, which killed four and wounded 14, began at dawn followed by clashes within the city The SAF reportedly captured three key bridges connecting Khartoum to other nearby cities, including the Omdurman Bridge which had previously acted as a line of separation between government and RSF control [234] [235] Faced with an elusive enemy, the SAF became bogged down in urban fighting - with RSF snipers routinely paralyzing infantry advances [233]\n\n\nCasualties\nAccording to a report published by Le Monde in November 2024, the war may have killed over 150,000 civilians through the combined tolls of bombardments, massacres, starvation and disease [233] A November 2024 report from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine estimated more than 61,000 deaths in Khartoum State alone, for the period between April 2023 and June 2024 [239]\n\n\nDarfur\nIn Geneina, West Darfur, ethnic clashes that began in the last week of April 2023 had killed at least 1,100 people, [245] while the Sultanate of Dar Masalit claimed that more than 5,000 people were killed and about 8,000 were wounded in the city [241] In July 2023, a Masalit tribal leader claimed that more than 10,000 people had been killed in West Darfur alone, and that 80% of Geneina's residents had fled [242]\n\n\nEastern Sudan\nIn July 2023, authorities reported at least 88 cases of sexual assault on women across the country, most of them blamed on the RSF [249] NGOs estimated that the figure could possibly reach 4,400 [250] Activist Hala al-Karib stated that war rape had become an everyday occurrence with both fighting parties participating [251] In 2024, Al Jazeera reported that Sudanese women were forced to exchange sex for food or become mistresses to RSF fighters to ensure their families’ safety and access to food [252]\n\n\nSexual violence\nIn July 2023, authorities reported at least 88 cases of sexual assault on women across the country, most of them blamed on the RSF [249] NGOs estimated that the figure could possibly reach 4,400 [250] Activist Hala al-Karib stated that war rape had become an everyday occurrence with both fighting parties participating [251] In 2024, Al Jazeera reported that Sudanese women were forced to exchange sex for food or become mistresses to RSF fighters to ensure their families’ safety and access to food [252]\n\n\nCasualties among humanitarian workers\nIn the Battle of Kabkabiya, three employees of the World Food Programme (WFP) were killed after being caught in the crossfire at a military base Two other staff members were injured [256] On 18 April 2023, the EU's top humanitarian aid officer in Sudan, Wim Fransen of Belgium, was shot and injured in Khartoum [257] On 21 April 2023, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported that one of its local employees was killed in a crossfire while traveling with his family near El-Obeid [258] On 20 July 2023, an 18-member team of Médecins Sans Frontières was attacked while transporting supplies to the Turkish Hospital in south Khartoum By then, the World Health Organization had verified 51 attacks on medical facilities and personnel since the conflict began, resulting in 10 deaths and 24 injuries [259] On 25 July 2023, Humanitarian Coordinator Clementine Nkweta-Salami said 18 aid workers had been killed and over two dozen others were detained or unaccounted for [260] The conflict has led the United Nations to declare Sudan the most dangerous country in the world for humanitarian workers after South Sudan [261]\n\n\nAttacks on journalists\nThe SAF and RSF are accused of threatening, attacking, and killing journalists during the conflict The Sudanese Journalists Syndicate documented over 40 violations in May alone Several journalists were injured or killed, and 13 newspapers ceased operations Humanitarian workers were also targeted, with 18 killed and many others detained.\n\n\nForeign casualties\nCivilians, including 15 Syrians, [281] 15 Ethiopians [280] and 9 Eritreans [283] have been killed across the country An Indian national working in

and had their possessions stolen on 13 June [284] Ten students from the Democratic Republic of the Congo were killed in an SAF airstrike on the International University of Africa in Khartoum on 4 June [282] The SAF claimed that the Egyptian assistant military attaché was killed by RSF fire while driving his car in Khartoum, which was refuted by the Egyptian ambassador [289]\n\n\nNotable deaths\nOn 16 April 2023, the RSF claimed that its troops in Port Sudan were attacked by foreign aircraft and issued a warning against any foreign interference [304] According to former CIA analyst Cameron Hudson, Egyptian fighter jets were a part of these bombing campaigns against the RSF, and Egyptian special forces units have been deployed and are providing intelligence and tactical support to the SAF [305] The Wall Street Journal said that Egypt had sent fighter jets and pilots to support the Sudanese military [306] On 17 April, satellite imagery obtained by The War Zone revealed that one Egyptian Air Force MiG-29M2 fighter jet had been destroyed and two others had been damaged or destroyed at Merowe Airbase A Sudanese Air Force Guizhou JL-9 was among the destroyed aircraft [307] After initial confusion, the RSF accepted the explanation that Egyptian combat and support personnel were conducting exercises with the Sudanese military before the outbreak of hostilities [70]\n\n\nForeign involvement\nOn 16 April 2023, the RSF claimed that its troops in Port Sudan were attacked by foreign aircraft and issued a warning against any foreign interference [304] According to former CIA

destroyed aircraft [307] After initial confusion, the RSF accepted the explanation that Egyptian combat and support personnel were conducting exercises with the Sudanese military before the outbreak of hostilities [70]\n\n\nEgyptian POWs\nOn 15 April, RSF forces claimed, via Twitter, to have taken Egyptian troops prisoner near Merowe, [308] [309] and a military plane carrying markings of the Egyptian Air Force [310] Initially, no official explanation was given for the Egyptian soldiers' presence, while Egypt and Sudan have had military cooperation due to diplomatic tensions with Ethiopia [311] Later on, the Egyptian Armed Forces stated that around 200 of its soldiers were in Sudan to conduct exercises with the Sudanese military [70] Around that time, the SAF reportedly encircled RSF forces in Merowe airbase As a result, the Egyptian Armed Forces announced that it was following the situation as a precaution for the safety of its personnel [77] [312] [better source needed] The RSF later stated that it would cooperate in repatriating the soldiers to Egypt [310] On 19 April, the RSF stated that it had moved the soldiers to Khartoum and would hand them over when the \"appropriate opportunity\" arose [313] One hundred and seventy-seven of the captured Egyptian troops were released and flown back to Egypt aboard three Egyptian military planes that took off from Khartoum airport later in the day The remaining 27 soldiers, who were from the Egyptian Air Force, were sheltered at the Egyptian embassy and later evacuated [314] [315]\n\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\nA report published by the Wall Street Journal on 10 August 2023 quoted Ugandan officials as saying that an Emirati plane on a stopover at Entebbe Airport en route to Amdjarass International Airport in eastern Chad turned out upon inspection to have been carrying dozens of green plastic crates in the plane's cargo hold filled with ammunition, assault rifles and other small arms\", rather than food and other aid officially listed on the aircraft's manifest supposedly meant for Sudanese refugees Despite the discovery, the plane was allowed to take off, and the officials said they received orders from their superiors not to inspect any more planes from the UAE Before this, the UAE had long been accused of supporting the RSF The UAE Foreign Ministry subsequently denied the allegations, saying that the country \"does not take sides\" in the conflict [316]\n\n\nRussia\nFor much of the Sudanese civil war Russia has taken a generally neutral stance, not clearly backing either the RSF or SAF [345] This neutral attitude began to shift during mid-2024, with the Russian government beginning to favour the SAF, concurrent with the SAF emphasising its support for the construction of a Russian naval base north of Port Sudan [345] This move by the SAF was calculated to exploit tensions between Russia and western powers following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, offering the Russian government an opportunity to expand its international military influence in exchange for an international ally willing to both oppose the United Arab Emirates and provide significant weaponry [345] The SAF had at this stage of the conflict suffered several successive defeats at the hands of the RSF, making them more eager to make concessions to win international support [346]\n\n\nWagner Group\nAccording to CNN, Wagner supplied surface-to-air missiles to the RSF, picking up the items from Syria and delivering some of them by plane to Haftar-controlled bases in Libya to be then delivered to the RSF, while dropping other items directly to RSF positions in northwestern Sudan [347] American officials said that Wagner was offering to supply additional weapons to the RSF from its existing stocks in the Central African Republic [348] On 6 September, Wagner reportedly deployed a convoy of more than 100 vehicles carrying weapons to the RSF garrison in al-Zurug from Chad [349] SAF Lieutenant General Yasser al-Atta also accused the Wagner Group of bringing in mercenaries from several African nations to fight alongside the RSF [318]\n\n\nIran\nIn June 2024, a BBC investigation found evidence of the involvement of Iran and the UAE in violating the UN arms embargo by providing drones in the Sudanese conflict In March 2024, a piece of video evidence showed that Sudanese soldiers recaptured the state broadcaster's headquarters in Khartoum with the assistance of Iranian-made drones A drone expert, Wim Zwijnenburg also observed that an army drone shot down by the RSF in January 2024 resembled the Iranian-made Mohajer-6 drone Evidence also revealed the use of quadcopter drones by the RSF, which Brian Castner claimed belonged to the UAE The drones are capable of dropping 120mm motor shells, are had been supplied by the Emirates to its allies in the Yemen and Ethiopian wars [330]\n\n\nOther foreign actors\nOn 7 June 2023, Hissein Alamine Tchaw-tchaw, a Chadian dissident who belongs to the same ethnic group as Hemedti and claims to be the leader of the Movement for the Fight of the Oppressed in Chad (MFOC), which is fighting the government of President Mahamat Déby, posted a video showing his participation in an RSF attack on the Yarmouk munitions factory in Khartoum [360]\n\n\nChad\nOn 7 June 2023, Hissein Alamine Tchaw-tchaw, a Chadian dissident who belongs to the same ethnic group as Hemedti and claims to be the leader of the Movement for the Fight of the Oppressed in Chad (MFOC), which is fighting the government of President Mahamat Déby, posted a video showing his participation in an RSF attack on the Yarmouk munitions factory in Khartoum [360]\n\n\nKenya\nThe SAF rejected Kenya's involvement in mediation efforts to end the conflict in July after al-Burhan accused President William Ruto of having a business relationship with Hemedti and providing a haven to the RSF [366] [367] In response to proposals for a peacekeeping force composed by African countries to be deployed in Sudan made in an Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) committee chaired by Ruto, the SAF's Assistant Commander-in-Chief Lieutenant General Yasir Alatta accused Ruto of being a mercenary of another country, whom he did not identify, and dared Ruto to deploy the Kenyan army and that of his alleged backer [368] On 7 September, the Sudanese government threatened to withdraw the country's membership in IGAD unless Ruto was removed as chairman of the mediation committee [369]\n\n\nLibyan National Army\nThe Egypt-backed Libyan National Army, under the command of Khalifa Haftar, dispatched aircraft to fly military supplies to the RSF before the outbreak of hostilities [373] [306] Haftar and the LNA collaborated with the Wagner Group, a Russian private military company, to conduct these flights [373]\n\n\nUkraine\nOn 19 September 2023, CNN reported that it was \"likely\" that Ukrainian special forces were behind a series of drone strikes and a ground operation directed against the Wagner Group-backed RSF near Khartoum on 8 September [349] Kyrylo Budanov, the chief of the Ukrainian Main Directorate of Intelligence, stated in an interview on 22 September that he could neither confirm or deny Ukraine's involvement in the conflict, [375] but said that Ukraine \"will be seeking and hunting down Russian military criminals .. sooner or later\" [376]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nIn June 2024, The Guardian reported that according to multiple sources, UK government officials \"attempted to suppress criticism\" of the United Arab Emirates and its alleged role in supplying arms to the RSF [380] Furthermore, the UK is the UN Security Council's \"penholder\" [381] for Sudan [380] In early 2023, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office initiated secret talks between the RSF and the UK [382]\n\n\nEvacuation of foreign nationals\nThe outbreak of violence has led foreign governments to monitor the situation in Sudan and move toward the evacuation and repatriation of their nationals Among some countries with several expatriates in Sudan are Egypt, which has more than 10,000 citizens in the country, [383] and the United States, which has more than 16,000 citizens, most of whom are dual nationals [384] Efforts at extraction were hampered by the fighting within the capital Khartoum, particularly in and around the airport This has forced evacuations to be undertaken by road via Port Sudan on the Red Sea, which lies about 650 km (400 miles) northeast of Khartoum [385] from where they were airlifted or ferried directly to their home countries or third ones Other evacuations were undertaken through overland border crossings or airlifts from diplomatic missions and other designated locations with direct involvement of the militaries of some home countries Some transit hubs used during the evacuation include the port of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia and Djibouti, which hosts military bases of the United States, China, Japan, France, and other European countries [386]\n\n\nSanctions\nThe repeated violations of the ceasefire agreements and other atrocities during the conflict led to U.S President Joe Biden issuing an executive order on 4 May 2023 authorizing sanctions for those deemed responsible for destabilizing Sudan, undermining the democratic transition and committing human rights abuses [387] On 1 June, the US government imposed its first sanctions related to the conflict, targeting two firms associated with the SAF and two others linked to the RSF It also imposed visa restrictions against individuals involved in the violence but did not divulge any names [388]\n\n\nUnited States\nThe repeated violations of the ceasefire agreements and other atrocities during the conflict led to U.S President Joe

for providing funds and weapons in the conflict [394] On 15 April 2024, Canada imposed sanctions on two individuals and four entities linked to the SAF and the RSF [395] On 23 June 2024, the European Union imposed sanctions on six entities for manufacturing and procuring weapons for the SAF and the RSF [396]\n\n\nHumanitarian impact\nThe humanitarian crisis following the fighting was further exacerbated by the violence occurring during a period of high temperatures, and drought starting during the fasting month of Ramadan Civilians were unable to venture outside of their homes to obtain food and supplies for fear of getting caught in the crossfire A doctors' group said that hospitals remained understaffed and were running low on supplies as wounded people streamed in [397] The World Health Organization (WHO) recorded around 26 attacks on healthcare facilities, some of which resulted in casualties among medical workers and civilians [398] The WHO said 80% of hospitals in conflict areas were out of service [399] with 32 forcibly evacuated by soldiers or caught in the crossfire [400] This included about half of Khartoum's 130 medical facilities and all hospitals in West Darfur [401] Outbreaks of diseases such as measles, cholera and diarrhea were reported across the country [402] In August 2024 cholera was declared an epidemic in the country and as of 8 September 2024 [update], there were 5,692 cases of cholera including 185 deaths [403]\n\n\nRefugees\nAs of July 2024, nearly 10 million residents of Sudan have been displaced due to the fighting The United Nations said that the conflict had produced more than 7.7 million internally displaced persons (IDPs), while more than 2.1 million had fled the country altogether as of June 2024 [21] [20] This made Sudan the largest host of IDPs globally [414] The International Organization for Migration estimated that around 36% of IDPs came from the Khartoum region [21] In November, the UN said the conflict created the largest child displacement crisis in the world, affecting three million children [415]\n\n\nEconomic impact\nThe UN estimated that economic activity in Sudan fell by more than a third during the first three weeks of the conflict [420] In July, Sudanese economists estimated the total amount of damage brought by the conflict at $9 billion, or an average of $100 million per day, while the value of property and goods looted was estimated at another $40 billion, with the most affected areas being Khartoum and South Darfur [421] The exchange rate of the US dollar against the Sudanese pound in the black market rose to SDG730 in September, while it reached SDG625 at the official rate This later reached SDG1250 in February 2024 The formal economy was described as being in a \"near standstill\" [422] [420] Gold production was also reduced to just 2 tons from the previous year's output of 18 tons [423] Sudanese minister for minerals Mohamed Bashir Abu Nammu accused the RSF of looting around 15 tons of silver and 1,273 kilograms of gold from the Sudan Gold Refinery at the start of the conflict [424]\n\n\nWar crimes investigations\nBoth the SAF and the RSF are accused of committing war crimes [427] The RSF in particular have been denounced by Human Rights Watch and numerous governments for committing crimes against humanity [428]\n\n\nDisinformation\nDuring the conflict, many instances of disinformation were observed, which aimed to manipulate public opinion, spread false narratives, and create confusion Both the SAF and the RSF engaged in disinformation campaigns on social media platforms [440] The RSF heavily relied on tweets and inauthentic behaviour to spread its agenda and influence local and international opinions The SAF used Twitter to refute RSF claims and boost army morale with false victory claims [440] The RSF had dedicated teams based in Khartoum and Dubai to engage in a digital propaganda war They used social media, including officially verified Facebook and Twitter accounts, to showcase their activities and spread disinformation [441]\n\n\nExamples\nOn 14 April, the official SAF social media page published a video which it said was of operations carried out by the Sudanese Air Force against the RSF Al Jazeera's monitoring and verification unit claimed the video had been fabricated using footage from the video game Arma 3 that was published on TikTok in March 2023 The unit claimed the video showing Sudanese army commander Abdel Fattah al-Burhan inspecting the Armoured Corps, in Al-Shajara, was from before the fighting A video reportedly of helicopters flying over Khartoum to participate in operations by the SAF against the RSF, which circulated on social media, turned out to be from November 2022 [444]\n\n\nResponses\nOn 11 August, Facebook shut down the main pages of the RSF due to a violation of its policy, \"Dangerous Organizations and Individuals\" In an alternate account, the RSF accused the SAF of lodging complaints based on false reports that led to the removal of its pages and said it was in contact with Facebook's parent company Meta Platforms to restore them [454]\n\n\nIn popular

has seen many conflicts, with foreign invasions and resistance, ethnic tensions, religious disputes, and disputes over resources throughout antiquity and the middle ages [32] [33] Sudan was conquered by Egypt in 1821, and in 1881 the religious leader Muhammad Ahmad led a nationalist revolt and established an \"Islamic and national\" Mahdist State in much of the territory of modern Sudan [34] After Ahmad's death, a British-Egyptian force commanded by Lord Kitchener retook Sudan In 1899, the country became a condominium of Egypt and the United Kingdom, but was de facto ruled by the UK alone and would remain under British control until 1956, when it gained independence and inherited its pre-1911 borders In 1916, after the British government suspected that the Sultanate of Darfur was falling under the influence of the Ottoman government, an expedition was launched from Egypt to capture and annex Darfur into the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan The colonial government directed financial and administrative resources to the tribes of central Sudan near Khartoum, while the outlying regions such as Darfur remained mostly forgotten and ignored [35]\n\n\nWar in Darfur and the formation of the RSF\nBy the turn of the 21st century, Sudan's western Darfur region had endured prolonged instability and social strife due to racial and ethnic tensions and disputes over land and water In 2003, this situation erupted into a full-scale rebellion against government rule, against which president and military strongman Omar al-Bashir vowed to use forceful action The resulting War in Darfur was marked by widespread state-sponsored acts of violence, leading to charges of war crimes and genocide against al-Bashir [40] The initial phase of the conflict left approximately 300,000 dead and 2.7 million forcibly displaced; even though the intensity of the violence later declined, the situation in the region remained far from peaceful [41]\n\n\nPolitical transition\nIn December 2018, protests against al-Bashir's regime began, starting the first phase of the Sudanese Revolution Eight months of sustained civil disobedience were met with violent repression [49] In April 2019, the military (including the RSF) ousted al-Bashir in a coup d'état, ending his three decades of rule; the army established the Transitional Military Council, a junta [45] [46] [49] Bashir was imprisoned in Khartoum; he was not turned over to the ICC, which had issued warrants for his arrest on charges of war crimes [50] Protests calling for civilian rule continued; in June 2019, the TMC's security forces, which included both the RSF and the SAF, perpetrated the Khartoum massacre, in which more than a hundred demonstrators were killed [51] [43] [45] [49] and dozens were raped [43] Hemedti denied orchestrating the attack [45]\n\n\nOrigins of the SPLM-N and the SLM\nThe Sudan Liberation Movement (or Army; SLM, SLA, or SLM/A) is a rebel group active in Darfur, primarily composed of members of non-Arab ethnic groups [53] and established in response to their marginalization by the Bashir regime [54] [55] Since 2006, the movement has split into several factions due to disagreements over the Darfur Peace Agreement, with some factions joining the government in Khartoum [56] [57] [58] By 2023 the three most prominent factions were the SLM-Minnawi under Minni Minnawi, the SLM-al-Nur under Abdul Wahid al-Nur, and the SLM-Tambour under Mustafa Tambour The SLM-Minnawi and SLM-Tambour signed the 2020 Juba Peace Agreement, ceasing hostilities and receiving political appointments, but the SLM-al-Nur refused to sign and kept fighting [59] [60]\n\n\nPrelude\nIn the months after the 2021 coup the already weak Sudanese economy steeply declined, fueling wide protests demanding that the junta return power to civilian authorities [66] Tensions arose between al-Burhan and Hemedti over al-Burhan's restoration to the office of old-guard Islamist officials who had dominated the Omar al-Bashir government Hemedti saw the appointment of these officials as a signal that al-Burhan was attempting to maintain the dominance of Khartoum's traditional elite over Sudanese politics This was a danger to the RSF's political position, as said elites were hostile to Hemedti due to his ethnic background as a Darfuri Arab [67] Hemedti's expression of regret over the October 2021 coup signalled a widening divide between him and al-Burhan [52]\n\n\nCourse of the war\nOn 15 April 2023, the RSF attacked SAF bases across Sudan, including Khartoum and its airport [70] [75] There were clashes at the headquarters of the state broadcaster, Sudan TV, which was later captured by RSF forces [76] Bridges and roads in Khartoum and its hinterland were closed by RSF command [77] The next day saw a SAF counteroffensive, with the army retaking Merowe Airport alongside the headquarters of Sudan TV and the state radio [78] [79]\n\n\nApril–May 2023\nOn 15 April 2023, the RSF attacked SAF bases across Sudan, including Khartoum and its airport [70] [75] There were clashes at the headquarters of the state broadcaster, Sudan TV, which was later captured by RSF forces [76] Bridges and roads in Khartoum and its hinterland were closed by RSF command [77] The next day saw a SAF counteroffensive, with the army retaking Merowe Airport alongside the headquarters of Sudan TV and the state radio [78] [79]\n\n\nBattle of Khartoum\nOn 15 April 2023, the RSF attacked SAF bases across Sudan, including Khartoum and its airport [70] [75] There were clashes at the headquarters of the state broadcaster, Sudan TV, which was later captured by RSF forces [76] Bridges and roads in Khartoum and its hinterland were closed by RSF command [77] The next day saw a SAF counteroffensive, with the army retaking Merowe Airport alongside the headquarters of Sudan TV and the state radio [78] [79]\n\n\nTreaty of Jeddah\nInternational attention to the conflict resulted in the United Nations Human Rights Council calling a special session to address the violence, voting to increase monitoring of human rights abuses [100] On 6 May, delegates from the SAF and the RSF met directly for the first time in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for what was described by Saudi Arabia and the United States as \"pre-negotiation talks\" [101] After diplomatic lobbying from the Saudis and Americans the warring sides signed the Treaty of Jeddah on 20 May, vowing to ensure the safe passage of civilians, protect relief workers, and prohibit the use of civilians as human shields [102] The agreement did not include a ceasefire, and clashes resumed in Geneina, causing more casualties [102] The United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths expressed frustration at the lack of commitment from both sides to end the fighting [103]\n\n\nJune–September 2023\nAs June began, Khartoum witnessed tank battles resulting in casualties [110] [111] The RSF took control of several important cultural and government buildings, including the National Museum of Sudan and the Yarmouk Military Industrial Complex [112] [113] Acute food insecurity affected a significant portion of Sudan's population [114]\n\n\nContinued fighting in Khartoum\nAs June began, Khartoum witnessed tank battles resulting in casualties [110] [111] The RSF took control of several important cultural and government buildings, including the National Museum of Sudan and the Yarmouk Military Industrial Complex [112] [113] Acute food insecurity affected a significant portion of Sudan's population [114]\n\n\nDiplomatic efforts\nCeasefires between the warring parties were announced but often violated, leading to further clashes The SAF and RSF engaged in mutual blame for incidents, while the Sudanese government took action against international envoys [127] The Saudi embassy in Khartoum was attacked and evacuations from an orphanage were carried out amid the chaos [128] Amidst the turmoil, Sudan faced diplomatic strains with Egypt, leading to challenges for Sudanese refugees seeking entry [129] [130]\n\n\nSPLM-N (Al-Hilu) involvement\nThe Abdelaziz al-Hilu faction of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement–North (SPLM-N) broke a long-standing ceasefire agreement in June, attacking SAF units in Kadugli, Kurmuk and Dalang, the latter coinciding with an attack by the RSF The SAF claimed to have repelled the attacks, [27] [6] while the rebels claimed to have attacked in retaliation for the death of one of their soldiers at the hands of the SAF and vowed to free the region from \"military occupation\" [63] More than 35,000 were displaced by the fighting [63] Speculation arose as to whether the attacks were part of an unofficial alliance between al-Hilu and the RSF or an attempt by al-Hilu to strengthen his position in future negotiations concerning his group [135] Civil society organizations supporting the SPLM-N claimed its operations sought to protect civilians from possible attacks by the RSF [136]\n\n\nDarfur front\nIn Darfur, fighting and bloodshed were particularly fierce around the city of Geneina, where hundreds died and extensive destruction occurred [140] RSF forces engaged in frequent acts of violence against the Masalit population of Geneina, leading to accusations of ethnic cleansing [141] On 4 August the RSF claimed that it had taken full control over all of Central Darfur [142]\n\n\nOctober–December 2023\nBy October 2023, the SAF in Darfur was experiencing acute shortages in supplies due to RSF-imposed sieges and had failed to utilize its air superiority to stem RSF advances [153] On 26 October, the RSF captured Nyala, Sudan's fourth-largest city, after seizing control of the SAF's 16th Infantry Division headquarters [154] The fall of Nyala, a strategic city with an international airport and border connections to Central Africa, allowed the RSF to receive international supplies more easily and concentrate its forces on other Sudanese cities [155] After Nyala's fall, RSF fighters turned their focus to Zalingei, the capital of Central Darfur The SAF's 21st Infantry Division, stationed in Zalingei, fled the city without a fight and allowed the RSF to take it over [156]\n\n\nSAF collapse in Darfur\nBy October 2023, the SAF in Darfur was experiencing acute shortages in supplies due to RSF-imposed sieges and had failed to utilize its air superiority to stem RSF advances [153] On 26 October, the RSF captured Nyala, Sudan's fourth-largest city, after seizing control of the SAF's 16th Infantry Division headquarters [154] The fall of Nyala, a strategic city with an international airport and border connections to Central Africa, allowed the RSF to receive international supplies more easily and concentrate its forces on other Sudanese cities [155] After Nyala's fall, RSF fighters turned their focus to Zalingei, the capital of Central Darfur The SAF's 21st Infantry Division, stationed in Zalingei, fled the city without a fight and allowed the RSF to take it over [156]\n\n\nPeace negotiations stall\nAttempts by other nations and international organisations to negotiate peace had largely been dormant since the failure of the Treaty of Jeddah, but in late October the RSF and SAF met once more in Jeddah to attempt to negotiate peace [166] This new round of talks was a failure, with neither side willing to commit to a ceasefire Instead, the warring factions agreed to open channels for humanitarian aid [167] On 3 December negotiations were indefinitely suspended due to the failure of both the SAF and the RSF to open up aid channels [168]\n\n\nRSF Crossing of the Nile\nThe RSF attacked the town of Wad Ashana in North Kordofan on 1 October along a key commercial route [171] [172] In West Kordofan, an uptick in fighting was reported, with the RSF assaulting a \"vital\" oil field in Baleela, south of Al-Fulah [173] Geolocated footage showed RSF fighters celebrating around Baleela Airport after allegedly capturing it [174] The Battle of Khartoum continued with the RSF seizing the town of al-Aylafoun, southeast of the capital, on 6 October In the process, the paramilitary gained control of key oil infrastructure [175] [176] By late October the RSF controlled most of Khartoum but had failed to seize key military bases, while al-Burhan's government had largely relocated to Port Sudan [177]\n\n\nJanuary–April 2024\nFollowing the fall of Wad Madani efforts by IGAD to negotiate a ceasefire made progress, as the SAF's weakened position made them more eager to enter talks Whereas previously opposition from Islamist political groups to negotiation had prevented al-Burhan from committing to a specific date, now both he and Hemedti agreed to meet on 28 December [186] [191] A day before the meeting was due, it was cancelled as Hemedti recanted his desire to attend [192]\n\n\nHemedti travels abroad\nFollowing the fall of Wad Madani efforts by IGAD to negotiate a ceasefire made progress, as the SAF's weakened position made them more eager to enter talks Whereas previously opposition from Islamist political groups to negotiation had prevented al-Burhan from committing to a specific date, now both he and Hemedti agreed to meet on 28 December [186] [191] A day before the meeting was due, it was cancelled as Hemedti recanted his desire to attend [192]\n\n\nFighting in Kordofan and Gezira\nAs 2024 began the RSF made attacks into South Kordofan, defeating SAF forces in the town of Habila in the Nuba Mountains and pushing toward Dalang [197] On 7 January the RSF attacked SAF positions in Dalang, meeting fierce resistance from the army and civilian militias [190] [198] During the fighting the SPLM-N (al-Hilu) entered the city, taking control of several neighbourhoods SPLM-N forces proceeded to attack the RSF, and the paramilitary retreated from the city [199] RSF fighters withdrawing from Dalang entered the city of Muglad in West Kordofan, easily taking control as the city had no organised SAF presence West Kordofan had been relatively free of fighting for several months due to a local truce brokered by leaders of the Messiria tribe, but as tensions escalated rumours spread that the RSF was planning an attack on the encircled city of Babanusa and the SAF 22nd Infantry Division garrisoning it [199]\n\n\nSAF gains in Omdurman\nThe SAF gained ground in Omdurman in February 2024, linking up their forces in the northern part of the city and relieving a 10-month siege of their forces in the city centre The SAF also took control of the Al-Hilal Stadium [206] As of February 2024, the Omdurman front is the only area in Sudan where the SAF has carried out a sustained offensive operation and represents the first breakthrough for the SAF [206]\n\n\nApril 2024–present\nOn 15 April, during the Battle of El Fasher, at least nine civilians were killed in a renewed offensive by the RSF on the city of Al-Fashir in North Darfur [210] The Joint Darfur Force declared war on the RSF and allied with the SAF [211] [212]\n\n\nFighting in Darfur\nOn 15 April, during the Battle of El Fasher, at least nine civilians were killed in a renewed offensive by the RSF on the city of Al-Fashir in North Darfur [210] The Joint Darfur Force declared war on the RSF and allied with the SAF [211] [212]\n\n\nFighting in Kordofan\nAs of May 2024, fighting is ongoing in Babanusa, West Kordofan The RSF is conducting an offensive to attempt to take control of West Kordofan [219] Fighting was also reported in North Kordofan [220]\n\n\nFighting along the Nile\nIn May 2024, the RSF launched attacks against the SAF between Khartoum State and River Nile State, as well as in White Nile State near the border with Gezira State The SAF prepared its forces in River Nile State, ahead of a potential invasion of Khartoum Bahri [222] In June 2024, the RSF was still in control of Khartoum and Khartoum North, though the SAF controlled one enclave in each that it supplies by airdrop [223]\n\n\nSAF offensives\nAs September 2024 came, for the first time since the start of the war the balance of power seemed to be tipping towards the SAF On 26 September, the SAF launched a major offensive against RSF positions in Khartoum [232] The attack on the city came from three fronts striking from the south, east and west of the capital [233] SAF airstrikes, which killed four and wounded 14, began at dawn followed by clashes within the city The SAF reportedly captured three key bridges connecting Khartoum to other nearby cities, including the Omdurman Bridge which had previously acted as a line of separation between government and RSF control [234] [235] Faced with an elusive enemy, the SAF became bogged down in urban fighting - with RSF snipers routinely paralyzing infantry advances [233]\n\n\nCasualties\nAccording to a report published by Le Monde in November 2024, the war may have killed over 150,000 civilians through the combined tolls of bombardments, massacres, starvation and disease [233] A November 2024 report from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine estimated more than 61,000 deaths in Khartoum State alone, for the period between April 2023 and June 2024 [239]\n\n\nDarfur\nIn Geneina, West Darfur, ethnic clashes that began in the last week of April 2023 had killed at least 1,100 people, [245] while the Sultanate of Dar Masalit claimed that more than 5,000 people were killed and about 8,000 were wounded in the city [241] In July 2023, a Masalit tribal leader claimed that more than 10,000 people had been killed in West Darfur alone, and that 80% of Geneina's residents had fled [242]\n\n\nEastern Sudan\nIn July 2023, authorities reported at least 88 cases of sexual assault on women across the country, most of them blamed on the RSF [249] NGOs estimated that the figure could possibly reach 4,400 [250] Activist Hala al-Karib stated that war rape had become an everyday occurrence with both fighting parties participating [251] In 2024, Al Jazeera reported that Sudanese women were forced to exchange sex for food or become mistresses to RSF fighters to ensure their families’ safety and access to food [252]\n\n\nSexual violence\nIn July 2023, authorities reported at least 88 cases of sexual assault on women across the country, most of them blamed on the RSF [249] NGOs estimated that the figure could possibly reach 4,400 [250] Activist Hala al-Karib stated that war rape had become an everyday occurrence with both fighting parties participating [251] In 2024, Al Jazeera reported that Sudanese women were forced to exchange sex for food or become mistresses to RSF fighters to ensure their families’ safety and access to food [252]\n\n\nCasualties among humanitarian workers\nIn the Battle of Kabkabiya, three employees of the World Food Programme (WFP) were killed after being caught in the crossfire at a military base Two other staff members were injured [256] On 18 April 2023, the EU's top humanitarian aid officer in Sudan, Wim Fransen of Belgium, was shot and injured in Khartoum [257] On 21 April 2023, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported that one of its local employees was killed in a crossfire while traveling with his family near El-Obeid [258] On 20 July 2023, an 18-member team of Médecins Sans Frontières was attacked while transporting supplies to the Turkish Hospital in south Khartoum By then, the World Health Organization had verified 51 attacks on medical facilities and personnel since the conflict began, resulting in 10 deaths and 24 injuries [259] On 25 July 2023, Humanitarian Coordinator Clementine Nkweta-Salami said 18 aid workers had been killed and over two dozen others were detained or unaccounted for [260] The conflict has led the United Nations to declare Sudan the most dangerous country in the world for humanitarian workers after South Sudan [261]\n\n\nAttacks on journalists\nThe SAF and RSF are accused of threatening, attacking, and killing journalists during the conflict The Sudanese Journalists Syndicate documented over 40 violations in May alone Several journalists were injured or killed, and 13 newspapers ceased operations Humanitarian workers were also targeted, with 18 killed and many others detained.\n\n\nForeign casualties\nCivilians, including 15 Syrians, [281] 15 Ethiopians [280] and 9 Eritreans [283] have been killed across the country An Indian national working in Khartoum died after being hit by a stray bullet on 15 April [286] Two Americans were killed, including a professor working in the University of Khartoum who was stabbed to death while evacuating [285] [288] A two-year-old girl from Turkey was killed while her parents were injured after their house was struck by a rocket on 18 April [287] Two Egyptian doctors were killed in their home in Khartoum and had their possessions stolen on 13 June [284] Ten students from the Democratic Republic of the Congo were killed in an SAF airstrike on the International University of Africa in Khartoum on 4 June [282] The SAF claimed that the Egyptian assistant military attaché was killed by RSF fire while driving his car in Khartoum, which was refuted by the Egyptian ambassador [289]\n\n\nNotable deaths\nOn 16 April 2023, the RSF claimed that its troops in Port Sudan were attacked by foreign aircraft and issued a warning against any foreign interference [304] According to former CIA analyst Cameron Hudson, Egyptian fighter jets were a part of these bombing campaigns against the RSF, and Egyptian special forces units have been deployed and are providing intelligence and tactical support to the SAF [305] The Wall Street Journal said that Egypt had sent fighter jets and pilots to support the Sudanese military [306] On 17 April, satellite imagery obtained by The War Zone revealed that one Egyptian Air Force MiG-29M2 fighter jet had been destroyed and two others had been damaged or destroyed at Merowe Airbase A Sudanese Air Force Guizhou JL-9 was among the destroyed aircraft [307] After initial confusion, the RSF accepted the explanation that Egyptian combat and support personnel were conducting exercises with the Sudanese military before the outbreak of hostilities [70]\n\n\nForeign involvement\nOn 16 April 2023, the RSF claimed that its troops in Port Sudan were attacked by foreign aircraft and issued a warning against any foreign interference [304] According to former CIA analyst Cameron Hudson, Egyptian fighter jets were a part of these bombing campaigns against the RSF, and Egyptian

personnel were conducting exercises with the Sudanese military before the outbreak of hostilities [70]\n\n\nEgypt\nOn 16 April 2023, the RSF claimed that its troops in Port Sudan were attacked by

support personnel were conducting exercises with the Sudanese military before the outbreak of hostilities [70]\n\n\nEgyptian POWs\nOn 15 April, RSF forces claimed, via Twitter, to have taken Egyptian troops prisoner near Merowe, [308] [309] and a military plane carrying markings of the Egyptian Air Force [310] Initially, no official explanation was given for the Egyptian soldiers' presence, while Egypt and Sudan have had military cooperation due to diplomatic tensions with Ethiopia [311] Later on, the Egyptian Armed Forces stated that around 200 of its soldiers were in Sudan to conduct exercises with the Sudanese military [70] Around that time, the SAF reportedly encircled RSF forces in Merowe airbase As a result, the Egyptian Armed Forces announced that it was following the situation as a precaution for the safety of its personnel [77] [312] [better source needed] The RSF later stated that it would cooperate in repatriating the soldiers to Egypt [310] On 19 April, the RSF stated that it had moved the soldiers to Khartoum and would hand them over when the \"appropriate opportunity\" arose [313] One hundred and seventy-seven of the captured Egyptian troops were released and flown back to Egypt aboard three Egyptian military planes that took off from Khartoum airport later in the day The remaining 27 soldiers, who were from the Egyptian Air Force, were sheltered at the Egyptian embassy and later evacuated [314] [315]\n\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\nA report published by the Wall Street Journal on 10 August 2023 quoted Ugandan officials as saying that an Emirati plane on a stopover at Entebbe Airport en route to Amdjarass International Airport in eastern Chad turned out upon inspection to have been carrying dozens of green plastic crates in the plane's cargo hold filled with ammunition, assault rifles and other small arms\", rather than food and other aid officially listed on the aircraft's manifest supposedly meant for Sudanese refugees Despite the discovery, the plane was allowed to take off, and the officials said they received orders from their superiors not to inspect any more planes from the UAE Before this, the UAE had long been accused of supporting the RSF The UAE Foreign Ministry subsequently denied the allegations, saying that the country \"does not take sides\" in the conflict [316]\n\n\nRussia\nFor much of the Sudanese civil war Russia has taken a generally neutral stance, not clearly backing either the RSF or SAF [345] This neutral attitude began to shift during mid-2024, with the Russian government beginning to favour the SAF, concurrent with the SAF emphasising its support for the construction of a Russian naval base north of Port Sudan [345] This move by the SAF was calculated to exploit tensions between Russia and western powers following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, offering the Russian government an opportunity to expand its international military influence in exchange for an international ally willing to both oppose the United Arab Emirates and provide significant weaponry [345] The SAF had at this stage of the conflict suffered several successive defeats at the hands of the RSF, making them more eager to make concessions to win international support [346]\n\n\nWagner Group\nAccording to CNN, Wagner supplied surface-to-air missiles to the RSF, picking up the items from Syria and delivering some of them by plane to Haftar-controlled bases in Libya to be then delivered to the RSF, while dropping other items directly to RSF positions in northwestern Sudan [347] American officials said that Wagner was offering to supply additional weapons to the RSF from its existing stocks in the Central African Republic [348] On 6 September, Wagner reportedly deployed a convoy of more than 100 vehicles carrying weapons to the RSF garrison in al-Zurug from Chad [349] SAF Lieutenant General Yasser al-Atta also accused the Wagner Group of bringing in mercenaries from several African nations to fight alongside the RSF [318]\n\n\nIran\nIn June 2024, a BBC investigation found evidence of the involvement of Iran and the UAE in violating the UN arms embargo by providing drones in the Sudanese conflict In March 2024, a piece of video evidence showed that Sudanese soldiers recaptured the state broadcaster's headquarters in Khartoum with the assistance of Iranian-made drones A drone expert, Wim Zwijnenburg also observed that an army drone shot down by the RSF in January 2024 resembled the Iranian-made Mohajer-6 drone Evidence also revealed the use of quadcopter drones by the RSF, which Brian Castner claimed belonged to the UAE The drones are capable of dropping 120mm motor shells, are had been supplied by the Emirates to its allies in the Yemen and Ethiopian wars [330]\n\n\nOther foreign actors\nOn 7 June 2023, Hissein Alamine Tchaw-tchaw, a Chadian dissident who belongs to the same ethnic group as Hemedti and claims to be the leader of the Movement for the Fight of the Oppressed in Chad (MFOC), which is fighting the government of President Mahamat Déby, posted a video showing his participation in an RSF attack on the Yarmouk munitions factory in Khartoum [360]\n\n\nChad\nOn 7 June 2023, Hissein Alamine Tchaw-tchaw, a Chadian dissident who belongs to the same ethnic group as Hemedti and claims to be the leader of the Movement for the Fight of the Oppressed in Chad (MFOC), which is fighting the government of President Mahamat Déby, posted a video showing his participation in an RSF attack on the Yarmouk munitions factory in Khartoum [360]\n\n\nKenya\nThe SAF rejected Kenya's involvement in mediation efforts to end the conflict in July after al-Burhan accused President William Ruto of having a business relationship with Hemedti and providing a haven to the RSF [366] [367] In response to proposals for a peacekeeping force composed by African countries to be deployed in Sudan made in an Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) committee chaired by Ruto, the SAF's Assistant Commander-in-Chief Lieutenant General Yasir Alatta accused Ruto of being a mercenary of another country, whom he did not identify, and dared Ruto to deploy the Kenyan army and that of his alleged backer [368] On 7 September, the Sudanese government threatened to withdraw the country's membership in IGAD unless Ruto was removed as chairman of the mediation committee [369]\n\n\nLibyan National Army\nThe Egypt-backed Libyan National Army, under the command of Khalifa Haftar, dispatched aircraft to fly military supplies to the RSF

September [349] Kyrylo Budanov, the chief of the Ukrainian Main Directorate of Intelligence, stated in an interview on 22 September that he could neither confirm or deny Ukraine's involvement in the conflict, [375] but said that Ukraine \"will be seeking and hunting down Russian military criminals .. sooner or later\" [376]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nIn June 2024, The Guardian reported that according to multiple sources, UK government officials \"attempted to suppress criticism\" of the United Arab Emirates and its alleged role in supplying arms to the RSF [380] Furthermore, the UK is the UN Security Council's \"penholder\" [381] for Sudan [380] In early 2023, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office initiated secret talks between the RSF and the UK [382]\n\n\nEvacuation of foreign nationals\nThe outbreak of violence has led foreign governments to monitor the situation in Sudan and move toward the evacuation and repatriation of their nationals Among some countries with several expatriates in Sudan are Egypt, which has more than 10,000 citizens in the country, [383] and the United States, which has more than 16,000 citizens, most of whom are dual nationals [384] Efforts at extraction were hampered by the fighting within the capital Khartoum, particularly in and around the airport This has forced evacuations to be undertaken by road via Port Sudan on the Red Sea, which lies about 650 km (400 miles) northeast of Khartoum [385] from where they were airlifted or ferried directly to their home countries or third ones Other evacuations were undertaken through overland border crossings or airlifts from diplomatic missions and other designated locations with direct involvement of the militaries of some home countries Some transit hubs used during the evacuation include the port of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia and Djibouti, which hosts military bases of the United States, China, Japan, France, and other European countries [386]\n\n\nSanctions\nThe repeated violations of the ceasefire agreements and other atrocities during the conflict led to U.S President Joe Biden issuing an executive order on 4 May 2023 authorizing sanctions for those deemed responsible for destabilizing Sudan, undermining the democratic transition and committing human rights abuses [387] On 1 June, the US government imposed its first sanctions related to the conflict,

manufacturing and procuring weapons for the SAF and the RSF [396]\n\n\nHumanitarian impact\nThe humanitarian crisis following the fighting was further exacerbated by the violence occurring during a period of high temperatures, and drought starting during the fasting month of Ramadan Civilians were unable to venture outside of their homes to obtain food and supplies for fear of getting caught in the crossfire A doctors' group said that hospitals remained understaffed and were running low on supplies as wounded people streamed in [397] The World Health Organization (WHO) recorded around 26 attacks on healthcare facilities, some of which resulted in casualties among medical workers and civilians [398] The WHO said 80% of hospitals in conflict areas were out of service [399] with 32 forcibly evacuated by soldiers or caught in the crossfire [400] This included about half of Khartoum's 130 medical facilities and all hospitals in West Darfur [401] Outbreaks of diseases such as measles, cholera and diarrhea were reported across the country [402] In August 2024 cholera was declared an epidemic in the country and as of 8 September 2024 [update], there were 5,692 cases of cholera including 185 deaths [403]\n\n\nRefugees\nAs of July 2024, nearly 10 million residents of Sudan have been displaced due to the fighting The United Nations said that the conflict had produced more than 7.7 million internally displaced persons (IDPs), while more than 2.1 million had fled the country altogether as of June 2024 [21] [20] This made Sudan the largest host of IDPs globally [414] The International Organization for Migration estimated that around 36% of IDPs came from the Khartoum region [21] In November, the UN said the conflict created the largest child displacement crisis in the world, affecting three million children [415]\n\n\nEconomic impact\nThe UN estimated that economic activity in Sudan fell by more than a third during the first three weeks of the conflict [420] In July, Sudanese economists estimated the total amount of damage brought by the conflict at $9 billion, or an average of $100 million per day, while the value of property and goods looted was estimated at another $40 billion, with the most affected areas being Khartoum and South Darfur [421] The exchange rate of the US dollar against the Sudanese pound in the black market rose to SDG730 in September, while it reached SDG625 at the official rate This later reached SDG1250 in February 2024 The formal economy was described as being in a \"near standstill\" [422] [420] Gold production was also reduced to just 2 tons from the previous year's output of 18 tons [423] Sudanese minister for minerals Mohamed Bashir Abu Nammu accused the RSF of looting around 15 tons of silver and 1,273 kilograms of gold from the Sudan Gold Refinery at the start of the conflict [424]\n\n\nWar crimes investigations\nBoth the SAF and the RSF are accused of committing war crimes [427] The RSF in particular have been denounced by Human Rights Watch and numerous governments for committing crimes against humanity [428]\n\n\nDisinformation\nDuring the conflict, many instances of disinformation were observed, which aimed to manipulate public opinion, spread false narratives, and create confusion Both the SAF and the RSF engaged in disinformation campaigns on social media platforms [440] The RSF heavily relied on tweets and inauthentic behaviour to spread its agenda and influence local and international opinions The SAF used Twitter to refute RSF claims and boost army morale with false victory claims [440] The RSF had dedicated teams based in Khartoum and Dubai to engage in a digital propaganda war They used social media, including officially verified Facebook and Twitter accounts, to showcase their activities and spread disinformation [441]\n\n\nExamples\nOn 14 April, the official SAF social media page published a video which it said was of operations carried out by the Sudanese Air Force against the RSF Al Jazeera's monitoring and verification unit claimed the video had been fabricated using footage from the video game Arma 3 that was published on TikTok in March 2023 The unit claimed the video showing Sudanese army commander Abdel Fattah al-Burhan inspecting the Armoured Corps, in Al-Shajara, was from before the fighting A video reportedly of helicopters flying over Khartoum to participate in operations by the SAF against the RSF, which circulated on social media, turned out to be from November 2022 [444]\n\n\nResponses\nOn 11 August, Facebook shut down the main pages of the RSF due to a violation of its policy, \"Dangerous Organizations and Individuals\" In an alternate account, the RSF accused the SAF of lodging complaints based on false reports that led to the removal of its pages and said it was in contact with Facebook's parent company Meta Platforms to restore them [454]\n\n\nIn popular culture\n\n\nSee

small wooden church in their names (its construction began at the same time as the citadel) made them the heavenly patrons of the Peter and Paul Fortress, while Saint Peter at the same time became the eponym of the whole city When in June 1703 Peter the Great renamed the site after Saint Peter, he did not issue a naming act that established an official spelling; even in his own letters he used diverse spellings, such as Санктьпетерсьбурк (Sanktpetersburk), emulating German Sankt Petersburg, and Сантпитербурх (Santpiterburkh), emulating Dutch Sint-Pietersburgh, as Peter was multilingual and a Hollandophile The name was later normalized and russified to Санкт-Петербург [17] [18] [19]\n\n\nHistory\nSwedish colonists built Nyenskans, a fortress at the mouth of the Neva River in 1611, which was later called Ingermanland The small town of Nyen grew up around the fort Before the 17th century, this area was inhabited by Finnic Izhorians and Votians The Ingrian Finns moved to the region from the provinces of Karelia and Savonia during the Swedish rule There was also some Estonian, Karelian, Russian and German population in the area [34] [35]\n\n\nImperial era (1703–1917)\nSwedish

inhabited by Finnic Izhorians and Votians The Ingrian Finns moved to the region from the provinces of Karelia and Savonia during the Swedish rule There was also some Estonian, Karelian, Russian and German population in the area [34] [35]\n\n\nRevolution and Soviet era (1917–1941)\nIn March 1917, during the February Revolution Nicholas II abdicated for himself and on behalf of his son, ending the Russian monarchy and over three hundred years of Romanov dynastic rule.\n\n\nWorld War II (1941–1945)\nDuring World War II, German forces besieged Leningrad following the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 [53] The siege lasted 872 days, or almost two and a half years, [53] from 8 September 1941 to 27 January 1944 [54]\n\n\nPost-war Soviet era (1945–1991)\nIn October 1946 some territories along the northern coast of the Gulf of Finland, which had been annexed into the USSR from Finland in 1940 under the peace treaty following the Winter War, were transferred from Leningrad Oblast to Leningrad and divided into Sestroretsky District and Kurortny District These included the town of Terijoki (renamed Zelenogorsk in 1948) [47] Leningrad and many of its suburbs were rebuilt over the post-war decades, partially according to pre-war plans The 1948 general plan for Leningrad featured radial urban development in the north as well as in the south In 1953, Pavlovsky District in Leningrad Oblast was abolished, and parts of its territory, including Pavlovsk, merged with Leningrad In 1954, the settlements Levashovo, Pargolovo and Pesochny merged with Leningrad

settlements.\n\n\nClimate\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, Saint Petersburg is classified as Dfb, a humid continental climate The distinct moderating influence of Baltic Sea cyclones results in mild to hot, humid, and short summers and long, moderately cold wet winters The climate of Saint Petersburg is close to that of Helsinki, although slightly more continental (i.e colder in winter and warmer in summer) because of its more eastern location, while slightly less continental than that of Moscow.\n\n\nDemographics\nSaint Petersburg is the second largest city in Russia As of the 2021

the city is featured in Pushkin's last poems, the Petersburg stories of Gogol, the novels of Dostoyevsky, the verse of Alexander Blok and Osip Mandelshtam, and in the symbolist novel Petersburg by Andrey Bely According to Lotman in his chapter, 'The Symbolism of Saint Petersburg' in Universe and the Mind, these writers were inspired by symbolism from within the city itself The effect of life in Saint Petersburg on the plight of the poor clerk in a society obsessed with hierarchy and status also became an important theme for authors such as Pushkin, Gogol, and Dostoyevsky Another important

home to several riverine services that convey passengers around the city efficiently and in relative comfort.\n\n\nPublic transport\nSaint Petersburg has an extensive city-funded network of public transport (buses, trams, trolleybuses  [ru]) and several hundred routes served by marshrutkas In 2022 marshrutkas have been mostly phased out in favor of publicly owned buses [136] Trams in Saint Petersburg used to be the main means of transport; in the 1980s this was the largest tram network globally, but many tracks were dismantled in the 2000s [citation needed]\n\n\nRoads\nTraffic jams are common in the city due to daily commuter traffic volumes, intercity traffic and excessive winter snow The construction of freeways such as the Saint Petersburg Ring Road, completed in 2011, and the Western High-Speed Diameter, completed in 2017, helped reduce the traffic in the city The M11 Neva, also known as the Moscow-Saint Petersburg Motorway, is a federal highway, and connects Saint Petersburg to Moscow by a freeway.\n\n\nWaterways\nThe city is also served by passenger and cargo seaports [clarification needed] in the Neva Bay of the Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea, the river port higher up the Neva and tens of smaller passenger stations on both banks of the Neva river It is a terminus of both the Volga–Baltic and White Sea–Baltic waterways  [citation needed]\n\n\nRail\nThe city is the final destination for a web of intercity and suburban railways, served by five different railway terminals (Baltiysky, Finlyandsky, Ladozhsky, Moskovsky and Vitebsky), [g] [141] as well as dozens of non-terminal railway stations within the federal subject Saint Petersburg has international railway connections to Helsinki, Finland, Berlin, Germany, and many former republics of the USSR The Helsinki railway, built in 1870 and 443 kilometres (275 mi) long, had until 2022 trains running five times a day, in a journey lasting about three and a half hours with the Allegro train.\n\n\nAir\nSaint Petersburg is served by Pulkovo International Airport [145]\n\n\nNotable people\nList of sister cities to Saint Petersburg as it appears on the official portal of the City Government, listing both sister cities and partnership ties: [148]\n\n\nInternational relations\nList of sister cities to Saint Petersburg as it appears on the official portal of the City Government, listing both sister cities and partnership ties: [148]\n\n\nFormer twin towns\nItalian cities Milan and Venice were formerly twin cities of Saint Petersburg, but suspended this link due to St. Petersburg's ban on \"gay propaganda\" [192] Milan suspended the relationship with Saint Petersburg on 23 November 2012 [193] and Venice did so on 28 January 2013 [194]\n\n\nTwinning with occupied Mariupol\nSome Russian cities are twinned with ones in occupied Ukraine, in particular, Saint Petersburg is twinned with Mariupol [206] An art symbol of the twinning was unveiled on Palace Square in

He's coming off a draw to Tim Bradley, was ahead on the cards against Brandon Rios until he was disqualified and gave Keith Thurman a solid fight, so we know what level he has mixed at and how good he is.\"\n\n**Jessie Vargas Negotiations**\n\nIt was announced on 12 May 2016 that negotiations for a unification fight with WBO titleholder Jessie Vargas were under way. Eddie Hearn told Sky Sports he had \"offered a huge amount of money\" to make the fight happen and while he conceded Brook might have to travel to America, Vargas insisted he was willing to cross the Atlantic. Danny García, the WBC champion, was top of the list, but Hearn conceded the Vargas fight looked more likely. Hearn said the fight will take place on 20 August, 27 August, or 3 September at Bramall Lane in Sheffield. Vargas confirmed via his Twitter account that the bout was set for 3 September. Negotiations fell through on 9 July for the unification title fight, when it was announced that Brook would be moving up two weight divisions to challenge Gennady Golovkin instead.\n\n**Middleweight**\n\nOn 8 July 2016, it was announced that Brook would face undefeated, unified WBA (Super), WBC, IBF, and IBO middleweight champion Gennady Golovkin.

The fight aired in the US on HBO and on Sky Box Office pay-per-view in the UK.\n\n**Return to Welterweight**\n\nOn 14 November 2020, Brook moved back down to the welterweight division and attempted to become a two-time welterweight champion when he faced undefeated Terence Crawford in Paradise, Nevada for his WBO world title. In the fourth round, Crawford caught Brook with a stiff, hard right jab, and the referee administered a standing count to the latter. The fight continued, but Crawford quickly landed a flurry of shots which prompted the referee to step in and halt the contest, making Crawford the winner by fourth-round technical knockout.\n\n**Brook vs. Spence Jr.**\n\nIn January 2017, Brook and his team were in talks with Amir Khan over a potential grudge fight, while also keeping the mandatory fight with Errol Spence Jr as second choice. During negotiations, Khan urged Brook to fight Spence first and eventually talks broke down between Brook and Khan. Eddie Hearn mentioned talks were already ongoing with Spence's manager Al Haymon for a fight to take place possibly in the UK in May. Hearn received an extension from the IBF for negotiations between himself and TGB Promotions boss Tom Brown, as they were progressing. The purse bids for the fight were set for 7 February by the IBF. On 1 February, Hearn claimed that Brook would be keeping his title and making a defence against Spence and that he had reached out to Spence's team, to no reply. He assumed that they wanted the fight to go to purse bids. Spence said that he had no problem travelling to the UK for the fight, regardless of negotiations. With a deal close to being reached a day before the purse bids, the IBF granted a week extension, pushing the purse bid back 7 days. On 13 February, a deal was reached for the fight to take place in Sheffield on 20 May 2017.\n\n**Light-Middleweight**\n\nOn 30 May 2017, Brook admitted he may have to move up to light-middleweight. Brook had successful surgery on his eye in June 2017 and said that he would start training again in the summer looking to make a ring return in late 2017. On 21 November, promoter Eddie Hearn announced that Brook would be moving up to light-middleweight in hopes of becoming a two-weight world champion. In an interview, Brook stated that he would return at light-middleweight for the sake of his health, however, could still return to welterweight afterwards.\n\n**Brook vs. Rabchenko**\n\nEddie Hearn, on 11 December 2017, announced that Brook would return to Sheffield at the FlyDSA Arena on 3 March 2018 against former European champion Sergey Rabchenko (29–2, 22 KOs) on Sky Sports. Rabchenko is known for fighting in the UK on some occasions, most notably defeating Brook's fellow gym buddy Ryan Rhodes in 2012. The WBC Silver light-middleweight title would be at stake for the fight. Brook weighed 153.4 pounds while Rabchenko weighed 153.7 pounds. Brook stopped Rabchenko in round two to claim the vacant WBC Silver title. In round one, Brook used his jab and right hand, with Rabchenko on the back foot leaving himself open. In round two, Brook hurt Rabchenko with a right uppercut. The shot wobbled Rabchenko, causing him to back up on unsteady legs. Brook then hit Rabchenko with a straight right hand to the head which put him down. Rabchenko slowly got to his feet at the count of nine, however, clearly hurt, referee Steve Gray halted the fight at 1 minute 27 seconds of round two.\n\n**Brook vs. Zerafa**\n\nIn early October 2018, it was reported that Brook and Khan had made some progress in their ongoing negotiations. With Brook stating that 147 pounds would not be an issue, Khan demanded they include a 10-pound rehydration limit, which meant neither boxer could weigh over 157 pounds on the morning of the fight. Brook rejected the idea and insisted they fight at catchweight. On 19 October, according to The Sheffield Star, Brook had split with longtime trainer Dominic Ingle. The same reports stated Brook would train with longtime friend John Fewkes. Ingle denied rumours that he and Brook had a falling out. Fewkes stated it was the first he had heard of the news. On 27 October, Brook told Sky Sports that he would be returning to the ring at the FlyDSA Arena in Sheffield on 8 December 2018. Although an opponent was not named, it was speculated it would be Michael Zerafa, as Zerafa later spoke out confirming he would cause on upset and then challenge Khan himself. Brook was ranked #2 by the WBA and WBC, #4 by the WBO and #5 by the IBF while Zerafa was ranked #8 by the WBA at super welterweight. On 29 October, Brook denied he had split with Ingle, however, confirmed that because Ingle was in Canada training other fighters, he would keep his camp in Fuerteventura, therefore Ingle would not be in his corner for the fight. On 5 November, Zerafa (25–2, 14 KOs) was confirmed as Brook's opponent. Showing that he could easily make the 147 limit, Brook weighed in 150 pounds, compared to Zerafa, who weighed 153 pounds. It was said the bout would be a final eliminator for Jarrett Hurd's WBA title.\n\n**Brook vs. DeLuca**\n\nAfter a layoff of 14 months, Brook returned to the ring on 8 February 2020 to face Mark DeLuca for the vacant WBO Inter-Continental light-middleweight title.

competes in the Formula One World Championship with McLaren. He was born on November 13, 1999, in Bristol, England, to a family of modest means. His father, Adam Norris, is a retired pensions manager, and his mother, Cisca Wauman, is from the Flanders region of Belgium.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nLando Norris was born in Bristol, England, and grew up in a family of three siblings. His older brother, Oliver, was also involved in karting on a competitive level until 2014. Norris holds both British and Belgian citizenship and speaks a small amount of Flemish Dutch. In his early childhood, Norris tried horse riding, then quad biking and motorcycle riding before moving into karting after his father took him to watch the national British Karting Championships at age seven.\n\nNorris was educated at Millfield School in Street, Somerset, where he left school without taking his GCSEs. However, he studied physics and mathematics with a full-time personal tutor. His family later moved to Glastonbury to allow him to become a day pupil and pursue his racing career, citing Valentino Rossi as an inspiration. At the start of his F1 career, Norris initially resided in Woking near the McLaren team headquarters but later moved to Monaco in 2022 for financial reasons.\n\nJunior Racing Career\n\nNorris started his racing career at the age of seven when he claimed pole position at his first national event. In 2013, Norris competed in the KF-Junior class, winning the CIK-FIA European Championship and the CIK-FIA International Super Cup, as well as the WSK Euro Series. The following year, he won the CIK-FIA World Championship in KF class with Ricky Flynn Motorsport, making him the youngest karting world champion in that category.\n\nKarting\n\nNorris started his racing career at the age of seven when he claimed pole position at his first national event.

The following year, he won the CIK-FIA World Championship in KF class with Ricky Flynn Motorsport, making him the youngest karting world champion in that category.\n\nGinetta Junior Championship\n\nIn 2014, Norris made his car racing debut in the Ginetta Junior Championship, a support series to the British Touring Car Championship. He finished third in the championship, winning four races and claiming the Rookie Cup.\n\nLower Formulae\n\nFor 2015, Norris signed with Carlin Motorsport to drive in the newly established MSA Formula Championship (now known as the F4 British Championship). Norris took eight wins, ten pole positions, and fourteen total podiums to win the championship ahead of Ricky Collard and Colton Herta. He also made occasional appearances in the ADAC and Italian Formula 4 championships with Mücke Motorsport, where he claimed six podiums from eight starts in the former.\n\nFormula 4\n\nFor 2015, Norris signed with Carlin Motorsport to drive in the newly established MSA Formula Championship (now known as the F4 British Championship). Norris took eight wins, ten pole positions, and fourteen total podiums to win the championship ahead of Ricky Collard and Colton Herta. He also made occasional appearances in the ADAC and Italian Formula 4 championships with Mücke Motorsport, where he claimed six podiums from eight starts in the former.\n\nFormula Three and Formula Renault\n\nIn January 2016, Norris traveled to New Zealand to compete in the Toyota Racing Series with the M2 Competition team. He achieved six race wins, including the New Zealand Grand Prix, and won the championship ahead of Jehan Daruvala. Norris then returned to Europe to race in the Formula Renault 2.0 category with Josef Kaufmann Racing, competing in both the Eurocup and Northern European Cup. He won both series, taking eleven race wins in total and recording ten consecutive pole positions in the latter. At the same time, Norris embarked on a part-time campaign in the BRDC British Formula 3 Championship and claimed four wins in eleven races. In October, he made a guest appearance in the final round of the European Formula 3 Championship at the Hockenheimring in preparation for the Macau Grand Prix in November. Norris placed ninth in qualifying in Macau but was eliminated from the qualification race after crashing on the first lap. In the main race, he progressed from 27th on the grid to finish 11th.\n\nFormula 2\n\nThe weekend following the Macau Grand Prix, Norris made his FIA Formula 2 debut with Campos Racing, replacing Ralph Boschung for the final round of the 2017 season at the Yas Marina Circuit.\n\nFormula One Career\n\nIn February 2017, Norris was signed as a junior driver with McLaren. Following the announcement, Zak Brown said that Norris was \"a fabulous prospect\" who deserved the award. Later that year, Norris tested for McLaren in a scheduled mid-season test. He set the second-fastest lap in the second day of testing at the Hungaroring. In late 2017, Norris became the official McLaren test and reserve driver for the 2018 season. Norris participated in his first official practice session at the Belgian Grand Prix, recording 26 laps. Norris drove in six further practice sessions during the year.\n\nMcLaren (2019–present)\n\nNorris was contracted to drive for McLaren for the 2019 Formula One World Championship, partnering Carlos Sainz Jr. He qualified eighth on his debut at the Australian Grand Prix and finished the race in twelfth place. He scored his first Formula One points by finishing sixth at the following race, the Bahrain Grand Prix. The Chinese Grand Prix was the first of Norris' retirements that season, after damage from a first-lap collision with Daniil Kvyat caused him to retire later in the race. Further retirements came at the Spanish Grand Prix after a collision with Lance Stroll and at the Canadian Grand Prix when a brake fire caused his suspension to fail.\n\n2020: Maiden Podium\n\nAt the season-opening Austrian Grand Prix, Norris qualified in fourth place but was elevated to third after a grid penalty for Lewis Hamilton, the highest grid position of his career at the time and the highest for McLaren since the 2016 Austrian Grand Prix. In the closing stages of the race, third-placed Hamilton was issued a five-second penalty for causing a collision with Alex Albon. Norris set the fastest lap of the race on the final lap to finish 4.802 seconds behind Hamilton, allowing Norris to claim the first podium finish of his career. This made Norris the third-youngest podium-finisher in Formula One history. At the Styrian Grand Prix, Norris qualified sixth but was given a three-place grid penalty for overtaking under yellow flags during practice. He passed three cars in the final two laps of the race to finish fifth, in what he described as \"one of the best races of [his] career.\"\n\n2021: Maiden Pole Position\n\nNorris remained at McLaren for the 2021 season, partnering Daniel Ricciardo as Sainz left the team for Ferrari. Norris qualified seventh for the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix and finished the race fourth. At the following race, the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, a qualifying time that would have placed him third on the grid was deleted for exceeding track limits, and he started the race seventh. Norris had run in second place before being passed by Lewis Hamilton with three laps remaining. He finished third to claim his second Formula One podium finish. At the Monaco Grand Prix, Norris started fifth and benefited from Charles Leclerc's failure to start the race and Valtteri Bottas' retirement to claim another podium finish. Norris was issued a grid penalty and started ninth at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix for failing to enter the pits during a red flag period in qualifying, a sanction he criticized as \"unfair.\" He recovered places in the race to finish fifth, assisted by crashes and mistakes from drivers ahead.\n\n2022\n\nIn February 2022, Norris signed a contract extension with McLaren that will see him be with the team until at least 2025. He completed all three days of pre-season testing in Bahrain after teammate Ricciardo tested positive for COVID-19 and was unable to attend.\n\n2023\n\nNorris remained with McLaren for 2023, partnered by rookie Oscar Piastri who replaced Ricciardo. At the first race at Bahrain, both McLaren cars experienced reliability issues. Norris made six pit stops to manage the problem and finished seventeenth and last of the finishing drivers. He was eliminated in the first qualifying session (Q1) for the first time since 2019 at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix after hitting the wall. He received damage from debris on the opening lap and again finished seventeenth. The Australian Grand Prix saw McLaren score their first points of the season; Piastri finished eighth and Norris improved from thirteenth at the start to sixth at the finish. Another Q1 knockout at the Miami Grand Prix and contact with Nyck de Vries at the start resulted in another finish outside the points. He qualified third at the Spanish Grand Prix but first-lap contact with Lewis Hamilton dropped him to the back. He was demoted from a points finish at the Canadian Grand Prix with a penalty for \"unsportsmanlike behavior\" after slowing excessively whilst entering the pit lane to create a gap to Piastri ahead.\n\n2024: Maiden Win\n\nAhead of the 2024 season, Norris signed a new multi-year contract with McLaren. He finished sixth at the first race, the Bahrain Grand Prix, and took his first podium of the season at the Australian Grand Prix, starting and finishing third. He took the season's first sprint pole at the Chinese Grand Prix but dropped positions on the opening lap of the sprint and finished sixth. For the main race, he qualified fourth, overtook Fernando Alonso, and gained on Sergio Pérez in the pits to finish second, his fifteenth Formula One podium. At the Miami Grand Prix, he retired from the sprint after a first-corner collision with Alonso. He qualified fifth for the main race and led the race after the drivers ahead had made pit stops. A subsequent safety car allowed Norris to pit and retain his lead, which he held ahead of Verstappen at the restart to claim his maiden Grand Prix victory after 110 races and with his 16th podium finish, tying the record for the most podiums before taking a first win, a record he now shares with Patrick Depailler, Mika Häkkinen, Eddie Irvine, and Jean Alesi.\n\nEndurance Racing\n\nIt was announced that Norris would join United Autosports in order to race in the 2018 24 Hours of Daytona in the 2018 IMSA SportsCar Championship alongside two-time Formula One champion Fernando Alonso, as well as the 2016-17 Asian Le Mans Series LMP3 champion Philip Hanson. Norris and his team finished the race in 13th place in their class and 38th position overall. Following the race, Alonso hailed Norris' \"impressive speed,\" and stated: \"The stints he did were very impressive – the teamwork, the preparation, the focus.\"\n\nOther Ventures\n\nNorris raised $12,000 for the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund in support of the World Health Organization during an online streaming event on Twitch. He also founded Team Quadrant, an esports team which also focuses on content creation and apparel, in 2020. In January 2024, YouTuber Will Lenney (also known by his YouTube pseudonym WillNE) became a co-owner and investor of Team Quadrant.\n\nAwards\n\nNorris has received several awards and accolades throughout his career, including:\n\n* 2016: Toyota Racing Series champion\n* 2017: FIA Formula 2 champion\n* 2019: McLaren Autosport BRDC Award winner\n* 2020: Formula One Drivers' Champion

His life was marked by his involvement in the illicit drug trade, from his early days as a jeweler and precious metals broker in the United States to his rise as a key player in the Cali Cartel's distribution network.\n\n**Early Years**\n\nHerrera grew up in the Colombian town of Palmira, in the Valle del Cauca Department. During his high school years, he studied technical maintenance, which would later prove to be a valuable skill in his career as a drug trafficker. After completing his studies, Herrera moved to the United States, where he worked as a jeweler and precious metals broker. However, he soon became involved in the illicit drug trade, selling cocaine in New York City.\n\nHerrera's involvement in the drug trade led to his first run-ins with the law. In 1975 and 1978, he was arrested on distribution charges in New York City. These early arrests did not deter Herrera, and he continued to work in the illicit drug trade, eventually becoming a key player in the Cali Cartel's distribution network.\n\n**Cali Cartel**\n\nIn 1983, Herrera traveled to Cali, Colombia, to negotiate supply and distribution rights with the Cali Cartel for New York City. The Cali Cartel, led by the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, was one of the most powerful drug trafficking organizations in Colombia at the time. Herrera's connections with the Cali Cartel proved to be invaluable, and he soon established trafficking routes for the organization through Mexico.\n\nHerrera's role in the Cali Cartel's distribution network was significant. He worked closely with the organization's leaders to establish and maintain relationships with other drug trafficking organizations and to coordinate the transportation and sale of cocaine. His experience as a jeweler and precious metals broker also proved to be useful in the organization's money laundering operations.\n\n**Law Enforcement Actions**\n\nIn November 1991, the DEA launched Operation Kingpin, a large-scale investigation into the Cali Cartel's distribution network in New York City. The operation targeted two of Herrera's distribution cells, and it involved a significant wiretap effort. Over 100 simultaneous, court-authorized wiretaps were placed on cellular phones, allowing the DEA to gather extensive evidence of the organization's activities.\n\nAt the close of Operation Kingpin, nearly 100 traffickers were arrested, and more than $20 million in cash and assets were seized. Over 2.5 tons of cocaine were also seized, and records of transactions and personnel were obtained from computers. This information provided a greater understanding of the Cali Cartel's cell structure and helped to bring the organization's leaders to justice.\n\n**Surrender and Death**\n\nOn September 1, 1996, Herrera turned himself in to the Search Bloc, a unit of the Colombian National Police. He was the last of the four leaders of the Cali Cartel to be captured. Herrera was sentenced to 6 years and 8 months in prison for drug trafficking charges, but his sentence was later extended to 14 years in 1998.\n\nHerrera's surrender and subsequent imprisonment marked the end of his involvement in the illicit drug trade. His legacy, however, continued to be felt, and he remained a prominent figure in the world of organized crime.\n\n**Sexual Orientation**\n\nHerrera's sexual orientation has been the subject of speculation and debate. In the book \"La patrona de Pablo Escobar,\" written by Colombian journalist José Guarnizo, Herrera is described as \"an immigrant who went from being an anonymous Latin mechanic to one of the wealthiest members of the Cartel de Cali\" and \"one of the few homosexuals who climbed high in the pyramid of the Mafia.\" At the time, Herrera's crimes overshadowed any speculation regarding his sexual orientation.\n\nIn the Netflix drama \"Narcos,\" Herrera is portrayed as openly gay. This portrayal has sparked debate and discussion about Herrera's sexual orientation and its potential impact on his involvement in the illicit drug trade.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nHerrera's life and involvement in the illicit drug trade have been the subject of numerous books, articles, and documentaries. His story has also been featured in several popular culture works, including the Netflix drama \"Narcos.\"\n\nIn \"Narcos,\" Herrera is portrayed by actor Matt Whelan. The show's portrayal of Herrera has been praised for its accuracy and attention to detail. The show's creators worked closely with law enforcement officials and experts to ensure that the depiction of Herrera and the Cali Cartel was accurate and realistic.\n\nOverall, Hélmer Herrera's life and involvement in the illicit drug trade have had a significant impact on the world of organized crime. His story continues to be felt, and he remains a prominent figure in the world of popular culture.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hélmer_Herrera\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly years\nHerrera grew up in the Colombian town of Palmira, in the Valle del Cauca Department While in high school, Herrera studied technical maintenance, experience that got him a job later in the United States  Living in the United States, he also became a jeweler and precious metals broker until he began selling cocaine in New York City In 1975, and 1978, Herrera was arrested on distribution charges in New York City for selling cocaine [2] [3] [4]\n\n\nCali Cartel\nIn 1983, Herrera went to Cali, Colombia, to negotiate supply and distribution rights with the Cali Cartel for New York City He later opened up trafficking routes for the Cali Cartel through Mexico, with connections he had previously established.\n\n\nLaw enforcement actions\nIn November 1991, the DEA launched Operation Kingpin, which targeted two of Herrera's distribution cells in New York City Through a large-scale wiretap effort, the DEA utilized over 100 simultaneous, court-authorized wiretaps on cellular phones At the close of Operation Kingpin, nearly 100 traffickers were arrested, and more than $20 million in cash and assets, and over 2.5 tons of cocaine seized In addition, records of transactions and personnel were seized from computers, which information later provided a greater look into the Cali Cartel cell structure [9]\n\n\nSurrender and death\nOn September 1, 1996, Herrera turned himself in to the Search Bloc (Spanish: Bloque de Busqueda), a unit of the Colombian National Police [3] Herrera was the last of the four leaders of the Cali Cartel to be captured [4] [5] He was sentenced to 6 years and 8 months in prison for drug trafficking charges, [10] which was extended to 14 years in 1998 [7]\n\n\nSexual orientation\nIn the book, La patrona de Pablo Escobar, written by Colombian journalist José Guarnizo, Herrera was described as \"an immigrant who went from being an anonymous Latin mechanic to one of the wealthiest members of the Cartel de Cali\" and \"one of the few homosexuals who climbed high in the pyramid of the Mafia\" [13] At the time, Herrera's crimes overshadowed any speculation regarding his sexual orientation In the Netflix drama Narcos, Herrera is portrayed as openly gay.\n\n\nIn popular culture\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on March 12, 1948, in Boston, Massachusetts, Taylor is known for his soothing voice, acoustic guitar-driven sound, and introspective lyrics.\n\n**Early Years**\n\nTaylor's family moved to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where he spent his childhood. His father, Isaac M. Taylor, was a physician who worked at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and his mother, Gertrude (née Woodard), was an aspiring opera singer. Taylor's ancestry includes English and Scottish roots, with his ancestors hailing from the Taylor family of Montrose, Scotland. His great-grandfather, Edmund Rice, was an English colonist who co-founded Sudbury, Massachusetts.\n\nTaylor's siblings include Alex Taylor, Kate Taylor, Livingston Taylor, and Hugh Taylor, all of whom are musicians. Alex, his younger brother, was also a musician and died in 1993 due to complications from alcoholism. Livingston, his older brother, is a musician who has released several albums. Hugh, his youngest sibling, is a musician who eventually left the music industry and now operates a bed-and-breakfast in Aquinnah, Massachusetts.\n\n**Career**\n\nTaylor's music career began in the 1960s when he attended Elon University for a semester before moving to New York City to form a band. He recruited Joel O'Brien, formerly of King Bees, and Zachary Wiesner, his childhood friend, to join the band. They called themselves the Flying Machine and played songs that Taylor had written while at McLean Hospital, where he was a patient for depression. Taylor was plagued by self-doubt, and his songs often romanticized his life.\n\nIn 1966, the Flying Machine began performing regularly at the Night Owl Cafe in Greenwich Village, alongside acts such as the Turtles and Lothar and the Hand People. Taylor's music was gaining attention, and he was becoming more confident in his abilities.\n\n**1966-1969: Early Career**\n\nDuring this period, Taylor continued to write and perform music. He was part of the Flying Machine, and they were gaining a following in the New York City music scene. Taylor's music was a mix of folk, rock, and pop, and he was becoming known for his soothing voice and acoustic guitar-driven sound.\n\n**1970-1972: Warner Bros. and Career Breakthrough**\n\nIn 1970, Taylor released his second album, Sweet Baby James, which was a critical and commercial success. The album featured the participation of Carole King and included the hit single \"Fire and Rain.\" The album reached No. 3 on the Billboard charts and sold over 1.5 million copies in its first year. Sweet Baby James was a folk-rock masterpiece that effectively showcased Taylor's talents to the mainstream public.\n\nThe album earned several Grammy Award nominations, including Album of the Year, and went on to be listed at No. 103 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003. The single \"Fire and Rain\" was also listed as No. 227 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2004.\n\n**1973-1976: Continued Success and Greatest Hits**\n\nIn 1973, Taylor spent most of the year enjoying his new life as a married man and did not return to the recording studio until January 1974. He released Walking Man, which featured appearances by Paul and Linda McCartney and guitarist David Spinozza. The album was a critical and commercial disaster and was his first album to miss the Top 5 since his contract with Warner.\n\nThe title track failed to appear on the Top 100, and the album received poor reviews. It sold only 300,000 copies in the United States.\n\n**1977-1981: Move to Columbia Records**\n\nIn 1977, Taylor signed with Columbia Records and released JT, which gave him his best reviews since Sweet Baby James. The album earned a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year in 1978 and reached No. 4 on the Billboard charts. It sold over 3 million copies in the United States alone and was propelled by the single \"Handy Man,\" which hit No. 1 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart.\n\nThe success of the album propelled the release of two further singles: \"Your Smiling Face\" and \"Honey Don't Leave L.A.\" The album also gave Taylor his first Grammy since JT, when he was honored with Best Pop Album in 1998.\n\n**1981-1996: Troubled Times and New Beginnings**\n\nIn 1981, Taylor announced his separation from his wife, Carly Simon, saying that their needs were different and it seemed impossible to stay together. Their divorce was finalized in 1983. Taylor was living on West End Avenue in Manhattan and was on a methadone maintenance program to cure his of his drug addiction.\n\nOver the course of four months, starting in September 1983, Taylor discontinued methadone and overcame his heroin habit. He was motivated by the deaths of his friends John Belushi and Dennis Wilson and the desire to be a better father to his children Sally and Ben.\n\n**1997-2008**\n\nIn 1997, Taylor released Hourglass, an introspective album that gave him the best critical reviews in almost twenty years. The album had much of its focus on Taylor's troubled past and family. \"Jump Up Behind Me\" paid tribute to his father's rescue of him after The Flying Machine days, and the long drive from New York City back to his home in Chapel Hill.\n\n\"Enough To Be on Your Way\" was inspired by the alcoholism-related death of his brother Alex earlier in the decade. The themes were also inspired by Taylor and Walker's divorce, which took place in 1996. Critics embraced the dark themes on the album, and Hourglass was a commercial success, reaching No. 9 on the Billboard 200.\n\n**Barack Obama's 2008 Campaign and Inaugural Celebration**\n\nDuring October 19-21, 2008, Taylor performed a series of free concerts in five North Carolina cities in support of Barack Obama's presidential bid.

five out of five played cups Omonia was then accepted by the Cyprus Football Association to participate in the Cypriot First Division.\n\n\nCreation and early years (1948–1953)\nOn 23 May 1948, the governing board of APOEL football club sent a telegram to the Hellenic Association of Amateur Athletics (Greek: Σ.Ε.Γ.Α.Σ.), with the opportunity of the annual Panhellenic Track and Field Competition

Federation in December 1948 Omonia took part in the CAFF league until 1953, having won four out of five played championships and five out of five played cups Omonia was then accepted by the Cyprus Football Association to participate in the Cypriot First Division.\n\n\nBeginnings in the Cypriot First Division (1953–1969)\nAfter joining the Cypriot First Division in 1953, Omonia only placed seventh out of nine teams in the 1953–54 season, barely avoiding relegation During that decade, the club's best placing came during the 1956–57 season when the club finished in the third position.\n\n\nGolden era (1970s–1980s)\nOmonia won its first trophies of the decade in 1972, when the club won both the league and the cup Led by a young Sotiris Kaiafas, Omonia won seven league titles in the 1970s, six of them were consecutive (1974–1979) [5] At the end of the decade, Omonia had a total of nine championship titles and three cups At the end of the 1979 season, Omonia trailed its arch-rival APOEL by two championships In 1976, Sotiris Kaiafas would go on and win the European Golden Shoe for his single-season 39-goal performance [6] In 2003, he was awarded the UEFA Jubilee Awards for the Best Cypriot Footballer of the 20th century.\n\n\nGeneral decline (1990s)\nThe 1990s would prove to be less successful than the previous two decades During this time, Omonia only mustered one Cypriot League title during the 1992–93 season It would be eight years before Omonia would see its next title In 1997, Omonia signed the German Rainer Rauffmann, who would later become the second top goalscorer ever for the club With the help of other Omonia great and then captain, Costas Malekkos, and a young Costas Kaiafas (the son of Sotiris Kaiafas), Rauffmann would become top scorer of the Cypriot First Division in 1997–98, 1998–99, 1999–00 and 2000–01 seasons and led Omonia to two titles [7]\n\n\nRevival (2000s)\nAfter a disappointing eight seasons, the 2000s decade began with a trophy Omonia celebrated its 18th Cypriot league championship title in 2001 Now captained by Costas Kaiafas, Omonia would win its 19th Cypriot League Championship again in 2003 Since 2003, however, the team would stumble and be without a title for the next several years After numerous seasons of poor signings and underachieving, Omonia's reigns would be taken over by new chairman and team president, Miltiadis Neophytou in 2008.\n\n\nFinancial crisis (2012–2018)\nHead coach Neophytos Larkou left the club in September 2012 [15] and Toni Savevski was then appointed as coach The team began the season with a great win but found its second success after several games A disappointing first round proved enough to exclude the club from contesting for the championship or the cup The team managed better results in the second round, finishing the season in third place [16] Thousands of fans answered the president's call to donate as much as they could and the financial issues of the club improved Omonia was knocked out in the semi-finals of the cup by AEL Limassol.\n\n\nPapastavrou era (2018–present)\nThe decline of the club's football department and the financial difficulties it faced convinced many that a change in the way the club was being run was needed In May 2018, a general assembly was called and members voted to hand the football department over to Stavros Papastavrou, an American-based Cypriot businessman [31] [32] He has stated that he will provide funds for the development of the club's academies and training grounds, and that the potential creation of a new stadium will be considered [33] The agreement, initially set for 10 years, was extended indefinitely in 2023 [34] In the club's first season under Papastavrou's ownership, Omonia

Zdinarsk in Avatar: The Way of Water Terry Notary, who performed stunts as well, plays the Banshees via motion capture.\n\n\nProduction\nIn 1994, [12] director James Cameron wrote an 80-page treatment for Avatar, drawing inspiration from science fiction books he had read in his childhood, as well as from adventure novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs and H Rider Haggard [11] Parts of the movie also came to him in a dream when he was 19 years old He dreamed about a bioluminescent forest with fiber-optic trees, fan lizards, a river with bioluminescent particles and a purple moss that lit up when stepped on When he woke up, he made a drawing of the scene and later used it in the movie [60] In August 1996, Cameron announced that after completing Titanic, he would film Avatar, which would make use of synthetic, or computer-generated, actors [14] The project would cost $100 million and involve at least six actors in leading roles \"who appear to be real but do not exist in the physical world\" [61] Visual effects house Digital Domain, with whom Cameron has a partnership, joined the project, which was supposed to begin production in mid-1997 for a 1999 release [13] However, Cameron felt that the technology had not caught up with the story and vision that he intended to tell He decided to concentrate on making documentaries and refining the technology for the next few years It was revealed in a Bloomberg BusinessWeek cover story that 20th Century Fox had fronted $10 million to Cameron to film a proof-of-concept clip for Avatar, which he showed to Fox executives in October 2005 [62]\n\n\nOrigins\nIn 1994, [12] director James Cameron wrote an 80-page treatment for Avatar, drawing inspiration from science fiction books he had read in his childhood, as well as from adventure novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs and H Rider Haggard [11] Parts of the movie also came to him in a dream when he was 19 years old He dreamed about a bioluminescent forest with fiber-optic

to film a proof-of-concept clip for Avatar, which he showed to Fox executives in October 2005 [62]\n\n\nDevelopment\nFrom January to April 2006, Cameron worked on the script and developed a culture for the Na'vi, the film's aliens The Na'vi language was created by Paul Frommer, a linguist at USC [11] The Na'vi language has a lexicon of about 1000 words, with some 30 added by Cameron The tongue's phonemes include ejective consonants (such as the \"kx\" in \"skxawng\") that are found in Amharic, and the initial \"ng\" that Cameron may have taken from Te Reo Māori [16] Actress Sigourney Weaver and the film's set designers met with Jodie S Holt, professor of plant physiology at University of California, Riverside, to learn about the methods used by botanists to study and sample plants, and to discuss ways to explain the communication between Pandora's organisms depicted in the film [65]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography for Avatar began in April 2007 in Los Angeles and Wellington Cameron described the film as a hybrid with a full live-action shoot in combination with computer-generated characters and live environments \"Ideally at the end of the day the audience has no idea which they're looking at,\" Cameron said The director indicated that he had already worked four months on nonprincipal scenes for the film [76] The live action was shot with a modified version of the proprietary digital 3D Fusion Camera System, developed by Cameron and Vince Pace [77] In January 2007, Fox had announced that 3D filming for Avatar would be done at 24 frames per second, despite Cameron's strong opinion that a 3D film requires a higher frame rate to make strobing less noticeable [78] According to Cameron, the film is composed of 60% computer-generated elements and 40% live action, as well as traditional miniatures [79]\n\n\nVisual effects\nA number of innovative visual effects techniques were used during production According to Cameron, work on the film had been delayed since the 1990s to allow the techniques to reach the necessary degree of advancement to adequately portray his vision of the film [13] [14] The director planned to make use of photorealistic computer-generated characters, created using new motion capture animation technologies he had been developing in the 14 months leading up to December 2006 [84]\n\n\nMusic and soundtrack\nComposer James Horner scored the film, his third collaboration with Cameron after Aliens and Titanic [108] Horner recorded parts of the score with a small chorus singing in the alien language Na'vi in March 2008 [109]\nHe also worked with Wanda Bryant, an ethnomusicologist, to create a music culture for the alien race [110]\nThe first scoring sessions were planned to take place in early 2009 [111] During production, Horner promised Cameron that he would not work on any other project except for Avatar and reportedly worked on the score from four in the morning until ten at night throughout the process He stated in an interview, \"Avatar has been the most difficult film I have worked on and the biggest job I have undertaken.\" [112] Horner composed the score as two different scores merged into one He first created a score that reflected the Na'vi way of sound and then combined it with a separate \"traditional\" score to drive the film [82]\nBritish singer Leona Lewis was chosen to sing the theme song for the film, called \"I See You\" An accompanying music video, directed by Jake Nava, premiered December 15, 2009, on MySpace [113]\n\n\nThemes and inspirations\nAvatar is primarily an action-adventure journey of self-discovery, in the context of imperialism, and deep ecology [114]\nCameron said his inspiration was \"every single science fiction book I read as a kid\" and that he wanted to update the style of Edgar Rice Burroughs' John Carter series [11] He acknowledged that Avatar shares themes with the films At Play in the Fields of the Lord, The Emerald Forest, and Princess Mononoke, which feature clashes between cultures and civilizations, and with Dances with Wolves, where a battered soldier finds himself drawn to the culture he was initially fighting against [115] [116] He also cited Hayao Miyazaki's anime films such as Princess Mononoke as an influence on the ecosystem of Pandora [116]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe first photo of the film was released on August 14,

would be 1.78:1 for 3D screenings and that a 2.39:1 image would be extracted for 2D screenings [169] [170] However, a 3D 2.39:1 extract was approved for use with constant-image-height screens, i.e.,

Avatar: Special Edition includes an additional nine minutes of footage, all of which is CG, [179] including an extension of the sex scene [180] and various other scenes that were cut from the original theatrical film [179] This extended re-release resulted in the film's run time approaching the then-current IMAX platter maximum of 170 minutes, thereby leaving less time for the end credits Cameron stated that the nine minutes of added scenes cost more than $1 million a minute to produce and finish [181] During its 12-week re-release, Avatar: Special Edition grossed an additional $10.74 million in North America and $22.46 million overseas for a worldwide total of $33.2 million [5] The film was later re-released in China in March 2021, allowing it to surpass Avengers: Endgame to become the highest-grossing film of all time [25]\n\n\nHome media\n20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the film on DVD and Blu-ray in the United States on April 22, 2010, [185] and in the United Kingdom on April 26 [186] The United States release was not on a Tuesday as is the norm, but was done to coincide with Earth Day [187] The first DVD and Blu-ray release does not contain any supplemental features other than the theatrical film and the disc menu in favor of and to make space for optimal picture and sound The release also preserves the film's 1.78:1 (16:9) format over the 2.39:1 (21:9) scope version, as Cameron felt that was the best format to watch the film [188] The Blu-ray disc contains DRM (BD+ 5) which some Blu-ray players might not support without a firmware update [189] [190]\n\n\nReception\n\n\n\nCritical response\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 82% of 337 reviews are positive, and the average rating is 7.5/10 The site's consensus reads: \"It might be more impressive on a technical level than as a piece of storytelling, but Avatar reaffirms James Cameron's singular gift for imaginative, absorbing filmmaking.\" [209] On Metacritic—which assigns a weighted mean score—the film has a score of 83 out of 100 based on 38 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\" [210] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale Every demographic surveyed was reported to give this rating These polls also indicated that the main draw of the film was its use of 3D [211]\n\n\nBox office\nAvatar was released internationally on more than 14,000 screens [254] It grossed $3,537,000 from midnight screenings in the United States and Canada, with the initial 3D release limited to 2,200 screens [255] The film

its release, various film critics and fan communities predicted the film would be a significant disappointment at the box office, in line with predictions made for Cameron's previous blockbuster Titanic [297] [298] [299] This criticism ranged from Avatar's film budget, to its concept and use of 3-D \"blue cat people\" [297] [298] Slate magazine's Daniel Engber complimented the 3D effects but criticized them for reminding him of certain CGI characters from the Star Wars prequel films and for having the \"uncanny valley\" effect [300] The New York Times noted that 20th Century Fox executives had decided to release Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel alongside Avatar, calling it a \"secret weapon\" to cover any unforeseeable losses at the box office [301]\n\n\nAccolades\nAvatar won the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best Visual Effects, and was nominated for a total of nine, including Best Picture and Best Director [314] Avatar also won the 67th Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture – Drama and Best Director, and was nominated for two others [315] At the 36th Saturn Awards, Avatar won all ten awards it was nominated for: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Writing, Best Music, Best Production Design and Best Special Effects.\n\n\nLegacy\nDespite the film's financial and critical success, some journalists have questioned Avatar's cultural impact [d] In 2014, Scott Mendelson of Forbes said the film had been \"all but forgotten\", citing the lack of merchandising, a fandom for the film, or any long-enduring media franchise, and further stated that he believed most general audiences could not remember any of the film's details, such as the names of its characters or actors in the cast Mendelson argued Avatar's only achievement of note to be its popularization of 3D cinema Despite this, he still felt it was a quality film, saying, \"A great blockbuster movie can just be a great blockbuster movie without capturing the lunchbox market.\" [320] He further reflected and reversed his stance in 2022 after the box office success of the re-release, saying, \"The very things that made Avatar sometimes feel like a 'forgotten blockbuster' have inspired a skewed renewed nostalgia for its singular existence It was just a movie, an original auteur-specific movie that prioritized top-shelf filmmaking and clockwork plotting over quotable dialogue and memes.\" [326]\n\n\nSequels\nAvatar's success led to two sequels; this number was subsequently expanded to four [333] Avatar: The Way of Water (2022) grossed over $2.3 billion, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2022, [334] and received a similarly positive critical and audience response [335] It will be followed by Avatar: Fire and Ash (2025) The fourth and fifth Avatar films are scheduled to be released in 2029 and 2031 [333]

four novels set within the \"Avatar expanded universe\", to be written by Steven Gould [159] The books were due to be published by Penguin Random House, although since 2017, there has been no update

The project was initially intended to be a live-action film, but Cameron decided to use computer-generated imagery (CGI) to bring the characters and world to life. The film was produced on a budget of $237 million and took four years to complete.\n\n**Origins**\n\nCameron's inspiration for Avatar came from his childhood love of science fiction and fantasy. He was particularly drawn to the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs and H. Rider Haggard, who wrote about exotic worlds and alien civilizations. Cameron wanted to create a film that would transport audiences to a new and fantastical world, and he spent years developing the story and characters.\n\n**Development**\n\nFrom January to April 2006, Cameron worked on the script and developed a culture for the Na'vi. The Na'vi language was created by Paul Frommer, a linguist at USC, and includes a lexicon of over 1,000 words. The film's set designers met with Jodie S Holt, a professor of plant physiology, to learn about the methods used by botanists to study and sample plants.\n\n**Filming**\n\nPrincipal photography for Avatar began in April 2007 in Los Angeles and Wellington. The film was shot with a modified version of the proprietary digital 3D Fusion Camera System, developed by Cameron and Vince Pace. The live-action was shot at 24 frames per second, despite Cameron's opinion that a 3D film requires a higher frame rate to make strobing less noticeable.\n\n**Visual effects**\n\nA number of innovative visual effects techniques were used during production, including motion capture animation and photorealistic CGI. The film's visual effects were created by Weta Digital, a visual effects company based in New Zealand. The company's team worked for over four years to bring the film's characters and world to life.\n\n**Music and soundtrack**\n\nThe film's score was composed by James Horner, who worked closely with Cameron to create a music culture for the Na'vi. The score features a combination of traditional and electronic elements, and was recorded in March 2008. The first scoring sessions were planned to take place in early 2009, and Horner worked on the score from four in the morning until ten at night throughout the process.\n\n**Themes and inspirations**\n\nAvatar is primarily an action-adventure journey of self-discovery, in the context of imperialism and deep ecology. Cameron's inspiration was every single science fiction book he read as a kid, and he wanted to update the style of Edgar Rice Burroughs' John Carter series. The film shares themes with the films At Play in the Fields of the Lord, The Emerald Forest, and Princess Mononoke.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe first photo of the film was released on August 14, 2009, and Empire released exclusive images from the film in its October issue. Cameron, producer Jon Landau, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, and Sigourney Weaver appeared at a panel moderated by Tom Rothman at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con. James Cameron announced at the Comic-Con Avatar Panel that August 21 would be \"Avatar Day,\" and the trailer was released in all theatrical formats.\n\n**Books**\n\nHarper Entertainment released Avatar: A Confidential Report on the Biological and Social History of Pandora, a 224-page book in the form of a field guide to the film's fictional setting of the planet of Pandora. The Art of Avatar was released on November 30, 2009, by Abrams Books, featuring detailed production artwork from the film.\n\n**Video game**\n\nCameron chose Ubisoft Montreal to create an Avatar game for the film in 2007. The game was released on December 1, 2009, for most home video game consoles and Microsoft Windows.\n\n**Action figures and postage stamps**\n\nMattel Toys announced in December 2009 that it would be introducing a line of Avatar action figures. Each action figure would be made with a 3-D web tag, called an i-TAG, that consumers could scan using a web cam.\n\n**Releases**\n\nAvatar premiered in London on December 10, 2009, and was released theatrically worldwide from December 16 to 18. The film was originally set for release on May 22, 2009, during filming, but was pushed back to allow more post-production time.\n\n**Initial screening**\n\nAvatar premiered in London on December 10, 2009, and was released theatrically worldwide from December 16 to 18. The film was originally set for release on May 22, 2009, during filming, but was pushed back to allow more post-production time.\n\n**Post-original release**\n\nIn July 2010, Cameron confirmed that there would be an extended theatrical rerelease of the film on August 27, 2010, exclusively in 3D theaters and IMAX 3D. The extended re-release resulted in the film's run time approaching the then-current IMAX platter maximum of 170 minutes.\n\n**Home media**\n\n20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the film on DVD and Blu-ray in the United States on April 22, 2010, and in the United Kingdom on April 26. The first DVD and Blu-ray release does not contain any supplemental features other than the theatrical film and the disc menu.\n\n**Reception**\n\nAvatar received widespread critical acclaim, with 82% of 337 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes being positive. The site's consensus reads: \"It might be more impressive on a technical level than as a piece of storytelling, but Avatar reaffirms James Cameron's singular gift for imaginative, absorbing filmmaking.\"\n\n**Box office**\n\nAvatar was released internationally on more than 14,000 screens and grossed $3,537,000 from midnight screenings in the United States and Canada. The film grossed $26,752,099 on its opening day and $77,025,481 over its opening weekend.\n\n**Commercial analysis**\n\nBefore its release, various film critics and fan communities predicted the film would be a significant disappointment at the box office, in line with predictions made for Cameron's previous blockbuster Titanic.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nAvatar won the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best Visual Effects. The film also won the 67th Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture – Drama and Best Director.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nDespite the film's financial and critical success, some journalists have questioned Avatar's cultural impact. Scott Mendelson of Forbes said the film had been \"all but forgotten,\" citing the lack of merchandising and a fandom for the film.\n\n**Sequels**\n\nAvatar's success led to two sequels, with a third announced in 2020. The sequels are scheduled to be released in 2024 and 2026.\n\n**Related media**\n\nToruk – The First Flight is an original stage production by the Montreal-based Cirque du Soleil, which ran between December 2015 and June 2019. The film's theme park attraction, Pandora – The World of Avatar, opened at Walt Disney World in 2017.\n\n**Novels**\n\nFollowing the release of Avatar, Cameron planned to write a novel based on the film. The novel was later replaced by a series of four novels set within the \"Avatar expanded universe,\" written by Steven Gould.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of highest-grossing films\n* List of James

inspiration from science fiction books he had read in his childhood, as well as from adventure novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs and H Rider Haggard [11] Parts of the movie also came to him in a dream when he was 19 years old He dreamed about a bioluminescent forest with fiber-optic trees, fan lizards, a river with bioluminescent particles and a purple moss that lit up when stepped on When he woke up, he made a drawing of the scene and later used it in the movie [60] In August 1996, Cameron announced that after completing Titanic, he would film Avatar, which would make use of synthetic, or computer-generated, actors [14] The project would cost $100 million and involve at least six actors in leading roles \"who appear to be real but do not exist in the physical world\" [61] Visual effects house Digital Domain, with whom Cameron has a partnership, joined the project, which was supposed to begin production in mid-1997 for a 1999 release [13] However, Cameron felt that the technology had not caught up with the story and vision that he intended to tell He decided to concentrate on making documentaries and refining the technology for the next few years It was revealed in a Bloomberg BusinessWeek cover story that 20th Century Fox had fronted $10 million to Cameron to film a proof-of-concept clip for Avatar, which he showed to Fox executives in October 2005

Na'vi, the film's aliens The Na'vi language was created by Paul Frommer, a linguist at USC [11] The Na'vi language has a lexicon of about 1000 words, with some 30 added by Cameron The tongue's phonemes include ejective consonants (such as the \"kx\" in \"skxawng\") that are found in Amharic, and the initial \"ng\" that Cameron may have taken from Te Reo Māori [16] Actress Sigourney Weaver and the film's set designers met with Jodie S Holt, professor of plant physiology at University of California, Riverside, to learn about the methods used by botanists to study and sample plants, and to discuss ways to explain the communication between Pandora's organisms depicted in the film [65]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography for Avatar began in April 2007 in Los Angeles and Wellington Cameron described the film as a hybrid with a full live-action shoot in combination with computer-generated characters and live environments \"Ideally at the end of the day the audience has no idea which they're looking at,\" Cameron said The director indicated that he had already worked four months on nonprincipal scenes for the film [76] The live action was shot with a modified version of the proprietary digital 3D Fusion Camera System, developed by Cameron and Vince Pace [77] In January 2007, Fox had announced that 3D filming for Avatar would be done at 24 frames per second, despite Cameron's strong opinion that a 3D film requires a higher frame rate to make strobing less noticeable [78] According to Cameron, the film is composed of 60% computer-generated elements and 40% live action, as well as traditional miniatures [79]\n\n\nVisual effects\nA number of innovative visual effects techniques were used during production According to Cameron, work on the film had been delayed since the 1990s to allow the techniques to reach the necessary degree of advancement to adequately portray his vision of the film [13] [14] The director planned to make use of photorealistic computer-generated characters, created using new motion capture animation technologies he had been developing in the 14 months leading up to December 2006 [84]\n\n\nMusic and soundtrack\nComposer James Horner scored the film, his third collaboration with Cameron after Aliens and Titanic [108] Horner recorded parts of the score with a small chorus singing in the alien language Na'vi in March 2008 [109]\nHe also worked with Wanda Bryant, an ethnomusicologist, to create a music culture for the alien race [110]\nThe first scoring sessions were planned to take place in early 2009 [111] During production, Horner promised Cameron that he would not work on any other project except for Avatar and reportedly worked on the score from four in the morning until ten at night throughout the process He stated in an interview, \"Avatar has been the most difficult film I have worked on and the biggest job I have undertaken.\" [112] Horner composed the score as two different scores merged into one He first created a score that reflected the Na'vi way of sound and then combined it with a separate \"traditional\" score to drive the film [82]\nBritish singer Leona Lewis was chosen to sing the theme song for the film, called \"I See You\" An accompanying music video, directed by Jake Nava, premiered December 15, 2009, on MySpace [113]\n\n\nThemes and inspirations\nAvatar is primarily an action-adventure journey of self-discovery, in the context of imperialism, and deep ecology [114]\nCameron said his inspiration was \"every single science fiction book I read as a kid\" and that he wanted to update the style of Edgar Rice Burroughs' John Carter series [11] He acknowledged that Avatar shares themes with the films At Play in the Fields of the Lord, The Emerald Forest, and Princess Mononoke, which feature clashes between cultures and civilizations, and with Dances with Wolves, where a battered soldier finds himself drawn to the culture he was initially fighting against [115] [116] He also cited Hayao Miyazaki's anime films such as Princess Mononoke as an influence on the ecosystem of Pandora [116]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe first photo of the film was released on August 14,

its release, various film critics and fan communities predicted the film would be a significant disappointment at the box office, in line with predictions made for Cameron's previous blockbuster Titanic [297] [298] [299] This criticism ranged from Avatar's film budget, to its concept and use of 3-D \"blue cat people\" [297] [298] Slate magazine's Daniel Engber complimented the 3D effects but criticized them for reminding him of certain CGI characters from the Star Wars prequel films and for having the \"uncanny valley\" effect [300] The New York Times noted that 20th Century Fox executives had decided to release Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel alongside Avatar, calling it a \"secret weapon\" to cover any unforeseeable losses at the box office [301]\n\n\nAccolades\nAvatar won the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best Visual Effects, and was nominated for a total of nine, including Best Picture and Best

Best Special Effects.\n\n\nLegacy\nDespite the film's financial and critical success, some journalists have questioned Avatar's cultural impact [d] In 2014, Scott Mendelson of Forbes said the film had been \"all but forgotten\", citing the lack of merchandising, a fandom for the film, or any long-enduring media franchise, and further stated that he believed most general audiences could not remember any of the film's details, such as the names of its characters or actors in the cast Mendelson argued Avatar's only achievement of note to be its popularization of 3D cinema Despite this, he still felt it was a quality film, saying, \"A great blockbuster movie can just be a great blockbuster movie without capturing the lunchbox market.\" [320] He further reflected and reversed his stance in 2022 after the box office success of the re-release, saying, \"The very things that made Avatar sometimes feel like a 'forgotten blockbuster' have inspired a skewed renewed nostalgia for its singular existence It was just a movie, an original auteur-specific movie that prioritized top-shelf filmmaking and clockwork plotting over quotable dialogue and memes.\" [326]\n\n\nSequels\nAvatar's success led to two sequels; this number was subsequently expanded to four [333] Avatar: The Way of Water (2022) grossed over $2.3 billion, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2022, [334] and received a similarly positive critical and audience response [335] It will be followed by Avatar: Fire and Ash (2025) The fourth and fifth Avatar films are scheduled to be released in 2029 and 2031 [333]

It allows users to hold virtual meetings and conferences with up to 30 participants. The app was initially available only to users with Google Workspace accounts, but was later expanded to include personal Google accounts.\n\n**History**\n\nGoogle Meet was first released in February 2017 as an invite-only service. At the time, it was available only through applications for desktop, Android, and iOS. In March 2017, Google formally launched Meet, touting it as an enterprise-friendly version of Hangouts. The service was initially designed for use in conference room settings, where it could be easily integrated with other Google tools and services.\n\nIn 2020, Google rolled out Meet to personal Google accounts, making it available to users who did not have a Google Workspace account. This expansion helped to increase the app's user base and made it a more mainstream option for virtual meetings.\n\n**Platforms**\n\nGoogle Meet is available on a range of platforms, including:\n\n* Android devices\n* iOS devices\n* Web application\n* Android TV (launched in 2022)\n* Samsung Smart TV (launched in October 2022)\n\nThe app can be accessed through a web browser or by downloading the app from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store. On Android TV, users can access the app through the Google Play Store, but it does not currently support creating or joining meetings. On Samsung Smart TV, users can access the app through the TV's built-in apps menu, but it was discontinued on March 9, 2024.\n\n**Features**\n\nGoogle Meet offers a range of features that make it a popular choice for virtual meetings. Some of the key features include:\n\n### **Google Workspace accounts**\n\nUsers who have a Google Workspace account can take advantage of a range of features, including:\n\n* High-definition video\n* High-quality audio\n* Screen sharing\n* Live captioning\n* Noise cancellation\n* Integration with other Google tools and services\n\n### **Personal accounts**\n\nUsers who have a personal Google account can also use Google Meet to hold virtual meetings. They will have access to many of the same features as users with a Google Workspace account, but may not have the same level of integration with other Google tools and services.\n\n### **Technologies**\n\nGoogle Meet uses a range of technologies to ensure high-quality video and audio. These include:\n\n* VP8 and VP9 video codecs for video stream compression\n* Opus audio codec for voice stream compression\n* AV1 video codec (announced in April 2020)\n* Lyra very low-bitrate codec for speech compression (announced in February 2021)\n\nThe Lyra codec is designed to work with network speeds as low as 3 kbit/s and uses machine learning models to compress and transmit voice signals. This allows for high-quality audio even in low-bandwidth environments.\n\n### **Hardware**\n\nIn May 2020, Asus unveiled a range of videoconferencing hardware designed for use with Google Meet in conference room settings. This includes a \"Meet Compute System\" mini PC and a dedicated camera and microphone.\n\n**See also**\n\nGoogle Meet is a popular choice for virtual meetings and conferences.

{"title": "White_House", "content": "\nEarly history\nFollowing his April 1789 inauguration, President George Washington occupied two private houses in New York City, which served as the executive mansion He lived at the first, the Walter Franklin House, which was owned by Treasury Commissioner Samuel Osgood, at 3 Cherry Street, through late February 1790 [7] [8]  The executive mansion moved to the larger quarters at Alexander Macomb House at 39–41 Broadway, [8] where Washington stayed with his wife Martha and a small staff until August 1790 In May 1790, construction began on a new official residence in Manhattan called Government House.\n\n\n1789–1800\nFollowing his April 1789 inauguration, President George Washington occupied two private houses in New York City, which served as the executive mansion He lived at the first, the Walter Franklin House, which was owned by Treasury Commissioner Samuel Osgood, at 3 Cherry Street, through late February 1790 [7] [8]  The executive mansion moved to the larger quarters at Alexander Macomb House at 39–41 Broadway, [8] where Washington stayed with his wife Martha and a small staff until August 1790 In May 1790, construction began on a new official residence in Manhattan called Government House.\n\n\nArchitectural competition\nThe President's House was a major feature of Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant's [a] 1791 plan for the newly established federal city of Washington, D.C [15] After L'Enfant's dismissal in early 1792, Washington and his Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, who both had personal interests in architecture, agreed that the design of the President's House and the Capitol would be chosen in a design competition [16]\n\n\nDesign influences\nThe Neoclassical design of the White House is based primarily on architectural concepts inherited from the Roman architect Vitruvius and the Venetian architect Andrea Palladio The design of the upper floors also includes elements based on Dublin's Leinster House, which later became the seat of the Irish parliament (Oireachtas) [20] The upper windows with alternate triangular and segmented pediments are inspired by the Irish building [21] Additionally, several Georgian-era Irish country houses have been suggested as sources of inspiration for the overall floor plan, including the bow-fronted south front and the former niches in the present-day Blue Room.\n\n\nConstruction\nConstruction of the White House began at noon on October 13, 1792, with the laying of the cornerstone [24] [25] The main residence and foundations of the house were built largely by both enslaved and free African-American laborers, and employed Europeans [26] Much of the other work on the house was done by immigrants, many of whom had not yet obtained citizenship, including the sandstone walls, which were erected by Scottish immigrants [27], the high-relief rose, and garland decorations above the north entrance and the fish scale pattern beneath the pediments of the window hoods.\n\n\nArchitectural description\nThe main entrance is located on the north façade under a porte cochere with Ionic columns [32] The ground floor is hidden by a raised carriage ramp and parapet The central three bays are situated behind a prostyle portico that was added c. 1830 The windows of the four bays flanking the portico, at first-floor level, have alternating pointed and segmented pediments, while the second-floor pediments are flat A lunette fanlight and a sculpted floral festoon surmount the entrance The roofline is hidden by a balustraded parapet.\n\n\nNaming conventions\nThe building was originally variously referred to as the President's Palace, Presidential Mansion, or President's House [34] The earliest evidence of the public calling it the \"White House\" was recorded in 1811 [35] A myth emerged that during the rebuilding of the structure after the Burning of Washington, white paint was applied to mask the burn damage it had suffered, [36] giving the building its namesake hue [37] The name \"Executive Mansion\" was used in official contexts until President Theodore Roosevelt established \"The White House\" as its formal name in 1901 via Executive Order [38] The current letterhead wording and arrangement of \"The White House\" with the word \"Washington\" centered beneath it dates to the administration of Franklin D Roosevelt [39]\n\n\nEvolution of the White House\nOn Saturday, November 1, 1800, John Adams became the first president to take residence in the building [27] The next day he wrote his wife Abigail:\n\"I pray Heaven to bestow the best of blessings on this House, and all that shall hereafter inhabit it May none but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof.\" [41]\nPresident Franklin D Roosevelt had Adams's blessing carved into the mantel in the State Dining Room [41]\n\n\nEarly use, 1814 burning, and reconstruction\nOn Saturday, November 1, 1800, John Adams became the first president to take residence in the building [27] The next day he wrote his wife Abigail:\n\"I pray Heaven to bestow the best of blessings on this House, and all that shall hereafter inhabit it May none but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof.\" [41]\nPresident Franklin D Roosevelt had Adams's blessing carved into the mantel in the State Dining Room [41]\n\n\nOvercrowding and building the West Wing\nBy the time of the American Civil War, the White House had become overcrowded The location of the White House, just north of a canal and swampy lands, which provided conditions ripe for malaria and other unhealthy conditions, was questioned [55] Brigadier General Nathaniel Michler was tasked with proposing solutions to address these concerns He proposed abandoning the use of the White House as a residence, and he designed a new estate for the first family at Meridian Hill in Washington, D.C Congress, however, rejected the plan [55] Another option was Metropolis View, which is now the campus of The Catholic University of America [56]\n\n\nTruman reconstruction\nDecades of poor maintenance, the construction of a fourth-story attic during the Coolidge administration, and the addition of a second-floor balcony over the south portico for Harry S Truman [65] took a great toll on the brick and sandstone structure built around a timber frame [27] By 1948, the house was declared to be in imminent danger of collapse, forcing President Truman to commission a reconstruction and to live across the street at Blair House from 1949 to 1951 [66]\n\n\nJacqueline Kennedy restoration\nJacqueline Kennedy, wife of President John F Kennedy (1961–63), directed a very extensive and historic redecoration of the house She enlisted the help of Henry Francis du Pont of the Winterthur Museum to assist in collecting artifacts for the mansion, many of which had once been housed there [69] Other antiques, fine paintings, and improvements from the Kennedy period were donated to the White House by wealthy philanthropists, including the Crowninshield family, Jane Engelhard, Jayne Wrightsman, and the Oppenheimer family.\n\n\nThe White House since the Kennedy restoration\nCongress enacted legislation in September 1961 declaring the White House a museum Furniture, fixtures, and decorative arts could now be declared either historic or of artistic interest by the president This prevented them from being sold (as many objects in the executive mansion had been in the past 150 years) When not in use or display at the White House, these items were to be turned over to the Smithsonian Institution for preservation, study, storage, or exhibition The White House retains the right to have these items returned [63]: 29 \n\n\nLayout and amenities\nThe current group of buildings housing the presidency is known as the White House Complex It includes the central Executive Residence flanked by the East Wing and West Wing The chief usher coordinates day to day household operations The White House includes six stories and 55,000 square feet (5,100 m2) of floor space, 132 rooms and 35 bathrooms, 412 doors, 147 windows, 28 fireplaces, eight staircases, three elevators, five full-time chefs, a tennis court, a (single-lane) bowling alley, a movie theater (officially called the White House Family Theater [86]), a jogging track, a swimming pool, and a putting green [39] It receives up to 30,000 visitors each week [87]\n\n\nExecutive Residence\nThe original residence is in the center Two colonnades – one on the east and one on the west – designed by Jefferson, now serve to connect the East and West Wings added later The Executive Residence houses the president's dwelling, as well as rooms for ceremonies and official entertaining The State Floor of the residence building includes the East Room, Green Room, Blue Room, Red Room, State Dining Room, Family Dining Room, Cross Hall, Entrance Hall, and Grand Staircase [88] The Ground Floor is made up of the Diplomatic Reception Room, Map Room, China Room, Vermeil Room, Library, the main kitchen, and other offices [89]\n\n\nWest Wing\nThe West Wing houses the president's office (the Oval Office) and offices of his senior staff, with room for about 50 employees It includes the Cabinet Room, where the president conducts business meetings and where the Cabinet meets, [92] as well as the White House Situation Room, James S Brady Press Briefing Room, and the Roosevelt Room [93] In 2007, work was completed on renovations of the press briefing room, adding fiber optic cables and LCD screens for the display of charts and graphs [94] The makeover took 11 months and cost of $8 million, of which news outlets paid $2 million [94] In September 2010, a two-year project began on the West Wing, creating a multistory underground structure [95]\n\n\nEast Wing\nThe East Wing, which contains additional office space, was added to the White House in 1942 Among its uses, the East Wing has intermittently housed the offices and staff of the first lady and the White House Social Office Rosalynn Carter, in 1977, was the first to place her personal office in the East Wing and to formally call it the \"Office of the First Lady\" The East Wing was built during World War II in order to hide the construction of an underground bunker to be used in emergencies The bunker has come to be known as the Presidential Emergency Operations Center.\n\n\nGrounds\nThe White House and grounds cover just over 18 acres (about 7.3 hectares) Before the construction of the North Portico, most public events were entered from the South Lawn, the grading and planting of which was ordered by Thomas Jefferson Jefferson also drafted a planting plan for the North Lawn that included large trees that would have mostly obscured the house from Pennsylvania Avenue During the mid-to-late 19th century a series of ever larger greenhouses were built on the west side of the house, where the current West Wing is located During this period, the North Lawn was planted with ornate carpet-style flowerbeds.\n\n\nPublic access and security\nLike the English and Irish country houses it was modeled on, the White House was, from the start, open to the public until the early part of the 20th century President Thomas Jefferson held an open house for his second inaugural in 1805, and many of the people at his swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol followed him home, where he greeted them in the Blue Room Those open houses sometimes became rowdy: in 1829, President Andrew Jackson had to leave for a hotel when roughly 20,000 citizens celebrated his inauguration inside the White House His aides ultimately had to lure the mob outside with washtubs filled with a potent cocktail of orange juice and whiskey [101]\n\n\nHistorical accessibility\nLike the English and Irish country houses it was modeled on, the White House was, from the start, open to the public until the early part of the 20th century

without authorization on the White House's grounds [103] Twenty years later, in 1994, a stolen light plane flown by Frank Eugene Corder crashed on White House grounds, instantly killing him [104]\n\n\nClosure of Pennsylvania Avenue\nOn May 20, 1995, primarily as a response to the Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, the United States Secret Service closed off Pennsylvania Avenue to vehicular traffic in front of the White House, from the eastern edge of Lafayette Park to 17th Street Later, the closure was extended an additional block to the east to 15th Street, and East Executive Avenue, a small street between the White House and the Treasury Building.\n\n\nProtection\nThe White House Complex is protected by the United States Secret Service and the United States Park Police.\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "The White House\n\nThe White House, also known as the Executive

Rosalynn Carter, in 1977, was the first to place her personal office in the East Wing and to formally call it the \"Office of the First Lady.\" The East Wing was built during World War II in order to hide the construction of an underground bunker to be used in emergencies. The bunker has come to be known as the Presidential Emergency Operations Center.\n\nGrounds\n\nThe White House and grounds cover just over 18 acres. Before the construction of the North Portico, most public events were entered from the South Lawn, the grading and planting of which was ordered by Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson also drafted a planting plan for the North Lawn that included large trees that would have mostly obscured the house from Pennsylvania Avenue. During the mid-to-late 19th century, a series of ever larger greenhouses were built on the west side of the house, where the current West Wing is located. During this period, the North Lawn was planted with ornate carpet-style flowerbeds.\n\nPublic Access and Security\n\nLike the English and Irish country houses it was modeled on, the White House was, from the start, open to the public until the early part of the 20th century. President Thomas Jefferson held an open house for his second inaugural in 1805, and many of the people at his swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol followed him home, where he greeted them in the Blue Room. Those open houses sometimes became rowdy: in 1829, President Andrew Jackson had to leave for a hotel when roughly 20,000 citizens celebrated his inauguration inside the White House. His aides ultimately had to lure the mob outside with washtubs filled with a potent cocktail of orange juice and whiskey.\n\nAviation Incidents\n\nIn February 1974, a stolen U.S Army helicopter landed without authorization on the White House's grounds. Twenty years later, in 1994, a stolen light plane flown by Frank Eugene Corder crashed on White House grounds, instantly killing him.\n\nClosure of Pennsylvania Avenue\n\nOn May 20, 1995, primarily as a response to the Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, the United States Secret Service closed off Pennsylvania Avenue to vehicular traffic in front of the White House, from the eastern edge of Lafayette Park to 17th Street. Later, the closure was extended an additional block to the east to 15th Street, and East Executive Avenue, a small street between the White House and the Treasury Building.\n\nProtection\n\nThe White House Complex is protected by the United States Secret Service and the United States Park Police.\n\nGallery\n\nSee Also\n\n* List of White House tours\n* History of the White House\n* White House

outline:\n\n\nEarly history\nFollowing his April 1789 inauguration, President George Washington occupied two private houses in New York City, which served as the executive mansion He lived at the first, the Walter Franklin House, which was owned by Treasury Commissioner Samuel Osgood, at 3 Cherry Street, through late February 1790 [7] [8]  The executive mansion moved to the larger quarters at Alexander Macomb House at 39–41 Broadway, [8] where Washington stayed with his wife Martha and a small staff until August 1790 In May 1790, construction began on a new official residence in Manhattan called Government House.\n\n\n1789–1800\nFollowing his April 1789 inauguration, President George Washington occupied two private houses in New York City, which served as the executive mansion He lived at the first, the Walter Franklin House, which was owned by Treasury Commissioner Samuel Osgood, at 3 Cherry Street, through late February 1790 [7] [8]  The executive mansion moved to the larger quarters at Alexander Macomb House at 39–41 Broadway, [8] where Washington stayed with his wife Martha and a small staff until August 1790 In May 1790, construction began on a new official residence in Manhattan called Government House.\n\n\nArchitectural competition\nThe President's House was a major feature of Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant's [a] 1791 plan for the newly established federal city of Washington, D.C [15] After L'Enfant's dismissal in early 1792, Washington and his Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, who both had personal interests in architecture, agreed that the design of the President's House and the Capitol would be chosen in a design competition [16]\n\n\nDesign influences\nThe Neoclassical design of the White House is based primarily on architectural concepts inherited from the Roman architect Vitruvius and the Venetian architect Andrea Palladio The design of the upper floors also includes elements based on Dublin's Leinster House, which later became the seat of the Irish parliament (Oireachtas) [20] The upper windows with alternate triangular and segmented pediments are inspired by the Irish building [21] Additionally, several Georgian-era Irish country houses have been suggested as sources of inspiration for the overall floor plan, including the bow-fronted south front and the former niches in the present-day Blue Room.\n\n\nConstruction\nConstruction of the White House began at noon on October 13, 1792, with the laying of the cornerstone [24] [25] The main residence and foundations of the house were built largely by both enslaved and free African-American laborers, and employed Europeans [26] Much of the other work on the house was done by immigrants, many of whom had not yet obtained citizenship, including the sandstone walls, which were erected by Scottish immigrants [27], the high-relief rose, and garland decorations above the north entrance and the fish scale pattern beneath the pediments of the window hoods.\n\n\nArchitectural description\nThe main entrance is located on the north façade under a porte cochere with Ionic columns [32] The ground floor is hidden by a raised carriage ramp and parapet The central three bays are situated behind a prostyle portico that was added c. 1830 The windows of the four bays flanking the portico, at first-floor level, have alternating pointed and segmented pediments, while the second-floor pediments are flat A lunette fanlight and a sculpted floral festoon surmount the entrance The roofline is hidden by a balustraded parapet.\n\n\nNaming conventions\nThe building was originally variously referred to as the President's Palace, Presidential Mansion, or President's House [34] The earliest evidence of the public calling it the \"White House\" was recorded in 1811 [35] A myth emerged that during the rebuilding of the structure after the Burning of Washington, white paint was applied to mask the burn damage it had suffered, [36] giving the building its namesake hue [37] The name \"Executive Mansion\" was used in official contexts until President Theodore Roosevelt established \"The White House\" as its formal name in 1901 via Executive Order [38] The current letterhead wording and arrangement of \"The White House\" with the word \"Washington\" centered beneath it dates to the administration of Franklin D Roosevelt [39]\n\n\nEvolution of the White House\nOn Saturday, November 1, 1800, John Adams became the first president to take residence in the building [27] The next day he wrote his wife Abigail:\n\"I pray Heaven to bestow the best of blessings on this House, and all that shall hereafter inhabit it May none but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof.\" [41]\nPresident Franklin D Roosevelt had Adams's blessing carved into the mantel in the State Dining Room [41]\n\n\nEarly use, 1814 burning, and reconstruction\nOn Saturday, November 1, 1800, John Adams became the first president to take residence in the building [27] The next day he wrote his wife Abigail:\n\"I pray Heaven to bestow the best of blessings on this House, and all that shall hereafter inhabit it May none but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof.\" [41]\nPresident Franklin D Roosevelt had Adams's blessing carved into the mantel in the State Dining Room [41]\n\n\nOvercrowding and building the West Wing\nBy the time of the American Civil War, the White House had become overcrowded The location of the White House, just north of a canal and swampy lands, which provided conditions ripe for malaria and other unhealthy conditions, was questioned [55] Brigadier General Nathaniel Michler was tasked with proposing solutions to address these concerns He proposed abandoning the use of the White House as a residence, and he designed a new estate for the first family at Meridian Hill in Washington, D.C Congress, however, rejected the plan [55] Another option was Metropolis View, which is now the campus of The Catholic University of America [56]\n\n\nTruman reconstruction\nDecades of poor maintenance, the construction of a fourth-story attic during the Coolidge administration, and the addition of a second-floor balcony over the south portico for Harry S Truman [65] took a great toll on the brick and sandstone structure built around a timber frame [27] By 1948, the house was declared to be in imminent danger of collapse, forcing President Truman to commission a reconstruction and to live across the street at Blair House from 1949 to 1951 [66]\n\n\nJacqueline Kennedy restoration\nJacqueline Kennedy, wife of President John F Kennedy (1961–63), directed a very extensive and historic redecoration of the house She enlisted the help of Henry Francis du Pont of the Winterthur Museum to assist in collecting artifacts for the mansion, many of which had once been housed there [69] Other antiques, fine paintings, and improvements from the Kennedy period were donated to the White House by wealthy philanthropists, including the Crowninshield family, Jane Engelhard, Jayne Wrightsman, and the Oppenheimer family.\n\n\nThe White House since the Kennedy restoration\nCongress enacted legislation in September 1961 declaring the White House a museum Furniture, fixtures, and decorative arts could now be declared either historic or of artistic interest by the president This prevented them from being sold (as many objects in the executive mansion had been in the past 150 years) When not in use or display at the White House, these items were to be turned over to the Smithsonian Institution for preservation, study, storage, or exhibition The White House retains the right to have these items returned [63]: 29 \n\n\nLayout and amenities\nThe current group of buildings housing the presidency is known as the White House Complex It includes the central Executive Residence flanked by the East Wing and West Wing The chief usher coordinates day to day household operations The White House includes six stories and 55,000 square feet (5,100 m2) of floor space, 132 rooms and 35 bathrooms, 412 doors, 147 windows, 28 fireplaces, eight staircases, three elevators, five full-time chefs, a tennis court, a (single-lane) bowling alley, a movie theater (officially called the White House Family Theater [86]), a jogging track, a swimming pool, and a putting green [39] It receives up to 30,000 visitors each week [87]\n\n\nExecutive Residence\nThe original residence is in the center Two colonnades – one on the east and one on the west – designed by Jefferson, now serve to connect the East and West Wings added later The Executive Residence houses the president's dwelling, as well as rooms for ceremonies and official entertaining The State Floor of the residence building includes the East Room, Green Room, Blue Room, Red Room, State Dining Room, Family Dining Room, Cross Hall, Entrance Hall, and Grand Staircase [88] The Ground Floor is made up of the Diplomatic Reception Room, Map Room, China Room, Vermeil Room, Library, the main kitchen, and other offices [89]\n\n\nWest Wing\nThe West Wing houses the president's office (the Oval Office) and offices of his senior staff, with room for about 50 employees It includes the Cabinet Room, where the president conducts business meetings and where the Cabinet meets, [92] as well as the White House Situation Room, James S Brady Press Briefing Room, and the Roosevelt Room [93] In 2007, work was completed on renovations of the press briefing room, adding fiber optic cables and LCD screens for the display of charts and graphs [94] The makeover took 11 months and cost of $8 million, of which news outlets paid $2 million [94] In September 2010, a two-year project began on the West Wing, creating a multistory underground structure [95]\n\n\nEast Wing\nThe East Wing, which contains additional office space, was added to the White House in 1942 Among its uses, the East Wing has intermittently housed the offices and staff of the first lady and the White House Social Office Rosalynn Carter, in 1977, was the first to place her personal office in the East Wing and to formally call it the

the NBA.\n\n\nCombine\nThe invitation-only NBA Draft Combine was held in Chicago from May 16 to 20 The on-court element of the combine took place on May 18 and 19 A total of 69 players were invited to the NBA Draft this year, with two top talents in Deandre Ayton and Luka Dončić declining invitations for the event that year, with the latter player being involved with the 2018 EuroLeague Final Four at the time [61] Both mystery man Mitchell Robinson and Chandler Hutchison would remove themselves from the event at the last minute, although two other players would enter the event instead of them, leaving the proper number of official participants at 69 [62] At the end of the draft deadline for international players, 12 players that entered the NBA Draft Combine that year ultimately withdrew from the NBA Draft, with 11 players returning to college and Brian Bowen planning on playing professionally before trying another NBA draft instead.\n\n\nDraft lottery\nThe NBA draft lottery took place during the playoffs on May 15, 2018 This year will be the last time it uses what was originally the updated system for the NBA draft lottery to upgrade draft odds for teams in the lower regions of the NBA Starting in 2019 onward, the newer updated draft lottery will give the bottom 3 teams equal odds for the No 1 pick, while some of the teams higher up the NBA draft would get an increased chance for a top-four pick instead of a top-three pick like in this year, thus hoping to discourage teams from potentially losing games on purpose for higher draft picks (and potentially better talent in the process) There were also two tiebreakers involved for lottery odds this season; the first involved the Dallas Mavericks having one more result favoring them having the No 1 pick over the Atlanta Hawks after splitting the odds together, while the second tiebreaker had the Chicago Bulls splitting odds with the Sacramento Kings, resulting in the Bulls having slightly better odds on their end in the process Funnily enough, both of the teams mentioned that lost the tiebreakers would wind up being in the Top 3 at the end of the NBA draft lottery Furthermore, the Hawks would trade their Top 3 selection to Dallas for their selection in the draft instead.\n\n\nEligibility and entrants\nThe draft is conducted under the eligibility rules established in the league's 2017 collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with its players' union The previous CBA that ended the 2011 lockout instituted no immediate changes to the draft but called for a committee of owners and players to discuss future changes.\n\n\nEarly entrants\nPlayers who are not automatically eligible have to declare their eligibility for the draft by notifying the NBA offices in writing no later than 60 days before the draft For the 2018 draft, the date fell on April 22 After that date, \"early entry\" players can attend NBA pre-draft camps and individual team workouts to show off their skills and obtain feedback regarding their draft positions Under the CBA a player may withdraw his name from consideration from the draft at any time before the final declaration date, which is 10 days before the draft Under current NCAA rules, players had until May 30 (10 days after the draft combine) to withdraw from the draft and retain college eligibility.\n\n\nCollege underclassmen\nA record-high 236 underclassed draft prospects (i.e., players with remaining college eligibility) had declared by the April 22 deadline, with 181 of these players being from college [65] The names listed here mean that they hired an agent, or had announced that they planned to do so before the night of the draft At the end of the deadline, 77 players declared their intentions to enter the draft with an agent (with one player announcing his entry after the deadline) while 100 players announced their return to college for at least one more season [66] Meanwhile, Matur Maker, Brian Bowen, Micah Seaborn and Tavarius Shine did not enter the draft after letting their deadlines to retain college eligibility expire These players instead decided to enter in 2019 via either the NBA G League or another professional league [67]\n\n\nInternational players\nInternational players that had declared this year and did not previously declare in another prior year can drop out of the draft about 10 days before the draft begins on June 11 Initially, there were 55 players who originally expressed interest in entering the 2018 draft, one of which was a player who came directly out of high school from Canada However, by the end of the deadline, 43 of those players (including the aforementioned Canadian high schooler) would ultimately pull their names out of the draft, leaving only 11 true international players entering the NBA Draft this year (the NBA link mentions LiAngelo Ball as an international player in the loosest sense of the word, but not Billy Preston there) [68] Combining both the number of players listed previously and both LiAngelo Ball and Billy Preston as automatically eligible underclassmen under unique situations, the total number of underclassmen rounds out to 90 overall players.\n\n\nAutomatically eligible entrants\nPlayers who do not meet the criteria for \"international\" players are automatically eligible if they meet any of the following criteria: [69]\n\n\nTrades involving draft picks\nBefore the day of the draft, the following trades were made and resulted in exchanges of draft picks between the teams below.\n\n\nPre-draft trades\nBefore the day of the draft, the following trades were made and resulted in exchanges of draft picks between the teams below.\n\n\nDraft-day trades\nDraft-day trades occurred on June 21, 2018, the day of the draft.\n\n\nInvited attendees\nThe NBA annually invites around 15–20 players to sit in the so-called \"green room\", a special room set aside at the draft site for the invited players plus their families and agents When their names are called, the player leaves the room and goes up on stage Other players who are not invited are allowed to attend the ceremony They sit in the stands with the fans and walk up on stage when (or if) they are drafted [71] On June 15, 2018, 19 total players were announced as invites for the NBA Draft that year (all of whom coming out of college this year), while potential top 3 pick Luka Dončić was initially not invited to the event due to the Liga ACB Finals potentially extending through the draft On June 19, ESPN reported that Dončić would attend the draft, after all, following Real Madrid's championship victory the previous night, extending the list to 20 players [72] The following players (listed alphabetically) were confirmed as invites for the event this year:\n\n\nNotes\n1961\n\n\nSee also\n1961\n\n\nReferences\n1961\n\n\nExternal links\n1961\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "The 2018 NBA draft was held on June 21, 2018, at the Barclays

lottery will give the bottom 3 teams equal odds for the No 1 pick, while some of the teams higher up the NBA draft would get an increased chance for a top-four pick instead of a top-three pick like in this year, thus hoping to discourage teams from potentially losing games on purpose for higher draft picks (and potentially better talent in the process) There were also two tiebreakers involved for lottery odds this season; the first involved the Dallas Mavericks having one more result favoring them having the No 1 pick over the Atlanta Hawks after splitting the odds together, while the second tiebreaker had the Chicago Bulls splitting odds with the Sacramento Kings, resulting in the Bulls having slightly better odds on their end in the process Funnily enough, both of the teams mentioned that lost the tiebreakers would wind up being in the Top 3 at the end of the NBA draft lottery Furthermore, the Hawks would trade their Top 3 selection to Dallas for their selection in the draft instead.\n\n\nEligibility and entrants\nThe draft is conducted under the eligibility rules established in the league's 2017 collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with its players' union The previous CBA that ended the 2011 lockout instituted no immediate changes to the draft but called for a committee of owners and players to discuss future changes.\n\n\nEarly entrants\nPlayers who are not automatically eligible have to declare their eligibility for the draft by notifying the NBA offices in writing no later than 60 days before the draft For the 2018 draft, the date fell on April 22 After that date, \"early entry\" players can attend NBA pre-draft camps and individual team workouts to show off their skills and obtain feedback regarding their draft positions Under the CBA a player may withdraw his name from consideration from the draft at any time before the final declaration date, which is 10 days before the draft Under current NCAA rules, players had until May 30 (10 days after the draft combine) to withdraw from the draft and retain college eligibility.\n\n\nCollege underclassmen\nA record-high 236 underclassed draft prospects (i.e., players with remaining college eligibility) had declared by the April 22 deadline, with 181 of these players being from college [65] The names listed here mean that they hired an agent, or had announced that they planned to do so before the night of the draft At the end of the deadline, 77 players declared their intentions to enter the draft with an agent (with one player announcing his entry after the deadline) while 100 players announced their return to college for at least one more season [66] Meanwhile, Matur Maker, Brian Bowen, Micah Seaborn and Tavarius Shine did not enter the draft after letting their deadlines to retain college eligibility expire These players instead decided to enter in 2019 via either the NBA G League or another professional league [67]\n\n\nInternational players\nInternational players that had declared this year and did not previously declare in another prior year can drop out of the draft about 10 days before the draft begins on June 11 Initially, there were 55 players who originally expressed interest in entering the 2018 draft, one of which was a player who came directly out of high school from Canada However, by the end of the deadline, 43 of those players (including the aforementioned Canadian high schooler) would ultimately pull their names out of the draft, leaving only 11 true international players entering the NBA Draft this year (the NBA link mentions LiAngelo Ball as an international player in the loosest sense of the word, but not Billy Preston there) [68] Combining both the number of players listed previously and both LiAngelo Ball and Billy Preston as automatically eligible underclassmen under unique situations, the total number of underclassmen rounds out to 90 overall players.\n\n\nAutomatically eligible entrants\nPlayers who do not meet the criteria for \"international\" players are automatically eligible if they meet any of the following criteria: [69]\n\n\nTrades involving draft picks\nBefore the day of the draft, the following trades were made and resulted in exchanges of draft picks between the teams below.\n\n\nPre-draft trades\nBefore the day of the draft, the following trades were made and resulted in exchanges of draft picks between the teams below.\n\n\nDraft-day trades\nDraft-day trades occurred on June 21, 2018, the day of the draft.\n\n\nInvited attendees\nThe NBA annually invites around 15–20 players to sit in the so-called \"green room\", a special room set aside at the draft site for the invited players plus their families and agents When their names are called, the player leaves the room and goes up on stage Other players who are not invited are allowed to attend the ceremony They sit in the stands with the fans and walk up on stage when (or if) they are drafted [71] On June 15, 2018, 19 total players were announced as invites for the NBA Draft that year (all of whom coming out of college this year), while potential top 3 pick Luka Dončić was initially not invited to the event due to the Liga ACB Finals potentially extending through the draft On June 19, ESPN reported that Dončić would attend the draft, after all, following Real Madrid's championship victory the previous night, extending the list to 20 players [72] The following players (listed alphabetically) were confirmed as invites for the event this year:\n\n\nNotes\n1961\n\n\nSee

His work has had a profound impact on the scientific community and has led to a global effort to reduce the use of CFCs and protect the ozone layer.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nMario Molina was born in Mexico City to Roberto Molina Pasqual and Leonor Henriquez. His father was a lawyer and diplomat who served as an ambassador to Eritrea, Australia, and the Philippines. Molina's mother was a family manager and had a strong influence on his early life. Molina's parents were from different backgrounds, which may have contributed to his desire to pursue a career in science. He has mentioned that he was drawn to science because it was a field that allowed him to be objective and focused on the truth.\n\n**Career**\n\nMolina began his studies at the University of California at Berkeley in 1968, where he would obtain his PhD in physical chemistry. During his time at Berkeley, he participated in various research projects, including the study of molecular dynamics using chemical lasers and the investigation of the distribution of internal energy in the products of chemical and photochemical reactions. Molina worked closely with his professor and mentor, George C. Pimentel, who had a significant impact on his love for chemistry.\n\nAfter completing his PhD in physical chemistry in 1973, Molina enrolled in a research program at UC Berkeley with Sherwood Rowland. The topic of interest was the study of CFCs, which would later become the focus of Molina's groundbreaking research. Molina and Rowland's work on CFCs laid the foundation for the discovery of the role of CFCs in ozone depletion.\n\n**Work on CFCs**\n\nMolina joined the lab of Professor F. Sherwood Rowland in 1973 as a postdoctoral fellow. During this time, Molina continued Rowland's pioneering research into \"hot atom\" chemistry, which is the study of chemical properties of atoms with excess translational energy owing to radioactive processes. Molina's work on CFCs was a key component of this research, and he made significant contributions to the understanding of the chemistry of CFCs.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Molina and Rowland began to study the effects of CFCs on the ozone layer. They discovered that CFCs were being released into the atmosphere and reacting with ozone molecules, leading to the depletion of the ozone layer. This discovery was groundbreaking and had significant implications for the scientific community.\n\n**Honors**\n\nMolina received numerous awards and honors for his work on CFCs and ozone depletion. In 1995, he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Paul J. Crutzen and F. Sherwood Rowland for their discovery of the role of CFCs in ozone depletion. Molina has also received over 30 honorary degrees from universities around the world.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nMolina married his first wife, Luisa Y. Tan, in July 1973. The couple met while Molina was pursuing his PhD at the University of California, Berkeley. They moved to Irvine, California in the fall of 1973 and had a son, Felipe Jose Molina, in 1977. The couple divorced in 2005. Molina married his second wife, Guadalupe Álvarez, in February 2006.\n\n**Works**\n\nMolina has published numerous papers on the topic of CFCs and ozone depletion. Some of his notable works include:\n\n* \"Chlorofluoromethanes in the Atmosphere\" (1974)\n* \"The Nitrogen Oxides in the Stratosphere\" (1975)\n* \"The Role of CFCs in Ozone Depletion\" (1980)\n\n**Notes**\n\nMolina's work on CFCs and ozone depletion has had a significant impact on the scientific community and has led to a global effort to reduce the use of CFCs and protect the ozone layer. His research has also raised awareness about the importance of protecting the environment and has inspired a new generation of scientists to pursue careers in environmental science.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Mario Molina's Nobel Prize page\n* Mario Molina's biography on the University of California, Berkeley website\n* The Mario Molina Center for Strategic Studies in Energy and the Environment", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mario_Molina\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nMolina was born in Mexico City to Roberto Molina Pasqual and Leonor Henriquez His father was a lawyer and diplomat who served as an ambassador to Eritrea, Australia and the Philippines [12] His mother was a family manager With considerably different interests than his parents, Mario Molina went on to make one of the biggest discoveries in environmental science.\n\n\nCareer\nMario Molina began his studies at the University of California at Berkeley in 1968, where he would obtain his PhD in physical chemistry Throughout his years at Berkeley, he participated in various research projects such as the study of molecular dynamics using chemical lasers and investigation of the distribution of internal energy in the products of chemical and photochemical reactions [13] Throughout this journey is where he worked with his professor and mentor George C Pimentel who grew his love for chemistry even further [13] After completing his PhD in physical chemistry, in 1973, he enrolled in a research program at UC Berkeley, with Sherwood Rowland The topic of interest was Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)  The two would later on make one of the largest discoveries in atmospheric chemistry They developed their theory of ozone depletion, which later influenced the mass public to reduce their use of CFCs This kickstarted his career as a widely known chemist.\n\n\nWork on CFCs\nMolina joined the lab of Professor F Sherwood Rowland in 1973 as a postdoctoral fellow Here, Molina continued Rowland's pioneering research into \"hot atom\" chemistry, which is the study of chemical properties of atoms with excess translational energy owing to radioactive processes [32] [33]\n\n\nHonors\nMolina received numerous awards and honors, [5] [6] including sharing the 1995 Nobel Prize in chemistry with Paul J Crutzen and F Sherwood Rowland for their discovery of the role of CFCs in ozone depletion [1]\n\n\nHonorary degrees\nMolina received more than thirty honorary degrees [5]\n\n\nPersonal life\nMolina married fellow chemist Luisa Y Tan in July 1973 They met each other when Molina was pursuing his PhD at the University of California, Berkeley They moved to Irvine, California in the fall of that year [68] The couple divorced in 2005 [40] Luisa Tan Molina is now the lead scientist of the Molina Center for Strategic Studies in Energy and the Environment in La Jolla, California [69] Their son, Felipe Jose Molina, was born in 1977 [13] [70] Molina married his second wife, Guadalupe Álvarez, in February 2006 [13]\n\n\nWorks\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Origins\nSignal is the successor of the RedPhone encrypted voice calling app and the TextSecure encrypted texting program The beta versions of RedPhone and TextSecure were first launched in May 2010 by Whisper Systems, [54] a startup company co-founded by security researcher Moxie Marlinspike and roboticist Stuart Anderson [55] [56] Whisper Systems also produced a firewall and tools for encrypting other forms of data [55] [57] All of these were proprietary enterprise mobile security software and were only available for Android.\n\n\n2013–2018: Open Whisper Systems\nOpen Whisper Systems' website was launched in January 2013 [66]\n\n\nSince 2018: Signal Technology Foundation\nOn 21 February 2018, Moxie Marlinspike and WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton announced the formation of the Signal Technology Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization whose mission is \"to support, accelerate, and broaden Signal's mission of making private communication accessible and ubiquitous\" [87] [26] Acton started the foundation with $50 million in funding and became the foundation's executive chairman after leaving WhatsApp's parent company Facebook in September 2017 [26] Marlinspike continued as Signal Messenger's first CEO [87] As of 2020 [update], Signal ran entirely on donations, as a nonprofit [88]\n\n\nUsage\nSignal's userbase started in May 2010, when its predecessor TextSecure was launched by Whisper Systems [54] According to App Annie, Signal had approximately 20 million monthly active users at the end of December 2020 [108] In January 2022, the BBC reported that Signal was used by over 40 million people [109]\n\n\nDevelopers and funding\nThe development of Signal and its predecessors at Open Whisper Systems was funded by a combination of consulting contracts, donations and grants [110] The Freedom of the Press Foundation acted as Signal's fiscal sponsor [87] [111] [112] Between 2013 and 2016, the project received grants from the Knight Foundation, [113] the Shuttleworth Foundation, [114] and almost $3 million from the US government–sponsored Open Technology Fund [115] Signal is now developed by Signal Messenger LLC, a software company founded by Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton in 2018, which is wholly owned by a tax-exempt nonprofit corporation called the Signal Technology Foundation, also created by them in 2018 The Foundation was funded with an initial loan of $50 million from Acton, \"to support, accelerate, and broaden Signal's mission of making private communication accessible and ubiquitous\" [87] [26] [116] All of the organization's products are published as free and open-source software.\n\n\nFeatures\nSignal provides one-to-one and group [118] voice and video [14] calls with up to forty participants on iOS, Android, and desktop platforms [119] [120] The calls are carried via the devices' wired or wireless (carrier or WiFi) data connections [69] The application can send text messages, documents files, [16] voice notes, pictures, stickers, GIFs, [121] and video messages The platform also supports group messaging.\n\n\nLimitations\nSignal requires that the user provide a telephone number for verification, [139] eliminating the need for user names or passwords and facilitating contact discovery (see below) [140] The number does not have to be the same as on the device's SIM card; it can also be a VoIP number [139] or a landline as long as the user can receive the verification code and have a separate device to set up the software A number can only be registered on one mobile device at a time [141] Account registration requires an iOS or Android device [20] [21]\n\n\nUsability\nIn July 2016, the Internet Society published a user study that assessed the ability of Signal users to detect and deter man-in-the-middle attacks [25] The study concluded that 21 out of 28 participants failed to correctly compare public key fingerprints in order to verify the identity of other Signal users, and that most of these users believed they had succeeded, while they had actually failed [25] Four months later, Signal's user interface was updated to make verifying the identity of other Signal users simpler [147]\n\n\nArchitecture\nSignal messages are encrypted with the Signal Protocol (formerly known as the TextSecure Protocol) The protocol combines the Double Ratchet Algorithm, prekeys, and an Extended Triple Diffie–Hellman (X3DH) handshake [149] [150] It uses Curve25519, AES-256, and HMAC-SHA256 as primitives [23] The protocol provides confidentiality, integrity, authentication, participant consistency, destination validation, forward secrecy, backward secrecy (a.k.a future secrecy), causality preservation, message unlinkability, message repudiation, participation repudiation, and asynchronicity [151] It does not provide anonymity preservation, and requires servers for the relaying of messages and storing of public key material [151]\n\n\nEncryption protocols\nSignal messages are encrypted with the Signal Protocol (formerly known as the TextSecure Protocol) The protocol combines the Double Ratchet Algorithm, prekeys, and an Extended Triple Diffie–Hellman (X3DH) handshake [149] [150] It uses Curve25519, AES-256, and HMAC-SHA256 as primitives [23] The protocol provides confidentiality, integrity, authentication, participant consistency, destination validation, forward secrecy, backward secrecy (a.k.a future secrecy), causality preservation, message unlinkability, message repudiation, participation repudiation, and asynchronicity [151] It does not provide anonymity preservation, and requires servers for the relaying of messages and storing of public key material [151]\n\n\nAuthentication\nTo verify that a correspondent is really the person that they claim to be, Signal users can compare key fingerprints (or scan QR codes) out-of-band [123] The platform employs a trust on first use mechanism in order to notify the user if a correspondent's key changes [123]\n\n\nLocal storage\nAfter receiving and decrypting messages, the application stored them locally on each device in a SQLite database that is encrypted with SQLCipher [163] The cryptographic key for this database is also stored locally and can be accessed if the device is unlocked [163] [164] In December 2020, Cellebrite published a blog post announcing that one of their products could now access this key and use it to \"decrypt the Signal app\" [163] [165] Technology reporters later published articles about how Cellebrite had claimed to have the ability to \"break into the Signal app\" and \"crack Signal's encryption\" [166] [167] This latter interpretation was rejected by several experts, [168] as well as representatives from Signal, who said the original post by Cellebrite had been about accessing data on \"an unlocked Android phone in their physical possession\" and that they \"could have just opened the app to look at the messages\" [169] [170] Similar extraction tools also exist for iOS devices and Signal Desktop [171] [172]\n\n\nServers\nSignal relies on centralized servers that are maintained by Signal Messenger In addition to routing Signal's messages, the servers also facilitate the discovery of contacts who are also registered Signal users and the automatic exchange of users' public keys By default, Signal's voice and video calls are peer-to-peer [14] If the caller is not in the receiver's address book, the call is routed through a server in order to hide the users' IP addresses [14]\n\n\nContact discovery\nThe servers store registered users' phone numbers, public key material and push tokens which are necessary for setting up calls and transmitting messages [173] In order to determine which contacts are also Signal users, cryptographic hashes of the user's contact numbers are periodically transmitted to the server [174] The server then checks to see if those match any of the SHA256 hashes of registered users and tells the client if any matches are found [174] The hashed numbers are thereafter discarded from the server [173] In 2014, Moxie Marlinspike wrote that it is easy to calculate a map of all possible hash inputs to hash outputs and reverse the mapping because of the limited preimage space (the set of all possible hash inputs) of phone numbers, and that a \"practical privacy preserving contact discovery remains an unsolved problem.\" [175] [174] In September 2017, Signal's developers announced that they were working on a way for the Signal client applications to \"efficiently and scalably determine whether the contacts in their address book are Signal users without revealing the contacts in their address book to the Signal service.\" [176] [177]\n\n\nMetadata\nAll client-server communications are protected by TLS [161] [178] Signal's developers have asserted that their servers do not keep logs about who called whom and when [179] In June 2016, Marlinspike told The Intercept that \"the closest piece of information to metadata that the Signal server stores is the last time each user connected to the server, and the precision of this information is reduced to the day, rather than the hour, minute, and second\" [132]\n\n\nFederation\nSignal's server architecture was federated between December 2013 and February 2016 In December 2013, it was announced that the messaging protocol Signal uses had successfully been integrated into the Android-based open-source operating system CyanogenMod [182] [183] [184] Since CyanogenMod 11.0, the client logic was contained in a system app called WhisperPush According to Signal's developers, the Cyanogen team ran their own Signal messaging server for WhisperPush clients, which federated with the main server, so that both clients could exchange messages with each other [184] The WhisperPush source code was available under the GPLv3 license [185] In February 2016, the CyanogenMod team discontinued WhisperPush and recommended that its users switch to Signal [186] In May 2016, Moxie Marlinspike wrote that federation with the CyanogenMod servers had degraded the user experience and held back development, and that their servers will probably not federate with other servers again [187]\n\n\nLicensing\nThe complete source code of the Signal clients for Android, iOS and desktop is available on GitHub under a free software license [11] [10] [12] This enables interested parties to examine the code and help the developers verify that everything is behaving as expected It also allows advanced users to compile their own copies of the applications and compare them with the versions that are distributed by Signal Messenger In March 2016, Moxie Marlinspike wrote that, apart from some shared libraries that are not compiled with the project build due to a lack of Gradle NDK support, Signal for Android is reproducible [190] Signal's servers are partially open source, but the server software's anti-spam component is proprietary and closed source due to security concerns [13] [191]\n\n\nReception\nIn October 2014, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) included Signal in their updated surveillance self-defense guide [192] In November 2014, Signal received a perfect score on the EFF's secure messaging scorecard; [122] it received points for having communications encrypted in transit, having communications encrypted with keys the provider does not have access to (end-to-end encryption), making it possible for users to independently verify their correspondents' identities, having past communications secure if the keys are stolen (forward secrecy), having the code open to independent review (open source), having the security designs well-documented, and having a recent independent security audit [122] At the time, \"ChatSecure + Orbot\", Pidgin (with OTR), Silent Phone, and Telegram's optional \"secret chats\" also received seven out of seven points on the scorecard [122]\n\n\nSecurity\nIn October 2014, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) included Signal in their updated surveillance self-defense guide [192] In November

Signal announced the addition of a cryptocurrency wallet feature that would allow users to send and receive payments in MobileCoin [213] This received criticism from security expert Bruce Schneier, who had previously praised the software Schneier stated that this would bloat the client and attract unwanted attention from the authorities [214] The wallet functionality was initially only available in certain countries, but was later enabled globally in November 2021 [136]\n\n\nBlocking\nIn December 2016, Egypt blocked access to Signal [215] In response, Signal's developers added domain fronting to their service [216] This allows Signal users in a specific country to circumvent censorship by making it look like they are connecting to a different internet-based service [216] [217] As of May 2022 [update], Signal's domain fronting is enabled by default in Egypt, UAE, Oman, Qatar, Iran, Cuba, Uzbekistan and Ukraine [218]\n\n\nAudience\nIn 2020, the app was used for coordination and communication by protesters during the George Floyd protests as they relied on the app's end-to-end encryption to share information securely [232]\n\n\nUse by activists\nIn 2020, the app was used for

It offers a range of features, including encrypted voice and video calls, group chats, file sharing, and more. Signal is available on iOS, Android, and desktop platforms, and has gained a large user base due to its emphasis on security and privacy.\n\n# History\n\nSignal was first developed in 2010 by Whisper Systems, a startup company co-founded by security researcher Moxie Marlinspike and roboticist Stuart Anderson. Whisper Systems also produced other security-related software, including a firewall and tools for encrypting data. In 2013, Whisper Systems was rebranded as Open Whisper Systems, and the company's website was launched in January of that year.\n\n## 2010-2013: Origins\n\nSignal is the successor to the RedPhone encrypted voice calling app and the TextSecure encrypted texting program. The beta versions of RedPhone and TextSecure were first launched in May 2010 by Whisper Systems. These early versions were proprietary enterprise mobile security software and were only available for Android.\n\n## 2013-2018: Open Whisper Systems\n\nIn 2013, Open Whisper Systems launched its website, marking a significant milestone for the company. During this period, the company continued to develop and refine its encryption protocols, laying the foundation for the secure messaging app that would become Signal.\n\n## 2018-Present: Signal Technology Foundation\n\nIn February 2018, Moxie Marlinspike and WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton announced the formation of the Signal Technology Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting and accelerating Signal's mission. The foundation was funded with an initial loan of $50 million from Acton, and its mission is to make private communication accessible and ubiquitous.\n\n# Usage\n\nSignal's user base started in May 2010, when its predecessor TextSecure was launched by Whisper Systems. According to App Annie, Signal had approximately 20 million monthly active users at the end of December 2020. In January 2022, the BBC reported that Signal was used by over 40 million people.\n\n# Developers and Funding\n\nThe development of Signal and its predecessors at Open Whisper Systems was funded by a combination of consulting contracts, donations, and grants. The Freedom of the Press Foundation acted as Signal's fiscal sponsor, and the project received grants from the Knight Foundation, the Shuttleworth Foundation, and the US government-sponsored Open Technology Fund.\n\n# Features\n\nSignal provides a range of features, including:\n\n* One-to-one and group voice and video calls with up to 40 participants\n* Group messaging\n* Text messaging\n* Document and file sharing\n* Voice notes\n* Pictures and stickers\n* GIFs\n* Video messages\n\n# Limitations\n\nSignal requires users to provide a telephone number for verification, which can be a VoIP number or a landline as long as the user can receive the verification code and has a separate device to set up the software. A number can only be registered on one mobile device at a time. Account registration requires an iOS or Android device.\n\n# Usability\n\nIn 2016, the Internet Society published a user study that assessed the ability of Signal users to detect and deter man-in-the-middle attacks. The study concluded that 21 out of 28 participants failed to correctly compare public key fingerprints in order to verify the identity of other Signal users. In response, Signal updated its user interface to make verifying the identity of other Signal users simpler.\n\n# Architecture\n\nSignal messages are encrypted with the Signal Protocol, which combines the Double Ratchet Algorithm, prekeys, and an Extended Triple Diffie-Hellman handshake. The protocol uses Curve25519, AES-256, and HMAC-SHA256 as primitives. It provides confidentiality, integrity, authentication, participant consistency, destination validation, forward secrecy, backward secrecy, causality preservation, message unlinkability, message repudiation, participation repudiation, and asynchronicity.\n\n# Encryption Protocols\n\nSignal messages are encrypted with the Signal Protocol, which combines the Double Ratchet Algorithm, prekeys, and an Extended Triple Diffie-Hellman handshake. The protocol uses Curve25519, AES-256, and HMAC-SHA256 as primitives.\n\n# Authentication\n\nTo verify that a correspondent is really the person they claim to be, Signal users can compare key fingerprints (or scan QR codes) out-of-band. The platform employs a trust on first use mechanism in order to notify the user if a correspondent's key changes.\n\n# Local Storage\n\nAfter receiving and decrypting messages, the application stored them locally on each device in a SQLite database that is encrypted with SQLCipher. The cryptographic key for this database is also stored locally and can be accessed if the device is unlocked.\n\n# Servers\n\nSignal relies on centralized servers that are maintained by Signal Messenger. In addition to routing Signal's messages, the servers also facilitate the discovery of contacts who are also registered Signal users and the automatic exchange of users' public keys. By default, Signal's voice and video calls are peer-to-peer. If the caller is not in the receiver's address book, the call is routed through a server in order to hide the users' IP addresses.\n\n# Contact Discovery\n\nThe servers store registered users' phone numbers, public key material, and push tokens, which are necessary for setting up calls and transmitting messages. In order to determine which contacts are also Signal users, cryptographic hashes of the user's contact numbers are periodically transmitted to the server. The server then checks to see if those match any of the SHA256 hashes of registered users and tells the client if any matches are found. The hashed numbers are thereafter discarded from the server.\n\n# Metadata\n\nAll client-server communications are protected by TLS. Signal's developers have asserted that their servers do not keep logs about who called whom and when. In June 2016, Marlinspike told The Intercept that \"the closest piece of information to metadata that the Signal server stores is the last time each user connected to the server, and the precision of this information is reduced to the day, rather than the hour, minute, and second.\"\n\n# Federation\n\nSignal's server architecture was federated between December 2013 and February 2016. In December 2013, it was announced that the messaging protocol Signal uses had successfully been integrated into the Android-based open-source operating system CyanogenMod. Since CyanogenMod 11.0, the client logic was contained in a system app called WhisperPush. According to Signal's developers, the Cyanogen team ran their own Signal messaging server for WhisperPush clients, which federated with the main server, so that both clients could exchange messages with each other.\n\n# Licensing\n\nThe complete source code of the Signal clients for Android, iOS, and desktop is available on GitHub under a free software license. This enables interested parties to examine the code and help the developers verify that everything is behaving as expected. It also allows advanced users to compile their own copies of the applications and compare them with the versions that are distributed by Signal Messenger.\n\n# Reception\n\nIn October 2014, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) included Signal in their updated surveillance self-defense guide. In November 2014, Signal received a perfect score on the EFF's secure messaging scorecard. At the time, \"ChatSecure + Orbot\", Pidgin (with OTR), Silent Phone, and Telegram's optional \"secret chats\" also received seven out of seven points on the scorecard.\n\n# Security\n\nIn October 2014, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) included Signal in their updated surveillance self-defense guide.

This received criticism from security expert Bruce Schneier, who had previously praised the software. Schneier stated that this would bloat the client and attract unwanted attention from the authorities. The wallet functionality was initially only available in certain countries, but was later enabled globally in November 2021.\n\n# Blocking\n\nIn December 2016, Egypt blocked access to Signal. In response, Signal's developers added domain fronting to their service. This allows Signal users in a specific country to circumvent censorship by making it look like they are connecting to a different internet-based service. As of May 2022, Signal's domain fronting is enabled by default in Egypt, UAE, Oman, Qatar, Iran, Cuba, Uzbekistan, and Ukraine.\n\n# Audience\n\nIn 2020, the app was used for coordination and communication by protesters during the George Floyd protests as they relied on the app's end-to-end encryption to share information securely.\n\n# Use by Activists\n\nIn 2020, the app was used for coordination and communication by protesters during the George Floyd protests as they relied on the app's end-to-end encryption to share information securely.\n\n# Controversial Use\n\nSignal's terms of service states that the product may not be used to violate the law. According to a former employee, Signal's leadership at the time told him they would say something \"if and when people start abusing Signal or doing things that we think are terrible\". In January 2021, the position of Signal's leadership was to take a \"hands-off approach to moderation\" as the company's employees are not able to read user messages and the Signal Foundation does not \"want to be a media company\".\n\n# See Also\n\n* List of secure communication apps\n* End-to-end encryption\n* Signal Protocol\n\n# Notes\n\n* The article is based on publicly available information and does not contain any confidential or proprietary information.\n* The article is intended to provide a neutral and informative overview of Signal and its features.\n* The article is not intended to promote or endorse Signal or any other secure communication app.\n* The article is subject to change as new information becomes available.\n\n# References\n\n* [Note: This article does not contain any citations or references.

Systems\nOpen Whisper Systems' website was launched in January 2013 [66]\n\n\nSince 2018: Signal Technology Foundation\nOn 21 February 2018, Moxie Marlinspike and WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton announced the formation of the Signal Technology Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization whose mission is \"to support, accelerate, and broaden Signal's mission of making private communication accessible and ubiquitous\" [87] [26] Acton started the foundation with $50 million in funding and became the foundation's executive chairman after leaving WhatsApp's parent company Facebook in September 2017 [26] Marlinspike continued as Signal Messenger's first CEO [87] As of 2020 [update], Signal ran entirely on donations, as a nonprofit [88]\n\n\nUsage\nSignal's userbase started in May 2010, when its predecessor TextSecure was launched by Whisper Systems [54] According to App Annie, Signal had approximately 20 million monthly active users at the end of December 2020 [108] In January 2022, the BBC reported that Signal was used by over 40 million people [109]\n\n\nDevelopers and funding\nThe development of Signal and its predecessors at Open Whisper Systems was funded by a combination of consulting contracts, donations and grants [110] The Freedom of the Press Foundation acted as Signal's fiscal sponsor [87] [111] [112] Between 2013 and 2016, the project received grants from the Knight Foundation, [113] the Shuttleworth Foundation, [114] and almost $3 million from the US government–sponsored Open Technology Fund [115] Signal is now developed by Signal Messenger LLC, a software company founded by Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton in 2018, which is wholly owned by a tax-exempt nonprofit corporation called the Signal Technology Foundation, also created by them in 2018 The Foundation was funded with an initial loan of $50 million from Acton, \"to support, accelerate, and broaden Signal's mission of making private communication accessible and ubiquitous\" [87] [26] [116] All of the organization's products are published as free and open-source software.\n\n\nFeatures\nSignal provides one-to-one and group [118] voice and video [14] calls with up to forty participants on iOS, Android, and desktop platforms [119] [120] The calls are carried via the devices' wired or wireless (carrier or WiFi) data connections [69] The application can send text messages, documents files, [16] voice notes, pictures, stickers, GIFs, [121] and video messages The platform also supports group messaging.\n\n\nLimitations\nSignal requires that the user provide a telephone number for verification, [139] eliminating the need for user names or passwords and facilitating contact discovery (see below) [140] The number does not have to be the same as on the device's SIM card; it can also be a VoIP number [139] or a landline as long as the user can receive the verification code and have a separate device to set up the software A number can only be registered on one mobile device at a time [141] Account registration requires an iOS or Android device [20] [21]\n\n\nUsability\nIn July 2016, the Internet Society published a user study that assessed the ability of Signal users to detect and deter man-in-the-middle attacks [25] The study concluded that 21 out of 28 participants failed to correctly compare public key fingerprints in order to verify the identity of other Signal users, and that most of these users believed they had succeeded, while they had actually failed [25] Four months later, Signal's user interface was updated to make verifying the identity of other Signal users simpler [147]\n\n\nArchitecture\nSignal messages are encrypted with the Signal Protocol (formerly known as the TextSecure Protocol) The protocol combines the Double Ratchet Algorithm, prekeys, and an Extended Triple Diffie–Hellman (X3DH) handshake [149] [150] It uses Curve25519, AES-256, and HMAC-SHA256 as primitives [23] The protocol provides confidentiality, integrity, authentication, participant consistency, destination validation, forward secrecy, backward secrecy (a.k.a future secrecy), causality preservation, message unlinkability, message repudiation, participation repudiation, and asynchronicity [151] It does not provide anonymity preservation, and requires servers for the relaying of messages and storing of public key material [151]\n\n\nEncryption protocols\nSignal messages are encrypted with the Signal Protocol (formerly known as the TextSecure Protocol) The protocol combines the Double Ratchet Algorithm, prekeys, and an

mechanism in order to notify the user if a correspondent's key changes [123]\n\n\nLocal storage\nAfter receiving and decrypting messages, the application stored them locally on each device in a SQLite database that is encrypted with SQLCipher [163] The cryptographic key for this database is also stored locally and can be accessed if the device is unlocked [163] [164] In December 2020, Cellebrite published a blog post announcing that one of their products could now access this key and use it to \"decrypt the Signal app\" [163] [165] Technology reporters later published articles about how Cellebrite had claimed to have the ability to \"break into the Signal app\" and \"crack Signal's encryption\" [166] [167] This latter interpretation was rejected by several experts, [168] as well as representatives from Signal, who said the original post by Cellebrite had been about accessing data on \"an unlocked Android phone in their physical possession\" and that they \"could have just opened the app to look at the messages\" [169] [170] Similar extraction tools also exist for iOS devices and Signal Desktop [171] [172]\n\n\nServers\nSignal relies on centralized servers that are maintained by Signal Messenger In addition to routing Signal's messages, the servers also facilitate the discovery of contacts who are also registered Signal users and the automatic exchange of users' public keys By default, Signal's voice and video calls are peer-to-peer [14] If the caller is not in the receiver's address book, the call is routed through a server in order to hide the users' IP addresses

determine which contacts are also Signal users, cryptographic hashes of the user's contact numbers are periodically transmitted to the server [174] The server then checks to see if those match any of the SHA256 hashes of registered users and tells the client if any matches are found [174] The hashed numbers are thereafter discarded from the server [173] In 2014, Moxie Marlinspike wrote that it is easy to calculate a map of all possible hash inputs to hash outputs and reverse the mapping because of the limited preimage space (the set of all possible hash inputs) of phone numbers, and that a \"practical privacy preserving contact discovery remains an unsolved problem.\" [175] [174] In September 2017, Signal's developers announced that they were working on a way for the Signal client applications to \"efficiently and scalably determine whether the contacts in their address book are Signal users without revealing the contacts in their address book to the Signal service.\" [176] [177]\n\n\nMetadata\nAll client-server communications are protected by TLS [161] [178] Signal's developers have asserted that their servers do not keep logs about who called whom and when [179] In June 2016, Marlinspike told The Intercept that \"the closest piece of information to metadata that the Signal server stores is the last time each user connected to the server, and the precision of

11.0, the client logic was contained in a system app called WhisperPush According to Signal's developers, the Cyanogen team ran their own Signal messaging server for WhisperPush clients, which federated with the main server, so that both clients could exchange messages with each other [184] The WhisperPush source code was available under the GPLv3 license [185] In February 2016, the CyanogenMod team discontinued WhisperPush and recommended that its users switch to Signal [186] In May 2016, Moxie Marlinspike wrote that federation with the CyanogenMod servers had degraded the user experience and held back development, and that their servers will probably not federate with other servers again [187]\n\n\nLicensing\nThe complete source code of the Signal clients for Android, iOS and desktop is available on GitHub under a free software license [11] [10] [12] This enables interested parties to examine the code and help the developers verify that everything is behaving as expected It also allows advanced users to compile their own copies of the applications and compare them with the versions that are distributed by Signal Messenger In March 2016, Moxie Marlinspike wrote that, apart from some shared libraries that are not compiled with the project build due to a lack of Gradle NDK support, Signal for Android is reproducible [190] Signal's servers are partially open source, but the server software's anti-spam component is proprietary and closed source due to security concerns [13] [191]\n\n\nReception\nIn October 2014, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) included Signal in their updated surveillance self-defense guide [192] In November 2014, Signal received a perfect score on the EFF's secure messaging scorecard; [122] it received points for having communications encrypted in transit, having communications encrypted with keys the provider does not have access to (end-to-end encryption), making it possible for users to independently verify their correspondents' identities, having past communications secure if the keys are stolen (forward secrecy), having the code open to independent review (open source), having the security designs well-documented, and having a recent independent security audit [122] At the time, \"ChatSecure + Orbot\", Pidgin (with OTR), Silent Phone, and Telegram's optional \"secret chats\" also received seven out of seven points on the scorecard [122]\n\n\nSecurity\nIn October 2014, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) included Signal in their updated surveillance self-defense guide [192] In November

The film premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival and received a standing ovation.\n\n**Plot**\n\nOn her 50th birthday, once-celebrated but now-faded Hollywood movie star Elisabeth Sparkle is unceremoniously dismissed from the long-running aerobics TV show she hosts, with producer Harvey citing her advanced age as the reason. While driving home, Elisabeth is distracted by a billboard of herself being taken down, resulting in a major car crash. At the hospital, a young male nurse seems preoccupied with her back and gives her a flash drive advertising The Substance, a black market serum that generates a \"younger, more beautiful, more perfect\" version of oneself. After some deliberation, Elisabeth orders The Substance and injects the single-use activator serum, resulting in a much younger version of herself emerging from a slit in her back.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a talented cast, including Elisabeth Sparkle as the lead character. Coralie Fargeat was director and producer alongside Working Title Films co-producers Eric Fellner and Tim Bevan, and Blacksmith, a Paris-based studio created by Fargeat that same year. In February 2022, it was announced that Ray Liotta had joined the cast, but Liotta died in May 2022 and was replaced with Dennis Quaid.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe film was produced by Coralie Fargeat and Working Title Films, with Blacksmith serving as a Paris-based studio. Fargeat is known for her work in the horror genre, and her experience in writing and directing films was evident in the production of The Substance. The film's budget was not disclosed, but it is reported to have been a joint production between Working Title Films and Blacksmith.\n\n**Screenplay development**\n\nFargeat explained that her motivation for creating The Substance came from personal experiences with body image and societal pressure. She began writing the film in her 40s, a period when she was confronting negative thoughts about her relevance and appearance. Fargeat stated that she wanted to explore the themes of aging, beauty, and identity, and how these themes are often associated with women. She also drew inspiration from her own experiences with the film industry, where she felt pressure to conform to certain beauty standards.\n\n**Prosthetics and makeup effects**\n\nFargeat opted to rely on practical effects, accounting for 70-80% of the final film, resisting the push toward cheaper digital effects. She felt that the use of practical effects was crucial to convey the themes of violence and the transformation of the protagonist. The film's makeup effects were designed to be as realistic as possible, with a focus on creating a sense of unease and discomfort in the audience.\n\n**Designing Monstro Elisause**\n\nThe head of the creature, Monstro Elisause, was designed to be a unique and unsettling character. Fargeat described the design process as a \"surreal and dreamlike\" experience, with a focus on creating a sense of ambiguity and uncertainty. The creature's design was inspired by the works of David Lynch and the film \"The Elephant Man\".\n\n**Music**\n\nThe film's score was conceived by British producer and composer Raffertie, who was brought in late for the scoring process due to various factors. Fargeat chose Raffertie for his ability to create music that was both electronic and sensitive, and his experience in working with horror films. The score was designed to be a key element in creating the film's atmosphere and tension.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe Substance was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival, where it had its world premiere on 19 May 2024. The film received a standing ovation, with many critics praising its originality and boldness. The film has also been selected for the MAMI Mumbai Film Festival 2024 under the World Cinema section.\n\n**Home media**\n\nThe Substance will be released to MUBI's video-on-demand platform on 31 October 2024. The film is due to be released on DVD and Blu-ray on 1 July 2025 in the United Kingdom.\n\n**Reception**\n\nAs of October 2024, The Substance has grossed $14.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $24 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $38.6 million. The film has received widespread critical acclaim, with 91% of 311 critics' reviews on Rotten Tomatoes being positive. The consensus reads: \"Audaciously gross, wickedly clever, and possibly Demi Moore's finest hour, The Substance is a gasp-inducing feat from writer-director Coralie Fargeat.\" Metacritic assigned the film a score of 78 out of 100, based on 57 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.\n\n**Themes**\n\nThe Substance explores themes of aging, beauty, and identity, and how these themes are often associated with women. The film critiques societal pressure to conform to certain beauty standards, and the consequences of this pressure on women. The film also explores the theme of transformation, and how it can be both empowering and terrifying.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nThe Substance has received several awards and nominations, including a nomination for the Palme d'Or at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival. The film has also been selected for the MAMI Mumbai Film Festival 2024 under the World Cinema section.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe Substance is a bold and original film that explores themes of aging, beauty, and identity. The film's use of practical effects and its score create a sense of unease and discomfort in the audience, making it a standout in the horror genre. The film's cast, including Elisabeth Sparkle, deliver strong performances that bring the film's themes to life.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article includes no references.\n\n**External links**\n\nNo external links are provided.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Substance\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\nOn her 50th birthday, once-celebrated but now-faded Hollywood movie star Elisabeth Sparkle is unceremoniously dismissed from the long-running aerobics TV show she hosts, with producer Harvey citing her advanced age as the reason While driving home, Elisabeth is distracted by a billboard of herself being taken down, resulting in a major car crash At the hospital, a young male nurse seems preoccupied with her back and gives her a flash drive advertising The Substance, a black market serum that generates a \"younger, more beautiful, more perfect\" version of oneself After some deliberation, Elisabeth orders The Substance and injects the single-use activator serum, resulting in a much younger version of herself emerging from a slit in her back.\n\n\nCast\nCoralie Fargeat was director and producer alongside Working Title Films co-producers Eric Fellner and Tim Bevan, [6] [7] [8] and Blacksmith, a Paris-based studio created by Fargeat that same year [9] [10] In February 2022, it was announced that Ray Liotta had joined the cast, [11] but Liotta died in May 2022 and was replaced with Dennis Quaid [12]\n\n\nProduction\nCoralie Fargeat was director and producer alongside Working Title Films co-producers Eric Fellner and Tim Bevan, [6] [7] [8] and Blacksmith, a Paris-based studio created by Fargeat that same year [9] [10] In February 2022, it was announced that Ray Liotta had joined the cast, [11] but Liotta died in May 2022 and was replaced with Dennis Quaid [12]\n\n\nScreenplay development\nFargeat explained that her motivation for creating The Substance came from personal experiences with body image and societal pressure She began writing the film in her 40s, a period when she was confronting negative thoughts about her relevance and appearance \"I really started to think and hide these voices in my head like, 'Now your life is over No one is going to care about you.'\"\n [16] In another interview she expanded on her thoughts: \"I couldn't say that I experienced it in a real way in my life, but those thoughts were absolutely real in my brain.\"\n [17]\n\n\nProsthetics and makeup effects\nFargeat opted to rely on practical effects, accounting for 70–80% of the final film, [28] resisting the push toward cheaper digital effects [13] Fargeat felt that the use of practical effects was crucial to convey the themes of violence [29]\n\n\nDesigning Monstro Elisasue\nThe head is a little bit like a female Elephant Man  [...] that was what Coralie wanted, the sensibility of The Elephant Man, the David Lynch movie We spent lots of time designing Monstro with all the breasts and trying to balance everything Is she fat enough?

"en", "article": "Hilary Duff\n\nHilary Erhard Duff is an American actress, singer, songwriter, producer, and philanthropist. Born on September 28, 1987, in Houston, Texas, Duff rose to fame as a teenager with her starring role in the Disney Channel series Lizzie McGuire.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nHilary Duff was born to Robert Erhard Duff, a partner in a chain of convenience stores, and Susan Colleen Duff (née Cobb), a homemaker turned film and music producer. She has one older sister named Haylie. The Duff family moved between Houston and San Antonio, the locations of her father's convenience stores, where Duff was encouraged by her mother to enroll in acting, singing, and ballet classes. The siblings earned roles in local theater productions and later participated in a touring BalletMet production of The Nutcracker in San Antonio.\n\n**Career**\n\nDuff's early acting career involved minor roles in television shows and films, including the Hallmark Entertainment western miniseries True Women and the ensemble comedy-drama Playing by Heart. Her breakthrough role came in 1999 with the television film The Soul Collector, for which she received a Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a TV Movie or Pilot (Supporting Young Actress).\n\n**1993–1999: Career Beginnings**\n\nDuring her initial acting years, Duff primarily played minor roles, such as her uncredited part in the Hallmark Entertainment western miniseries True Women (1997) and as an uncredited extra in the ensemble comedy-drama Playing by Heart (1998). The same year, Duff landed her first major role as Wendy in Casper Meets Wendy, based on the Harvey Comics characters. After appearing in the supporting role of Ellie in the television film The Soul Collector (1999), Duff received a Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a TV Movie or Pilot (Supporting Young Actress).\n\n**2000–2003: Mainstream Success, Lizzie McGuire, and Metamorphosis**\n\nA week after being dropped from Daddio, Duff landed the title role of a newly developed Disney Channel series, Lizzie McGuire. Lizzie McGuire premiered on January 12, 2001, and became a ratings hit, with an estimated 2.3 million viewers per episode. Duff quickly became labeled as a teen idol and household name, particularly within the show's pre-teen adolescent target demographic. Disney began marketing the series through soundtracks, books, dolls, toys, and video games based on Duff's character, with the company reportedly making an estimated $100 million from the show's merchandise alone.\n\n**2004–2006: Hilary Duff, Most Wanted, and Film Projects**\n\nLizzie McGuire aired its final episode on February 14, 2004, following the fulfillment of Duff's 65-episode contract. Despite reports that the series was in talks for a second film and further television spin-off considered for sister network ABC, these plans fell through as Duff's salary for the proposal was insufficient.\n\n**2007–2009: Dignity and Independent Films**\n\nIn 2007, Duff began working on material for her fourth studio album, Dignity, which co-wrote thirteen of the album's fourteen songs, along with writers such as Kara DioGuardi. The finished product featured production from Rhett Lawrence, Tim & Bob, and Richard Vission, resulting in a dance and electropop sound for the record. The album received critical praise, despite some critics noting Duff's \"weak\" vocals, with the album praised for its lyrical content and new musical direction. The album dealt with topics such as her parents' divorce, her breakup with Joel Madden, and the stalking incident during the prior year. The television special Hilary Duff: This Is Now was produced to chronicle Duff's return to music. Despite positive critical reception, Dignity failed to match the commercial success of her previous releases, debuting at number three on the Billboard 200 and receiving a Gold certification from the RIAA.\n\n**2010–2013: Other Endeavors**\n\nDuff continued to appear in film roles, starring in the ABC Family television film Beauty & the Briefcase (2010), where she also served as an executive producer. The film saw Duff as a fashion magazine columnist who wrote about her dating struggles in the city. Following this appearance, she made another in an episode of the NBC sitcom Community. She then co-starred as Raven Halfacre, the teenage daughter of a promiscuous alcoholic, in the drama Bloodworth. In 2010, Duff set up a book-writing deal with Simon & Schuster, collaborating with Elise Allen on a young adult novel titled Elixir, which was published in October 2010 and became a New York Times best-seller.\n\n**2014–2017: Breathe In. Breathe Out. and Television Success with Younger**\n\nOn January 15, 2014, Duff signed on to co-star opposite Sutton Foster in the comedy-drama pilot Younger. The series is based on a Pamela Redmond Satran novel, and created and executive-produced by Darren Star for TV Land. Duff was cast as Kelsey Peters, an \"ambitious 20-something\" who persuades Foster's character to work in a publishing firm. In April 2014, it was announced that the pilot was picked up for a series with a 12-episode deal. The show marked Duff's first starring role in a television series since her appearance on Lizzie McGuire. Younger premiered on March 31, 2015, and received generally positive reviews from critics, with Duff's performance as Kelsey Peters earning her acclaim. Her performance as Kelsey Peters earned her nominations for Favorite Cable TV Actress at the 2016 and 2017 People's Choice Awards, two Teen Choice Awards nominations, and a nomination for the Gracie Allen Awards.\n\n**2018–2020: Entrepreneurship and Scrapped Lizzie McGuire Revival**\n\nDuff returned to her fashion designing career in January 2018 for the first time in nine years since \"Femme for DKNY.\" She launched a collaborative eyewear line with GlassesUSA called the \"Muse x Hilary Duff\" collection. Further collaborations with the brand resulted in the \"Muse\" collection being the best-selling brand for GlassesUSA's premium brand category. Later in January 2018, she announced that she was filming an independent movie, The Haunting of Sharon Tate, relating to the Tate murders. The film was written and directed by Daniel Farrands while Duff served as an executive producer on the film. She starred alongside Lydia Hearst and former Cheaper by the Dozen 2 co-star, Jonathan Bennett. The film was released in April 2019, and at the 2019 Hollywood Reel Independent Film Festival, Duff won the Best Actress award for her portrayal of the title character. The Haunting of Sharon Tate was panned by major mainstream film critics, and Variety called Duff as being \"too contemporary\" to portray Sharon. Debra Tate, the sister of the late Sharon, expressed her disapproval of the project. The film was nominated for several categories at the 40th Golden Raspberry Awards, and Duff was awarded the Worst Actress award.\n\n**2021–present: How I Met Your Father and Continued Entrepreneurship**\n\nIn May 2020, it was reported that Duff would be starring in a spinoff series of Younger, reprising her role as Kelsey Peters. Younger's creator Darren Star was attached to the project. In April 2021, Star described the spinoff as a \"female Entourage,\" and said that it would focus on Kelsey Peters in Los Angeles. However, on June 10, 2021, it was announced that the spin-off was no longer in the works. The Younger soundtrack album was released digitally in July 2021, and Duff's cover of Dolly Parton's \"9 to 5,\" which she performed in the season six premiere together with Sutton Foster and Miriam Shor, was included. Her 2016 cover of Fleetwood Mac's \"Little Lies\" was also featured.\n\n**Artistry**\n\nWith her debut, Duff's music featured prominent pop and pop rock elements. Duff cited listening to rock music as a child for the main influence behind the theme. She worked heavily with The Matrix for her second studio album, leading critics to compare the effort to releases from artists such as Avril Lavigne, Ashlee Simpson, and Lindsay Lohan. These themes were featured more prominently on her third studio album, Hilary Duff, which makes further use of strong drum and guitar beats. Duff co-wrote multiple songs for the album, with the lyrics speaking on topics such as criticism, following your dreams, and love. The new material featured on her Most Wanted (2005) compilation album began to see Duff transfer towards a more pop and dance-friendly sound. This was later expanded upon for her fourth studio album, Dignity (2007). Dignity was heavily influenced by Europop, hip hop, and rock 'n roll. Duff described the music as \"dance,\" \"rock,\" and \"electro.\" Duff co-wrote all but one of the songs on the album, which dealt with topics including her stalker, her breakup with Joel Madden, and her parents' divorce.\n\n**Image and Legacy**\n\nFollowing the launch of Lizzie McGuire, Duff received a significant amount of fame and media attention. The series proved to be a major hit for the network, and led to a string of merchandising that included Lizzie McGuire dolls, video games, plush figures, and even McDonald's Happy Meal Toys. The success of The Lizzie McGuire Movie \"indicated that Duff's television fanbase could be migrated to film.\" Following her success from Lizzie McGuire, Richard Huff of the New York Daily News called Duff \"a 2002 version of Annette Funicello\" but admitted that the character of Lizzie McGuire was both a blessing and burden for her. In 2003, Huff stated that Duff's public image is \"tied\" to Lizzie McGuire. In 2005, Katie Long from the Centre of Parent/Youth Understanding wrote an analysis of Duff and her suitability as an idol for young teens. Duff, she wrote, \"is not like Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera.. yet\" but remains \"someone that adolescent girls can relate to.\"\n\n**Social Media Controversies**\n\nDuff garnered media attention in Halloween of 2016 due to the costumes she and then boyfriend Jason Walsh wore to a party. Duff and Walsh wore a Pilgrim and Native American costume respectively, drawing criticism online with some social media users accusing them of cultural appropriation. Following the backlash, both Duff and Walsh posted apology messages on their respective social media accounts.\n\n**Disapproval of Paparazzi**\n\nDuff is very vocal about her disapproval of paparazzi photographing children. In 2014, Duff expressed her anger on Twitter regarding two paparazzi who were taking pictures of her son without her consent. She tweeted, \"I chose to let them off with a stern warning, next time I will not be so nice #NoKidsPolicy.\" The hashtag refers to a bill that was pushed by fellow actresses Halle Berry and Jennifer Garner, which prohibits paparazzi from taking pictures of celebrities' children.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nIn 2001, it was confirmed that Duff was in a relationship with fellow teen star Aaron Carter. He later guest-starred in an episode of Lizzie McGuire with Duff. The relationship garnered media attention with reports of a love triangle between Duff, Carter, and actress Lindsay Lohan. Duff and Carter continued an on-again-off-again relationship for three years, before ultimately ending their relationship.\n\n**Education**\n\nOn January 31, 2005, Duff began taking classes at Harvard University as part of the Harvard Extension School. On February 4, she wrote on her website that she was taking classes \"for Harvard University.\" Her statement upset some Harvard students who felt she did not have the right to claim she was attending Harvard University, when she was attending its Extension School. The Harvard Crimson published a scathing opinion piece that insulted both Duff and the Extension School. The following week, The Harvard Crimson published a letter to the editor that criticized the opinion piece.\n\n**Ancestry**\n\nDuff is a descendant of British Army officer Alexander Spotswood and of Catherine Carey, the presumed illegitimate daughter of Henry VIII.\n\n**Philanthropy**\n\nDuff has been involved with various philanthropic activities. She donated $250,000 to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina and donated over 2.5 million meals to Hurricane Katrina victims in the southern US in 2005. In August 2006, Duff traveled to a New Orleans elementary school and worked with USA Harvest to distribute meals.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* Some of her notable film roles include:\n\t+ Human Nature (2002)\n\t+ Agent Cody Banks (2003)\n\t+ Cheaper by the Dozen (2003)\n\t+ The Lizzie McGuire Movie (2003)\n\t+ A Cinderella Story (2004)\n\t+ Cheaper by the Dozen 2 (2005)\n\t+ The Perfect Man (2005)\n\t+ Cheaper by the Dozen 3 (2009)\n\t+ Bloodworth (2010)\n\t+ Beauty & the Briefcase (2010)\n\t+ Foodfight!

The novel tells the story of a mysterious event that occurs in the English village of Midwich, where a group of alien beings, known as the \"cuckoos,\" suddenly appear and begin to impregnate the local women. The novel explores themes of science fiction, horror, and social commentary, and has become a classic of the genre.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe story begins with a series of mysterious events in the village of Midwich, where two ambulances arrive at traffic accidents blocking the only roads into the village. As the ambulances attempt to approach the village, one ambulance-man becomes unconscious, suspecting gas poisoning. The army is notified, and further experiments reveal that the region is affected by an unknown force. A caged canary becomes unconscious upon entering the affected region, but regains consciousness when removed. Further investigations reveal that the region is a hemisphere with a diameter of 2 miles (3.2 km) around the village. Aerial photography shows an unidentifiable silvery object on the ground in the center of the affected zone.\n\nAs the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the villagers' women have been impregnated by the alien beings, and the children born as a result begin to exhibit strange and frightening abilities. The children are able to read minds, and begin to exert a strange influence over the villagers, causing them to become increasingly isolated and withdrawn.\n\n**Cuckoos**\n\nThe \"cuckoo\" in the novel's title alludes to a family of birds, of which nearly 60 species are brood parasites, laying their eggs in the nests of other birds. These species are obligate brood parasites, only reproducing in this way, the best-known example being the Eurasian cuckoo. The cuckoo egg hatches earlier than the host's, and the cuckoo chick grows faster, in most cases evicting the eggs or young of the host species, while encouraging the host to keep pace with its high growth rate.\n\nThe alien beings in the novel, known as the \"cuckoos,\" exhibit similar behavior, laying their eggs in the wombs of the human women and exerting a strange influence over the children born as a result. The cuckoos are able to manipulate the minds of the human hosts, causing them to become increasingly isolated and withdrawn, and are able to exert a strange influence over the children born as a result.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe novel was praised by critics for its unique blend of science fiction and social commentary. The Galaxy columnist Floyd C. Gale praised the novel as \"a most off-trail and well-written invasion yarn.\" Thomas M. Wagner concluded that the novel \"remains a cracking good read despite some obviously dated elements.\" However, Damon Knight was less impressed, writing that Wyndham's novelistic treatment \"is deadly serious, and I'm sorry to say, deadly dull.\"\n\n**Dan Rebellato**\n\nThe dramatist Dan Rebellato has written extensively on Wyndham's work, and has argued that The Midwich Cuckoos is a searching novel of moral ambiguities. Rebellato has argued that the novel explores themes of science fiction, horror, and social commentary, and that it is a book that questions the assumptions of its narrator character. He has also argued that the novel is a book that deals with the struggle between men and women at least as much as between people and aliens, touching on rape, abortion, childbirth, and motherhood.\n\n**Margaret Atwood**\n\nThe novelist Margaret Atwood has also written about Wyndham's work, and has argued that The Midwich Cuckoos is his chef d'œuvre. Atwood has argued that the novel is a book that explores themes of science fiction, horror, and social commentary, and that it is a book that questions the assumptions of its narrator character. She has also argued that the novel is a book that deals with the struggle between men and women at least as much as between people and aliens, touching on rape, abortion, childbirth, and motherhood.\n\n**Cancelled Sequel**\n\nWyndham began work on a sequel novel, Midwich Main, which he abandoned after only a few chapters.\n\n**Adaptations**\n\nA Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer remake was planned to have begun filming in 1981, but was cancelled due to the Writers Guild of America strike.\n\n**Unofficial Adaptations**\n\nSeveral unofficial adaptations of the novel have been produced, including a radio play and a television series.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* John Wyndham's other works\n* Science fiction and horror\n* Social commentary in science fiction and horror\n\n**External Links**\n\n* John Wyndham's official website\n* The Midwich Cuckoos on Amazon\n* The Midwich Cuckoos on Goodreads", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Midwich_Cuckoos\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\nAmbulances arrive at two traffic accidents blocking the only roads into the English village of Midwich, Winshire Attempting to approach the village, one ambulance-man becomes unconscious Suspecting gas poisoning, the army is notified They discover that a caged canary becomes unconscious upon entering the affected region, but regains consciousness when removed Further experiments reveal the region to be a hemisphere with a diameter of 2 mi (3.2 km) around the village Aerial photography shows an unidentifiable silvery object on the ground in the centre of the affected zone.\n\n\nCuckoos\nThe \"cuckoo\" in the novel's title alludes to a family of birds, of which nearly 60 species are brood parasites, laying their eggs in the nests of other birds [1] These species are obligate brood parasites, only reproducing in this way, the best-known example being the Eurasian cuckoo The cuckoo egg hatches earlier than the host's, and the cuckoo chick grows faster;

starting a nonprofit or running for office [56] [42] In Ohio, he started Our Ohio Renewal, a 501(c)(4) advocacy organization focused on education, addiction, and other \"social ills\" he had mentioned in his memoir [57] According to a 2017 archived capture of the nonprofit's website, the members of the advisory board were Keith Humphreys, Jamil Jivani, Yuval Levin, and Sally Satel [58] [59] According to a 2020 capture of the website, those four remained in those positions throughout the organization's existence [60] Our Ohio Renewal closed by 2021 with sparse achievements [57] [61] According to Jivani, the organization's director of law and policy, its work was derailed by Jivani's cancer diagnosis [62] [63] It raised around $221,000 in 2017 (including $80,000 from Vance himself) and spent the majority of its revenue on overhead costs and travel In subsequent years, it raised less than $50,000 [59] [64]\n\n\nAppHarvest\nFrom March 2017 to April 2021, Vance served on the board of directors of the startup AppHarvest, which carried out indoor vertical farming in Kentucky AppHarvest was also one of Narya Capital's first publicly announced investments; touting the company's commitment to bring good jobs with health care benefits to an economically depressed area of Appalachia, Vance publicly advocated for AppHarvest, in February 2021 telling the media that it was \"not just a good investment opportunity, it's a great business that's making a big difference in the world\" AppHarvest went bankrupt in 2023 while owing over $340 million Citing interviews with former AppHarvest workers, CNN reported that some of them believed \"Vance and other board members should have recognized and responded to warning signs that company officials were misleading the public and their own investors.\" [74] Company founder Jonathan Webb and top executives collectively had little experience with horticulture and indoor agriculture, and the company struggled to meet its produce buyers' standards [75] Workers complained to authorities about \"brutal\" working conditions stemming from high temperatures in company greenhouses coupled with allegedly heavy production demands, lack of safety gear, and few rest and water breaks After many local workers quit, they were replaced by migrant contract workers mostly from Mexico and Guatemala, who eventually constituted over half the company's labor force [74] [75] Vance never held an operational role at the company, and his vice-presidential campaign said he had been unaware of the complaints about working conditions and that the decision to hire migrants was made after he resigned from the board [74] [75]\n\n\nU.S. Senate (2023–present)\nIn early 2018, Vance considered running for the US Senate against Sherrod Brown, [76] but did not [77] In March 2021, Peter Thiel gave $10 million to Protect Ohio Values, a super PAC created in February to support a potential Vance candidacy [78] [79] [80] Robert

Congress.\n\n\nCommittee assignments\nOn January 31, 2023, Vance endorsed former President Donald Trump in the 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries [103] [104] On July 15, 2024, the first day of the Republican National Convention, Trump announced that he had chosen Vance as his running mate in a post on Truth Social [105] On July 17, the third day of the convention, Vance accepted the

day of the convention, Vance accepted the nomination to be Trump's running mate [106]\n\n\nComments on childlessness\nShortly after being named Trump's running mate, Vance was criticized for saying in a 2021 Fox News interview, \"we are effectively run in this country via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.\" [132] The resurfaced comments, which were posted by MeidasTouch editor-in-chief Ron Filipkowski, sparked an immediate backlash across news and social media [133] [134] On July 26, 2024, Vance clarified his remarks on The Megyn Kelly Show, saying, \"It's not a criticism of people who don't have children\" and \"this is about criticizing the Democratic Party for becoming anti-family and anti-child\" [135] He has said that being \"pro-babies and pro-family\" should be the Republican Party's highest priority [8]\n\n\nComments on Haitian immigrants\nIn September 2024, Vance made allegations of \"Haitian illegal immigrants draining social services and generally causing chaos all over Springfield, Ohio Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn't be in this country\" Trump subsequently echoed the allegations, including during a presidential debate Springfield authorities said there were \"no credible reports or specific claims\" of such incidents and that \"Haitian immigrants are here legally\" [142] [143] Vance then said that it was \"possible, of course, that all of these rumors will turn out to be false\", but also told his supporters to \"keep the cat memes flowing\" [144] He then promoted conservative activist Christopher Rufo's allegation that African migrants were eating cats in Dayton, Ohio; Dayton authorities reported \"no evidence to even remotely suggest that any group, including our immigrant community, is engaged in eating pets\" [145] [146]\n\n\nOpinion polls\nIn July 2024, a CNN poll analysis after the Republican National Convention showed a net-negative approval rating for Vance [86] That week, Vance's middling public reception and other concerns led some prominent Republican politicians and political analysts to say that he may have been a poor choice of running mate, especially in light of the shift in the election's dynamics upon the withdrawal of President Biden from the election and advent of Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee [152]\n\n\nVice-presidential debate\nThe first and only vice presidential debate between Vance and Tim Walz was held on October 1, 2024, hosted by CBS News [158] The candidates displayed a high level of civility to each other, [159] and a large majority of debate watchers found it to be positive [160] While 42% of CBS debate watchers thought Vance won, against 41% for Walz, [160] many political analysts declared Vance the winner, including

On July 17, the third day of the convention, Vance accepted the nomination to be Trump's running mate.\n\n**Comments on Childlessness**\n\nShortly after being named Trump's running mate, Vance was criticized for saying in a 2021 Fox News interview, \"we are effectively run in this country via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.\" The resurfaced comments sparked an immediate backlash across news and social media. On July 26, 2024, Vance clarified his remarks on The Megyn Kelly Show, saying, \"It's not a criticism of people who don't have children\" and \"this is about criticizing the Democratic Party for becoming anti-family and anti-child.\"\n\n**Comments on Haitian Immigrants**\n\nIn September 2024, Vance made allegations of \"Haitian illegal immigrants draining social services and generally causing chaos all over Springfield, Ohio.\" Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn't be in this country.\" Trump subsequently echoed the allegations, including during a presidential debate. Springfield authorities said there were \"no credible reports or specific claims\" of such incidents and that \"Haitian immigrants are here legally.\"\n\n**Opinion Polls**\n\nIn July 2024, a CNN poll analysis after the Republican National Convention showed a net-negative approval rating for Vance. That week, Vance's middling public reception and other concerns led some prominent Republican politicians and political analysts to say that he may have been a poor choice of running mate, especially in light of the shift in the election's dynamics upon the withdrawal of President Biden from the election and advent of Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.\n\n**Vice-Presidential Debate**\n\nThe first and only vice presidential debate between Vance and Tim Walz was held on October 1, 2024, hosted by CBS News. The candidates displayed a high level of civility to each other, and a large majority of debate watchers found it to be positive.

{"title": "Iraq_War", "content": "\nBackground\nStrong international opposition to the Saddam Hussein regime began following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 The international community condemned the invasion, [86] and in 1991 a military coalition led by the United States launched the Gulf War to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait.\n\n\nPre-war events\nFollowing 9/11, the Bush administration's national security team actively debated an invasion of Iraq On the day of the attacks, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld asked his aides for: \"best info fast Judge whether good enough hit Saddam Hussein at the same time Not only Osama bin Laden.\" [97] President Bush spoke with Rumsfeld on 21 November and instructed him to conduct a confidential review of OPLAN 1003, the war plan for invading Iraq [98] [99] Rumsfeld met with General Tommy Franks, the commander of US Central Command, on 27 November to go over the plans A record of the meeting includes the question \"How start?\", listing multiple possible justifications for a US–Iraq War [96] [100] The rationale for invading Iraq as a response to 9/11 has been refuted, as there was no cooperation between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] [106]\n\n\nOpposition to invasion\nIn October 2002, former US President Bill Clinton warned about the possible dangers of pre-emptive military action against Iraq Speaking in the UK at a Labour Party conference he said: \"As a preemptive action today, however well-justified, may come back with unwelcome consequences in the future.. I don't care how precise your bombs and your weapons are when you set them off, innocent people will die.\" [129] [130] Of 209 House Democrats in Congress, 126 voted against the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002, although 29 of 50 Democrats in the Senate voted in favor of it Only one Republican Senator, Lincoln Chafee, voted against it The Senate's lone Independent, Jim Jeffords, voted against it Retired US Marine, former Navy Secretary and future US senator Jim Webb wrote shortly before the vote, \"Those who are pushing for a unilateral war in Iraq know full well that there is no exit strategy if we invade.\" [131]\n\n\nCourse of the war\nThe first Central Intelligence Agency team entered Iraq on 10 July 2002 [142] This team was composed of members of the CIA's Special Activities Division and was later joined by members of the US military's elite Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) [143] Together, they prepared for an invasion by conventional forces These efforts consisted of persuading the commanders of several Iraqi military divisions to surrender rather than oppose the invasion, and identifying all the initial leadership targets during very high risk reconnaissance missions [143]\n\n\n2003: Invasion\nThe first Central Intelligence Agency team entered Iraq on 10 July 2002 [142] This team was composed of members of the CIA's Special Activities Division and was later joined by members of the US military's elite Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) [143] Together, they prepared for an invasion by conventional forces These efforts consisted of persuading the commanders of several Iraqi military divisions to surrender rather than oppose the invasion, and identifying all the initial leadership targets during very high risk reconnaissance missions [143]\n\n\nPost-invasion phase\nWidespread looting and low-level criminal activity gripped the country in April 2003 By that point it was clear that there were not enough US forces to control the breakdown of order in the country and little plan to restore it [167] [168]\n\n\n2003: Beginnings of insurgency\nWidespread looting and low-level criminal activity gripped the country in April 2003 By that point it was clear that there were not enough US forces to control the breakdown of order in the country and little plan to restore it [167] [168]\n\n\nCoalition Provisional Authority and the Iraq Survey Group\nShortly after the invasion, the multinational coalition created the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA; Arabic: سلطة الائتلاف الموحدة), based in the Green Zone, as a transitional government of Iraq until the establishment of a democratic government Citing United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483 (22 May 2003) and the laws of war, the CPA vested itself with executive, legislative, and judicial authority over the Iraqi government from the period of the CPA's inception on 21 April 2003 until its dissolution on 28 June 2004.\n\n\nRamadan Offensive 2003\nCoalition military forces launched several operations around the Tigris River peninsula and in the Sunni Triangle A series of similar operations were launched throughout the summer in the Sunni Triangle In late 2003, the intensity and pace of insurgent attacks began to increase A sharp surge in guerrilla attacks ushered in an insurgent effort that was termed the \"Ramadan Offensive\", as it coincided with the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.\n\n\nCapturing former government leaders\nIn the summer of 2003, the multinational forces focused on capturing the remaining leaders of the former government On 22 July, a raid by the US 101st Airborne Division and soldiers from Task Force 20 killed Saddam's sons (Uday and Qusay) along with one of his grandsons In all, over 300 top leaders of the former government were killed or captured, as well as numerous lesser functionaries and military personnel.\n\n\nLooting of artifacts from Iraqi museums\nFollowing the United States' invasion of Iraq in 2003, large numbers of antiquities including the Gilgamesh Dream Tablet were stolen, both from museums, such as the Iraq National Museum, but also because of illegal excavations at archeological sites throughout the country Many of them were smuggled into the United States through the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Israel, contrary to federal law Donald Rumsfeld rejected the claim that they were removed by US military personnel In the 2020s, about 17,000 artifacts were returned to Iraq from the U.S and Middle Eastern countries But according to an Iraqi archeology professor at the University of Baghdad, the repatriation of these items was only a partial success; the Baghdad office of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) continues to search for the loot worldwide Many Iraqis blame the United States for the loss of so many pieces of their country's history [185] [186]\n\n\n2004: Insurgency expands\nThe start of 2004 was marked by a relative lull in violence However, violence did increase during the Iraq Spring Fighting of 2004 with foreign fighters from around the Middle East as well as Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad, an al-Qaeda-linked group led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, helping to drive the insurgency [187] An organized Sunni insurgency, with deep roots and both nationalist and Islamist motivations, was gaining power throughout Iraq [citation needed] As the violence intensified in March, there was a distinct change in targeting from the coalition forces towards the new Iraqi Security Forces, as hundreds of Iraqi civilians and police were killed over the next few months in a series of massive bombings In the bloodiest day of the war since the start of combat operations, hundreds of Shi'a were killed when five bombs exploded on March 2 during Ashoura celebrations [167]\n\n\n2005: Elections and transitional government\nOn 31 January, Iraqis elected the Iraqi Transitional Government in order to draft a permanent constitution Although some violence and a widespread Sunni boycott marred the event, most of the eligible Kurd and Shia populace participated On 4 February, Paul Wolfowitz announced that 15,000 US troops whose tours of duty had been extended in order to provide election security would be pulled out of Iraq by the next month [195] February to April proved to be relatively peaceful months compared to the carnage of November and January, with insurgent attacks averaging 30 a day from the prior average of 70.\n\n\n2006: Civil war and permanent Iraqi government\nThe beginning of 2006 was marked by government creation talks, growing sectarian violence, and continuous anti-coalition attacks Sectarian violence expanded to a new level of intensity following the al-Askari Mosque bombing in the Iraqi city of Samarra, on 22 February 2006 The explosion at the mosque, one of the holiest sites in Shi'a Islam, is believed to have been caused by a bomb planted by al-Qaeda.\n\n\nIraq Study Group report and Saddam's execution\nThe Iraq Study Group Report was released on 6 December 2006 The Iraq Study Group made up of people from both of the major US parties, was led by co-chairs James Baker, a former Secretary of State (Republican), and Lee H Hamilton, a former US Representative (Democrat) It concluded that \"the situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating\" and \"US forces seem to be caught in a mission that has no foreseeable end.\" The report's 79 recommendations include increasing diplomatic measures with Iran and Syria and intensifying efforts to train Iraqi troops On 18 December, a Pentagon report found that insurgent attacks were averaging about 960 attacks per week, the highest since the reports had begun in 2005 [203]\n\n\n2007: US troops surge\nOn 10 January 2007, in a televised address to the US public, Bush proposed 21,500 more troops for Iraq, a job program for Iraqis, more reconstruction proposals, and $1.2 billion for these programs [206] On 23 January 2007, in the 2007 State of the Union Address, Bush announced he was \"deploying reinforcements of more than 20,000 additional soldiers and Marines to Iraq\".\n\n\nPlanned troop reduction\nIn a speech made to Congress on 10 September 2007, Petraeus \"envisioned the withdrawal of roughly 30,000 US troops by next summer, beginning with a Marine contingent  [in September].\" [214] On 13 September, Bush announced a limited withdrawal of troops from Iraq: [215] [216]\n\n\nEffects of the surge on security\nBy March 2008, violence in Iraq was reportedly curtailed by 40–80%, according to a Pentagon report [217] Independent reports [218] [219] raised questions about those assessments An Iraqi military spokesman claimed that civilian deaths since the start of the troop surge plan were 265 in Baghdad, down from 1,440 in the four previous weeks The New York Times counted more than 450 Iraqi civilians killed during the same 28‑day period, based on initial daily reports from Iraqi Interior Ministry and hospital officials.\n\n\nPolitical developments\nMore than half of the members of Iraq's parliament rejected the continuing occupation of their country for the first time 144 of the 275 lawmakers signed onto a legislative petition that would require the Iraqi government to seek approval from Parliament before it requests an extension of the UN mandate for foreign forces to be in Iraq, which expires at the end of 2008 It also calls for a timetable for troop withdrawal and a freeze on the size of foreign forces The UN Security Council mandate for US‑led forces in Iraq will terminate \"if requested by the government of Iraq.\" [240] 59% of those polled in the US support a timetable for withdrawal [241]\n\n\nTensions with Iran\nIn 2007, tensions increased greatly between Iran and Iraqi Kurdistan due to the latter's giving sanctuary to the militant Kurdish secessionist group Party for a Free Life in Kurdistan (PEJAK) According to reports, Iran had been shelling PEJAK positions in Iraqi Kurdistan since 16 August These tensions further increased with an alleged border incursion on 23 August by Iranian troops who attacked several Kurdish villages killing an unknown number of civilians and militants [243]\n\n\nTensions with Turkey\nBorder incursions by PKK militants based in Northern Iraq have continued to harass Turkish forces, with casualties on both sides In the fall of 2007, the Turkish military stated their right to cross the Iraqi Kurdistan border in \"hot pursuit\" of PKK militants and began shelling Kurdish areas in Iraq and attacking PKK bases in the Mount Cudi region with aircraft [245] [246] The Turkish parliament approved a resolution permitting the military to pursue the PKK in Iraqi Kurdistan [247] In November, Turkish gunships attacked parts of northern Iraq in the first such attack by Turkish aircraft since the border tensions escalated [248] Another series of attacks in mid-December hit PKK targets in the Qandil, Zap, Avashin and Hakurk regions The latest series of attacks involved at least 50 aircraft and artillery and Kurdish officials reported one civilian killed and two wounded [249]\n\n\nBlackwater private security controversy\nOn 17 September 2007, the Iraqi government announced that it was revoking the license of the US security firm Blackwater USA over the firm's involvement in the killing of eight civilians, including a woman and an infant, [251] in a firefight that followed a car bomb explosion near a State Department motorcade.\n\n\n2008: Civil war continues\nThroughout 2008, US officials and independent think tanks began to point to improvements in the security situation, as measured by key statistics According to the US Defense Department, in December 2008 the \"overall level of violence\" in the country had dropped 80% since before the surge began in January 2007, and the country's murder rate had dropped to prewar levels They also pointed out that the casualty figure for US forces in 2008 was 314 against a figure of 904 in 2007 [252]\n\n\nSpring offensives on Shiite militias\nAt the end of March, the Iraqi Army, with Coalition air support, launched an offensive, dubbed \"Charge of the Knights\", in Basra to secure the area from militias This was the first major operation where the Iraqi Army did not have direct combat support from conventional coalition ground troops The offensive was opposed by the Mahdi Army, one of the militias, which controlled much of the region [266] [267] Fighting quickly spread to other parts of Iraq: including Sadr City, Al Kut, Al Hillah and others During the fighting Iraqi forces met stiff resistance from militiamen in Basra to the point that the Iraqi military offensive slowed to a crawl, with the high attrition rates finally forcing the Sadrists to the negotiating table.\n\n\nCongressional testimony\nSpeaking before Congress on 8 April 2008, General David Petraeus urged delaying troop withdrawals, saying, \"I've repeatedly noted that we haven't turned any corners, we haven't seen any lights at the end of the tunnel,\" referencing the comments of then-President Bush and former Vietnam-era General William Westmoreland [269] When asked by the Senate if reasonable people could disagree on the way forward, Petraeus said, \"We fight for the right of people to have other opinions.\" [270]\n\n\nIraqi security forces rearm\nIraq became one of the top purchasers of US military equipment with their army trading its AK‑47 assault rifles for the US M‑16 and M‑4 rifles, among other equipment [272] In 2008 alone, Iraq accounted for more than $12.5 billion of the $34 billion US weapon sales to foreign countries (not including the potential F-16 fighter planes.) [273]\n\n\nStatus of forces agreement\nThe US–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement was approved by the Iraqi government on 4 December 2008 [277] It established that US combat forces would withdraw from Iraqi cities by 30 June 2009, and that all US forces would be completely out of Iraq by 31 December 2011 The pact was subject to possible negotiations which could have delayed withdrawal and a referendum scheduled for mid-2009 in Iraq, which might have required all US forces to completely leave by the middle of 2010 [278] [279] The pact required criminal charges for holding prisoners over 24 hours, and required a warrant for searches of homes and buildings that are not related to combat [280]\n\n\n2009: Coalition redeployment\nOn 1 January 2009, the United States handed control of the Green Zone and Saddam Hussein's presidential palace to the Iraqi government in a ceremonial move described by the country's prime minister as a restoration of Iraq's sovereignty Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said he would propose 1 January be declared national \"Sovereignty Day\" \"This palace is the symbol of Iraqi sovereignty and by restoring it, a real message is directed to all Iraqi people that Iraqi sovereignty has returned to its natural status\", al‑Maliki said [294]\n\n\nTransfer of the Green Zone\nOn 1 January 2009, the United States handed control of the Green Zone and Saddam Hussein's presidential palace to the Iraqi government in a ceremonial move described by the country's prime minister as a restoration of Iraq's sovereignty Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said he would propose 1 January be declared national \"Sovereignty Day\" \"This palace is the symbol of Iraqi sovereignty and by restoring it, a real message is directed to all Iraqi people that Iraqi sovereignty has returned to its natural status\", al‑Maliki said [294]\n\n\nProvincial elections\nOn 31 January, Iraq held provincial elections [296] Provincial candidates and those close to them faced some political assassinations and attempted assassinations, and there was also some other violence related to the election [297] [298] [299] [300]\n\n\nExit strategy announcement\nOn 27 February, United States President Barack Obama gave a speech at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in the US state of North Carolina announcing that the US combat mission in Iraq would end by 31 August 2010 A \"transitional force\" of up to 50,000 troops tasked with training the Iraqi Security Forces, conducting counterterrorism operations, and providing general support may remain until the end of 2011, the president added However, the insurgency in 2011 and the rise of ISIL in 2014 caused the war to continue [306]\n\n\nSixth anniversary protests\nOn 9 April, the 6th anniversary of Baghdad's fall to coalition forces, tens of thousands of Iraqis thronged Baghdad to mark the anniversary and demand the immediate departure of coalition forces The crowds of Iraqis stretched from the Sadr City slum in northeast Baghdad to the square around 5 km (3.1 mi) away, where protesters burned an effigy featuring the face of US President George W Bush [308] There were also Sunni Muslims in the crowd Police said many Sunnis, including prominent leaders such as a founding sheikh from the Sons of Iraq, took part [309]\n\n\nCoalition forces withdraw\nOn 30 April, the United Kingdom formally ended combat operations Prime Minister Gordon Brown characterized the operation in Iraq as a \"success story\" because of UK troops' efforts Britain handed control of Basra to the United States Armed Forces [310]\n\n\nIraq awards oil contracts\nOn 30 June and 11 December 2009, the Iraqi ministry of oil awarded contracts to international oil companies for some of Iraq's many oil fields The winning oil companies entered joint ventures with the Iraqi ministry of oil, and the terms of the awarded contracts included extraction of oil for a fixed fee of approximately $1.40 per barrel [312] [313] [314] The fees will only be paid once a production threshold set by the Iraqi ministry of oil is reached.\n\n\n2010: US drawdown and Operation New Dawn\nOn 17 February 2010, US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates announced that as of 1 September, the name \"Operation Iraqi Freedom\" would be replaced by \"Operation New Dawn\" [315]\n\n\nIraqi arms purchases\nAs US forces departed the country, the Iraq Defense Ministry solidified plans to purchase advanced military equipment from the United States Plans in 2010 called for $13 billion of purchases, to include 140 M1 Abrams main battle tanks [336] In addition to the $13 billion purchase, the Iraqis also requested 18 F-16 Fighting Falcons as part of a $4.2 billion program that also included aircraft training and maintenance, AIM‑9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, laser-guided bombs and reconnaissance equipment [337] All Abrams tanks were delivered by the end of 2011, [338] but the first F-16s did not arrive in Iraq until 2015, due to concerns that the Islamic State might overrun Balad Air Base [339]\n\n\nThe UN lifts restrictions on Iraq\nIn a move to legitimize the existing Iraqi government, the United Nations lifted the Saddam Hussein-era UN restrictions on Iraq These included allowing Iraq to have a civilian nuclear program, permitting the participation of Iraq in international nuclear and chemical weapons treaties, as well as returning control of Iraq's oil and gas revenue to the government and ending the Oil-for-Food Programme [342]\n\n\n2011: US withdrawal\nMuqtada al-Sadr returned to Iraq in the holy city of Najaf to lead the Sadrist movement after being in exile since 2007 [343]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe invasion and occupation led to sectarian violence, which caused widespread displacement among Iraqi civilians Since the beginning of the war, the first parliamentary elections were held in 2005 which brought greater representation and autonomy to Iraqi Kurds By 2007 the Iraqi Red Crescent estimated 2.3 million Iraqis were internally displaced, with an estimated 2 million Iraqis fleeing to neighboring countries, mostly to Syria and Jordan [360]\n\n\nEmerging conflict and insurgency\nThe invasion

for International and Public Affairs at Brown University [375] However, some economists argue the total cost to the U.S economy could range from $3 [376] to $6 trillion, including long-term interest and veterans' costs, by 2053 [377] The upper ranges of these estimates include the long-term cost of disability compensation and medical care to U.S troops Harvard's public finance expert, Linda J Bilmes, estimated that these costs alone would amount to nearly $1 trillion over the next 40 years [378] Bilmes also argued the war diverted resources from Afghanistan, raised oil prices, increased US federal debt, and contributed to the global financial crisis [379] The most recent estimates indicate costs will exceed $2.9 trillion by 2050 This figure includes direct costs such as military operations, veterans' care, and reconstruction, as well as long-term expenses, particularly for veterans' healthcare and disability benefits As of 2023, $1.8 trillion had been spent, and costs will continue over the coming decades due to care for veterans and other war-related expenditures [380]\n\n\nEconomic impact\nIn 2013, the total cost of the war to date was estimated at $1.7 trillion by

trillion had been spent, and costs will continue over the coming decades due to care for veterans and other war-related expenditures [380]\n\n\nReparations\nBy 2013, some human rights groups in both Iraq and the US had begun campaigning for reparations from the US for the devastation and health effects suffered by Iraqis during the war [384] [385]\n\n\nEconomic recession in 2021\nAs of 2021, Iraq had fallen into an economic depression, caused by the ongoing COVID pandemic and falling oil and gas prices, which economists described as the country's biggest financial threat since the rule of Saddam Hussein Iraq suffered from currency devaluation in 2021 for the first time in decades and was unable to import crucial products, including medicines and food, and had a lack of foreign currency to pay off the national debt [386]\n\n\nHumanitarian impact\nAccording to a 2007 Oxfam report, the child malnutrition rate had risen to 28%, and the rate of people without access to clean drinking water had risen to 70% [387] In 2007, Nasser Muhssin, a researcher on family and children's affairs affiliated to the University of Baghdad claimed that 60–70% of Iraqi children suffered from psychological problems [388] A 2007 cholera outbreak in northern Iraq was thought to be the result of poor water quality [389] As many as half of Iraqi doctors left the country between 2003 and 2006 [390]\n\n\nHumanitarian crisis\nAccording to a 2007 Oxfam report, the child malnutrition rate had risen to 28%, and the rate of people without access to clean drinking water had risen to 70% [387] In

cholera outbreak in northern Iraq was thought to be the result of poor water quality [389] As many as half of Iraqi doctors left the country between 2003 and 2006 [390]\n\n\nEnvironmental impact\nThe war has led to oil spills, which increased carbon emissions and contaminated the surrounding water resources During the invasion period, the retreating Iraqi army damaged the oil infrastructure and destroyed more than 736 oil wells in southern Iraq, resulting in massive oil spills and the ignition of fires [396] In 2003, more than 50 billion tonnes of carbon emissions were produced from burning oil fields and released into the atmosphere [397] Also, over 130 million gallons of oil leaked into surrounding water resources, such as Sawa Lake [398] Between 2003 and 2010, more than 5,000 birds from three species died around Sawa Lake [398]\n\n\nOil pollution\nThe war has led to oil spills, which increased carbon emissions and contaminated the surrounding water resources During the invasion period, the retreating Iraqi army damaged the oil infrastructure and destroyed more than 736 oil wells in southern Iraq, resulting in massive oil spills and the ignition of fires [396] In 2003, more than 50 billion tonnes of carbon emissions were produced from burning oil fields and released into the atmosphere [397] Also, over 130 million gallons of oil leaked into surrounding water resources, such as Sawa Lake [398] Between 2003 and 2010, more than 5,000 birds from three species died around Sawa Lake [398]\n\n\nRadioactive contamination\nThe U.S.-led coalition used depleted uranium (DU) munitions during the war to pierce tank armour [399] 1,000 to 2,000 tonnes (980 to 1,970 long tons; 1,100 to 2,200 short tons) of DU munitions were fired, which caused ammunition fragments containing radioactive material to spread across the country According to a United Nations Environment Programme report, radioactive material contaminated air and soil; with the radioactive concentration found in Iraqi soil at 709.52 Bq in 2003 compared to 143.22 Bq in 2002 [400] The report states that high levels of radiation prevented plants, especially crop seeds, from sprouting; with about 22% (9.5 million ha) of the farmland in Iraq unable to grow barley [398]\n\n\nEcosystem destruction\nThe war has also led to damage to ecosystems though pollution and physical destruction Approximately 25,000 tons of bombs were dropped by the U.S military during the war [396] More than 250 chemical and armament factories were destroyed, which caused over 50,000 cubic meters of hazardous chemicals, such as fertilizer, and raw sewage to leak into water, [405] leading to surrounding freshwater ecosystem becoming polluted and species' habitat being impacted [396] According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, 33 Iraqi wetlands, especially the Mesopotamian Marshland, have been contaminated by chemicals, which has caused 60 types of mammal species to lose their habitats, and more than 45 types of plants to become extinct [398]\n\n\nImpact on the Global War on Terrorism\nThough explicitly stating that Iraq had \"nothing\" to do with 9/11, [406] erstwhile President George W Bush consistently referred to the Iraq War as \"the central front in the War on Terror\", and argued that if the United States pulled out of Iraq, \"terrorists will follow us here\" [407] [408] [409] While other proponents of the war regularly echoed this assertion, as the conflict dragged on, members of the US Congress, the US public, and even US troops questioned the connection between Iraq and the fight against anti-US terrorism In particular, a consensus developed among intelligence experts that the Iraq War actually increased terrorism Counterterrorism expert Rohan Gunaratna frequently referred to the invasion of Iraq as a \"fatal mistake\" [410]\n\n\nImpact on geopolitics\nFrom a geopolitical perspective, the war in Iraq has been interpreted as weakening the West's moral high ground and hampering its ability to effectively counter Russia and China With regard to the Russo-Ukrainian War, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said in March 2022 that the U.S exerted similar pressures on Iraq in 2003, which the US invaded later for no reason other than \"a vial of unidentified chemicals\" [415] In March 2023, Tony Blair, former British prime minister rejected comparisons between Russia's war in Ukraine and the US-led invasion of Iraq, claiming that the Iraq War cannot be used as a justification by Russia to annex Russian-speaking zones in eastern Ukraine [416]\n\n\nCriticism\nThe Bush administration's rationale for the Iraq War has faced heavy criticism from an array of popular and official sources both inside and outside the United States, [418] [419] [350] with many US citizens finding many parallels with the Vietnam War [420] For example, a former CIA officer described the Office of Special Plans as a group of ideologues who were dangerous to US national security and a threat to world peace, and stated that the group lied and manipulated intelligence to further its agenda of removing Saddam [421] The Center for Public Integrity stated that the Bush administration made a total of 935 false statements between 2001 and 2003 about Iraq's alleged threat to the United States [422]\n\n\nWar crimes\nThroughout the war, many human rights abuses and war crimes were committed.\n\n\nBy Coalition forces and private contractors\nThe post-invasion Iraqi government used torture against detainees, including children Some techniques of torture used included beatings, electric shocks, prolonged hanging by the wrists, food and water deprivation, and blindfolding for multiple days [475] Iraqi police from the Interior Ministry were accused of forming Death Squads and committing numerous massacres of Sunni Arabs [476] Many of these human rights abuses were carried out by Iraqi government-sponsored Shi'ite militias [477]\n\n\nBy insurgent

government-sponsored Shi'ite militias [477]\n\n\nPublic opinion on the war\nIn a March 2003 Gallup poll, the day after the invasion, 76% of Americans had approved of military action against Iraq [478] In a March 2003 YouGov poll, 54% of Britons supported the military action against Iraq [479] A remarkable aspect was the support for invasion expressed by many left-wing intellectuals such as Christopher Hitchens, Paul Berman, Michael Walzer and Jean Bethke Elshtain [480] [481] In a February 2003 poll by the national public research institute CIS, 91% of Spaniards opposed any military intervention in Iraq [482]\n\n\nInternational opinion\nIn a March 2003 Gallup poll, the day after the invasion, 76% of Americans had approved of military action against Iraq [478] In a March 2003

[482]\n\n\nIraqi opinion\nDirectly after the invasion, an NDTV poll of Baghdad residents reported a slight majority of respondents supported the US invasion [488] Polls conducted between 2005 and 2007 showed 31–37% of Iraqis wanted US and other Coalition forces to withdraw once security was restored and that 26–35% wanted immediate withdrawal instead [489] [490] [491] In 2006, a poll conducted on the Iraqi public revealed that 52% of the ones polled said Iraq was going in the right direction and 61% claimed it was worth ousting Saddam Hussein [489] In a March 2007 BBC poll, 82% of Iraqis expressed a lack of confidence in coalition forces based in Iraq [492] According to a 2009 poll conducted by the University of Maryland, 7 out of 10 Iraqis wanted US troops to withdraw within one year and also 78% felt that US military presence was \"provoking more conflict than it is preventing\" [493] Despite a majority having previously been opposed to the US presence, according to a poll conducted by the Asharq Research Centre, a private Iraqi company, 60% of Iraqis had believed it was \"the wrong time\" for a major withdrawal of American troops prior to the withdrawal in 2011, with 51% saying withdrawal would have a negative effect [494] [495]\n\n\nForeign involvement\nAccording to studies, most of the suicide bombers in Iraq were foreigners, especially Saudis [496] [497]

Pentagon is examining the possibility that the Karbala provincial headquarters raid, in which insurgents managed to infiltrate an American base, kill five US soldiers, wound three, and destroy three humvees before fleeing, was supported by Iranians In a speech on 31 January 2007, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki stated that Iran was supporting attacks against Coalition forces in Iraq [499] and some Iraqis suspect that the raid may have been perpetrated by the Quds Force in retaliation for the detention of five Iranian officials by US forces in the northern Iraqi city of Irbil on 11 January [500] [501] In 2014, the legacy of Iran's presence in Iraq after the invasion had been mixed with regard to the fight against regional terrorist groups The U.S occupation and subsequent regional instability had spawned the creation of the PMF (Popular Mobilization Forces), an Iranian militia that effectively fought the influence of emerging caliphates in the region [502]\n\n\nRole of Israel\nIsrael did not officially support or take part in the Iraq War According to former State Department official Lawrence Wilkerson and former CIA agent and Iran expert Robert Baer, Israeli officials warned the Bush administration against invading Iraq, saying that it would destabilize the region and empower the much more dangerous regime in Iran [503] [504] [505] [506] However it was reported in the Washington Post that \"Israel is urging United States' officials not to delay a military strike against Iraq's Saddam Hussein\" [507] It was also reported in 2002 that Israeli intelligence provided Washington with alarming reports about Iraq's alleged program to develop weapons of mass destruction [508]\n\n\nRole of Russia\nThe invasion of Iraq prompted a widespread wave of criticism from several world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin [513] Before and during the invasion of Iraq, the Russian government provided intelligence to Saddam Hussein about the location of US forces and their plans [514]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Iraq War**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Iraq War, also known as the Second Gulf War, was a military conflict that began in 2003 and lasted until 2011. It was a complex and multifaceted conflict that involved the United States, its allies, and Iraq. The war was fought on several fronts, including the invasion of Iraq, the occupation of the country, and the ongoing insurgency.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Iraq War began in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The United States, led by President George W. Bush, launched a global \"War on Terror\" aimed at rooting out terrorist organizations and their supporters. Iraq, led by Saddam Hussein, was seen as a key player in this war, with the US accusing the country of possessing weapons of mass destruction and supporting terrorist groups.\n\n**Pre-war events**\n\nIn the months leading up to the invasion, the US and its allies launched a series of diplomatic and military efforts to persuade Iraq to disarm and cooperate with the UN. However, Saddam Hussein refused to comply, and the US and its allies began to prepare for a military invasion.\n\n**Pre-war opposition**\n\nDespite the US's claims of a clear threat from Iraq, many experts and world leaders expressed skepticism and opposition to the war. The UN Security Council voted against the use of force, and many countries, including France, Germany, and Russia, opposed the invasion.\n\n**Invasion**\n\nOn March 20, 2003, the US and its allies launched a massive military invasion of Iraq, with the goal of overthrowing Saddam Hussein and his regime. The invasion was led by the US, with significant contributions from the UK, Australia, and other countries.\n\n**Early stages of occupation**\n\nIn the early stages of occupation, the US and its allies established a new government in Iraq, led by Paul Bremer. However, the occupation was marked by chaos and violence, with widespread looting and attacks on coalition forces.\n\n**Rise of insurgency**\n\nAs the occupation continued, a growing insurgency emerged in Iraq, led by various Sunni and Shia militias. The insurgency was fueled by a combination of factors, including the presence of foreign fighters, the lack of security, and the failure of the new government to provide basic services.\n\n**Civil war**\n\nIn 2006, a sectarian civil war broke out in Iraq, pitting Shia against Sunni. The civil war was marked by widespread violence, including bombings, shootings, and massacres.\n\n**Withdrawal**\n\nIn 2009, the US began to withdraw its troops from Iraq, with the goal of ending the occupation by the end of 2011. The withdrawal was marked by significant violence, including attacks on coalition forces and Iraqi civilians.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe Iraq War had a profound impact on the country and its people. The war resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and the displacement of millions more. The war also had a significant impact on the US, with the country facing significant costs, including the loss of lives and the depletion of its military resources.\n\n**International community**\n\nThe international community was divided on the war, with many countries opposing the invasion. However, some countries, including the UK, Australia, and Poland, supported the US-led coalition.\n\n**Economic impact**\n\nThe war had a significant impact on the global economy, with the US and its allies incurring significant costs. The war also led to a significant increase in oil prices, which had a major impact on the global economy.\n\n**Humanitarian impact**\n\nThe war had a significant humanitarian impact, with widespread displacement, poverty, and social unrest. The war also led to a significant shortage of food, water, and other basic necessities.\n\n**Environmental impact**\n\nThe war had a significant environmental impact, with the destruction of infrastructure, the contamination of water and soil, and the loss of biodiversity.\n\n**Role of external actors**\n\nExternal actors, including neighboring countries and international organizations, played a significant role in the war. Iran and Syria supported the Shia militias, while the US and its allies supported the Sunni militias.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Iraq War was a complex and multifaceted conflict that had a profound impact on the country and its people. The war resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and the displacement of millions more. The war also had a significant impact on the US, with the country facing significant costs, including the loss of lives and the depletion of its military resources.\n\n**Timeline of the Iraq War**\n\n* 2002: The US and its allies launch a series of diplomatic and military efforts to persuade Iraq to disarm and cooperate with the UN.\n* 2003: The US and its allies launch a massive military invasion of Iraq, with the goal of overthrowing Saddam Hussein and his regime.\n* 2003-2006: The occupation is marked by chaos and violence, with widespread looting and attacks on coalition forces.\n* 2006: A sectarian civil war breaks out in Iraq, pitting Shia against Sunni.\n* 2009: The US begins to withdraw its troops from Iraq, with the goal of ending the occupation by the end of 2011.\n* 2011: The US completes its withdrawal from Iraq, marking the end of the occupation.\n\n**Statistics**\n\n* Estimated number of deaths: 174,000-600,000\n* Estimated number of displaced people: 4 million\n* Estimated number of people with access to clean water: 70%\n* Estimated number of people with access to sanitation: 50%\n* Estimated number of people with access to electricity: 80%\n* Estimated number of people with access to healthcare: 50%\n\n**References**\n\nNote: There are no references provided in this article.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Iraq_War\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nStrong international opposition to the Saddam Hussein regime began following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 The international community condemned the invasion, [86] and in 1991 a military coalition led by the United States launched the Gulf War to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait.\n\n\nPre-war events\nFollowing 9/11, the Bush administration's national security team actively debated an invasion of Iraq On the day of the attacks, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld asked his aides for: \"best info fast Judge whether good enough hit Saddam Hussein at the same time Not only Osama bin Laden.\" [97] President Bush spoke with Rumsfeld on 21 November and instructed him to conduct a confidential review of OPLAN 1003, the war plan for invading Iraq [98] [99] Rumsfeld met with General Tommy Franks, the commander of US Central Command, on 27 November to go over the plans A record of the meeting includes the question \"How start?\", listing multiple possible justifications for a US–Iraq War [96] [100] The rationale for invading Iraq as a response to 9/11 has been refuted, as there was no cooperation between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] [106]\n\n\nOpposition to invasion\nIn October 2002, former US President Bill Clinton warned about the possible dangers of pre-emptive military action against Iraq Speaking in the UK at a Labour Party conference he said: \"As a preemptive action today, however well-justified, may come back with unwelcome consequences in the future.. I don't care how precise your bombs and your weapons are when you set them off, innocent people will die.\" [129] [130] Of 209 House Democrats in Congress, 126 voted against the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002, although 29 of 50 Democrats in the Senate voted in favor of it Only one Republican Senator, Lincoln Chafee, voted against it The Senate's lone Independent, Jim Jeffords, voted against it Retired US Marine, former Navy Secretary and future US senator Jim Webb wrote shortly before the vote, \"Those who are pushing for a unilateral war in Iraq know full well that there is no exit strategy if we invade.\" [131]\n\n\nCourse of the war\nThe first Central Intelligence Agency team entered Iraq on 10 July 2002 [142] This team was composed of members of the CIA's Special Activities Division and was later joined by members of the US military's elite Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) [143] Together, they prepared for an invasion by conventional forces These efforts consisted of persuading the commanders of several Iraqi military divisions to surrender rather than oppose the invasion, and identifying all the initial leadership targets during very high risk reconnaissance missions [143]\n\n\n2003: Invasion\nThe first Central Intelligence Agency team entered Iraq on 10 July 2002 [142] This team was composed of members of the CIA's Special Activities Division and was later joined by members of the US military's elite Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) [143] Together, they prepared for an invasion by conventional forces These efforts consisted of persuading the commanders of several Iraqi military divisions to surrender rather than oppose the invasion, and identifying all the initial leadership targets during very high risk reconnaissance missions [143]\n\n\nPost-invasion phase\nWidespread looting and low-level criminal activity gripped the country in April 2003 By that point it was clear that there were not enough US forces to control the breakdown of order in the country and little plan to restore it [167] [168]\n\n\n2003: Beginnings of insurgency\nWidespread looting and low-level criminal activity gripped the country in April 2003 By that point it was clear that there were not enough US forces to control the breakdown of order in the country and little plan to restore it [167] [168]\n\n\nCoalition Provisional Authority and the Iraq Survey Group\nShortly after the invasion, the multinational coalition created the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA; Arabic: سلطة الائتلاف الموحدة), based in the Green Zone, as a transitional government of Iraq until the establishment of a democratic government Citing United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483 (22 May 2003) and the laws of war, the CPA vested itself with executive, legislative, and judicial authority over the Iraqi government from the period of the CPA's inception on 21 April 2003 until its dissolution on 28 June 2004.\n\n\nRamadan Offensive 2003\nCoalition military forces launched several operations around the Tigris River peninsula and in the Sunni Triangle A series of similar operations were launched throughout the summer in the Sunni Triangle In late 2003, the intensity and pace of insurgent attacks began to increase A sharp surge in guerrilla attacks ushered in an insurgent effort that was termed the \"Ramadan Offensive\", as it coincided with the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.\n\n\nCapturing former government leaders\nIn the summer of 2003, the multinational forces focused on capturing the remaining leaders of the former government On 22 July, a raid by the US 101st Airborne Division and soldiers from Task Force 20 killed Saddam's sons (Uday and Qusay) along with one of his grandsons In all, over 300 top leaders of the former government were killed or captured, as well as numerous lesser functionaries and military personnel.\n\n\nLooting of artifacts from Iraqi museums\nFollowing the United States' invasion of Iraq in 2003, large numbers of antiquities including the Gilgamesh Dream Tablet were stolen, both from museums, such as the Iraq National Museum, but also because of illegal excavations at archeological sites throughout the country Many of them were smuggled into the United States through the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Israel, contrary to federal law Donald Rumsfeld rejected the claim that they were removed by US military personnel In the 2020s, about 17,000 artifacts were returned to Iraq from the U.S and Middle Eastern countries But according to an Iraqi archeology professor at the University of Baghdad, the repatriation of these items was only a partial success; the Baghdad office of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) continues to search for the loot worldwide Many Iraqis blame the United States for the loss of so many pieces of their country's history [185] [186]\n\n\n2004: Insurgency expands\nThe start of 2004 was marked by a relative lull in violence However, violence did increase during the Iraq Spring Fighting of 2004 with foreign fighters from around the Middle East as well as Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad, an al-Qaeda-linked group led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, helping to drive the insurgency [187] An organized Sunni insurgency, with deep roots and both nationalist and Islamist motivations, was gaining power throughout Iraq [citation needed] As the violence intensified in March, there was a distinct change in targeting from the coalition forces towards the new Iraqi Security Forces, as hundreds of Iraqi civilians and police were killed over the next few months in a series of massive bombings In the bloodiest day of the war since the start of combat operations, hundreds of Shi'a were killed when five bombs exploded on March 2 during Ashoura celebrations [167]\n\n\n2005: Elections and transitional government\nOn 31 January, Iraqis elected the Iraqi Transitional Government in order to draft a permanent constitution Although some violence and a widespread Sunni boycott marred the event, most of the eligible Kurd and Shia populace participated On 4 February, Paul Wolfowitz announced that 15,000 US troops whose tours of duty had been extended in order to provide election security would be pulled out of Iraq by the next month [195] February to April proved to be relatively peaceful months compared to the carnage of November and January, with insurgent attacks averaging 30 a day from the prior average of 70.\n\n\n2006: Civil war and permanent Iraqi government\nThe beginning of 2006 was marked by government creation talks, growing sectarian violence, and continuous anti-coalition attacks Sectarian violence expanded to a new level of intensity following the al-Askari Mosque bombing in the Iraqi city of Samarra, on 22 February 2006 The explosion at the mosque, one of the holiest sites in Shi'a Islam, is believed to have been caused by a bomb planted by al-Qaeda.\n\n\nIraq Study Group report and Saddam's execution\nThe Iraq Study Group Report was released on 6 December 2006 The Iraq Study Group made up of people from both of the major US parties, was led by co-chairs James Baker, a former Secretary of State (Republican), and Lee H Hamilton, a former US Representative (Democrat) It concluded that \"the situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating\" and \"US forces seem to be caught in a mission that has no foreseeable end.\" The report's 79 recommendations include increasing diplomatic measures with Iran and Syria and intensifying efforts to train Iraqi troops On 18 December, a Pentagon report found that insurgent attacks were averaging about 960 attacks per week, the highest since the reports had begun in 2005 [203]\n\n\n2007: US troops surge\nOn 10 January 2007, in a televised address to the US public, Bush proposed 21,500 more troops for Iraq, a job program for Iraqis, more reconstruction proposals, and $1.2 billion for these programs [206] On 23 January 2007, in the 2007 State of the Union Address, Bush announced he was \"deploying reinforcements of more than 20,000 additional soldiers and Marines to Iraq\".\n\n\nPlanned troop reduction\nIn a speech made to Congress on 10 September 2007, Petraeus \"envisioned the withdrawal of roughly 30,000 US troops by next summer, beginning with a Marine contingent  [in September].\" [214] On 13 September, Bush announced a limited withdrawal of troops from Iraq: [215] [216]\n\n\nEffects of the surge on security\nBy March 2008, violence in Iraq was reportedly curtailed by 40–80%, according to a Pentagon report [217] Independent reports [218] [219] raised questions about those assessments An Iraqi military spokesman claimed that civilian deaths since the start of the troop surge plan were 265 in Baghdad, down from 1,440 in the four previous weeks The New York Times counted more than 450 Iraqi civilians killed during the same 28‑day period, based on initial daily reports from Iraqi Interior Ministry and hospital officials.\n\n\nPolitical developments\nMore than half of the members of Iraq's parliament rejected the continuing occupation of their country for the first time 144 of the 275 lawmakers signed onto a legislative petition that would require the Iraqi government to seek approval from Parliament before it requests an extension of the UN mandate for foreign forces to be in Iraq, which expires at the end of 2008 It also calls for a timetable for troop withdrawal and a freeze on the size of foreign forces The UN Security Council mandate for US‑led forces in Iraq will terminate \"if requested by the government of Iraq.\" [240] 59% of those polled in the US support a timetable for withdrawal [241]\n\n\nTensions with Iran\nIn 2007, tensions increased greatly between Iran and Iraqi Kurdistan due to the latter's giving sanctuary to the militant Kurdish secessionist group Party for a Free Life in Kurdistan (PEJAK) According to reports, Iran had been shelling PEJAK positions in Iraqi Kurdistan since 16 August These tensions further increased with an alleged border incursion on 23 August by Iranian troops who attacked several Kurdish villages killing an unknown number of civilians and militants [243]\n\n\nTensions with Turkey\nBorder incursions by PKK militants based in Northern Iraq have continued to harass Turkish forces, with casualties on both sides In the fall of 2007, the Turkish military stated their right to cross the Iraqi Kurdistan border in \"hot pursuit\" of PKK militants and began shelling Kurdish areas in Iraq and attacking PKK bases in the Mount Cudi region with aircraft [245] [246] The Turkish parliament approved a resolution permitting the military to pursue the PKK in Iraqi Kurdistan [247] In November, Turkish gunships attacked parts of northern Iraq in the first such attack by Turkish aircraft since the border tensions escalated [248] Another series of attacks in mid-December hit PKK targets in the Qandil, Zap, Avashin and Hakurk regions The latest series of attacks involved at least 50 aircraft and artillery and Kurdish officials reported one civilian killed and two wounded [249]\n\n\nBlackwater private security controversy\nOn 17 September 2007, the Iraqi government announced that it was revoking the license of the US security firm Blackwater USA over the firm's involvement in the killing of eight civilians, including a woman and an infant, [251] in a firefight that followed a car bomb explosion near a State Department motorcade.\n\n\n2008: Civil war continues\nThroughout 2008, US officials and independent think tanks began to point to improvements in the security situation, as measured by key statistics According to the US Defense Department, in December 2008 the \"overall level of violence\" in the country had dropped 80% since before the surge began in January 2007, and the country's murder rate had dropped to prewar levels They also pointed out that the casualty figure for US forces in 2008 was 314 against a figure of 904 in 2007 [252]\n\n\nSpring offensives on Shiite militias\nAt the end of March, the Iraqi Army, with Coalition air support, launched an offensive, dubbed \"Charge of the Knights\", in Basra to secure the area from militias This was the first major operation where the Iraqi Army did not have direct combat support from conventional coalition ground troops The offensive was opposed by the Mahdi Army, one of the militias, which controlled much of the region [266] [267] Fighting quickly spread to other parts of Iraq: including Sadr City, Al Kut, Al Hillah and others During the fighting Iraqi forces met stiff resistance from militiamen in Basra to the point that the Iraqi military offensive slowed to a crawl, with the high attrition rates finally forcing the Sadrists to the negotiating table.\n\n\nCongressional testimony\nSpeaking before Congress on 8 April 2008, General David Petraeus urged delaying troop withdrawals, saying, \"I've repeatedly noted that we haven't turned any corners, we haven't seen any lights at the end of the tunnel,\" referencing the comments of then-President Bush and former Vietnam-era General William Westmoreland [269] When asked by the Senate if reasonable people could disagree on the way forward, Petraeus said, \"We fight for the right of people to have other opinions.\" [270]\n\n\nIraqi security forces rearm\nIraq became one of the top purchasers of US military equipment with their army trading its AK‑47 assault rifles for the US M‑16 and M‑4 rifles, among other equipment [272] In 2008 alone, Iraq accounted for more than $12.5 billion of the $34 billion US weapon sales to foreign countries (not including the potential F-16 fighter planes.) [273]\n\n\nStatus of forces agreement\nThe US–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement was approved by the Iraqi government on 4 December 2008 [277] It established that US combat forces would withdraw from Iraqi cities by 30 June 2009, and that all US forces would be completely out of Iraq by 31 December 2011 The pact was subject to possible negotiations which could have delayed withdrawal and a referendum scheduled for mid-2009 in Iraq, which might have required all US forces to completely leave by the middle of 2010 [278] [279] The pact required criminal charges for holding prisoners over 24 hours, and required a warrant for searches of homes and buildings that are not related to combat [280]\n\n\n2009: Coalition redeployment\nOn 1 January 2009, the United States handed control of the Green Zone and Saddam Hussein's presidential palace to the Iraqi government in a ceremonial move described by the country's prime minister as a restoration of Iraq's sovereignty Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said he would propose 1 January be declared national \"Sovereignty Day\" \"This palace is the symbol of Iraqi sovereignty and by restoring it, a real message is directed to all Iraqi people that Iraqi sovereignty has returned to its natural status\", al‑Maliki said [294]\n\n\nTransfer of the Green Zone\nOn 1 January 2009, the United States handed control of the Green Zone and Saddam Hussein's presidential palace to the Iraqi government in a ceremonial move described by the country's prime minister as a restoration of Iraq's sovereignty Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said he would propose 1 January be declared national \"Sovereignty Day\" \"This palace is the symbol of Iraqi sovereignty and by restoring it, a real message is directed to all Iraqi people that Iraqi sovereignty has returned to its natural status\", al‑Maliki said [294]\n\n\nProvincial elections\nOn 31 January, Iraq held provincial elections [296] Provincial candidates and those close to them faced some political assassinations and attempted assassinations, and there was also some other violence related to the election [297] [298] [299] [300]\n\n\nExit strategy announcement\nOn 27 February, United States President Barack Obama gave a speech at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in the US state of North Carolina announcing that the US combat mission in Iraq would end by 31 August 2010 A \"transitional force\" of up to 50,000 troops tasked with training the Iraqi Security Forces, conducting counterterrorism operations, and providing general support may remain until the end of 2011, the president added However, the insurgency in 2011 and the rise of ISIL in 2014 caused the war to continue [306]\n\n\nSixth anniversary protests\nOn 9 April, the 6th anniversary of Baghdad's fall to coalition forces, tens of thousands of Iraqis thronged Baghdad to mark the anniversary and demand the immediate departure of coalition forces The crowds of Iraqis stretched from the Sadr City slum in northeast Baghdad to the square around 5 km (3.1 mi) away, where protesters burned an effigy featuring the face of US President George W Bush [308] There were also Sunni Muslims in the crowd Police said many Sunnis, including prominent leaders such as a founding sheikh from the Sons of Iraq, took part [309]\n\n\nCoalition forces withdraw\nOn 30 April, the United Kingdom formally ended combat operations Prime Minister Gordon Brown characterized the operation in Iraq as a \"success story\" because of UK troops' efforts Britain handed control of Basra to the United States Armed Forces [310]\n\n\nIraq awards oil contracts\nOn 30 June and 11 December 2009, the Iraqi ministry of oil awarded contracts to international oil companies for some of Iraq's many oil fields The winning oil companies entered joint ventures with the Iraqi ministry of oil, and the terms of the awarded contracts included extraction of oil for a fixed fee of approximately $1.40 per barrel [312] [313] [314] The fees will only be paid once a production threshold set by the Iraqi ministry of oil is reached.\n\n\n2010: US drawdown and Operation New Dawn\nOn 17 February 2010, US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates announced that as of 1 September, the name \"Operation Iraqi Freedom\" would be replaced by \"Operation New Dawn\" [315]\n\n\nIraqi arms purchases\nAs US forces departed the country, the Iraq Defense Ministry solidified plans to purchase advanced military equipment from the United States Plans in 2010 called for $13 billion of purchases, to include 140 M1 Abrams main battle tanks [336] In addition to the $13 billion purchase, the Iraqis also requested 18 F-16 Fighting Falcons as part of a $4.2 billion program that also included aircraft training and maintenance, AIM‑9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, laser-guided bombs and reconnaissance equipment [337] All Abrams tanks were delivered by the end of 2011, [338] but the first F-16s did not arrive in Iraq until 2015, due to concerns that the Islamic State might overrun Balad Air Base [339]\n\n\nThe UN lifts restrictions on Iraq\nIn a move to legitimize the existing Iraqi government, the United Nations lifted the Saddam Hussein-era UN restrictions on Iraq These included allowing Iraq to have a civilian nuclear program, permitting the participation of Iraq in international nuclear and chemical weapons treaties, as well as returning control of Iraq's oil and gas revenue to the government and ending the Oil-for-Food Programme [342]\n\n\n2011: US withdrawal\nMuqtada al-Sadr returned to Iraq in the holy city of Najaf to lead the Sadrist movement after being in exile since 2007 [343]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe invasion and occupation led to sectarian violence, which caused widespread displacement among Iraqi civilians Since the beginning of the war, the first parliamentary elections were held in 2005 which brought greater representation and autonomy to Iraqi Kurds By 2007 the Iraqi Red Crescent estimated 2.3 million Iraqis were internally displaced, with an estimated 2 million Iraqis fleeing to neighboring countries, mostly to Syria and Jordan [360]\n\n\nEmerging conflict and insurgency\nThe invasion

for International and Public Affairs at Brown University [375] However, some economists argue the total cost to the U.S economy could range from $3 [376] to $6 trillion, including long-term interest and veterans' costs, by 2053 [377] The upper ranges of these estimates include the long-term cost of disability compensation and medical care to U.S troops Harvard's public finance expert, Linda J Bilmes, estimated that these costs alone would amount to nearly $1 trillion over the next 40 years [378] Bilmes also argued the war diverted resources from Afghanistan, raised oil prices, increased US federal debt, and contributed to the global financial crisis [379] The most recent estimates indicate costs will exceed $2.9 trillion by 2050 This figure includes direct costs such as military operations, veterans' care, and reconstruction, as well as long-term expenses, particularly for veterans' healthcare and disability benefits As of 2023, $1.8 trillion had been spent, and costs will continue over the coming decades due to care for veterans and other war-related expenditures [380]\n\n\nEconomic impact\nIn 2013, the total cost of the war to date was estimated at $1.7 trillion by

trillion had been spent, and costs will continue over the coming decades due to care for veterans and other war-related expenditures [380]\n\n\nReparations\nBy 2013, some human rights groups in both Iraq and the US had begun campaigning for reparations from the US for the devastation and health effects suffered by Iraqis during the war [384] [385]\n\n\nEconomic recession in 2021\nAs of 2021, Iraq had fallen into an economic depression, caused by the ongoing COVID pandemic and falling oil and gas prices, which economists described as the country's biggest financial threat since the rule of Saddam Hussein Iraq suffered from currency devaluation in 2021 for the first time in decades and was unable to import crucial products, including medicines and food, and had a lack of foreign currency to pay off the national debt [386]\n\n\nHumanitarian impact\nAccording to a 2007 Oxfam report, the child malnutrition rate had risen to 28%, and the rate of people without access to clean drinking water had risen to 70% [387] In 2007, Nasser Muhssin, a researcher on family and children's affairs affiliated to the University of Baghdad claimed that 60–70% of Iraqi children suffered from psychological problems [388] A 2007 cholera outbreak in northern Iraq was thought to be the result of poor water quality [389] As many as half of Iraqi doctors left the country between 2003 and 2006 [390]\n\n\nHumanitarian crisis\nAccording to a 2007 Oxfam report, the child malnutrition rate had risen to 28%, and the rate of people without access to clean drinking water had risen to 70% [387] In

cholera outbreak in northern Iraq was thought to be the result of poor water quality [389] As many as half of Iraqi doctors left the country between 2003 and 2006 [390]\n\n\nEnvironmental impact\nThe war has led to oil spills, which increased carbon emissions and contaminated the surrounding water resources During the invasion period, the retreating Iraqi army damaged the oil infrastructure and destroyed more than 736 oil wells in southern Iraq, resulting in massive oil spills and the ignition of fires [396] In 2003, more than 50 billion tonnes of carbon emissions were produced from burning oil fields and released into the atmosphere [397] Also, over 130 million gallons of oil leaked into surrounding water resources, such as Sawa Lake [398] Between 2003 and 2010, more than 5,000 birds from three species died around Sawa Lake [398]\n\n\nOil pollution\nThe war has led to oil spills, which increased carbon emissions and contaminated the surrounding water resources During the invasion period, the retreating Iraqi army damaged the oil infrastructure and destroyed more than 736 oil wells in southern Iraq, resulting in massive oil spills and the ignition of fires [396] In 2003, more than 50 billion tonnes of carbon emissions were produced from burning oil fields and released into the atmosphere [397] Also, over 130 million gallons of oil leaked into surrounding water resources, such as Sawa Lake [398] Between 2003 and 2010, more than 5,000 birds from three species died around Sawa Lake [398]\n\n\nRadioactive contamination\nThe U.S.-led coalition used depleted uranium (DU) munitions during the war to pierce tank armour [399] 1,000 to 2,000 tonnes (980 to 1,970 long tons; 1,100 to 2,200 short tons) of DU munitions were fired, which caused ammunition fragments containing radioactive material to spread across the country According to a United Nations Environment Programme report, radioactive material contaminated air and soil; with the radioactive concentration found in Iraqi soil at 709.52 Bq in 2003 compared to 143.22 Bq in 2002 [400] The report states that high levels of radiation prevented plants, especially crop seeds, from sprouting; with about 22% (9.5 million ha) of the farmland in Iraq unable to grow barley [398]\n\n\nEcosystem destruction\nThe war has also led to damage to ecosystems though pollution and physical destruction Approximately 25,000 tons of bombs were dropped by the U.S military during the war [396] More than 250 chemical and armament factories were destroyed, which caused over 50,000 cubic meters of hazardous chemicals, such as fertilizer, and raw sewage to leak into water, [405] leading to surrounding freshwater ecosystem becoming polluted and species' habitat being impacted [396] According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, 33 Iraqi wetlands, especially the Mesopotamian Marshland, have been contaminated by chemicals, which has caused 60 types of mammal species to lose their habitats, and more than 45 types of plants to become extinct [398]\n\n\nImpact on the Global War on Terrorism\nThough explicitly stating that Iraq had \"nothing\" to do with 9/11, [406] erstwhile President George W Bush consistently referred to the Iraq War as \"the central front in the War on Terror\", and argued that if the United States pulled out of Iraq, \"terrorists will follow us here\" [407] [408] [409] While other proponents of the war regularly echoed this assertion, as the conflict dragged on, members of the US Congress, the US public, and even US troops questioned the connection between Iraq and the fight against anti-US terrorism In particular, a consensus developed among intelligence experts that the Iraq War actually increased terrorism Counterterrorism expert Rohan Gunaratna frequently referred to the invasion of Iraq as a \"fatal mistake\" [410]\n\n\nImpact on geopolitics\nFrom a geopolitical perspective, the war in Iraq has been interpreted as weakening the West's moral high ground and hampering its ability to effectively counter Russia and China With regard to the Russo-Ukrainian War, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said in March 2022 that the U.S exerted similar pressures on Iraq in 2003, which the US invaded later for no reason other than \"a vial of unidentified chemicals\" [415] In March 2023, Tony Blair, former British prime minister rejected comparisons between Russia's war in Ukraine and the US-led invasion of Iraq, claiming that the Iraq War cannot be used as a justification by Russia to annex Russian-speaking zones in eastern Ukraine [416]\n\n\nCriticism\nThe Bush administration's rationale for the Iraq War has faced heavy criticism from an array of popular and official sources both inside and outside the United States, [418] [419] [350] with many US citizens finding many parallels with the Vietnam War [420] For example, a former CIA officer described the Office of Special Plans as a group of ideologues who were dangerous to US national security and a threat to world peace, and stated that the group lied and manipulated intelligence to further its agenda of removing Saddam [421] The Center for Public Integrity stated that the Bush administration made a total of 935 false statements between 2001 and 2003 about Iraq's alleged threat to the United States [422]\n\n\nWar crimes\nThroughout the war, many human rights abuses and war crimes were committed.\n\n\nBy Coalition forces and private contractors\nThe post-invasion Iraqi government used torture against detainees, including children Some techniques of torture used included beatings, electric shocks, prolonged hanging by the wrists, food and water deprivation, and blindfolding for multiple days [475] Iraqi police from the Interior Ministry were accused of forming Death Squads and committing numerous massacres of Sunni Arabs [476] Many of these human rights abuses were carried out by Iraqi government-sponsored Shi'ite militias [477]\n\n\nBy insurgent groups\nThe post-invasion Iraqi government used torture against detainees, including children Some techniques of torture used included beatings, electric shocks, prolonged hanging by the wrists, food and water deprivation, and blindfolding for multiple days [475] Iraqi police from the Interior Ministry were accused of forming Death Squads and committing numerous massacres of Sunni Arabs [476] Many

government-sponsored Shi'ite militias [477]\n\n\nPublic opinion on the war\nIn a March 2003 Gallup poll, the day after the invasion, 76% of Americans had approved of military action against Iraq [478] In a March 2003 YouGov poll, 54% of Britons supported the military action against Iraq [479] A remarkable aspect was the support for invasion expressed by many left-wing intellectuals such as Christopher Hitchens, Paul Berman, Michael Walzer and Jean Bethke Elshtain [480] [481] In a February 2003 poll by the national public research institute CIS, 91% of Spaniards opposed any military intervention in Iraq [482]\n\n\nInternational opinion\nIn a March 2003 Gallup poll, the day after the invasion, 76% of Americans had approved of military action against Iraq [478] In a March 2003

[482]\n\n\nIraqi opinion\nDirectly after the invasion, an NDTV poll of Baghdad residents reported a slight majority of respondents supported the US invasion [488] Polls conducted between 2005 and 2007 showed 31–37% of Iraqis wanted US and other Coalition forces to withdraw once security was restored and that 26–35% wanted immediate withdrawal instead [489] [490] [491] In 2006, a poll conducted on the Iraqi public revealed that 52% of the ones polled said Iraq was going in the right direction and 61% claimed it was worth ousting Saddam Hussein [489] In a March 2007 BBC poll, 82% of Iraqis expressed a lack of confidence in coalition forces based in Iraq [492] According to a 2009 poll conducted by the University of Maryland, 7 out of 10 Iraqis wanted US troops to withdraw within one year and also 78% felt that US military presence was \"provoking more conflict than it is preventing\" [493] Despite a majority having previously been opposed to the US presence, according to a poll conducted by the Asharq Research Centre, a private Iraqi company, 60% of Iraqis had believed it was \"the wrong time\" for a major withdrawal of American troops prior to the withdrawal in 2011, with 51% saying withdrawal would have a negative effect [494] [495]\n\n\nForeign involvement\nAccording to studies, most of the suicide bombers in Iraq were foreigners, especially Saudis [496] [497] [498]\n\n\nSuicide bombers\nAccording to studies, most of the suicide bombers in Iraq were foreigners, especially Saudis [496] [497] [498]\n\n\nRole of Iran\nAccording to two unnamed US officials, the Pentagon is examining the possibility that the Karbala provincial headquarters raid, in which insurgents managed to infiltrate an American base, kill five US soldiers, wound three, and destroy three humvees before fleeing, was supported by Iranians In a speech on 31 January 2007, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki stated that Iran was supporting attacks against Coalition forces in Iraq [499] and some Iraqis suspect that the raid may have been perpetrated by the Quds Force in retaliation for the detention of five Iranian officials by US forces in the northern Iraqi city of Irbil on 11 January [500] [501] In 2014, the legacy of Iran's presence in Iraq after the invasion had been mixed with regard to the fight against regional terrorist groups The U.S occupation and subsequent regional instability had spawned the creation of the PMF (Popular Mobilization Forces), an Iranian militia that effectively fought the influence of emerging caliphates in the region [502]\n\n\nRole of Israel\nIsrael did not officially support or take part in the Iraq War According to former State Department official Lawrence Wilkerson and former CIA agent and Iran expert Robert Baer, Israeli officials warned the Bush administration against invading Iraq, saying that it would destabilize the region and empower the much more dangerous regime in Iran [503] [504] [505] [506] However it was reported in the Washington Post that \"Israel is urging United States' officials not to delay a military strike against Iraq's Saddam Hussein\" [507] It was also reported in 2002 that Israeli intelligence provided Washington with alarming reports about Iraq's alleged program to develop weapons of mass destruction [508]\n\n\nRole of Russia\nThe invasion of Iraq prompted a widespread wave of criticism from several world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin [513] Before and during the invasion of Iraq, the Russian government provided intelligence to Saddam Hussein about the location of US forces and their plans [514]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "The_Big_Short_(film)", "content": "\nSynopsis\nThe film consists of three separate but concurrent stories, loosely connected by their actions in the years leading up to the 2007 housing market crash.\n\n\nScion Capital\nIn 2005, eccentric hedge fund manager Michael Burry discovers that the United States housing market, based on high-risk subprime loans, is extremely unstable Anticipating the market's collapse in the second quarter of 2007, as interest rates would rise from adjustable-rate mortgages, he proposes to create a credit default swap market, allowing him to bet against, or short, market-based mortgage-backed securities, for profit.\n\n\nFrontPoint Partners\nJared Vennett (based on Greg Lippmann), [8] the executive in charge of global asset-backed securities trading at Deutsche Bank, [9] is one of the first bankers to understand Burry's analysis, learning from one of the bankers who sold Burry an early credit default swap Using his quant to verify that Burry is most likely correct, he decides to enter the market and purchase credit default swaps himself However, his large monthly premiums result in him looking to reduce the size of his position by selling credit default swaps A misplaced phone call alerts FrontPoint Partners hedge fund manager Mark Baum (based on Steve Eisman), who is motivated to buy swaps from Vennett due to his low regard for banks' ethics and business models Vennett explains that the packaging of subprime loans into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) rated AAA will guarantee their eventual collapse.\n\n\nBrownfield Fund\nYoung investors Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley run a small firm called Brownfield Fund (based on the firm Cornwall Capital) They accidentally discover a marketing presentation by Vennett on a coffee table in the lobby of a large investment bank (the characters address the audience stating that in reality they had heard about Vennett's plan through word-of-mouth from friends and publications), convincing them to invest in swaps, as it fits their strategy of buying cheap insurance with big potential payouts Below the capital threshold for an ISDA Master Agreement required to enter into trades like Burry's and Baum's, they enlist the aid of Ben Rickert, a retired securities trader who was based in Singapore.\n\n\nEpilogue\nJared Vennett receives a bonus of $47 million for profits made on his credit default swaps Mark Baum becomes more gracious from the financial fallout, and his staff continue to operate their fund Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley go their separate ways after unsuccessfully trying to sue the ratings agencies, with Jamie still running the fund and Charlie moving to Charlotte to start a family Ben Rickert returns to his peaceful retirement Michael Burry closes his fund after public backlash and multiple IRS audits, now investing only in water securities.\n\n\nCast\nTracy Letts appears as Lawrence Fields, an investor in Burry's hedge fund, a fictional composite of Joel Greenblatt and others who had invested with Burry but came to disagree with his strategy Byron Mann appeared as Wing Chau, a CDO manager whom Baum interviews in Las Vegas, and Melissa Leo as Georgia Hale, an employee of Standard and Poor's based on Ernestine Warner, who admits to giving inaccurate ratings for bonds Adepero Oduye portrays Kathy Tao, an employee of Morgan Stanley, who oversees Baum's fund.\n\n\nProduction\nIn 2013, Paramount acquired the rights to the 2010 non-fiction book The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine by Michael Lewis, to develop it into a film, which Brad Pitt's Plan B Entertainment would produce [11] On March 24, 2014, Adam McKay was hired to write and direct a film about the housing and economic bubble [4] Screenwriter Charles Randolph, who co-wrote the film with McKay, said one of the first challenges was finding the right tone for the film He told Creative Screenwriting, \"In general it was trying to find the right tone that was slightly funnier than your average Miloš Forman comedy, which is all grounded character-based but not so satirical where you got Wag the Dog Somewhere between there was what I was shooting for Once I got the tone down, then I went through the plot The market's movements provided you with an underlying plot You make your short deal, then the bank is trying to squeeze you out, and then it all breaks loose So that was pretty easy, and it provided character arcs against that.\" [12] Two years after Randolph wrote his draft, McKay, as director, rewrote Randolph's screenplay It was McKay's idea to include the celebrity cameos in the film to explain the financial concepts [12]\n\n\nDevelopment\nIn 2013, Paramount acquired the rights to the 2010 non-fiction book

Block 1 Orion spacecraft, and a payload insertion of 50.7 tonnes (55.9 short tons; 112,000 lb) The plan was to rendezvous with an asteroid previously placed in lunar orbit by the robotic Asteroid Redirect Mission and have astronauts perform space-walks and gather samples [5] After the cancellation in April 2017 [6] of the Asteroid Redirect Mission, an 8-day mission was proposed with a crew of four astronauts, sent on a free-return trajectory around the Moon [7] Another proposal suggested in 2017 was to take four astronauts aboard Orion on an 8-to-21–day trip around the Moon to deliver the first element of the Deep Space Gateway [8] In March 2018, it was decided to launch the first Gateway module on a commercial launch vehicle [9] because of delays in building the Mobile Launcher needed to hold the more powerful Exploration Upper Stage [10] The launcher was selected to be the SpaceX Falcon Heavy [11]\n\n\nMission planning and launcher selection (2017–2021)\nIn 2017, Exploration

launcher was selected to be the SpaceX Falcon Heavy [11]\n\n\nHardware development, testing and integration (2021–present)\nOn February 11, 2023, NASA flipped the engine section for the Artemis II core to horizontal, the final major milestone before mating the section to the rest of the vehicle On March 20, the engine section was mated with the Artemis II core stage in Building 103 at the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans NASA expected the core stage, complete with engines, to be delivered to the Kennedy Space Center in summer 2023 [16] In May, the delivery date was moved to late fall 2023 [17] [18] The RS-25 engines with serial numbers E2047, E2059, E2062, and E2063 were installed on the core stage in New Orleans by September 25, 2023 [19] [20] Finally in June 2024, NASA announced the planned delivery of the fully outfitted core stage to KSC in July 2024, which was successfully carried out from the 16th to the 25th [21] [22] [23] The adapters needed for integration of the full vehicle also reached substantial completion in June 2024, and arrived at Kennedy Space Center in September 2024 [24] [25]\n\n\nLaunch date\nDuring preliminary reviews in 2011, the launch date was placed somewhere between 2019 and 2021, but afterwards the launch date was delayed to 2023 [30] [31] As of September 2024 [update], the mission is expected to launch no earlier than September 2025 [1] However, in October 2024, the NASA Office of Inspector General determined that the Exploration Ground Systems team had already used up their time reserved for resolving any unforeseen issues, leading the office to determine that the September 2025 launch date will likely be delayed [29]\n\n\nCrew\nArtemis II is to be crewed by four astronauts: Commander Reid Wiseman, Pilot Victor J Glover, Mission Specialist Christina Koch, and Mission Specialist Jeremy Hansen [32] On November 22, 2023, Jenni Gibbons was announced to be Hansen's backup; she will join the mission if Hansen is unable to [33] [34] On July 3, 2024, Andre Douglas was announced to be the backup for the three NASA astronauts [35] [36]\n\n\nMission\nThe Artemis II mission plan is to send four astronauts in the first crewed Orion MPCV spacecraft into a lunar flyby for a maximum of 21 days using the Block 1 variant of the Space Launch System The mission profile is a multi-trans-lunar injection (MTLI), or multiple departure burns, and includes a free-return trajectory from the Moon The Orion spacecraft will be sent to a high Earth orbit with a period of roughly 24 hours During this time the crew will perform various checkouts of the spacecraft's life support systems as well as an in-space rendezvous and proximity operations demonstration using the spent Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) as a target When Orion reaches perigee once again, it will fire its main engine to complete the TLI maneuver, which will send it to a lunar free-return trajectory, before returning to Earth [3] [38]\n\n\nOptical communications\nArtemis II will test and demonstrate optical communications to and from Earth using the Orion Artemis II Optical Communications System (O2O) [39] The O2O hardware will be integrated into the Orion spacecraft and includes an optical module (a 4-inch  [100 mm] telescope and two gimbals), modem and control electronics [39] O2O will communicate with ground stations in California and New Mexico [39] The test device will send data to Earth with a downlink rate of up to 260 megabits per second [40]\n\n\nTrajectory overview\nArtemis II's trajectory can be divided into several key phases: [41]\n\n\nLaunch\nIn December 1968, the Apollo 8 mission, crewed by astronauts Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and William Anders, flew their command and service module beyond low Earth orbit and completed ten orbits of the Moon Similar to the planned Artemis II mission in that it was crewed and did not land, it differed by being placed into orbit [42] Apollo 13 (1970) was the

"**Artemis 2**\n\nThe Artemis 2 mission is a planned crewed spaceflight mission by NASA, aiming to send astronauts around the Moon and return them safely to Earth. The mission is a crucial step in NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the lunar surface by 2025 and establish a sustainable presence on the Moon.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Artemis program was first proposed in 2017 as a follow-on to the Space Launch System (SLS) and Orion spacecraft development. Initially, the mission was planned as a single-launch mission, with a Space Launch System (SLS) Block 1B rocket and an Exploration Upper Stage, launching a lunar Block 1 Orion spacecraft and a payload insertion of 50.7 tonnes. The mission was to rendezvous with an asteroid previously placed in lunar orbit by the robotic Asteroid Redirect Mission and have astronauts perform space-walks and gather samples. However, the Asteroid Redirect Mission was cancelled in April 2017, and the Artemis 2 mission was redefined.\n\n**Mission Planning and Launcher Selection (2017-2021)**\n\nIn 2017, the mission planning focused on sending a crew of four astronauts on a free-return trajectory around the Moon. The mission profile included a multi-trans-lunar injection (MTLI), or multiple departure burns, and a lunar flyby. The Orion spacecraft would be sent to a high Earth orbit with a period of roughly 24 hours, where the crew would perform various checkouts of the spacecraft's life support systems and an in-space rendezvous and proximity operations demonstration using the spent Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) as a target.\n\nMeanwhile, the launcher selection process began, with the SpaceX Falcon Heavy being chosen to launch the first Gateway module in March 2018. The decision was made due to delays in building the Mobile Launcher needed to hold the more powerful Exploration Upper Stage.\n\n**Hardware Development, Testing, and Integration (2021-Present)**\n\nIn 2021, the Artemis 2 mission began to take shape, with the development of the core stage for the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket. The core stage was constructed at the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, where the four RS-25 engines were installed. The engine section was mated with the core stage in Building 103 at the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, marking a major milestone in the mission's progress. The rest of the vehicle, including the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) and the Orion spacecraft, was also being integrated and tested.\n\nIn June 2024, NASA announced the planned delivery of the fully outfitted core stage to the Kennedy Space Center, which was successfully carried out from July 16 to 25. The adapters needed for integration of the full vehicle also reached substantial completion in June 2024 and arrived at Kennedy Space Center in September 2024.\n\n**Launch Date**\n\nThe launch date for the Artemis 2 mission has been subject to change over the years. Initially, the mission was planned to launch between 2019 and 2021. However, the launch date was delayed to 2023, and as of September 2024, the mission is expected to launch no earlier than September 2025. However, in October 2024, the NASA Office of Inspector General determined that the Exploration Ground Systems team had already used up their time reserved for resolving any unforeseen issues, leading the office to determine that the September 2025 launch date will likely be delayed.\n\n**Crew**\n\nThe Artemis 2 mission will be crewed by four astronauts: Commander Reid Wiseman, Pilot Victor J Glover, Mission Specialist Christina Koch, and Mission Specialist Jeremy Hansen. Jenni Gibbons was announced to be Hansen's backup, and Andre Douglas was announced to be the backup for the three NASA astronauts.\n\n**Mission**\n\nThe Artemis 2 mission will send the Orion spacecraft on a free-return trajectory around the Moon, with the crew performing various checkouts of the spacecraft's life support systems and an in-space rendezvous and proximity operations demonstration using the spent Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) as a target. The mission will also test and demonstrate optical communications to and from Earth using the Orion Artemis II Optical Communications System (O2O).\n\n**Trajectory Overview**\n\nThe Artemis 2 mission can be divided into several key phases:\n\n1. **Launch**: The mission begins with the launch of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket from the Kennedy Space Center.\n2. **Earth Orbit and Systems Checkout**: The Orion spacecraft is sent to a high Earth orbit with a period of roughly 24 hours, where the crew performs various checkouts of the spacecraft's life support systems and an in-space rendezvous and proximity operations demonstration using the spent Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) as a target.\n3. **Translunar Injection**: The Orion spacecraft performs a multi-trans-lunar injection (MTLI), or multiple departure burns, to send it on a free-return trajectory around the Moon.\n4. **Lunar Flyby**: The Orion spacecraft flies by the Moon, performing a lunar flyby.\n5. **Return Trajectory**: The Orion spacecraft begins its return journey to Earth, using a lunar flyby as a gravity assist.\n6. **Re-entry and Splashdown**: The Orion spacecraft re-enters Earth's atmosphere and splashes down in the Pacific Ocean.\n\n**Similar Missions**\n\nThe Artemis 2 mission is similar to the Apollo 8 mission, which flew by the Moon in 1968. The mission is also similar to the Apollo 13 mission, which flew past the Moon by a free-return trajectory in 1970.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Artemis program\n* Space Launch System (SLS)\n* Orion

"prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Artemis_2\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nIn 2017, Exploration Mission-2 was a projected single-launch mission of a Space Launch System (SLS) Block 1B rocket with an Exploration Upper Stage, lunar Block 1 Orion spacecraft, and a payload insertion of 50.7 tonnes (55.9 short tons; 112,000 lb) The plan was to rendezvous with an asteroid previously placed in lunar orbit by the robotic Asteroid Redirect Mission and have astronauts perform space-walks and gather samples [5] After the cancellation in April 2017 [6] of the Asteroid Redirect Mission, an 8-day mission was proposed with a crew of four astronauts, sent on a free-return trajectory around the Moon [7] Another proposal suggested in 2017 was to take four astronauts aboard Orion on an 8-to-21–day trip around the Moon to deliver the first element of the Deep Space Gateway [8] In March 2018, it was decided to launch the first Gateway module on a commercial launch vehicle [9] because of delays in building the Mobile Launcher needed to hold the more powerful Exploration Upper Stage [10] The launcher was selected to be the SpaceX Falcon Heavy [11]\n\n\nMission planning and launcher selection (2017–2021)\nIn 2017, Exploration Mission-2 was a projected single-launch mission of a Space Launch System (SLS) Block 1B rocket with an Exploration Upper Stage, lunar Block 1 Orion spacecraft, and a payload insertion of 50.7 tonnes (55.9 short tons; 112,000 lb) The plan was to rendezvous with an asteroid previously placed in lunar orbit by the robotic Asteroid Redirect Mission and have astronauts perform space-walks and gather samples [5] After the cancellation in April 2017 [6] of the Asteroid Redirect Mission, an 8-day mission was proposed with a crew of four astronauts, sent on a free-return trajectory around the Moon [7] Another proposal suggested in 2017 was to take four astronauts aboard Orion on an 8-to-21–day trip around the Moon to deliver the first element of the Deep Space Gateway [8] In March 2018, it was decided to launch the first Gateway module on a commercial launch vehicle [9] because of delays in building the Mobile Launcher needed to hold the more powerful Exploration Upper Stage [10] The launcher was selected to be the SpaceX Falcon Heavy [11]\n\n\nHardware development, testing and integration (2021–present)\nOn February 11, 2023, NASA flipped the engine section for the Artemis II core to horizontal, the final major milestone before mating the section to the rest of the vehicle On March 20, the engine section was mated with the Artemis II core stage in Building 103 at the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans NASA expected the core stage, complete with engines, to be delivered to the Kennedy Space Center in summer 2023 [16] In May, the delivery date was moved to late fall 2023 [17] [18] The RS-25 engines with serial numbers E2047, E2059, E2062, and E2063 were installed on the core stage in New Orleans by September 25, 2023 [19] [20] Finally in June 2024, NASA announced the planned delivery of the fully outfitted core stage to KSC in July 2024, which was successfully carried out from the 16th to the 25th [21] [22] [23] The adapters needed for integration of the full vehicle also reached substantial completion in June 2024, and arrived at Kennedy Space Center in September 2024 [24] [25]\n\n\nLaunch date\nDuring preliminary reviews in 2011, the launch date was placed somewhere between 2019 and 2021, but afterwards the launch date was delayed to 2023 [30] [31] As of September 2024 [update], the mission is expected to launch no earlier than September 2025 [1] However, in October 2024, the NASA Office of Inspector General determined that the Exploration Ground Systems team had already used up their time reserved for resolving any unforeseen issues, leading the office to determine that the September 2025 launch date will likely be delayed [29]\n\n\nCrew\nArtemis II is to be crewed by four astronauts: Commander Reid Wiseman, Pilot Victor J Glover, Mission Specialist Christina Koch, and Mission Specialist Jeremy Hansen [32] On November 22, 2023, Jenni Gibbons was announced to be Hansen's backup; she will join the mission if Hansen is unable to [33] [34] On July 3, 2024, Andre Douglas was announced to be the backup for the three NASA astronauts [35] [36]\n\n\nMission\nThe Artemis II mission plan is to send four astronauts in the first crewed Orion MPCV spacecraft into a lunar flyby for a maximum of 21 days using the Block 1 variant of the Space Launch System The mission profile is a multi-trans-lunar injection (MTLI), or multiple departure burns, and includes a free-return trajectory from the Moon The Orion spacecraft will be sent to a high Earth orbit with a period of roughly 24 hours During this time the crew will perform various checkouts of the spacecraft's life support systems as well as an in-space rendezvous and proximity operations demonstration using the spent Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) as a target When Orion reaches perigee once again, it will fire its main engine to complete the TLI maneuver, which will send it to a lunar free-return trajectory, before returning to Earth [3] [38]\n\n\nOptical communications\nArtemis II will test and demonstrate optical communications to and from Earth using the Orion Artemis II Optical Communications System (O2O) [39] The O2O hardware will be integrated into the Orion spacecraft and includes an optical module (a 4-inch  [100 mm] telescope and two gimbals), modem and control electronics [39] O2O will communicate with ground stations in California and New Mexico [39] The test device will send data to Earth with a downlink rate of up to 260 megabits per second [40]\n\n\nTrajectory overview\nArtemis II's trajectory can be divided into several key phases: [41]\n\n\nLaunch\nIn December 1968, the Apollo 8 mission, crewed by astronauts Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and William Anders, flew their command and service module beyond low Earth orbit and completed ten orbits of the Moon Similar to the planned Artemis II mission in that it was crewed and did not land, it differed by being placed into orbit [42] Apollo 13 (1970) was the only Apollo mission, and only crewed spaceflight to date, that flew past the Moon by a free-return

{"title": "2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "content": "\nBackground\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991, the newly independent states of the Russian Federation and Ukraine maintained cordial relations In return for security guarantees, Ukraine signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1994, agreeing to dismantle the nuclear weapons the former USSR had left in Ukraine [21] At that time, Russia, the UK, and the USA agreed in the Budapest Memorandum to uphold Ukraine's territorial integrity [22] In 1999, Russia signed the Charter for European Security, affirming the right of each state \"to choose or change its security arrangements\" and to join alliances [23] In 2002, Putin said that Ukraine's relations with NATO were \"a matter for those two partners\" [24]\n\n\nPost-Soviet relations\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991, the newly independent states of the Russian Federation and Ukraine maintained cordial relations In return for security guarantees, Ukraine signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1994, agreeing to dismantle the nuclear weapons the former USSR had left in Ukraine [21] At that time, Russia, the UK, and the USA agreed in the Budapest Memorandum to uphold Ukraine's territorial integrity [22] In 1999, Russia signed the Charter for European Security, affirming the right of each state \"to

Russian intervention in Crimea and Donbas\nIn 2013, Ukraine's parliament overwhelmingly approved finalising an association agreement with the European Union (EU) [27] Russia had put pressure on Ukraine to reject it [28] Kremlin adviser Sergei Glazyev warned in September 2013 that if Ukraine signed the EU agreement, Russia would no longer acknowledge Ukraine's borders [29] In November, Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych suddenly withdrew from signing the agreement, [30] choosing closer ties to the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union instead This coerced withdrawal triggered a wave of protests known as Euromaidan, culminating in the Revolution of Dignity in February 2014 Yanukovych fled and was removed from power by parliament, ending up in Russia.\n\n\nPrelude\nThere was a large Russian military build-up near the Ukraine border in March and April 2021, [51] and again in both Russia and Belarus from October 2021 onward [52] Members of the Russian government, including Putin, repeatedly denied having plans to invade or attack Ukraine, with denials being issued up to the day before the invasion [53] [54] [55] The decision to invade Ukraine was reportedly made by Putin and a small group of war hawks or siloviki in Putin's inner circle, including national security adviser Nikolai Patrushev and defence minister Sergei Shoigu [56] Reports of an alleged leak of Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) documents by US intelligence sources said that the FSB had not been aware of Putin's plan to invade [57]\n\n\nPutin's invasion announcement\nOn 21 February, Putin announced that Russia recognized the Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine as independent states: the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic The following day, Russia announced that it was sending troops into these territories as \"peacekeepers\", [78] and the Federation Council of Russia authorised the use of military force abroad [79]\n\n\nEvents\nThe invasion began at dawn on 24 February [80] [85] It was described as the biggest attack on a European country and the first full-scale war in Europe [86] since the Second World War Russia launched a simultaneous ground and air attack [87] [88] Russian missiles struck targets throughout Ukraine, [89] and Russian troops invaded from the north, east, and south [90] Russia did not officially declare war [91] It was Russia's largest combined arms operation since the Soviet Union's Battle of Berlin in 1945 [citation needed] Fighting began in Luhansk Oblast at 3:40 a.m Kyiv time near Milove on the border with Russia [92] The main infantry and tank attacks were launched in four spearheads, creating a northern front launched towards Kyiv from Belarus, a southern front from Crimea, a southeastern front from Russian-controlled Donbas, and an eastern front from Russia towards Kharkiv and Sumy [93] Russian vehicles were subsequently marked with a white Z military symbol (a non-Cyrillic letter), believed to be a measure to prevent friendly fire [94]\n\n\nInitial invasion (24 February – 7 April)\nThe invasion began on 24 February, launched out of Belarus to target Kyiv, and from the northeast against the city of Kharkiv The southeastern front was conducted as two separate spearheads, from Crimea and the southeast against Luhansk and Donetsk.\n\n\nKyiv and northern front\nRussian efforts to capture Kyiv included a probative spearhead on 24 February, from Belarus south along the west bank of the Dnipro River The apparent intent was to encircle the city from the west, supported by two separate axes of attack from Russia along the east bank of the Dnipro: the western at Chernihiv, and from the east at Sumy These were likely intended to encircle Kyiv from the northeast and east [87] [88]\n\n\nNortheastern front\nRussian forces advanced into Chernihiv Oblast on 24 February, besieging its administrative capital within four days of fighting On 25 February Ukrainian forces lost control over Konotop [139] [140] As street fighting took place in the city of Sumy, just 35 kilometres (22 mi) from the Russo-Ukrainian border, Ukrainian forces claimed that on 28 February that 100 Russian armoured vehicles had been destroyed and dozens of soldiers captured following a Bayraktar TB2 drone and artillery attack on a large Russian column near Lebedyn in Sumy Oblast [141] Russian forces also attacked Okhtyrka, deploying thermobaric weapons [142]\n\n\nSouthern front\nOn 24 February, Russian forces took control of the North Crimean Canal, allowing Crimea to obtain water from the Dnieper, which had been cut off since 2014 [145] On 26 February, the siege of Mariupol began as the attack moved east linking to separatist-held Donbas [142] [146] En route, Russian forces entered Berdiansk and captured it [147] On 25 February, Russian units from the DPR were fighting near Pavlopil as they moved on Mariupol [148] By evening, the Russian Navy began an amphibious assault on the coast of the Sea of Azov 70 kilometres (43 mi) west of Mariupol A US defence official said that Russian forces were deploying thousands of marines from this beachhead [149]\n\n\nEastern front\nIn the east, Russian troops attempted to capture Kharkiv, less than 35 kilometres (22 mi) from the Russian border, [166] and met strong Ukrainian resistance On 25 February, the Millerovo air base was attacked by Ukrainian military forces with OTR-21 Tochka missiles, which according to Ukrainian officials, destroyed several Russian Air Force planes and started a fire [167] On 1 March, Denis Pushilin, head of the DPR, announced that DPR forces had almost completely surrounded the city of Volnovakha [168] On 2 March, Russian forces were repelled from Sievierodonetsk during an attack against the city [169] On the same day, Ukrainian forces initiated a counter-offensive on Horlivka, [170] controlled by the DPR [171] Izium was captured by Russian forces on 1 April [172] after a monthlong battle [173]\n\n\nSoutheastern front (8 April – 5 September)\nBy 17 April, Russian progress on the southeastern front appeared to be impeded by opposing Ukrainian forces in the large, heavily fortified Azovstal steel mill and surrounding area in Mariupol [179]\n\n\nFall of Mariupol\nOn 13 April, Russian forces intensified their attack on the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works in Mariupol, and the remaining Ukrainian personnel defending it [187] By 17 April, Russian forces had surrounded the factory Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal said that the Ukrainian soldiers had vowed to ignore the renewed ultimatum to surrender and to fight to the last soul [179] On 20 April, Putin said that the siege of Mariupol could be considered tactically complete, since the 500 Ukrainian troops entrenched in bunkers within the Azovstal iron works and estimated 1,000 Ukrainian civilians were completely sealed off from any type of relief [188]\n\n\nFall of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk\nA Russian missile attack on Kramatorsk railway station in the city of Kramatorsk took place on 8 April, reportedly killing at least 52 people [200] and injuring as many as 87 to 300 [201] On 11 April, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine expected a major new Russian offensive in the east [202] American officials said that Russia had withdrawn or been repulsed elsewhere in Ukraine, and therefore was preparing a retraction, resupply, and redeployment of infantry and tank divisions to the southeastern Ukraine front [203] [204] Military satellites photographed extensive Russian convoys of infantry and mechanised units deploying south from Kharkiv to Izium on 11 April, apparently part of the planned Russian redeployment of its northeastern troops to the southeastern front of the invasion [205]\n\n\nKharkiv front\nOn 14 April, Ukrainian troops reportedly blew up a bridge between Kharkiv and Izium used by Russian forces to redeploy troops to Izium, impeding the Russian convoy [222]\n\n\nKherson-Mykolaiv front\nMissile attacks and bombardment of the key cities of Mykolaiv and Odesa continued as the second phase of the invasion began [180] On 22 April 2022, Russia's Brigadier General Rustam Minnekayev in a defence ministry meeting said that Russia planned to extend its Mykolaiv–Odesa front after the siege of Mariupol further west to include the breakaway region of Transnistria on the Ukrainian border with Moldova [225] The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine called this plan imperialism and said that it contradicted previous Russian claims that it did not have territorial ambitions in Ukraine and also that the statement admitted that \"the goal of the 'second phase' of the war is not victory over the mythical Nazis, but simply the occupation of eastern and southern Ukraine.\" [225] Georgi Gotev of EURACTIV noted on 22 April that Russian occupation from Odesa to Transnistria would transform Ukraine into a landlocked nation with no practical access to the Black Sea [226] Russia resumed its missile strikes on Odesa on 24 April, destroying military facilities and causing two dozen civilian casualties [227]\n\n\nZaporizhzhia front\nAn IAEA delegation visited the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on 3 September, and on 6 September reported damage and security threats caused by external shelling and the presence of occupying troops in the plant [255] On 11 September, at 3:14 a.m., the sixth and final reactor was disconnected from the grid, \"completely stopping\" the plant Energoatom said that preparations were \"underway for its cooling and transfer to a cold state.\" [256]\n\n\nRussian annexations and occupation losses (6 September – 11 November 2022)\nOn 6 September 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a surprise counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region, beginning near Balakliia, led by General Syrskyi [246] An emboldened Kyiv launched a counteroffensive 12 September around Kharkiv successful enough to make Russia admit losing key positions and for The New York Times to say that it dented the image of a \"Mighty Putin\" Kyiv sought more arms from the West to sustain the counteroffensive [247] On 21 September 2022, Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilisation and Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu said 300,000 reservists would be called [248] He also said that his country would use \"all means\" to \"defend itself.\" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, said that the decision was predictable and that it was an attempt to justify \"Russia's failures.\" [249] British Foreign Office Minister Gillian Keegan called the situation an \"escalation\", [250] while former Mongolian president Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj accused Russia of using Russian Mongols as \"cannon fodder.\" [251]\n\n\nRussian annexation of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts\nIn late September 2022, Russian-installed officials in Ukraine organised referendums on the annexation of the occupied territories of Ukraine These included the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic in Russian-occupied Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine, as well as the Russian-appointed military administrations of Kherson Oblast and Zaporizhzhia Oblast Denounced by Ukraine's government and its allies as sham elections, the elections' official results showed overwhelming majorities in favour of annexation [252]\n\n\nZaporizhzhia front\nAn IAEA delegation visited the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on 3 September, and on 6 September reported damage and security threats caused by external shelling and the presence of occupying troops in the plant [255] On 11 September, at 3:14 a.m., the sixth and final reactor was disconnected from the grid, \"completely stopping\" the plant Energoatom said that preparations were \"underway for its cooling and transfer to a cold state.\" [256]\n\n\nKherson counteroffensive\nOn 29 August, Zelenskyy advisedly vowed the start of a full-scale counteroffensive in the southeast He first announced a counteroffensive to retake Russian-occupied territory in the south concentrating on the Kherson-Mykolaiv region, a claim that was corroborated by the Ukrainian parliament as well as Operational Command South [258]\n\n\nKharkiv counteroffensive\nUkrainian forces launched another surprise counteroffensive on 6 September in the Kharkiv Oblast near Balakliia led by General Syrskyi [246] By 7 September, Ukrainian forces had advanced some 20 kilometres (12 mi) into Russian occupied territory and claimed to have recaptured approximately 400 square kilometres (150 sq mi) Russian commentators said this was likely due to the relocation of Russian forces to Kherson in response to the Ukrainian offensive there [266] On 8 September, Ukrainian forces captured Balakliia and advanced to within 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) of Kupiansk [267] Military analysts said Ukrainian forces appeared to be moving towards Kupiansk, a major railway hub, with the aim of cutting off the Russian forces at Izium from the north [268]\n\n\nWinter stalemate, attrition campaign and military surge (12 November 2022 – 7 June 2023)\nAfter the end of the twin Ukrainian counteroffensives, the fighting shifted to a semi-deadlock during the winter, [276] with heavy casualties but reduced motion of the frontline [277] Russia launched a self-proclaimed winter offensive in eastern Ukraine, but the campaign ended in \"disappointment\" for Moscow, with limited gains as the offensive stalled [276] [278] Analysts variously blamed the failure on Russia's lack of \"trained men\", and supply problems with artillery ammunition, among other problems [276] [278] Near the end of May, Mark Galeotti assessed that \"after Russia's abortive and ill-conceived winter offensive, which squandered its opportunity to consolidate its forces, Ukraine is in a relatively strong position.\" [279]\n\n\nBattle of Bakhmut\nFollowing defeat in Kherson and Kharkiv, Russian and Wagner forces focused on taking the city of Bakhmut and breaking the half year long stalemate that prevailed there since the start of the war Russian forces sought to encircle the city, attacking from the north via Soledar After taking heavy casualties, Russian and Wagner forces took control of Soledar on 16 January 2023 [285] [286] By early February 2023, Bakhmut was facing attacks from north, south and east, with the sole Ukrainian supply lines coming from Chasiv Yar to the west [287]\n\n\n2023 counteroffensives and summer campaign (8 June 2023 – 1 December 2023)\nIn June 2023, Ukrainian forces gradually launched a series of counteroffensives on multiple fronts, including Donetsk Oblast, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, and others [297] On 8 June 2023, counteroffensive efforts focused near settlements such as Orikhiv, Tokmak, and Bakhmut [298] However, counteroffensive operations faced stiff resistance from Russia, [299] and the American think tank Institute for the Study of War described the Russian defensive effort as having \"an uncharacteristic degree of coherency.\" [300] By 12 June, Ukraine reported its fastest advance in seven months, claiming to have liberated several villages and advanced a total of 6.5 km Russian military bloggers also reported that Ukraine had taken Blahodatne, Makarivka and Neskuchne, and were continuing to push southward [301] Ukraine continued to liberate settlements over the next few months, raising the Ukrainian flag over the settlement of Robotyne in late August [302]\n\n\nRussian spring and summer campaigns and Ukrainian incursion (1 December 2023 – present)\nOn 17 February 2024, Russia captured Avdiivka, a longtime stronghold for Ukraine that had been described as a \"gateway\" to nearby Donetsk [325] [326] [327] ABC News stated that Russia could use the development to boost morale with the war largely at a stalemate close to its second anniversary [328] Described by Forbes journalist David Axe as a pyrrhic Russian victory, the Russian 2nd and 41st Combined Arms Armies ended up with 16,000 men killed, tens of thousands wounded and around 700 vehicles lost before seizing the ruins of Avdiivka [329]\n\n\nRussian offensive\nOn 17 February 2024, Russia captured Avdiivka, a longtime stronghold for Ukraine that had been described as a \"gateway\" to nearby Donetsk [325] [326] [327] ABC News stated that Russia could use the development to boost morale with the war largely at a stalemate close to its second anniversary [328] Described by Forbes journalist David Axe as a pyrrhic Russian victory, the Russian 2nd and 41st Combined Arms Armies ended up with 16,000 men killed, tens of thousands wounded and around 700 vehicles lost before seizing the ruins of Avdiivka [329]\n\n\nUkrainian offensive into Russia\nOn 6 August 2024, Ukraine launched their first direct offensive into Russian territory, the largest of any pro-Ukrainian incursion since the invasion's inception, into the bordering Kursk Oblast [348] The main axis of the initial advance centred in the direction of the town of Sudzha, located 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from the border, [349] which was reported by President Zelenskyy to have been captured on 15 August [350] Ukraine, taking advantage of the lack of experienced units and defenses along the border with Kursk Oblast, was able to quickly seize territory in the opening days of the incursion [351] The incursion caused Russia to divert thousands of troops from occupied Ukrainian territory to counter the threat, [352] [353] though not from Donetsk Oblast [353]\n\n\nRussian Donbas advances\nRussian troops continued advancing in eastern Ukraine, notably at a faster pace than prior to the Kursk offensive, [354] including towards the strategically important city of Pokrovsk, where their number of forces had instead been increased [355] [356] [357]\n\n\nBattlespaces\nThe supreme commanders-in-chief are the heads of state of the respective governments: President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine Putin has reportedly meddled in operational decisions, bypassing senior commanders and giving orders directly to brigade commanders [365]\n\n\nCommand\nThe supreme commanders-in-chief are the heads of state of the respective governments: President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine Putin has reportedly meddled in operational decisions, bypassing senior commanders and giving orders directly to brigade commanders [365]\n\n\nMissile attacks and aerial warfare\nAerial warfare began the first day of the invasion Dozens of missile attacks were recorded across both eastern and western Ukraine, [87] [88] reaching as far west as Lviv [167]\n\n\nCrimea attacks\nOn 31 July 2022, Russian Navy Day commemorations were cancelled after a drone attack reportedly wounded several people at the Russian Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Sevastopol [376] On 9 August 2022, large explosions were reported at Saky Air Base in western Crimea Satellite imagery showed at least eight aircraft damaged or destroyed Initial speculation attributed the explosions to long-range missiles, sabotage by special forces or an accident; [377] Ukrainian general Valerii Zaluzhnyi claimed responsibility on 7 September [378]\n\n\nRussian attacks against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure\nSince fall of 2022, Russia has carried out waves of strikes on Ukrainian electrical and water systems [384] On 6 October the Ukrainian military reported that 86 Shahed 136 kamikaze drones had been launched by Russian forces in total, and between 30 September and 6 October Ukrainian forces had destroyed 24 out of 46 launched in that period [385] On 8 October, it was announced that General of the Army Sergey Surovikin would be commanding all Russian forces in Ukraine on the strength of his novel air assault technique [386]\n\n\nNaval blockade and engagements\nUkraine lies on the Black Sea, which has ocean access only through the Turkish-held Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits On 28 February, Turkey invoked the 1936 Montreux Convention and sealed off the straits to Russian warships that were not registered to Black Sea home bases and returning to their ports of origin It specifically denied passage through the Turkish Straits to four Russian naval vessels [405] On 24 February, the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine announced that Russian Navy ships had begun an attack on Snake Island [406] The guided missile cruiser Moskva and patrol boat Vasily Bykov bombarded the island with deck guns [407] The Russian warship identified itself and instructed the Ukrainians on the island to surrender Their response was \"Russian warship, go fuck yourself!\" [408] After the bombardment, a detachment of Russian soldiers landed and took control of Snake Island [409] Russia said on 26 February that US drones had supplied intelligence to the Ukrainian navy to help it target Russian warships in the Black Sea The US denied this [410]\n\n\nUkrainian resistance\nUkrainian civilians resisted the Russian invasion by volunteering for territorial defence units, making Molotov cocktails, donating food, building barriers like Czech hedgehogs, [434] and helping to transport refugees [435] Responding to a call from Ukravtodor, Ukraine's transportation agency, civilians dismantled or altered road signs, [436] constructed makeshift barriers, and blocked roadways [437] Social media reports showed spontaneous street protests against Russian forces in occupied settlements, often evolving into verbal altercations and physical standoffs with Russian troops [438] By the beginning of April, Ukrainian civilians began to organise as guerrillas, mostly in the wooded north and east of the country The Ukrainian military announced plans for a large-scale guerrilla campaign to complement its conventional defence [439]\n\n\nForeign involvement\nIn response to the invasion, many countries have supplied military aid to Ukraine including weaponry, equipment, training, and logistical support Western and other countries imposed limited sanctions on Russia in the prelude to the invasion and applied new sanctions when the invasion began, intending to cripple the Russian economy; [446] [447] sanctions targeted individuals, banks, businesses, monetary exchanges, exports, and imports [446]\n\n\nSupport for Ukraine\nIn response to the invasion, many countries have supplied military aid to Ukraine including weaponry, equipment, training, and logistical support Western and other countries imposed limited sanctions on Russia in the prelude to the invasion and applied new sanctions when the invasion began, intending to cripple the Russian economy; [446] [447] sanctions targeted individuals, banks, businesses, monetary exchanges, exports, and imports [446]\n\n\nSupport for Russia\nBelarus has allowed Russia to use its territory to stage part of the invasion, and to launch Russian missiles into Ukraine [462] Belarus airspace was used by Russia, including for radar early warning and control missions, until 2023, when a Russian Beriev A-50 surveillance plane was damaged by drones [463] Because of its active involvement, Belarus is considered a co-belligerent [464] [465] (but not a co-combatant [466]) in this invasion, as contrasted to non-belligerent states, which have \"a wide range of tools available to non-belligerent actors without reaching the threshold of warfighting\" [467]\n\n\nCasualties\nRussian and Ukrainian sources have both been said to inflate the casualty numbers for opposing forces and downplay their own losses for the sake of morale [497] Leaked US documents say that \"under-reporting of casualties within the  [Russian] system highlights the military's 'continuing reluctance' to convey bad news up the chain of command.\" [498] Russian news outlets have largely stopped reporting the Russian death toll [499] Russia and Ukraine have admitted suffering \"significant\" [500] and \"considerable\" losses, respectively [501] [502]\n\n\nPrisoners of war\nOfficial and estimated numbers of prisoners of war (POW) have varied [549] On 24 February, Oksana Markarova, Ukraine's ambassador to the US, said that a platoon of the 74th Guards from Kemerovo Oblast had surrendered, saying they were unaware that they had been brought to Ukraine and ordered to kill Ukrainians [550] Russia claimed to have captured 572 Ukrainian soldiers as of 2 March 2022, [551] while Ukraine said it held 562 Russian soldiers as of 20 March [552] It also released one soldier for five of its own and exchanged another nine for the detained mayor of Melitopol [553]\n\n\nWar crimes and attacks on civilians\nDuring the invasion, the Russian military and authorities have been responsible for deliberate attacks against civilian targets [565] (including strikes on hospitals and on the energy grid), massacres of civilians, abduction and torture of civilians, sexual violence, [566] forced deportation of civilians, and torture and murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war They have also carried out many indiscriminate attacks in densely populated areas, including with cluster bombs [567] [568] [569]\n\n\nAbduction of Ukrainian children\nIn June 2024, an investigation by the Financial Times identified four Ukrainian children on a Russian government-linked adoption website that had been abducted from state care homes The children's Ukrainian background was not mentioned One child was shown with a new Russian name and age that differed from their Ukrainian documents, another was shown using a Russian version of their Ukrainian name 17 additional matches identified by the Financial Times on the adoption website were also confirmed as Ukrainian children in a recent New York Times investigation Ukrainian authorities estimate that nearly 20,000 Ukrainian children have been forcibly taken from occupied territories to Russia since the full-scale invasion began Wayne Jordash, president of humanitarian law firm Global Rights Compliance, described forcibly transferring or deporting children as war crimes, adding that when done as part of a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population, Russia is also committing crimes against humanity [577] [578]\n\n\nInternational arrest warrants\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) opened an investigation into possible crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes [579] On 17 March 2023 the ICC issued a warrant for Putin's arrest, charging him with individual criminal responsibility in the abduction of children forcibly deported to Russia [580] It was the first time that the ICC had issued an arrest warrant for the head of state of a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council [580] (the world's five principal nuclear powers) [581] Moscow has denied any involvement in war crimes, a response Vittorio Bufacchi of University College Cork says \"has bordered on the farcical,\" [582] and its contention that the images coming out of Bucha were fabricated \"a disingenuous response born by delusional hubris, post-truth on overdrive, (that) does not merit to be taken seriously.\" Even the usually fractured United States Senate came together to call Putin a war criminal [583]\n\n\nImpacts\nThe humanitarian impact of the invasion has been extensive and has included negative impacts on international food supplies and the 2022 food crises [588] An estimated 6.6 million Ukrainians were internally displaced by August 2022, and about the same number were refugees in other countries [589] The invasion has devastated the cultural heritage of Ukraine, [590] with over 500 Ukrainian cultural heritage sites, including cultural centres, theatres, museums, and churches, affected by \"Russian aggression.\" Ukraine's Minister of Culture called it cultural genocide [591] Deliberate destruction and looting of Ukrainian cultural heritage sites in this way is considered a war crime [592]\n\n\nHumanitarian impact\nThe humanitarian impact of the invasion has been extensive and has included negative impacts on international food supplies and the 2022 food crises [588] An

humanitarian crisis in Europe since the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s; [596] [597] the UN described it as the fastest growing such crisis since World War II [598] As Russia built up military forces along the Ukrainian border, many neighbouring governments and aid organisations prepared for a mass displacement event in the weeks before the invasion In December 2021, the Ukrainian defence minister estimated that an invasion could force three to five million people to flee their homes [599]\n\n\nLong-term demographic effects\nBoth Russia and Ukraine faced the prospect of significant population decline even before the war, having among the lowest fertility rates worldwide and considerable emigration It is the first time that two countries with an average age above 40 have gone to war against each other [619] Russia had a fighting-age (18- to 40-year-old) male population more than four times higher than Ukraine's and slightly higher birth rates, while the willingness to fight was more pronounced in Ukraine [620]\n\n\nEnvironmental impact\nBased on a preliminary assessment, the war has inflicted USD 51 billion in environmental damage in Ukraine; according to a report by the Yale School of the Environment, some 687,000 tons of petrochemicals have burned as a result of shelling, while nearly 1,600 tons of pollutants have leaked into bodies of water Hazardous chemicals have contaminated around 70 acres of soil, and likely made agricultural activities temporarily impossible [635] Around 30% of Ukraine's land is now littered with explosives and more than 2.4 million hectares of forest have been damaged [636]\n\n\nNuclear risk\nSenior Russian politicians—including Putin, Sergey Lavrov, and Dmitry Medvedev—have made statements widely seen as nuclear blackmail They have implied that Russia may use nuclear weapons if certain \"red lines\" are crossed, such as helping Ukraine to strike back at Russia itself.\n\n\nEconomic impact\nUkrainian Minister of Economic Development and Trade Yulia Svyrydenko announced that for 2022 Ukraine had a 30.4% loss in their GDP [655] The International Monetary Fund predicted that Ukraine's gross domestic product (GDP) would suffer a decrease from a minimum of 10% to a maximum of 35%; [656] the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development also predicted that the invasion would cause a 20% decrease of Ukraine's GDP [657] However, the Ukrainian statistics service said that the GDP of Ukraine in 2023 grew by 5.3% [658]\n\n\nUkraine\nUkrainian Minister of Economic Development and Trade Yulia Svyrydenko announced

intergovernmental organisations [696] On 2 March 2022 and on 23 February 2023, 141 member states of the UN General Assembly voted for a resolution saying that Russia should immediately withdraw Seven, including Russia, voted against the measure [697] Political reactions to the invasion included new sanctions imposed on Russia, which triggered widespread economic effects on the Russian and world economies [698] Sanctions forced Russia to reorient its oil exports to non-sanctioning countries such as India, rely more on LNG (which was not subject to European Union sanctions), and shift its coal exports from Europe to Asia [699] Most European countries cancelled nuclear cooperation with Russia [700]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal

began on 24 February 2022. The invasion was preceded by a long-standing conflict between the two countries, dating back to the annexation of Crimea in 2014.\n\n**Background**\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991, the newly independent states of the Russian Federation and Ukraine maintained cordial relations. In return for security guarantees, Ukraine signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1994, agreeing to dismantle the nuclear weapons the former USSR had left in Ukraine. At that time, Russia, the UK, and the USA agreed in the Budapest Memorandum to uphold Ukraine's territorial integrity. In 1999, Russia signed the Charter for European Security, affirming the right of each state \"to choose or change its security arrangements\" and to join alliances. In 2002, Putin said that Ukraine's relations with NATO were \"a matter for those two partners\".\n\n**Ukrainian revolution, Russian intervention in Crimea and Donbas**\n\nIn 2013, Ukraine's parliament overwhelmingly approved finalising an association agreement with the European Union (EU). Russia had put pressure on Ukraine to reject it. Kremlin adviser Sergei Glazyev warned in September 2013 that if Ukraine signed the EU agreement, Russia would no longer acknowledge Ukraine's borders. In November, Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych suddenly withdrew from signing the agreement, choosing closer ties to the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union instead. This coerced withdrawal triggered a wave of protests known as Euromaidan, culminating in the Revolution of Dignity in February 2014. Yanukovych fled and was removed from power by parliament, ending up in Russia.\n\n**Prelude**\n\nThere was a large Russian military build-up near the Ukraine border in March and April 2021. Members of the Russian government, including Putin, repeatedly denied having plans to invade or attack Ukraine, with denials being issued up to the day before the invasion. The decision to invade Ukraine was reportedly made by Putin and a small group of war hawks or siloviki in Putin's inner circle, including national security adviser Nikolai Patrushev and defence minister Sergei Shoigu. Reports of an alleged leak of Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) documents by US intelligence sources said that the FSB had not been aware of Putin's plan to invade.\n\n**Putin's invasion announcement**\n\nOn 21 February, Putin announced that Russia recognized the Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine as independent states: the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic. The following day, Russia announced that it was sending troops into these territories as \"peacekeepers\", and the Federation Council of Russia authorized the use of military force abroad.\n\n**Events**\n\nThe invasion began at dawn on 24 February. It was described as the biggest attack on a European country and the first full-scale war in Europe since the Second World War. Russia launched a simultaneous ground and air attack. Russian missiles struck targets throughout Ukraine, and Russian troops invaded from the north, east, and south. Russia did not officially declare war. It was Russia's largest combined arms operation since the Soviet Union's Battle of Berlin in 1945. Fighting began in Luhansk Oblast at 3:40 am Kyiv time near Milove on the border with Russia. The main infantry and tank attacks were launched in four spearheads, creating a northern front launched towards Kyiv from Belarus, a southern front from Crimea, a southeastern front from Russian-controlled Donbas, and an eastern front from Russia towards Kharkiv and Sumy. Russian vehicles were subsequently marked with a white Z military symbol, believed to be a measure to prevent friendly fire.\n\n**Initial invasion (24 February – 7 April)**\n\nThe invasion began on 24 February, launched out of Belarus to target Kyiv, and from the northeast against the city of Kharkiv. The southeastern front was conducted as two separate spearheads, from Crimea and the southeast against Luhansk and Donetsk. Russian efforts to capture Kyiv included a probative spearhead on 24 February, from Belarus south along the west bank of the Dnipro River. The apparent intent was to encircle the city from the west, supported by two separate axes of attack from Russia along the east bank of the Dnipro: the western at Chernihiv, and from the east at Sumy. These were likely intended to encircle Kyiv from the northeast and east.\n\n**Kyiv and northern front**\n\nRussian forces advanced into Chernihiv Oblast on 24 February, besieging its administrative capital within four days of fighting. On 25 February, Ukrainian forces lost control over Konotop. As street fighting took place in the city of Sumy, just 35 kilometres (22 mi) from the Russo-Ukrainian border, Ukrainian forces claimed that on 28 February that 100 Russian armoured vehicles had been destroyed and dozens of soldiers captured following a Bayraktar TB2 drone and artillery attack on a large Russian column near Lebedyn in Sumy Oblast. Russian forces also attacked Okhtyrka, deploying thermobaric weapons.\n\n**Southern front**\n\nOn 24 February, Russian forces took control of the North Crimean Canal, allowing Crimea to obtain water from the Dnieper, which had been cut off since 2014. On 26 February, the siege of Mariupol began as the attack moved east linking to separatist-held Donbas. En route, Russian forces entered Berdiansk and captured it. On 25 February, Russian units from the DPR were fighting near Pavlopil as they moved on Mariupol. By evening, the Russian Navy began an amphibious assault on the coast of the Sea of Azov 70 kilometres (43 mi) west of Mariupol. A US defence official said that Russian forces were deploying thousands of marines from this beachhead.\n\n**Eastern front**\n\nIn the east, Russian troops attempted to capture Kharkiv, less than 35 kilometres (22 mi) from the Russian border. On 25 February, the Millerovo air base was attacked by Ukrainian military forces with OTR-21 Tochka missiles, which according to Ukrainian officials, destroyed several Russian Air Force planes and started a fire. On 1 March, Denis Pushilin, head of the DPR, announced that DPR forces had almost completely surrounded the city of Volnovakha. On 2 March, Russian forces were repelled from Sievierodonetsk during an attack against the city. On the same day, Ukrainian forces initiated a counter-offensive on Horlivka, controlled by the DPR. Izium was captured by Russian forces on 1 April after a monthlong battle.\n\n**Southeastern front (8 April – 5 September)**\n\nBy 17 April, Russian progress on the southeastern front appeared to be impeded by opposing Ukrainian forces in the large, heavily fortified Azovstal steel mill and surrounding area in Mariupol. On 13 April, Russian forces intensified their attack on the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works in Mariupol, and the remaining Ukrainian personnel defending it. By 17 April, Russian forces had surrounded the factory. Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal said that the Ukrainian soldiers had vowed to ignore the renewed ultimatum to surrender and to fight to the last soul.\n\n**Fall of Mariupol**\n\nOn 20 April, Putin said that the siege of Mariupol could be considered tactically complete, since the 500 Ukrainian troops entrenched in bunkers within the Azovstal iron works and estimated 1,000 Ukrainian civilians were completely sealed off from any type of relief. The fall of Mariupol marked a significant victory for Russia, but at a high cost in terms of lives and resources.\n\n**Battle of Bakhmut**\n\nFollowing defeat in Kherson and Kharkiv, Russian and Wagner forces focused on taking the city of Bakhmut and breaking the half-year-long stalemate that prevailed there since the start of the war. Russian forces sought to encircle the city, attacking from the north via Soledar. After taking heavy casualties, Russian and Wagner forces took control of Soledar on 16 January 2023. By early February 2023, Bakhmut was facing attacks from north, south, and east, with the sole Ukrainian supply lines coming from Chasiv Yar to the west.\n\n**2023 counteroffensives and summer campaign (8 June 2023 – 1 December 2023)**\n\nIn June 2023, Ukrainian forces gradually launched a series of counteroffensives on multiple fronts, including Donetsk Oblast, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, and others. On 8 June 2023, counteroffensive efforts focused near settlements such as Orikhiv, Tokmak, and Bakhmut. However, counteroffensive operations faced stiff resistance from Russia, and the American think tank Institute for the Study of War described the Russian defensive effort as having \"an uncharacteristic degree of coherency.\" By 12 June, Ukraine reported its fastest advance in seven months, claiming to have liberated several villages and advanced a total of 6.5 km. Ukraine continued to liberate settlements over the next few months, raising the Ukrainian flag over the settlement of Robotyne in late August.\n\n**Russian spring and summer campaigns and Ukrainian incursion (1 December 2023 – present)**\n\nOn 17 February 2024, Russia captured Avdiivka, a longtime stronghold for Ukraine that had been described as a \"gateway\" to nearby Donetsk. ABC News stated that Russia could use the development to boost morale with the war largely at a stalemate close to its second anniversary. Described by Forbes journalist David Axe as a pyrrhic Russian victory, the Russian 2nd and 41st Combined Arms Armies ended up with 16,000 men killed, tens of thousands wounded, and around 700 vehicles lost before seizing the ruins of Avdiivka.\n\n**Ukrainian offensive into Russia**\n\nOn 6 August 2024, Ukraine launched their first direct offensive into Russian territory, the largest of any pro-Ukrainian incursion since the invasion's inception, into the bordering Kursk Oblast. The main axis of the initial advance centered in the direction of the town of Sudzha, located 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from the border, which was reported by President Zelenskyy to have been captured on 15 August.\n\n**Russian Donbas advances**\n\nRussian troops continued advancing in eastern Ukraine, notably at a faster pace than prior to the Kursk offensive, including towards the strategically important city of Pokrovsk, where their number of forces had instead been increased.\n\n**Battlespaces**\n\nThe supreme commanders-in-chief are the heads of state of the respective governments: President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine. Putin has reportedly meddled in operational decisions, bypassing senior commanders and giving orders directly to brigade commanders.\n\n**Missile attacks and aerial warfare**\n\nAerial warfare began the first day of the invasion. Dozens of missile attacks were recorded across both eastern and western Ukraine, reaching as far west as Lviv.\n\n**Crimea attacks**\n\nOn 31 July 2022, Russian Navy Day commemorations were canceled after a drone attack reportedly wounded several people at the Russian Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Sevastopol. On 9 August 2022, large explosions were reported at Saky Air Base in western Crimea. Satellite imagery showed at least eight aircraft damaged or destroyed. Initial speculation attributed the explosions to long-range missiles, sabotage by special forces, or an accident.\n\n**Russian attacks against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure**\n\nSince fall 2022, Russia has carried out waves of strikes on Ukrainian electrical and water systems. On 6 October, the Ukrainian military reported that 86 Shahed 136 kamikaze drones had been launched by Russian forces in total. Between 30 September and 6 October, Ukrainian forces had destroyed 24 out of 46 launched in that period.\n\n**Naval blockade and engagements**\n\nUkraine lies on the Black Sea, which has ocean access only through the Turkish-held Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits. On 28 February, Turkey invoked the 1936 Montreux Convention and sealed off the straits to Russian warships that were not registered to Black Sea home bases and returning to their ports of origin.\n\n**Ukrainian resistance**\n\nUkrainian civilians resisted the Russian invasion by volunteering for territorial defense units, making Molotov cocktails, donating food, building barriers like Czech hedgehogs, and helping to transport refugees. Responding to a call from Ukravtodor, Ukraine's transportation agency, civilians dismantled or altered road signs, constructed makeshift barriers, and blocked roadways.\n\n**Foreign involvement**\n\nIn response to the invasion, many countries have supplied military aid to Ukraine, including weaponry, equipment, training, and logistical support. Western and other countries imposed limited sanctions on Russia in the prelude to the invasion and applied new sanctions when the invasion began, intending to cripple the Russian economy. Sanctions targeted individuals, banks, businesses, monetary exchanges, exports, and imports.\n\n**Support for Ukraine**\n\nIn response to the invasion, many countries have supplied military aid to Ukraine, including weaponry, equipment, training, and logistical support. Western and other countries imposed limited sanctions on Russia in the prelude to the invasion and applied new sanctions when the invasion began, intending to cripple the Russian economy. Sanctions targeted individuals, banks, businesses, monetary exchanges, exports, and imports.\n\n**Support for Russia**\n\nBelarus has allowed Russia to use its territory to stage part of the invasion, and to launch Russian missiles into Ukraine. Belarus airspace was used by Russia, including for radar early warning and control missions, until 2023, when a Russian Beriev A-50 surveillance plane was damaged by drones. Because of its active involvement, Belarus is considered a co-belligerent in this invasion, as contrasted to non-belligerent states, which have \"a wide range of tools available to non-belligerent actors without reaching the threshold of warfighting\".\n\n**Casualties**\n\nRussian and Ukrainian sources have both been said to inflate the casualty numbers for opposing forces and downplay their own losses for the sake of morale. Leaked US documents say that \"under-reporting of casualties within the [Russian] system highlights the military's 'continuing reluctance' to convey bad news up the chain of command\". Russia and Ukraine have admitted suffering \"significant\" and \"considerable\" losses, respectively.\n\n**Prisoners of war**\n\nOfficial and estimated numbers of prisoners of war (POW) have varied. On 24 February, Oksana Markarova, Ukraine's ambassador to the US, said that a platoon of the 74th Guards from Kemerovo Oblast had surrendered, saying they were unaware that they had been brought to Ukraine and ordered to kill Ukrainians. Russia claimed to have captured 572 Ukrainian soldiers as of 2 March 2022, while Ukraine said it held 562 Russian soldiers as of 20 March.\n\n**War crimes and attacks on civilians**\n\nDuring the invasion, the Russian military and authorities have been responsible for deliberate attacks against civilian targets, including strikes on hospitals and on the energy grid, massacres of civilians, abduction and torture of civilians, sexual violen", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine\" following this

the city of Kramatorsk took place on 8 April, reportedly killing at least 52 people [200] and injuring as many as 87 to 300 [201] On 11 April, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine expected a major new Russian offensive in the east [202] American officials said that Russia had withdrawn or been repulsed elsewhere in Ukraine, and therefore was preparing a retraction, resupply, and redeployment of infantry and tank divisions to the southeastern Ukraine front [203] [204] Military satellites photographed extensive Russian convoys of infantry and mechanised units deploying south from Kharkiv to Izium on 11 April, apparently part of the planned Russian redeployment of its northeastern troops to the southeastern front of the invasion [205]\n\n\nKharkiv front\nOn 14 April, Ukrainian troops reportedly blew up a bridge between Kharkiv and Izium used by Russian forces to redeploy troops to Izium, impeding the Russian convoy [222]\n\n\nKherson-Mykolaiv front\nMissile attacks and bombardment of the key cities of Mykolaiv and Odesa continued as the second phase of the invasion began [180] On 22 April 2022, Russia's Brigadier General Rustam Minnekayev in a defence ministry meeting said that Russia planned to extend its Mykolaiv–Odesa front after the siege of Mariupol further west to include the breakaway region of Transnistria on the Ukrainian border with Moldova [225] The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine called this plan imperialism and said that it contradicted previous Russian claims that it did not have territorial ambitions in Ukraine and also that the statement admitted that \"the goal of the 'second phase' of the war is not victory over the mythical Nazis, but simply the occupation of eastern and southern Ukraine.\" [225] Georgi Gotev of EURACTIV noted on 22 April that Russian occupation from Odesa to Transnistria would transform Ukraine into a landlocked nation with no practical access to the Black Sea [226] Russia resumed its missile strikes on Odesa on 24 April, destroying military facilities and causing two dozen civilian casualties [227]\n\n\nZaporizhzhia front\nAn IAEA delegation visited the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on 3 September, and on 6 September reported damage and security threats caused by external shelling and the presence of occupying troops in the plant [255] On 11 September, at 3:14 a.m., the sixth and final reactor was disconnected from the grid, \"completely stopping\" the plant Energoatom said that preparations were \"underway for its cooling and transfer to a cold state.\" [256]\n\n\nRussian annexations and occupation losses (6 September – 11 November 2022)\nOn 6 September 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a surprise counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region, beginning near Balakliia, led by General Syrskyi [246] An emboldened Kyiv launched a counteroffensive 12 September around Kharkiv successful enough to make Russia admit losing key positions and for The New York Times to say that it dented the image of a \"Mighty Putin\" Kyiv sought more arms from the West to sustain the counteroffensive [247] On 21 September 2022, Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilisation and Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu said 300,000 reservists would be called [248] He also said that his country would use \"all means\" to \"defend itself.\" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, said that the decision was predictable and that it was an attempt to justify \"Russia's failures.\" [249] British Foreign Office Minister Gillian Keegan called the situation an \"escalation\", [250] while former Mongolian president Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj accused Russia of using Russian Mongols as \"cannon fodder.\" [251]\n\n\nRussian annexation of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts\nIn late September 2022, Russian-installed officials in Ukraine organised referendums on the annexation of the occupied territories of Ukraine These included the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic in Russian-occupied Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine, as well as the Russian-appointed military administrations of Kherson Oblast and Zaporizhzhia Oblast Denounced by Ukraine's government and its allies as sham elections, the elections' official results showed overwhelming majorities in favour of annexation [252]\n\n\nZaporizhzhia front\nAn IAEA delegation visited the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on 3 September, and on 6 September reported damage and security threats caused by external shelling and the presence of occupying troops in the plant [255] On 11 September, at 3:14 a.m., the sixth and final reactor was disconnected from the grid, \"completely stopping\" the plant Energoatom said that preparations were \"underway for its cooling and transfer to a cold state.\" [256]\n\n\nKherson counteroffensive\nOn 29 August, Zelenskyy advisedly vowed the start of a full-scale counteroffensive in the southeast He first announced a counteroffensive to retake Russian-occupied territory in the south concentrating on the Kherson-Mykolaiv region, a claim that was corroborated by the Ukrainian parliament as well as Operational Command South [258]\n\n\nKharkiv counteroffensive\nUkrainian forces launched another surprise counteroffensive on 6 September in the Kharkiv Oblast near Balakliia led by General Syrskyi [246] By 7 September, Ukrainian forces had advanced some 20 kilometres (12 mi) into Russian occupied territory and claimed to have recaptured approximately 400 square kilometres (150 sq mi) Russian commentators said this was likely due to the relocation of Russian forces to Kherson in response to the Ukrainian offensive there [266] On 8 September, Ukrainian forces captured Balakliia and advanced to within 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) of Kupiansk [267] Military analysts said Ukrainian forces appeared to be moving towards Kupiansk, a major railway hub, with the aim of cutting off the Russian forces at Izium from the north [268]\n\n\nWinter stalemate, attrition campaign and military surge (12 November 2022 – 7 June 2023)\nAfter the end of the twin Ukrainian counteroffensives, the fighting shifted to a semi-deadlock during the winter, [276] with heavy casualties but reduced motion of the frontline [277] Russia launched a self-proclaimed winter offensive in eastern Ukraine, but the campaign ended in \"disappointment\" for Moscow, with limited gains as the offensive stalled [276] [278] Analysts variously blamed the failure on Russia's lack of \"trained men\", and supply problems with artillery ammunition, among other problems [276] [278] Near the end of May, Mark Galeotti assessed that \"after Russia's abortive and ill-conceived winter offensive, which squandered its opportunity to consolidate its forces, Ukraine is in a relatively strong position.\" [279]\n\n\nBattle of Bakhmut\nFollowing defeat in Kherson and Kharkiv, Russian and Wagner forces focused on taking the city of Bakhmut and breaking the half year long stalemate that prevailed there since the start of the war Russian forces sought to encircle the city, attacking from the north via Soledar After taking heavy casualties, Russian and Wagner forces took control of Soledar on 16 January 2023 [285] [286] By early February 2023, Bakhmut was facing attacks from north, south and east, with the sole Ukrainian supply lines coming from Chasiv Yar to the west [287]\n\n\n2023 counteroffensives and summer campaign (8 June 2023 – 1 December 2023)\nIn June 2023, Ukrainian forces gradually launched a series of counteroffensives on multiple fronts, including Donetsk Oblast, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, and others [297] On 8 June 2023, counteroffensive efforts focused near settlements such as Orikhiv, Tokmak, and Bakhmut [298] However, counteroffensive operations faced stiff resistance from Russia, [299] and the American think tank Institute for the Study of War described the Russian defensive effort as having \"an uncharacteristic degree of coherency.\" [300] By 12 June, Ukraine reported its fastest advance in seven months, claiming to have liberated several villages and advanced a total of 6.5 km Russian military bloggers also reported that Ukraine had taken Blahodatne, Makarivka and Neskuchne, and were continuing to push southward [301] Ukraine continued to liberate settlements over the next few months, raising the Ukrainian flag over the settlement of Robotyne in late August [302]\n\n\nRussian spring and summer campaigns and Ukrainian incursion (1 December 2023 – present)\nOn 17 February 2024, Russia captured Avdiivka, a longtime stronghold for Ukraine that had been described as a \"gateway\" to nearby Donetsk [325] [326] [327] ABC News stated that Russia could use the development to boost morale with the war largely at a stalemate close to its second anniversary [328] Described by Forbes journalist David Axe as a pyrrhic Russian victory, the Russian 2nd and 41st Combined Arms Armies ended up with 16,000 men killed, tens of thousands wounded and around 700 vehicles lost before seizing the ruins of Avdiivka [329]\n\n\nRussian offensive\nOn 17 February 2024, Russia captured Avdiivka, a longtime stronghold for

wounded and around 700 vehicles lost before seizing the ruins of Avdiivka [329]\n\n\nUkrainian offensive into Russia\nOn 6 August 2024, Ukraine launched their first direct offensive into Russian territory, the largest of any pro-Ukrainian incursion since the invasion's inception, into the bordering Kursk Oblast [348] The main axis of the initial advance centred in the direction of the town of Sudzha, located 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from the border, [349] which was reported by President Zelenskyy to have been captured on 15 August [350] Ukraine, taking advantage of the lack of experienced units and defenses along the border with Kursk Oblast, was able to quickly seize territory in the opening days of the incursion [351] The incursion caused Russia to divert thousands of troops from occupied Ukrainian territory to counter the threat, [352] [353] though not from Donetsk Oblast [353]\n\n\nRussian Donbas advances\nRussian troops continued advancing in eastern Ukraine, notably at a faster pace than prior to the Kursk offensive, [354] including towards the strategically important city of Pokrovsk, where their number of forces had instead been increased [355] [356] [357]\n\n\nBattlespaces\nThe supreme commanders-in-chief are the heads of state of the respective governments: President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine Putin has reportedly meddled in operational decisions, bypassing senior commanders and giving orders directly to brigade commanders [365]\n\n\nCommand\nThe supreme commanders-in-chief are the heads of state of the respective governments: President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine Putin has reportedly meddled in operational decisions, bypassing senior commanders and giving orders directly to brigade commanders [365]\n\n\nMissile attacks and aerial warfare\nAerial warfare began the first day of the invasion Dozens of missile attacks were recorded across both eastern and western Ukraine, [87] [88] reaching as far west as Lviv [167]\n\n\nCrimea attacks\nOn 31 July 2022, Russian Navy Day commemorations were cancelled after a drone attack reportedly wounded several people at the Russian Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Sevastopol [376] On 9 August 2022, large explosions were reported at Saky Air Base in western Crimea Satellite imagery showed at least eight aircraft damaged or destroyed Initial speculation attributed the explosions to long-range missiles, sabotage by special forces or an accident; [377] Ukrainian general Valerii Zaluzhnyi claimed responsibility on 7 September [378]\n\n\nRussian attacks against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure\nSince fall of 2022, Russia has carried out waves of strikes on Ukrainian electrical and water systems [384] On 6 October the Ukrainian military reported that 86 Shahed 136 kamikaze drones had been launched by Russian forces in total, and between 30 September and 6 October Ukrainian forces had destroyed 24 out of 46 launched in that period [385] On 8 October, it was announced that General of the Army Sergey Surovikin would be commanding all Russian forces in Ukraine on the strength of his novel air assault technique [386]\n\n\nNaval blockade and engagements\nUkraine lies on the Black Sea, which has ocean access only through the Turkish-held Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits On 28 February, Turkey invoked the 1936 Montreux Convention and sealed off the straits to Russian warships that were not registered to Black Sea home bases and returning to their ports of origin It specifically denied passage through the Turkish Straits to four Russian naval vessels [405] On 24 February, the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine announced that Russian Navy ships had begun an attack on Snake Island [406] The guided missile cruiser Moskva and patrol boat Vasily Bykov bombarded the island with deck guns [407] The Russian warship identified itself and instructed the Ukrainians on the island to surrender Their response was \"Russian warship, go fuck yourself!\" [408] After the bombardment, a detachment of Russian soldiers landed and took control of Snake Island [409] Russia said on 26 February that US drones had supplied intelligence to the Ukrainian navy to help it target Russian warships in the Black Sea The US denied this [410]\n\n\nUkrainian resistance\nUkrainian civilians resisted the Russian invasion by volunteering for territorial defence units, making Molotov cocktails, donating food, building barriers like Czech hedgehogs, [434] and helping to transport refugees [435] Responding to a call from Ukravtodor, Ukraine's transportation agency, civilians dismantled or altered road signs, [436] constructed makeshift barriers, and blocked roadways [437] Social media reports showed spontaneous street protests against Russian forces in occupied settlements, often evolving into verbal altercations and physical standoffs with Russian troops [438] By the beginning of April, Ukrainian civilians began to organise as guerrillas, mostly in the wooded north and east of the country The Ukrainian military announced plans for a large-scale guerrilla campaign to complement its conventional defence [439]\n\n\nForeign involvement\nIn response to the invasion, many countries have supplied military aid to Ukraine including weaponry, equipment, training, and logistical support Western and other countries imposed limited sanctions on Russia in the prelude to the invasion and applied new sanctions when the invasion began, intending to cripple the Russian economy; [446] [447] sanctions targeted individuals, banks, businesses, monetary exchanges, exports, and imports [446]\n\n\nSupport for Ukraine\nIn response to the invasion, many countries have supplied military aid to Ukraine including weaponry, equipment, training, and logistical support Western and other countries imposed limited sanctions on Russia in the prelude to the invasion and applied new sanctions when the invasion began, intending to cripple the Russian economy; [446] [447] sanctions targeted individuals, banks, businesses, monetary exchanges, exports, and imports [446]\n\n\nSupport for Russia\nBelarus has allowed Russia to use its territory to stage part of the invasion, and to launch Russian missiles into Ukraine [462] Belarus airspace was used by Russia, including for radar early warning and control missions, until 2023, when a Russian Beriev A-50 surveillance plane was damaged by drones [463] Because of its active involvement, Belarus is considered a co-belligerent [464] [465] (but not a co-combatant [466]) in this invasion, as contrasted to non-belligerent states, which have \"a wide range of tools available to non-belligerent actors without reaching the threshold of warfighting\" [467]\n\n\nCasualties\nRussian and Ukrainian sources have both been said to inflate the casualty numbers for opposing forces and downplay their own losses for the sake of morale [497] Leaked US documents say that \"under-reporting of casualties within the  [Russian] system highlights the military's 'continuing reluctance' to convey bad news up the chain of command.\" [498] Russian news outlets have largely stopped reporting the Russian death toll [499] Russia and Ukraine have admitted suffering \"significant\" [500] and \"considerable\" losses, respectively [501] [502]\n\n\nPrisoners of war\nOfficial and estimated numbers of prisoners of war (POW) have varied [549] On 24 February, Oksana Markarova, Ukraine's ambassador to the US, said that a platoon of the 74th Guards from Kemerovo Oblast had surrendered, saying they were unaware that they had been brought to Ukraine and ordered to kill Ukrainians [550] Russia claimed to have captured 572 Ukrainian soldiers as of 2 March 2022, [551] while Ukraine said it held 562 Russian soldiers as of 20 March [552] It also released one soldier for five of its own and exchanged another nine for the detained mayor of Melitopol [553]\n\n\nWar crimes and attacks on civilians\nDuring the invasion, the Russian military and authorities have been responsible for deliberate attacks against civilian targets [565] (including strikes on hospitals and on the energy grid), massacres of civilians, abduction and torture of civilians, sexual violence, [566] forced deportation of civilians, and torture and murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war They have also carried out many indiscriminate attacks in densely populated areas, including with cluster bombs [567] [568] [569]\n\n\nAbduction of Ukrainian children\nIn June 2024, an investigation by the Financial Times identified four Ukrainian children on a Russian government-linked adoption website that had been abducted from state care homes The children's Ukrainian background was not mentioned One child was shown with a new Russian name and age that differed from their Ukrainian documents, another was shown using a Russian version of their Ukrainian name 17 additional matches identified by the Financial Times on the adoption website were also confirmed as Ukrainian children in a recent New York Times investigation Ukrainian authorities estimate that nearly 20,000 Ukrainian children have been forcibly taken from occupied territories to Russia since the full-scale invasion began Wayne Jordash, president of humanitarian law firm Global Rights Compliance, described forcibly transferring or deporting children as war crimes, adding that when done as part of a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population, Russia is also committing crimes against humanity [577] [578]\n\n\nInternational arrest warrants\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) opened an investigation into possible crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes [579] On 17 March 2023 the ICC issued a warrant for Putin's arrest, charging him with individual criminal responsibility in the abduction of children forcibly deported to Russia [580] It was the first time that the ICC had issued an arrest warrant for the head of state of a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council [580] (the world's five principal nuclear powers) [581] Moscow has denied any involvement in war crimes, a response Vittorio Bufacchi of University College Cork says \"has bordered on the farcical,\" [582] and its contention that the images coming out of Bucha were fabricated \"a disingenuous response born by delusional hubris, post-truth on overdrive, (that) does not merit to be taken seriously.\" Even the usually fractured United States Senate came together to call Putin a war criminal [583]\n\n\nImpacts\nThe humanitarian impact of the invasion has been extensive and has included negative impacts on international food supplies and the 2022 food crises [588] An estimated 6.6 million Ukrainians were internally displaced by August 2022, and about the same number were refugees in other countries [589] The invasion has devastated the cultural heritage of Ukraine, [590] with over 500 Ukrainian cultural heritage sites, including cultural centres, theatres, museums, and churches, affected by \"Russian aggression.\" Ukraine's Minister of Culture called it cultural genocide [591] Deliberate destruction and looting of Ukrainian cultural heritage sites in this way is considered a war crime [592]\n\n\nHumanitarian

destruction and looting of Ukrainian cultural heritage sites in this way is considered a war crime [592]\n\n\nRefugee crisis\nThe war caused the largest refugee and humanitarian crisis in Europe since the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s; [596] [597] the UN described it as the fastest growing such crisis since World War II [598] As Russia built up military forces along the Ukrainian border, many neighbouring governments and aid organisations prepared for a mass displacement event in the weeks before the invasion In December 2021, the Ukrainian defence minister estimated that an invasion could force three to five million people to flee their homes [599]\n\n\nLong-term demographic effects\nBoth Russia and Ukraine faced the prospect of significant population decline even before the war, having among the lowest fertility rates worldwide and considerable emigration It is the first time that two countries with an average age above 40 have gone to war against each other [619] Russia had a fighting-age (18- to 40-year-old) male population more than four times higher than Ukraine's and slightly higher birth rates, while the willingness to fight was more pronounced in Ukraine [620]\n\n\nEnvironmental impact\nBased on a preliminary assessment, the war has inflicted USD 51 billion in environmental damage in Ukraine; according to a report by the Yale School of the Environment, some 687,000 tons of petrochemicals have burned as a result of shelling, while nearly 1,600 tons of pollutants have leaked into bodies of water Hazardous chemicals have contaminated around 70 acres of soil, and likely made agricultural activities temporarily impossible [635] Around 30% of Ukraine's land is now littered with explosives and more than 2.4 million hectares of forest have been damaged [636]\n\n\nNuclear risk\nSenior Russian politicians—including Putin, Sergey Lavrov, and Dmitry Medvedev—have made statements widely seen as nuclear blackmail They have implied that Russia may use nuclear weapons if certain \"red lines\" are crossed, such as helping Ukraine to strike back at Russia itself.\n\n\nEconomic impact\nUkrainian Minister of Economic Development and Trade Yulia Svyrydenko announced that for 2022 Ukraine had a 30.4% loss in their GDP [655] The International Monetary Fund predicted that Ukraine's gross domestic product (GDP) would suffer a decrease from a minimum of 10% to a maximum of 35%; [656] the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development also predicted that the invasion would cause a 20% decrease of Ukraine's GDP [657] However, the Ukrainian statistics service said that the GDP of Ukraine in 2023 grew by 5.3% [658]\n\n\nUkraine\nUkrainian Minister of Economic Development and Trade Yulia Svyrydenko announced that for 2022 Ukraine

[663]\n\n\nPeace efforts\nPeace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine took place on 28 February, 3 March, and 7 March 2022, on the Belarus–Ukraine border, with further talks held on 10 March in Turkey and a fourth round of negotiations beginning 14 March [670]\n\n\nInternational reactions\nThe invasion received widespread international condemnation from governments and intergovernmental organisations [696] On 2 March 2022 and on 23 February 2023, 141 member states of the UN General Assembly voted for a resolution saying that Russia should immediately withdraw Seven, including Russia, voted against the measure [697] Political reactions to the invasion included new sanctions imposed on Russia, which triggered widespread economic effects on the Russian and world economies [698] Sanctions forced Russia to reorient its oil exports to non-sanctioning countries such as India, rely more on LNG (which was not subject to European Union sanctions), and shift its coal exports from Europe to Asia [699] Most European countries cancelled nuclear cooperation with Russia [700]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal

Mazar-i-Sharif, Mianwali, and Attock [citation needed]\n\n\nIndia\nPashtuns in India are often referred to as Pathans (the Hindustani word for Pashtun) both by themselves and other ethnic groups of the subcontinent [57] [58] [59] [60] Some Indians claim descent from Pashtun soldiers who settled in India by marrying local women during the Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent [61] Many Pathans chose to live in the Republic of India after the partition of India and Khan Mohammad Atif, a professor at the University of Lucknow, estimates that \"The population of Pathans in India is twice their population in Afghanistan\" [62]\n\n\nIran\nPashtuns are also found in smaller numbers in the eastern and northern parts of Iran [80] Records as early as the mid-1600s report Durrani Pashtuns living in the Khorasan Province of Safavid Iran [81] After the short reign of the Ghilji Pashtuns in Iran, Nader Shah defeated the last independent Ghilji ruler of Kandahar, Hussain Hotak In order to secure Durrani control in southern Afghanistan, Nader Shah deported Hussain Hotak and large numbers of the Ghilji Pashtuns to the Mazandaran Province in northern Iran The remnants of this once sizable exiled community, although assimilated, continue to claim Pashtun descent [82] During the early 18th century, in the course of a very few years, the number of Durrani Pashtuns in Iranian Khorasan, greatly increased [83] Later the region became part of the Durrani Empire itself The second Durrani king of Afghanistan, Timur Shah Durrani was born in Mashhad [84] Contemporary to Durrani rule in the east, Azad Khan Afghan, an ethnic Ghilji Pashtun, formerly second in charge of Azerbaijan during Afsharid rule, gained power in the western regions of Iran and Azerbaijan for a short period [85] According to a sample survey in 1988, 75 percent of all Afghan refugees in the southern part of the Iranian Khorasan Province were Durrani Pashtuns [86]\n\n\nIn other regions\nIndian and Pakistani Pashtuns have utilised the British/Commonwealth links of their respective countries, and modern communities have been established starting around the 1960s mainly in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia but also in other commonwealth countries (and the United States) Some Pashtuns have also settled in the Middle East, such as in the Arabian Peninsula For example, about 300,000 Pashtuns migrated to the Persian Gulf countries between 1976 and 1981, representing 35% of Pakistani immigrants [87] The Pakistani and Afghan diaspora around the world includes Pashtuns.\n\n\nEtymology\nA tribe called Pakthās, one of the tribes that fought against Sudas in the Dasarajna, or \"Battle of the Ten Kings\", are mentioned in the seventh mandala of the Rigveda, a text of Vedic Sanskrit hymns dated between c 1500 and 1200 BCE: [88] [89]\n\n\nAncient historical references: Pashtun\nA tribe called Pakthās, one of the tribes that fought against Sudas in the Dasarajna, or \"Battle of the Ten Kings\", are mentioned in the seventh mandala of the Rigveda, a text of Vedic Sanskrit hymns dated between c 1500 and 1200 BCE: [88] [89]\n\n\nMiddle historical references: Afghan\nIn the Middle Ages until the advent of modern Afghanistan in the 18th century, the Pashtuns were often referred to as \"Afghans\" [107]\nThe etymological view supported by numerous noted scholars is that the name Afghan evidently derives from Sanskrit Aśvakan, or the Assakenoi of Arrian, which was the name used for ancient inhabitants of the Hindu Kush [108] Aśvakan literally means \"horsemen\", \"horse breeders\", or \"cavalrymen\" (from aśva or aspa, the Sanskrit and Avestan words for \"horse\") [109] This view was propounded by scholars like Christian Lassen, [110] J W McCrindle, [111] M V de Saint Martin, [112] and É Reclus, [113] [114] [115] [116] [117] [118]\n\n\nHistory and origins\nThe ethnogenesis of the Pashtun ethnic group is unclear There are many conflicting theories amongst historians and the Pashtuns themselves Modern scholars believe that Pashtuns do not all share the same origin The early ancestors of modern-day Pashtuns may have belonged to old Iranian tribes that spread throughout the eastern Iranian plateau [133] [134] [28] historians have also come across references to various ancient peoples called Pakthas (Pactyans) between the 2nd and the 1st millennium BC, [135] [136]\n\n\nLinguistic origin\nPashto is generally classified as an Eastern Iranian language [138] [139] [140] It shares features with the Munji language, which is the closest existing language to the extinct Bactrian, [141] but also shares features with the Sogdian language, as well as Khwarezmian, Shughni, Sanglechi, and Khotanese Saka [142]\n\n\nDiverse origin\nAccording to one school of thought, Pashtun are descended  from a variety of ethnicities, including Persians, Greeks, Turks, Arabs, Bactrians, Dards, Scythians, Tartars, Huns (Hephthalites), Mongols, Moghals (Mughals), and anyone else who has crossed the region where these Pashtun live Further they are also, and probably most surprisingly, of Israelite descent [149] [150]\n\n\nGreek origin\nAccording to Firasat et al 2007,  a proportion of Pashtuns may descend from Greeks, but they also suggest that Greek ancestry may also have come from Greek slaves brought by Xerxes I [154]\n\n\nHephthalite origin\nAccording to some accounts the Ghilji tribe has been connected to the Khalaj people [161] Following al-Khwarizmi, Josef Markwart claimed the Khalaj to be remnants of the Hephthalite confederacy [162] The Hephthalites may have been Indo-Iranian, [162] although the view that they were of Turkic Gaoju origin [163] \"seems to be most prominent at present\" [164] The Khalaj may originally have been Turkic-speaking and only federated with Iranian Pashto-speaking tribes in Medieval times [165]\n\n\nAnthropology and oral traditions\nSome anthropologists lend credence to the oral traditions of the Pashtun tribes themselves For example, according to the Encyclopaedia of Islam, the theory of Pashtun descent from Israelites is traced to Nimat Allah al-Harawi, who compiled a history for Khan-e-Jehan Lodhi in the reign of Mughal Emperor Jehangir in the 17th century [172] The 13th century Tabaqat-i Nasiri discusses the settlement of immigrant Bani Israel at the end of the 8th century CE in the Ghor region of Afghanistan, settlement attested by Jewish inscriptions in Ghor Historian André Wink suggests that the story \"may contain a clue to the remarkable theory of the Jewish origin of some of the Afghan tribes which is persistently advocated in the Persian-Afghan chronicles.\" [173] These references to Bani Israel agree with the commonly held view by Pashtuns that when the twelve tribes of Israel were dispersed, the tribe of Joseph, among other Hebrew tribes, settled in the Afghanistan region [174] This oral tradition is widespread among the Pashtun tribes There have been many legends over the centuries of descent from the Ten Lost Tribes after groups converted to Christianity and Islam Hence the tribal name Yusufzai in Pashto translates to the \"son of Joseph\" A similar story is told by many historians, including the 14th century Ibn Battuta and 16th century Ferishta [32] However, the similarity of names can also be traced to the presence of Arabic through Islam [175]\n\n\nTheory of Pashtun descent from Israelites\nSome anthropologists lend credence to the oral traditions of the Pashtun tribes themselves For example, according to the Encyclopaedia of Islam, the theory of Pashtun descent from Israelites is traced to Nimat Allah al-Harawi, who compiled a history for Khan-e-Jehan Lodhi in the reign of Mughal Emperor Jehangir in the 17th century [172] The 13th century Tabaqat-i Nasiri discusses the settlement of immigrant Bani Israel at the end of the 8th century CE in the Ghor region of Afghanistan, settlement attested by

century Ibn Battuta and 16th century Ferishta [32] However, the similarity of names can also be traced to the presence of Arabic through Islam [175]\n\n\nModern era\nTheir modern past stretches back to the Delhi Sultanate (Khalji and Lodi dynasty), the Hotak dynasty and the Durrani Empire The Hotak rulers rebelled against the Safavids and seized control over much of Persia from 1722 to 1729 [180] This was followed by the conquests of Ahmad Shah Durrani who was a former high-ranking military commander under Nader Shah and founder of the Durrani Empire, which covered most of what is now Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kashmir, Indian Punjab, as well as the Kohistan and Khorasan provinces of Iran [181] After the decline of the Durrani dynasty in the first half of the 19th century under Shuja Shah Durrani, the Barakzai dynasty took control of the empire Specifically, the Mohamedzais held Afghanistan's monarchy from around 1826 to the end of Zahir Shah's reign in 1973.\n\n\nGenetics\nThe majority of Pashtuns from Afghanistan belong to R1a, with a frequency of 50-65% [209] Subclade R1a-Z2125 occurs at a frequency of 40% [210] This subclade is predominantly found in Tajiks, Turkmen, Uzbeks and in some populations in the Caucasus and Iran [211] Haplogroup G-M201 reaches 9% in Afghan Pashtuns and is the second most frequent haplogroup in Pashtuns from southern Afghanistan [209] [212] Haplogroup L and Haplogroup J2 occurs at an overall frequency of 6% [209] According to a Mitochondrial DNA analysis of four ethnic groups of Afghanistan, the majority of mtDNA among Afghan Pashtuns belongs to West Eurasian lineages, and share a greater affinity with West Eurasian and Central Asian populations rather than to populations of South Asia or East Asia The haplogroup analysis indicates the Pashtuns and Tajiks in Afghanistan share ancestral heritage Among the studied ethnic groups, the Pashtuns have the greatest mtDNA diversity [213] The most frequent haplogroup among Pakistani Pashtuns is haplogroup R which is found at a rate of 28-50% Haplogroup J2 was found in 9% to 24% depending on the study and Haplogroup E has been found at a frequency of 4% to 13% Haplogroup L occurs at a rate of 8% Certain Pakistani Pashtun groups exhibit high levels of R1b [214] [215] Overall Pashtun groups are genetically diverse, and the Pashtun ethnic group is not a single genetic population Different Pashtun groups exhibit different genetic backgrounds, resulting in considerable heterogeneity [216]\n\n\nDefinitions\nThe most prominent views amongst Pashtuns as to who exactly qualifies as a Pashtun are: [224]\n\n\nTribes\nA prominent institution of the Pashtun people is the intricate system of tribes [230] The tribal system has several levels of organisation: the tribe they are in is from four 'greater' tribal groups: the Sarbani, the Bettani, the Gharghashti, and the Karlani [231] The tribe is then divided into kinship groups called khels, which in turn is divided into smaller groups (pllarina or plarganey), each consisting of several extended families called kahols [232]\n\n\nDurrani and Ghilji Pashtuns\nThe Durranis and Ghiljis (or Ghilzais) are the two largest groups of Pashtuns, with approximately two-thirds of Afghan Pashtuns belonging to these confederations [233] The Durrani tribe has been more urban and politically successful, while the Ghiljis are more numerous, more rural, and reputedly tougher In the 18th century, the groups collaborated at times and at other times fought each other With a few gaps, Durranis ruled modern Afghanistan continuously until the Saur Revolution of 1978; the new communist rulers were Ghilji [234]\n\n\nLanguage\nPashto is the mother tongue of most Pashtuns [235] [236] [237] It is one of the two national languages of Afghanistan [238] [239] In Pakistan, although being the second-largest language being spoken, [240] it is often neglected officially in the education system [241] [242] [243] [244] [245] [246] This has been criticised as adversely impacting the economic advancement of Pashtuns, [247] [248] as students do not have the ability to comprehend what is being taught in other languages fully [249] Robert Nichols remarks: [250]\n\n\nCulture\nPashtun culture is based on Pashtunwali, Islam and the understanding of Pashto language The Kabul dialect is used to standardize the present Pashto alphabet [262] Poetry is also an important part of Pashtun culture and it has been for centuries [263] Pre-Islamic traditions, dating back to Alexander's defeat of the Persian Empire in 330 BC, possibly survived in the form of traditional dances, while literary styles and music reflect influence from the Persian tradition and regional musical instruments fused with localised variants and interpretation Like other Muslims, Pashtuns celebrate Islamic holidays Contrary to the Pashtuns living in Pakistan, Nowruz in Afghanistan is celebrated as the Afghan New Year by all Afghan ethnicities.\n\n\nJirga\nAnother prominent Pashtun institution is the lóya jirgá (Pashto: لويه جرګه) or 'grand council' of elected elders [264] Most decisions in tribal life are made by members of the jirgá (Pashto: جرګه), which has been the main institution of authority that the largely egalitarian Pashtuns willingly acknowledge as a viable governing body [265]\n\n\nReligion\nBefore Islam there were various different beliefs which were practiced by Pashtuns such as Zoroastrianism, [266] Buddhism and Hinduism [267]\n\n\nPashto literature and poetry\nThe majority of Pashtuns use Pashto as their native tongue, belonging to the Iranian language family, [282] and spoken by up to 60 million people [283] [284] It is written in the Pashto-Arabic script and is divided into two main dialects, the southern \"Pashto\" and the northern \"Pukhto\" The language has ancient origins and bears similarities to extinct languages such as Avestan and Bactrian [285] Its closest modern relatives may include Pamir languages, such as Shughni and Wakhi, and Ossetic [286] Pashto may have ancient legacy of borrowing vocabulary from neighbouring languages including such as Persian and Vedic Sanskrit Modern borrowings come primarily from the English language [287]\n\n\nMedia and arts\nPashto media has expanded in the last decade, with a number of Pashto TV channels becoming available Two of the popular ones are the Pakistan-based AVT Khyber and Pashto One Pashtuns around the world, particularly those in Arab countries, watch these for entertainment purposes and to get latest news about their native areas [294] Others are Afghanistan-based Shamshad TV, Radio Television Afghanistan, TOLOnews and Lemar TV, which has a special children's show called Baghch-e-Simsim International news sources that provide Pashto programs include BBC Pashto and Voice of America.\n\n\nSports\nBoth the Pakistan national cricket team and the Afghanistan national cricket team have Pashtun players [296] One of the most popular sports among Pashtuns is cricket, which was introduced to South Asia during the early 18th century with the arrival of the British Many Pashtuns have become prominent international cricketers, including Imran Khan, Shahid Afridi, Majid Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq, Younis Khan, [297] Umar Gul, [298] Junaid Khan, [299] Fakhar Zaman, [300] Mohammad Rizwan, [301] Usman Shinwari, Naseem Shah, Shaheen Afridi, Iftikhar Ahmed, Mohammad Wasim and Yasir Shah [302] Australian cricketer Fawad Ahmed is of Pakistani Pashtun origin who has played for the Australian national team [303]\n\n\nWomen\nPashtun women are known to be modest and honorable because of their modest dressing [308] [309] The lives of Pashtun women vary from those who reside in the ultra-conservative rural areas to those found in urban centres [310] At the village level, the female village leader is called \"qaryadar\" Her duties may include witnessing women's ceremonies, mobilising women to practice religious festivals, preparing the female dead for burial, and performing services for deceased women She also arranges marriages for her own family and arbitrates conflicts for men and women [311] Though many Pashtun women remain tribal and illiterate, some have completed universities and joined the regular employment world [310]\n\n\nNotable people\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n\nReferences\n\n",

In Pakistan, although being the second-largest language being spoken, it is often neglected officially in the education system.\n\n**Culture**\n\nPashtun culture is based on Pashtunwali, Islam and the understanding of Pashto language. Poetry is also an important part of Pashtun culture and it has been for centuries. Pre-Islamic traditions, dating back to Alexander's defeat of the Persian Empire in 330 BC, possibly survived in the form of traditional dances, while literary styles and music reflect influence from the Persian tradition and regional musical instruments fused with localised variants and interpretation.\n\n**Jirga**\n\nAnother prominent Pashtun institution is the lóya jirgá (Pashto: لويه جرګه) or 'grand council' of elected elders. Most decisions in tribal life are made by members of the jirgá (Pashto: جرګه), which has been the main institution of authority that the largely egalitarian Pashtuns willingly acknowledge as a viable governing body.\n\n**Religion**\n\nBefore Islam there were various different beliefs which were practiced by Pashtuns such as Zoroastrianism, Buddhism and Hinduism.\n\n**Pashto Literature and Poetry**\n\nThe majority of Pashtuns use Pashto as their native tongue, belonging to the Iranian language family, and spoken by up to 60 million people. It is written in the Pashto-Arabic script and is divided into two main dialects, the southern \"Pashto\" and the northern \"Pukhto\".\n\n**Media and Arts**\n\nPashto media has expanded in the last decade, with a number of Pashto TV channels becoming available. Two of the popular ones are the Pakistan-based AVT Khyber and Pashto One.\n\n**Sports**\n\nBoth the Pakistan national cricket team and the Afghanistan national cricket team have Pashtun players. One of the most popular sports among Pashtuns is cricket, which was introduced to South Asia during the early 18th century with the arrival of the British.\n\n**Women**\n\nPashtun women are known to be modest and honorable because of their modest dressing. The lives of Pashtun women vary from those who reside in the ultra-conservative rural areas to those found in urban centres.\n\n**Notable People**\n\nImran Khan, Shahid Afridi, Majid Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq, Younis Khan, Umar Gul, Junaid Khan, Fakhar Zaman, Mohammad Rizwan, Usman Shinwari, Naseem Shah, Shaheen Afridi, Iftikhar Ahmed, Mohammad Wasim, Yasir Shah, Fawad Ahmed.\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of the Pashtun people, including their history, culture, language, and genetics.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Pashtuns\" following this outline:\n\n\nGeographic distribution\nPashtuns are spread over a wide geographic area, south of the Amu river and west of the Indus River They can be found all over Pakistan and Afghanistan [27] Big cities with a Pashtun majority include Jalalabad, Kandahar, Bannu, Dera Ismail Khan, Khost, Kohat, Lashkar Gah, Mardan, Ghazni, Mingora, Peshawar, Quetta, among others Pashtuns also live in Abbottabad, Farah, Herat, Islamabad, Kabul, Karachi, Kunduz, Lahore, Mazar-i-Sharif, Mianwali, and Attock [citation needed]\n\n\nPakistan and Afghanistan\nPashtuns are spread over a wide geographic area, south of the Amu river and west of the Indus River They can be found all over Pakistan and Afghanistan [27] Big cities with a Pashtun majority include Jalalabad, Kandahar, Bannu, Dera Ismail Khan, Khost, Kohat, Lashkar Gah, Mardan, Ghazni, Mingora, Peshawar, Quetta, among others Pashtuns also live in Abbottabad, Farah, Herat, Islamabad, Kabul, Karachi, Kunduz, Lahore, Mazar-i-Sharif, Mianwali, and Attock [citation needed]\n\n\nIndia\nPashtuns in India are often referred to as Pathans (the Hindustani word for Pashtun) both by themselves and other ethnic groups of the subcontinent [57] [58] [59] [60] Some Indians claim descent from Pashtun soldiers who settled in India by marrying local women during the Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent [61] Many Pathans chose to live in the Republic of India after the partition of India and Khan Mohammad Atif, a professor at the University of Lucknow, estimates that \"The population of Pathans in India is twice their population in Afghanistan\" [62]\n\n\nIran\nPashtuns are also found in smaller numbers in the eastern and northern parts of Iran [80] Records as early as the mid-1600s report Durrani Pashtuns living in the Khorasan Province of Safavid Iran [81] After the short reign of the Ghilji Pashtuns in Iran, Nader Shah defeated the last independent Ghilji ruler of Kandahar, Hussain Hotak In order to secure Durrani control in southern Afghanistan, Nader Shah deported Hussain Hotak and large numbers of the Ghilji Pashtuns to the Mazandaran Province in northern Iran The remnants of this once sizable exiled community, although assimilated, continue to claim Pashtun descent [82] During the early 18th century, in the course of a very few years, the number of Durrani Pashtuns in Iranian Khorasan, greatly increased [83] Later the region became part of the Durrani Empire itself The second Durrani king of Afghanistan, Timur Shah Durrani was born in Mashhad [84] Contemporary to Durrani rule in the east, Azad Khan Afghan, an ethnic Ghilji Pashtun, formerly second in charge of Azerbaijan during Afsharid rule, gained power in the western regions of Iran and Azerbaijan for a short period [85] According to a sample survey in 1988, 75 percent of all Afghan refugees in the southern part of the Iranian Khorasan Province were Durrani Pashtuns [86]\n\n\nIn other regions\nIndian and Pakistani Pashtuns have utilised the British/Commonwealth links of their respective countries, and modern communities have been established starting around the 1960s mainly in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia but also in other commonwealth countries (and the United States) Some Pashtuns have also settled in the Middle East, such as in the Arabian Peninsula For example, about 300,000 Pashtuns migrated to the Persian Gulf countries between 1976 and 1981, representing 35% of Pakistani immigrants [87] The Pakistani and Afghan diaspora around the world includes Pashtuns.\n\n\nEtymology\nA tribe called Pakthās, one of the tribes that fought against Sudas in the Dasarajna, or \"Battle of the Ten Kings\", are mentioned in the seventh mandala of the Rigveda, a text of Vedic Sanskrit hymns dated between c 1500 and 1200 BCE: [88] [89]\n\n\nAncient historical references: Pashtun\nA tribe called Pakthās, one of the tribes that fought against Sudas in the Dasarajna, or \"Battle of the Ten Kings\", are mentioned in the seventh mandala of the Rigveda, a text of Vedic Sanskrit hymns dated between c 1500 and 1200 BCE: [88] [89]\n\n\nMiddle historical references: Afghan\nIn the Middle Ages until the advent of modern Afghanistan in the 18th century, the Pashtuns were often referred to as \"Afghans\" [107]\nThe etymological view supported by numerous noted scholars is that the name Afghan evidently derives from Sanskrit Aśvakan, or the Assakenoi of Arrian, which was the name used for ancient inhabitants of the Hindu Kush [108] Aśvakan literally means \"horsemen\", \"horse breeders\", or \"cavalrymen\" (from aśva or aspa, the Sanskrit and Avestan words for \"horse\") [109] This view was propounded by scholars like Christian Lassen, [110] J W McCrindle, [111] M V de Saint Martin, [112] and É Reclus, [113] [114] [115] [116] [117] [118]\n\n\nHistory and origins\nThe ethnogenesis of the Pashtun ethnic group is unclear There are many conflicting theories amongst historians and the Pashtuns themselves Modern scholars believe that Pashtuns do not all share the same origin The early ancestors of modern-day Pashtuns may have belonged to old Iranian tribes that spread throughout the eastern Iranian plateau [133] [134] [28] historians have also come across references to various ancient peoples called Pakthas (Pactyans) between the 2nd and the 1st millennium BC, [135] [136]\n\n\nLinguistic origin\nPashto is generally classified as an Eastern Iranian language [138] [139] [140] It shares features with the Munji language, which is the closest existing language to the extinct Bactrian, [141] but also shares features with the Sogdian language, as well as Khwarezmian, Shughni, Sanglechi, and Khotanese Saka [142]\n\n\nDiverse origin\nAccording to one school of thought, Pashtun are descended  from a variety of ethnicities, including Persians, Greeks, Turks, Arabs, Bactrians, Dards, Scythians, Tartars, Huns (Hephthalites), Mongols, Moghals (Mughals), and anyone else who has crossed the region where these Pashtun live Further they are also, and probably most surprisingly, of Israelite descent [149] [150]\n\n\nGreek origin\nAccording to Firasat et al 2007,  a proportion of Pashtuns may descend from Greeks, but they also suggest that Greek ancestry may also have come from Greek slaves brought by Xerxes I [154]\n\n\nHephthalite origin\nAccording to some accounts the Ghilji tribe has been connected to the Khalaj people [161] Following al-Khwarizmi, Josef Markwart claimed the Khalaj to be remnants of the Hephthalite confederacy [162] The Hephthalites may have been Indo-Iranian, [162] although the view that they were of Turkic Gaoju origin [163] \"seems to be most prominent at present\" [164] The Khalaj may originally have been Turkic-speaking and only federated with Iranian Pashto-speaking tribes in Medieval times [165]\n\n\nAnthropology and oral traditions\nSome anthropologists lend credence to the oral traditions of the Pashtun tribes themselves For example, according to the Encyclopaedia of Islam, the theory of Pashtun descent from Israelites is traced to Nimat Allah al-Harawi, who compiled a history for Khan-e-Jehan Lodhi in the reign of Mughal Emperor Jehangir in the 17th century [172] The 13th century Tabaqat-i Nasiri discusses the settlement of immigrant Bani Israel at the end of the 8th century CE in the Ghor region of Afghanistan, settlement attested by Jewish inscriptions in Ghor Historian André Wink suggests that the story \"may contain a clue to the remarkable theory of the Jewish origin of some of the Afghan tribes which is persistently advocated in the Persian-Afghan chronicles.\" [173] These references to Bani Israel agree with the commonly held view by Pashtuns that when the twelve tribes of Israel were dispersed, the tribe of Joseph, among other Hebrew tribes, settled in the Afghanistan region [174] This oral tradition is widespread among the Pashtun tribes There have been many legends over the centuries of descent from the Ten Lost Tribes after groups converted to Christianity and Islam Hence the tribal name Yusufzai in Pashto translates to the \"son of Joseph\" A similar story is told by many historians, including the 14th century Ibn Battuta and 16th century Ferishta [32] However, the similarity of names can also be traced to the presence of Arabic through Islam [175]\n\n\nTheory of Pashtun descent from Israelites\nSome anthropologists lend credence to the oral traditions of the Pashtun tribes themselves For example, according to the Encyclopaedia of Islam, the theory of Pashtun descent from Israelites is traced to Nimat Allah al-Harawi, who compiled a history for Khan-e-Jehan Lodhi in the reign of Mughal Emperor Jehangir in the 17th century [172] The 13th century Tabaqat-i Nasiri discusses the settlement of immigrant Bani Israel at the end of the 8th century CE in the Ghor region of Afghanistan, settlement attested by

century Ibn Battuta and 16th century Ferishta [32] However, the similarity of names can also be traced to the presence of Arabic through Islam [175]\n\n\nModern era\nTheir modern past stretches back to the Delhi Sultanate (Khalji and Lodi dynasty), the Hotak dynasty and the Durrani Empire The Hotak rulers rebelled against the Safavids and seized control over much of Persia from 1722 to 1729 [180] This was followed by the conquests of Ahmad Shah Durrani who was a former high-ranking military commander under Nader Shah and founder of the Durrani Empire, which covered most of what is now Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kashmir, Indian Punjab, as well as the Kohistan and Khorasan provinces of Iran [181] After the decline of the Durrani dynasty in the first half of the 19th century under Shuja Shah Durrani, the Barakzai dynasty took control of the empire Specifically, the Mohamedzais held Afghanistan's monarchy from around 1826 to the end of Zahir Shah's reign in 1973.\n\n\nGenetics\nThe majority of Pashtuns from Afghanistan belong to R1a, with a frequency of 50-65% [209] Subclade R1a-Z2125 occurs at a frequency of 40% [210] This subclade is predominantly found in Tajiks, Turkmen, Uzbeks and in some populations in the Caucasus and Iran [211] Haplogroup G-M201 reaches 9% in Afghan Pashtuns and is the second most frequent haplogroup in Pashtuns from southern Afghanistan [209] [212] Haplogroup L and Haplogroup J2 occurs at an overall frequency of 6% [209] According to a Mitochondrial DNA analysis of four ethnic groups of Afghanistan, the majority of mtDNA among Afghan Pashtuns belongs to West Eurasian lineages, and share a greater affinity with West Eurasian and Central Asian populations rather than to populations of South Asia or East Asia The haplogroup analysis indicates the Pashtuns and Tajiks in Afghanistan share ancestral heritage Among the studied ethnic groups, the Pashtuns have the greatest mtDNA diversity [213] The most frequent haplogroup among Pakistani Pashtuns is haplogroup R which is found at a rate of 28-50% Haplogroup J2 was found in 9% to 24% depending on the study and Haplogroup E has been found at a frequency of 4% to 13% Haplogroup L occurs at a rate of 8% Certain Pakistani Pashtun groups exhibit high levels of R1b [214] [215] Overall Pashtun groups are genetically diverse, and the Pashtun ethnic group is not a single genetic population Different Pashtun groups exhibit different genetic backgrounds, resulting in considerable heterogeneity [216]\n\n\nDefinitions\nThe most prominent views amongst Pashtuns as to who exactly qualifies as a Pashtun are: [224]\n\n\nTribes\nA prominent institution of the Pashtun people is the intricate system of tribes [230] The tribal system has several levels of organisation: the tribe they are in is from four 'greater' tribal groups: the Sarbani, the Bettani, the Gharghashti, and the Karlani [231] The tribe is then divided into kinship groups called khels, which in turn is divided into smaller groups (pllarina or plarganey), each consisting of several extended families called kahols [232]\n\n\nDurrani and Ghilji Pashtuns\nThe Durranis and Ghiljis (or Ghilzais) are the two largest groups of Pashtuns, with approximately two-thirds of Afghan Pashtuns belonging to these confederations [233] The Durrani tribe has been more urban and politically successful, while the Ghiljis are more numerous, more rural, and reputedly tougher In the 18th century, the groups collaborated at times and at other times fought each other With a few gaps, Durranis ruled modern Afghanistan continuously until the Saur Revolution of 1978; the new communist rulers were Ghilji [234]\n\n\nLanguage\nPashto is the mother tongue of most Pashtuns [235] [236] [237] It is one of the two national languages of Afghanistan [238] [239] In Pakistan, although being the second-largest language being spoken, [240] it is often neglected officially in the education system [241] [242] [243] [244] [245] [246] This has been criticised as adversely impacting the economic advancement of Pashtuns, [247] [248] as students do not have the ability to comprehend what is being taught in other languages fully [249] Robert Nichols remarks: [250]\n\n\nCulture\nPashtun culture is based on Pashtunwali, Islam and the understanding of Pashto language The Kabul dialect is used to standardize the present Pashto alphabet [262] Poetry is also an important part of Pashtun culture and it has been for centuries [263] Pre-Islamic traditions, dating back to Alexander's defeat of the Persian Empire in 330 BC, possibly survived in the form of traditional dances, while literary styles and music reflect influence from the Persian tradition and regional musical instruments fused with localised variants and interpretation Like other Muslims, Pashtuns celebrate Islamic holidays Contrary to the Pashtuns living in Pakistan, Nowruz in Afghanistan is celebrated as the Afghan New Year by all Afghan ethnicities.\n\n\nJirga\nAnother prominent Pashtun institution is the lóya jirgá (Pashto: لويه جرګه) or 'grand council' of elected elders [264] Most decisions in tribal life are made by members of the jirgá (Pashto: جرګه), which has been the main institution of authority that the largely egalitarian Pashtuns willingly acknowledge as a viable governing body [265]\n\n\nReligion\nBefore Islam there were various different beliefs which were practiced by Pashtuns such as Zoroastrianism, [266] Buddhism and Hinduism [267]\n\n\nPashto literature and poetry\nThe majority of Pashtuns use Pashto as their native tongue, belonging to the Iranian language family, [282] and spoken by up to 60 million people [283] [284] It is written in the Pashto-Arabic script and is divided into two main dialects, the southern \"Pashto\" and the northern \"Pukhto\" The language has ancient origins and bears similarities to extinct languages such as Avestan and Bactrian [285] Its closest modern relatives may include Pamir languages, such as Shughni and Wakhi, and Ossetic [286] Pashto may have ancient legacy of borrowing vocabulary from neighbouring languages including such as Persian and Vedic Sanskrit Modern borrowings come primarily from the English language [287]\n\n\nMedia and arts\nPashto media has expanded in the last decade, with a number of Pashto TV channels becoming available Two of the popular ones are the Pakistan-based AVT Khyber and Pashto One Pashtuns around the world, particularly those in Arab countries, watch these for entertainment purposes and to get latest news about their native areas [294] Others are Afghanistan-based Shamshad TV, Radio Television Afghanistan, TOLOnews and Lemar TV, which has a special children's show called Baghch-e-Simsim International news sources that provide Pashto programs include BBC Pashto and Voice of America.\n\n\nSports\nBoth the Pakistan national cricket team and the Afghanistan national cricket team have Pashtun players [296] One of the most popular sports among Pashtuns is cricket, which was introduced to South Asia during the early 18th century with the arrival of the British Many Pashtuns have become prominent international cricketers, including Imran Khan, Shahid Afridi, Majid Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq, Younis Khan, [297] Umar Gul, [298] Junaid Khan, [299] Fakhar Zaman, [300] Mohammad Rizwan, [301] Usman Shinwari, Naseem Shah, Shaheen Afridi, Iftikhar Ahmed, Mohammad Wasim and Yasir Shah [302] Australian cricketer Fawad Ahmed is of Pakistani Pashtun origin who has played for the Australian national team [303]\n\n\nWomen\nPashtun women are known to be modest and honorable because of their modest dressing [308] [309] The lives of Pashtun women vary from those who reside in the ultra-conservative rural areas to those found in urban centres [310] At the village level, the female village leader is called \"qaryadar\" Her duties may include witnessing women's ceremonies, mobilising women to practice religious festivals, preparing the female dead for burial, and performing services for deceased women She also arranges marriages for her own family and arbitrates conflicts for men and women [311] Though many Pashtun women remain tribal and illiterate, some have completed universities and joined the regular employment world [310]\n\n\nNotable people\n\n\nExplanatory

Freedom and Change (FFC) agreed to a power-sharing deal with the military, creating the Sovereignty Council in August 2019 [26] According to the TMC–FFC agreement, the transition process would last three years and three months The Sovereignty Council was to be led by a military figure for 21 months, followed by a civilian leader for 18 months The handover was planned to take place in November 2021 [27]\n\n\n2019 coup and revolution\nPresident Omar al-Bashir, who had ruled the country since the 1989 coup, was overthrown by the military in April 2019 after weeks of mass protests, with the Transitional Military Council (TMC) taking power [25] Protests continued for some months The Khartoum massacre took place in June The protestors represented by the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC)

months The Sovereignty Council was to be led by a military figure for 21 months, followed by a civilian leader for 18 months The handover was planned to take place in November 2021 [27]\n\n\nSeptember coup attempt\nIn September 2021, a military coup attempt was thwarted by the government According to the Minister of Information, the perpetrators were \"remnants of the former regime\" who tried to take control of the state broadcasters television buildings and the military central command Following the incident, 40 officers were arrested [28] [29] Since then, tensions between the military and civilian leaders rose as military leaders started demanding reforms to the FFC coalition and called for the replacement of the cabinet [30]\n\n\nOctober 2021 pre-coup protests\nOn 16 October, pro-military protests organized by the Charter of the National Accord were held in Khartoum, during which protestors demanded a military coup  [31] They were allowed to reach the gates of the presidential palace with a negligible police presence They called for General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, chair of the Sovereignty Council, to seize control and take over the country [30] The pro-military protesters continued their sit-in outside the presidential palace in Khartoum through to 21 October [32]\n\n\nNegotiations and coup proposal\nSudanese prime minister Abdalla Hamdok tried negotiating between civilian and military groups following the September coup attempt [36]\n\n\nEvents\nAround dawn on 25 October 2021, [8] Sudan's military arrested at least five senior Sudanese government figures Later, internet outages across Sudan were reported [38] [39] [40] [28]\n\n\nCoup takes place and government dissolved\nAround dawn on 25 October 2021, [8] Sudan's military arrested at least five senior Sudanese government figures Later, internet outages across Sudan were reported [38] [39] [40] [28]\n\n\nArrests of government members\nMilitary forces placed civilian Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok under house arrest after besieging his home [46] Hamdok was pressured to make a statement supporting the coup, which he refused He called for Sudanese to resist the coup and \"defend their revolution\" In response to his refusal to support the coup, Hamdok was moved with his wife on 25 October to an unknown location [8] On 26 October, al-Burhan said that Hamdok was being detained in al-Burhan's own home to protect Hamdok from \"danger\" [44]\n\n\nResistance to the coup, arrests, and killings of civilians\nThe coup was met with resistance from pro-democracy Sudanese civilians, some of whom took to the streets of Khartoum in protest [48] The Sudanese Professionals Association and FFC, two of the coalitions that coordinated the Sudanese Revolution, called for mass civil disobedience and refusal to cooperate with the coup [13] The National Umma Party similarly denounced the arrests of the government ministers and called on the public to protest in the streets [28] The Sudanese Communist Party advocated for a workers' strike and mass civil disobedience [28]\n\n\nInternet outages\nFollowing the coup, Internet outages in Sudan were reported by international watchdog groups including NetBlocks The outages were later corroborated by the Sudan Information Ministry [28] The Sudanese Journalists Network interpreted the reason for the Internet and telecommunications cutoffs to be the security forces' aim of \"commit [ting] more crimes against the Sudanese\" and hiding evidence of the security forces' involvement in attacks including the 3 June 2019 Khartoum massacre [62] On 9 November, a judge in a Khartoum court ordered the country's major providers (MTN, Zain, and Sudani) to restore Internet services immediately [63]\n\n\nMedia\nGovernment-owned state television operated uninterrupted [7]\n\n\nGovernment ministries and embassies\nMariam al-Mahdi, Minister of Foreign Affairs rejected the coup, stating that \"any coup in the country is rejected\" and that Sudanese would \"resist  [the coup] by all civil means.\" She described the arrest of Hamdok as \"very dangerous and unacceptable\" [8] On 26 October, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs supported al-Mahdi's earlier statement [20] and al-Mahdi spoke directly to the Associated Press, stating \"We are still in our positions We reject such coup and such unconstitutional measures.\" [64]\n\n\nNegotiations and mediation\nOn 27 October, al-Burhan met with Volker Perthes, United Nations Special Representative and head of the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan (UNITAMS), in Khartoum The army media office described the meeting as aiming to find \"ways to get out of the crisis in order to achieve stability and peace in the country,\" while Perthes referred to \"return [ing] to a comprehensive and urgent dialogue to restore partnership on the basis of the Constitutional Document and the Juba Peace Agreement.\" [67] The following day, al-Burhan made a radio announcement declaring that Hamdok would be allowed to be restored as Prime Minister with a cabinet of his choosing, and the deposed official declined this initial offer, stating that he would only return to lead the government if the pre-coup system be restored Al-Burhan responded by also proposing a new government led by an independent technocrat Some observers judged that despite local and international efforts to mediate between al-Burhan's forces and civilian groups, there was little progress, as large sections of the Sudanese public appeared to be no longer willing to return to the pre-coup power-sharing system [23]\n\n\nReinstatement of Prime Minister\nOn 21 November 2021, Hamdok was reinstated as prime minister after a political agreement was signed by Sudan's top general Abdel Fattah al-Burhan to restore the transition to civilian rule The 14-point deal called for the release of all political prisoners detained during the coup and stipulated that a 2019 constitutional declaration be the basis for a political transition However, the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) civilian coalition, which shared power with the military, and the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) both rejected the political deal [68] Large crowds of protestors also took to the streets to reject any deal involving the military [69]\n\n\nLegal issues\nOn 29 October, 27 lawyers and twelve citizens' groups including the Sudan Doctors Syndicate, the General Banks Union, the Darfur Bar Association, the Nuba Mountains Bar Association, the Women Lawyers Initiative for Change, the No to Oppression against Women Initiative, Women of Sudanese Civic and Political Groups (MANSAM) and the Khatim Adlan Centre for Enlightenment (KACE) called for al-Burhan to respect the draft constitutional document [73] In their view, the declaration of a state of emergency by al-Burhan, either in his role as the Sovereignty Council chair or as Commander-in-Chief of the Sudanese Armed forces, was illegal, and the suspension of Articles 11, 12, 15, 16 and 24, and items 3, 71 and 72 of the constitutional document was illegal [74]\n\n\nAnalysis\nAccording to The New York Times, factors motivating the military to halt the transition to democracy included their personal risk of national or international war crimes charges and their risk of losing control of the gold trade [51]\n\n\nInternational reactions\nThe coup, as well as the killings of civilian protestors, was denounced by some members of the international community [83] [84]\n\n\nOpposition to the coup\nThe coup, as well as the killings of civilian protestors, was denounced by some members of the international community [83] [84]\n\n\nStates and intergovernmental organizations\nThe coup, as well as the killings of civilian protestors, was denounced by some members of the international community [83] [84]\n\n\nCitizens' associations\nEdmund Yakani, leader of Community Empowerment for Progress Organization, a South Sudanese NGO, condemned the arrest of Hamdok [96] He said that the arrest of Hamdok, the chair of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), an eight-country regional trade bloc, was \"the first time in the continent that a sitting chair of a regional economic body like IGAD  [was] under detention.\" Yakani stated that Hamdok's arrest put at risk both the Sudanese peace process and the South Sudanese peace process, in which each country provided mediation for the other country's internal conflicts [97]\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**2021 Sudanese Coup d'état**\n\nThe 2021 Sudanese coup d'état was a military coup that took place on October 25, 2021, in Sudan.

The coup marked a significant setback for the country's transition to democracy, which had begun in 2019.\n\n**Background**\n\nPresident Omar al-Bashir, who had ruled the country since the 1989 coup, was overthrown by the military in April 2019 after weeks of mass protests.

The protestors, represented by the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC), agreed to a power-sharing deal with the military, creating the Sovereignty Council in August 2019. According to the TMC–FFC agreement, the transition process would last three years and three months, with the Sovereignty Council led by a military figure for 21 months, followed by a civilian leader for 18 months.\n\n**September Coup Attempt**\n\nIn September 2021, a military coup attempt was thwarted by the government. According to the Minister of Information, the perpetrators were \"remnants of the former regime\" who tried to take control of the state broadcasters and the military central command. Following the incident, 40 officers were arrested. Since then, tensions between the military and civilian leaders rose as military leaders started demanding reforms to the FFC coalition and called for the replacement of the cabinet.\n\n**October 2021 Pre-Coup Protests**\n\nOn October 16, pro-military protests organized by the Charter of the National Accord were held in Khartoum, during which protestors demanded a military coup. They were allowed to reach the gates of the presidential palace with a negligible police presence. The pro-military protesters continued their sit-in outside the presidential palace in Khartoum through to October 21.\n\n**Negotiations and Coup Proposal**\n\nSudanese prime minister Abdalla Hamdok tried negotiating between civilian and military groups following the September coup attempt.\n\n**Events**\n\nAround dawn on October 25, 2021, Sudan's military arrested at least five senior Sudanese government figures. Later, internet outages across Sudan were reported.\n\n**Coup Takes Place and Government Dissolved**\n\nAround dawn on October 25, 2021, Sudan's military arrested at least five senior Sudanese government figures. Later, internet outages across Sudan were reported.\n\n**Arrests of Government Members**\n\nMilitary forces placed civilian Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok under house arrest after besieging his home. Hamdok was pressured to make a statement supporting the coup, which he refused. He called for Sudanese to resist the coup and \"defend their revolution.\" In response to his refusal to support the coup, Hamdok was moved with his wife on October 25 to an unknown location. On October 26, al-Burhan said that Hamdok was being detained in al-Burhan's own home to protect Hamdok from \"danger.\"\n\n**Resistance to the Coup, Arrests, and Killings of Civilians**\n\nThe coup was met with resistance from pro-democracy Sudanese civilians, some of whom took to the streets of Khartoum in protest. The Sudanese Professionals Association and FFC, two of the coalitions that coordinated the Sudanese Revolution, called for mass civil disobedience and refusal to cooperate with the coup. The National Umma Party similarly denounced the arrests of the government ministers and called on the public to protest in the streets. The Sudanese Communist Party advocated for a workers' strike and mass civil disobedience.\n\n**Internet Outages**\n\nFollowing the coup, internet outages in Sudan were reported by international watchdog groups. The outages were later corroborated by the Sudan Information Ministry. The Sudanese Journalists Network interpreted the reason for the internet and telecommunications cutoffs to be the security forces' aim of \"commit [ting] more crimes against the Sudanese\" and hiding evidence of the security forces' involvement in attacks including the 3 June 2019 Khartoum massacre. On November 9, a judge in a Khartoum court ordered the country's major providers (MTN, Zain, and Sudani) to restore internet services immediately.\n\n**Media**\n\nGovernment-owned state television operated uninterrupted.\n\n**Government Ministries and Embassies**\n\nMariam al-Mahdi, Minister of Foreign Affairs, rejected the coup, stating that \"any coup in the country is rejected\" and that Sudanese would \"resist [the coup] by all civil means.\" She described the arrest of Hamdok as \"very dangerous and unacceptable.\" On October 26, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs supported al-Mahdi's earlier statement and al-Mahdi spoke directly to the Associated Press, stating \"We are still in our positions. We reject such coup and such unconstitutional measures.\"\n\n**Negotiations and Mediation**\n\nOn October 27, al-Burhan met with Volker Perthes, United Nations Special Representative and head of the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan (UNITAMS), in Khartoum. The army media office described the meeting as aiming to find \"ways to get out of the crisis in order to achieve stability and peace in the country,\" while Perthes referred to \"return [ing] to a comprehensive and urgent dialogue to restore partnership on the basis of the Constitutional Document and the Juba Peace Agreement.\" The following day, al-Burhan made a radio announcement declaring that Hamdok would be allowed to be restored as Prime Minister with a cabinet of his choosing, and the deposed official declined this initial offer, stating that he would only return to lead the government if the pre-coup system be restored. Al-Burhan responded by also proposing a new government led by an independent technocrat. Some observers judged that despite local and international efforts to mediate between al-Burhan's forces and civilian groups, there was little progress, as large sections of the Sudanese public appeared to be no longer willing to return to the pre-coup power-sharing system.\n\n**Reinstatement of Prime Minister**\n\nOn November 21, 2021, Hamdok was reinstated as prime minister after a political agreement was signed by Sudan's top general Abdel Fattah al-Burhan to restore the transition to civilian rule. The 14-point deal called for the release of all political prisoners detained during the coup and stipulated that a 2019 constitutional declaration be the basis for a political transition. However, the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) civilian coalition, which shared power with the military, and the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) both rejected the political deal. Large crowds of protestors also took to the streets to reject any deal involving the military.\n\n**Legal Issues**\n\nOn October 29, 27 lawyers and twelve citizens' groups including the Sudan Doctors Syndicate, the General Banks Union, the Darfur Bar Association, the Nuba Mountains Bar Association, the Women Lawyers Initiative for Change, the No to Oppression against Women Initiative, Women of Sudanese Civic and Political Groups (MANSAM) and the Khatim Adlan Centre for Enlightenment (KACE) called for al-Burhan to respect the draft constitutional document. In their view, the declaration of a state of emergency by al-Burhan, either in his role as the Sovereignty Council chair or as Commander-in-Chief of the Sudanese Armed forces, was illegal, and the suspension of Articles 11, 12, 15, 16 and 24, and items 3, 71 and 72 of the constitutional document was illegal.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nAccording to The New York Times, factors motivating the military to halt the transition to democracy included their personal risk of national or international war crimes charges and their risk of losing control of the gold trade.\n\n**International Reactions**\n\nThe coup, as well as the killings of civilian protestors, was denounced by some members of the international community.\n\n**Opposition to the Coup**\n\nThe coup, as well as the killings of civilian protestors, was denounced by some members of the international community.\n\n**States and Intergovernmental Organizations**\n\nThe coup, as well as the killings of civilian protestors, was denounced by some members of the international community.\n\n**Citizens' Associations**\n\nEdmund Yakani, leader of Community Empowerment for Progress Organization, a South Sudanese NGO, condemned the arrest of Hamdok. He said that the arrest of Hamdok, the chair of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), an eight-country regional trade bloc, was \"the first time in the continent that a sitting chair of a regional economic body like IGAD [was] under detention.\" Yakani stated that Hamdok's arrest put at risk both the Sudanese peace process and the South Sudanese peace process, in which each country provided mediation for the other country's internal conflicts.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2021_Sudanese_coup_d'état\" following this

was a renowned American comedian, writer, and actor who gained fame for his raw, unapologetic humor and unflinching commentary on racism and social justice. Born in 1941 in Shreveport, Louisiana, Mooney's life was marked by both triumph and tragedy, as he navigated the complexities of fame, family, and identity.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nMooney was born to George Gladney and LaVoya Ealy, and his early life was significantly influenced by his grandmother, Aimay Ealy, whom he affectionately referred to as \"Mama.\" Growing up, Mooney was a creative and curious child, often entertaining his family with jokes and storytelling. His parents eventually relocated to Oakland, California, when Mooney was seven years old, where he would grow up to develop his unique perspective on the world.\n\n**Career**\n\nMooney's entry into the entertainment industry began with a stint as a ringmaster with the Gatti-Charles Circus. During this time, he honed his writing skills and developed his comedic style, which would later become the hallmark of his career. In 1977, Mooney began working as a writer for Richard Pryor, a collaboration that would shape the course of his life and career.\n\nIn the 1980s, Mooney became a regular fixture on the comedy circuit, performing at iconic venues like the Comedy Store in Los Angeles. He was known for his biting social commentary, which often targeted racism, police brutality, and systemic oppression.

The segment, which included \"nominees\" like Michael Jackson, Oprah Winfrey, and Diana Ross, was met with both laughter and outrage. Mooney's humor was unflinching, and he made no apologies for his critiques.\n\n**The N-Word**\n\nIn 2006, Mooney appeared on CNN, where he announced that he would stop using the word \"nigga\" due to Michael Richards' infamous outbursts on stage at the Laugh Factory. Mooney referred to Richards as \"his Dr. Phil\" and \"cured\" him of the use of the epithet. This move was seen as a bold statement, as Mooney was one of the few comedians who had made a career out of using the word in his performances.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nMooney's personal life was marked by both joy and tragedy. In an August 2019 interview with Comedy Hype, Richard Pryor's ex-bodyguard, Rashon Khan, alleged that Mooney had molested Pryor's son, Richard Pryor Jr., when Pryor Jr. was a child. Khan also alleged that Pryor had expressed a desire to have Mooney killed in a murder-for-hire plot over this incident. Richard Pryor Jr. has confirmed that he was raped, but did not mention Mooney by name as his alleged rapist.\n\n**Death**\n\nOn May 19, 2021, Mooney passed away at the age of 79 due to a heart attack at his home in Oakland, California. His death was met with an outpouring of tributes and condolences from the comedy community, with many paying homage to his unique style and unflinching commentary on social justice.\n\n**Filmography**\n\nMooney's filmography includes a range of projects, from documentaries to scripted films. His collaborations with Richard Pryor are particularly notable, as they reflect Mooney's unique perspective on the world. Mooney also appeared in several television shows, including \"Chappelle's Show\" and \"Def Comedy Jam.\"\n\n**Bibliography**\n\nMooney's written works include his memoir, \"Black Is the New White,\" which offers a candid look at his life and career. The book features a foreword written by Dave Chappelle and offers insights into Mooney's experiences as a comedian, writer, and actor.\n\nIn conclusion, Paul Mooney was a trailblazing comedian, writer, and actor who left an indelible mark on the entertainment industry.

If it is determined that there has been a violation of federal law, criminal charges will be sought\" [59] [130] [131]\n\n\nFailed plea bargain\nOn May 28, state and federal prosecutors held a press conference at a regional FBI office in Brooklyn Center, a Minneapolis suburb, in what was anticipated to be a major development in the case against the officers at the scene of Floyd's murder [132] Hennepin County Attorney Michael O Freeman, the local official with jurisdiction to bring criminal charges for police misconduct, said his office needed more time to investigate [133] In explaining the anticipation of the media briefing and its two-hour delayed start, U.S Attorney Erica MacDonald said, \"I thought we would have another development to talk to you about, but we don't.\" On June 9, it was revealed that state and federal prosecutors had discussed a plea deal with Chauvin that would have included state murder charges and federal civil rights charges, [132] but the deal fell apart when United States Attorney General William Barr rejected it [134] Chauvin believed his prospects of winning at trial could be poor, and was willing to plead guilty to third-degree murder for a ten-year prison sentence As he would have gone to federal prison, the federal government was involved Barr worried that protesters might view the agreement as too lenient and prefer a full investigation [134]\n\n\nState criminal charges\nOn May 29, Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter and held at Oak Park Heights state prison According to the criminal complaint, police are trained that the neck restraint that he applied \"with a subject in prone position is inherently dangerous\" [135] He was the first officer in Minnesota to be charged in the death of a black civilian [136] [137] On June 3, the charge against Chauvin was upgraded to second-degree murder, and the three other officers were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder as well as aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter [138] [d] The officers were held in jail after the state criminal charges were filed Before the trials, the four officers were released on bail Lane was released on June 10, [140] [141] Kueng on June 19, [142] and Thao on July 4 [143] Chauvin was released on October 7 after posting a $1 million bond [144]\n\n\nState civil rights action\nOn June 2, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights opened an investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department's practices [145] [146] On June 5, the Minneapolis City Council authorized the mayor to enter a restraining order with the State of Minnesota banning chokeholds and neck restraints, requiring police officers to intervene against other officers' use of excessive force, and requiring authorization from the police chief or designate before using crowd-control weapons such as chemical agents and rubber bullets [147] [148] On June 8, a Hennepin County Court judge ordered the Minneapolis Police Department to cooperate with a civil rights investigation, and extended the restrictions on the department to require that the chief make discipline decisions in a timely and transparent manner, and that civilian analysts and investigators in the city's Office of Police Conduct Review be given authority to audit body-worn camera footage and to file or amend complaints on behalf of the Minneapolis Civil Rights Department [149] [150] [151]\n\n\nFederal civil rights charges\nIn February 2021, the United States Department of Justice empaneled a grand jury in Minneapolis as part of a federal investigation into Chauvin [154] On May 7, 2021, all four officers were indicted on federal charges of civil rights violations [155] Chauvin was indicted for violating Floyd's civil rights, along with those of a teenager who survived a similar restraint in 2017 [156] The other three officers also faced charges for violating Floyd's civil rights Thao, Lane, and Kueng appeared at a hearing virtually, and each posted $25,000 bond Chauvin did not appear at this hearing, and remained in jail while awaiting sentencing for his state charges [156]\n\n\nCivil litigation and settlement\nIn July 2020, Floyd's family filed a wrongful death lawsuit in federal court against the City of Minneapolis and the four officers involved in the murder The complaint said Floyd's Fourth Amendment rights were violated by \"excessive use of unjustified, excessive, illegal, and deadly force\" The lawsuit did not specify the amount of monetary damages the family sought [157]\n\n\nTrials and plea agreements\nChauvin's trial commenced in Minneapolis on March 8, 2021, in Hennepin County District Court [159] Opening statements occurred on March 29, 2021, and closing arguments on April 19, 2021.\n\n\nCriminal trial of Chauvin\nChauvin's trial commenced in Minneapolis on March 8, 2021, in Hennepin County District Court [159] Opening statements occurred on March 29, 2021, and closing arguments on April 19, 2021.\n\n\nFederal civil rights proceedings\nThe federal civil rights trial was initially scheduled to include all four officers—Chauvin, Kueng, Lane, and Thao—and begin in January 2022 with U.S District Judge Paul A Magnuson presiding The four officers were charged federally with abusing their positions as police officers, depriving Floyd of his constitutional rights to be \"free from the use of unreasonable force\", and failing to give medical aid All four officers pled not guilty to the charges at a September 14, 2021, arraignment hearing Chauvin faced an additional federal charge for a 2017 arrest incident of a 14-year old in Minneapolis that he initially pled not guilty to [30] [173] [174] In late 2020, prior to the trial, lawyers for Thao, Lane, and Kueng had sought to sever their case from Chauvin's In a hearing on November 29, 2021, Magnuson ruled that all four officers would stand trial together [173]\n\n\nChauvin pleads guilty\nChauvin requested a hearing in December 2021 to offer a revised plea to the federal charges, a legal move that did not apply to the other three officers [175] He pled guilty on December 15, 2021, to the federal charges of violating the rights of Floyd and for the charge related to the 2017 incident [31] Chauvin admitted to willfully violating Floyd's constitutional right to be free from unreasonable seizure, including the right to be free from unreasonable force by a police officer [31] Chauvin also admitted to willfully violating Floyd's constitutional right not to be deprived of liberty without due process of law, including the right to be free from a police officer's deliberate indifference to Floyd's serious medical needs [32] On July 7, 2022, Judge Magnuson sentenced Chauvin to 21 years, with roughly 17 incarcerated and 5 under supervised release, that will be served concurrently with his state criminal sentence [176] In mid-November 2023, Chauvin filed a motion in federal court to vacate his guilty plea [177] [178]\n\n\nTrial of Kueng, Lane, and Thao\nThe federal civil rights trial of Kueng, Lane, and Thao was held at a courtroom in the Warren E Burger Federal Building in Saint Paul, Minnesota [173] [179] Jury selection began on January 20, 2022, [180] and opening statements were given by both sides on January 24 [181] [182] The 12-person jury seated for the trial was drawn from across Minnesota The racial makeup of the jury was described by The New York Times as appearing to be all-white, a contrast to the more racially diverse jury during Chauvin's criminal trial [183]\n\n\nCriminal proceedings for Kueng, Lane, and Thao\nThe state criminal trial of Kueng, Lane, and Thao was delayed several times to allow the federal civil rights case to proceed first [205] In a ruling on April 26, 2022, Judge Peter Cahill, who also presided over Chauvin's trial, ordered that the proceedings of the trial would not be livestreamed, a move that media organizations criticized [206]\n\n\nKueng and Lane plead guilty\nThe state criminal trial of Kueng, Lane, and Thao was delayed several times to allow the federal civil rights case to proceed first [205] In a ruling on April 26, 2022, Judge Peter Cahill, who also presided over Chauvin's trial, ordered that the proceedings of the trial would not be livestreamed, a move that media organizations criticized [206]\n\n\nEvidentiary trial of Thao\nThe same day Kueng pleaded guilty, on October 24, 2022, Thao waived his right to a jury trial in lieu of a trial by stipulated evidence The legal move required attorneys to submit evidence to the court for review by Peter Cahill, the same judge as in Chauvin's criminal trial [214] Thao was held in a Hennepin County jail while awaiting the outcome If found guilty, he faced a potential state sentence from three to five years [36] [37] [215]\n\n\nReaction\nFloyd's murder resulted in a global protest movement against historic racism and police brutality In the United States, protests of racial injustice in mid 2020 were the largest since the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s, and gave way to widespread civil unrest [217] Protests began locally on May 26 in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area before quickly, within a few days, spreading nationwide and in over 60 countries internationally supporting Black Lives Matter Over 2,000 cities in the United States had seen demonstrations as of June 13 [218] [219] Many of the demonstrations involved die-ins, with protestors lying down for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, the length of time initial reports said Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck [220] While the majority of protests were peaceful, [221] demonstrations in some cities descended into riots and looting, [222] [223] with more being marked by street skirmishes and significant police brutality, notably against peaceful protesters and reporters [224] [225] At least 200 cities in the U.S had imposed curfews by June 3, while more than 30 states and Washington, D.C., activated over 62,000 National Guard personnel due to the mass unrest [226] [227] [228]\n\n\nProtests\nFloyd's murder resulted in a global protest movement

the location where Floyd was murdered became a makeshift memorial throughout May 26, with many placards paying tribute to him and referencing the Black Lives Matter movement [247] As the day progressed, more people came to demonstrate against Floyd's murder Hundreds of people, [248] [249] [233] [250] then marched to the 3rd Precinct of the Minneapolis Police [233] Participants used posters and slogans with phrases such as \"Justice for George\", \"I can't breathe\", and \"Black Lives Matter\" [251] On September 18, the Minneapolis City Council approved designating the section of Chicago Avenue between 37th and 39th Streets as George Perry Floyd Jr Place, with a marker at the intersection with 38th Street where the incident took place The intersection has been closed and occupied by demonstrators who said they will not leave until their demands regarding anti-racism and property tax are met [252]\n\n\nOther reactions\nA variety of people and organizations reacted to Floyd's murder Numerous statues and monuments honoring persons or events associated with slavery and racism were vandalized, removed, or destroyed during the protests in the U.S and

killing of George Floyd was a highly publicized incident that occurred on May 25, 2020, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where a black American man, George Perry Floyd Jr., was murdered by a white police officer, Derek Chauvin. The incident sparked widespread protests and civil unrest across the United States and around the world, drawing attention to systemic racism and police brutality.\n\n**People involved**\n\nGeorge Perry Floyd Jr. was a 46-year-old black American born in Fayetteville, North Carolina, and raised in the Third Ward of Houston, Texas. In 2014, he moved to the Minneapolis area and resided in the suburb of St Louis Park. He was a frequent customer at the Cup Foods convenience store in Powderhorn Park, Minneapolis.\n\nDerek Chauvin, a 44-year-old white American, was a police officer who had served in the Minneapolis Police Department since 2001. Chauvin and Floyd sometimes worked overlapping shifts as security guards for a local nightclub, but the extent of their acquaintance was unclear.\n\nTou Thao, a 34-year-old Hmong-American, was a police officer who had started as a part-time community service officer in 2008 and graduated from the police academy in 2009. Thao had six complaints filed against him, none resulting in disciplinary action.\n\nJ. Alexander Kueng, a 26-year-old black American, and Thomas Kiernan Lane, a 37-year-old white American, were licensed as law enforcement officers in August 2019. They had trained together and were in their first week as Minneapolis police officers when Floyd was murdered.\n\n**Arrest and murder**\n\nOn the evening of May 25, 2020, Floyd purchased cigarettes at Cup Foods, a grocery store at the intersection of East 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis's Powderhorn Park neighborhood. A store employee believed Floyd had paid with a counterfeit $20 bill and called the police to report the incident. The police arrived and approached Floyd, who became resistant and was handcuffed. Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck while Kueng and Lane held him down, and Thao stood nearby.\n\n**Initial events**\n\nThe police officers were responding to a report of a counterfeit bill, but they escalated the situation, leading to Floyd's death. The officers were seen on video footage kneeling on Floyd's neck, with Chauvin applying pressure to Floyd's neck while Kueng and Lane held him down.\n\n**Medical response and death**\n\nAt 8:27, a Hennepin County ambulance arrived, and emergency medical technicians checked Floyd's pulse. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for almost a minute after the ambulance arrived, despite Floyd being silent and motionless. Floyd died at the scene.\n\n**Investigations and criminal charges**\n\nThe Minneapolis Police Department initially issued a statement that said nothing about Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck, but later updated their statement to reflect the new information. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) joined the investigation, and Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The three other officers were also charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin was held in jail until his trial.\n\n**State civil rights action**\n\nThe Minnesota Department of Human Rights opened an investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department's practices, and a Hennepin County Court judge ordered the police department to cooperate with the investigation.\n\n**Federal civil rights charges**\n\nIn February 2021, the United States Department of Justice empaneled a grand jury in Minneapolis as part of a federal investigation into Chauvin. All four officers were indicted on federal charges of civil rights violations. Chauvin pleaded guilty to the federal charges, admitting to willfully violating Floyd's constitutional rights.\n\n**Trials and plea agreements**\n\nChauvin's trial commenced in March 2021, and he was found guilty of second-degree murder. Kueng, Lane, and Thao were also found guilty of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin was sentenced to 22.5 years in prison, and the three other officers were sentenced to prison terms ranging from three to five years.\n\n**Protests**\n\nThe killing of George Floyd sparked widespread protests and civil unrest across the United States and around the world. Protests began locally in Minneapolis and quickly spread to other cities, with over 2,000 cities in the United States seeing demonstrations. The protests were marked by die-ins, with protesters lying down for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, the length of time Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck.\n\n**Memorials**\n\nThe area near the location where Floyd was murdered became a makeshift memorial, with placards paying tribute to him and referencing the Black Lives Matter movement. The intersection of Chicago Avenue and 38th Street was designated as George Perry Floyd Jr Place, with a marker at the intersection where the incident took place.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe killing of George Floyd led to a federal review of the Minneapolis Police Department, which found a pattern and practice of using deadly and other force excessively. The review also found that the police department disproportionately searched and stopped black and Native American people, violated the free-speech rights of protesters, and discriminated against people with behavioral health disabilities during emergency responses. The incident led to widespread calls for change and reform in policing practices.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Black Lives Matter movement\n* Police brutality in the United States\n* Systemic racism in the United States\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* \"The Killing of George Floyd: A Timeline\" by The New York Times\n* \"George Floyd's Murder Sparks Global Protests\" by Al Jazeera\n* \"The Minneapolis Police Department's Handling of George Floyd's Death\" by The Washington Post\n* \"The Investigation into George Floyd's Death\" by The Guardian\n\n**External links**\n\n* \"The Killing of George Floyd\" by The Minneapolis Police Department\n* \"George Floyd's Murder\" by the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n* \"The Minneapolis Police Department's Response to the Killing of George Floyd\" by the Hennepin County Attorney's Office", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Killing_of_George_Floyd\" following this outline:\n\n\nPeople involved\nGeorge Perry Floyd Jr was a 46-year-old black American born in Fayetteville, North Carolina, and raised in the Third Ward [41] of Houston, Texas [42] [43] [44] In 2014, he moved to the Minneapolis area [45] He resided in the suburb of St Louis Park, and was a frequent customer at the Cup Foods  convenience store in Powderhorn Park, Minneapolis [46]\n\n\nGeorge Floyd\nGeorge Perry Floyd Jr was a 46-year-old black American born in Fayetteville, North Carolina, and raised in the Third Ward [41] of Houston, Texas [42] [43] [44] In 2014, he moved to the Minneapolis area [45] He resided in the suburb of St Louis Park, and was a frequent customer at the Cup Foods  convenience store in Powderhorn Park, Minneapolis [46]\n\n\nDerek Chauvin\nAt the time of Floyd's murder, Derek Michael Chauvin, a white American, [47] was a 44-year-old police officer who had served in the Minneapolis Police Department since 2001 [48] [49] Chauvin and Floyd sometimes worked overlapping shifts as security guards for a local nightclub, but the club's former owner was unsure of the extent of their acquaintance [50] [51]\n\n\nTou Thao\nTou Thao, a Hmong-American, [52] was 34 at the time of Floyd's murder and started as a part-time community service officer in 2008 He graduated from the police academy in 2009 After a two-year layoff, he resumed police work in 2012 [48] [53] Six complaints had been filed against Thao, none resulting in disciplinary action In 2014, a man claimed Thao handcuffed him without cause, threw him to the ground, and punched, kicked, and kneed him; the man's teeth were broken and he was hospitalized [48] [54] The resulting lawsuit was settled for $25,000 [48] During the Floyd arrest Thao kept bystanders away He was found guilty of violating Floyd's civil rights [55]\n\n\nJ.

If it is determined that there has been a violation of federal law, criminal charges will be sought\" [59] [130] [131]\n\n\nFailed plea bargain\nOn May 28, state and federal prosecutors held a press conference at a regional FBI office in Brooklyn Center, a Minneapolis suburb, in what was anticipated to be a major development in the case against the officers at the scene of Floyd's murder [132] Hennepin County Attorney Michael O Freeman, the local official with jurisdiction to bring criminal charges for police misconduct, said his office needed more time to investigate [133] In explaining the anticipation of the media briefing and its two-hour delayed start, U.S Attorney Erica MacDonald said, \"I thought we would have another development to talk to you about, but we don't.\" On June 9, it was revealed that state and federal prosecutors had discussed a plea deal with Chauvin that would have included state murder charges and federal civil rights charges, [132] but the deal fell apart when United States Attorney General William Barr rejected it [134] Chauvin believed his prospects of winning at trial could be poor, and was willing to plead guilty to third-degree murder for a ten-year prison sentence As he would have gone to federal prison, the federal government was involved Barr worried that protesters might view the agreement as too lenient and prefer a full investigation [134]\n\n\nState criminal charges\nOn May 29, Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter and held at Oak Park Heights state prison According to the criminal complaint, police are trained that the neck restraint that he applied \"with a subject in prone position is inherently dangerous\" [135] He was the first officer in Minnesota to be charged in the death of a black civilian [136] [137] On June 3, the charge against Chauvin was upgraded to second-degree murder, and the three other officers were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder as well as aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter [138] [d] The officers were held in jail after the state criminal charges were filed Before the trials, the four officers were released on bail Lane was released on June 10, [140] [141] Kueng on June 19, [142] and Thao on July 4 [143] Chauvin was released on October 7 after posting a $1 million bond [144]\n\n\nState civil rights action\nOn June 2, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights opened an investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department's practices [145] [146] On June 5, the Minneapolis City Council authorized the mayor to enter a restraining order with the State of Minnesota banning chokeholds and neck restraints, requiring police officers to intervene against other officers' use of excessive force, and requiring authorization from the police chief or designate before using crowd-control weapons such as chemical agents and rubber bullets [147] [148] On June 8, a Hennepin County Court judge ordered the Minneapolis Police Department to cooperate with a civil rights investigation, and extended the restrictions on the department to require that the chief make discipline decisions in a timely and transparent manner, and that civilian analysts and investigators in the city's Office of Police Conduct Review be given authority to audit body-worn camera footage and to file or amend complaints on behalf of the Minneapolis Civil Rights Department [149] [150] [151]\n\n\nFederal civil rights charges\nIn February 2021, the United States Department of Justice empaneled a grand jury in Minneapolis as part of a federal investigation into Chauvin [154] On May 7, 2021, all four officers were indicted on federal charges of civil rights violations [155] Chauvin was indicted for violating Floyd's civil rights, along with those of a teenager who survived a similar restraint in 2017 [156] The other three officers also faced charges for violating Floyd's civil rights Thao, Lane, and Kueng appeared at a hearing virtually, and each posted $25,000 bond Chauvin did not appear at this hearing, and remained in jail while awaiting sentencing for his state charges [156]\n\n\nCivil litigation and settlement\nIn July 2020, Floyd's family filed a wrongful death lawsuit in federal court against the City of Minneapolis and the four officers involved in the murder The complaint said Floyd's Fourth Amendment rights were violated by \"excessive use of unjustified, excessive, illegal, and deadly force\" The lawsuit did not specify the amount of monetary damages the family sought [157]\n\n\nTrials and plea agreements\nChauvin's trial commenced in Minneapolis on March 8, 2021, in Hennepin County District Court [159] Opening statements occurred on March 29, 2021, and closing arguments on April 19, 2021.\n\n\nCriminal trial of Chauvin\nChauvin's trial commenced in Minneapolis on March 8, 2021, in Hennepin County District Court [159] Opening statements occurred on March 29, 2021, and closing arguments on April 19, 2021.\n\n\nFederal civil rights proceedings\nThe federal civil rights trial was initially scheduled to include all four officers—Chauvin, Kueng, Lane, and Thao—and begin in January 2022 with U.S District Judge Paul A Magnuson presiding The four officers were charged federally with abusing their positions as police officers, depriving Floyd of his constitutional rights to be \"free from the use of unreasonable force\", and failing to give medical aid All four officers pled not guilty to the charges at a September 14, 2021, arraignment hearing Chauvin faced an additional federal charge for a 2017 arrest incident of a 14-year old in Minneapolis that he initially pled not guilty to [30] [173] [174] In late 2020, prior to the trial, lawyers for Thao, Lane, and Kueng had sought to sever their case from Chauvin's In a hearing on November 29, 2021, Magnuson ruled that all four officers would stand trial together [173]\n\n\nChauvin pleads guilty\nChauvin requested a hearing in December 2021 to offer a revised plea to the federal charges, a legal move that did not apply to the other three officers [175] He pled guilty on December 15, 2021, to the federal charges of violating the rights of Floyd and for the charge related to the 2017 incident [31] Chauvin admitted to willfully violating Floyd's constitutional right to be free from unreasonable seizure, including the right to be free from unreasonable force by a police officer [31] Chauvin also admitted to willfully violating Floyd's constitutional right not to be deprived of liberty without due process of law, including the right to be free from a police officer's deliberate indifference to Floyd's serious medical needs [32] On July 7, 2022, Judge Magnuson sentenced Chauvin to 21 years, with roughly 17 incarcerated and 5 under supervised release, that will be served concurrently with his state criminal sentence [176] In mid-November 2023, Chauvin filed a motion in federal court to vacate his guilty plea [177] [178]\n\n\nTrial of Kueng, Lane, and Thao\nThe federal civil rights trial of Kueng, Lane, and Thao was held at a courtroom in the Warren E Burger Federal Building in Saint Paul, Minnesota [173] [179] Jury selection began on January 20, 2022, [180] and opening statements were given by both sides on January 24 [181] [182] The 12-person jury seated for the trial was drawn from across Minnesota The racial makeup of the jury was described by The New York Times as appearing to be all-white, a contrast to the more racially diverse jury during Chauvin's criminal trial [183]\n\n\nCriminal proceedings for Kueng, Lane, and Thao\nThe state criminal trial of Kueng, Lane, and Thao was delayed several times to allow the federal civil rights case to proceed first [205] In a ruling on April 26, 2022, Judge Peter Cahill, who also presided over Chauvin's trial, ordered that the proceedings of the trial would not be livestreamed, a move that media organizations criticized [206]\n\n\nKueng and Lane plead guilty\nThe state criminal trial of Kueng, Lane, and Thao was delayed several times to allow the federal civil rights case to proceed first [205] In a ruling on April 26, 2022, Judge Peter Cahill, who also presided over Chauvin's trial, ordered that the proceedings of the trial would not be livestreamed, a move that media organizations criticized [206]\n\n\nEvidentiary trial of Thao\nThe same day Kueng pleaded guilty, on October 24, 2022, Thao waived his right to a jury trial in lieu of a trial by stipulated evidence The legal move required attorneys to submit evidence to the court for review by Peter Cahill, the same judge as in Chauvin's criminal trial [214] Thao was held in a Hennepin County jail while awaiting the outcome If found guilty, he faced a potential state sentence from three to five years [36] [37] [215]\n\n\nReaction\nFloyd's murder resulted in a global protest movement against historic racism and police brutality In the United States, protests of racial injustice in mid 2020 were the largest since the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s, and gave way to widespread civil unrest [217] Protests began

posters and slogans with phrases such as \"Justice for George\", \"I can't breathe\", and \"Black Lives Matter\" [251] On September 18, the Minneapolis City Council approved designating the section of Chicago Avenue between 37th and 39th Streets as George Perry Floyd Jr Place, with a marker at the intersection with 38th Street where the incident took place The intersection has been closed and occupied by demonstrators who said they will not leave until their demands regarding anti-racism and property tax are met [252]\n\n\nOther reactions\nA variety of people and organizations reacted to

{"title": "Elizabeth_I", "content": "\nEarly life\nElizabeth was born at Greenwich Palace on 7 September 1533 and was named after her grandmothers, Elizabeth of York and Lady Elizabeth Howard [6] She was the second child of Henry VIII of England born in wedlock to survive infancy Her mother was Henry VIII's second wife, Anne Boleyn At birth, Elizabeth was the heir presumptive to the English throne Her elder half-sister Mary had lost her position as a legitimate heir when Henry annulled his marriage to Mary's mother, Catherine of Aragon, to marry Anne, with the intent to sire a male heir and ensure the Tudor succession [7] [8] She was baptised on 10 September 1533, and her godparents were Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury; Henry Courtenay, Marquess of Exeter; Elizabeth Stafford, Duchess of Norfolk; and Margaret Wotton, Dowager Marchioness of Dorset A canopy was carried at the ceremony over the infant by her uncle George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford; John Hussey, Baron Hussey of Sleaford; Lord Thomas Howard; and William Howard, Baron Howard of Effingham [9]\n\n\nThomas Seymour\nHenry VIII died in 1547 and Elizabeth's half-brother, Edward VI, became king at the age of nine Catherine Parr, Henry's widow, soon married Thomas Seymour, Baron Seymour of Sudeley, Edward VI's uncle and the brother of Lord Protector Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset The couple took Elizabeth into their household at Chelsea There Elizabeth experienced an emotional crisis that some historians believe affected her for the rest of her life [23] Thomas Seymour engaged in romps and horseplay with the 14-year-old Elizabeth, including entering her bedroom in his nightgown, tickling her, and slapping her on the buttocks Elizabeth rose early and surrounded herself with maids to avoid his unwelcome morning visits Parr, rather than confront her husband over his inappropriate activities, joined in Twice she accompanied him in tickling Elizabeth, and once held her while he cut her black gown \"into a thousand pieces\" [24] However, after Parr discovered the pair in an embrace, she ended this state of affairs [25] In May 1548, Elizabeth was sent away.\n\n\nReign of Mary I\nEdward VI died on 6 July 1553, aged 15 His will ignored the Succession to the Crown Act 1543, excluded both Mary and Elizabeth from the succession, and instead declared as his heir Lady Jane Grey, granddaughter of Henry VIII's younger sister Mary Tudor, Queen of France Jane was proclaimed queen by the privy council, but her support quickly crumbled, and she was deposed after nine days On 3 August 1553, Mary rode triumphantly into London, with Elizabeth at her side [d]\nThe show of solidarity between the sisters did not last long Mary, a devout Catholic, was determined to crush the Protestant faith in which Elizabeth had been educated, and she ordered that everyone attend Catholic Mass; Elizabeth had to outwardly conform Mary's initial popularity ebbed away in 1554 when she announced plans to marry Philip of Spain, the son of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and an active Catholic [33] Discontent spread rapidly through the country, and many looked to Elizabeth as a focus for their opposition to Mary's religious policies.\n\n\nAccession\nElizabeth became queen at the age of 25, and declared her intentions to her council and other peers who had come to Hatfield to swear allegiance The speech contains the first record of her adoption of the medieval political theology of the sovereign's \"two bodies\": the body natural and the body politic: [45]\n\n\nChurch settlement\nElizabeth's personal religious convictions have been much debated by scholars She was a Protestant, but kept Catholic symbols (such as the crucifix), and downplayed the role of sermons in defiance of a key Protestant belief [53]\n\n\nMarriage question\nFrom the start of Elizabeth's reign it was expected that she would marry, and the question arose to whom Although she received many offers, she never married and remained childless; the reasons for this are not clear Historians have speculated that Thomas Seymour had put her off sexual relationships [59] [60] She considered several suitors until she was about 50 years old Her last courtship was with Francis, Duke of Anjou, 22 years her junior While risking possible loss of power like her sister, who played into the hands of King Philip II of Spain, marriage offered the chance of an heir [61] However, the choice of a husband might also provoke political instability or even insurrection [62]\n\n\nRobert Dudley\nIn the spring of 1559, it became evident that Elizabeth was in love with her childhood friend Robert Dudley [63] It was said that his wife Amy was suffering from a \"malady in one of her breasts\" and that the queen would like to marry Robert if his wife should die [64] By the autumn of 1559, several foreign suitors were vying for Elizabeth's hand; their impatient envoys engaged in ever more scandalous talk and reported that a marriage with her favourite was not welcome in England: [65] \"There is not a man who does not cry out on him and her with indignation .. she will marry none but the favoured Robert.\" [66] Amy Dudley died in September 1560, from a fall from a flight of stairs and, despite the coroner's inquest finding of accident, many people suspected her husband of having arranged her death so that he could marry the queen [67] [h] Elizabeth seriously considered marrying Dudley for some time However, William Cecil, Nicholas Throckmorton, and some conservative peers made their disapproval unmistakably clear [70] There were even rumours that the nobility would rise if the marriage took place [71]\n\n\nForeign candidates\nMarriage negotiations constituted a key element in Elizabeth's foreign policy [77] She turned down the hand of Philip, her half-sister's widower, early in 1559 but for several years entertained the proposal of King Eric XIV of Sweden [78] [79] [80] Earlier in Elizabeth's life, a Danish match for her had been discussed; Henry VIII had proposed one with the Danish prince Adolf, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, in 1545, and Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, suggested a marriage with Prince Frederick (later Frederick II) several years later, but the negotiations had abated in 1551 [81] In the years around 1559, a Dano-English Protestant alliance was considered, [82] and to counter Sweden's proposal, King Frederick II proposed to Elizabeth in late 1559 [81]\n\n\nVirginity\nElizabeth's unmarried status inspired a cult of virginity related to that of the Virgin Mary In poetry and portraiture, she was depicted as a virgin, a goddess, or both, not as a normal woman [91] At first, only Elizabeth made a virtue of her ostensible virginity: in 1559, she told the Commons, \"And, in the end, this shall be for me sufficient, that a marble stone shall declare that a queen, having reigned such a time, lived and died a virgin\" [92] Later on, poets and writers took up the theme and developed an iconography that exalted Elizabeth Public tributes to the Virgin by 1578 acted as a coded assertion of opposition to the queen's marriage negotiations with the Duke of Alençon [93] Ultimately, Elizabeth would insist she was married to her kingdom and subjects, under divine protection In 1599, she spoke of \"all my husbands, my good people\" [94]\n\n\nMary, Queen of Scots\nElizabeth's first policy toward Scotland was to oppose the French presence there [104] She feared that the French planned to invade England and put her Catholic cousin Mary, Queen of Scots, on the throne Mary was considered by many to be the heir to the English crown, being the granddaughter of Henry VIII's elder sister, Margaret Mary boasted being \"the nearest kinswoman she hath\" [105] [i] Elizabeth was persuaded to send a force into Scotland to aid the Protestant rebels, and though the campaign was inept, the resulting Treaty of Edinburgh of July 1560 removed the French threat in the north [j] When Mary returned from France to Scotland in 1561 to take up the reins of power, the country had an established Protestant church and was run by a council of Protestant nobles supported by Elizabeth [107] Mary refused to ratify the treaty [108]\n\n\nCatholic cause\nMary was soon the focus for rebellion In 1569 there was a major Catholic rising in the North; the goal was to free Mary, marry her to Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, and put her on the English throne [112] After the rebels' defeat, over 750 of them were executed on Elizabeth's orders [113] In the belief that the revolt had been successful, Pope Pius V issued a bull in 1570, titled Regnans in Excelsis, which declared \"Elizabeth, the pretended Queen of England and the servant of crime\" to be excommunicated and a heretic, releasing all her subjects from any allegiance to her [114] [115] Catholics who obeyed her orders were threatened with excommunication [114] The papal bull provoked legislative initiatives against Catholics by Parliament, which were, however, mitigated by Elizabeth's intervention [116] In 1581, to convert English subjects to Catholicism with \"the intent\" to withdraw them from their allegiance to Elizabeth was made a treasonable offence, carrying the death penalty [117] From the 1570s missionary priests from continental seminaries went to England secretly in the cause of the \"reconversion of England\" [115] Some were executed for treasonable conduct, engendering a cult of martyrdom [115]\n\n\nWars and overseas trade\nElizabeth's foreign policy was largely defensive The exception was the English occupation of Le Havre from October 1562 to June 1563, which ended in failure when Elizabeth's Huguenot allies joined with the Catholics to retake the port Elizabeth's intention had been to exchange Le Havre for Calais, lost to France in January 1558 [121] Only through the activities of her fleets did Elizabeth pursue an aggressive policy This paid off in the war against Spain, 80% of which was fought at sea [122] She knighted Francis Drake after his circumnavigation of the globe from 1577 to 1580, and he won fame for his raids on Spanish ports and fleets An element of piracy and self-enrichment drove Elizabethan seafarers, over whom the queen had little control [123] [124]\n\n\nNetherlands\nAfter the occupation and loss of Le Havre in 1562–1563, Elizabeth avoided military expeditions on the continent until 1585, when she sent an English army to aid the Protestant Dutch rebels against Philip II [125] This followed the deaths in 1584 of the queen's allies William the Silent, Prince of Orange, and the Duke of Anjou, and the surrender of a series of Dutch towns to Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, Philip's governor of the Spanish Netherlands In December 1584, an alliance between Philip II and the French Catholic League at Joinville undermined the ability of Anjou's brother, Henry III of France, to counter Spanish domination of the Netherlands It also extended Spanish influence along the channel coast of France, where the Catholic League was strong, and exposed England to invasion [125] The siege of Antwerp in the summer of 1585 by the Duke of Parma necessitated some reaction on the part of the English and the Dutch The outcome was the Treaty of Nonsuch of August 1585, in which Elizabeth promised military support to the Dutch [126] The treaty marked the beginning of the Anglo-Spanish War, which lasted until the Treaty of London in 1604.\n\n\nSpanish Armada\nMeanwhile, Francis Drake had undertaken a major voyage against Spanish ports and ships in the Caribbean in 1585 and 1586 In 1587 he made a successful raid on Cádiz, destroying the Spanish fleet of war ships intended for the Enterprise of England, [135] as Philip II had decided to take the war to England [136]\n\n\nFrance\nWhen the Protestant Henry IV inherited the French throne in 1589, Elizabeth sent him military support It was her first venture into France since the retreat from Le Havre in 1563 Henry's succession was strongly contested by the Catholic League and by Philip II, and Elizabeth feared a Spanish takeover of the channel ports.\n\n\nIreland\nAlthough Ireland was one of her two kingdoms, Elizabeth faced a hostile, and in places virtually autonomous, [n] Irish population that adhered to Catholicism and was willing to defy her authority and plot with her enemies Her policy there was to grant land to her courtiers and prevent the rebels from giving Spain a base from which to attack England [153] In the course of a series of uprisings, Crown forces pursued scorched-earth tactics, burning the land and slaughtering man, woman and child During a revolt in Munster led by Gerald FitzGerald, in 1582, an estimated 30,000 Irish people starved to death The poet and colonist Edmund Spenser wrote that the victims \"were brought to such wretchedness as that any stony heart would have rued the same\" [154] Elizabeth advised her commanders that the Irish, \"that rude and barbarous nation\", be well treated, but she or her commanders showed no remorse when force and bloodshed served their authoritarian purpose [155]\n\n\nRussia\nElizabeth continued to maintain the diplomatic relations with the Tsardom of Russia that were originally established by her half-brother, Edward VI She often wrote to Tsar Ivan the Terrible on amicable terms, though the Tsar was often annoyed by her focus on commerce rather than on the possibility of a military alliance Ivan even proposed to her once, and during his later reign, asked for a guarantee to be granted asylum in England should his rule be jeopardised [158] When this failed, he asked to marry Mary Hastings, which Elizabeth declined to speak to the Russian ambassador about [159] English merchant and explorer Anthony Jenkinson, who began his career as a representative of the Muscovy Company, became the queen's special ambassador to the court of Tsar Ivan [160]\n\n\nMuslim states\nTrade and diplomatic relations developed between England and the Barbary states during the rule of Elizabeth [161] [162] England established a trading relationship with Morocco in opposition to Spain, selling armour, ammunition, timber, and metal in exchange for Moroccan sugar, in spite of a papal ban [163] In 1600, Abd el-Ouahed ben Messaoud, the principal secretary to the Moroccan ruler Mulai Ahmad al-Mansur, visited England as an ambassador to the English court, [161] [164] to negotiate an Anglo-Moroccan alliance against Spain [165] [161] Elizabeth \"agreed to sell munitions supplies to Morocco, and she and Mulai Ahmad al-Mansur talked on and off about mounting a joint operation against the Spanish\" [166] Discussions, however, remained inconclusive, and both rulers died within two years of the embassy [167]\n\n\nAmerica\nIn 1583, Humphrey Gilbert sailed west to establish a colony in Newfoundland He never returned to England Gilbert's half-brother Walter Raleigh explored the Atlantic Coast and claimed the territory of Virginia, perhaps named in honour of Elizabeth, the \"Virgin Queen\" This territory was much larger than the present-day state of Virginia, extending from New England to the Carolinas In 1585, Raleigh returned to Virginia with a small group of people They landed on Roanoke Island, off present-day North Carolina After the failure of the first colony, Raleigh recruited another group and put John White in command When Raleigh returned in 1590, there was no trace of the Roanoke Colony he had left, but it was the first English settlement in North America [171]\n\n\nEast India Company\nThe East India Company was formed to trade in the Indian Ocean region and China, and received its charter from Queen Elizabeth on 31 December 1600 For a period of 15 years, the company was awarded a monopoly on English trade with all countries east of the Cape of Good Hope and west of the Straits of Magellan James Lancaster commanded the first expedition in 1601 The Company eventually controlled half of world trade and substantial territory in India in the 18th and 19th centuries [172]\n\n\nLater years\nThe period after the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 brought new difficulties for Elizabeth that lasted until the end of her reign [141] The conflicts with Spain and in Ireland dragged on, the tax burden grew heavier, and the economy was hit by poor harvests and the cost of war Prices rose and the standard of living fell [173] [174] [141] During this time, repression of Catholics intensified, and Elizabeth authorised commissions in 1591 to interrogate and monitor Catholic householders [175] To maintain the illusion of peace and prosperity, she increasingly relied on internal spies and propaganda [173] In her last years, mounting criticism reflected a decline in the public's affection for her [p] [q]\n\n\nDeath\nElizabeth's senior adviser, Lord Burghley, died on 4 August 1598 His political mantle passed to his son Robert, who soon became the leader of the government [t] One task he addressed was to prepare the way for a smooth succession Since Elizabeth would never name her successor, Robert Cecil was obliged to proceed in secret [u] He therefore entered into a coded negotiation with James VI of Scotland, who had a strong but unrecognised claim [v] Cecil coached the impatient James to humour Elizabeth and \"secure the heart of the highest, to whose sex and quality nothing is so improper as either needless expostulations or over much curiosity in her own actions\" [203] The advice worked James's tone delighted Elizabeth, who responded: \"So trust I that you will not doubt but that your last letters are so acceptably taken as my thanks cannot be lacking for the same, but yield them to you in grateful sort\" [204] In historian J E Neale's view, Elizabeth may not have declared her wishes openly to James, but she made them known with \"unmistakable if veiled phrases\" [205]\n\n\nLegacy\nElizabeth was lamented by many of her subjects, but others were relieved at her death [213] Expectations of King James started high but then declined By the 1620s, there was a nostalgic revival of the cult of Elizabeth [214] Elizabeth was praised as a heroine of the Protestant cause and the ruler of a golden age James was depicted as a Catholic sympathiser, presiding over a corrupt court [215] The triumphalist image that Elizabeth had cultivated towards the end of her reign, against a background of factionalism and military and economic difficulties, [216] was taken at face value and her reputation inflated Godfrey Goodman, Bishop of Gloucester, recalled: \"When we had experience of a Scottish government, the Queen did seem to revive Then was her memory much magnified.\" [217] Elizabeth's reign became idealised as a time when crown, church and parliament had worked in constitutional balance [218]\n\n\nFamily tree\n\n\nSee

Parr, rather than confront her husband over his inappropriate activities, joined in, twice accompanying him in tickling Elizabeth, and once holding her while he cut her black gown \"into a thousand pieces.\" However, after Parr discovered the pair in an embrace, she ended this state of affairs.\n\n**Reign of Mary I**\n\nWhen Edward VI died on 6 July 1553, aged 15, his will ignored the Succession to the Crown Act 1543, excluded both Mary and Elizabeth from the succession, and instead declared as his heir Lady Jane Grey, granddaughter of Henry VIII's younger sister Mary Tudor, Queen of France. Jane was proclaimed queen by the privy council, but her support quickly crumbled, and she was deposed after nine days. On 3 August 1553, Mary rode triumphantly into London, with Elizabeth at her side.\n\n## Mary's Reign\n\nThe show of solidarity between the sisters did not last long. Mary, a devout Catholic, was determined to crush the Protestant faith in which Elizabeth had been educated, and she ordered that everyone attend Catholic Mass. Elizabeth had to outwardly conform. Mary's initial popularity ebbed away in 1554 when she announced plans to marry Philip of Spain, the son of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and an active Catholic. Discontent spread rapidly through the country, and many looked to Elizabeth as a focus for their opposition to Mary's religious policies.\n\n**Accession**\n\nElizabeth became queen at the age of 25, and declared her intentions to her council and other peers who had come to Hatfield to swear allegiance. She told them that she was not bound to marry, and that she would not be swayed by the opinions of others. Her speech contains the first record of her adoption of the medieval political theology of the sovereign's \"two bodies\": the body natural and the body politic.\n\n## Church Settlement\n\nElizabeth's personal religious convictions have been much debated by scholars. She was a Protestant, but kept Catholic symbols, such as the crucifix, and downplayed the role of sermons in defiance of a key Protestant belief. She sought to find a middle ground between the two faiths, and her church settlement was a compromise between the two.\n\n## Marriage Question\n\nFrom the start of Elizabeth's reign, it was expected that she would marry, and the question arose to whom. Although she received many offers, she never married and remained childless. The reasons for this are not clear, but historians have speculated that Thomas Seymour had put her off sexual relationships. She considered several suitors until she was about 50 years old, including Francis, Duke of Anjou, 22 years her junior.\n\n## Robert Dudley\n\nIn the spring of 1559, it became evident that Elizabeth was in love with her childhood friend Robert Dudley. He was married to Amy, who suffered from a \"malady in one of her breasts.\" Elizabeth would have liked to marry Robert if his wife should die. By the autumn of 1559, several foreign suitors were vying for Elizabeth's hand, but Robert was her favorite. After Amy's death in September 1560, Elizabeth seriously considered marrying Dudley, but William Cecil, Nicholas Throckmorton, and some conservative peers made their disapproval unmistakably clear.\n\n**Mary, Queen of Scots**\n\nElizabeth's first policy toward Scotland was to oppose the French presence there. She feared that the French planned to invade England and put her Catholic cousin Mary, Queen of Scots, on the throne. Mary was considered by many to be the heir to the English crown, being the granddaughter of Henry VIII's elder sister, Margaret. Elizabeth was persuaded to send a force into Scotland to aid the Protestant rebels, and though the campaign was inept, the resulting Treaty of Edinburgh of July 1560 removed the French threat in the north.\n\n## Catholic Cause\n\nMary was soon the focus for rebellion. In 1569, there was a major Catholic rising in the North, the goal of which was to free Mary, marry her to Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, and put her on the English throne. After the rebels' defeat, over 750 of them were executed on Elizabeth's orders.\n\n## Papal Excommunication\n\nIn 1570, Pope Pius V issued a bull, Regnans in Excelsis, which declared \"Elizabeth, the pretended Queen of England and the servant of crime\" to be excommunicated and a heretic, releasing all her subjects from any allegiance to her. Catholics who obeyed her orders were threatened with excommunication.\n\n## Legislative Initiatives\n\nThe papal bull provoked legislative initiatives against Catholics by Parliament, which were, however, mitigated by Elizabeth's intervention. In 1581, to convert English subjects to Catholicism with \"the intent\" to withdraw them from their allegiance to Elizabeth was made a treasonable offence, carrying the death penalty.\n\n## Missionary Priests\n\nFrom the 1570s, missionary priests from continental seminaries went to England secretly in the cause of the \"reconversion of England.\" Some were executed for treasonable conduct, engendering a cult of martyrdom.\n\n**Wars and Overseas Trade**\n\nElizabeth's foreign policy was largely defensive, but she did pursue an aggressive policy at sea. She knighted Francis Drake after his circumnavigation of the globe from 1577 to 1580, and he won fame for his raids on Spanish ports and fleets.\n\n## Netherlands\n\nAfter the occupation and loss of Le Havre in 1562-1563, Elizabeth avoided military expeditions on the continent until 1585, when she sent an English army to aid the Protestant Dutch rebels against Philip II. This followed the deaths in 1584 of the queen's allies William the Silent, Prince of Orange, and the Duke of Anjou, and the surrender of a series of Dutch towns to Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, Philip's governor of the Spanish Netherlands.\n\n## Spanish Armada\n\nMeanwhile, Francis Drake had undertaken a major voyage against Spanish ports and ships in the Caribbean in 1585 and 1586. In 1587, he made a successful raid on Cádiz, destroying the Spanish fleet of war ships intended for the Enterprise of England, as Philip II had decided to take the war to England.\n\n## France\n\nWhen the Protestant Henry IV inherited the French throne in 1589, Elizabeth sent him military support. It was her first venture into France since the retreat from Le Havre in 1563. Henry's succession was strongly contested by the Catholic League and by Philip II, and Elizabeth feared a Spanish takeover of the channel ports.\n\n## Ireland\n\nAlthough Ireland was one of her two kingdoms, Elizabeth faced a hostile, and in places virtually autonomous, Irish population that adhered to Catholicism and was willing to defy her authority and plot with her enemies. Her policy there was to grant land to her courtiers and prevent the rebels from giving Spain a base from which to attack England.\n\n## Scorched Earth Tactics\n\nIn the course of a series of uprisings, Crown forces pursued scorched-earth tactics, burning the land and slaughtering man, woman and child. During a revolt in Munster led by Gerald FitzGerald, in 1582, an estimated 30,000 Irish people starved to death.\n\n## Edmund Spenser\n\nEdmund Spenser, a poet and colonist, wrote that the victims \"were brought to such wretchedness as that any stony heart would have rued the same.\" Elizabeth advised her commanders that the Irish, \"that rude and barbarous nation\", be well treated, but she or her commanders showed no remorse when force and bloodshed served their authoritarian purpose.\n\n**Russia**\n\nElizabeth continued to maintain the diplomatic relations with the Tsardom of Russia that were originally established by her half-brother, Edward VI. She often wrote to Tsar Ivan the Terrible on amicable terms, though the Tsar was often annoyed by her focus on commerce rather than on the possibility of a military alliance.\n\n## Ivan's Proposal\n\nIvan even proposed to her once, and during his later reign, asked for a guarantee to be granted asylum in England should his rule be jeopardised. When this failed, he asked to marry Mary Hastings, which Elizabeth declined to speak to the Russian ambassador about.\n\n## Anthony Jenkinson\n\nEnglish merchant and explorer Anthony Jenkinson, who began his career as a representative of the Muscovy Company, became the queen's special ambassador to the court of Tsar Ivan.\n\n**Muslim States**\n\nTrade and diplomatic relations developed between England and the Barbary states during the rule of Elizabeth. England established a trading relationship with Morocco in opposition to Spain, selling armour, ammunition, timber, and metal in exchange for Moroccan sugar, in spite of a papal ban.\n\n## Abd el-Ouahed ben Messaoud\n\nIn 1600, Abd el-Ouahed ben Messaoud, the principal secretary to the Moroccan ruler Mulai Ahmad al-Mansur, visited England as an ambassador to the English court, to negotiate an Anglo-Moroccan alliance against Spain.\n\n**America**\n\nIn 1583, Humphrey Gilbert sailed west to establish a colony in Newfoundland. He never returned to England. Gilbert's half-brother Walter Raleigh explored the Atlantic Coast and claimed the territory of Virginia, perhaps named in honour of Elizabeth, the \"Virgin Queen.\" This territory was much larger than the present-day state of Virginia, extending from New England to the Carolinas.\n\n## Roanoke Colony\n\nIn 1585, Raleigh returned to Virginia with a small group of people. They landed on Roanoke Island, off present-day North Carolina. After the failure of the first colony, Raleigh recruited another group and put John White in command. When Raleigh returned in 1590, there was no trace of the Roanoke Colony he had left, but it was the first English settlement in North America.\n\n**East India Company**\n\nThe East India Company was formed to trade in the Indian Ocean region and China, and received its charter from Queen Elizabeth on 31 December 1600. For a period of 15 years, the company was awarded a monopoly on English trade with all countries east of the Cape of Good Hope and west of the Straits of Magellan.\n\n## James Lancaster\n\nJames Lancaster commanded the first expedition in 1601. The Company eventually controlled half of world trade and substantial territory in India in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\n**Later Years**\n\nThe period after the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 brought new difficulties for Elizabeth that lasted until the end of her reign. The conflicts with Spain and in Ireland dragged on, the tax burden grew heavier, and the economy was hit by poor harvests and the cost of war. Prices rose and the standard of living fell.\n\n## Repression of Catholics\n\nDuring this time, repression of Catholics intensified, and Elizabeth authorised commissions in 1591 to interrogate and monitor Catholic householders. To maintain the illusion of peace and prosperity, she increasingly relied on internal spies and propaganda.\n\n## Decline in Affection\n\nIn her last years, mounting criticism reflected a decline in the public's affection for her.\n\n**Death**\n\nElizabeth's senior adviser, Lord Burghley, died on 4 August 1598. His political mantle passed to his son Robert, who soon became the leader of the government. One task he addressed was to prepare the way for a smooth succession. Since Elizabeth would never name her successor, Robert Cecil was obliged to proceed in secret.\n\n## Coded Negotiation\n\nHe therefore entered into a coded negotiation with James VI of Scotland, who had a strong but unrecognised claim. Cecil coached the impatient James to humour Elizabeth and \"secure the heart of the highest, to whose sex and quality nothing is so improper as either needless expostulations or over much curiosity in her own actions.\"\n\n## James's Response\n\nThe advice worked James's tone delighted Elizabeth, who responded: \"So trust I that you will not doubt but that your last letters are so acceptably taken as my thanks cannot be lacking for the same, but yield them to you in grateful sort.\"\n\n## Legacy\n\nElizabeth was lamented by many of her subjects, but others were relieved at her death. Expectations of King James started high but then declined. By the 1620s, there was a nostalgic revival of the cult of Elizabeth. Elizabeth was praised as a heroine of the Protestant cause and the ruler of a golden age. James was depicted as a Catholic sympathiser, presiding over a corrupt court.\n\n## Triumphalist Image\n\nThe triumphalist image that Elizabeth had cultivated towards the end of her reign, against a background of factionalism and military and economic difficulties, was taken at face value and her reputation inflated. Godfrey Goodman, Bishop of Gloucester, recalled: \"When we had experience of a Scottish government, the Queen did seem to revive. Then was her memory much magnified.\"\n\n## Idealised Reign\n\nElizabeth's reign became idealised as a time when crown, church and parliament had worked in constitutional balance.\n\n**Family Tree**\n\nElizabeth I was born on 7 September 1533 to Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. Her father was the King of England, and her mother was his second wife. Elizabeth had two half-siblings, Edward and Mary, who were also children of Henry VIII.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Elizabeth I's Speech to the Troops at Tilbury\n* Elizabeth I's Accession to the Throne\n* Elizabeth I's Marriage to Robert Dudley\n* Elizabeth I's Death and Succession\n* Elizabeth I's Legacy\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Elizabeth I was the last of the five monarchs of the House of Tudor.\n* She was the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.\n* Elizabeth I was a Protestant and a strong supporter of the Church of England.\n* She never married and had no children.\n* Elizabeth I was a skilled politician and a strong leader who maintained the stability of the kingdom during a time of great turmoil.\n\n**Citations**\n\n* This article is based on the Wikipedia article \"Elizabeth I\".\n* The article is written in a neutral and encyclopedic tone.\n* The article includes a brief overview of Elizabeth's life and reign, as well as a detailed examination of her policies and legacy.\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Elizabeth I\".

on 7 September 1533 and was named after her grandmothers, Elizabeth of York and Lady Elizabeth Howard [6] She was the second child of Henry VIII of England born in wedlock to survive infancy Her mother was Henry VIII's second wife, Anne Boleyn At birth, Elizabeth was the heir presumptive to the English throne Her elder half-sister Mary had lost her position as a legitimate heir when Henry annulled his marriage to Mary's mother, Catherine of Aragon, to marry Anne, with the intent to sire a male heir and ensure the Tudor succession [7] [8] She was baptised on 10 September 1533, and her godparents were Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury; Henry Courtenay, Marquess of Exeter; Elizabeth Stafford, Duchess of Norfolk; and Margaret Wotton, Dowager Marchioness of Dorset A canopy was carried at the ceremony over the infant by her uncle George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford; John Hussey, Baron Hussey of Sleaford; Lord Thomas Howard; and William Howard, Baron Howard of Effingham [9]\n\n\nThomas Seymour\nHenry VIII died in 1547 and Elizabeth's half-brother, Edward VI, became king at the age of nine Catherine Parr, Henry's widow, soon married Thomas Seymour, Baron Seymour of Sudeley, Edward VI's uncle and the brother of Lord Protector Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset The couple took Elizabeth into their household at Chelsea There Elizabeth experienced an emotional crisis that some historians believe affected her for the rest of her life [23] Thomas Seymour engaged in romps and horseplay with the 14-year-old Elizabeth, including entering her bedroom in his nightgown, tickling her, and slapping her on the buttocks Elizabeth rose early and surrounded herself with maids to avoid his unwelcome morning visits Parr, rather than confront her husband over his inappropriate activities, joined in Twice she accompanied him in tickling Elizabeth, and once held her while he cut her black gown \"into a thousand pieces\" [24] However, after Parr discovered the pair in an embrace, she ended this state of affairs [25] In May 1548, Elizabeth was sent away.\n\n\nReign of Mary I\nEdward VI died on 6 July 1553, aged 15 His will ignored the Succession to the Crown Act 1543, excluded both Mary and Elizabeth from the succession, and instead declared as his heir Lady Jane Grey, granddaughter of Henry VIII's younger sister Mary Tudor, Queen of France Jane was proclaimed queen by the privy council, but her support quickly crumbled, and she was deposed after nine days On 3 August 1553, Mary rode triumphantly into London, with Elizabeth at her side [d]\nThe show of solidarity between the sisters did not last long Mary, a devout Catholic, was determined to crush the Protestant faith in which Elizabeth had been educated, and she ordered that everyone attend Catholic Mass; Elizabeth had to outwardly conform Mary's initial popularity ebbed away in 1554 when she announced plans to marry Philip of Spain, the son of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and an active Catholic [33] Discontent spread rapidly through the country, and many looked to Elizabeth as a focus for their opposition to Mary's religious policies.\n\n\nAccession\nElizabeth became queen at the age of 25, and declared her intentions to her council and other peers who had come to Hatfield to swear allegiance The speech contains the first record of her adoption of the medieval political theology of the sovereign's \"two bodies\": the body natural and the body politic: [45]\n\n\nChurch settlement\nElizabeth's personal religious convictions have been much debated by scholars She was a Protestant, but kept Catholic symbols (such as the crucifix), and downplayed the role of sermons in defiance of a key Protestant belief [53]\n\n\nMarriage question\nFrom the start of Elizabeth's reign it was expected that she would marry, and the question arose to whom Although she received many offers, she never married and remained childless; the reasons for this are not clear Historians have speculated that Thomas Seymour had put her off sexual relationships [59] [60] She considered several suitors until she was about 50 years old Her last courtship was with Francis, Duke of Anjou, 22 years her junior While risking possible loss of power like her sister, who played into the hands of King Philip II of Spain, marriage offered the chance of an heir [61] However, the choice of a husband might also provoke political instability or even insurrection [62]\n\n\nRobert Dudley\nIn the spring of 1559, it became evident that Elizabeth was in love with her childhood friend Robert Dudley [63] It was said that his wife Amy was suffering from a \"malady in one of her breasts\" and that the queen would like to marry Robert if his wife should die [64] By the autumn of 1559, several foreign suitors were vying for Elizabeth's hand; their impatient envoys engaged in ever more scandalous talk and reported that a marriage with her favourite was not welcome in England: [65] \"There is not a man who does not cry out on him and her with indignation .. she will marry none but the favoured Robert.\" [66] Amy Dudley died in September 1560, from a fall from a flight of stairs and, despite the coroner's inquest finding of accident, many people suspected her husband of having arranged her death so that he could marry the queen [67] [h] Elizabeth seriously considered marrying Dudley for some time However, William Cecil, Nicholas Throckmorton, and some conservative peers made their disapproval unmistakably clear [70] There were even rumours that the nobility would rise if the marriage took place [71]\n\n\nForeign candidates\nMarriage negotiations constituted a key element in Elizabeth's foreign policy [77] She turned down the hand of Philip, her half-sister's widower, early in 1559 but for several years entertained the proposal of King Eric XIV of Sweden [78] [79] [80] Earlier in Elizabeth's life, a Danish match for her had been discussed; Henry VIII had proposed one with the Danish prince Adolf, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, in 1545, and Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, suggested a marriage with Prince Frederick (later Frederick II) several years later, but the negotiations had abated in 1551 [81] In the years around 1559, a Dano-English Protestant alliance was considered, [82] and to counter Sweden's proposal, King Frederick II proposed to Elizabeth in late 1559 [81]\n\n\nVirginity\nElizabeth's unmarried status inspired a cult of virginity related to that of the Virgin Mary In poetry and portraiture, she was depicted as a virgin, a goddess, or both, not as a normal woman [91] At first, only Elizabeth made a virtue of her ostensible virginity: in 1559, she told the Commons, \"And, in the end, this shall be for me sufficient, that a marble stone shall declare that a queen, having reigned such a time, lived and died a virgin\" [92] Later on, poets and writers took up the theme and developed an iconography that exalted Elizabeth Public tributes to the Virgin by 1578 acted as a coded assertion of opposition to the queen's marriage negotiations with the Duke of Alençon [93] Ultimately, Elizabeth would insist she was married to her kingdom and subjects, under divine protection In 1599, she spoke of \"all my husbands, my good people\" [94]\n\n\nMary, Queen of Scots\nElizabeth's first policy toward Scotland was to oppose the French presence there [104] She feared that the French planned to invade England and put her Catholic cousin Mary, Queen of Scots, on the throne Mary was considered by many to be the heir to the English crown, being the granddaughter of Henry VIII's elder sister, Margaret Mary boasted being \"the nearest kinswoman she hath\" [105] [i] Elizabeth was persuaded to send a force into Scotland to aid the Protestant rebels, and though the campaign was inept, the resulting Treaty of Edinburgh of July 1560 removed the French threat in the north [j] When Mary returned from France to Scotland in 1561 to take up the reins of power, the country had an established Protestant church and was run by a council of Protestant nobles supported by Elizabeth [107] Mary refused to ratify the treaty [108]\n\n\nCatholic cause\nMary was soon the focus for rebellion In 1569 there was a major Catholic rising in the North; the goal was to free Mary, marry her to Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, and put her on the English throne [112] After the rebels' defeat, over 750 of them were executed on Elizabeth's orders [113] In the belief that the revolt had been successful, Pope Pius V issued a bull in 1570, titled Regnans in Excelsis, which declared \"Elizabeth, the pretended Queen of England and the servant of crime\" to be excommunicated and a heretic, releasing all her subjects from any allegiance to her [114] [115] Catholics who obeyed her orders were threatened with excommunication [114] The papal bull provoked legislative initiatives against Catholics by Parliament, which were, however, mitigated by Elizabeth's intervention [116] In 1581, to convert English subjects to Catholicism with \"the intent\" to withdraw them from their allegiance to Elizabeth was made a treasonable offence, carrying the death penalty [117] From the 1570s missionary priests from continental seminaries went to England secretly in the cause of the \"reconversion of England\" [115] Some were executed for treasonable conduct, engendering a cult of martyrdom [115]\n\n\nWars and overseas trade\nElizabeth's foreign policy was largely defensive The exception was the English occupation of Le Havre from October 1562 to June 1563, which ended in failure when Elizabeth's Huguenot allies joined with the Catholics to retake the port Elizabeth's intention had been to exchange Le Havre for Calais, lost to France in January 1558 [121] Only through the activities of her fleets did Elizabeth pursue an aggressive policy This paid off in the war against Spain, 80% of which was fought at sea [122] She knighted Francis Drake after his circumnavigation of the globe from 1577 to 1580, and he won fame for his raids on Spanish ports and fleets An element of piracy and self-enrichment drove Elizabethan seafarers, over whom the queen had little control [123] [124]\n\n\nNetherlands\nAfter the occupation and loss of Le Havre in 1562–1563, Elizabeth avoided military expeditions on the continent until 1585, when she sent an English army to aid the Protestant Dutch rebels against Philip II [125] This followed the deaths in 1584 of the queen's allies William the Silent, Prince of Orange, and the Duke of Anjou, and the surrender of a series of Dutch towns to Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, Philip's governor of the Spanish Netherlands In December 1584, an alliance between Philip II and the French Catholic League at Joinville undermined the ability of Anjou's brother, Henry III of France, to counter Spanish domination of the Netherlands It also extended Spanish influence along the channel coast of France, where the Catholic League was strong, and exposed England to invasion [125] The siege of Antwerp in the summer of 1585 by the Duke of Parma necessitated some reaction on the part of the English and the Dutch The outcome was the Treaty of Nonsuch of August 1585, in which Elizabeth promised military support to the Dutch [126] The treaty marked the beginning of the Anglo-Spanish War, which lasted until the Treaty of London in 1604.\n\n\nSpanish Armada\nMeanwhile, Francis Drake had undertaken a major voyage against Spanish ports and ships in the Caribbean in 1585 and 1586 In 1587 he made a successful raid on Cádiz, destroying the Spanish fleet of war ships intended for the Enterprise of England, [135] as Philip II had decided to take the war to England [136]\n\n\nFrance\nWhen the Protestant Henry IV inherited the French throne in 1589, Elizabeth sent him military support It was her first venture into France since the retreat from Le Havre in 1563 Henry's succession was strongly contested by the Catholic League and by Philip II, and Elizabeth feared a Spanish takeover of the channel ports.\n\n\nIreland\nAlthough Ireland was one of her two kingdoms, Elizabeth faced a hostile, and in places virtually autonomous, [n] Irish population that adhered to Catholicism and was willing to defy her authority and plot with her enemies Her policy there was to grant land to her courtiers and prevent the rebels from giving Spain a base from which to attack England [153] In the course of a series of uprisings, Crown forces pursued scorched-earth tactics, burning the land and slaughtering man, woman and child During a revolt in Munster led by Gerald FitzGerald, in 1582, an estimated 30,000 Irish people starved to death The poet and colonist Edmund Spenser wrote that the victims \"were brought to such wretchedness as that any stony heart would have rued the same\" [154] Elizabeth advised her commanders that the Irish, \"that rude and barbarous nation\", be well treated, but she or her commanders showed no remorse when force and bloodshed served their authoritarian purpose [155]\n\n\nRussia\nElizabeth continued to maintain the diplomatic relations with the Tsardom of Russia that were originally established by her half-brother, Edward VI She often wrote to Tsar Ivan the Terrible on amicable terms, though the Tsar was often annoyed by her focus on commerce rather than on the possibility of a military alliance Ivan even proposed to her once, and during his later reign, asked for a guarantee to be granted asylum in England should his rule be jeopardised [158] When this failed, he asked to marry Mary Hastings, which Elizabeth declined to speak to the Russian ambassador about [159] English merchant and explorer Anthony Jenkinson, who began his career as a representative of the Muscovy Company, became the queen's special ambassador to the court of Tsar Ivan [160]\n\n\nMuslim states\nTrade and diplomatic relations developed between England and the Barbary states during the rule of Elizabeth [161] [162] England established a trading relationship with Morocco in opposition to Spain, selling armour, ammunition, timber, and metal in exchange for Moroccan sugar, in spite of a papal ban [163] In 1600, Abd el-Ouahed ben Messaoud, the principal secretary to the Moroccan ruler Mulai Ahmad al-Mansur, visited England as an ambassador to the English court, [161] [164] to negotiate an Anglo-Moroccan alliance against Spain [165] [161] Elizabeth \"agreed to sell munitions supplies to Morocco, and she and Mulai Ahmad al-Mansur talked on and off about mounting a joint operation against the Spanish\" [166] Discussions, however, remained inconclusive, and both rulers died within two years of the embassy [167]\n\n\nAmerica\nIn 1583, Humphrey Gilbert sailed west to establish a colony in Newfoundland He never returned to England Gilbert's half-brother Walter Raleigh explored the Atlantic Coast and claimed the territory of Virginia, perhaps named in honour of Elizabeth, the \"Virgin Queen\" This territory was much larger than the present-day state of Virginia, extending from New England to the Carolinas In 1585, Raleigh returned to Virginia with a small group of people They landed on Roanoke Island, off present-day North Carolina After the failure of the first colony, Raleigh recruited another group and put John White in command When Raleigh returned in 1590, there was no trace of the Roanoke Colony he had left, but it was the first English settlement in North America [171]\n\n\nEast India Company\nThe East India Company was formed to trade in the Indian Ocean region and China, and received its charter from Queen Elizabeth on 31 December 1600 For a period of 15 years, the company was awarded a monopoly on English trade with all countries east of the Cape of Good Hope and west of the Straits of Magellan James Lancaster commanded the first expedition in 1601 The Company eventually controlled half of world trade and substantial territory in India in the 18th and 19th centuries [172]\n\n\nLater years\nThe period after the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 brought new difficulties for Elizabeth that lasted until the end of her reign [141] The conflicts with Spain and in Ireland dragged on, the tax burden grew heavier, and the economy was hit by poor harvests and the cost of war Prices rose and the standard of living fell [173] [174] [141] During this time, repression of Catholics intensified, and Elizabeth authorised commissions in 1591 to interrogate and monitor Catholic householders [175] To maintain the illusion of peace and prosperity, she increasingly relied on internal spies and propaganda [173] In her last years, mounting criticism reflected a decline in the public's affection for her [p] [q]\n\n\nDeath\nElizabeth's senior adviser, Lord Burghley, died on 4 August 1598 His political mantle passed to his son Robert, who soon became the leader of the government [t] One task he addressed was to prepare the way for a smooth succession Since Elizabeth would never name her successor, Robert Cecil was obliged to proceed in secret [u] He therefore entered into a coded negotiation with James VI of Scotland, who had a strong but unrecognised claim [v] Cecil coached the impatient James to humour Elizabeth and \"secure the heart of the highest, to whose sex and quality nothing is so improper as either needless expostulations or over much curiosity in her own actions\" [203] The advice worked James's tone delighted Elizabeth, who responded: \"So trust I that you will not doubt but that your last letters are so acceptably taken as my thanks cannot be lacking for the same, but yield them to you in grateful sort\" [204] In historian J E Neale's view, Elizabeth may not have declared her wishes openly to James, but she made them known with \"unmistakable if veiled phrases\" [205]\n\n\nLegacy\nElizabeth was lamented by many of her subjects, but others were relieved at her death [213] Expectations of King James started high but then declined By the 1620s, there was a nostalgic revival of the cult of Elizabeth [214] Elizabeth was praised as a heroine of the Protestant cause and the ruler of a golden age James was depicted as a Catholic sympathiser, presiding over a corrupt court [215] The triumphalist image that Elizabeth had cultivated towards the

The dynasty was founded by Ernest Augustus, Elector of Hanover, and his wife, Sophia of the Palatinate, in 1635. They were the parents of George I of Great Britain, who became the first British monarch of the House of Hanover in 1714.\n\n**History**\n\nThe House of Hanover was founded when Ernest Augustus, Elector of Hanover, inherited the Principality of Calenberg from his father, George, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg. Ernest Augustus moved his residence to Hanover and established the House of Hanover as a separate branch of the House of Brunswick-Lüneburg. His son, George Louis, inherited the Principality of Calenberg and later became George I of Great Britain.\n\nThe Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg was divided in 1635, and George Louis inherited the Principality of Calenberg, while his brother, Christian Louis, inherited the Principality of Lüneburg. The two brothers shared the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg until it was united under George Louis's grandson, also called George, in 1705.\n\nThe House of Hanover played a significant role in the history of Europe during the 17th to 20th centuries. They ruled several states, including the Duchy of Hanover, the Electorate of Hanover, the Kingdom of Great Britain, and the Kingdom of Hanover.\n\n**Dukes and Electors of Brunswick-Lüneburg**\n\nThe Dukes and Electors of Brunswick-Lüneburg were the rulers of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg, which was a state in the Holy Roman Empire. The Dukes and Electors of Brunswick-Lüneburg were members of the House of Hanover and held the title of Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg.\n\nGeorge, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, was the first member of the House of Hanover. He inherited the Principality of Calenberg from his father, George, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, and moved his residence to Hanover. His son, Christian Louis, inherited the Principality of Lüneburg from his uncle, Calenberg, and shared the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg with his brother, George Louis.\n\nThe Dukes and Electors of Brunswick-Lüneburg had significant influence in the Holy Roman Empire and played a crucial role in the history of Europe during the 17th to 20th centuries.\n\n**Monarchs of Great Britain, Ireland, and Hanover**\n\nThe House of Hanover provided six British monarchs, including George I, George II, George III, George IV, William IV, and Victoria. They ruled the Kingdom of Great Britain, the Kingdom of Ireland, and the Kingdom of Hanover from 1714 to 1901.\n\nGeorge I was the first British monarch of the House of Hanover. He became king in 1714 and ruled until his death in 1727. His son, George II, succeeded him and ruled until his death in 1760. George III, George IV, William IV, and Victoria followed, each ruling for several decades.\n\nThe monarchs of the House of Hanover played a significant role in the history of the United Kingdom and the world. They influenced politics, culture, and society, and left a lasting legacy that continues to shape the modern world.\n\n**Prince-Bishops of Osnabrück**\n\nThe Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück was a state in the Holy Roman Empire that was awarded alternately to a Catholic bishop and a member of the House of Hanover. The treaty of the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 gave cadets priority over heirs and reigning princes, making Osnabrück a form of appanage of the House of Hanover.\n\nThe Prince-Bishops of Osnabrück were members of the House of Hanover and held the title of Prince-Bishop of Osnabrück. They played a significant role in the history of the Holy Roman Empire and the House of Hanover.\n\n**Dukes of Brunswick**\n\nThe Duchy of Brunswick was a state in Germany that was ruled by the House of Welf. However, in 1884, the senior branch of the House of Welf became extinct, and the House of Hanover became the next in line to inherit the Duchy of Brunswick.\n\nHowever, there was strong Prussian pressure against having George V of Hanover or his son, the Duke of Cumberland, succeed to the Duchy of Brunswick without strong conditions, including the swearing to the German constitution. As a result, a temporary council of regency was established to take over at the Duke's death and, if necessary, to appoint a regent.\n\n**Claimants**\n\nThe later heads of the House of Hanover have been:\n\n* George V of Hanover\n* Ernest Augustus of Hanover\n* Ernest Augustus of Hanover (1892-1918)\n* George William of Hanover\n* George Frederick of Hanover\n* Ernest Augustus of Hanover (1918-1953)\n* Ernest Augustus of Hanover (1953-1987)\n* Ernst August of Hanover\n\n**Members**\n\nMany towns and provinces across the British Empire were named after the ruling House of Hanover and its members. They include the U.S state of Georgia, U.S towns Hanover, Massachusetts; Hanover, New Hampshire; Hanover, Pennsylvania; Hanover Township, Jo Daviess County, Illinois, counties Hanover County, Virginia; Caroline County, Virginia; Brunswick County, Virginia; New Hanover County, North Carolina; Brunswick County, North Carolina; King George County, Virginia, places named Georgia in New Jersey (e.g New Brunswick, NJ), Vermont, Arkansas and South Dakota, seven towns in the U.S and Canada named after Queen Charlotte.\n\nFurthermore, the Canadian province of New Brunswick and towns Hanover, Ontario, Guelph; Ontario, and Victoria, British Columbia; in South Africa the town Hanover, Northern Cape, in Australia the state Victoria and the city Adelaide, in the UK six and in the US thirteen towns named Brunswick, furthermore one each in Australia and New Zealand, and worldwide more than fifty towns named Victoria.\n\nThere are also numerous streets and squares, such as Hanover Square, Westminster, Hanover Square (Manhattan), Hanover Square, Syracuse or Queen Street, Brisbane with its intersections named after members of the House.\n\n**Family Tree**\n\nThe family tree of the House of Hanover is complex and includes many members. Here is a simplified version:\n\n* Ernest Augustus, Elector of Hanover (1629-1698)\n* Sophia of the Palatinate (1630-1714)\n* George I of Great Britain (1660-1727)\n* Sophia Dorothea of Celle (1666-1726)\n* George II of Great Britain (1683-1760)\n* Caroline of Ansbach (1683-1737)\n* Frederick, Prince of Wales (1707-1751)\n* George III of the United Kingdom (1738-1820)\n* Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1744-1818)\n* George IV of the United Kingdom (1762-1830)\n* Caroline of Brunswick (1768-1821)\n* William IV of the United Kingdom (1765-1837)\n* Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen (1792-1849)\n* Victoria of the United Kingdom (1819-1901)\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThe House of Hanover played a significant role in the history of Europe and the world. They influenced politics, culture, and society, and left a lasting legacy that continues to shape the modern world.\n\nTheir legacy can be seen in the many towns and provinces named after them, as well as in the many cultural and artistic achievements of the House of Hanover.

The show is created by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky, who are known for their work on The Office.\n\n**Synopsis**\n\nThe series follows the inner workings of a jury trial in the United States through the eyes of Ronald Gladden, a solar contractor from San Diego, who is unaware that his jury duty summons was not official. As a result, everyone in the courtroom aside from him is an actor, and everything that happens, inside and outside the courtroom, is planned.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe series stars James Marsden as Ronald Gladden, a confused and naive juror who finds himself in the middle of a fabricated trial. The cast also includes a group of up-and-coming actors with improv backgrounds, who play the roles of the actors in the courtroom.\n\n**Jurors**\n\nThe jurors are a diverse group of individuals who are also unaware that they are part of a scripted show. They are all actors, but they are playing their roles as if they are in a real trial. The show doesn't reveal the identities of the jurors, but it does show their interactions with each other and with Ronald.\n\n**Other**\n\nOther characters in the show include the judge, the prosecutor, and the defendant, all of whom are played by actors. The show also features a number of supporting characters, including court clerks, bailiffs, and lawyers. The show's creators have said that they wanted to create a show that felt like a real trial, but with a comedic twist.\n\n**Episodes**\n\nThe series consists of six episodes, each of which takes place over a day in the life of the trial. The episodes are:\n\n* Episode 1: \"The Summons\" - Ronald receives his jury duty summons and is confused about what it means.\n* Episode 2: \"The Courtroom\" - Ronald arrives at the courtroom and meets the other jurors and the actors who are participating in the trial.\n* Episode 3: \"The Trial Begins\" - The trial starts, and Ronald is confused about what is happening.\n* Episode 4: \"The Evidence\" - The prosecution presents its case, and Ronald is confused about the evidence.\n* Episode 5: \"The Defense\" - The defense presents its case, and Ronald is still confused.\n* Episode 6: \"The Verdict\" - The jury delivers its verdict, and the trial comes to a close.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe series was filmed over 17 days in a real courtroom south of Los Angeles. The creators wanted to create a show that felt like a real trial, so they used a real courtroom and real judges and lawyers. However, the show is semi-improvised, which means that the actors are given some freedom to improvise and react to the situation.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe series premiered on Amazon Freevee on April 7, 2023, with the first four episodes. The fifth and sixth episodes were released on April 14, 2023, and the final two episodes, including the season finale, were released on April 21, 2023.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe series has received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the series has an approval rating of 82% based on 33 critic reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10.

{"title": "Franz_Joseph_I_of_Austria", "content": "\nEarly life\nFranz Joseph was born on 18 August 1830 in the Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna (on the 65th anniversary of the death of Francis of Lorraine) as the eldest son of Archduke Franz Karl (the younger son of Francis I), and his wife Sophie, Princess of Bavaria Because his uncle, reigning from 1835 as the Emperor Ferdinand, was disabled by seizures, and his father unambitious and retiring, the mother of the young Archduke \"Franzi\" brought him up as a future emperor, with emphasis on devotion, responsibility and diligence.\n\n\nRevolutions of 1848\nDuring the Revolutions of 1848, the Austrian Chancellor Prince Klemens von Metternich resigned (March–April 1848) The young archduke, who (it was widely expected) would soon succeed his uncle on the throne, was appointed Governor of Bohemia on 6 April 1848, but never took up the post Sent instead to the front in Italy, he joined Field Marshal Radetzky on campaign on 29 April, receiving his baptism of fire on 5 May at Santa Lucia.\n\n\nRevolution in Hungary\nUnlike other Habsburg ruled areas, the Kingdom of Hungary had an old historic constitution, [8] which limited the power of the crown and had greatly increased the authority of the parliament since the 13th century.\nThe Hungarian reform laws (April laws) were based on the 12 points that established the fundaments of modern civil and political rights, economic and societal reforms in the Kingdom of Hungary [9] The crucial turning point of the Hungarian events were the April laws which was ratified by his uncle King Ferdinand, however the new young Austrian monarch Francis Joseph arbitrarily \"revoked\" the laws without any legal competence The monarchs had no right to revoke Hungarian parliamentary laws which were already signed This unconstitutional act irreversibly escalated the conflict between the Hungarian parliament and Francis Joseph The Austrian Stadion Constitution was accepted by the Imperial Diet of Austria, where Hungary had no representation, and which traditionally had no legislative power in the territory of Kingdom of Hungary; despite this, it also tried to abolish the Diet of Hungary (which existed as the supreme legislative power in Hungary since the late 12th century.) [10]\n\n\nConstitutional and legitimacy problems in Hungary\nOn 7 December 1848, the Diet of Hungary formally refused to acknowledge the title of the new king, \"as without the knowledge and consent of the diet no one could sit on the Hungarian throne\", and called the nation to arms [12] While in most Western European countries (like France and the United Kingdom) the monarch's reign began immediately upon the death of their predecessor, in Hungary the coronation was indispensable;  if it were not properly executed, the kingdom remained \"orphaned\".\n\n\nMilitary difficulties in Hungary\nWhile the revolutions in the Austrian territories had been suppressed by 1849, in Hungary, the situation was more severe and Austrian defeat seemed imminent Sensing a need to secure his right to rule, Franz Joseph sought help from Russia, requesting the intervention of Tsar Nicolas I, in order \"to prevent the Hungarian insurrection developing into a European calamity\" [16] For the Russian military support, Franz Joseph kissed the hand of the tsar in Warsaw on 21 May 1849 [17] Tsar Nicholas supported Franz Joseph in the name of the Holy Alliance, [18] and sent a 200,000 strong army with 80,000 auxiliary forces Finally, the joint army of Russian and Austrian forces defeated the Hungarian forces After the restoration of Habsburg power, Hungary was placed under brutal martial law [19]\n\n\nAssassination attempt in 1853\nOn 18 February 1853, Franz Joseph survived an assassination attempt by Hungarian nationalist János Libényi [21] The emperor was taking a stroll with one of his officers, Count Maximilian Karl Lamoral O'Donnell, on a city bastion, when Libényi approached him He immediately struck the emperor from behind with a knife straight at the neck Franz Joseph almost always wore a uniform, which had a high collar that almost completely enclosed the neck The collars of uniforms at that time were made from very sturdy material, precisely to counter this kind of attack Even though the Emperor was wounded and bleeding, the collar saved his life Count O'Donnell struck Libényi down with his sabre [21]\n\n\nConsolidation of domestic policy\nThe next few years saw the seeming recovery of Austria's position on the international scene following the near disasters of 1848–1849 Under Schwarzenberg's guidance, Austria was able to stymie Prussian scheming to create a new German Federation under Prussian leadership, excluding Austria After Schwarzenberg's premature death in 1852, he could not be replaced by statesmen of equal stature, and the emperor himself effectively took over as prime minister [20] He was one of the most prominent Roman Catholic rulers in Europe, and a fierce enemy of Freemasonry [25]\n\n\nAustro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867\nThe 1850s witnessed several failures of Austrian external policy: the Crimean War, the dissolution of its alliance with Russia, and defeat in the Second Italian War of Independence The setbacks continued in the 1860s with defeat in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, which resulted in the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 [26]\n\n\nBohemian question\nFollowing the accession of Franz Joseph to the throne in 1848, the political representatives of the Kingdom of Bohemia hoped and insisted that account should be taken of their historical state rights in the upcoming constitution They felt the position of Bohemia within the Habsburg monarchy should have been highlighted by a coronation of the new ruler to the king of Bohemia in Prague (the last coronation took place in 1836) However, before the 19th century the Habsburgs had ruled Bohemia by hereditary right and a separate coronation was not deemed necessary.\n\n\nForeign policy\nThe main foreign policy goal of Franz Joseph had been the unification of Germany under the House of Habsburg [31] This was justified on grounds of precedence; from 1452 to the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, with only one brief period of interruption under the House of Wittelsbach, the Habsburgs had generally held the German crown [32] However, Franz Joseph's desire to retain the non-German territories of the Habsburg Austrian Empire in the event of German unification proved problematic.\n\n\nGerman question\nThe main foreign policy goal of Franz Joseph had been the unification of Germany under the House of Habsburg [31] This was justified on grounds of precedence; from 1452 to the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, with only one brief period of interruption under the House of Wittelsbach, the Habsburgs had generally held the German crown [32] However, Franz Joseph's desire to retain the non-German territories of the Habsburg Austrian Empire in the event of German unification proved problematic.\n\n\nThree Emperors League\nIn 1873, two years after the unification of Germany, Franz Joseph entered into the League of Three Emperors (Dreikaiserbund) with Emperor Wilhelm I of Germany and Emperor Alexander II of Russia, who was succeeded by Tsar Alexander III in 1881 The league had been designed by the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck, as an attempt to maintain the peace of Europe It would last intermittently until 1887.\n\n\nVatican\nIn 1903, Franz Joseph's veto of Jus exclusivae of Cardinal Mariano Rampolla's election to the papacy was transmitted to the Papal conclave by Cardinal Jan Puzyna de Kosielsko It was the last use of such a veto, as the new Pope Pius X prohibited future uses and provided for excommunication for any attempt [34] [35]\n\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina\nDuring the mid-1870s a series of violent rebellions against Ottoman rule broke out in the Balkans, and the Turks responded with equally violent and oppressive reprisals Tsar Alexander II of Russia, wanting to intervene against the Ottomans, sought and obtained an agreement with Austria-Hungary.\n\n\nOutbreak of World War I\nOn 28 June 1914 Franz Joseph's nephew and heir-presumptive Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and his morganatic wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, were assassinated by Gavrilo Princip, a Yugoslav nationalist of Serbian ethnicity, [39] during a visit to Sarajevo Franz Joseph learned about the assassination of Franz Ferdinand from his adjutant, cavalry General Eduard von Paar, [40] who also wrote the emperor's reaction in his diary: \"one has not to defy the Almighty In this manner a superior power has restored that order which I unfortunately was unable to maintain.\" [40]\n\n\nDeath\nFranz Joseph died in the Schönbrunn Palace on the evening of 21 November 1916, at the age of 86 His death was a result of developing pneumonia of the right lung several days after catching a cold while walking in Schönbrunn Park with King Ludwig III of Bavaria [42] He was succeeded by his grand-nephew Charles I & IV, who reigned until the collapse of the empire following its defeat at the end of the First World War in 1918 [43]\n\n\nFamily\nIt was generally felt in the court that the emperor should marry and produce heirs as soon as possible Various potential brides were considered, including Princess Elisabeth of Modena, Princess Anna of Prussia and Princess Sidonia of Saxony [44] Although in public life Franz Joseph was the unquestioned director of affairs, in his private life his mother still wielded crucial influence Sophie wanted to strengthen the relationship between the Houses of Habsburg and Wittelsbach—descending from the latter house herself—and hoped to match Franz Joseph with her sister Ludovika's eldest daughter, Helene (\"Néné\"), who was four years the emperor's junior.\n\n\nRelationship with Franz Ferdinand\nArchduke Franz Ferdinand became heir presumptive (Thronfolger) to the throne of Austria-Hungary in 1896, after the deaths of his cousin Rudolf (in 1889) and his father Karl Ludwig (in 1896) The relationship between him and Franz Joseph had always been a fairly contentious one, which was further exacerbated when Franz Ferdinand announced his desire to marry Countess Sophie Chotek The emperor would not even consider giving his blessing to the union, as Sophie was merely of noble rank, not dynastic rank.\n\n\nTitles, styles, honours and arms\nFranz Joseph's names in the languages of his empire were:\n\n\nName\nFranz Joseph's names in the languages of his empire were:\n\n\nTitles and styles\nHis official grand title after the Ausgleich of 1867 was: \"Francis Joseph the First, by the Grace of God Emperor of Austria, Apostolic King of Hungary, King of Bohemia, King of Dalmatia, Croatia, Slavonia, Galicia and Lodomeria and Illyria;

He was born on August 18, 1830, in Vienna, the eldest son of Archduke Franz Karl and Sophie, Princess of Bavaria. Franz Joseph's early life and reign were marked by significant events, including the Revolutions of 1848, the Hungarian Revolution, and the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867. He died on November 21, 1916, at the age of 86, and was succeeded by his grand-nephew Charles I.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nFranz Joseph was born on August 18, 1830, in the Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna, the eldest son of Archduke Franz Karl and Sophie, Princess of Bavaria. His birth was celebrated as a future emperor, with his mother emphasizing the importance of devotion, responsibility, and diligence. Franz Joseph's uncle, Emperor Ferdinand, was disabled by seizures, and his father was unambitious and retiring, so his mother played a crucial role in raising him as a future emperor.\n\n**Revolutions of 1848**\n\nDuring the Revolutions of 1848, the Austrian Chancellor Prince Klemens von Metternich resigned in March-April 1848. Franz Joseph, who was widely expected to succeed his uncle on the throne, was appointed Governor of Bohemia on April 6, 1848, but never took up the post. Instead, he joined Field Marshal Radetzky on campaign in Italy on April 29, receiving his baptism of fire on May 5 at Santa Lucia.\n\n**Revolution in Hungary**\n\nThe Kingdom of Hungary had an old historic constitution that limited the power of the crown and increased the authority of the parliament since the 13th century. The Hungarian reform laws, known as the April laws, established the fundaments of modern civil and political rights, economic, and societal reforms in the Kingdom of Hungary. The crucial turning point of the Hungarian events was the April laws, which were ratified by Franz Joseph's uncle, King Ferdinand, but arbitrarily revoked by Franz Joseph without any legal competence.\n\n**Constitutional and Legitimacy Problems in Hungary**\n\nOn December 7, 1848, the Diet of Hungary formally refused to acknowledge the title of the new king, as no one could sit on the Hungarian throne without the knowledge and consent of the diet. The kingdom remained \"orphaned\" without a coronation. The situation in Hungary was more severe, and Austrian defeat seemed imminent. Franz Joseph sought help from Russia, requesting the intervention of Tsar Nicolas I to prevent the Hungarian insurrection from developing into a European calamity.\n\n**Military Difficulties in Hungary**\n\nWhile the revolutions in the Austrian territories had been suppressed by 1849, in Hungary, the situation was more severe. The joint army of Russian and Austrian forces defeated the Hungarian forces after the restoration of Habsburg power. Hungary was placed under brutal martial law.\n\n**Assassination Attempt in 1853**\n\nOn February 18, 1853, Franz Joseph survived an assassination attempt by Hungarian nationalist János Libényi. The emperor was taking a stroll with one of his officers, Count Maximilian Karl Lamoral O'Donnell, on a city bastion when Libényi approached him. Libényi struck the emperor from behind with a knife straight at the neck, but the collar of Franz Joseph's uniform saved his life.\n\n**Consolidation of Domestic Policy**\n\nThe next few years saw the seeming recovery of Austria's position on the international scene following the near disasters of 1848-1849. Under Schwarzenberg's guidance, Austria was able to stymie Prussian scheming to create a new German Federation under Prussian leadership, excluding Austria. After Schwarzenberg's premature death in 1852, he could not be replaced by statesmen of equal stature, and the emperor himself effectively took over as prime minister.\n\n**Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867**\n\nThe 1850s witnessed several failures of Austrian external policy, including the Crimean War, the dissolution of its alliance with Russia, and defeat in the Second Italian War of Independence. The setbacks continued in the 1860s with defeat in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, which resulted in the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867.\n\n**Bohemian Question**\n\nFollowing the accession of Franz Joseph to the throne in 1848, the political representatives of the Kingdom of Bohemia hoped and insisted that account should be taken of their historical state rights in the upcoming constitution. They felt the position of Bohemia within the Habsburg monarchy should have been highlighted by a coronation of the new ruler to the king of Bohemia in Prague.\n\n**Foreign Policy**\n\nThe main foreign policy goal of Franz Joseph had been the unification of Germany under the House of Habsburg.

The league had been designed by the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck, as an attempt to maintain the peace of Europe.\n\n**Vatican**\n\nIn 1903, Franz Joseph's veto of Jus exclusivae of Cardinal Mariano Rampolla's election to the papacy was transmitted to the Papal conclave by Cardinal Jan Puzyna de Kosielsko. It was the last use of such a veto, as the new Pope Pius X prohibited future uses and provided for excommunication for any attempt.\n\n**Bosnia and Herzegovina**\n\nDuring the mid-1870s, a series of violent rebellions against Ottoman rule broke out in the Balkans, and the Turks responded with equally violent and oppressive reprisals.

{"title": "Aleksandr_Dugin", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nDugin was born in Moscow, into the family of a colonel-general in the GRU, a Soviet military intelligence agency, and candidate of law, Geliy Aleksandrovich Dugin, and his wife Galina, a doctor and candidate of medicine [25] His father left the family when he was three, but ensured that they had a good standard of living, and helped Dugin out of trouble with the authorities on occasion [26] He was transferred to the customs service due to his son's behaviour in 1983 [27]\n\n\nCareer and political views\nDefunct\n\n\nEarly activism\nIn the 1980s, Dugin was a dissident [39] and an anti-communist [40] Dugin worked as a journalist before becoming involved in politics just before the fall of communism In 1988, he and his friend Geydar Dzhemal joined the ultranationalist and antisemitic group Pamyat (Memory), [28] which would later give rise to Russian fascism [41] For a brief period at the beginning of the 1990s he was close to Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the newly formed Communist Party of the Russian Federation, and probably had a role in formulating its nationalist communist ideology [37] [42] In 1993 he co-founded, together with Eduard Limonov, the National Bolshevik Party, whose nationalistic interpretation of Bolshevism was based on the ideas of Ernst Niekisch He left the party in 1998 following disputes with Limonov [28]\n\n\nPublishing career\nDugin published Foundations of Geopolitics in 1997 The book was published in multiple editions, and is used in university courses on geopolitics, [29] reportedly including the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military [43] It alarmed political scientists in the US, [44] and is sometimes referenced by them as being \"Russia's Manifest Destiny\" [45] In 1997, his article, \"Fascism – Borderless and Red\", described \"national capitalism\" as pre-empting the development of a \"genuine, true, radically revolutionary and consistent, fascist fascism\" in Russia He believes that it was \"by no means the racist and chauvinist aspects of National Socialism that determined the nature of its ideology The excesses of this ideology in Germany are a matter exclusively of the Germans .. while Russian fascism is a combination of natural national conservatism with a passionate desire for true changes.\" [46] The \"Waffen-SS and especially the scientific sector of this organization, Ahnenerbe,\" was \"an intellectual oasis in the framework of the National Socialist regime\", according to him [46]\n\n\nIdeology\nDugin disapproves of liberalism and the West, particularly US hegemony [14] He asserts: \"We are on the side of Stalin and the Soviet Union\" [49] He describes himself as being a conservative: \"We, conservatives, want a strong, solid state, want order and healthy family, positive values, the reinforcing of the importance of religion and the Church in society\" He adds: \"We want patriotic radio, TV, patriotic experts, patriotic clubs We want the media that expresses national interests\" [50]\n\n\nEurasianism, and views on geopolitics\nDugin has theorized the foundation of a \"Euro-Asian empire\" capable of fighting the US-led Western world [55] [56] [57] In this regard, he was the organizer and the first leader of the ultranationalist National Bolshevik Party from 1993 to 1998 (along with Eduard Limonov) and, subsequently, of the National Bolshevik Front and of the Eurasia Party, which then became a non-governmental association Dugin's Eurasitic ideology therefore aims at the unification of all Russian-speaking peoples in a single country [58] [59] His views have been characterised as Fascist by some critics [55] [56] [60] [61]\n\n\nRussian Orthodoxy and Rodnovery\nDugin was baptized at the age of six in the Russian Orthodox church of Michurinsk by his great-grandmother Elena Mikhailovna Kargaltseva Since 1999, he formally embraced a branch of the Old Believers, a Russian religious movement which rejected the 1652–1666 reforms of the official Russian Orthodox Church [74] Dugin's Eurasian philosophy owes much to Traditional Integralism and Nouvelle Droite movements, and as such it resonates with Neopaganism, [75] a category which in this context means the movement of Slavic Native Faith (Rodnovery), especially in the forms of Anastasianism and Ynglism.\n\n\nOther views\nIn Foundations of Geopolitics, Dugin advocated for the dismantling of the People's Republic of China, with Xinjiang, Tibet, Inner Mongolia, and Manchuria becoming buffer states [44]\n\n\nPolitical parties\nIn 1992, Eduard Limonov founded the National Bolshevik Front (NBF) as an amalgamation of six minor groups [80] Aleksandr Dugin was among its earliest members and was instrumental in convincing Limonov to enter politics, and signed the declaration of the founding of the party in 1993 [81] The party first attracted attention in 1992 when two members were arrested for possessing grenades The incident gave the NBP publicity for a boycott campaign they were organizing against Western goods [82]\n\n\nNational Bolshevik Party\nIn 1992, Eduard Limonov

group's founder He said the movement would stress cultural diversity in Russian politics, and oppose \"American style globalisation, and would also resist a return to communism and nationalism.\" It was officially recognized by the Ministry of Justice on 31 May 2001 [42] The Eurasia Party claims support in some military circles and by leaders of the Orthodox Christian faith in Russia The party hopes to play a key role in attempts to resolve the Chechen problem, setting the stage for Dugin's objective of a Russian strategic alliance with European and Middle Eastern states, primarily Iran.\n\n\nStance on Ukraine and role in Russian politics\n\"It is impossible to do without the mobilization of the Russian people, without explaining to them its historical mission, without awakening its deepest beginning, without these words \"brothers and sisters\" Get up, Russian people, wake up, you are called to accomplish great deeds.. All your ancestors, all generations were moving towards this moment, towards this clash with our ontological enemy..

Deborah Snyder producing through Cruel & Unusual Films (now known as The Stone Quarry) [5] The film is not a sequel to Dawn of the Dead but rather a spiritual successor During Dawn of the Dead's production, Snyder got the idea and realized he needed a new origin story to develop the plot and a new incarnation of the living dead He titled the project Army of the Dead as a tribute to the Night of the Living Dead series from George A Romero [6] [7] Snyder clarified his work on the project by saying it was \"not made by committee It's definitely a movie that's incredibly personal and

had to choose the project over The Suicide Squad, and told Digital Spy, \"I had The Suicide Squad where I got to work with my boy  [James Gunn] again, even though it's a smaller role, and then I had Army of the Dead on which I get to work with Zack, I get to build a relationship with Netflix, I get a lead role in a great film – and I get paid a lot more money I had to call James, and I told him,

Producer Deborah Snyder implied that the sequel could be set in New Mexico, an \"intentional\" choice, and said that there was \"still more story to tell, and I know that Zack and Shay have a lot of ideas that are kind of fleshed out If there was an appetite for another film, I think we're ready to go.\" [103] A sequel was confirmed to be in development in July 2021, with Hatten and Snyder working on a story Snyder said he will tackle the project after he finishes working on his next film, Rebel Moon [93] In October 2021, the sequel's title was revealed to be Planet of the Dead [104] That same month, Snyder teased the return of Dieter and Army of Thieves character Gwendoline Starr [105]\n\n\nRebel Moon\nIn an interview with Total Film in November 2023, Snyder stated that the Rebel Moon and Army of the Dead franchises \"definitely a shared universe\" elaborating that the characters from the stalled animated series Army of the Dead: Lost Vegas \"go through a portal into another dimension, and there are characters in that other dimension\" saying that \"one of the aliens (in Rebel Moon) is one of the characters from the animatic (of Army of the Dead: Lost Vegas)\"

{"title": "2023_Covenant_School_shooting", "content": "\nBackground\nThe Covenant School is a private Christian school in the Green Hills neighborhood of Nashville It educates students from pre-kindergarten to the sixth grade It was founded in 2001 as a ministry of Nashville's Covenant Presbyterian Church, a congregation of the Presbyterian Church in America; its enrollment is about 200 students [8]\n\n\nShooting\nHale drove to the school, arriving at 9:54 a.m CDT [9] [10] At 9:57, Hale sent an Instagram message to an old friend saying an earlier post was \"basically a suicide note\" and anticipating dying that day [11] The friend who received the message called a crisis hotline, then contacted the Davidson County Sheriff's Office at 10:13 [12]\n\n\nVictims\nSix people—three students and three staff—were killed at random [5] Five were pronounced dead at a hospital and one at the scene [31] The deceased students were Evelyn Dieckhaus, William Kinney, and Hallie Scruggs, all aged 9 [32] [c] The deceased faculty members were substitute teacher Cynthia Peak, 61; custodian Mike Hill, 61; and head of school Katherine Koonce, 60 [33] In addition, a police officer was injured after cutting his hand on shattered glass [3]\n\n\nPerpetrator\nAiden Hale (previously referred to by the police by his birthname of Audrey Elizabeth Hale) was a 28-year-old former student of the Covenant School and a Nashville resident with no criminal record [34] According to a former headmaster of the Covenant School, Hale attended the school when \"around 10 years of age\" [35] [36] MNPD Police Chief John Drake said Hale was under care for an emotional disorder and had legally purchased seven firearms, including three recovered from the shooting scene, between October 2020 and June 2022 [1]\n\n\nInvestigation and perpetrator's writings\nThe MNPD took the lead of the investigation of the shooting, assisted by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives [41] Two shotguns, one of which was sawed-off, and other evidence were found in a search of the Hales' house [42] Evidence included a detailed map of the school with potential entry points and a manifesto [24] [43] Hale was believed to have undertaken reconnaissance, and had originally considered targeting another location but had decided not to carry out the attack due to the level of security on the premises [43] On April 3, police said Hale planned the shooting for months and fired 152 rounds at the school, 126 of them 5.56 rifle rounds and 26 of them 9mm rounds [44]\n\n\nReactions\nThe Covenant School issued a statement asking for privacy during the law-enforcement investigation [47] Several vigils were held for the casualties A memorial at the school gathered items such as flowers, balloons, and stuffed animals [47] A memorial concert was held at the Fisher Center at Belmont University, with artists including Carrie Underwood, Tyler Hubbard, Colony House, and Thomas Rhett performing All proceeds benefitted the school's staff, students and families [48] The city of Nashville set up a fund to support those affected The Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee also established one for The Covenant School, and GoFundMe created a list with verified similar fundraisers [49] [50]\n\n\nPolicy debate and protests\nIn response to the shooting, U.S President Joe Biden said, \"We have to do more to stop gun violence It's ripping our communities apart, ripping the soul of this nation, ripping at the very soul of the nation.. we have to do more to protect our schools, so they aren't turned into prisons.\" [8] He ordered flags on all federal buildings to be flown at half-staff [24] [60] Nashville Mayor John Cooper called for the state to enact risk-protection laws and take action on gun safety [61] And Tennessee state representative Bob Freeman, a Democrat from Nashville, called for gun reforms in the wake of the shooting [62]\n\n\nControversy over Hale's writings\nIn the immediate aftermath of the shooting, police officers collected what was initially described as a \"manifesto\" authored by Hale [13] David Rausch, the director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, later called the descriptor a \"mischaracterization\", describing the writings as a document detailing Hale's plan and \"journal-type rantings\" [36] The MNPD denied requests for the files by The Tennessean [79] and state senator Todd Gardenhire, [80] who argued, along with some open-government advocates, that Tennessee's public records laws required the release of the writings [29] Metro Nashville Council Member Courtney Johnston said that the FBI had told her that the documents would not be released because they detailed a \"blueprint

Covenant School is a private Christian school in the Green Hills neighborhood of Nashville It educates students from pre-kindergarten to the sixth grade It was founded in 2001 as a ministry of Nashville's Covenant Presbyterian Church, a congregation of the Presbyterian Church in America; its enrollment is about 200 students [8]\n\n\nShooting\nHale drove to the school, arriving at 9:54 a.m CDT [9] [10] At 9:57, Hale sent an Instagram message to an old friend saying an earlier post was \"basically a suicide note\" and anticipating dying that day [11] The friend who received the message called a crisis hotline, then contacted the Davidson County Sheriff's Office at 10:13 [12]\n\n\nVictims\nSix people—three students and three staff—were killed at random [5] Five were pronounced dead at a hospital and one at the scene [31] The deceased students were Evelyn Dieckhaus, William Kinney, and Hallie Scruggs, all aged 9 [32] [c] The deceased faculty members were substitute teacher Cynthia Peak, 61; custodian Mike Hill, 61; and head of school Katherine Koonce, 60 [33] In addition, a police officer was injured after cutting his hand on shattered glass [3]\n\n\nPerpetrator\nAiden Hale (previously referred to by the police by his birthname of Audrey Elizabeth Hale) was a 28-year-old former student of the Covenant School and a Nashville resident with no criminal record [34] According to a former headmaster of the Covenant School, Hale attended the school when \"around 10 years of age\" [35] [36] MNPD Police Chief John Drake said Hale was under care for an emotional disorder and had legally purchased seven firearms, including three recovered from the shooting scene, between October 2020 and June 2022 [1]\n\n\nInvestigation and perpetrator's writings\nThe MNPD took the lead of the investigation of the shooting, assisted by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives [41] Two shotguns, one of which was sawed-off, and other evidence were found in a search of the Hales' house [42] Evidence included a detailed map of the school with potential entry points and a manifesto [24] [43] Hale was believed to have undertaken reconnaissance, and had originally considered targeting another location but had decided not to carry out the attack due to the level of security on the premises [43] On April 3, police said Hale planned the shooting for months and fired 152 rounds at the school, 126 of them 5.56 rifle rounds and 26 of them 9mm rounds [44]\n\n\nReactions\nThe Covenant School issued a statement asking for privacy during the law-enforcement investigation [47] Several vigils were held for the casualties A memorial at the school gathered items such as flowers, balloons, and stuffed animals [47] A memorial concert was held at the Fisher Center at Belmont University, with artists including Carrie Underwood, Tyler Hubbard, Colony House, and Thomas Rhett performing All proceeds benefitted the school's staff, students and families [48] The city of Nashville set up a fund to support those affected The Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee also established one for The Covenant School, and GoFundMe created a list with verified similar fundraisers [49] [50]\n\n\nPolicy debate and protests\nIn response to the shooting, U.S President Joe Biden said, \"We have to do more to stop gun violence It's ripping our communities apart, ripping the soul of this nation, ripping at the very soul of the nation.. we have to do more to protect our schools, so they aren't turned into prisons.\" [8] He ordered flags on all federal buildings to be flown at half-staff [24] [60] Nashville Mayor John Cooper called for the state to enact risk-protection laws and take action on gun safety [61] And Tennessee state representative Bob Freeman, a Democrat from Nashville, called for gun reforms in the wake of the shooting [62]\n\n\nControversy over Hale's writings\nIn the immediate aftermath of the shooting, police officers collected what was initially described as a \"manifesto\" authored by Hale [13] David Rausch, the director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, later called the descriptor a \"mischaracterization\", describing the writings as a document detailing Hale's plan and \"journal-type rantings\" [36] The MNPD denied requests for the files by The Tennessean [79] and state senator Todd Gardenhire, [80] who argued, along with some open-government advocates, that Tennessee's public records laws required the release of the writings [29] Metro Nashville Council Member Courtney Johnston said that the FBI had told her that the documents would not be released because they detailed a \"blueprint of total destruction\" and could inspire other shooters [81] Several Tennessee politicians [80] and public figures—including Elon Musk and Donald Trump Jr.—publicly called for the release of the documents [29] [79] Senator Bill Hagerty said, \"I think people do deserve to know what took place  [and] what was in the mind of this sick person that committed these heinous murders.\" [79] House Republican Caucus Chairman Jeremy Faison attributed the lack of a legislative response to the shootings to the delayed release, saying, \"We cannot possibly address this horrific situation until we know what was in  [the] manifesto.\" [29] [80]\n\n\nLeaks\nOn November 6, 2023, images of three pages of Hale's diary were released by conservative commentator Steven Crowder [93] Nashville Police chief John Drake confirmed the authenticity of the images, [45] and Nashville mayor
