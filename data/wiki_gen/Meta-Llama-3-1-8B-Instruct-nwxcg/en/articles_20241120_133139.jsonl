{"title": "Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "content": "\nHistory and development\nNo mention of an office of vice president was made at the 1787 Constitutional Convention until near the end, when an eleven-member committee on \"Leftover Business\" proposed a method of electing the chief executive (president) [14] Delegates had previously considered the selection of the Senate's presiding officer, deciding that \"the Senate shall choose its own President\", and had agreed that this official would be designated the executive's immediate successor They had also considered the mode of election of the executive but had not reached consensus This all changed on September 4, when the committee recommended that the nation's chief executive be elected by an Electoral College, with each state having a number of presidential electors equal to the sum of that state's allocation of representatives and senators [11] [15]\n\n\nConstitutional Convention\nNo mention of an office of vice president was made at the 1787 Constitutional Convention until near the end, when an eleven-member committee on \"Leftover Business\" proposed a method of electing the chief executive (president) [14] Delegates had previously considered the selection of the Senate's presiding officer, deciding that \"the Senate shall choose its own President\", and had agreed that this official would be designated

the nation's chief executive be elected by an Electoral College, with each state having a number of presidential electors equal to the sum of that state's allocation of representatives and senators [11] [15]\n\n\nEarly vice presidents and Twelfth Amendment\nThe first two vice presidents, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, both of whom gained the office by virtue of being runners-up in presidential contests, presided regularly over Senate proceedings and did much to shape the role of Senate president [19] [20] Several 19th-century vice presidents—such as George Dallas, Levi Morton, and Garret Hobart—followed their example and led effectively, while others were rarely present [19]\n\n\n19th and early 20th centuries\nFor much of its existence, the office of vice president was seen as little more than a minor position John Adams, the first vice president, was the first of many frustrated by the \"complete insignificance\" of the office To his wife Abigail Adams he wrote, \"My country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man .. or his imagination contrived or his imagination conceived; and as I can do neither good nor evil, I must be borne away by others and met the common fate.\" [22] Thomas R Marshall, who served as vice president from 1913 to 1921 under President Woodrow Wilson, lamented: \"Once there were two brothers One ran away to sea; the other was elected Vice President of the United States And nothing was heard of either of them again.\" [23] His successor, Calvin Coolidge, was so obscure that Major League Baseball sent him free passes that misspelled his name, and a fire marshal failed to recognize him when Coolidge's Washington residence was evacuated [24] John Nance Garner, who served as vice president from 1933 to 1941 under President Franklin D Roosevelt, claimed that the vice presidency \"isn't worth a pitcher of warm piss\" [25] Harry Truman, who also served as vice president under Franklin Roosevelt, said the office was as \"useful as a cow's fifth teat\" [26] Walter Bagehot remarked in The English Constitution that \" [t]he framers of the Constitution expected that the vice-president would be elected by the Electoral College as the second wisest man in the country The vice-presidentship being a sinecure, a second-rate man agreeable to the wire-pullers is always smuggled in The chance of succession to the presidentship is too distant to be thought of.\" [27]\n\n\nEmergence of the modern vice presidency\nIn 1933, Franklin D Roosevelt raised the stature of the office by renewing the practice of inviting the vice president to cabinet meetings, which every president since has maintained Roosevelt's first vice president, John Nance Garner, broke with him over the \"court-packing\" issue early in his second term, and became Roosevelt's leading critic At the start of that term, on January 20, 1937, Garner had been the first vice president to be sworn into office on the Capitol steps in the same ceremony with the president, a tradition that continues Prior to that time, vice presidents were traditionally inaugurated at a separate ceremony in the Senate chamber Gerald Ford and Nelson Rockefeller, who were each appointed to the office under the terms of the 25th Amendment, were inaugurated in the House and Senate chambers respectively.\n\n\nConstitutional roles\n \n\n\nPresident of the Senate\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause 4 confers upon the vice president the title \"President of the Senate\", authorizing the vice president to preside over Senate meetings In this capacity, the vice president is responsible for maintaining order and decorum, recognizing members to speak, and interpreting the Senate's rules, practices, and precedent With this position also comes the authority to cast a tie-breaking vote [19] In practice, the number of times vice presidents have exercised this right has varied greatly Incumbent vice president Kamala Harris holds the record at 33 votes, followed by John C Calhoun who had previously held the record at 31 votes; John Adams ranks third with 29 [44] [45] Nine vice presidents, most recently Joe Biden, did not cast any tie-breaking votes [46]\n\n\nPresiding over impeachment trials\nIn their capacity as president of the Senate, the vice president may preside over most impeachment trials of federal officers, although the Constitution does not specifically require it However, whenever the president of the United States is on trial, the Constitution requires that the chief justice of the United States must preside This stipulation was designed to avoid the possible conflict of interest in having the vice president preside over the trial for the removal of the one official standing between them and the presidency [49] In contrast, the Constitution is silent about which federal official would preside were the vice president on trial by the Senate [12] [50] No vice president has ever been impeached, thus leaving it unclear whether an impeached vice president could, as president of the Senate, preside at their own impeachment trial.\n\n\nPresiding over electoral vote counts\nThe Twelfth Amendment provides that the vice president, in their capacity as the president of the Senate, receives the Electoral College votes, and then, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, opens the sealed votes [17] The votes are counted during a joint session of Congress as prescribed by the Electoral Count Act and the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act The former specifies that the president of the Senate presides over the joint session, [51] and the latter clarifies the solely ministerial role the president of the Senate serves in the process [52] The next such joint session will next take place following the 2024 presidential election, on January 6, 2025 (unless Congress sets a different date by law) [18]\n\n\nSuccessor to the U.S. president\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 6 stipulates that the vice president takes over the \"powers and duties\" of the presidency in the event of a president's removal, death, resignation, or inability [57] Even so, it did not clearly state whether the vice president became president or simply acted as president in a case of succession Debate records from the 1787 Constitutional Convention, along with various participants' later writings on the subject, show that the framers of the Constitution intended that the vice president would temporarily exercise the powers and duties of the office in the event of a president's death, disability or removal, but not actually become the president of the United States in their own right [58] [59]\n\n\nActing president\nSections 3 and 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment provide for situations where the president is temporarily or permanently unable to lead, such as if the president has a surgical procedure, becomes seriously ill or injured, or is otherwise unable to discharge the powers or duties of the presidency Section 3 deals with self-declared incapacity, and Section 4 addresses incapacity declared by the joint action of the vice president and of a majority of the Cabinet [66] While Section 4 has never been invoked, Section 3 has been invoked on four occasions by three presidents, first in 1985 When invoked on November 19, 2021, Kamala Harris became the first woman in U.S history to have presidential powers and duties [67]\n\n\nModern roles\nThe present-day power of the office flows primarily from formal and informal delegations of authority from the president and Congress [12] These delegations can vary in significance; for example, the vice president is a statutory member of both the National Security Council and the board of regents of the Smithsonian Institution [10] The extent of the roles and functions of the vice president depend on the specific relationship between the president and the vice president, but often include tasks such as drafter and spokesperson for the administration's policies, adviser to the president, and being a symbol of American concern or support The influence of the vice president in these roles depends almost entirely on the characteristics of the particular administration [68]\n\n\nPresidential advisor\nMost recent vice presidents have been viewed as important presidential advisors Walter Mondale, unlike his immediate predecessors, did not want specific responsibilities to be delegated to him Mondale believed, as he wrote President-elect Jimmy Carter a memo following the 1976 election, that his most important role would be as a \"general adviser\" to the president [38] [69] Al Gore was an important adviser to President Bill Clinton on matters of foreign policy and the environment Dick Cheney was widely regarded as one of President George W Bush's closest confidants Joe Biden asked President Barack Obama to let him always be the \"last person in the room\" when a big decision was made; later, as president himself, Biden adopted this model with his own vice president, Kamala Harris [70] [71]\n\n\nGoverning partner\nRecent vice presidents have been delegated authority by presidents to handle significant issue areas independently Joe Biden (who has held the office of President and Vice President of the United States) has observed that the presidency is \"too big anymore for any one man or woman\" [72] Dick Cheney was considered to hold a tremendous amount of power and frequently made policy decisions on his own, without the knowledge of the president [39] Biden was assigned by Barack Obama to oversee Iraq policy; Obama was said to have said, \"Joe, you do Iraq.\" [73] In February 2020, Donald Trump appointed Mike Pence to lead his response to COVID-19 [74] and, upon his ascension to the presidency, Biden put Kamala Harris in charge of controlling migration at the US–Mexico border [75]\n\n\nCongressional liaison\nThe vice president is often an important liaison between the administration and Congress, especially in situations where the president has not previously served in Congress or served only briefly Vice presidents are often selected as running mates in part due to their legislative relationships, notably including Richard Nixon, Lyndon Johnson, Walter Mondale, Dick Cheney, Joe Biden, and Mike Pence among others In recent years, Dick Cheney held weekly meetings in the Vice President's Room at the United States Capitol, Joe Biden played a key role in bipartisan budget negotiations, and Mike Pence often met with House and Senate Republicans Kamala Harris, the current vice president, presided over a 50–50 split Senate during the 117th Congress, which provided her with a key role in passing legislation.\n\n\nRepresentative at events\nUnder the American system of government the president is both head of state and head of government, [76] and the ceremonial duties of the former position are often delegated to the vice president The vice president will on occasion represent the president and the U.S government at state funerals abroad, or at various events in the United States This often is the most visible role of the vice president The vice president may also meet with other heads of state at times when the administration wishes to demonstrate concern or support but cannot send the president personally.\n\n\nNational Security Council member\nSince 1949, the vice president has legally been a member of the National Security Council Harry Truman, having not been told about any war or post-war plans during his vice presidency (notably the Manhattan Project), recognized that upon assuming the presidency a vice president needed to be already informed on such issues Modern vice presidents have also been included in the president's daily intelligence briefings [70] and frequently participate in meetings in the Situation Room with the president.\n\n\nSelection process\nTo be constitutionally eligible to serve as the nation's vice president, a person must, according to the Twelfth Amendment, meet the eligibility requirements to become president (which are stated in Article II, Section 1, Clause 5) Thus, to serve as vice president, an individual must:\n\n\nEligibility\nTo be constitutionally eligible to serve as the nation's vice president, a person must, according to the Twelfth Amendment, meet the eligibility requirements to become president (which are stated in Article II, Section 1, Clause 5) Thus, to serve as vice president, an individual must:\n\n\nNomination\nThe vice presidential candidates of the major national political parties are formally selected by each party's quadrennial nominating convention, following the selection of the party's presidential candidate The official process is identical to the one by which the presidential candidates are chosen, with delegates placing the names of candidates into nomination, followed by a ballot in which candidates must receive a majority to secure the party's nomination.\n\n\nSelection criteria\nThough the vice president does not need to have any political experience, most major-party vice presidential nominees are current or former United States senators or representatives, with the occasional nominee being a current or former governor, a high-ranking former military officer (active military officers being prohibited under US law from holding political office), or a holder of a major position within the Executive branch In addition, the vice presidential nominee has always been an official resident of a different state than the presidential nominee While nothing in the Constitution prohibits a presidential candidate and his or her running mate being from the same state, the \"inhabitant clause\" of the Twelfth Amendment does mandate that every presidential elector must cast a ballot for at least one candidate who is not from their own state Prior to the 2000 election, both George W Bush and Dick Cheney lived in and voted in Texas To avoid creating a potential problem for Texas's electors, Cheney changed his residency back to Wyoming prior to the campaign [77]\n\n\nElection\nThe vice president is elected indirectly by the voters of each state and the District of Columbia through the Electoral College, a body of electors formed every four years for the sole purpose of electing the president and vice president to concurrent four-year terms Each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the size of its total delegation in both houses of Congress Additionally, the Twenty-third Amendment provides that the District of Columbia is entitled to the number it would have if it were a state, but in no case more than that of the least populous state [86] Currently, all states and D.C select their electors based on a popular election held on Election Day [18] In all but two states, the party whose presidential–vice presidential ticket receives a plurality of popular votes in the state has its entire slate of elector nominees chosen as the state's electors [87] Maine and Nebraska deviate from this winner-take-all practice, awarding two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each congressional district [88] [89]\n\n\nTenure\nPursuant to the Twentieth Amendment, the vice president's term of office begins at noon on January 20, as does the president's [92] The first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as Inauguration Day, were the second terms of President Franklin D Roosevelt and Vice President John Nance Garner in 1937 [93] Previously, Inauguration Day was on March 4 As a result of the date change, both men's first terms (1933–1937) were short of four years by 43 days [94]\n\n\nInauguration\nPursuant to the Twentieth Amendment, the vice president's term of office begins at noon on January 20, as does the president's [92] The first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as Inauguration Day, were the second terms of President Franklin D Roosevelt and Vice President John Nance Garner in 1937 [93] Previously, Inauguration Day was on March 4 As a result of the date change, both men's first terms (1933–1937) were short of four years by 43 days [94]\n\n\nTerm of office\nThe term of office for both the vice president and the president is four years While the Twenty-Second Amendment sets a limit on the number of times an individual can be elected to the presidency (two), [97] there is no such limitation on the office of vice president, meaning an eligible person could hold the office as long as voters continued to vote for electors who in turn would reelect the person to the office; one could even serve under different presidents This has happened twice: George Clinton (1805–1812) served under both Thomas Jefferson and James Madison; and John C Calhoun (1825–1832) served under John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson [19] Additionally, neither the Constitution's eligibility provisions nor the Twenty-second Amendment's presidential term limit explicitly disqualify a twice-elected president from serving as vice president, though it is arguably prohibited by the last sentence of the Twelfth Amendment: \"But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.\" [98] As of the 2020 election cycle, however, no former president has tested the amendment's legal restrictions or meaning by running for the vice presidency [99] [100]\n\n\nImpeachment\nArticle II, Section 4 of the Constitution allows for the removal of federal officials, including the vice president, from office for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" No vice president has ever been impeached.\n\n\nVacancies\nPrior to the ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967, no constitutional provision existed for filling an intra-term vacancy in the vice presidency.\n\n\nOffice and status\nThe vice president's salary in 2019 was $235,100 [104] For 2024, the vice president's salary is $284,600, [105] however, due to a pay freeze in effect since 2019, the actual portion of that salary that is payable remains $235,100 [106] The salary was set by the 1989 Government Salary Reform Act, which also provides an automatic cost of living adjustment for federal employees The vice president does not automatically receive a pension based on that office, but instead receives the same pension as other members of Congress based on their position as president of the Senate [107] The vice president must serve a minimum of two years to qualify for a pension [108]\n\n\nSalary\nThe vice president's salary in 2019 was $235,100 [104] For 2024, the vice president's salary is $284,600, [105] however, due to a pay

their position as president of the Senate [107] The vice president must serve a minimum of two years to qualify for a pension [108]\n\n\nResidence\nThe home of the vice president was designated in 1974, when Congress established Number One Observatory Circle as the official temporary residence of the vice president of the United States In 1966 Congress, concerned about safety and security and mindful of the increasing responsibilities of the office, allotted money ($75,000) to fund construction of a residence for the vice president, but implementation stalled and after eight years the decision was revised, and One Observatory Circle was then designated for the vice president [109] Up until the change, vice presidents lived in homes, apartments, or hotels, and were compensated more like cabinet members and members of Congress, receiving only a housing allowance.\n\n\nTravel and transportation\nThe primary means of long-distance air travel for the vice president is one of two identical Boeing airplanes, which are extensively modified Boeing 757 airliners and are referred to as Air Force Two, while the vice president is on board Any U.S Air Force aircraft the vice president is aboard is referred to as \"Air Force Two\" for the duration of the flight In-country trips are typically handled with just one of the two planes, while overseas trips are handled with both, one primary and one backup.\n\n\nStaff\nThe vice president is supported by personnel in the Office of the Vice President of the United States The office was created in the Reorganization Act of 1939,

vice president's roles in each branch.\n\n\nProtection\nThe U.S Secret Service is in charge with protecting the vice president and the second family As part of their protection, vice presidents, second spouses, their children and other immediate family members, and other prominent persons and locations are assigned Secret Service codenames The use of such names was originally due to security purposes and safety reasons.\n\n\nOffice spaces\nIn the modern era, the vice president makes use of at least four different office spaces These include an office in the West Wing, a ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building near where most of the vice president's staff works, the Vice President's Room on the Senate side of the United States Capitol for meetings with members of Congress, and an office at the vice president's residence.\n\n\nPost–vice presidency\nSince 1977, former presidents and former vice presidents who are elected or re-elected to the Senate are entitled to the largely honorific position of Deputy President pro tempore To date, the only former vice president to have held this title is Hubert Humphrey Also, under the terms of an 1886 Senate resolution, all former vice presidents are entitled to a portrait bust in the Senate wing of the United States Capitol, commemorating their service as presidents of the Senate Dick Cheney is the most recently serving vice president in the collection [110]\n\n\nTimeline\nGraphical timeline listing the vice presidents of the United States:\n\n\nReferences\n \"Both governments could not be understood to exist

The Vice President is the President of the Senate and assumes the presidency if the President is unable to serve. The Vice President is also a member of the Cabinet and supports the President in carrying out their duties.\n\n# History and Development\n\nThe office of Vice President was created by the Constitution in 1787. The Constitution states that the President and Vice President shall be elected by the Electoral College. The first Vice President, John Adams, was elected in 1789 and served under President George Washington. The office of Vice President has been an important part of the executive branch since its creation.\n\n## Constitutional Convention\n\nThe Constitutional Convention was held in 1787 to draft the Constitution. The Convention debated the creation of the office of President and the role of the Vice President. The Convention ultimately decided that the Vice President would be elected by the Electoral College and would serve as the President of the Senate.\n\n## Early Vice Presidents and Twelfth Amendment\n\nThe first two Vice Presidents, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, both gained the office by virtue of being runners-up in presidential contests. They presided regularly over Senate proceedings and did much to shape the role of Senate president. Several 19th-century Vice Presidents, such as George Dallas and Levi Morton, followed their example and led effectively, while others were rarely present.\n\n## 19th and Early 20th Centuries\n\nFor much of its existence, the office of Vice President was seen as little more than a minor position. John Adams, the first Vice President, was the first of many frustrated by the \"complete insignificance\" of the office. Thomas R Marshall, who served as Vice President from 1913 to 1921 under President Woodrow Wilson, lamented: \"Once there were two brothers, one ran away to sea; the other was elected Vice President of the United States, and nothing was heard of either of them again.\"\n\n# Constitutional Roles\n\n## President of the Senate\n\nThe Vice President is the President of the Senate, authorizing the Vice President to preside over Senate meetings. The Vice President is responsible for maintaining order and decorum, recognizing members to speak, and interpreting the Senate's rules, practices, and precedent. The Vice President also has the authority to cast a tie-breaking vote.\n\n## Presiding over Impeachment Trials\n\nThe Vice President may preside over most impeachment trials of federal officers, although the Constitution does not specifically require it. However, whenever the President of the United States is on trial, the Constitution requires that the Chief Justice of the United States must preside.\n\n## Presiding over Electoral Vote Counts\n\nThe Vice President, in their capacity as the President of the Senate, receives the Electoral College votes and then, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, opens the sealed votes. The votes are counted during a joint session of Congress as prescribed by the Electoral Count Act and the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act.\n\n# Successor to the U.S. President\n\n## Acting President\n\nThe Constitution states that the Vice President takes over the \"powers and duties\" of the presidency in the event of a President's removal, death, resignation, or inability. The Twenty-fifth Amendment provides for situations where the President is temporarily or permanently unable to lead.\n\n## Acting President Under the Twenty-fifth Amendment\n\nSections 3 and 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment provide for situations where the President is temporarily or permanently unable to lead. Section 3 deals with self-declared incapacity, and Section 4 addresses incapacity declared by the joint action of the Vice President and of a majority of the Cabinet.\n\n# Modern Roles\n\n## Presidential Advisor\n\nMost recent Vice Presidents have been viewed as important presidential advisors. Walter Mondale, unlike his immediate predecessors, did not want specific responsibilities to be delegated to him. Al Gore was an important adviser to President Bill Clinton on matters of foreign policy and the environment. Dick Cheney was widely regarded as one of President George W. Bush's closest confidants.\n\n## Governing Partner\n\nRecent Vice Presidents have been delegated authority by Presidents to handle significant issue areas independently. Joe Biden was assigned by President Barack Obama to oversee Iraq policy. Donald Trump appointed Mike Pence to lead his response to COVID-19.\n\n## Congressional Liaison\n\nThe Vice President is often an important liaison between the administration and Congress, especially in situations where the President has not previously served in Congress or served only briefly. Dick Cheney held weekly meetings in the Vice President's Room at the United States Capitol. Joe Biden played a key role in bipartisan budget negotiations.\n\n## Representative at Events\n\nThe Vice President will on occasion represent the President and the U.S. government at state funerals abroad, or at various events in the United States. The Vice President may also meet with other heads of state at times when the administration wishes to demonstrate concern or support but cannot send the President personally.\n\n## National Security Council Member\n\nThe Vice President has been included in the President's daily intelligence briefings and frequently participates in meetings in the Situation Room with the President.\n\n# Selection Process\n\n## Eligibility\n\nTo be constitutionally eligible to serve as the nation's Vice President, a person must meet the eligibility requirements to become President.\n\n## Nomination\n\nThe Vice Presidential candidates of the major national political parties are formally selected by each party's quadrennial nominating convention, following the selection of the party's presidential candidate.\n\n## Selection Criteria\n\nThough the Vice President does not need to have any political experience, most major-party Vice Presidential nominees are current or former United States Senators or Representatives.\n\n# Tenure\n\n## Term of Office\n\nThe term of office for both the Vice President and the President is four years. There is no limit on the number of times an individual can be elected to the office of Vice President.\n\n## Vacancies\n\nPrior to the ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967, no constitutional provision existed for filling an intra-term vacancy in the Vice Presidency.\n\n# Post-Vice Presidency\n\n## Deputy President pro tempore\n\nSince 1977, former Presidents and former Vice Presidents who are elected or re-elected to the Senate are entitled to the largely honorific position of Deputy President pro tempore.\n\n## Portraits in the U.S. Capitol\n\nUnder the terms of an 1886 Senate resolution, all former Vice Presidents are entitled to a portrait bust in the Senate wing of the United States Capitol, commemorating their service as Presidents of the Senate.\n\n#

Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Vice_President_of_the_United_States\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory and development\nNo mention of an office of vice president was made at the 1787 Constitutional Convention until near the end, when an eleven-member committee on \"Leftover Business\" proposed a method of electing the chief executive (president) [14] Delegates had previously considered the selection of the Senate's presiding officer, deciding that \"the Senate shall choose its own President\", and had agreed that this official would be designated the executive's immediate successor They had also considered the mode of election of the executive but had not reached consensus This all changed on September 4, when the committee recommended that the nation's chief executive be elected by an Electoral College, with each state having a number of presidential electors equal to the sum of that state's allocation of representatives and senators [11] [15]\n\n\nConstitutional

state's allocation of representatives and senators [11] [15]\n\n\nEarly vice presidents and Twelfth Amendment\nThe first two vice presidents, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, both of whom gained the office by virtue of being runners-up in presidential contests, presided regularly over Senate proceedings and did much to shape the role of Senate president [19] [20] Several 19th-century vice presidents—such as George Dallas, Levi Morton, and Garret Hobart—followed their example and led effectively, while others were rarely present [19]\n\n\n19th and early 20th centuries\nFor much of its existence, the office of vice president was seen as little more than a minor position John Adams, the first vice president, was the first of many frustrated by the \"complete insignificance\" of the office To his wife Abigail Adams he wrote, \"My country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man .. or his imagination contrived or his imagination conceived; and as I can do neither good nor evil, I must be borne away by others and met the common fate.\" [22] Thomas R Marshall, who served as vice president from 1913 to 1921 under President Woodrow Wilson, lamented: \"Once there were two brothers One ran away to sea; the other was elected Vice President of the United States And nothing was heard of either of them again.\" [23] His successor, Calvin Coolidge, was so obscure that Major League Baseball sent him free passes that misspelled his name, and a fire marshal failed to recognize him when Coolidge's Washington residence was evacuated [24] John Nance Garner, who served as vice president from 1933 to 1941 under President Franklin D Roosevelt, claimed that the vice presidency \"isn't worth a pitcher of warm piss\" [25] Harry Truman, who also served as vice president under Franklin Roosevelt, said the office was as \"useful as a cow's fifth teat\" [26] Walter Bagehot remarked in The English Constitution that \" [t]he framers of the Constitution expected that the vice-president would be elected by the Electoral College as the second wisest man in the country The vice-presidentship being a sinecure, a second-rate man agreeable to the wire-pullers is always smuggled in The chance of succession to the presidentship is too distant to be thought of.\" [27]\n\n\nEmergence of the modern vice presidency\nIn 1933, Franklin D Roosevelt raised the stature of the office by renewing the practice of inviting the vice president to cabinet meetings, which every president since has maintained Roosevelt's first vice president, John Nance Garner, broke with him over the \"court-packing\" issue early in his second term, and became Roosevelt's leading critic At the start of that term, on January 20, 1937, Garner had been the first vice president to be sworn into office on the Capitol steps in the same ceremony with the president, a tradition that continues Prior to that time, vice presidents were traditionally inaugurated at a separate ceremony in the Senate chamber Gerald Ford and Nelson Rockefeller, who were each appointed to the office under the terms of the 25th Amendment, were inaugurated in the House and Senate chambers respectively.\n\n\nConstitutional roles\n \n\n\nPresident of the Senate\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause 4 confers upon the vice president the title \"President of the Senate\", authorizing the vice president to preside over Senate meetings In this capacity, the vice president is responsible for maintaining order and decorum, recognizing members to speak, and interpreting the Senate's rules, practices, and precedent With this position also comes the authority to cast a tie-breaking vote [19] In practice, the number of times vice presidents have exercised this right has varied greatly Incumbent vice president Kamala Harris holds the record at 33 votes, followed by John C Calhoun who had previously held the record at 31 votes; John Adams ranks third with 29 [44] [45] Nine vice presidents, most recently Joe Biden, did not cast any tie-breaking votes [46]\n\n\nPresiding over impeachment trials\nIn their capacity as president of the Senate, the vice president may preside over most impeachment trials of federal officers, although the Constitution does not specifically require it However, whenever the president of the United States is on trial, the Constitution requires that the chief justice of the United States must preside This stipulation was designed to avoid the possible conflict of interest in having the vice president preside over the trial for the removal of the one official standing between them and the presidency [49] In contrast, the Constitution is silent about which federal official would preside were the vice president on trial by the Senate [12] [50] No vice president has ever been impeached, thus leaving it unclear whether an impeached vice president could, as president of the Senate, preside at their own impeachment trial.\n\n\nPresiding over electoral vote counts\nThe Twelfth Amendment provides that the vice president, in their capacity as the president of the Senate, receives the Electoral College votes, and then, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, opens the sealed votes [17] The votes are counted during a joint session of Congress as prescribed by the Electoral Count Act and the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act The former specifies that the president of the Senate presides over the joint session, [51] and the latter clarifies the solely ministerial role the president of the Senate serves in the process [52] The next such joint session will next take place following the 2024 presidential election, on January 6, 2025 (unless Congress sets a different date by law) [18]\n\n\nSuccessor to the U.S. president\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 6 stipulates that the vice president takes over the \"powers and duties\" of the presidency in the event of a president's removal, death, resignation, or inability [57] Even so, it did not clearly state whether the vice president became president or simply acted as president in a case of succession Debate records from the 1787 Constitutional Convention, along with various participants' later writings on the subject, show that the framers of the Constitution intended that the vice president would temporarily exercise the powers and duties of the office in the event of a president's death, disability or removal, but not actually become the president of the United States in their own right [58] [59]\n\n\nActing president\nSections 3 and 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment provide for situations where the president is temporarily or permanently unable to lead, such as if the president has a surgical procedure, becomes seriously ill or injured, or is otherwise unable to discharge the powers or duties of the presidency Section 3 deals with self-declared incapacity, and Section 4 addresses incapacity declared by the joint action of the vice president and of a majority of the Cabinet [66] While Section 4 has never been invoked, Section 3 has been invoked on four occasions by three presidents, first in 1985 When invoked on November 19, 2021, Kamala Harris became the first woman in U.S history to have presidential powers and duties [67]\n\n\nModern roles\nThe present-day power of the office flows primarily from formal and informal delegations of authority from the president and Congress [12] These delegations can vary in significance; for example, the vice president is a statutory member of both the National Security Council and the board of regents of the Smithsonian Institution [10] The extent of the roles and functions of the vice president depend on the specific relationship between the president and the vice president, but often include tasks such as drafter and spokesperson for the administration's policies, adviser to the president, and being a symbol of American concern or support The influence of the vice president in these roles depends almost entirely on the characteristics of the particular administration [68]\n\n\nPresidential advisor\nMost recent vice presidents have been viewed as important presidential advisors Walter Mondale, unlike his immediate predecessors, did not want specific responsibilities to be delegated to him Mondale believed, as he wrote President-elect Jimmy Carter a memo following the 1976 election, that his most important role would be as a \"general adviser\" to the president [38] [69] Al Gore was an important adviser to President Bill Clinton on matters of foreign policy and the environment Dick Cheney was widely regarded as one of President George W Bush's closest confidants Joe Biden asked President Barack Obama to let him always be the \"last person in the room\" when a big decision was made; later, as president himself, Biden adopted this model with his own vice president, Kamala Harris [70] [71]\n\n\nGoverning partner\nRecent vice presidents have been delegated authority by presidents to handle significant issue areas independently Joe Biden (who has held the office of President and Vice President of the United States) has observed that the presidency is \"too big anymore for any one man or woman\" [72] Dick Cheney was considered to hold a tremendous amount of power and frequently made policy decisions on his own, without the knowledge of the president [39] Biden was assigned by Barack Obama to oversee Iraq policy; Obama was said to have said, \"Joe, you do Iraq.\" [73] In February 2020, Donald Trump appointed Mike Pence to lead his response to COVID-19 [74] and, upon his ascension to the presidency, Biden put Kamala Harris in charge of controlling migration at the US–Mexico border [75]\n\n\nCongressional liaison\nThe vice president is often an important liaison between the administration and Congress, especially in situations where the president has not previously served in Congress or served only briefly Vice presidents are often selected as running mates in part due to their legislative relationships, notably including Richard Nixon, Lyndon Johnson, Walter Mondale, Dick Cheney, Joe Biden, and Mike Pence among others In recent years, Dick Cheney held weekly meetings in the Vice President's Room at the United States Capitol, Joe Biden played a key role in bipartisan budget negotiations, and Mike Pence often met with House and Senate Republicans Kamala Harris, the current vice president, presided over a 50–50 split Senate during the 117th Congress, which provided her with a key role in passing legislation.\n\n\nRepresentative at events\nUnder the American system of government the president is both head of state and head of government, [76] and the ceremonial duties of the former position are often delegated to the vice president The vice president will on occasion represent the president and the U.S government at state funerals abroad, or at various events in the United States This often is the most visible role of the vice president The vice president may also meet with other heads of state at times when the administration wishes to demonstrate concern or support but cannot send the president personally.\n\n\nNational Security Council member\nSince 1949, the vice president has legally been a member of the National Security Council Harry Truman, having not been told about any war or post-war plans during his vice presidency (notably the Manhattan Project), recognized that upon assuming the presidency a vice president needed to be already informed on such issues Modern vice presidents have also been included in the president's daily intelligence briefings [70] and frequently participate in meetings in the Situation Room with the president.\n\n\nSelection process\nTo be constitutionally eligible to serve as the nation's vice president, a person must, according to the Twelfth Amendment, meet the eligibility requirements to become president (which are stated in Article II, Section 1, Clause 5) Thus, to serve as vice president, an individual must:\n\n\nEligibility\nTo be constitutionally eligible to serve as the nation's vice president, a person must, according to the Twelfth Amendment, meet the eligibility requirements to become president (which are stated in Article II, Section 1, Clause 5) Thus, to serve as vice president, an individual must:\n\n\nNomination\nThe vice presidential candidates of the major national political parties are formally selected by each party's quadrennial nominating convention, following the selection of the party's presidential candidate The official process is identical to the one by which the presidential candidates are chosen, with delegates placing the names of candidates into nomination, followed by a ballot in which candidates must receive a majority to secure the party's nomination.\n\n\nSelection criteria\nThough the vice president does not need to have any political experience, most major-party vice presidential nominees are current or former United States senators or representatives, with the occasional nominee being a current or former governor, a high-ranking former military officer (active military officers being prohibited under US law from holding political office), or a holder of a major position within the Executive branch In addition, the vice presidential nominee has always been an official resident of a different state than the presidential nominee While nothing in the Constitution prohibits a presidential candidate and his or her running mate being from the same state, the \"inhabitant clause\" of the Twelfth Amendment does mandate that every presidential elector must cast a ballot for at least one candidate who is not from their own state Prior to the 2000 election, both George W Bush and Dick Cheney lived in and voted in Texas To avoid creating a potential problem for Texas's electors, Cheney changed his residency back to Wyoming prior to the campaign [77]\n\n\nElection\nThe vice president is elected indirectly by the voters of each state and the District of Columbia through the Electoral College, a body of electors formed every four years for the sole purpose of electing the president and vice president to concurrent four-year terms Each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the size of its total delegation in both houses of Congress Additionally, the Twenty-third Amendment provides that the District of Columbia is entitled to the number it would have if it were a state, but in no case more than that of the least populous state [86] Currently, all states and D.C select their electors based on a popular election held on Election Day [18] In all but two states, the party whose presidential–vice presidential ticket receives a plurality of popular votes in the state has its entire slate of elector nominees chosen as the state's electors [87] Maine and Nebraska deviate from this winner-take-all practice, awarding two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each congressional district [88] [89]\n\n\nTenure\nPursuant to the Twentieth Amendment, the vice president's term of office begins at noon on January 20, as does the president's [92] The first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as Inauguration Day, were the second terms of President Franklin D Roosevelt and Vice President John Nance Garner in 1937 [93] Previously, Inauguration Day was on March 4 As a result of the date change, both men's first terms (1933–1937) were short of four years by 43 days [94]\n\n\nInauguration\nPursuant to the Twentieth Amendment, the vice president's term of office begins at noon on January 20, as does the president's [92] The first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as Inauguration Day, were the second terms of President Franklin D Roosevelt and Vice President John Nance Garner in 1937 [93] Previously, Inauguration Day was on March 4 As a result of the date change, both men's first terms (1933–1937) were short of four years by 43 days [94]\n\n\nTerm of office\nThe term of office for both the vice president and the president is four years While the Twenty-Second Amendment sets a limit on the number of times an individual can be elected to the presidency (two), [97] there is no such limitation on the office of vice president, meaning an eligible person could hold the office as long as voters continued to vote for electors who in turn would reelect the person to the office; one could even serve under different presidents This has happened twice: George Clinton (1805–1812) served under both Thomas Jefferson and James Madison; and John C Calhoun (1825–1832) served under John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson [19] Additionally, neither the Constitution's eligibility provisions nor the Twenty-second Amendment's presidential term limit explicitly disqualify a twice-elected president from serving as vice president, though it is arguably prohibited by the last sentence of the Twelfth Amendment: \"But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.\" [98] As of the 2020 election cycle, however, no former president has tested the amendment's legal restrictions or meaning by running for the vice presidency [99] [100]\n\n\nImpeachment\nArticle II, Section 4 of the Constitution allows for the removal of federal officials, including the vice president, from office for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" No vice president has ever been impeached.\n\n\nVacancies\nPrior to the ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967, no constitutional provision existed for filling an intra-term vacancy in the vice presidency.\n\n\nOffice and status\nThe vice president's salary in 2019 was $235,100 [104] For 2024, the vice president's salary is $284,600, [105] however, due to a pay freeze in effect since 2019, the actual portion of that salary that is payable remains $235,100 [106] The salary was set by the 1989 Government Salary Reform Act, which also provides an automatic cost of living adjustment for federal employees The vice president does not automatically receive a pension based on that office, but instead receives the same pension as other members of Congress based on their position as president of the Senate [107] The vice president must serve a minimum of two years to qualify for a pension [108]\n\n\nSalary\nThe vice president's salary in 2019 was $235,100 [104] For 2024, the vice president's salary is $284,600, [105] however, due to a pay freeze in effect since 2019, the actual portion of that salary that is payable remains $235,100 [106] The salary was set by the 1989 Government Salary Reform Act, which also provides an automatic cost

their position as president of the Senate [107] The vice president must serve a minimum of two years to qualify for a pension [108]\n\n\nResidence\nThe home of the vice president was designated in 1974, when Congress established Number One Observatory Circle as the official temporary residence of the vice president of the United States In 1966 Congress, concerned about safety and security and mindful of the increasing responsibilities of the office, allotted money ($75,000) to fund construction of a residence for the vice president, but implementation stalled and after eight years the decision was revised, and One Observatory Circle was then designated for the vice president [109] Up until the change, vice presidents lived in homes, apartments, or hotels, and were compensated more like cabinet members and members of Congress, receiving only a housing allowance.\n\n\nTravel and transportation\nThe primary means of long-distance air travel for the vice president is one of two identical Boeing airplanes, which are extensively modified Boeing 757 airliners and are referred to as Air Force Two, while the vice president is on board Any U.S Air Force aircraft the vice president is aboard is referred to as \"Air Force Two\" for the duration of the flight In-country trips are typically handled with just one of the two planes, while overseas trips are handled with both, one primary and one backup.\n\n\nStaff\nThe vice president is supported by personnel in the Office of the Vice President of the United States The office was created in the Reorganization Act of 1939, which included an \"office of the Vice President\" under the Executive Office of the President Salary for the staff is provided by both legislative and executive branch appropriations, in light of the vice president's roles in each branch.\n\n\nProtection\nThe U.S Secret Service is in charge with protecting the vice president and the second family As part of their protection, vice presidents, second spouses, their children and other immediate family members, and other prominent persons and locations are assigned Secret Service codenames The use of such names was originally due to security purposes and safety reasons.\n\n\nOffice spaces\nIn the modern era, the vice president makes use of at least four different office spaces These include an office in the West Wing, a ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building near where most of the vice president's staff works, the Vice President's Room on the Senate side of the United States Capitol for meetings with members of Congress, and an office at the vice president's residence.\n\n\nPost–vice presidency\nSince 1977, former presidents and former vice presidents who are elected or re-elected to the Senate are entitled to the largely honorific position of Deputy President pro tempore To date, the only former vice president to have held this title is Hubert Humphrey Also, under the terms of an 1886 Senate resolution, all former vice presidents are entitled to a portrait bust in the Senate wing of the United States Capitol, commemorating their service as presidents of the Senate Dick Cheney is the most recently serving vice president in the collection [110]\n\n\nTimeline\nGraphical timeline listing the vice presidents of the United States:\n\n\nReferences\n \"Both governments could not be understood to exist

The company is headquartered in the 8th arrondissement of Paris, France, and is the world's largest luxury goods company in terms of revenue.\n\n**History**\n\nLVMH was formed in 1987 through the merger of Moët Hennessy and Louis Vuitton. The two companies, which were controlled by the initial family owners, had different visions for the future of the group. Alain Chevalier, the chairman of Moët Hennessy, and Henri Racamier, the chairman of Louis Vuitton, began to disagree on the direction of the company. Bernard Arnault, a businessman and investor, was invited to invest in LVMH and quickly took control of the company. Contrary to popular belief, Bernard Arnault did not create LVMH, but rather took over the company and transformed it into the luxury conglomerate it is today.\n\nUnder Arnault's leadership, LVMH successfully integrated various famous aspirational brands into a single group, inspiring other luxury companies to do the same. Today, LVMH is a global leader in the luxury goods industry, with a portfolio of over 70 brands, including Louis Vuitton, Moët Hennessy, Christian Dior, Fendi, and Givenchy, among others.\n\n**Corporate Structure**\n\nLVMH is a publicly traded company listed on the Euronext Paris stock exchange. The company is led by Bernard Arnault, who serves as the Chairman and CEO. LVMH is organized into several business groups, including Fashion & Leather Goods, Wines & Spirits, Perfumes & Cosmetics, and Watchmaking.\n\n**Shareholders**\n\nAs of 2009, LVMH held 66% of the drinks division, Moët Hennessy, with the remaining 34% held by Diageo. LVMH is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index, which is a leading stock market index in Europe.\n\n**Senior Leadership**\n\nBernard Arnault has served as LVMH's Chairman and CEO since January 1989. Alain Chevalier was the Chairman of LVMH from 1987 until Arnault took over the role.\n\n**Media Group**\n\nIn 2007, Arnault acquired France's leading financial newspaper, Les Echos, from the British company Pearson for €240 million. The acquisition marked a significant expansion of LVMH's media presence and solidified the company's position as a major player in the French media landscape.\n\n**Subsidiaries**\n\nLVMH has a diverse portfolio of over 70 brands, including:\n\n* Louis Vuitton\n* Moët Hennessy\n* Christian Dior\n* Fendi\n* Givenchy\n* Berluti\n* Chaumet\n* Hublot\n* TAG Heuer\n* Bulgari\n* and many others\n\n**E-commerce**\n\nIn 2018, LVMH invested in online fashion search business Lyst, launching an e-commerce initiative to expand the company's online presence and capture younger shoppers. The investment marked a significant step towards LVMH's digital transformation and its efforts to stay ahead of the curve in the rapidly evolving e-commerce landscape.\n\n**Financial Data**\n\nLVMH reported revenue of €53.7 billion in 2022, with 27% of its revenue generated from sales in the Americas and 30% from Asia excluding Japan. The company's revenue growth has been driven by the success of its luxury brands, particularly Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior.\n\n**Philanthropy, Sponsorships, and Events**\n\nLVMH is a major patron of art in France, supporting exhibitions such as \"Le grand monde d'Andy Warhol\" and \"Picasso et les maîtres\" at the Grand Palais in Paris. The company also endorses the patronage of \"l'atelier d'Alberto Giacometti\" and \"Yves Klein\" at the Centre Georges Pompidou.\n\n**Visual Arts**\n\nLVMH's commitment to art is evident in its support of various exhibitions and artists. The company has a long history of partnering with artists and institutions to promote art and culture in France.\n\n**Fashion**\n\nIn 2013, LVMH launched the LVMH Young Fashion Designer Prize, which comes with a €300,000 grant and a year of mentoring. The prize is designed to support emerging fashion designers and recognize their talent and creativity.\n\n**Music**\n\nLVMH lends Stradivarius violins to young talented musicians, including Maxim Vengerov and Laurent Korcia. The company's support of music is a testament to its commitment to the arts and its desire to promote cultural excellence.\n\n**Humanitarian Aid**\n\nIn 2019, Bernard Arnault announced that LVMH would donate $11 million to help fight the 2019 Brazil wildfires. The company's commitment to humanitarian aid reflects its values of responsibility and commitment to social causes.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nLVMH has been involved in several controversies over the years, including the firing of John Galliano, the designer of Christian Dior, in 2011. Galliano was accused of making anti-Semitic remarks, which sparked outrage and led to his dismissal.\n\nIn 2012, LVMH hired Sebastian Suhl, a former Prada COO, as the CEO of Givenchy. However, Suhl was embroiled in a controversy surrounding a female discrimination case at Prada, which raised concerns about his suitability for the role.\n\nIn 2021, LVMH paid €10 million to settle claims in Paris to end several criminal investigations related to a former French intelligence chief, Bernard Squarcini, who was accused of spying for the company.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLVMH is a leading luxury goods company with a rich history and a diverse portfolio of brands. The company's commitment to innovation, creativity, and cultural excellence has made it a leader in the luxury industry. While LVMH has faced several controversies over the years, its commitment to social responsibility and humanitarian aid reflects its values of responsibility and commitment to social causes.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"LVMH\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nIn 1987, Moet Hennessy and Louis Vuitton merged to create LVMH Following different visions of the future of the Group, Alain Chevalier and Henri Racamier, respective leaders of MH and LV, started to fight Racamier invited Bernard Arnault to invest in LVMH Rapidly, Arnault succeeded in taking control of LVMH at the expense of the initial family owners Contrary to what is often indicated, Bernard Arnault never created LVMH  [18] Their successful integration of various famous aspirational brands into a single group inspired other luxury companies to do the same Thus, the French conglomerate Kering and the Swiss-based Richemont have also created extended portfolios of luxury brands [citation needed] LVMH is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index [19]\n\n\nCorporate structure\nLVMH is headquartered in the 8th arrondissement of Paris, France [12]\n\n\nShareholders\nAs of 2009, LVMH held 66% of the drinks division, Moët Hennessy, with the remaining 34% held by Diageo [59]\n\n\nSenior leadership\nBernard Arnault has served as LVMH's chairman and CEO since January 1989 [63] Alain Chevalier was chairman from 1987 until Arnault took over the role [64]\n\n\nMedia group\nIn 2007, Arnault bought France's leading financial newspaper, Les Echos, from the British company Pearson for 240 million euros (US$262 million) after a negotiating period of four months [66]\n\n\nSubsidiaries\nA partial list, including some of LVMH's best-known brands and subsidiaries: [57] [76]\n\n\nE-commerce\nOn 24 May 2018, LVMH launched an e-commerce initiative by investing in online fashion search business Lyst, as a way for LVMH's luxury brands to expand their presence online and capture younger shoppers [78] LVMH contributed to Lyst's $60 million funding round, which also included access to LVMH's international expertise, designed to drive Lyst's global expansion [79]\n\n\nFinancial data\nLVMH made 27% of its 2022 revenue from sales in the Americas  30% of its sales revenue came from Asia excluding Japan [88]\n\n\nSales by region\nLVMH made 27% of its 2022 revenue from sales in the Americas  30% of its sales revenue came from Asia excluding Japan [88]\n\n\nPhilanthropy, sponsorships and events\nLVMH is a major patron of art in France The group supported about ten exhibitions as \"Le grand monde d’Andy Warhol\" [90] and \"Picasso et les maîtres\" [91] at le Grand Palais in Paris LVMH also endorsed the patronage of \"l'atelier d'Alberto Giacometti\" and \"Yves Klein\" at Centre Georges Pompidou.\n\n\nVisual arts\nLVMH is a major patron of art in France The group supported about ten exhibitions as \"Le grand monde d’Andy Warhol\" [90] and \"Picasso et les maîtres\" [91] at le Grand Palais in Paris LVMH also endorsed the patronage of \"l'atelier d'Alberto Giacometti\" and \"Yves Klein\" at Centre Georges Pompidou.\n\n\nFashion\nIn November 2013, LVMH created the LVMH Young Fashion Designer Prize, which comes with a €300,000 grant with a year of mentoring;

{"title": "2012_Summer_Olympics", "content": "\nBidding process\nLondon was chosen over Birmingham to represent Great Britain's bid by the British Olympic Association.\n\n\nDevelopment and preparations\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (LOCOG) was created to oversee the staging of the Games, and held its first board meeting on 3 October 2005 [35] The committee, chaired by Lord Coe, was in charge of implementing and staging the Games, while the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA), established in April 2006, was in charge of construction of the venues and infrastructure [35] [36]\n\n\nVenues\nThe 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games used a mixture of new venues, existing and historic facilities, and temporary facilities, some of them in well-known locations such as Hyde Park and Horse Guards Parade After the Games, some of the new facilities would be reused in their Olympic form, while others will be resized or relocated [42]\n\n\nPublic transport\nIOC's initial evaluation felt that, if transport improvements were delivered in time for the Games, London would cope [58] Transport for London (TfL) carried out numerous improvements in preparation for 2012, including the expansion of the London Overground's East London Line, upgrades to the Docklands Light Railway and the North London Line, and the introduction of a new \"Javelin\" high-speed rail service [59] According to Network Rail, an additional 4,000 train services operated during the Games, and train operators ran longer trains during the day [60] During the Games, Stratford International station was not served by any international services (just as it had not been before the Games), [61] westbound trains did not stop at Hackney Wick railway station, [62] and Pudding Mill Lane DLR station closed entirely during the Games [63]\n\n\nCost and financing\nA study from Oxford University found that the sports-related costs of London 2012 amounted to US$15 billion, compared with $4.6 billion for Rio 2016, $40–44 billion for Beijing 2008, and $51 billion for Sochi 2014 (the most expensive Olympics in history) London 2012 went over budget by 76% in real terms, measured from bid to completion The cost per athlete was $1.4 million [79] This does not include wider costs for urban and transport infrastructure, which often equal or exceed the sports-related costs.\n\n\nVolunteers\nUnpaid volunteers known as Games Makers performed a variety of tasks before and during the Games [81] A target of 70,000 volunteers was set as early as 2004 [82] When recruitment took place in 2010, more than 240,000 applications were received [83] Sebastian Coe said in February 2012, \"Our Games Makers will contribute a total of around eight million volunteer hours during the Games and the Games simply wouldn't happen without them\" [84] The volunteers wore clothing that included purple and red polo shirts and jackets, beige trousers, grey socks and grey-and-white trainers, which they collected from the Uniform Distribution and Accreditation Centre Volunteers also wore photo accreditation badges that were also worn by officials, athletes, family members and media, which gained them access to specific venues and buildings around the site.\n\n\nTicketing\nOrganisers estimated that some 8 million tickets would be available for the Olympic Games, [85] and 1.5 million tickets for the Paralympic Games [85] LOCOG aimed to raise £375–£400 million in ticket sales There were also free events such as marathon, triathlon and road cycling, [86] although, for the first time in Olympic history, the sailing events were ticketed [87] Eventually, more than 7,000,000 tickets were sold [88] Following IOC rules, people applied for tickets from the NOC of their country of residence European Union residents were able to apply for tickets in any EU country [89]\n\n\nCountdown\nDuring the closing ceremony of the 2008 Olympics, the Olympic Flag was formally handed over from the Mayor of Beijing to the Mayor of London This was followed by a section highlighting London, [96] One month later, the Olympic and Paralympic flags were raised outside the London City Hall [97]\n\n\nSecurity\nThe police led the security operation (named Operation Olympics by the Ministry of Defence), with 10,000 officers available, supported by 13,500 members of the British Armed Forces Naval and air assets were deployed as part of the security operation, including ships situated in the Thames, Typhoon fighter jets and surface-to-air missiles; [101] it was the biggest security operation Britain had faced in decades The cost of security increased from £282 million to £553 million, and the figure of 13,500 armed forces personnel was greater than the number deployed at the time in Afghanistan [102] The Metropolitan Police and the Royal Marines carried out security exercises in preparation for the Olympics on 19 January 2012, with 50 marine police officers in rigid inflatables and fast response boats, joined by up to 100 military personnel and a Royal Navy Lynx helicopter [103]\n\n\nMedals\nApproximately 4,700 [106] Olympic and Paralympic medals were produced by the Royal Mint at Llantrisant [107] They were designed by David Watkins (Olympics) and Lin Cheung (Paralympics) [108] 99% of the gold, silver and copper was donated by Rio Tinto from a mine in Salt Lake County, Utah in the U.S [109] The remaining 1% came from a Mongolian mine [110] Each medal weighs 375–400 g (13.2–14.1 oz), has a diameter of 85 mm (3.3 in) and is 7 mm (0.28 in) thick, with the sport and discipline engraved on the rim [111] The obverse, as is traditional, features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, stepping from the Panathinaiko Stadium that hosted the first modern Olympic Games in 1896, with Parthenon in the background; the reverse features the Games logo, the River Thames and a series of lines representing \"the energy of athletes and a sense of pulling together\" [112] The medals were transferred to the Tower of London vaults on 2 July 2012 for storage [111]\n\n\nTorch relay\nThe Olympics torch relay ran from 19 May to 27 July 2012, before the Games Plans for the relay were developed in 2010–11, with the torch-bearer selection process announced on 18 May 2011 [115] The torch was designed by Edward Barber and Jay Osgerby.\n\n\nEnvironmental policy\nThe Olympic Park was planned to incorporate 45 hectares of wildlife habitat, with a total of 525 bird boxes and 150 bat boxes Local waterways and riverbanks were enhanced as part of the process [121] Renewable energy also featured at the Olympics It was originally planned to provide 20% of the energy for the Olympic Park and Village from renewable technologies; however, only 9% of it was achieved [122] Proposals to meet the original target included large-scale on-site wind turbines and hydroelectric generators in the River Thames, but these plans were scrapped for safety reasons [123] The focus subsequently moved to installing solar panels on some buildings, and providing the opportunity to recover energy from waste Where it could not be reused or recycled, food packaging for use at the Olympics—including fast-food wrappers, sandwich boxes and drink cartons—was made from compostable materials like starch and cellulose-based bioplastics After use, many of these materials were suitable for anaerobic digestion (AD), allowing them to be made into renewable energy [124]\n\n\nCultural Olympiad\nThe Olympic Charter, the set of rules and guidelines for the organization of the Olympic Games and for governing the Olympic Movement, states that\n\n\nOpening ceremony\nTitled \"The Isles of Wonder\", the opening ceremony began at

1924 Olympics, was a recurring theme in promotions for the 2012 Olympics [196] A digitally re-mastered version of Chariots of Fire was released on 13 July 2012 and screened in over 100 UK cinemas as part of the celebrations, [197] and a 2012 stage adaptation ran in London theatres from 9 May 2012 to 5 January 2013 [198] The film's theme tune was performed during the opening ceremony by the London

[201] the athletes' use of social media, and several political issues After a complicated lottery process, thousands of people failed to secure seats for the events they wanted, but a large number of empty seats were observed early in the Games, even at some of the most popular events There was speculation that this was due to a failure of corporate sponsors to make use of tickets they had received [88]\n\n\nDrug testing and doping violations\nIt was announced before the Summer Games that half of all the competitors would be tested for drugs, with 150 scientists set to take 6,000 samples between the start of the Games and the end of the Paralympic Games [207] Every competitor who won a medal was also tested The Olympic laboratory tested up to 400 samples every day for more

Olympics**\n\nThe 2012 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXX Olympiad, were held in London, United Kingdom from July 27 to August 12, 2012. The Games were the 26th edition of the modern Olympic Games and were attended by 10,520 athletes from 204 National Olympic Committees (NOCs).\n\n**Bidding Process**\n\nThe bidding process for the 2012 Summer Olympics began in 2004, with nine cities submitting initial bids. The candidate cities were: London, Paris, New York City, Moscow, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, Madrid, Istanbul, and Leipzig. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) shortlisted the candidates to Paris and London in 2005, and London was chosen over Paris in 2005 by a vote of 54-50.\n\n**Development and Preparations**\n\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (LOCOG) was created in 2005 to oversee the staging of the Games. LOCOG was chaired by Lord Coe and was responsible for implementing and staging the Games. The Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA), established in 2006, was responsible for constructing the venues and infrastructure for the Games.\n\n**Venues**\n\nThe 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games used a mixture of new venues, existing and historic facilities, and temporary facilities. Some of the new venues included the Olympic Stadium, the Aquatics Centre, and the Velodrome. The existing venues included Wimbledon, Lord's Cricket Ground, and the Royal Albert Hall. The temporary facilities included the basketball arena and the badminton venue.\n\n**Public Transport**\n\nTransport for London (TfL) carried out numerous improvements in preparation for the 2012 Olympics. These improvements included the expansion of the London Overground's East London Line, upgrades to the Docklands Light Railway and the North London Line, and the introduction of a new \"Javelin\" high-speed rail service. An additional 4,000 train services operated during the Games, and train operators ran longer trains during the day.\n\n**Cost and Financing**\n\nA study from Oxford University found that the sports-related costs of London 2012 amounted to $15 billion, compared with $4.6 billion for Rio 2016, $40-44 billion for Beijing 2008, and $51 billion for Sochi 2014. London 2012 went over budget by 76% in real terms, measured from bid to completion. The cost per athlete was $1.4 million.\n\n**Volunteers**\n\nUnpaid volunteers known as Games Makers performed a variety of tasks before and during the Games. A target of 70,000 volunteers was set as early as 2004. When recruitment took place in 2010, more than 240,000 applications were received. Sebastian Coe said in February 2012, \"Our Games Makers will contribute a total of around eight million volunteer hours during the Games and the Games simply wouldn't happen without them.\"\n\n**Ticketing**\n\nOrganisers estimated that some 8 million tickets would be available for the Olympic Games, and 1.5 million tickets for the Paralympic Games. LOCOG aimed to raise $375-400 million in ticket sales. There were also free events such as the marathon, triathlon, and road cycling. Eventually, more than 7 million tickets were sold.\n\n**Countdown**\n\nDuring the closing ceremony of the 2008 Olympics, the Olympic Flag was formally handed over from the Mayor of Beijing to the Mayor of London. This was followed by a section highlighting London. One month later, the Olympic and Paralympic flags were raised outside London City Hall.\n\n**Security**\n\nThe police led the security operation, with 10,000 officers available, supported by 13,500 members of the British Armed Forces. Naval and air assets were deployed as part of the security operation, including ships situated in the Thames, Typhoon fighter jets, and surface-to-air missiles. The cost of security increased from $282 million to $553 million, and the figure of 13,500 armed forces personnel was greater than the number deployed at the time in Afghanistan.\n\n**Medals**\n\nApproximately 4,700 Olympic and Paralympic medals were produced by the Royal Mint at Llantrisant. They were designed by David Watkins (Olympics) and Lin Cheung (Paralympics). 99% of the gold, silver, and copper was donated by Rio Tinto from a mine in Salt Lake County, Utah in the U.S. Each medal weighs 375-400 g, has a diameter of 85 mm, and is 7 mm thick.

preparations\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (LOCOG) was created to oversee the staging of the Games, and held its first board meeting on 3 October 2005 [35] The committee, chaired by Lord Coe, was in charge of implementing and staging the Games, while the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA), established in April 2006, was in charge of construction of the venues and infrastructure [35] [36]\n\n\nVenues\nThe 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games used a mixture of new venues, existing and historic facilities, and temporary facilities, some of them in well-known locations such as Hyde Park and Horse Guards Parade After the Games, some of the new facilities would be reused in their Olympic form, while others will be resized or relocated [42]\n\n\nPublic transport\nIOC's initial evaluation felt that, if transport improvements were delivered in time for the Games, London would cope [58] Transport for London (TfL) carried out numerous improvements in preparation for 2012, including the expansion of the London Overground's East London Line, upgrades to the Docklands Light Railway and the North London Line, and the introduction of a new \"Javelin\" high-speed rail service [59] According to Network Rail, an additional 4,000 train services operated during the Games, and train operators ran longer trains during the day [60] During the Games, Stratford International station was not served by any international services (just as it had not been before the Games), [61] westbound trains did not stop at Hackney Wick railway station, [62] and Pudding Mill Lane DLR station closed entirely during the Games [63]\n\n\nCost and financing\nA study from Oxford University found that the sports-related costs of London 2012 amounted to US$15 billion, compared with $4.6 billion for Rio 2016, $40–44 billion for Beijing 2008, and $51 billion for Sochi 2014 (the most expensive Olympics in history) London 2012 went over budget by 76% in real terms, measured from bid to completion The cost per athlete was $1.4 million [79] This does not include wider costs for urban and transport infrastructure, which often equal or exceed the sports-related costs.\n\n\nVolunteers\nUnpaid volunteers known as Games Makers performed a variety of tasks before and during the Games [81] A target of 70,000 volunteers was set as early as 2004 [82] When recruitment took place in 2010, more than 240,000 applications were received [83] Sebastian Coe said in February 2012, \"Our Games Makers will contribute a total of around eight million volunteer hours during the Games and the Games simply wouldn't happen without them\" [84] The volunteers wore clothing that included purple and red polo shirts and jackets, beige trousers, grey socks and grey-and-white trainers, which they collected from the Uniform Distribution and Accreditation Centre Volunteers also wore photo accreditation badges that were also worn by officials, athletes, family members and media, which gained them access to specific venues and buildings around the site.\n\n\nTicketing\nOrganisers estimated that some 8 million tickets would be available for the Olympic Games, [85] and 1.5 million tickets for the Paralympic Games [85] LOCOG aimed to raise £375–£400 million in ticket sales There were also free events such as marathon, triathlon and road cycling, [86] although, for the first time in Olympic history, the sailing events were ticketed [87] Eventually, more than 7,000,000 tickets were sold [88] Following IOC rules, people applied for tickets from the NOC of their country of residence European Union residents were able to apply for tickets in any EU country [89]\n\n\nCountdown\nDuring the closing ceremony of the 2008 Olympics, the Olympic Flag was formally handed over from the Mayor of Beijing to the Mayor of London This was followed by a section highlighting London, [96] One month later, the Olympic and Paralympic flags were raised outside the

British Armed Forces Naval and air assets were deployed as part of the security operation, including ships situated in the Thames, Typhoon fighter jets and surface-to-air missiles; [101] it was the biggest security operation Britain had faced in decades The cost of security increased from £282 million to £553 million, and the figure of 13,500 armed forces personnel was greater than the number deployed at the time in Afghanistan [102] The Metropolitan Police and the Royal Marines carried out security exercises in preparation for the Olympics on 19 January 2012, with 50 marine police officers in rigid inflatables and fast response boats, joined by up to 100 military personnel and a Royal Navy Lynx helicopter [103]\n\n\nMedals\nApproximately 4,700 [106] Olympic and Paralympic medals were produced by the Royal Mint at Llantrisant [107] They were designed by David Watkins (Olympics) and Lin Cheung (Paralympics) [108] 99% of the gold, silver and copper was donated by Rio Tinto from a mine in Salt Lake County, Utah in the U.S [109] The remaining 1% came from a Mongolian mine [110] Each medal weighs 375–400 g (13.2–14.1 oz), has a diameter of 85 mm (3.3 in) and is 7 mm (0.28 in) thick, with the sport and discipline engraved on the rim [111] The obverse, as is traditional, features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, stepping from the Panathinaiko Stadium that hosted the first modern Olympic Games in 1896, with Parthenon in the background; the reverse features the Games logo, the River Thames and a series of lines representing \"the energy of athletes and a sense

reused or recycled, food packaging for use at the Olympics—including fast-food wrappers, sandwich boxes and drink cartons—was made from compostable materials like starch and cellulose-based bioplastics After use, many of these materials were suitable for anaerobic digestion (AD), allowing them to be made into renewable energy [124]\n\n\nCultural Olympiad\nThe Olympic Charter, the set of

[201] the athletes' use of social media, and several political issues After a complicated lottery process, thousands of people failed to secure seats for the events they wanted, but a large number of empty seats were observed early in the Games, even at some of the most popular events There was speculation that this was due to a failure of corporate sponsors to make use of tickets they had received [88]\n\n\nDrug testing and doping violations\nIt was announced before the Summer Games that half of all the competitors would be tested for drugs, with 150 scientists set to take 6,000

His name is often translated to \"traveller\" or \"wanderer,\" reflecting the moon's constant movement across the night sky. As a deity, Khonsu was revered for his role in maintaining the balance of the universe and ensuring the fertility of the land.\n\n# Mythology\n\nKhonsu's name means 'traveller' and therefore reflects the fact that the Moon (referred to as Iah in Egyptian) travels across the night sky. He was also referred to by the titles Embracer, Pathfinder, Defender, and healer, and was thought to watch over those who travel at night. As the god of light in the night, Khonsu was invoked to protect against wild animals, and aid with healing. It was said that when Khonsu caused the crescent moon to shine, women conceived, cattle became fertile, and all nostrils and every throat were filled with fresh air.\n\n## Role in Egyptian Cosmology\n\nIn Egyptian mythology, Khonsu was considered one of the principal deities of the Ennead, a pantheon of nine gods and goddesses worshipped in the city of Thebes. He was often depicted as a youthful god, associated with the moon's crescent phase, and was said to be the son of Amun and Mut. As a member of the Ennead, Khonsu played a crucial role in maintaining the balance of the universe, ensuring the cyclical nature of life and death.\n\n## Associations with other Deities\n\nKhonsu had close links to other divine children such as Horus and Shu. Like Horus, he was associated with protection and healing, and was often depicted with the head of a falcon. In some mythological accounts, Khonsu was said to have been born from the tears of the goddess Nut, emphasizing his connection to the celestial realm.\n\n# Attributes\n\nIn art, Khonsu is typically depicted as a mummy with the symbol of childhood, a sidelock of hair, as well as the menat necklace with crook and flail. He has close links to other divine children such as Horus and Shu. He was also portrayed with the head of a falcon and like Horus, with whom he is associated as a protector and healer, adorned with the moon disk and crescent moon.\n\n## Symbolism\n\nThe crescent moon was a symbol closely associated with Khonsu, representing his role as a deity of the lunar cycle. The menat necklace, a symbol of fertility and abundance, was also often depicted with Khonsu, highlighting his association with the land's fertility. The falcon, a symbol of protection and healing, was also an important attribute of Khonsu, emphasizing his role in safeguarding the people and the land.\n\n# In Popular Culture\n\nKhonsu appears as a character in Marvel Comics, where the spelling of his name was changed to 'Khonshu'. In the comics, the character Moon Knight is the avatar of Khonshu and is also known as \"The Fist of Khonshu\". Khonshu grants the protagonist Marc Spector supernatural abilities to fight evil in his name, enhancing his strength, endurance, and reflexes depending upon the phases of the moon, but also slowly drives him insane. Khonshu's nature changes depending on the writer; Doug Moench portrays Khonshu as a neutral figure, but later writers make him more active and malicious.\n\n## Adaptations in the Marvel Cinematic Universe\n\nKhonshu also appears in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) television series Moon Knight, voiced by F Murray Abraham.

{"title": "Gulf_War", "content": "\nNames\nThe war is also known under other names, such as the Second Gulf War (not to be confused with the 2003 Iraq War, also referred to as such [27]), Persian Gulf War, Kuwait War, First Iraq War, or Iraq War [28] [29] [30] [b] before the term \"Iraq War\" became identified instead with the 2003 Iraq War (also known in the U.S as \"Operation Iraqi Freedom\") [31] The war was named Umm al-Ma'arik (\"mother of all battles\") by Iraqi officials [32] After the U.S invasion of Iraq in 2003, the Gulf War of 1990–1991 is often known as the \"First Iraq War\" [33]\n\n\nOperational names\nMost of the coalition states used various names for their operations and the war's operational phases These are sometimes incorrectly used as the conflict's overall name, especially the US Desert Storm:\n\n\nCampaign names\nThe US divided the conflict into three major campaigns:\n\n\nBackground\nThroughout the Cold War, Iraq had been an ally of the Soviet Union, and there was a history of friction between Iraq and the United States [37] The US was concerned with Iraq's position on Israeli–Palestinian politics The US also disliked Iraqi support for Palestinian militant groups, which led to Iraq's inclusion on the developing US list of State Sponsors of Terrorism in December 1979 [38]\n\n\nInvasion of Kuwait\nThe result of the Jeddah talks was an Iraqi demand for $10 billion [65] to cover the lost revenues from Rumaila; Kuwait offered $500 million [65] The Iraqi response was to immediately order an invasion, [66] which started on 2 August 1990 [67] with the bombing of Kuwait's capital, Kuwait City.\n\n\nKuwaiti resistance movement\nKuwaitis founded a local armed resistance movement following the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait [75] [76] [77] The Kuwaiti resistance's  [ar] casualty rate far exceeded that of the coalition military forces and Western hostages [78] The resistance predominantly consisted of ordinary citizens who lacked any form of training and supervision [78]\n\n\nRun-up to the war\nA key element of US political, military and energy economic planning occurred in early 1984 The Iran–Iraq war had been going on for five years by that time and both sides sustained significant casualties, reaching into the hundreds of thousands Within President Ronald Reagan's National Security Council concern was growing that the war could spread beyond the boundaries of the two belligerents A National Security Planning Group meeting was formed, chaired by then Vice President George H W Bush, to review US options It was determined that the conflict would likely spread into Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states, but that the United States had little capability to defend the region Furthermore, it was determined that a prolonged war in the region would induce much higher oil prices and threaten the fragile recovery of the world economy, which was just beginning to gain momentum On 22 May 1984, President Reagan was briefed on the project conclusions in the Oval Office by William Flynn Martin who had served as the head of the NSC staff that organized the study (The full declassified presentation can be seen here: [79]) The conclusions were threefold: first, oil stocks needed to be increased among members of the International Energy Agency and, if necessary, released early if the oil market was disrupted; second, the United States needed to beef up the security of friendly Arab states in the region; and third, an embargo should be placed on sales of military equipment to Iran and Iraq The plan was approved by President Reagan and later affirmed by the G7 leaders headed by the United Kingdom's Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, in the London Summit of 1984 The plan was implemented and became the basis for US preparedness to respond to the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait in 1991 [citation needed]\n\n\nDiplomatic means\nA key element of US political, military and energy economic planning occurred in early

Summit of 1984 The plan was implemented and became the basis for US preparedness to respond to the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait in 1991 [citation needed]\n\n\nMilitary means\n\n\n\nCreating a coalition\nA series of UN Security Council resolutions and Arab League resolutions were passed regarding Iraq's invasion of Kuwait Resolution 678, passed on 29 November 1990, gave Iraq a withdrawal deadline until 15 January 1991 and authorized \"all necessary means to uphold and implement Resolution 660\", and a diplomatic formulation authorizing the use of force if Iraq failed to comply [107]\n\n\nJustification for intervention\nThe US and the UN gave several public justifications for involvement in the conflict, the most prominent being the Iraqi violation of Kuwaiti territorial integrity In addition, the US moved to support its ally Saudi Arabia, whose importance in the region, and as a key supplier of oil, made it of considerable geopolitical importance Shortly after the Iraqi invasion, US Defense Secretary Dick Cheney made the first of several visits to Saudi Arabia where King Fahd requested US military assistance During a speech in a special joint session of the US Congress given on 11 September 1990, Bush summed up the reasons with the following remarks: \"Within three days, 120,000 Iraqi troops with 850 tanks had poured into Kuwait and moved south to threaten Saudi Arabia It was then that I decided to act to check that aggression.\" [119]\n\n\nPublic relations campaign targeting the public\nAlthough the Iraqi military committed human rights abuses during the invasion, the alleged incidents that received the most publicity in the US were fabrications of the public relations firm hired by the government of Kuwait to persuade Americans to support military intervention [122] Shortly after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the organization Citizens for a Free Kuwait was formed in the US It hired the public relations firm Hill & Knowlton for about $11 million, paid by Kuwait's government [123]\n\n\nEarly battles\nThe Gulf War began with an extensive aerial bombing campaign on 16 January 1991 For 42 consecutive days and nights, the coalition forces subjected Iraq to one of the most intensive air bombardments in military history The coalition flew over 100,000 sorties, dropping 88,500 tonnes of bombs, [130] which widely destroyed military and civilian infrastructure [citation needed]\n\n\nAir campaign\nThe Gulf War began with an extensive aerial bombing campaign on 16 January 1991 For 42 consecutive days and nights, the coalition forces subjected Iraq to one of the most intensive air bombardments in military history The coalition flew over 100,000 sorties, dropping 88,500 tonnes of bombs, [130] which widely destroyed military and civilian infrastructure [citation needed]\n\n\nIraqi Scud missile strikes on Israel and Saudi Arabia\nIraq's government made no secret that it would attack Israel if invaded Prior to the war's start, in the aftermath of the failed US–Iraq peace talks in Geneva, Switzerland, a reporter asked Iraq's English-speaking Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz: \"Mr Foreign Minister, if war starts .. will you attack Israel?\" His response was: \"Yes, absolutely, yes.\" [134] [135]\n\n\nIraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia (Battle of Khafji)\nOn 29 January, Iraqi forces attacked and occupied the lightly defended Saudi city of Khafji with tanks and infantry The Battle of Khafji ended two days later when the Iraqis were driven back by the Saudi Arabian National Guard, supported by Qatari forces and US Marines [151] The allied forces used extensive artillery fire [citation needed]\n\n\nCounter reconnaissance\nTask Force 1-41 Infantry was a US Army heavy battalion task force from the 2nd Armored Division (Forward) It was the spearhead of VII Corps, consisting primarily of the 1st Battalion, 41st Infantry Regiment, 3rd Battalion, 66th Armor Regiment, and the 4th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery Regiment Task Force 1–41 was the first coalition force to breach the Saudi Arabian border on 15 February 1991, and to conduct ground combat operations in Iraq engaging in direct and indirect fire fights with the enemy on 17 February 1991 [154] Shortly after arrival in theatre Task Force 1–41 Infantry received a counter-reconnaissance mission [155] 1–41 Infantry was assisted by the 1st Squadron, 4th Armored Cavalry Regiment This joint effort would become known as Task Force Iron [156] Counter-reconnaissance generally includes destroying or repelling the enemy's reconnaissance elements and denying their commander any observation of friendly forces On 15 February 1991 4th Battalion of the 3rd Field Artillery Regiment fired on a trailer and a few trucks in the Iraqi sector observing American forces [157]\n\n\nBreach\nTask Force 1–41 Infantry was the first coalition force to breach the Saudi Arabian border on 15 February 1991 and conduct ground combat operations in Iraq engaging in direct and indirect fire fights with the enemy on 17 February 1991 [154] Prior to this action the Task Force's primary fire support battalion, 4th Battalion of the 3rd Field Artillery Regiment, participated in a massive artillery preparation Around 300 guns from multiple countries participated in the artillery barrage Over 14,000 rounds were fired during these missions M270 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems contributed an additional 4,900 rockets fired at Iraqi targets [165] Iraq lost close to 22 artillery battalions during the initial stages of this barrage, [166] including the destruction of approximately 396 Iraqi artillery pieces [166]\n\n\nGround campaign\nA 90,000 round artillery preparation fire on Iraqi defensive positions preceded the major ground assault, lasting 2.5 hours [177] 1st Infantry Division Artillery, which included 4-3 FA battalion, was decisive during artillery combat operations performing multiple raids and fire missions These combat operations resulted in the destruction of 50 enemy tanks, 139 APCs, 30 air defense systems, 152 artillery pieces, 27 missile launchers, 108 mortars, and 548 wheeled vehicles, 61 trench lines and bunker positions, 92 dug in and open infantry targets, and 34 logistical sites [178] The ground campaign consisted of three or possibly four of the largest tank battles in American military history [179] [180] The battles at 73 Easting, Norfolk, and Medina Ridge are well noted for their historical significance [179] Some consider the Battle of Medina Ridge the largest tank battle of the war [154] [181] Other sources consider the Battle of Norfolk the largest tank battle of the war and the second largest tank battle in American history [181] The U.S Marine Corps also fought the biggest tank battle in its history at Kuwait International Airport [180] The U.S 3rd Armored Division also fought a significant battle at Objective Dorset not far from where the Battle of Norfolk was taking place The U.S 3rd Armored Division destroyed approximately 300 enemy combat vehicles during this particular encounter with Iraqi forces [154]\n\n\nLiberation of Kuwait\nUS decoy attacks by air attacks and naval gunfire the night before Kuwait's liberation were designed to make the Iraqis believe the main coalition ground attack would focus on central Kuwait [citation needed] For months, American units in Saudi Arabia had been under almost constant Iraqi artillery fire, as well as threats from Scud missiles and chemical attacks On 24 February 1991, the 1st and 2nd Marine Divisions and the 1st Light Armored Infantry Battalion crossed into Kuwait and headed toward Kuwait City They encountered trenches, barbed wire, and minefields However, these positions were poorly defended, and were overrun in the first few hours Several tank battles took place, but otherwise coalition troops encountered minimal resistance, as most Iraqi troops surrendered The general pattern was that the Iraqis would put up a short fight before surrendering However, Iraqi air defenses shot down nine US aircraft Meanwhile, forces from Arab states advanced into Kuwait from the east, encountering little resistance and suffering few casualties [citation needed]\n\n\nInitial moves into Iraq\nThe war's ground phase was officially designated Operation Desert Saber [citation needed] The first units to move into Iraq were three patrols of the British Special Air Service's B squadron, call signs Bravo One Zero, Bravo Two Zero, and Bravo Three Zero, in late January These eight-man patrols landed behind Iraqi lines to gather intelligence on the movements of Scud mobile missile launchers, which could not be detected from the air, as they were hidden under bridges and camouflage netting during the day [228] Other objectives included the destruction of the launchers and their fiber-optic communications arrays that lay in pipelines and relayed coordinates to the TEL operators launching attacks against Israel The operations were designed to prevent any possible Israeli intervention Due to lack of sufficient ground cover to carry out their assignment, One Zero and Three Zero abandoned their operations, while Two Zero remained, and was later compromised, with only Sergeant Chris Ryan escaping to Syria [citation needed]\n\n\nCoalition forces enter Iraq\nShortly afterwards, the US VII Corps, in full strength and spearheaded by the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment, launched an armored attack into Iraq early on 24 February, just to the west of Kuwait, surprising Iraqi forces Simultaneously, the US XVIII Airborne Corps launched a sweeping \"left-hook\" attack across southern Iraq's largely undefended desert, led by the US 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment and the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) This movement's left flank was protected by the French Division Daguet The 101st Airborne Division conducted a combat air assault into enemy territory [229] The 101st Airborne Division had struck 249 km (155 mi) behind enemy lines [229] It was the deepest air assault operation in history [229] Approximately 400 helicopters transported 2,000 soldiers into Iraq where they destroyed Iraqi columns trying to flee westward and prevented the escape of Iraqi forces [231] The 101st Airborne Division travelled a further 80 to 100 km (50 to 60 mi) into Iraq [229] By nightfall, the 101st cut off Highway 8 which was a vital supply line running between Basra and the Iraqi forces [229] The 101st had lost 16 soldiers in action during the 100-hour war and captured thousands of enemy prisoners of war [citation needed]\n\n\nEnd of active hostilities\nIn coalition-occupied Iraqi territory, a peace conference was held where a ceasefire agreement was negotiated and signed by both sides At the conference, Iraq was authorized to fly armed helicopters on their side of the temporary border, ostensibly for government transit due to the damage done to civilian infrastructure Soon after, these helicopters and much of Iraq's military were used to fight an uprising in the south On March 1, 1991, one day after the Gulf War ceasefire, a revolt broke out in Basra against the Iraqi government The uprising spread within days to all of the largest Shia cities in southern Iraq: Najaf, Amarah, Diwaniya, Hilla, Karbala, Kut, Nasiriyah and Samawah The rebellions were encouraged by an airing of \"The Voice of Free Iraq\" on 24 February 1991, which was broadcast from a CIA-run radio station out of Saudi Arabia The Arabic service of the Voice of America supported the uprising by stating that the rebellion was well supported, and that they would soon be liberated from Saddam [234]\n\n\nCoalition involvement\nCoalition members included Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, [241] Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Honduras, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Kuwait, Luxembourg, Morocco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Niger, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, [242] Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Syria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States [243] The United States had 700,000 troops [244] [245]\n\n\nAustralia\nAustralia contributed a Naval Task Group, which formed part of the multi-national fleet in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, under Operation Damask In addition, medical teams were deployed aboard a US hospital ship, and a naval clearance diving team took part in de-mining Kuwait's port facilities following the end of combat operations Australian forces experienced a number of incidents in the first number of weeks of the Desert Storm Campaign including the detection of significant air threats from Iraq as a part of the outer perimeter of Battle Force Zulu; the detection of free sea floating mines and assistance to the aircraft carrier USS Midway The Australian Task Force was also placed at great risk with regard to the sea mine threat, with HMAS Brisbane narrowly avoiding a mine The Australians played a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against Iraq following Kuwait's invasion Following the war's end, Australia deployed a medical unit on Operation Habitat to northern Iraq as part of Operation Provide Comfort [247]\n\n\nArgentina\nArgentina was the only South American country to participate in the 1991 Gulf War It sent a destroyer, ARA Almirante Brown (D-10), a corvette, ARA Spiro (P-43) (later replaced by another corvette, ARA Rosales (P-42)) and a supply ship, ARA Bahía San Blas (B-4) to participate on the United Nations blockade and sea control effort of the Persian Gulf The success of \"Operación Alfil\" (English: \"Operation Bishop\") with more than 700 interceptions and 25,000 nautical miles (46,000 km) sailed in the theatre of operations helped to overcome the so-called \"Malvinas syndrome\" [248]\n\n\nCanada\nCanada was one of the first countries to condemn Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and it quickly agreed to join the US-led coalition In August 1990, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney committed the Canadian Forces to deploy a Naval Task Group The destroyers HMCS Terra Nova and HMCS Athabaskan joined the maritime interdiction force supported by the supply ship HMCS Protecteur in Operation Friction The Canadian Task Group led the coalition's maritime logistics forces in the Persian Gulf A fourth ship, HMCS Huron, arrived in-theater after hostilities had ceased and was the first allied ship to visit Kuwait [citation needed]\n\n\nFrance\nThe second largest European contingent was from France, which committed 18,000 troops [243] Operating on the left flank of the US XVIII Airborne Corps, the French Army force was the Division Daguet, including troops from the French Foreign Legion Initially, the French operated independently under national command and control, but coordinated closely with the Americans (via CENTCOM) and Saudis In January, the Division was placed under the tactical control of the XVIII Airborne Corps France also deployed several combat aircraft and naval units The French called their contribution Opération Daguet [citation needed]\n\n\nItaly\nFollowing the invasion and annexation of Kuwait by Iraq, on September 25, 1990, the Italian Government sent eight multirole fighter bombers Tornado IDS (plus two spare) in the Persian Gulf, belonging to the 6º, 36º and 50º Stormo, which were deployed at the Al Dhafra Air Base, near Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates [251] [252] [253] During the 42 days of war, Italian fighters made 226 sorties for a total of 589 flight hours The Italian Air Force recorded the loss of a single aircraft in the Gulf War The use of Italian aircraft as part of the Desert Storm operation represented the first operational employment in combat missions of Italian Air Force aircraft since the end of World War II [citation needed]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nThe United Kingdom committed the largest contingent of any European state that participated in the war's combat operations Operation Granby was the code name for the operations in the Persian Gulf British Army regiments (mainly with the 1st Armoured Division), Royal Air Force, Naval Air Squadrons and Royal Navy vessels were mobilized in the Persian Gulf Both Royal Air Force and Naval Air Squadrons, using various aircraft, operated from airbases in Saudi Arabia and Naval Air Squadrons from various vessels in the Persian Gulf The United Kingdom played a major role in the Battle of Norfolk, where its forces destroyed over 200 Iraqi tanks and a large quantity of other vehicles [208] [209] After 48 hours of combat the British 1st Armoured Division destroyed or isolated four Iraqi infantry divisions (the 26th, 48th, 31st, and 25th) and overran the Iraqi 52nd Armored Division in several sharp engagements [209]\n\n\nCasualties\nOver 1,000 Kuwaiti civilians were killed by Iraqis [256] More than 600 Kuwaitis went missing during Iraq's occupation, [257] and approximately 375 remains were found in mass graves in Iraq The increased importance of air attacks from both coalition warplanes and cruise missiles led to controversy over the number of civilian deaths caused during Desert Storm's initial stages Within Desert Storm's first 24 hours, more than 1,000 sorties were flown, many against targets in Baghdad The city was the target of heavy bombing, as it was the seat of power for Saddam and the Iraqi forces' command and control This ultimately led to civilian casualties [citation needed]\n\n\nCivilian\nOver 1,000 Kuwaiti civilians were killed by Iraqis [256] More than 600 Kuwaitis went missing during Iraq's occupation, [257] and approximately 375 remains were found in mass graves in Iraq The increased importance of air attacks from both coalition warplanes and cruise missiles led to controversy over the number of civilian deaths caused during Desert Storm's initial stages Within Desert Storm's first 24 hours, more than 1,000 sorties were flown, many against targets in Baghdad The city was the target of heavy bombing, as it was the seat of power for Saddam and the Iraqi forces' command and control This ultimately led to civilian casualties [citation needed]\n\n\nIraqi\nA United Nations report in March 1991 described the effect on Iraq of the US-led bombing campaign as \"near apocalyptic\", bringing back Iraq to the \"pre-industrial age.\" [268] The exact number of Iraqi combat casualties is unknown, but is believed to have been heavy Some estimate that Iraq sustained between 20,000 and 35,000 fatalities [262] A report commissioned by the US Air Force estimated 10,000–12,000 Iraqi combat deaths in the air campaign, and as many as 10,000 casualties in the ground war [269] This analysis is based on Iraqi prisoner of war reports [citation needed]\n\n\nCoalition\nThe US Department of Defense reports that US forces suffered 148 battle-related deaths (35 to friendly fire [285]), with one pilot listed as MIA (his remains were found and identified in August 2009) A further 145 Americans died in non-combat accidents [272] The UK suffered 47 deaths (nine to friendly fire, all by US forces), France nine, [272] and the other countries, not including Kuwait, suffered 37 deaths (18 Saudis, one Egyptian, six UAE and three Qataris) [272] At least 605 Kuwaiti soldiers were still missing 10 years after their capture [286]\n\n\nFriendly fire\nWhile the death toll among coalition forces engaging Iraqi combatants was very low, a substantial number of deaths were caused by accidental attacks from other Allied units Of the 148 US troops who died in battle, 24% were killed by friendly fire, a total of 35 service personnel [290] A further 11 died in detonations of coalition munitions Nine British military personnel were killed in a friendly fire incident when a USAF A-10 Thunderbolt II destroyed a group of two Warrior IFVs [citation needed]\n\n\nAftermath\nMany returning coalition soldiers reported illnesses following their action in the war, a phenomenon known as Gulf War syndrome (GWS) or Gulf War illness (GWI) Common symptoms reported are chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, and gastrointestinal disorder [291] There has been widespread speculation and disagreement about the causes of the illness and the possibly related birth defects Researchers found that infants born to male veterans of the 1991 war had higher rates of two types of heart valve defects Some children born after the war to Gulf War veterans had a certain kidney defect that was not found in Gulf War veterans' children born before the war Researchers have said that they did not have enough information to link birth defects with exposure to toxic substances [292]\n\n\nGulf War illness\nMany returning coalition soldiers reported illnesses following their action in the war, a phenomenon known as Gulf War syndrome (GWS) or Gulf War illness (GWI) Common symptoms reported are chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, and gastrointestinal disorder [291] There has been widespread speculation and disagreement about the causes of the illness and the possibly related birth defects Researchers found that infants born to male veterans of the 1991 war had higher rates of two types of heart valve defects Some children born after the war to Gulf War veterans had a certain kidney defect that was not found in Gulf War veterans' children born before the war Researchers have said that they did not have enough information to link birth defects with exposure to toxic substances [292]\n\n\nEffects of depleted uranium\nThe US military used depleted uranium in tank kinetic energy penetrators and 20–30 mm (0.79–1.18 in) cannon ordnance Significant controversy regarding the long term safety of depleted uranium exists, including claims of pyrophoric, genotoxic, and teratogenic heavy metal effects Many have cited its use during the war as a contributing factor to a number of major health issues in veterans and in surrounding civilian populations, including in birth defects and child cancer rates Scientific opinion on the risk is mixed [294] [295] [296] In 2004, Iraq had the highest mortality rate due to leukemia of any country [297] [298] [299] [300]\n\n\nHighway of Death\nIn the night of 26–27 February 1991, some Iraqi forces began leaving Kuwait on the main highway north of Al Jahra in a column of some 1,400 vehicles A patrolling E-8 Joint STARS aircraft observed the retreating forces and relayed the information to the DDM-8 air operations center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [citation needed] These vehicles and the retreating soldiers were subsequently attacked by two A-10 aircraft, resulting in a 60 kilometres (37 mi) stretch of highway strewn with debris—the Highway of Death New York Times reporter Maureen Dowd wrote, \"With the Iraqi leader facing military defeat, Mr Bush decided that he would rather gamble on a violent and potentially unpopular ground war than risk the alternative: an imperfect settlement hammered out by the Soviets and Iraqis that world opinion might accept as tolerable.\" [303]\n\n\nBulldozer assault\nAnother incident during the war highlighted the question of large-scale Iraqi combat deaths This was the \"bulldozer assault\", wherein two brigades from the US 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized) were faced with a large and complex trench network, as part of the heavily fortified \"Saddam Hussein Line\" After some deliberation, they opted to use anti-mine plows mounted on tanks and combat earthmovers to simply plow over and bury alive the defending Iraqi soldiers Not a single American was killed during the attack Reporters were banned from witnessing the attack, near the neutral zone that touches the border between Saudi Arabia and Iraq [305] Every American in the assault was inside an armored vehicle [305]\n\n\nPalestinian exodus from Kuwait\nA Palestinian exodus from Kuwait took place during and after the Gulf War During the Gulf War, more than 200,000 Palestinians fled Kuwait during the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait due to harassment and intimidation by Iraqi security forces, [309] in addition to getting fired from work by Iraqi authority figures in Kuwait [309] After the Gulf War, the Kuwaiti authorities forcibly pressured nearly 200,000 Palestinians to leave Kuwait in 1991 [309] Kuwait's policy, which led to this exodus, was a response to alignment of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and the PLO with Saddam Hussein.\n\n\nCoalition bombing of Iraq's civilian infrastructure\nIn the 23 June 1991 edition of The Washington Post, reporter Bart Gellman wrote: \n\n\nAbuse of Coalition POWs\nDuring the conflict, coalition aircrew shot down over Iraq were displayed as prisoners of war on TV, most with visible signs of abuse Amongst several testimonies to poor treatment, [317] USAF Captain Richard Storr was allegedly tortured by Iraqis during the Persian Gulf War Iraqi secret police broke his nose, dislocated his shoulder and punctured his eardrum [318] Royal Air Force Tornado crew John Nichol and John Peters have both alleged that they were tortured during this time [319] [320] Nichol and Peters were forced to make statements against the war on television Members of British Special Air Service Bravo Two Zero were captured while providing information about an Iraqi supply line of Scud missiles to coalition forces Only one, Chris Ryan, evaded capture while the group's other surviving members were violently tortured [321] Flight surgeon (later General) Rhonda Cornum was sexually assaulted by one of her captors [322] after the Black Hawk helicopter in which she was riding was shot down while searching for a downed F-16 pilot [citation needed]\n\n\nOperation Southern Watch\nSince the war, the US has had a continued presence of 5,000 troops stationed in Saudi Arabia – a figure that rose to 10,000 during the 2003 conflict in Iraq [323] Operation Southern Watch enforced the no-fly zones over southern Iraq set up after 1991; oil exports through the Persian Gulf's shipping lanes were protected by the Bahrain-based US Fifth Fleet [citation needed]\n\n\nSanctions\nOn 6 August 1990, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 661 which imposed economic sanctions on Iraq, providing for a full trade embargo, excluding medical supplies, food and other items of humanitarian necessity, these to be determined by the council's sanctions committee From 1991 until 2003, the effects of government policy and sanctions regime led to hyperinflation, widespread poverty and malnutrition [citation needed]\n\n\nDraining of the Qurna Marshes\nThe draining of the Qurna Marshes was an irrigation project in Iraq during and immediately after the war, to drain a large area of marshes in the Tigris–Euphrates river system Formerly covering an area of around 3,000 km2 (1,200 sq mi), the large complex of wetlands were nearly emptied of water, and the local Shi'ite population relocated, following the war and 1991 uprisings By 2000, the United Nations Environment Programme estimated that 90% of the marshlands had disappeared, causing desertification of over 7,500 square miles (19,000 km2) [citation needed]\n\n\nOil spill\nOn 23 January, Iraq dumped 400 million US gallons (1,500,000 m3) of crude oil into the Persian Gulf, [333] causing the largest offshore oil spill in history at that time [332] It was reported as a deliberate natural resources attack to keep US Marines from coming ashore (Missouri and Wisconsin had shelled Failaka Island during the war to reinforce the idea that there would be an amphibious assault attempt) [334] About 30–40% of this came from allied raids on Iraqi coastal targets [335]\n\n\nKuwaiti oil fires\nThe Kuwaiti oil fires were caused by the Iraqi military setting fire to 700 oil wells as part of a scorched earth policy while retreating from Kuwait in 1991 after conquering the country but being driven out by coalition forces The fires started in January and February 1991, and the last one was extinguished by November [336]\n\n\nCost\nThe cost of the war to the United States was calculated by the US Congress in April 1992 to be $61.1 billion [338] (equivalent to $119 billion in 2023) [339] About $52 billion of that amount was paid by other countries: $36 billion by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Arab states of the Persian Gulf; $16 billion by Germany and Japan (which sent no combat forces due to their constitutions) About 25% of Saudi Arabia's contribution was paid with in-kind services to the troops, such as food and transportation [338] US troops represented about 74% of the combined force, and the global cost was therefore higher [citation needed]\n\n\nEffect on developing countries\nApart from the impact on Arab States of the Persian Gulf, the resulting economic disruptions after the crisis affected many states The Overseas Development Institute (ODI) undertook a study in 1991 to assess the effects on developing states and the international community's response A briefing paper finalized on the day that the conflict ended draws on their findings which had two main conclusions: Many developing states were severely affected and while there has been a considerable response to the crisis, the distribution of assistance was highly selective [340]\n\n\nMedia coverage\nUS policy regarding media freedom was much more restrictive than in the Vietnam War [342] The policy had been spelled out in a Pentagon document entitled Annex Foxtrot Most of the press information came from briefings organized by the military Only selected journalists were allowed to visit the front lines or conduct interviews with soldiers Those visits were always conducted in the presence of officers, and were subject to both prior approval by the military and censorship afterward This was ostensibly to protect sensitive information from being revealed to Iraq This policy was heavily influenced by the military's experience with the Vietnam War, in which public opposition within the US grew throughout the war's course It was not only the limitation of information in the Middle East; media were also restricting what was shown about the war with more graphic depictions like Ken Jarecke's image of a burnt Iraqi soldier being pulled from the American AP wire whereas in Europe it was given extensive coverage [343] [344] [345]\n\n\nTechnology\nPrecision-guided munitions were heralded as key in allowing military strikes to be made with a minimum of civilian casualties compared to previous wars, although they were not used as often as more traditional, less accurate bombs Specific buildings in downtown Baghdad could be bombed while journalists in their hotels watched cruise missiles fly by [citation needed]\n\n\nScud and Patriot missiles\nThe role of Iraq's Scud missiles featured prominently in the war Scud is a tactical ballistic missile that the Soviet Union developed and deployed among the forward deployed Soviet Army divisions in East Germany [citation needed]\n\n\nPopular culture\nThe Gulf War has been the subject of several video games including Conflict: Desert Storm, Conflict: Desert Storm II, Gulf War: Operation Desert Hammer, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 There have also been numerous depictions in film including Jarhead (2005), which is based on US Marine Anthony Swofford's 2003 memoir of the same name [359] The 2016 Bollywood movie Airlift is based on 1990 airlift of Indians from Kuwait, the evacuation of Indian citizens stranded in Kuwait during the Gulf War

the Second Gulf War or the Iraq War, was a military conflict that took place from 1990 to 1991. The war was fought between Iraq, led by Saddam Hussein, and a coalition of 34 countries led by the United States. The conflict began when Iraq, under the pretext of a dispute over border demarcations, invaded neighboring Kuwait on August 2, 1990.\n\n**Names**\n\nThe war is also known under other names, such as the Second Gulf War (not to be confused with the 2003 Iraq War, also referred to as such), Persian Gulf War, Kuwait War, First Iraq War, or Iraq War. The war was named \"Umm al-Ma'arik\" (\"mother of all battles\") by Iraqi officials. After the U.S invasion of Iraq in 2003, the Gulf War of 1990-1991 is often known as the \"First Iraq War\".\n\n**Operational Names**\n\nMost of the coalition states used various names for their operations and the war's operational phases. These are sometimes incorrectly used as the conflict's overall name, especially the U.S Desert Storm. The U.S Department of Defense also used the term \"Desert Shield\" to refer to the war's pre-invasion phase.\n\n**Campaign Names**\n\nThe U.S divided the conflict into three major campaigns: Operation Desert Shield, Operation Desert Storm, and Operation Desert Saber.\n\n**Background**\n\nThroughout the Cold War, Iraq had been an ally of the Soviet Union, and there was a history of friction between Iraq and the United States. The U.S was concerned with Iraq's position on Israeli-Palestinian politics. The U.S also disliked Iraqi support for Palestinian militant groups, which led to Iraq's inclusion on the developing U.S list of State Sponsors of Terrorism in December 1979.\n\n**Invasion of Kuwait**\n\nThe result of the Jeddah talks was an Iraqi demand for $10 billion to cover the lost revenues from Rumaila; Kuwait offered $500 million. The Iraqi response was to immediately order an invasion, which started on 2 August 1990 with the bombing of Kuwait's capital, Kuwait City.\n\n**Kuwaiti Resistance Movement**\n\nKuwaitis founded a local armed resistance movement following the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. The Kuwaiti resistance's casualty rate far exceeded that of the coalition military forces and Western hostages. The resistance predominantly consisted of ordinary citizens who lacked any form of training and supervision.\n\n**Run-up to the War**\n\nA key element of U.S political, military and energy economic planning occurred in early 1984. The Iran-Iraq war had been going on for five years by that time and both sides sustained significant casualties, reaching into the hundreds of thousands. Within President Ronald Reagan's National Security Council concern was growing that the war could spread beyond the boundaries of the two belligerents. A National Security Planning Group meeting was formed, chaired by then Vice President George H W Bush, to review U.S options. It was determined that the conflict would likely spread into Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states, but that the United States had little capability to defend the region. Furthermore, it was determined that a prolonged war in the region would induce much higher oil prices and threaten the fragile recovery of the world economy, which was just beginning to gain momentum.\n\n**Diplomatic Means**\n\nThe U.S and other Western countries made several diplomatic efforts to try and resolve the conflict peacefully. The U.S Secretary of State James Baker met with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz in Geneva on 9 August 1990, but the talks broke down without an agreement. The U.N Security Council passed Resolution 660 on 2 August 1990, which condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and demanded that it withdraw its troops. However, Iraq refused to comply with the resolution.\n\n**Military Means**\n\nThe U.S and coalition forces began mobilizing in August 1990. The U.S deployed troops to Saudi Arabia, where they were stationed in a series of camps and bases. The coalition also began to blockade Iraq's borders and ports, cutting off its supply of oil and other goods.\n\n**Creating a Coalition**\n\nA series of U.N Security Council resolutions and Arab League resolutions were passed regarding Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Resolution 678, passed on 29 November 1990, gave Iraq a withdrawal deadline until 15 January 1991 and authorized \"all necessary means to uphold and implement Resolution 660\", and a diplomatic formulation authorizing the use of force if Iraq failed to comply.\n\n**Justification for Intervention**\n\nThe U.S and the U.N gave several public justifications for involvement in the conflict, the most prominent being the Iraqi violation of Kuwaiti territorial integrity. In addition, the U.S moved to support its ally Saudi Arabia, whose importance in the region, and as a key supplier of oil, made it of considerable geopolitical importance.\n\n**Public Relations Campaign**\n\nThe U.S military conducted a public relations campaign to try and boost support for the war. The U.S Department of Defense issued a statement saying that the coalition was acting in self-defense and that the war was necessary to protect Kuwait's sovereignty. The U.S also conducted a series of press briefings and other public relations activities to try and build support for the war.\n\n**Air Campaign**\n\nThe Gulf War began with an extensive aerial bombing campaign on 17 January 1991. For 42 consecutive days and nights, the coalition forces subjected Iraq to one of the most intensive air bombardments in military history. The coalition flew over 100,000 sorties, dropping 88,500 tonnes of bombs, which widely destroyed military and civilian infrastructure.\n\n**Ground Campaign**\n\nA 90,000 round artillery preparation fire on Iraqi defensive positions preceded the major ground assault, lasting 2.5 hours. The ground campaign consisted of three or possibly four of the largest tank battles in American military history. The battles at 73 Easting, Norfolk, and Medina Ridge are well noted for their historical significance. Other sources consider the Battle of Norfolk the largest tank battle of the war and the second largest tank battle in American history.\n\n**Liberation of Kuwait**\n\nUS decoy attacks by air attacks and naval gunfire the night before Kuwait's liberation were designed to make the Iraqis believe the main coalition ground attack would focus on central Kuwait. For months, American units in Saudi Arabia had been under almost constant Iraqi artillery fire, as well as threats from Scud missiles and chemical attacks. On 24 February 1991, the 1st and 2nd Marine Divisions and the 1st Light Armored Infantry Battalion crossed into Kuwait and headed toward Kuwait City. They encountered trenches, barbed wire, and minefields, but these positions were poorly defended, and were overrun in the first few hours.\n\n**Initial Moves into Iraq**\n\nThe war's ground phase was officially designated Operation Desert Saber. The first units to move into Iraq were three patrols of the British Special Air Service's B squadron, call signs Bravo One Zero, Bravo Two Zero, and Bravo Three Zero, in late January. These eight-man patrols landed behind Iraqi lines to gather intelligence on the movements of Scud mobile missile launchers, which could not be detected from the air, as they were hidden under bridges and camouflage netting during the day.\n\n**Coalition Bombing of Iraq's Civilian Infrastructure**\n\nThe coalition forces conducted a series of bombing raids against Iraq's civilian infrastructure, including its power plants, water treatment facilities, and roads. The bombing campaign was designed to weaken Iraq's ability to wage war and to reduce its ability to support its civilians.\n\n**Highway of Death**\n\nIn the night of 26-27 February 1991, some Iraqi forces began leaving Kuwait on the main highway north of Al Jahra in a column of some 1,400 vehicles. A patrolling E-8 Joint STARS aircraft observed the retreating forces and relayed the information to the DDM-8 air operations center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. These vehicles and the retreating soldiers were subsequently attacked by two A-10 aircraft, resulting in a 60 kilometres (37 mi) stretch of highway strewn with debris—the Highway of Death.\n\n**Operation Southern Watch**\n\nSince the war, the U.S has had a continued presence of 5,000 troops stationed in Saudi Arabia, which rose to 10,000 during the 2003 conflict in Iraq. Operation Southern Watch enforced the no-fly zones over southern Iraq set up after 1991; oil exports through the Persian Gulf's shipping lanes were protected by the Bahrain-based U.S Fifth Fleet.\n\n**Sanctions**\n\nOn 6 August 1990, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the U.N Security Council adopted Resolution 661 which imposed economic sanctions on Iraq, providing for a full trade embargo, excluding medical supplies, food and other items of humanitarian necessity, these to be determined by the council's sanctions committee. From 1991 until 2003, the effects of government policy and sanctions regime led to hyperinflation, widespread poverty and malnutrition.\n\n**Draining of the Qurna Marshes**\n\nThe draining of the Qurna Marshes was an irrigation project in Iraq during and immediately after the war, to drain a large area of marshes in the Tigris-Euphrates river system. Formerly covering an area of around 3,000 km2 (1,200 sq mi), the large complex of wetlands were nearly emptied of water, and the local Shi'ite population relocated, following the war and 1991 uprisings. By 2000, the United Nations Environment Programme estimated that 90% of the marshlands had disappeared, causing desertification of over 7,500 square miles (19,000 km2).\n\n**Oil Spill**\n\nOn 23 January, Iraq dumped 400 million US gallons (1,500,000 m3) of crude oil into the Persian Gulf, causing the largest offshore oil spill in history at that time. It was reported as a deliberate natural resources attack to keep US Marines from coming ashore.\n\n**Kuwaiti Oil Fires**\n\nThe Kuwaiti oil fires were caused by the Iraqi military setting fire to 700 oil wells as part of a scorched earth policy while retreating from Kuwait in 1991 after conquering the country but being driven out by coalition forces. The fires started in January and February 1991, and the last one was extinguished by November.\n\n**Cost**\n\nThe cost of the war to the United States was calculated by the U.S Congress in April 1992 to be $61.1 billion, which is equivalent to $119 billion in 2023. About $52 billion of that amount was paid by other countries, including $36 billion by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab states of the Persian Gulf, and $16 billion by Germany and Japan.\n\n**Effect on Developing Countries**\n\nApart from the impact on Arab States of the Persian Gulf, the resulting economic disruptions after the crisis affected many states. The Overseas Development Institute (ODI) undertook a study in 1991 to assess the effects on developing states and the international community's response. A briefing paper finalized on the day that the conflict ended drew on their findings which had two main conclusions: Many developing states were severely affected and while there has been a considerable response to the crisis, the distribution of assistance was highly selective.\n\n**Media Coverage**\n\nUS policy regarding media freedom was much more restrictive than in the Vietnam War. The policy had been spelled out in a Pentagon document entitled Annex Foxtrot. Most of the press information came from briefings organized by the military. Only selected journalists were allowed to visit the front lines or conduct interviews with soldiers.\n\n**Technology**\n\nPrecision-guided munitions were heralded as key in allowing military strikes to be made with a minimum of civilian casualties compared to previous wars, although they were not used as often as more traditional, less accurate bombs. Specific buildings in downtown Baghdad could be bombed while journalists in their hotels watched cruise missiles fly by.\n\n**Scud and Patriot Missiles**\n\nThe role of Iraq's Scud missiles featured prominently in the war. Scud is a tactical ballistic missile that the Soviet Union developed and deployed among the forward deployed Soviet Army divisions in East Germany.\n\n**Popular Culture**\n\nThe Gulf War has been the subject of several video games, including Conflict: Desert Storm, Conflict: Desert Storm II, Gulf War: Operation Desert Hammer, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. There have also been numerous depictions in film, including Jarhead (2005), which is based on US Marine Anthony Swofford's 2003 memoir of the same name. The 2016 Bollywood movie Airlift is based on 1990 airlift of Indians from Kuwait, the evacuation of Indian citizens stranded in Kuwait during the Gulf War.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Gulf War syndrome\n*

the project conclusions in the Oval Office by William Flynn Martin who had served as the head of the NSC staff that organized the study (The full declassified presentation can be seen here: [79]) The conclusions were threefold: first, oil stocks needed to be increased among members of the International Energy Agency and, if necessary, released early if the oil market was disrupted; second, the United States needed to beef up the security of friendly Arab states in the region; and third, an embargo should be placed on sales of military equipment to Iran and Iraq The plan was approved by President Reagan and later affirmed by the G7 leaders headed by the United Kingdom's Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, in the London Summit of 1984 The plan was implemented and became the basis for

deadline until 15 January 1991 and authorized \"all necessary means to uphold and implement Resolution 660\", and a diplomatic formulation authorizing the use of force if Iraq failed to comply [107]\n\n\nJustification for intervention\nThe US and the UN gave several public justifications for involvement in the conflict, the most prominent being the Iraqi violation of Kuwaiti territorial integrity In addition, the US moved to support its ally Saudi Arabia, whose importance in the region, and as a key supplier of oil, made it of considerable geopolitical importance Shortly after the Iraqi invasion, US Defense Secretary Dick Cheney made the first of several visits to Saudi Arabia where King Fahd requested US military assistance During a speech in a special joint session of the US Congress given on 11 September 1990, Bush summed up the reasons with the following remarks: \"Within three days, 120,000 Iraqi troops with 850 tanks had poured into Kuwait and moved south to threaten Saudi Arabia It was then that I decided to act to check that aggression.\" [119]\n\n\nPublic relations campaign targeting the public\nAlthough the Iraqi military committed human rights abuses during the invasion, the alleged incidents that received the most publicity in the US were fabrications of the public relations firm hired by the government of Kuwait to persuade Americans to support military intervention [122] Shortly after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the organization Citizens for a Free Kuwait was formed in the US It hired the public relations firm Hill & Knowlton for about $11 million, paid by Kuwait's government [123]\n\n\nEarly battles\nThe Gulf War began with an extensive aerial bombing campaign on 16 January 1991 For 42 consecutive days and nights, the coalition

start, in the aftermath of the failed US–Iraq peace talks in Geneva, Switzerland, a reporter asked Iraq's English-speaking Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz: \"Mr Foreign Minister, if war starts .. will you attack Israel?\" His response was: \"Yes, absolutely, yes.\" [134] [135]\n\n\nIraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia (Battle of Khafji)\nOn 29 January, Iraqi forces attacked and occupied the lightly defended Saudi city of Khafji with tanks and infantry The Battle of Khafji ended two days later when the Iraqis were driven back by the Saudi Arabian National Guard, supported by Qatari forces and US Marines [151] The allied forces used extensive artillery fire [citation needed]\n\n\nCounter reconnaissance\nTask Force 1-41 Infantry was a US Army heavy battalion task force from the 2nd Armored Division (Forward) It was the spearhead of VII Corps, consisting primarily of the 1st Battalion, 41st Infantry Regiment, 3rd Battalion, 66th Armor Regiment, and the 4th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery Regiment Task Force 1–41 was the first coalition force to breach the Saudi Arabian border on 15 February 1991, and to conduct ground combat operations in Iraq engaging in direct and indirect fire fights with the enemy on 17 February 1991 [154] Shortly after arrival in theatre Task Force 1–41 Infantry received a counter-reconnaissance mission [155] 1–41 Infantry was assisted by the 1st Squadron, 4th Armored Cavalry Regiment This joint effort would become known as Task Force Iron [156] Counter-reconnaissance generally includes destroying or repelling the enemy's reconnaissance elements and denying their commander any observation of friendly forces On 15 February 1991 4th Battalion of the 3rd Field Artillery Regiment fired on a trailer and a few trucks in the Iraqi sector observing American forces [157]\n\n\nBreach\nTask Force 1–41 Infantry was the first coalition force to breach the Saudi Arabian border on 15 February 1991 and conduct ground combat operations in Iraq engaging in direct and indirect fire fights with the enemy on 17 February 1991 [154] Prior to this action the Task Force's primary fire support battalion, 4th Battalion of the 3rd Field Artillery Regiment, participated in a massive artillery preparation Around 300 guns from multiple countries participated in the artillery barrage Over 14,000 rounds were fired during these missions M270 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems contributed an additional 4,900 rockets fired at Iraqi targets [165] Iraq lost close to 22 artillery battalions during the initial stages of this barrage, [166] including the destruction of approximately 396 Iraqi artillery pieces [166]\n\n\nGround campaign\nA 90,000 round artillery preparation fire on Iraqi defensive positions preceded the major ground assault, lasting 2.5 hours [177] 1st Infantry Division Artillery, which included 4-3 FA battalion, was decisive during artillery combat operations performing multiple raids and fire missions These combat operations resulted in the destruction of 50 enemy tanks, 139 APCs, 30 air defense systems, 152 artillery pieces, 27 missile launchers, 108 mortars, and 548 wheeled vehicles, 61 trench lines and bunker positions, 92 dug in and open infantry targets, and 34 logistical sites [178] The ground campaign consisted of three or possibly four of the largest tank battles in American military history [179] [180] The battles at 73 Easting, Norfolk, and Medina Ridge are well noted for their historical significance [179] Some consider the Battle of Medina Ridge the largest tank battle of the war [154] [181] Other sources consider the Battle of Norfolk the largest tank battle of the war and the second largest tank battle in American history [181] The U.S Marine Corps also fought the biggest tank battle in its history at Kuwait International Airport [180] The U.S 3rd Armored Division also fought a significant battle at Objective Dorset not far from where the Battle of Norfolk was taking place The U.S 3rd Armored Division destroyed approximately 300 enemy combat vehicles during this particular encounter with Iraqi forces [154]\n\n\nLiberation of Kuwait\nUS decoy attacks by air attacks and naval gunfire the night before Kuwait's liberation were designed to make the Iraqis believe the main coalition ground attack would focus on central Kuwait [citation needed] For months, American units in Saudi Arabia had been under almost constant Iraqi artillery fire, as well as threats from Scud missiles and chemical attacks On 24 February 1991, the 1st and 2nd Marine Divisions and the 1st Light Armored Infantry Battalion crossed into Kuwait and headed toward Kuwait City They encountered trenches, barbed wire, and minefields However, these positions were poorly defended, and were overrun in the first few hours Several tank battles took place, but otherwise coalition troops encountered minimal resistance, as most Iraqi troops surrendered The general pattern was that the Iraqis would put up a short fight before surrendering However, Iraqi air defenses shot down nine US aircraft Meanwhile, forces from Arab states advanced into Kuwait from the east, encountering little resistance and suffering few casualties [citation needed]\n\n\nInitial moves into Iraq\nThe war's ground phase was officially designated Operation Desert Saber [citation needed] The first units to move into Iraq were three patrols of the British Special Air Service's B squadron, call signs Bravo One Zero, Bravo Two Zero, and Bravo Three Zero, in late January These eight-man patrols landed behind Iraqi lines to gather intelligence on the movements of Scud mobile missile launchers, which could not be detected from the air, as they were hidden under bridges and camouflage netting during the day [228] Other objectives included the destruction of the launchers and their fiber-optic communications arrays that lay in pipelines and relayed coordinates to the TEL operators launching attacks against Israel The operations were designed to prevent any possible Israeli intervention Due to lack of sufficient ground cover to carry out their assignment, One Zero and Three Zero abandoned their operations, while Two Zero remained, and was later compromised, with only Sergeant Chris Ryan escaping to Syria [citation needed]\n\n\nCoalition forces enter Iraq\nShortly afterwards, the US VII Corps, in full strength and spearheaded by the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment, launched an armored attack into Iraq early on 24 February, just to the west of Kuwait, surprising Iraqi forces Simultaneously, the US XVIII Airborne Corps launched a sweeping \"left-hook\" attack across southern Iraq's largely undefended desert, led by the US 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment and the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) This movement's left flank was protected by the French Division Daguet The 101st Airborne Division conducted a combat air assault into enemy territory [229] The 101st Airborne Division had struck 249 km (155 mi) behind enemy lines [229] It was the deepest air assault operation in history [229] Approximately 400 helicopters transported 2,000 soldiers into Iraq where they destroyed Iraqi columns trying to flee westward and prevented the escape of Iraqi forces [231] The 101st Airborne Division travelled a further 80 to 100 km (50 to 60 mi) into Iraq [229] By nightfall, the 101st cut off Highway 8 which was a vital supply line running between Basra and the Iraqi forces [229] The 101st had lost 16 soldiers in action during the 100-hour war and captured thousands of enemy prisoners of war [citation needed]\n\n\nEnd of active hostilities\nIn coalition-occupied Iraqi territory, a peace conference was held where a ceasefire agreement was negotiated and signed by both sides At the conference, Iraq was authorized to fly armed helicopters on their side of the temporary border, ostensibly for government transit due to the damage done to civilian infrastructure Soon after, these helicopters and much of Iraq's military were used to fight an uprising in the south On March 1, 1991, one day after the Gulf War ceasefire, a revolt broke out in Basra against the Iraqi government The uprising spread within days to all of the largest Shia cities in southern Iraq: Najaf, Amarah, Diwaniya, Hilla, Karbala, Kut, Nasiriyah and Samawah The rebellions were encouraged by an airing of \"The Voice of Free Iraq\" on 24 February 1991, which was broadcast from a CIA-run radio station out of Saudi Arabia The Arabic service of the Voice of America supported the uprising by stating that the rebellion was well supported, and that they would soon be liberated from Saddam [234]\n\n\nCoalition involvement\nCoalition members included Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, [241] Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Honduras, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Kuwait, Luxembourg, Morocco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Niger, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, [242] Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Syria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States [243] The United States had 700,000 troops [244] [245]\n\n\nAustralia\nAustralia contributed a Naval Task Group, which formed part of the multi-national fleet in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, under Operation Damask In addition, medical teams were deployed aboard a US hospital ship, and a naval clearance diving team took part in de-mining Kuwait's port facilities following the end of combat operations Australian forces experienced a number of incidents in the first number of weeks of the Desert Storm Campaign including the detection of significant air threats from Iraq as a part of the outer perimeter of Battle Force Zulu; the detection of free sea floating mines and assistance to the aircraft carrier USS Midway The Australian Task Force was also placed at great risk with regard to the sea mine threat, with HMAS Brisbane narrowly avoiding a mine The Australians played a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against Iraq following Kuwait's invasion Following the war's end, Australia deployed a medical unit on Operation Habitat to northern Iraq as part of Operation Provide Comfort [247]\n\n\nArgentina\nArgentina was the only South American country to participate in the 1991 Gulf War It sent a destroyer, ARA Almirante Brown (D-10), a corvette, ARA Spiro (P-43) (later replaced by another corvette, ARA Rosales (P-42)) and a supply ship, ARA Bahía San Blas (B-4) to participate on the United Nations blockade and sea control effort of the Persian Gulf The success of \"Operación Alfil\" (English: \"Operation Bishop\") with more than 700 interceptions and 25,000 nautical miles (46,000 km) sailed in the theatre of operations helped to overcome the so-called \"Malvinas syndrome\" [248]\n\n\nCanada\nCanada was one of the first countries to condemn Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and it quickly agreed to join the US-led coalition In August 1990, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney committed the Canadian Forces to deploy a Naval Task Group The destroyers HMCS Terra Nova and HMCS Athabaskan joined the maritime interdiction force supported by the supply ship HMCS Protecteur in Operation Friction The Canadian Task Group led the coalition's maritime logistics forces in the Persian Gulf A fourth ship, HMCS Huron, arrived in-theater after hostilities had ceased and was the first allied ship to visit Kuwait [citation needed]\n\n\nFrance\nThe second largest European contingent was from France, which committed 18,000 troops [243] Operating on the left flank of the US XVIII Airborne Corps, the French Army force was the Division Daguet, including troops from the French Foreign Legion Initially, the French operated independently under national command and control, but coordinated closely with the Americans (via CENTCOM) and Saudis In January, the Division was placed under the tactical control of the XVIII Airborne Corps France also deployed several combat aircraft and naval units The French called their contribution Opération Daguet [citation needed]\n\n\nItaly\nFollowing the invasion and annexation of Kuwait by Iraq, on September 25, 1990, the Italian Government sent eight multirole fighter bombers Tornado IDS (plus two spare) in the Persian Gulf, belonging to the 6º, 36º and 50º Stormo, which were deployed at the Al Dhafra Air Base, near Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates [251] [252] [253] During the 42 days of war, Italian fighters made 226 sorties for a total of 589 flight hours The Italian Air Force recorded the loss of a single aircraft in the Gulf War The use of Italian aircraft as part of the Desert Storm operation represented the first operational employment in combat missions of Italian Air Force aircraft since the end of World War II [citation needed]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nThe United Kingdom committed the largest contingent of any European state that participated in the war's combat operations Operation Granby was the code name for the operations in the Persian Gulf British Army regiments (mainly with the 1st Armoured Division), Royal Air Force, Naval Air Squadrons and Royal Navy vessels were mobilized in the Persian Gulf Both Royal Air Force and Naval Air Squadrons, using various aircraft, operated from airbases in Saudi Arabia and Naval Air Squadrons from various vessels in the Persian Gulf The United Kingdom played a major role in the Battle of Norfolk, where its forces destroyed over 200 Iraqi tanks and a large quantity of other vehicles [208] [209] After 48 hours of combat the British 1st Armoured Division destroyed or isolated four Iraqi infantry divisions (the 26th, 48th, 31st, and 25th) and overran the Iraqi 52nd Armored Division in several sharp engagements [209]\n\n\nCasualties\nOver 1,000 Kuwaiti civilians were killed by Iraqis [256] More than 600 Kuwaitis went missing during Iraq's occupation, [257] and approximately 375 remains were found in mass graves in Iraq The increased importance of air attacks from both coalition warplanes and cruise missiles led to controversy over the number of civilian deaths caused during Desert Storm's initial stages Within Desert Storm's first 24 hours, more than 1,000 sorties were flown, many against targets in Baghdad The city was the target of heavy bombing, as it was the seat of power for Saddam and the Iraqi forces' command and control This ultimately led to civilian casualties [citation needed]\n\n\nCivilian\nOver 1,000 Kuwaiti civilians were killed by Iraqis [256] More than 600 Kuwaitis went missing during Iraq's occupation, [257] and approximately 375 remains were found in mass graves in Iraq The increased importance of air attacks from both coalition warplanes and cruise missiles led to controversy over the number of civilian deaths caused during Desert Storm's initial stages Within Desert Storm's first 24 hours, more than 1,000 sorties were flown, many against targets in Baghdad The city was the target of heavy bombing, as it was the seat of power for Saddam and the Iraqi forces' command and control This ultimately led to civilian casualties [citation needed]\n\n\nIraqi\nA United Nations report in March 1991 described the effect on Iraq of the US-led bombing campaign as \"near apocalyptic\", bringing back Iraq to the \"pre-industrial age.\" [268] The exact number of Iraqi combat casualties is unknown, but is believed to have been heavy Some estimate that Iraq sustained between 20,000 and 35,000 fatalities [262] A report commissioned by the US Air Force estimated 10,000–12,000 Iraqi combat deaths in the air campaign, and as many as 10,000 casualties in the ground war [269] This analysis is based on Iraqi prisoner of war reports [citation needed]\n\n\nCoalition\nThe US Department of Defense reports that US forces suffered 148 battle-related deaths (35 to friendly fire [285]), with one pilot listed as MIA (his remains were found and identified in August 2009) A further 145 Americans died in non-combat accidents [272] The UK suffered 47 deaths (nine to friendly fire, all by US forces), France nine, [272] and the other countries, not including Kuwait, suffered 37 deaths (18 Saudis, one Egyptian, six UAE and three Qataris) [272] At least 605 Kuwaiti soldiers were still missing 10 years after their capture [286]\n\n\nFriendly fire\nWhile the death toll among coalition forces engaging Iraqi combatants was very low, a substantial number of deaths were caused by accidental attacks from other Allied units Of the 148 US troops who died in battle, 24% were killed by friendly fire, a total of 35 service personnel [290] A further 11 died in detonations of coalition munitions Nine British military personnel were killed in a friendly fire incident when a USAF A-10 Thunderbolt II destroyed a group of two Warrior IFVs [citation needed]\n\n\nAftermath\nMany returning coalition soldiers reported illnesses following their action in the war, a phenomenon known as Gulf War syndrome (GWS) or Gulf War illness (GWI) Common symptoms reported are chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, and gastrointestinal disorder [291] There has been widespread speculation and disagreement about the causes of the illness and the possibly related birth defects Researchers found that infants born to male veterans of the 1991 war had higher rates of two types of heart valve defects Some children born after the war to Gulf War veterans had a certain kidney defect that was not found in Gulf War veterans' children born before the war Researchers have said that they did not have enough information to link birth defects with exposure to toxic substances [292]\n\n\nGulf War illness\nMany returning coalition soldiers reported illnesses following their action in the war, a phenomenon known as Gulf War syndrome (GWS) or Gulf War illness (GWI) Common symptoms reported are chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, and gastrointestinal disorder [291] There has been widespread speculation and disagreement about the causes of the illness and the possibly related birth defects Researchers found that infants born to male veterans of the 1991 war had higher rates of two types of heart valve defects Some children born after the war to Gulf War veterans had a certain kidney defect that was not found in Gulf War veterans' children born before the war Researchers have said that they did not have enough information to link birth defects with exposure to toxic substances [292]\n\n\nEffects of depleted uranium\nThe US military used depleted uranium in tank kinetic energy penetrators and 20–30 mm (0.79–1.18 in) cannon ordnance Significant controversy regarding the long term safety of depleted uranium exists, including claims of pyrophoric, genotoxic, and teratogenic heavy metal effects Many have cited its use during the war as a contributing factor to a number of major health issues in veterans and in surrounding civilian populations, including in birth defects and child cancer rates Scientific opinion on the risk is mixed [294] [295] [296] In 2004, Iraq had the highest mortality rate due to leukemia of any country [297] [298] [299] [300]\n\n\nHighway of Death\nIn the night of 26–27 February 1991, some Iraqi forces began leaving Kuwait on the main highway north of Al Jahra in a column of some 1,400 vehicles A patrolling E-8 Joint STARS aircraft observed the retreating forces and relayed the information to the DDM-8 air operations center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [citation needed] These vehicles and the retreating soldiers were subsequently attacked by two A-10 aircraft, resulting in a 60 kilometres (37 mi) stretch of highway strewn with debris—the Highway of Death New York Times reporter Maureen Dowd wrote, \"With the Iraqi leader facing military defeat, Mr Bush decided that he would rather gamble on a violent and potentially unpopular ground war than risk the alternative: an imperfect settlement hammered out by the Soviets and Iraqis that world opinion might accept as tolerable.\" [303]\n\n\nBulldozer assault\nAnother incident during the war highlighted the question of large-scale Iraqi combat deaths This was the \"bulldozer assault\", wherein two brigades from the US 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized) were faced with a large and complex trench network, as part of the heavily fortified \"Saddam Hussein Line\" After some deliberation, they opted to use anti-mine plows mounted on tanks and combat earthmovers to simply plow over and bury alive the defending Iraqi soldiers Not a single American was killed during the attack Reporters were banned from witnessing the attack, near the neutral zone that touches the border between Saudi Arabia and Iraq [305] Every American in the assault was inside an armored vehicle [305]\n\n\nPalestinian exodus from Kuwait\nA Palestinian exodus from Kuwait took place during and after the Gulf War During the Gulf War, more than 200,000 Palestinians fled Kuwait during the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait due to harassment and intimidation by Iraqi security forces, [309] in addition to getting fired from work by Iraqi authority figures in Kuwait [309] After the Gulf War, the Kuwaiti authorities forcibly pressured nearly 200,000 Palestinians to leave Kuwait in 1991 [309] Kuwait's policy, which led to this exodus, was a response to alignment of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and the PLO with Saddam Hussein.\n\n\nCoalition bombing of Iraq's civilian infrastructure\nIn the 23 June 1991 edition of The Washington Post, reporter Bart Gellman wrote: \n\n\nAbuse of Coalition POWs\nDuring the conflict, coalition aircrew shot down over Iraq were displayed as prisoners of war on TV, most with visible signs of abuse Amongst several testimonies to poor treatment, [317] USAF Captain Richard Storr was allegedly tortured by Iraqis during the Persian Gulf War Iraqi secret police broke his nose, dislocated his shoulder and punctured his eardrum [318] Royal Air Force Tornado crew John Nichol and John Peters have both alleged that they were tortured during this time [319] [320] Nichol and Peters were forced to make statements against the war on television Members of British Special Air Service Bravo Two Zero were captured while providing information about an Iraqi supply line of Scud missiles to coalition forces Only one, Chris Ryan, evaded capture while the group's other surviving members were violently tortured [321] Flight surgeon (later General) Rhonda Cornum was sexually assaulted by one of her captors [322] after the Black Hawk helicopter in which she was riding was shot down while searching for a downed F-16 pilot [citation needed]\n\n\nOperation Southern Watch\nSince the war, the US has had a continued presence of 5,000 troops stationed in Saudi Arabia – a figure that rose to 10,000 during the 2003 conflict in Iraq [323] Operation Southern Watch enforced the no-fly zones over southern Iraq set up after 1991; oil exports through the Persian Gulf's shipping lanes were protected by the Bahrain-based US Fifth Fleet [citation needed]\n\n\nSanctions\nOn 6 August 1990, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 661 which imposed economic sanctions on Iraq, providing for a full trade embargo, excluding medical supplies, food and other items of humanitarian necessity, these to be determined by the council's sanctions committee From 1991 until 2003, the effects of government policy and sanctions regime led to hyperinflation, widespread poverty and malnutrition [citation needed]\n\n\nDraining of the Qurna Marshes\nThe draining of the Qurna Marshes was an irrigation project in Iraq during and immediately after the war, to drain a large area of marshes in the Tigris–Euphrates river system Formerly covering an area of around 3,000 km2 (1,200 sq mi), the large complex of wetlands were nearly emptied of water, and the local Shi'ite population relocated, following the war and 1991 uprisings By 2000, the United Nations Environment Programme estimated that 90% of the marshlands had disappeared, causing desertification of over 7,500 square miles (19,000 km2) [citation needed]\n\n\nOil spill\nOn 23 January, Iraq dumped 400 million US gallons (1,500,000 m3) of crude oil into the Persian Gulf, [333] causing the largest offshore oil spill in history at that time [332] It was reported as a deliberate natural resources attack to keep US Marines from coming ashore (Missouri and Wisconsin had shelled Failaka Island during the war to reinforce the idea that there would be an amphibious assault attempt) [334] About 30–40% of this came from allied raids on Iraqi coastal targets [335]\n\n\nKuwaiti oil fires\nThe Kuwaiti oil fires were caused by the Iraqi military setting fire to 700 oil wells as part of a scorched earth policy while retreating from Kuwait in 1991 after conquering the country but being driven out by coalition forces The fires started in January and February 1991, and the last one was extinguished by November [336]\n\n\nCost\nThe cost of the war to the United States was calculated by the US Congress in April 1992 to be $61.1 billion [338] (equivalent to $119 billion in 2023) [339] About $52 billion of that amount was paid by other countries: $36 billion by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Arab states of the Persian Gulf; $16 billion by Germany and Japan (which sent no combat forces due to their constitutions) About 25% of Saudi Arabia's contribution was paid with in-kind services to the troops, such as food and transportation [338] US troops represented about 74% of the combined force, and the global cost was therefore higher [citation needed]\n\n\nEffect on developing countries\nApart from the impact on Arab States of the Persian Gulf, the resulting economic disruptions after the crisis affected many states The Overseas Development Institute (ODI) undertook a study in 1991 to assess the effects on developing states and the international community's response A briefing paper finalized on the day that the conflict ended draws on their findings which had two main conclusions: Many developing states were severely affected and while there has been a considerable response to the crisis, the distribution of assistance was highly selective [340]\n\n\nMedia coverage\nUS policy regarding media freedom was much more restrictive than in the Vietnam War [342] The policy had been spelled out in a Pentagon document entitled Annex Foxtrot Most of the press information came from briefings organized by the military Only selected journalists were allowed to visit the front lines or conduct interviews with soldiers Those visits were always conducted in the presence of officers, and were subject to both prior approval by the military and censorship afterward This was ostensibly to protect sensitive information from being revealed to Iraq This policy was heavily influenced by the military's experience with the Vietnam War, in which public opposition within the US grew throughout the war's course It was not only the limitation of information in the Middle East; media were also restricting what was shown about the war with more graphic depictions like Ken Jarecke's image of a burnt Iraqi soldier being pulled from the American AP wire whereas in Europe it was given extensive coverage [343] [344] [345]\n\n\nTechnology\nPrecision-guided munitions were heralded as key in allowing military strikes to be made with a minimum of civilian casualties compared to previous wars, although they were not used as often as more traditional, less accurate bombs Specific buildings in downtown Baghdad could be bombed while journalists in their hotels watched cruise missiles fly by [citation needed]\n\n\nScud and Patriot missiles\nThe role of Iraq's Scud missiles featured prominently in the war Scud is a tactical ballistic missile that the Soviet Union developed and deployed among the forward deployed Soviet Army divisions in East Germany [citation needed]\n\n\nPopular culture\nThe Gulf War has been the subject of several video games including Conflict: Desert Storm, Conflict: Desert Storm II, Gulf War: Operation Desert Hammer, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 There have also been numerous depictions in film including Jarhead (2005), which is based on US Marine Anthony Swofford's 2003 memoir of the same name [359] The 2016 Bollywood movie Airlift is based on 1990 airlift of Indians from Kuwait, the evacuation of Indian citizens stranded in Kuwait during the Gulf War

This article will explore the origins of the word, its transformation from a neutral term to a pejorative one, and its current usage in the context of sexuality and identity.\n\n**History**\n\nThe word \"gay\" arrived in English during the 12th century from Old French \"gai\", most likely deriving ultimately from a Germanic source. Initially, the term had a neutral meaning, conveying a sense of carefree joy or lightheartedness. It was not until the 14th century that the word began to acquire associations with sexual immorality, and by the 17th century, it had developed the specific meaning of \"addicted to pleasures and dissipations\".\n\n**Sexualization**\n\nThe word \"gay\" may have started to acquire associations of sexual immorality as early as the 14th century, but had certainly acquired them by the 17th. By the late 17th century, it had acquired the specific meaning of \"addicted to pleasures and dissipations\", an extension of its primary meaning of \"carefree\" implying \"uninhibited by moral constraints\". A gay woman was a prostitute, a gay man a womanizer, and a gay house a brothel. An example of this usage can be seen in a letter read to a London court in 1885 during the prosecution of brothel madam and procuress Mary Jeffries, which had been written by a girl while enslaved inside of a French brothel.\n\n**Shift to specifically homosexual**\n\nBy the mid-20th century, \"gay\" was well established in reference to hedonistic and uninhibited lifestyles, and its antonym \"straight\" had now acquired specific connotations of heterosexuality. In the case of \"gay\", other connotations of frivolousness and showiness in dress (\"gay apparel\") led to association with camp and effeminacy. This association no doubt helped the gradual narrowing in scope of the term towards its current dominant meaning, which was at first confined to subcultures. \"Gay\" was the preferred term since other terms, such as \"queer\", were felt to be derogatory. \"Homosexual\" was perceived as excessively clinical, since the sexual orientation now commonly referred to as \"homosexuality\" was at that time a mental illness diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM).\n\n**Homosexuality**\n\nThe American Psychological Association defines sexual orientation as \"an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions to men, women, or both sexes\", ranging \"along a continuum, from exclusive attraction to the other sex to exclusive attraction to the same sex\". Sexual orientation can also be \"discussed in terms of three categories: heterosexual (having emotional, romantic, or sexual attractions to members of the other sex), gay/lesbian (having emotional, romantic, or sexual attractions to members of one's own sex), and bisexual (having emotional, romantic, or sexual attractions to both men and women)\".\n\n**Sexual orientation, identity, behavior**\n\nThe American Psychological Association defines sexual orientation as \"an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions to men, women, or both sexes\", ranging \"along a continuum, from exclusive attraction to the other sex to exclusive attraction to the same sex\". Sexual orientation can also be \"discussed in terms of three categories: heterosexual (having emotional, romantic, or sexual attractions to members of the other sex), gay/lesbian (having emotional, romantic, or sexual attractions to members of one's own sex), and bisexual (having emotional, romantic, or sexual attractions to both men and women)\".\n\n**Terminology**\n\nSome reject the term \"homosexual\" as an identity-label because they find it too clinical-sounding; they believe it is too focused on physical acts rather than romance or attraction, or too reminiscent of the era when homosexuality was considered a mental illness. Conversely, some reject the term \"gay\" as an identity-label because they perceive the cultural connotations to be undesirable or because of the negative connotations of the slang usage of the word.\n\n**Gay community vs. LGBT community**\n\nStarting in the mid-1980s in the United States, a conscious effort was underway within what was then commonly called the gay community, to add the term \"lesbian\" to the name of organizations that involved both male and female homosexuals, and to use the terminology of \"gay and lesbian\", \"lesbian/gay\", or a similar phrase when referring to that community. Organizations such as the National Gay Task Force became the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. For many feminist lesbians, it was also important that \"lesbian\" be named first, to avoid the implication that women were secondary to men, or an afterthought. In the 1990s, this was followed by a similar effort to include terminology specifically including bisexual, transgender, intersex, and other people, reflecting the intra-community debate about the inclusion of these other sexual minorities as part of the same movement. Consequently, the portmanteau \"les/bi/gay\" has sometimes been used, and initialisms such as LGBTQ, LGBTQI, and others have come into common use by such organizations, and most news organizations have formally adopted some such variation.\n\n**Descriptor**\n\nThe term \"gay\" can also be used as an adjective to describe things related to homosexual men, or things which are part of the said culture. For example, the term \"gay bar\" describes the bar which either caters primarily to a homosexual male clientele or is otherwise part of homosexual male culture.\n\n**Use as a noun**\n\nThe label \"gay\" was originally used purely as an adjective (\"he is a gay man\" or \"he is gay\"). The term has also been in use as a noun with the meaning \"homosexual man\" since the 1970s, most commonly in the plural for an unspecified group, as in \"gays are opposed to that policy\". This usage is somewhat common in the names of organizations such as Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) and Children of Lesbians And Gays Everywhere (COLAGE). It is sometimes used to refer to individuals, as in \"he is a gay\" or \"two gays were there too\", although this may be perceived as derogatory. It was also used for comedic effect by the Little Britain character Dafydd Thomas. To avoid pejorative connotations, the adjective form can be used instead, e.g \"gay person\" or \"gay people\".\n\n**Generalized pejorative use**\n\nWhen used with a derisive attitude (e.g., \"that was so gay\"), the word \"gay\" is pejorative. Though retaining other meanings, its use among young people as a term of disparagement is common; 97 percent of American LGBTQ middle and high school students reported hearing its negative use as of 2021.\n\n**Parallels in other languages and cultures**\n\nThe term \"gay\" has similar meanings and connotations in many other languages and cultures, although the specific usage and evolution of the term may differ significantly. For example, in French, the equivalent term is \"gai\", which has a similar history and usage to the English term. In German, the term \"schwul\" is commonly used to refer to homosexual men, while \"lesbisch\" is used to refer to lesbian women. In Spanish, the term \"gay\" is increasingly being used to refer to both homosexual men and women.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Homosexuality\n* Queer\n* LGBTQ+\n* Sexual orientation\n* Identity\n* Behavior\n\n**References**\n\n* American Psychological Association.

{"title": "FIM-92_Stinger", "content": "\nDescription\nThe FIM-92 Stinger is a passive surface-to-air missile that can be shoulder-fired by a single operator (although standard military procedure calls for two operators –  team chief and gunner) [4] The Stinger was intended to supplant the FIM-43 Redeye system, the principal difference being that, unlike the Redeye, the Stinger can acquire the target from head-on, giving much more time to acquire and destroy the target The FIM-92B missile can also be fired from the M1097 Avenger and the M6 Linebacker The missile is also capable of being deployed from a Humvee Stinger rack and can be used by airborne troops A helicopter launched version exists and is called Air-to-Air Stinger (ATAS).\n\n\nHistory\nThe missile began as a program by General Dynamics to produce an improved variant of their 1967 FIM-43 Redeye Production of the Redeye ran from 1969 to 1982, with a total production of around 85,000 missiles The program was accepted for further development as Redeye II by the U.S Army in 1971 and designated FIM-92; the Stinger appellation was chosen in 1972 Because of technical difficulties that dogged testing, the first shoulder launch was not until mid-1975 Production of the FIM-92A began in 1978 An improved Stinger with a new seeker, the FIM-92B, was produced from 1983 alongside the FIM-92A Production of both the A and B types ended in 1987 with around 16,000 missiles produced.\n\n\nReplacement\nThe original Stinger's reprogrammable microprocessor has become obsolete in 2023, and a service life extension will keep the Block I in service until 2030 With the arsenal declining from obsolescence, on 10 November 2020 the U.S Army issued a request for information for a replacement MANPADS The new system will be compatible with the Stinger Vehicle Universal Launcher used on the IM-SHORAD and be able to defeat fixed and rotary-wing aircraft, as well as Group 2 and 3 UAS as well as or better than the Stinger A contract for up to 8,000 missiles is planned to be awarded by 2026 [7] [8] The request for information to interested firms only went out in April 2022, [9] and RTX and Lockheed Martin were selected to competitively develop the Stinger replacement in September 2023 [10]\n\n\nVariants\nThe Stinger's combat debut occurred during the Falklands War (Spanish: Guerra de las Malvinas) fought between the United Kingdom and Argentina At the onset of the conflict soldiers of the British Army's Special Air Service (SAS) had been clandestinely equipped with six missiles, although they had received little instruction in their use The sole SAS trooper who had received training on the system, and was due to train other troops, was killed in a helicopter crash on 19 May [19]\n\n\nService\nThe Stinger's

Afghanistan\nIn late 1985, several groups, such as Free the Eagle, began arguing the CIA was not doing enough to support the Mujahideen in the Soviet–Afghan War Michael Pillsbury, Vincent Cannistraro, and others put enormous bureaucratic pressure on the CIA to provide the Stinger to the rebels The idea was controversial because up to that point, the CIA had been operating with the pretense that the United States was not involved in the war directly, for various reasons All weapons supplied up to that point were non-U.S sourced weapons, including Kalashnikov style assault rifles made in China and Egypt [22]\n\n\nAngolan civil war\nThe Reagan administration provided 310 Stingers to Jonas Savimbi's UNITA movement in Angola between 1986 and 1989 [44] As in Afghanistan, efforts to recover missiles after the end of hostilities proved incomplete The battery of a Stinger lasts for four or five years, so any battery supplied in the 1980s would now be inoperative [45] but during the Syrian Civil War, insurgents showed how easily they switched to different batteries, including common car batteries, as power sources for several MANPADS models [46]\n\n\nLibyan invasion of Chad\nThe French army used 15 firing positions and 30 missiles purchased in 1983 for operations in Chad The 35th Parachute Artillery Regiment made an unsuccessful fire during a Libyan bombardment on 10 September 1987 and shot down a Hercules transport aircraft on 7 July 1988 [47]\n\n\nTajik civil war\nTajik Islamist opposition forces operating from Afghanistan during the 1992–97 Tajik civil war encountered a heavy air campaign launched by Russia and Uzbekistan to prop up the government in Dushanbe that included border and cross-border raids During one of these operations, a Sukhoi Su-24M was shot down on 3 May 1993 with a Stinger fired by the opposition Both Russian pilots were rescued [49]\n\n\nChechen War\nRussian officials claimed several times that the Chechen militia and insurgents possessed US-made Stinger missiles They attributed a few of their aerial losses to the American MANPADS The presence of such missiles was confirmed by photo evidence, and were said to originate from Afghan smuggling routes that passed through Georgia [50]\nIt is believed one Sukhoi Su-24 was shot down by a Stinger missile during the Second Chechen War [51]\n\n\nSri Lankan civil war\nThe Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam also managed to acquire one or several Stingers, possibly from former Mujahideen stocks, and used at least one to down a Sri Lanka Air Force Mi-24 on 10 November 1997 [42] [52]\n\n\nUnited States\nIn 2000, the U.S inventory contained 13,400 missiles The total cost of the program is $7,281,000,000 [53]\nIt is rumored that the United States Secret Service has Stinger missiles to defend the President, a notion that has never been dispelled; however, U.S Secret Service plans favor moving the President to a safer place in the event of an attack rather than shooting down the plane, lest the missile (or the wreckage of the target aircraft) hit innocents [54]\n\n\nSyrian civil war\nIn the Syrian civil war, Turkey reportedly helped to transport a limited amount of FIM-92 Stingers to the Free Syrian Army [55]\n\n\nRusso-Ukrainian War\nIn February 2022, several countries announced that they were providing Stinger missiles to Ukrainian forces defending against the Russian invasion.\nGermany announced that it would provide 500 missiles [57]\nDenmark said that it will provide parts for 300 missiles, to be assembled in the United States [58]\nThe Netherlands stated they would supply 200 units [59]\nItaly, [60]\nLatvia, [61]\nLithuania, [62]\nand the United States [63] each stated that they would provide undisclosed

Stinger is a passive surface-to-air missile system designed for use by a single operator. It is a shoulder-fired missile system that can be used to engage a wide range of targets, including aircraft, helicopters, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe FIM-92 Stinger was developed in the 1970s as a replacement for the FIM-43 Redeye missile system. It was designed to be a more advanced and capable system, with a longer range and improved guidance system. The Stinger was first deployed in the 1980s and has since been used by a number of countries around the world.\n\n**History**\n\nThe development of the FIM-92 Stinger began in the 1970s, with General Dynamics being awarded a contract to design and develop the system. The first prototype of the Stinger was completed in 1974, and the system underwent a series of tests and evaluations before being declared operational in 1978. The first production batch of Stingers was delivered to the US military in 1979.\n\nThe Stinger was first used in combat during the Falklands War in 1982, where it was employed by the British Army's Special Air Service (SAS) to defend against Argentine aircraft. The Stinger was also used during the Soviet-Afghan War in the 1980s, where it was employed by the CIA to support the Mujahideen rebels.\n\nThe Stinger has since been used in a number of other conflicts, including the Angolan civil war, the Libyan invasion of Chad, and the Chechen War. It has also been used by a number of countries around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Turkey.\n\n**Variants**\n\nThere have been several variants of the FIM-92 Stinger developed over the years. The most common variant is the FIM-92A, which is the original production model. The FIM-92B is an improved variant that was developed in the 1980s, with a new seeker and improved guidance system. The FIM-92C is a variant that was developed for use on the M1097 Avenger vehicle.\n\n**Service**\n\nThe FIM-92 Stinger has been used by a number of countries around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Turkey. It has been employed in a number of conflicts, including the Falklands War, the Soviet-Afghan War, and the Chechen War.\n\nThe Stinger has been used in a number of different roles, including air defense and ground attack. It has been employed against a wide range of targets, including aircraft, helicopters, and UAVs.\n\n**Operators**\n\nThe FIM-92 Stinger has been used by a number of countries around the world,

missile that can be shoulder-fired by a single operator (although standard military procedure calls for two operators –  team chief and gunner) [4] The Stinger was intended to supplant the FIM-43 Redeye system, the principal difference being that, unlike the Redeye, the Stinger can acquire the target from head-on, giving much more time to acquire and destroy the target The FIM-92B missile can also be fired from the M1097 Avenger and the M6 Linebacker The missile is also capable of being deployed from a Humvee Stinger rack and can be used by airborne troops A helicopter launched version exists and is called Air-to-Air Stinger (ATAS).\n\n\nHistory\nThe missile began as a program by General Dynamics to produce an improved variant of their 1967 FIM-43 Redeye Production of the Redeye ran from 1969 to 1982, with a total production of around 85,000 missiles The program was accepted for further development as Redeye II by the U.S Army in 1971 and designated FIM-92; the Stinger appellation was chosen in 1972 Because of technical difficulties that dogged testing, the first shoulder launch was not until mid-1975 Production of the FIM-92A began in 1978 An improved Stinger with a new seeker, the FIM-92B, was produced from 1983 alongside the FIM-92A Production of both the A and B types ended in 1987 with around 16,000 missiles produced.\n\n\nReplacement\nThe original Stinger's reprogrammable microprocessor has become obsolete in 2023, and a service life extension will keep the Block I in service until 2030 With the arsenal declining from obsolescence, on 10 November 2020 the U.S Army issued a request for information for a replacement MANPADS The new system will be compatible with the Stinger Vehicle Universal Launcher used on the IM-SHORAD and be able to defeat fixed and rotary-wing aircraft, as well as Group 2 and 3 UAS as well as or better than the Stinger A contract for up to 8,000 missiles is planned to be awarded by 2026 [7] [8] The request for information to interested firms only went out in April 2022, [9] and RTX and Lockheed Martin were selected to competitively develop the Stinger replacement in September 2023 [10]\n\n\nVariants\nThe Stinger's combat debut occurred during the Falklands War (Spanish: Guerra de las Malvinas) fought between the United Kingdom and Argentina At the onset of the conflict soldiers of the British Army's Special Air Service (SAS) had been clandestinely equipped with six missiles, although they had received little instruction in their use The sole SAS trooper who had received training on the system, and was due to train other troops, was killed in a helicopter crash on 19 May [19]\n\n\nService\nThe Stinger's combat debut occurred during the Falklands War (Spanish: Guerra de las Malvinas) fought

system, and was due to train other troops, was killed in a helicopter crash on 19 May [19]\n\n\nSoviet War in Afghanistan\nIn late 1985, several groups, such as Free the Eagle, began arguing the CIA was not doing enough to support the Mujahideen in the Soviet–Afghan War Michael Pillsbury, Vincent Cannistraro, and others put enormous bureaucratic pressure on the CIA to provide the Stinger to the rebels The idea was controversial because up to that point, the CIA had been operating with the pretense that the United States was not involved in the war directly, for various reasons All weapons supplied up to that point were non-U.S sourced weapons, including Kalashnikov style assault rifles made in China and Egypt [22]\n\n\nAngolan civil war\nThe Reagan administration provided 310 Stingers to Jonas Savimbi's UNITA movement in Angola between 1986 and 1989 [44] As in Afghanistan, efforts to recover missiles after the end of hostilities proved incomplete The battery of a Stinger lasts for four or five years, so any battery supplied in the 1980s would now be inoperative [45] but during the Syrian Civil War, insurgents showed how easily they switched to different batteries, including common car batteries, as power sources for several MANPADS models [46]\n\n\nLibyan invasion of Chad\nThe French army used 15 firing positions and 30 missiles purchased in 1983 for operations in Chad The 35th Parachute Artillery Regiment made an unsuccessful fire during a Libyan bombardment on 10 September 1987 and shot down a Hercules transport aircraft on 7 July 1988 [47]\n\n\nTajik civil war\nTajik Islamist opposition forces operating from Afghanistan during the 1992–97 Tajik civil war encountered a heavy air campaign launched by Russia and Uzbekistan to prop up the government in Dushanbe that included border and cross-border raids During one of these operations, a Sukhoi Su-24M was shot down on 3 May 1993 with a Stinger fired by the opposition Both Russian pilots were rescued [49]\n\n\nChechen War\nRussian officials claimed several times that the Chechen militia and insurgents possessed US-made Stinger missiles They attributed a few of their aerial losses to the American MANPADS The presence of such missiles was confirmed by photo evidence, and were said to originate from Afghan smuggling routes that passed through Georgia [50]\nIt is believed one Sukhoi Su-24 was shot down by a Stinger missile during the Second Chechen War [51]\n\n\nSri Lankan civil war\nThe Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam also managed to acquire one or several Stingers, possibly from former Mujahideen stocks, and used at least one to down a Sri Lanka Air Force Mi-24 on 10 November 1997 [42] [52]\n\n\nUnited States\nIn 2000, the U.S inventory contained 13,400 missiles The total cost of the program is $7,281,000,000 [53]\nIt is rumored that the United States Secret Service has Stinger missiles to defend the President, a notion that has never been dispelled; however, U.S Secret Service plans favor moving the President to a safer place in the event of an attack rather than shooting down the plane, lest the missile (or the wreckage of the target aircraft) hit innocents [54]\n\n\nSyrian civil war\nIn the Syrian civil war, Turkey reportedly helped to transport a limited amount of FIM-92 Stingers to the Free Syrian Army [55]\n\n\nRusso-Ukrainian War\nIn February 2022, several countries announced that they were providing Stinger missiles to Ukrainian forces defending against the Russian invasion.\nGermany announced that it would provide 500 missiles [57]\nDenmark said that it will provide parts for 300 missiles, to be assembled in the United States [58]\nThe Netherlands stated they would supply 200 units [59]\nItaly, [60]\nLatvia, [61]\nLithuania, [62]\nand the United States [63] each stated that they would provide undisclosed amounts.\n\n\nOperators\n\n\n\nCountries\n\n\nOrganizations\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal

The club was founded on 19 December 1909 by a group of young men unhappy with the Catholic church-sponsored Trinity Youth, where they played football under the stern and unsympathetic eye of the local parish priest, Father Dewald. The founders were Franz and Paul Braun, Henry Cleve, Hans Debest, Paul Dziendzielle, Franz, Julius, and Wilhelm Jacobi, Hans Kahn, Gustav Müller, Franz Risse, Fritz Schulte, Hans Siebold, August Tönnesmann, Heinrich and Robert Unger, Fritz Weber, and Franz Wendt.\n\nThe name \"Borussia\" is Latin for Prussia, but was taken from Borussia beer from the nearby Borussia brewery in Dortmund. The team began playing in blue and white striped shirts with a red sash, and black shorts. In 1913, they donned the black and yellow stripes for the first time.\n\n**History**\n\nBorussia Dortmund featured in the Oberliga West, a first division league which dominated German football through the late 1950s, between 1946 and 1963. In 1949, Borussia reached the final in Stuttgart against VfR Mannheim, which they lost 2–3 after extra time. The club claimed its first national title in 1956 with a 4–2 win against Karlsruher SC. One year later, Borussia defeated Hamburger SV 4–1 to win their second national title. After this coup, the three Alfredos (Alfred Preißler, Alfred Kelbassa, and Alfred Niepieklo) were legends in Dortmund. In 1963, Borussia won the last edition of the German Football Championship (before the introduction of the new Bundesliga) to secure their third national title.\n\n**Bundesliga debut**\n\nIn 1962, the DFB met in Dortmund and voted to establish a professional football league in Germany, to begin play in August 1963 as the Bundesliga. Borussia Dortmund earned its place among the first sixteen clubs to play in the league by winning the last pre-Bundesliga national championship. Runners-up 1 FC Köln also earned an automatic berth. Dortmund's Friedhelm Konietzka scored the first-ever Bundesliga goal a minute into the match, which they would eventually lose 2–3 to Werder Bremen.\n\n**Golden age – the 1990s**\n\nAfter a tenth-place finish in the Bundesliga in 1991, manager Horst Köppel was sacked, and manager Ottmar Hitzfeld was hired. Under Hitzfeld's leadership, Borussia Dortmund experienced a golden era, winning two consecutive Bundesliga titles in 1995 and 1996.\n\n**21st century and Borussia \"goes public\"**\n\nIn October 2000, Borussia Dortmund became the first publicly traded club on the German stock market.\n\n**Klopp era and return to prominence**\n\nIn the 2009–10 season, Klopp's Dortmund improved on the season before, finishing fifth in the Bundesliga to qualify for the UEFA Europa League. The team missed an opportunity to qualify for the Champions League when they did not beat eighth-place VfL Wolfsburg and 14th-place SC Freiburg in the final two matches of the campaign.\n\n**Post-Klopp era**\n\nIn the 2015–16 season, Dortmund started off winning 4–0 against Borussia Mönchengladbach on the opening day, followed by five-straight wins which took them to the top of the Bundesliga. After the eighth matchday, they were surpassed by Bayern Munich following an unlucky draw with 1899 Hoffenheim. Dortmund kept their performances up, winning 24 out of 34 league games and becoming the best Bundesliga runner-up team of all time. In the Europa League, they advanced to the quarter-finals, getting knocked out by a Jürgen Klopp-led Liverpool in a dramatic comeback at Anfield, where defender Dejan Lovren scored a late goal to make it 4–3 to Liverpool and 5–4 on aggregate. In the 2015–16 DFB-Pokal, for the third-straight year, Dortmund made it to the competition final, but lost to Bayern Munich on penalties.\n\n**Crest**\n\nThe Westfalenstadion is the home stadium of Borussia Dortmund, Germany's largest stadium and the seventh-largest in Europe. The stadium was named \"Signal Iduna Park\" after insurance company Signal Iduna purchased the rights to name the stadium until 2021. This name, however, could not be used when hosting FIFA and UEFA events, since these governing bodies have policies forbidding corporate sponsorship from companies that are not official tournament partners. During the 2006 World Cup, the stadium was referred to as \"FIFA World Cup Stadium, Dortmund\", while in UEFA club matches, it is known as \"BVB Stadion Dortmund\". The stadium currently hosts up to 81,359 spectators (standing and seated) for league matches and 65,829 seated spectators for international matches.\n\n**Grounds**\n\nBorussia Dortmund's training ground and academy base Hohenbuschei is located in Brackel, a district of Dortmund. Inside the complex, there are physical fitness and rehabilitation robotics areas, physiotherapy and massage rooms, and remedial and hydrotherapy pools. The facility also includes sauna rooms, steam rooms, and weight rooms, classrooms, conference halls, offices for the BVB front office, a restaurant, and a TV studio to interview the BVB professional footballers and coaching staff for BVB total!, the channel owned by the club. On the grounds, there are five grass pitches, two of which have under-soil heating, one artificial grass field, three small grass pitches, and a multi-functional sports arena. The site covers a total area of 18,000 m2 (190,000 sq ft). In addition, the club owns a Footbonaut, a training robot, which is effectively a 14 m2 (150 sq ft) training cage.\n\n**Organisation and finance**\n\nBorussia Dortmund e.V is represented by its management board and a board of directors consisting of president Dr Reinhard Rauball, his proxy and vice-president Gerd Pieper, and treasurer Dr Reinhold Lunow.\n\n**Current management and board**\n\nDortmund's main advertising partner and current shirt sponsor is Evonik. Since the 2012–13 season, the main equipment supplier has been Puma. The contract is currently valid. The club announced a deal with Opel to be the first-ever sleeve sponsor from the 2017–18 season.\n\n**Kits and sponsorship**\n\nDortmund's main advertising partner and current shirt sponsor is Evonik.

The BVB fan council criticized the decision and was not previously informed by BVB GmbH. Borussia Dortmund's fan department published a statement denying media reports that there was a democratic agreement or even a vote by the fans in connection with the Rheinmetall deal.\n\n**Charity**\n\nBorussia Dortmund has raised money for charity for various causes. On 17 May 2011, Borussia Dortmund held a charity game for the 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami against \"Team Japan\". Ticket sales from the game and €1 million from Dortmund's main sponsor Evonik went to charity for Japan earthquake and tsunami victims. In November 2012, Borussia Dortmund KGaA founded a charitable trust called leuchte auf, to give important social projects financial help. The trust's logo is a star consisting of the streets which meet at Dortmund's Borsigplatz, where the club was founded. On 6 July 2013, Borussia Dortmund held a charity game to raise money for 2013 German flood victims in the German states of Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt.\n\n**Players**\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

He has directed and written several films, including Arinthum Ariyamalum and Thadaiyaraasa. Vishnuvardhan's films often feature a mix of comedy and drama, and he has been praised for his ability to balance these genres.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nVishnuvardhan was born and raised in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. His father, Pattiyal K Shekar, was an actor and producer who worked in Tamil films. Vishnuvardhan has a younger brother, Krishna Kulasekaran, who is also an actor in the Tamil film industry.

The film starred Prakash Raj, Arya, Navdeep, and Samiksha, and was praised for its taut and engaging storyline.\n\nVishnuvardhan's success with Arinthum Ariyamalum led to him being approached by several big stars to direct their films. However, he decided to take a more independent approach and started his own production studio, SJ Films, with his wife, Anu Vardhan, and Malaysian radio jockey, Punnagai Poo Geetha.

Johnny Blaze during the attack by Sin in the form of Skadi and states that he has damned the human race Mephisto then states that he will help Johnny save the human race from the Serpent and the Worthy [41] Mephisto goes on a date with New Mutants member Magma; apparently confiding in her, he explains that, while he is the embodiment of one of the great forces of the universe, the force that created him also gave him desires and emotions, and he occasionally wants to do things that humans do [42] Magma later confided to Blink that she has subsequently seen Mephisto again, but wishes to

effect on the Black Panther, Captain Marvel, the Falcon, Hawkeye, and Jane Foster's Thor form where they were all turned into Ghost Rider-like creatures [51] As Hotel Inferno starts to affect the people of Las Vegas, Doctor Strange fought Mephisto in a game of blackjack The deal is that Mephisto had to return the souls to Las Vegas if Doctor Strange won and that Doctor Strange's soul would be claimed by Mephisto if Mephisto won Though Doctor Strange won by cheating, Mephisto found out and had Doctor Strange tortured [52] Mephisto then turns Doctor Strange into a Ghost Rider-like creature [53] After Mephisto removes the Ghost Rider from Johnny Blaze, he throws Blaze from the roof [54] Mephisto appeared on the battlefield and gloated on them, sending Johnny Blaze to attack him Just

returned from the Realm Between, he assisted the Midnight Sons and the Avengers in preventing Mephisto from returning to his realm to reclaim his throne Though Doctor Strange defeated him, Mephisto fled back to his realm where he was defeated by Johnny Blaze and the different Ghost Riders from across the Multiverse After Johnny Blaze sent Mephisto back to Earth, he was kept at the top of Hotel Inferno in countless restraints as Hotel Inferno remained on Earth As Doctor Strange, the Avengers, and the Midnight Sons left upon Las Vegas returning to normal, Wong remained behind to keep an eye

learned from Doctor Strange to call Mephisto, who states that the Spider-Man of Earth-44145 is out of his jurisdiction The Superior Spider-Man asks Mephisto to restore him to the man he once was for a day so that he can fight the Spider-Man of Earth-44145 While Mephisto states that he either has or does not have his soul, he does have a counteroffer that will restore his body without disease (physical and mental) and the taint of Peter Parker As the Superior Spider-Man tells Anna Maria Marconi that there is no other option, he expects Mephisto to uphold his end of the bargain [62]\n\n\n2020s\nAfter being killed by Deadpool and going to Hell after his death for unspecified war crimes, Phil Coulson makes a deal with Mephisto to be restored to life in exchange for his fealty,

visited Mephisto at the Hotel Inferno asking about what was wrong with Peter Parker's soul as well as how Harry Osborn was seemingly revived as Kindred [64] It was during this confrontation that Mephisto confesses his true motivations for erasing the marriage of the Parkers, as at some undisclosed point in the future he finally seizes control of Earth, only for his reign to be ended by either Spider-Man or his daughter Striking a deal with Peter to affect his soul and erasing both his marriage with Mary Jane and their daughter was Mephisto's way of ensuring that that future would never come to pass in either scenario Mephisto is also revealed as the one responsible for the torment and creation of the Kindred Twins (the souls of Sarah and Gabriel, clones previously created by a temporarily insane Harry when he was alive and a posthumous A.I of him to pose as the children of his father and Gwen Stacy, merged with the A.I in physical demonic forms) as part of his long game waged against Peter Parker and the Osborn family, as well for Norman Osborn's initial transformations into the Green Goblin, having long ago made a deal with him in exchange for Harry's soul Doctor Strange then strikes a deal with Mephisto to have Harry's soul returned to the body of his clone as the clone is dying, alongside the Kindred Twins [38]\n\n\nUsing the Multiversal Masters of Evil\nAt the time when a version of Doctor Doom named Doom Supreme watched the Prehistoric Avengers send Kid Thanos back to his own time, Mephisto approached Doom Supreme and suggested to him that he put together a team that would defeat any team of Avengers Doom Supreme took Mephisto's offer and formed a Multiversal version of the Masters of Evil consisting of a version of Kid Thanos, a version of Dark Phoenix and her pet Berserkers, a version of Erik Killmonger called King Killmonger, a version of the Green Goblin with Ghost Rider-like powers called the Ghost Goblin, and the Black Skull Due to their agreement with the Council of Reds, they had to save Earth-616 for last After each of the attacks from the Multiversal Masters of Evil, Doom Supreme and Kid Thanos meet up with the Iron Inquisitor and Mephisto in the form of a dog as he nears the corpse of the Orb Under Mephisto's orders, Doom Supreme unburns Uatu's eye fragment and puts it in his own eye As Doom Supreme and Kid Thanos enter a portal to meet with their teammates and get back to work, Mephisto and the Iron Inquisitor talk about what to do with the Multiversal Masters of Evil as Mephisto's dog form eats at the

and the Worthy [41] Mephisto goes on a date with New Mutants member Magma; apparently confiding in her, he explains that, while he is the embodiment of one of the great forces of the universe, the force that created him also gave him desires and emotions, and he occasionally wants to do things that humans do [42] Magma later confided to Blink that she has subsequently seen Mephisto again, but

of Las Vegas It also had an effect on the Black Panther, Captain Marvel, the Falcon, Hawkeye, and Jane Foster's Thor form where they were all turned into Ghost Rider-like creatures [51] As Hotel Inferno starts to affect the people of Las Vegas, Doctor Strange fought Mephisto in a game of blackjack The deal is that Mephisto had to return the souls to Las Vegas if Doctor Strange won and that Doctor Strange's soul would be claimed by Mephisto if Mephisto won Though Doctor Strange won by cheating, Mephisto found out and had Doctor Strange tortured [52] Mephisto then turns Doctor Strange into a Ghost Rider-like creature [53] After Mephisto removes the Ghost Rider from Johnny Blaze, he throws Blaze from the roof [54] Mephisto appeared on the battlefield and gloated on them, sending

Proto-Clone) uses a signal move he learned from Doctor Strange to call Mephisto, who states that the Spider-Man of Earth-44145 is out of his jurisdiction The Superior Spider-Man asks Mephisto to restore him to the man he once was for a day so that he can fight the Spider-Man of Earth-44145 While Mephisto states that he either has or does not have his soul, he does have a counteroffer that will restore his body without disease (physical and mental) and the taint of Peter Parker As the Superior Spider-Man tells Anna Maria Marconi that there is no other option, he expects Mephisto to

War\"\nDoctor Strange later visited Mephisto at the Hotel Inferno asking about what was wrong with Peter Parker's soul as well as how Harry Osborn was seemingly revived as Kindred [64] It was during this confrontation that Mephisto confesses his true motivations for erasing the marriage of the Parkers, as at some undisclosed point in the future he finally seizes control of Earth, only for his reign to be ended by either Spider-Man or his daughter Striking a deal with Peter to affect his soul and erasing both his marriage with Mary Jane and their daughter was Mephisto's way of ensuring that that future would never come to pass in either scenario Mephisto is also revealed as the one responsible for the torment and creation of the Kindred Twins (the souls of Sarah and Gabriel, clones previously created by a temporarily insane Harry when he was alive and a posthumous A.I of him to pose as the children of his father and Gwen Stacy, merged with the A.I in physical demonic forms) as

Harry's soul Doctor Strange then strikes a deal with Mephisto to have Harry's soul returned to the body of his clone as the clone is dying, alongside the Kindred Twins [38]\n\n\nUsing the Multiversal Masters of Evil\nAt the time when a version of Doctor Doom named Doom Supreme watched the Prehistoric Avengers send Kid Thanos back to his own time, Mephisto approached Doom Supreme and suggested to him that he put together a team that would defeat any team of Avengers Doom Supreme took Mephisto's offer and formed a Multiversal version of the Masters of Evil consisting of a version of Kid Thanos, a version of Dark Phoenix and her pet Berserkers, a version of Erik Killmonger called King Killmonger, a version of the Green Goblin with Ghost Rider-like powers called the Ghost Goblin, and the Black Skull Due to their agreement with the Council of Reds, they had to save Earth-616 for last After each of the attacks from the Multiversal Masters of Evil, Doom Supreme and Kid Thanos meet up with the Iron Inquisitor and Mephisto in the form of a dog as he nears the corpse of the Orb Under Mephisto's orders, Doom Supreme unburns Uatu's eye fragment and puts it in his own eye As Doom Supreme and Kid Thanos enter a portal to meet with their teammates and get back to work, Mephisto and the Iron Inquisitor talk about what to do with the Multiversal Masters of Evil as Mephisto's dog form eats at the fragments of Uatu's eye Then he has the Orb's corpse dumped into the ocean [65]\n\n\nPowers and abilities\nMephisto is an extremely powerful immortal demonic entity possessing abilities used by manipulating the forces of magic [72] Mephisto can employ his power for a variety of uses, including superhuman physical attributes, shape and sizeshifting, projecting illusions, manipulating memories, and altering time and reality [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [72] He is also highly resistant to injury [78] With his regenerative healing factor, Mephisto has the ability to recover quickly [5]

and the couple had a fifth child, Ruth, in December 1903 [8] In 1906, when Disney was four, the family moved to a farm in Marceline, Missouri, where his uncle Robert had just purchased land In Marceline, Disney developed his interest in drawing when he was paid to draw the horse of a retired neighborhood doctor [9] Elias was a subscriber to the Appeal to Reason newspaper, and Disney practiced drawing by copying the front-page cartoons of Ryan Walker [10] He also began to develop an ability to work with watercolors and crayons [5] He lived near the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway line and became enamored with trains [11] He and his younger sister Ruth started school at the same time at the Park School in Marceline in late 1909 [12] The Disney family were active members of a Congregational church [13]\n\n\nCareer\nIn January 1920, as Pesmen-Rubin's revenue declined after Christmas, Disney, aged 18, and Iwerks were laid off They started their own business, the short-lived Iwerks-Disney Commercial Artists [26] Failing to attract many customers, Disney and Iwerks agreed that Disney should leave temporarily to earn money at the Kansas City Film Ad Company, run by A. V Cauger; the following month Iwerks, who was not able to run their business alone, also joined [27] The company produced commercials using the cutout animation technique [28] Disney became interested in animation, although he preferred drawn cartoons such as Mutt and Jeff and Max Fleischer's Out of the Inkwell With the assistance of a borrowed book on animation and a camera, he began experimenting at home [29] [d] He came to the conclusion that cel animation was more promising than the cutout method [e] Unable to persuade Cauger to try cel animation at the company, Disney opened a new business with a co-worker from the Film Ad Co, Fred Harman [31] Their main client was the local Newman Theater, and the short cartoons they produced were sold as \"Newman's Laugh-O-Grams\" [32] Disney studied Paul Terry's Aesop's Fables as a model, and the first six \"Laugh-O-Grams\" were modernized fairy tales [33]\n\n\nEarly career: 1920–1928\nIn January 1920, as Pesmen-Rubin's revenue declined after Christmas, Disney, aged 18, and Iwerks were laid off They started their own business, the short-lived Iwerks-Disney Commercial Artists [26] Failing to attract many customers, Disney and Iwerks agreed that Disney should leave temporarily to earn money at the Kansas City Film Ad Company, run by A. V Cauger;

industry insiders nicknamed it \"Disney's Folly\" [77] The film, which was the first animated feature made in full color and sound, cost $1.5 million to produce‍—‌three times over budget [78] To ensure the animation was as realistic as possible, Disney sent his animators on courses at the Chouinard Art Institute; [79] he brought animals into the studio and hired actors so that the animators could study realistic movement [80] To portray the changing perspective of the background as a camera moved through a scene, Disney's animators developed a multiplane camera which allowed drawings on pieces of glass to be set at various distances from the camera, creating an illusion of depth The glass could be moved to create the impression of a camera passing through the scene The first work created on the camera‍—‌a Silly Symphony called The Old Mill (1937)‍—‌won the Academy Award for Animated Short Film because of its impressive visual power Although Snow White had been largely finished by the time the multiplane camera had been completed, Disney ordered some scenes be re-drawn to use the new effects [81]\n\n\nWorld War II and beyond: 1941–1950\nShortly after the release of Dumbo in October 1941, the U.S entered World War II Disney formed the Walt Disney Training Films Unit within the company to produce instruction films for the military such as Four Methods of Flush Riveting and Aircraft Production Methods [93] Disney also met with Henry Morgenthau Jr., the Secretary of the Treasury, and agreed to produce short Donald Duck cartoons to promote war bonds [94] Disney also produced several propaganda productions, including shorts such as Der Fuehrer's Face‍—‌which won an Academy Award‍—‌and the 1943 feature film Victory Through Air Power [95]\n\n\nTheme parks, television and other interests: 1950–1966\nIn early 1950, Disney produced Cinderella, his studio's first animated feature in eight years It was popular with critics and theater audiences Costing $2.2 million to produce, it earned nearly $8 million in its first year [100] [o] Disney was less involved than he had been with previous pictures because of his involvement in his first entirely live-action feature, Treasure Island (1950), which was shot in Britain, as was The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men (1952) [101] Other all-live-action features followed, many of which had patriotic themes [58] [p] He continued to produce full-length animated features too, including Alice in Wonderland (1951) and Peter Pan (1953) From the early to mid-1950s, Disney began to devote less attention to the animation department, entrusting most of its operations to his key animators, the Nine Old Men, [q] although he was always present at story meetings Instead, he started concentrating on other ventures [102] Around the same time, Disney  established his own film distribution division Buena Vista, replacing his most recent distributor RKO Pictures [103]\n\n\nIllness, death and aftermath\nDisney had been a heavy smoker since World War I He did not use cigarettes with filters and had smoked a pipe as a young man In early November 1966, he was diagnosed with lung cancer and was treated with cobalt therapy On November 30, he felt unwell and was taken by ambulance from his home to St Joseph Hospital where, on December 15, at age 65, he died of circulatory collapse caused by the cancer [143] [144] [145] [146] His remains were cremated two days later and his ashes interred at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California [147] [u]\n\n\nPersonal life and character\nEarly in 1925, Disney hired an ink artist, Lillian Bounds They married in July of that year, at her brother's house in her home town of Lewiston, Idaho [161] The marriage was generally happy, according to Lillian, although according to Disney's biographer Neal Gabler she did not \"accept Walt's decisions meekly or his status unquestionably, and she admitted that he was always telling people 'how henpecked he is'.\" [162] [w] Lillian had little interest in films or the Hollywood social scene and she was, in the words of the historian Steven Watts, \"content with household management and providing support for her husband\" [163] Their marriage produced two daughters, Diane (born December 1933) and Sharon (adopted in December 1936, born six weeks previously) [164] [x] Within the family, neither Disney nor his wife hid the fact Sharon had been adopted, although they became annoyed if people outside the family raised the point [165] The Disneys were careful to keep their daughters out of the public eye as much as possible, particularly in the light of the Lindbergh kidnapping; Disney took steps to ensure his daughters were not photographed by the press [166]\n\n\nReputation\nViews of Disney and his work have changed over the decades, and there have been polarized opinions [185] Mark Langer, in the American Dictionary of National Biography, writes that \"Earlier evaluations of Disney hailed him as a patriot, folk artist, and popularizer of culture More recently, Disney has been regarded as a paradigm of American imperialism and intolerance, as well as a debaser of culture.\" [58] Steven Watts wrote that some denounce Disney \"as a cynical manipulator of cultural and commercial formulas\", [185] while PBS records that critics have censured his work because of its \"smooth façade of sentimentality and stubborn optimism, its feel-good re-write of American history\" [186]\n\n\nAwards and honors\nDisney received 59 Academy Award nominations, including 22 awards: both totals are records [224] He was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards, but did not win, but he was presented with two Special Achievement Awards‍—‌for Bambi (1942) and The Living Desert (1953)‍—‌and the Cecil B DeMille Award [225] He also received four Emmy Award nominations, winning once, for Best Producer for the Disneyland television series [226] Several of his films are included in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\": Steamboat Willie, The Three Little Pigs, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Fantasia, Pinocchio, Bambi, Dumbo and Mary Poppins [227] In 1998, the American Film Institute published a list of the 100 greatest American films, according to industry experts; the list included Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (at number 49), and Fantasia (at 58) [228]\n\n\nNotes and references\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Walt Disney\n\nIntroduction\n\nWalter Elias Disney, known to the world as Walt Disney, was an American entrepreneur, animator, and filmmaker who revolutionized the entertainment industry with his innovative ideas and creations. He is best known for his eponymous production company, which he founded with his brother Roy in 1923. Disney is widely regarded as one of the most influential and successful filmmakers of the 20th century, with a legacy that continues to inspire generations of artists, animators, and filmmakers.\n\nEarly Life\n\nWalt Disney was born on December 5, 1901, at 1249 Tripp Avenue, in Chicago's Hermosa neighborhood. He was the fourth son of Elias Disney, born in the Province of Canada to Irish parents, and Flora (née Call), an American of German and English descent. Walt's family moved to a farm in Marceline, Missouri, in 1906, where he developed his interest in drawing and began to experiment with animation. He would later credit his time on the farm for instilling in him a love of nature and the outdoors.\n\n## Career Beginnings\n\nIn 1917, Disney dropped out of high school to join the Red Cross Ambulance Corps during World War I. After the war, he moved to Kansas City, where he began his career as an animator at the Pesmen-Rubin Commercial Art Studio. In 1919, he joined the Kansas City Film Ad Company, where he worked as an animator and began to develop his skills in the field.\n\n## Early Career: 1920–1928\n\nIn 1920, Disney and his friend Ub Iwerks started their own business, the Iwerks-Disney Commercial Artists. The company produced commercials for local clients, but ultimately failed to attract a large customer base. In 1922, Disney joined the Laugh-O-Gram Studio, where he produced a series of animated shorts based on popular fairy tales.\n\n## Creation of Mickey Mouse and Following Successes: 1928–1934\n\nIn 1928, Disney and Iwerks developed Mickey Mouse, a character that would become one of the most iconic and beloved in the world. Mickey was created as a replacement for Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, a character Disney had created for Universal Pictures. Disney's original choice of name for the character was Mortimer Mouse, but his wife Lillian suggested Mickey instead.\n\n## Golden Age of Animation: 1934–1941\n\nIn 1934, Disney began the production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, a feature-length animated film that would become a groundbreaking success. The film, which was the first animated feature made in full color and sound, cost $1.5 million to produce and earned nearly $8 million in its first year. Disney's success with Snow White led to the creation of a series of successful animated features, including Pinocchio, Fantasia, and Bambi.\n\n## World War II and Beyond: 1941–1950\n\nIn 1941, the United States entered World War II, and Disney began to produce films and training materials for the military. He also produced a series of propaganda films, including Der Fuehrer's Face, which won an Academy Award. In 1943, Disney produced the feature film Victory Through Air Power, which was a critical and commercial success.\n\n## Theme Parks, Television and Other Interests: 1950–1966\n\nIn the 1950s, Disney began to devote less attention to the animation department and more to other ventures. He established his own film distribution division, Buena Vista, and began to produce live-action films, including Treasure Island and The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men. Disney also began to focus on theme park development, opening Disneyland in Anaheim, California in 1955.\n\n## Illness, Death and Aftermath\n\nIn 1966, Disney was diagnosed with lung cancer and underwent cobalt therapy. He died on December 15, 1966, at the age of 65. His ashes were interred at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.\n\nPersonal Life and Character\n\nDisney was married to Lillian Bounds in 1925, and the couple had two daughters, Diane and Sharon. Disney was known for his love of nature and the outdoors, and was a heavy smoker throughout his life. He was also known for his perfectionism and attention to detail, which drove him to create some of the most iconic and enduring films of the 20th century.\n\nReputation\n\nDisney's legacy has been the subject of much debate and discussion over the years. Some have praised his innovative and creative contributions to the entertainment industry, while others have criticized his depiction of certain cultures and groups. Despite these criticisms, Disney remains one of the most beloved and respected figures in the history of cinema.\n\nAwards and Honors\n\nDisney received 59 Academy Award nominations, including 22 wins. He was also awarded the Cecil B. DeMille Award and the Special Achievement Award for his contributions to the film industry. Several of his films are included in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Walt_Disney\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nDisney was born on December 5, 1901, at 1249 Tripp Avenue, in Chicago's Hermosa neighborhood [b] He was the fourth son of Elias Disney‍—‌born in the Province of Canada, to Irish parents‍—‌and Flora (née Call), an American of German and English descent [4] [5] [c] Aside from Walt, Elias and Flora's sons were Herbert, Raymond and Roy; and the couple had a fifth child, Ruth, in December 1903 [8] In 1906, when Disney was four, the family moved to a farm in Marceline, Missouri, where his uncle Robert had just purchased land In Marceline, Disney developed his interest in drawing when he was paid to draw the horse of a retired neighborhood doctor [9] Elias was a subscriber to the Appeal to Reason newspaper, and Disney practiced drawing by copying the front-page cartoons of Ryan Walker [10] He also began to develop an ability to work with watercolors and crayons [5] He lived near the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway line and became enamored with trains [11] He and his younger sister Ruth started school at the same time at the Park School in Marceline in late 1909 [12] The Disney family were active members of a Congregational church [13]\n\n\nCareer\nIn January 1920, as Pesmen-Rubin's revenue declined after Christmas, Disney, aged 18, and Iwerks were laid off They started their own business, the short-lived Iwerks-Disney Commercial Artists [26] Failing to attract many customers, Disney and Iwerks agreed that Disney should leave temporarily to earn money at the Kansas City Film Ad Company, run by A. V Cauger; the following month Iwerks, who was not able to run their business alone, also joined [27] The company produced commercials using the cutout animation technique [28] Disney became interested in animation, although he preferred drawn cartoons such as Mutt and Jeff and Max Fleischer's Out of the Inkwell With the assistance of a borrowed book on animation and a camera, he began experimenting at home [29] [d] He came to the conclusion that cel animation was more promising than the cutout method [e] Unable to persuade Cauger to try cel animation at the company, Disney opened a new business with a co-worker from the Film Ad Co, Fred Harman [31] Their main client was the local Newman Theater, and the short cartoons they produced were sold as \"Newman's Laugh-O-Grams\" [32] Disney studied Paul Terry's Aesop's Fables as a model, and the first six \"Laugh-O-Grams\" were modernized fairy tales [33]\n\n\nEarly career: 1920–1928\nIn January 1920, as Pesmen-Rubin's revenue declined after Christmas, Disney, aged 18, and Iwerks were laid off They started their own business, the short-lived Iwerks-Disney Commercial Artists [26] Failing to attract many customers, Disney and Iwerks agreed that Disney should leave temporarily to earn money at the Kansas City Film Ad Company, run by A. V Cauger;

industry insiders nicknamed it \"Disney's Folly\" [77] The film, which was the first animated feature made in full color and sound, cost $1.5 million to produce‍—‌three times over budget [78] To ensure the animation was as realistic as possible, Disney sent his animators on courses at the Chouinard Art Institute; [79] he brought animals into the studio and hired actors so that the animators could study realistic movement [80] To portray the changing perspective of the background as a camera moved through a scene, Disney's animators developed a multiplane camera which allowed drawings on pieces of glass to be set at various distances from the camera, creating an illusion of depth The glass could be moved to create the impression of a camera passing through the scene The first work created on the camera‍—‌a Silly Symphony called The Old Mill (1937)‍—‌won the Academy Award for Animated Short Film because of its impressive visual power Although Snow White had been largely finished by the time the multiplane camera had been completed, Disney ordered some scenes be re-drawn to use the new effects [81]\n\n\nWorld War II and beyond: 1941–1950\nShortly after the release of Dumbo in October 1941, the U.S entered World War II Disney formed the Walt Disney Training Films Unit within the company to produce instruction films for the military such as Four Methods of Flush Riveting and Aircraft Production Methods [93] Disney also met with Henry Morgenthau Jr., the Secretary of the Treasury, and agreed to produce short Donald Duck cartoons to promote war bonds [94] Disney also produced several propaganda productions, including shorts such as Der Fuehrer's Face‍—‌which won an Academy Award‍—‌and the 1943 feature film Victory Through Air Power [95]\n\n\nTheme parks, television and other interests: 1950–1966\nIn early 1950, Disney produced Cinderella, his studio's first animated feature in eight years It was popular with critics and theater audiences Costing $2.2 million to produce, it earned nearly $8 million in its first year [100] [o] Disney was less involved than he had been with previous pictures because of his involvement in his first entirely live-action feature, Treasure Island (1950), which was shot in Britain, as was The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men (1952) [101] Other all-live-action features followed, many of which had patriotic themes [58] [p] He continued to produce full-length animated features too, including Alice in Wonderland (1951) and Peter Pan (1953) From the early to mid-1950s, Disney began to devote less attention to the animation department, entrusting most of its operations to his key animators, the Nine Old Men, [q] although he was always present at story meetings Instead, he started concentrating on other ventures [102] Around the same time, Disney  established his own film distribution division Buena Vista, replacing his most recent distributor RKO Pictures [103]\n\n\nIllness, death and aftermath\nDisney had been a heavy smoker since World War I He did not use cigarettes with filters and had smoked a pipe as a young man In early November 1966, he was diagnosed with lung cancer and was treated with cobalt therapy On November 30, he felt unwell and was taken by ambulance from his home to St Joseph Hospital where, on December 15, at age 65, he died of circulatory collapse caused by the cancer [143] [144] [145] [146] His remains were cremated two days later and his ashes interred at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California [147] [u]\n\n\nPersonal life and character\nEarly in 1925, Disney hired an ink artist, Lillian Bounds They married in July of that year, at her brother's house in her home town of Lewiston, Idaho [161] The marriage was generally happy, according to Lillian, although according to Disney's biographer Neal Gabler she did not \"accept Walt's decisions meekly or his status unquestionably, and she admitted that he was always telling people 'how henpecked he is'.\" [162] [w] Lillian had little interest in films or the Hollywood social scene and she was, in the words of the historian Steven Watts, \"content with household management and providing support for her husband\" [163] Their marriage produced two daughters, Diane (born December 1933) and Sharon (adopted in December 1936, born six weeks previously) [164] [x] Within the family, neither Disney nor his wife hid the fact Sharon had been adopted, although they became annoyed if people outside the family raised the point [165] The Disneys were careful to keep their daughters out of the public eye as much as possible, particularly in the light of the Lindbergh kidnapping; Disney took steps to ensure his daughters were not photographed by the press [166]\n\n\nReputation\nViews of Disney and his work have changed over the decades, and there have been polarized opinions [185] Mark Langer, in the American Dictionary of National Biography, writes that \"Earlier evaluations of Disney hailed him as a patriot, folk artist, and popularizer of culture More recently, Disney has been regarded as a paradigm of American imperialism and intolerance, as well as a debaser of culture.\" [58] Steven Watts wrote that some denounce Disney \"as a cynical manipulator of cultural and commercial formulas\", [185] while PBS records that critics have censured his work because of its \"smooth façade of sentimentality and stubborn optimism, its feel-good re-write of American history\" [186]\n\n\nAwards and honors\nDisney received 59 Academy Award nominations, including 22 awards: both totals are records [224] He was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards, but did not win, but he was presented with two Special Achievement Awards‍—‌for Bambi (1942) and The Living Desert (1953)‍—‌and the Cecil B DeMille Award [225] He also received four Emmy Award nominations, winning once, for Best Producer for the Disneyland television series [226] Several of his films are included in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\": Steamboat Willie, The Three Little Pigs, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Fantasia, Pinocchio, Bambi, Dumbo and Mary Poppins [227] In 1998, the American Film Institute published a list of the 100 greatest American films, according to industry experts; the list included Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (at number 49), and Fantasia (at 58) [228]\n\n\nNotes and references\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Scotland and the Low Countries had strong trading and cultural links during this period, which is also evident in the history of golf [6]\n\n\nOlympics\nCurling has been a medal sport in the Winter Olympic Games since the 1998 Winter Olympics It currently includes men's, women's, and mixed doubles tournaments (the mixed doubles event was held for the first time in 2018) [27]\n\n\nEquipment\nThe playing surface or curling sheet is defined by the World Curling Federation Rules of Curling [30] It is a rectangular area of ice, carefully prepared to be as flat and level as possible, 146 to 150 feet (45 to 46 m) in length by 14.5 to 16.5 feet (4.4 to 5.0 m) in width The shorter borders of the sheet are called the backboards.\n\n\nCurling sheet\nThe playing surface or curling sheet is defined by the World Curling Federation Rules of Curling [30] It is a rectangular area of ice, carefully prepared to be as flat and level as possible, 146 to 150 feet (45 to 46 m) in length by 14.5 to 16.5 feet (4.4 to 5.0 m) in width The shorter borders of the sheet are called the backboards.\n\n\nCurling stone\nThe curling stone (also sometimes called a rock in North America) is made of granite and is specified by the World Curling Federation, which requires a weight between 19.96 and 17.24 kilograms (44 and 38 lb), a maximum circumference of 914 millimetres (36 in), and a minimum height of 114 millimetres (4+1⁄2 in) [30] The only part of the stone in contact with the ice is the running surface, a narrow, flat annulus or ring, 6.4 to 12.7 millimetres (1⁄4 to 1⁄2 in) wide and about 130 millimetres (5 in) in diameter; the sides of the stone bulge convex down to the ring, with the inside of the ring hollowed concave to clear the ice This concave bottom was first proposed by J S Russell of Toronto, Ontario, Canada sometime after 1870, and was subsequently adopted by Scottish stone manufacturer Andrew Kay [23]\n\n\nCurling broom\nThe curling broom, or brush, is used to sweep the ice surface in the path of the stone (see sweeping) and is also often used as a balancing aid during delivery of the stone.\n\n\nShoes\nCurling shoes are similar to ordinary athletic shoes except for special soles; the slider shoe (usually known as a \"slider\") is designed for the sliding foot and the \"gripper shoe\" (usually known as a gripper) for the foot that kicks off from the hack.\n\n\nOther equipment\nOther types of equipment include:\n\n\nGameplay\nThe purpose of a game is to score points by getting stones closer to the house centre, or the \"button\", than the other team's stones [47] Players from either team alternate in taking shots from the far side of the sheet An end is complete when all eight rocks from each team have been delivered, a total of sixteen stones If the teams are tied at the end of regulation, often extra ends are played to break the tie The winner is the team with the highest score after all ends have been completed (see Scoring below) A game may be conceded if winning the game is infeasible.\n\n\nDelivery\nThe process of sliding a stone down the sheet is known as the delivery or throw Players, with the exception of the skip, take turns throwing and sweeping; when one player (e.g., the lead) throws, the players not delivering (the second and third) sweep (see Sweeping, below) When the skip throws, the vice-skip takes their role.\n\n\nSweeping\nAfter the stone is delivered, its trajectory is influenced by the two sweepers under instruction from the skip Sweeping is done for several reasons: to make the stone travel further, to decrease the amount of curl, and to clean debris from the stone's path [55] Sweeping is able to make the stone travel further and straighter by slightly melting the ice under the brooms, thus decreasing the friction as the stone travels across that part of the ice The stones curl more as they slow down, so sweeping early in travel tends to increase distance as well as straighten the path, and sweeping after sideways motion is established can increase the sideways distance.\n\n\nBurning a stone\nOccasionally, players may accidentally touch a stone with their broom or a body part This is often referred to as burning a stone Players touching a stone in such a manner are expected to call their own infraction as a matter of good sportsmanship Touching a stationary stone when no stones are in motion (there is no delivery in progress) is not an infraction as long as the stone is struck in such a manner that its position is not altered, and this is a common way for the skip to indicate a stone that is to be taken out.\n\n\nTypes of shots\nMany different types of shots are used to carefully place stones for strategic or tactical reasons; they fall into three fundamental categories as follows:\n\n\nFree guard zone\nThe free guard zone is the area of the curling sheet between the hog line and tee line, excluding the house Until five stones have been played (three from the side without hammer and two from the side with hammer), stones in the free guard zone may not be removed by an opponent's stone, although they can be moved within the playing area If a stone in the free guard zone is knocked out of play, it is placed back in the position it was in before the shot was thrown and the opponent's stone is removed from play This rule is known as the five-rock rule or the free guard zone rule (previous versions of the free guard zone rule only limited removing guards from play in the first three or four rocks) [57]\n\n\nHammer\nThe last rock in an end is called the hammer, and throwing the hammer gives a team a tactical advantage Before the game, teams typically decide who gets the hammer in the first end either by chance (such as a coin toss), by a \"draw-to-the-button\" contest, where a representative of each team shoots to see who gets closer to the centre of the rings, or, particularly in tournament settings like the Winter Olympics, by a comparison of each team's win–loss record In all subsequent ends, the team that did not score in the preceding end gets to throw second, thus having the hammer In the event that neither team scores, called a blanked end, the hammer remains with the same team Naturally, it is easier to score points with the hammer than without; the team with the hammer generally tries to score two or more points If only one point is possible, the skip may try to avoid scoring at all in order to retain the hammer the next end, giving the team another chance to use the hammer advantage to try to score two points Scoring without the hammer is commonly referred to as stealing, or a steal, and is much more difficult.\n\n\nStrategy\nCurling is a game of strategy, tactics, and skill The strategy depends on the team's skill, the opponent's skill, the conditions of the ice, the score of the game, how many ends remain and whether the team has last-stone advantage (the hammer) A team may play an end aggressively or defensively Aggressive playing will put a lot of stones in play by throwing mostly draws; this makes for an exciting game and although risky the rewards can be great Defensive playing will throw a lot of hits preventing a lot of stones in play; this tends to be less exciting and less risky A good drawing team will usually opt to play aggressively, while a good hitting team will opt to play defensively.\n\n\nConceding a game\nIt is common at any level for a losing team to terminate the match before all ends are completed if it believes it no longer has a realistic chance of winning Competitive games end once the losing team has \"run out of rocks\"—that is, once it has fewer stones in play and available for play than the number of points needed to tie the game.\n\n\nDispute resolution\nMost decisions about rules are left to the skips, although in official tournaments, decisions may be left to the officials However, all scoring disputes are handled by the vice skip No players other than the vice skip from each team should be in the house while score is being determined In tournament play, the most frequent circumstance in which a decision has to be made by someone other than the vice skip is the failure of the vice skips to agree on which stone is closest to the button An independent official (supervisor at Canadian and World championships) then measures the distances using a specially designed device that pivots at the centre of the button When no independent officials are available, the vice skips measure the distances.\n\n\nScoring\nThe winner is the team having the highest number of accumulated points at the completion of ten ends Points are scored at the conclusion of each of these ends as follows: when each team has thrown its eight stones, the team with the stone closest to the button wins that end; the winning team is then awarded one point for each of its own stones lying closer to the button than the opponent's closest stone.\n\n\nCulture\nCompetition teams are normally named after the skip, for example, Team Martin after skip Kevin Martin Amateur league players can (and do) creatively name their teams, but when in competition (a bonspiel) the official team will have a standard name.\n\n\nGood sportsmanship\nMore so than in many other team sports, good sportsmanship, often referred to as the \"Spirit of Curling\", is an integral part of curling The Spirit of Curling also leads teams to congratulate their opponents for making a good shot, strong sweeping, or spectacular form Perhaps most importantly, the Spirit of Curling dictates that one never cheers mistakes, misses, or gaffes by one's opponent (unlike most team sports), and one should not celebrate one's own good shots during the game beyond modest acknowledgement of the shot such as a head nod, fist bump, or thumbs-up gesture Modest congratulation, however, may be exchanged between winning team members after the match On-the-ice celebration is usually reserved for the winners of a major tournament after winning the final game of the championship It is completely unacceptable to attempt to throw opposing players off their game by way of negative comment, distraction, or heckling [78]\n\n\nAccessibility\nCurling has been adapted for wheelchair users and people otherwise unable to throw the stone from the hack These curlers may use a device known as a \"delivery stick\" The cue holds on to the handle of the stone and is then pushed along by the curler At the end of delivery, the curler pulls back on the cue, which releases it from the stone [80] The Canadian Curling Association Rules of Curling allows the use of a delivery stick in club play, but does not permit it in championships.\n\n\nTerminology\nTerms used to describe the game include:\n\n\nChampions and major championships\n\n\nNotable clubs\n\n\nIn popular culture\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Curling**\n\nCurling is a winter sport played on ice, where players slide stones across the ice towards a target called the \"house.\" The game has a rich history, dating back to the 16th century in Scotland, and has been a popular sport around the world for centuries. Today, curling is a medal sport in the Winter Olympic Games, and has a strong following in many countries.\n\n**History**\n\nThe earliest known evidence of curling in Scotland dates back to 1511, when a curling stone was inscribed with that date and discovered in an old pond at Dunblane, Scotland. Another stone with the date 1551 was also found at the same location. The world's oldest curling stone and the world's oldest football are now kept in the same museum, the Stirling Smith Art Gallery and Museum, in Stirling, Scotland. The first written reference to a contest using stones on ice comes from the records of Paisley Abbey, Renfrewshire, in February 1541. Two paintings, \"Winter Landscape with a Bird Trap\" and \"The Hunters in the Snow,\" both dated 1565, by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, depict Flemish peasants curling, albeit without brooms. Scotland and the Low Countries had strong trading and cultural links during this period, which is also evident in the history of golf.\n\n**Olympics**\n\nCurling has been a medal sport in the Winter Olympic Games since the 1998 Winter Olympics. The sport currently includes men's, women's, and mixed doubles tournaments. The mixed doubles event was held for the first time in 2018.\n\n**Equipment**\n\nThe playing surface or curling sheet is defined by the World Curling Federation Rules of Curling. It is a rectangular area of ice, carefully prepared to be as flat and level as possible, 146 to 150 feet (45 to 46 meters) in length by 14.5 to 16.5 feet (4.4 to 5.0 meters) in width. The shorter borders of the sheet are called the backboards.\n\nThe curling stone, also sometimes called a rock in North America, is made of granite and is specified by the World Curling Federation. It requires a weight between 19.96 and 17.24 kilograms (44 and 38 pounds), a maximum circumference of 914 millimeters (36 inches), and a minimum height of 114 millimeters (4.5 inches). The only part of the stone in contact with the ice is the running surface, a narrow, flat annulus or ring, 6.4 to 12.7 millimeters (1/4 to 1/2 inch) wide and about 130 millimeters (5 inches) in diameter. The sides of the stone bulge convex down to the ring, with the inside of the ring hollowed concave to clear the ice.\n\nThe curling broom, or brush, is used to sweep the ice surface in the path of the stone and is also often used as a balancing aid during delivery of the stone. Curling shoes are similar to ordinary athletic shoes except for special soles. The slider shoe, usually known as a \"slider,\" is designed for the sliding foot, and the \"gripper shoe,\" usually known as a gripper, is for the foot that kicks off from the hack.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nThe purpose of a game is to score points by getting stones closer to the house centre, or the \"button,\" than the other team's stones. Players from either team alternate in taking shots from the far side of the sheet. An end is complete when all eight rocks from each team have been delivered, a total of sixteen stones. If the teams are tied at the end of regulation, often extra ends are played to break the tie. The winner is the team with the highest score after all ends have been completed.\n\n**Delivery**\n\nThe process of sliding a stone down the sheet is known as the delivery or throw. Players, with the exception of the skip, take turns throwing and sweeping. When one player throws, the players not delivering sweep. When the skip throws, the vice-skip takes their role.\n\n**Sweeping**\n\nAfter the stone is delivered, its trajectory is influenced by the two sweepers under instruction from the skip. Sweeping is done for several reasons: to make the stone travel further, to decrease the amount of curl, and to clean debris from the stone's path. Sweeping is able to make the stone travel further and straighter by slightly melting the ice under the brooms, thus decreasing the friction as the stone travels across that part of the ice.\n\n**Burning a Stone**\n\nOccasionally, players may accidentally touch a stone with their broom or a body part. This is often referred to as burning a stone. Players touching a stone in such a manner are expected to call their own infraction as a matter of good sportsmanship.\n\n**Types of Shots**\n\nMany different types of shots are used to carefully place stones for strategic or tactical reasons. They fall into three fundamental categories:\n\n*   **Draw:** A shot that stops in a specific location on the ice.\n*   **Takeout:** A shot that knocks an opponent's stone out of play.\n*   **Guard:** A shot that blocks an opponent's path to the house.\n\n**Free Guard Zone**\n\nThe free guard zone is the area of the curling sheet between the hog line and tee line, excluding the house. Until five stones have been played (three from the side without hammer and two from the side with hammer), stones in the free guard zone may not be removed by an opponent's stone, although they can be moved within the playing area.\n\n**Hammer**\n\nThe last rock in an end is called the hammer, and throwing the hammer gives a team a tactical advantage. Before the game, teams typically decide who gets the hammer in the first end either by chance (such as a coin toss), by a \"draw-to-the-button\" contest, where a representative of each team shoots to see who gets closer to the centre of the rings, or, particularly in tournament settings like the Winter Olympics, by a comparison of each team's win-loss record.\n\n**Strategy**\n\nCurling is a game of strategy, tactics, and skill. The strategy depends on the team's skill, the opponent's skill, the conditions of the ice, the score of the game, how many ends remain and whether the team has last-stone advantage (the hammer). A team may play an end aggressively or defensively. Aggressive playing will put a lot of stones in play by throwing mostly draws; this makes for an exciting game and although risky the rewards can be great. Defensive playing will throw a lot of hits preventing a lot of stones in play; this tends to be less exciting and less risky.\n\n**Conceding a Game**\n\nIt is common at any level for a losing team to terminate the match before all ends are completed if it believes it no longer has a realistic chance of winning. Competitive games end once the losing team has \"run out of rocks\" — that is, once it has fewer stones in play and available for play than the number of points needed to tie the game.\n\n**Dispute Resolution**\n\nMost decisions about rules are left to the skips, although in official tournaments, decisions may be left to the officials. However, all scoring disputes are handled by the vice skip. No players other than the vice skip from each team should be in the house while score is being determined.\n\n**Scoring**\n\nThe winner is the team having the highest number of accumulated points at the completion of ten ends. Points are scored at the conclusion of each of these ends as follows: when each team has thrown its eight stones, the team with the stone closest to the button wins that end; the winning team is then awarded one point for each of its own stones lying closer to the button than the opponent's closest stone.\n\n**Good Sportsmanship**\n\nMore so than in many other team sports, good sportsmanship is an integral part of curling. Good sportsmanship leads teams to congratulate their opponents for making a good shot, strong sweeping, or spectacular form. Perhaps most importantly, the Spirit of Curling dictates that one never cheers mistakes, misses, or gaffes by one's opponent.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Curling\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nEvidence that curling existed in Scotland in the early 16th century includes a curling stone inscribed with the date 1511 found (along with another bearing the date 1551) when an old pond was drained at Dunblane, Scotland [3] The world's oldest curling stone and the world's oldest football are now kept in the same museum (the Stirling Smith Art Gallery and Museum) in Stirling [4] The first written reference to a contest using stones on ice coming from the records of Paisley Abbey, Renfrewshire, in February 1541 [5] Two paintings, \"Winter Landscape with a Bird Trap\" and \"The Hunters in the Snow\" (both dated 1565) by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, depict Flemish peasants curling, albeit without brooms; Scotland and the Low Countries had strong trading and cultural links during this period, which is also evident in the history of golf [6]\n\n\nOlympics\nCurling has been a medal sport in the Winter Olympic Games since the 1998 Winter Olympics It currently includes men's, women's, and mixed doubles tournaments (the mixed doubles event was held for the first time in 2018) [27]\n\n\nEquipment\nThe playing surface or curling sheet is defined by the World Curling Federation Rules of Curling [30] It is a rectangular area of ice, carefully prepared to be as flat and level as possible, 146 to 150 feet (45 to 46 m) in length by 14.5 to 16.5 feet (4.4 to 5.0 m) in width The shorter borders of the sheet are called the backboards.\n\n\nCurling sheet\nThe playing surface or curling sheet is defined by the World Curling Federation Rules of Curling [30] It is a rectangular area of ice, carefully prepared to be as flat and level as possible, 146 to 150 feet (45 to 46 m) in length by 14.5 to 16.5 feet (4.4 to 5.0 m) in width The shorter borders of the sheet are called the backboards.\n\n\nCurling stone\nThe curling stone (also sometimes called a rock in North America) is made of granite and is specified by the World Curling Federation, which requires a weight between 19.96 and 17.24 kilograms (44 and 38 lb), a maximum circumference of 914 millimetres (36 in), and a minimum height of 114 millimetres (4+1⁄2 in) [30] The only part of the stone in contact with the ice is the running surface, a narrow, flat annulus or ring, 6.4 to 12.7 millimetres (1⁄4 to 1⁄2 in) wide and about 130 millimetres (5 in) in diameter; the sides of the stone bulge convex down to the ring, with the inside of the ring hollowed concave to clear the ice This concave bottom was first proposed by J S Russell of Toronto, Ontario, Canada sometime after 1870, and was subsequently adopted by Scottish stone manufacturer Andrew Kay [23]\n\n\nCurling broom\nThe curling broom, or brush, is used to sweep the ice surface in the path of the stone (see sweeping) and is also often used as a balancing aid during delivery of the stone.\n\n\nShoes\nCurling shoes are similar to ordinary athletic shoes except for special soles; the slider shoe (usually known as a \"slider\") is designed for the sliding foot and the \"gripper shoe\" (usually known as a gripper) for the foot that kicks off from the hack.\n\n\nOther equipment\nOther types of equipment include:\n\n\nGameplay\nThe purpose of a game is to score points by getting stones closer to the house centre, or the \"button\", than the other team's stones [47] Players from either team alternate in taking shots from the far side of the sheet An end is complete when all eight rocks from each team have been delivered, a total of sixteen stones If the teams are tied at the end of regulation, often extra ends are played to break the tie The winner is the team with the highest score after all ends have been completed (see Scoring below) A game may be conceded if winning the game is infeasible.\n\n\nDelivery\nThe process of sliding a stone down the sheet is known as the delivery or throw Players, with the exception of the skip, take turns throwing and sweeping; when one player (e.g., the lead) throws, the players not delivering (the second and third) sweep (see Sweeping, below) When the skip throws, the vice-skip takes their role.\n\n\nSweeping\nAfter the stone is delivered, its trajectory is influenced by the two sweepers under instruction from the skip Sweeping is done for several reasons: to make the stone travel further, to decrease the amount of curl, and to clean debris from the stone's path [55] Sweeping is able to make the stone travel further and straighter by slightly melting the ice under the brooms, thus decreasing the friction as the stone travels across that part of the ice The stones curl more as they slow down, so sweeping early in travel tends to increase distance as well as straighten the path, and sweeping after sideways motion is established can increase the sideways distance.\n\n\nBurning a stone\nOccasionally, players may accidentally touch a stone with their broom or a body part This is often referred to as burning a stone Players touching a stone in such a manner are expected to call their own infraction as a matter of good sportsmanship Touching a stationary stone when no stones are in motion (there is no delivery in progress) is not an infraction as long as the stone is struck in such a manner that its position is not altered, and this is a common way for the skip to indicate a stone that is to be taken out.\n\n\nTypes of shots\nMany different types of shots are used to carefully place stones for strategic or tactical reasons; they fall into three fundamental categories as follows:\n\n\nFree guard zone\nThe free guard zone is the area of the curling sheet between the hog line and tee line, excluding the house Until five stones have been played (three from the side without hammer and two from the side with hammer), stones in the free guard zone may not be removed by an opponent's stone, although they can be moved within the playing area If a stone in the free guard zone is knocked out of play, it is placed back in the position it was in before the shot was thrown and the opponent's stone is removed from play This rule is known as the five-rock rule or the free guard zone rule (previous versions of the free guard zone rule only limited removing guards from play in the first three or four rocks) [57]\n\n\nHammer\nThe last rock in an end is called the hammer, and throwing the hammer gives a team a tactical advantage Before the game, teams typically decide who gets the hammer in the first end either by chance (such as a coin toss), by a \"draw-to-the-button\" contest, where a representative of each team shoots to see who gets closer to the centre of the rings, or, particularly in tournament settings like the Winter Olympics, by a comparison of each team's win–loss record In all subsequent ends, the team that did not score in the preceding end gets to throw second, thus having the hammer In the event that neither team scores, called a blanked end, the hammer remains with the same team Naturally, it is easier to score points with the hammer than without; the team with the hammer generally tries to score two or more points If only one point is possible, the skip may try to avoid scoring at all in order to retain the hammer the next end, giving the team another chance to use the hammer advantage to try to score two points Scoring without the hammer is commonly referred to as stealing, or a steal, and is much more difficult.\n\n\nStrategy\nCurling is a game of strategy, tactics, and skill The strategy depends on the team's skill, the opponent's skill, the conditions of the ice, the score of the game, how many ends remain and whether the team has last-stone advantage (the hammer) A team may play an end aggressively or defensively Aggressive playing will put a lot of stones in play by throwing mostly draws; this makes for an exciting game and although risky the rewards can be great Defensive playing will throw a lot of hits preventing a lot of stones in play; this tends to be less exciting and less risky A good drawing team will usually opt to play aggressively, while a good hitting team will opt to play defensively.\n\n\nConceding a game\nIt is common at any level for a losing team to terminate the match before all ends are completed if it believes it no longer has a realistic chance of winning Competitive games end once the losing team has \"run out of rocks\"—that is, once it has fewer stones in play and available for play than the number of points needed to tie the game.\n\n\nDispute resolution\nMost decisions about rules are left to the skips, although in official tournaments, decisions may be left to the officials However, all scoring disputes are handled by the vice skip No players other than the vice skip from each team should be in the house while score is being determined In tournament play, the most frequent circumstance in which a decision has to be made by someone other than the vice skip is the failure of the vice skips to agree on which stone is closest to the button An independent official (supervisor at Canadian and World championships) then measures the distances using a specially designed device that pivots at the centre of the button When no independent officials are available, the vice skips measure the distances.\n\n\nScoring\nThe winner is the team having the highest number of accumulated points at the completion of ten ends Points are scored at the conclusion of each of these ends as follows: when each team has thrown its eight stones, the team with the stone closest to the button wins that end; the winning team is then awarded one point for each of its own stones lying closer to the button than the opponent's closest stone.\n\n\nCulture\nCompetition teams are normally named after the skip, for example, Team Martin after skip Kevin Martin Amateur league players can (and do) creatively name their teams, but when in competition (a bonspiel) the official team will have a standard name.\n\n\nGood sportsmanship\nMore so than in many other team sports, good sportsmanship, often referred to as the \"Spirit of Curling\", is an integral part of curling The Spirit of Curling also leads teams to congratulate their opponents for making a good shot, strong sweeping, or spectacular form Perhaps most importantly, the Spirit of Curling dictates that one never cheers mistakes, misses, or gaffes by one's opponent (unlike most team sports), and one should not celebrate one's own good shots during the game beyond modest acknowledgement of the shot such as a head nod, fist bump, or thumbs-up gesture Modest congratulation, however, may be exchanged between winning team members after the match On-the-ice celebration is usually reserved for the winners of a major tournament after winning the final game of the championship It is completely unacceptable to attempt to throw opposing players off their game by way of negative comment, distraction, or heckling [78]\n\n\nAccessibility\nCurling has been adapted for wheelchair users and people otherwise unable to throw the stone from the hack These curlers may use a device known as a \"delivery stick\" The cue holds on to the handle of the stone and is then pushed along by the curler At the end of delivery, the curler pulls back on the cue, which releases it from the stone [80] The Canadian Curling Association Rules of Curling allows the use of a delivery stick in club play, but does not permit it in championships.\n\n\nTerminology\nTerms used to describe the game include:\n\n\nChampions and major championships\n\n\nNotable clubs\n\n\nIn popular culture\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

the area south of Chernihiv [191]\n\n\nOperations in other northern regions\nA column of Russian military vehicles crossed the international border at the Bachivsk  [uk] checkpoint in the Sumy Oblast around 5:00 on 24 February [198] [77] Units of Ukraine's 58th Motorized Brigade engaged the Russians outside the city of Hlukhiv, halting the column [198] [199] The Ukrainian military claimed to have neutralized the column outside of Hlukhiv using Javelin anti-tank missiles, [200] [201] but by 14:30 on 24 February, the governor of the Sumy Oblast acknowledged that Russian forces were in control of the entire length of the Kyiv-Moscow highway in the Sumy Oblast, up until Baturyn in the Chernihiv Oblast [202] [203]\n\n\nStalemate (11–15 March)\nBy early March, Russian advances along the west side of the Dnieper were limited, after setbacks from Ukrainian defences [73] [74] As of 5 March, a large Russian convoy, reportedly 64 kilometres (40 mi) in length, had made little progress toward Kyiv [273] The London-based think tank Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) assessed Russian advances from the north and east as \"stalled\" [274] Advances along the Chernihiv axis had largely halted as a siege there began By 11 March, it was reported that the lengthy convoy had largely dispersed, taking up positions under tree cover Rocket launchers were also identified [275]\n\n\nUkrainian counteroffensive (16 March – 4 April)\nOn 16 March, the Ukrainian government announced that its forces had begun a counter-offensive to repel Russian forces approaching Kyiv Fighting took place in Bucha, Hostomel, and Irpin [300] Russian forces conducted only limited attacks northwest of Kyiv [301]\n\n\nAftermath\nAfter Ukraine had fully retaken Kyiv Oblast, its military began to mop up pockets of isolated Russian troops who had been left behind in the retreat The Institute for the Study of War assessed that these remnant groups did not offer organized resistance The Institute for the Study of War also said that some of the Russian units that were pulled back to Belarus and western Russia would \"remain combat ineffective for a protracted period\" [338]\n\n\nHumanitarian situation and war crimes\nUkrainian authorities said that more than 300 civilian inhabitants of Bucha had been summarily executed in what would be known as the Bucha massacre The bodies were discovered after the Russians withdrew [360] In total, 458 civilian deaths were recorded in Bucha, [361] [362] along with 1,300 deaths in Russian-occupied areas of Kyiv Oblast [363]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The company is headquartered in Los Gatos, California, and is the world's largest subscription-based streaming service. Netflix has revolutionized the way people consume media, offering a vast library of content, including TV shows, movies, documentaries, and original content.\n\n**History**\n\n**Launch as a mail-based rental business (1997–2006)**\n\nNetflix was founded on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California. Marc Randolph and Reed Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, were the co-founders of the company. Randolph had previously worked as a marketing director for Pure Software and was a co-founder of MicroWarehouse, a computer mail-order company. Hastings was a co-founder of Pure Software and had previously worked at several other companies.\n\nThe initial business model of Netflix was to provide a mail-based DVD rental service. Customers would select DVDs from a vast library and receive them by mail. The DVDs would be returned to Netflix, and the next DVD would be shipped to the customer. This service was launched in 1998 and was initially called \"Netflix DVD.\"\n\n**Transition to streaming services (2007–2012)**\n\nIn January 2007, Netflix launched a streaming media service, introducing video on demand via the Internet. The service was initially available only in the United States and offered a limited selection of movies and TV shows. However, the service quickly gained popularity, and by 2010, Netflix had expanded its streaming service to include a vast library of content.\n\nThe transition to streaming services was a significant shift for Netflix. The company had to invest heavily in infrastructure and technology to support the streaming service. Additionally, Netflix had to navigate the complex world of content licensing, negotiating deals with studios and content providers to offer a vast library of content.\n\n**Development of original programming and distribution expansion (2013–2017)**\n\nIn 2011, Netflix began its efforts into original content development. The company made a straight-to-series order for the political drama \"House of Cards,\" led by Kevin Spacey.

The entire first season was released on February 8, 2012.\n\n**Expansion into international productions and new productions (2017–2020)**\n\nIn November 2017, Netflix announced that it would be making its first original Colombian series, to be executive produced by Ciro Guerra.

For larger ISPs with over 100,000 subscribers, Netflix offers free Netflix Open Connect computer appliances that cache their content within the ISPs' data centers or networks to further reduce Internet transit costs.\n\n**API**\n\nOn October 1, 2008, Netflix offered access to its service via a public application programming interface (API). It allowed access to data for all Netflix titles, and allows users to manage their movie queues. The API was free and allowed commercial use. In June 2012, Netflix began to restrict the availability of its public API. Netflix instead focused on a small number of known partners using private interfaces, since most traffic came from those private interfaces. In November 2014, Netflix retired the public API. Netflix then partnered with the developers of eight services deemed the most valuable, including Instant Watcher, Fanhattan, Yidio, and Nextguide.\n\n**Recommendations and thumbnails**\n\nNetflix presents viewers with recommendations based on interactions with the service, such as previous viewing history and ratings of viewed content. These are often grouped into genres and formats, or feature the platform's highest-rated content. Each title is presented with a thumbnail. Before around 2015, these were the same key art for everyone, but since then, has been customized. Netflix may select a specific key art for a thumbnail based on viewing history, such as an actor or scene type based on genre preferences. Some thumbnails are generated from video stills.\n\n**Awards**\n\nOn July 18, 2013, Netflix earned the first Primetime Emmy Awards nominations for original streaming programs at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Three of its series, Arrested Development, Hemlock Grove, and House of Cards, earned a combined 14 nominations (nine for House of Cards, three for Arrested Development, and two for Hemlock Grove). The House of Cards episode \"Chapter 1\" received four nominations for both the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards and 65th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, becoming the first episode of a streaming television series to receive a major Primetime Emmy Award nomination. With its win for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series, \"Chapter 1\" became the first episode from a streaming service to be awarded an Emmy. David Fincher's win for Directing for a Drama Series for House of Cards made the episode the first from a streaming service to win a Primetime Emmy.\n\n**Criticism**\n\nNetflix has been subject to criticism from various groups and individuals as its popularity and market reach increased in the 2010s. In 2019, Netflix faced pressure to stop filming in Northern Ireland in light of the country's strict abortion laws.\n\n**See also**\n\nThe article is now complete.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Netflix\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nLaunch as a mail-based rental business (1997–2006)\nNetflix was founded by Marc Randolph and Reed Hastings on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, was a co-founder of Pure Software, which was acquired by Rational Software that year for

Ghost ships have been reported throughout history and across different cultures, with varying explanations for their existence. This article provides an overview of the concept of ghost ships, including folklore, legends, and historically attested examples.\n\n**Chronology**\n\nThe concept of ghost ships has been present in human culture for thousands of years. One of the earliest recorded examples is the _Mary Celeste_, which was found adrift in 1872 with no signs of its crew on board. The ship was in good condition, with no signs of damage or struggle, and all of its sails were set as if the crew had just left the ship.\n\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, there were several reports of ghost ships in the North Atlantic. Many of these ships were found with no signs of their crews, and some were even found with their sails still set. One of the most famous examples is the _Ourang Medan_, a ship that was said to have been discovered in the 1940s with no signs of its crew on board.\n\nIn recent years, there have been several reported sightings of ghost ships. In 2018, a Chinese fishing boat was found adrift in the Indian Ocean with no signs of its crew on board. The ship was in good condition, and all of its sails were set as if the crew had just left the ship.\n\n**Folklore, Legends, and Mythology**\n\nGhost ships have been a part of folklore and mythology for thousands of years. In many cultures, ghost ships are seen as omens or harbingers of doom. In ancient Greece, for example, ghost ships were said to be the spirits of sailors who had died at sea. These spirits were believed to haunt the ships and sailors, causing them to become lost or stranded.\n\nIn Norse mythology, ghost ships were said to be the _Fenrisúlfr_, a giant wolf that was said to roam the seas and devour sailors. The _Fenrisúlfr_ was believed to be a ghost ship that was crewed by the spirits of dead sailors.\n\nIn many Asian cultures, ghost ships are seen as a sign of good luck. In Japan, for example, ghost ships are believed to be the spirits of sailors who have died at sea and are now serving as guides for other sailors.\n\n**Unsubstantiated**\n\nThere are many reported sightings of ghost ships that are unsubstantiated. These sightings are often anecdotal and may be exaggerated or distorted over time. Some of the most famous unsubstantiated sightings include:\n\n* The _Flying Dutchman_, a ghost ship that is said to haunt the seas and is often associated with the ghost of a Dutch sailor who died at sea.\n* The _Ghosts of the Mary Rose_, a ghost ship that is said to haunt the waters of the English Channel and is associated with the spirit of the crew of the _Mary Rose_.\n* The _Ghost Ship of the Carolinas_, a ghost ship that is said to haunt the waters of the Carolinas and is associated with the spirit of a sailor who died at sea.\n\nThese sightings are often based on folklore and mythology, and may be exaggerated or distorted over time. They provide a glimpse into the cultural and historical context of ghost ships, but should be treated with skepticism.\n\n**Historically Attested**\n\nThere are several historically attested examples of ghost ships that are well-documented. Some of the most famous examples include:\n\n* The _Mary Celeste_, a ship that was found adrift in 1872 with no signs of its crew on board.\n* The _Ourang Medan_, a ship that was said to have been discovered in the 1940s with no signs of its crew on board.\n* The _Ryou-Un Maru_, a Japanese fishing boat that was found adrift in 2007 with no signs of its crew on board.\n\nThese ships were all found in good condition, with no signs of damage or struggle, and all of their sails were set as if the crew had just left the ship. They provide a glimpse into the mystery of ghost ships, and highlight the importance of investigation and evidence-based research.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* _Mary Celeste_\n* _Ourang Medan_\n* _Ryou-Un Maru_\n* _Ghost Ships of the North Atlantic_\n* _Folklore and Mythology of the Sea_\n\n**External Links**\n\n* National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) - Ghost Ships\n* _Mary Celeste_ Museum\n* _Ourang Medan_ - The Mysterious Ship\n* _Ryou-Un Maru_ - The Japanese Ghost Ship", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ghost_ship\" following this outline:\n\n\nChronology\n\n\nFolklore, legends, and mythology\n\n\nUnsubstantiated\n\n\nHistorically attested\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is a critical event in American politics, as it determines the composition of the House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe midterm election is an integral part of the United States' electoral system, as it provides an opportunity for citizens to hold their elected representatives accountable. The election is a significant event in American politics, as it influences the balance of power in Congress and can have far-reaching consequences for the country's governance. In this article, we will explore the background, historical record, and significance of the United States midterm election.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe United States Constitution sets the framework for elections in the country. Article II, Section 1, Clause 1 establishes the president's term of office as four years. However, the Constitution also sets different term lengths for members of Congress. Article I, Section 2, Clause 1 states that members of the House of Representatives are elected for a two-year term, while Article I, Section 3, Clause 1 establishes a six-year term for members of the Senate. Additionally, Clause 2 of Article I, Section 3 divides the Senate into three classes, so that approximately one-third of the seats are up for election every two years.\n\nThe midterm election is a critical event in American politics, as it determines the composition of the House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate. The election is often seen as a referendum on the sitting president's and/or incumbent party's performance. The election can also have significant implications for the country's governance, as it can influence the balance of power in Congress and shape the legislative agenda.\n\n**Historical Record of Midterm**\n\nMidterm elections have a long history in the United States, dating back to the early years of the country's independence. The first midterm election was held in 1794, and it was a significant event in American politics. The election was marked by a major shift in the balance of power in Congress, as the Democratic-Republican Party gained control of the House of Representatives.\n\nThroughout history, midterm elections have been a critical event in American politics. They have often been seen as a referendum on the sitting president's and/or incumbent party's performance. The election can also have significant implications for the country's governance, as it can influence the balance of power in Congress and shape the legislative agenda.\n\nIn recent years, midterm elections have become increasingly significant, with many considering them a bellwether for the country's politics. The 1994 midterm election, for example, saw the Republicans gain control of both the House and Senate, marking a significant shift in the balance of power in Congress. The 2006 midterm election saw the Democrats regain control of both the House and Senate, while the 2010 midterm election saw the Republicans regain control of the House of Representatives.\n\n**Comparison with Other U.S. General Elections**\n\nThe midterm election is often compared to other U.S. general elections, including presidential elections and special elections. Presidential elections are held every four years, and they are a significant event in American politics. They involve the election of the president and the vice president, as well as members of Congress.\n\nSpecial elections, on the other hand, are held to fill vacancies in Congress or other federal offices. They are often seen as a test of the strength of the parties, and they can have significant implications for the country's governance.\n\nIn contrast to presidential elections, midterm elections are often seen as a referendum on the sitting president's and/or incumbent party's performance. Midterm elections are also often seen as a test of the strength of the parties, and they can have significant implications for the country's governance.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe midterm election is a critical event in American politics, as it determines the composition of the House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate. The election is often seen as a referendum on the sitting president's and/or incumbent party's performance, and it can have significant implications for the country's governance.\n\nIn conclusion, the United States midterm election is a critical event in American politics, with significant implications for the country's governance. The election is often seen as a referendum on the sitting president's and/or incumbent party's performance, and it can shape the legislative agenda and influence the balance of power in Congress.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Federal Election Commission: Midterm Election Information\n* Congressional Research Service: Midterm Elections: A Guide to the Issues\n* National Archives: United States Constitution", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"United_States_midterm_election\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nWhile Article II, Section 1, Clause 1 of the United States Constitution sets the U.S president's term of office to four years, Article I, Section 2, Clause 1 sets a two-year term for congressmembers elected to the U.S House of Representatives Article I, Section 3, Clause 1 then sets a six-year term for those elected to the U.S Senate, with Clause 2 dividing the chamber into three \"classes\" so that approximately one-third of those seats are up for election every two years [5]\n\n\nHistorical record of midterm\nMidterm elections are regarded as a referendum on the sitting president's and/or incumbent party's performance [7] [8]\n\n\nComparison with other U.S. general elections\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Royal_Commission_on_Animal_Magnetism", "content": "\nReasons for the investigation\nAccording to Armando & Belhoste (2018, pp. 6–8), the true history of Mesmer, of Mesmer's version of 'animal magnetism', and of the rationale, conduct, investigations, experimentation, and findings of the 1784 Royal Commissions has been seriously distorted by the modern (\"cherry picking\") concentration upon \"the transformations of animal magnetism after 1820  [in relation to] hypnotism\", [14] and, especially, upon \"the elements of continuity and analogy between mesmerism  [sic] the various versions of psychoanalysis\" [15]\n\n\nTensions within the Royal family\nPrior to his arrival in Paris in 1777 – with a letter of recommendation from Chancellor von Kaunitz of the Habsburg monarchy to the Austrian Ambassador to France, the Comte de Mercy-Argenteau (who, in turn, introduced Mesmer to Jean-Baptiste Le Roy (1720–1800), the Director of the Academy of Sciences) – Mesmer was already known to Marie Antoinette [16]\n\n\nSocial impact\nMesmer's overall stress on the quest for \"harmony\" as a therapeutic outcome and, especially, given the demonstrated fact that the effects of his 'animal magnetism' – predicated upon the presence of a force analogous to gravity – were equally demonstrated by all, regardless of age, gender, class, race, intellect, etc., [20] was an important influence on many of the moves (and 'movers') within French society towards democracy and greater equality [21] [22]\n\n\nFestering political issues\nThe increasingly unpopular \"Ancien Régime\" was under considerable pressure from many quarters; and, within five years of the Commissions' Reports, the French Revolution had broken out The storming of the Bastille took place on 14 July 1789; and four years later, King Louis XVI was executed on 21 January 1793, and his Queen, Marie Antoinette, the  daughter of Empress Maria Theresa, and the sister  of Emperor Joseph II, was executed on 16 October 1793.\n\n\nProfessional tensions\nApart from the wider issue of having to evaluate and decide how to deal with those within the medical profession \"who saw animal magnetism as an interesting therapeutic resource\" (Armando & Belmonte, 2018, p. 13) – namely, the boundary disputes between the conventional therapeutic practices of the sorts that Brockliss and Jones (1997) usefully identify as lying within the established \"medical penumbra\" (pp. 230–283) and the novel and innovative practices at the \"frontier\" that were (potentially) responsible for the \"expansion of the medicable\" (pp. 441–459) – there were also significant tensions, differences, and boundary disputes between the more theory- and principle-centred Paris Faculty of Medicine (formed some five centuries earlier), and the more practitioner-centred Royal Society of Medicine (formed just 5 years earlier), the \"primary function\" of which was \"to evaluate patent medicines and, by extension, new forms of therapy\" (Forrest, 1999, pp. 18–19).\n\n\nScientific issues\nIn a prevailing atmosphere of \" [an overall] redefinition of frontiers in the legitimacy of knowledge\" – and, in relation to Mesmer's claims, a redefinition \"which did not necessarily match the public popularity that they attracted\" (Zanetti, 2018), p. 59) – the issue of the existence (or not) of a substantial \"magnetic fluid\" and/or \"animal magnetism\" required resolution.\n\n\nMedical issues\nAt a time when, in relation to \"healers and healing\", the conglomerate of \"physicians, empirics, surgeons, apothecaries, folk healers, and religious personalities all vied with each other (as well as worked together) for medical legitimacy and patients\" (Broomhall, 2004, p. 5), Mesmer was not only a \"foreign national\", [23] [24] but also one that had no affiliation of any kind with any known professional medical association within France (or elsewhere in Europe); and, as a consequence, his professional conduct, his medical practice, his medico-commercial enterprises, and his therapeutic endeavours were not regulated in any way.\n\n\nReligious issues\nAs discussed at considerable length by Spanos and Gottlieb (1979) there were not only a wide range of controversial secular and religious issues relating to the similarities and differences between the induction, manifestations, and immediate and long-term consequences of the \"crises\" that were (sporadically) produced by the 'magnetic' interventions, and the exorcisms of the Roman Catholic Church, but, also, of greater significance, to the occasional (apparently veridical) reports of post-magnetic \"clairvoyance\" [25] – a condition that was one of the classic indications for an exorcism whenever it was considered to be \"demonically inspired\" (as distinct from those cases in which it was considered to be \"divinely inspired\" (Spanos and Gottlieb, 1979, p. 538)) [26] [27] [28]\n\n\nThe two Commissions\nThe Commissions were appointed in early 1784 by the Baron de Breteuil, Secretary of State for the King's Household and Minister of the Department of Paris at the command of King Louis XVI [29]\n\n\n\"Franklin Commission\"\nThe first of the two Royal Commissions, usually referred to as the \"Franklin Commission\", was appointed on 12 March 1784.\n\n\n\"Society Commission\"\nThe second of the two Royal Commissions, usually referred to as the \"Society Commission\", was appointed on 5 April 1784.\n\n\nFranz Mesmer\nFranz Anton Mesmer (1734–1815), born in Swabia, having first studied law at Dillingen and Ingolstadt universities, transferred to the University of Vienna and began a study of medicine, graduating Medicinae Doctor (M.D.) at the age of 32, in 1766: his doctoral dissertation (Mesmer, 1766) had the official title A Physico-Medical Dissertation on the Influence of the Planets [46] [47] [48]\n\n\nPositioner of a concept\nRather than being the \"inventor\" of \"a technique\", as some (mis)represent the circumstances, it is clear that Mesmer's significance was in his \"positioning\" of an overarching \"concept\" (or \"construct\") through his creation and development – using analogies with gravity, terrestrial magnetism, and hydraulics (as they were understood at the time) – of \"an explanatory model to represent the way that healers had been healing people for thousands of years\" (Yeates, 2018, p. 48) [51] [52]\n\n\nMesmer's \"protoscience\", rather than \"pseudoscience\"\nAccording to Tatar (1990, p. 49), rather than Mesmer's proposal being some sort of \"occult theory\", \" [Mesmer] actually remained well within the bounds of eighteenth-century thought when he formulated his theories\" and \"the theories  [that Mesmer] invoked to explain  [the agency of \"animal magnetism\"] fit squarely into the frame of eighteenth-century cosmology\": and, moreover, \"to consider animal magnetism independently of the tradition out of which it emerged is to magnify its distinctively occult characteristics and to diminish in importance those features that mirror the scientific and philosophical temper of the age in which it flourished.\"\n\n\nA concept that must not be reified\nIt is clear from his Mémoire (1799) that Mesmer was very aware of the human propensity – in the normal, conventional use of language (la langue de convention) – to speak of \"properties\" or \"qualities\" (i.e., these \"metaphysical abstractions\",  illusions de la méthaphysique), as if they were \"substances\": in Mesmer's words, \"substantivise the properties\", substantisia les propriétés (Mesmer 1799, pp. 15–17) [59] — in other words, \"reification\", in the manner of Whitehead's \"fallacy of misplaced concreteness\" [60]\n\n\nBased on natural principles\nMesmer held the materialist position – that his therapies, which involved easily understood, systematic natural principles, were \"physiological\", rather than \"psychological\" interventions [62] – in contrast to the supernatural positions of, say, the exorcist Johann Joseph Gassner (1727–1779), [63]\n\n\nCharles d'Eslon\nCharles-Nicolas d’Eslon (1750–1786)  [fr], \"a disciple of the  [eminent French] surgeon J.L Petit\", [68] was a docteur-régent of the Paris Faculty of Medicine, and the one-time personal physician to the King's brother, Charles Philippe, Comte d’Artois – who, later (following the Bourbon Restoration in France) became King Charles X.\n\n\nAssociation with Mesmer\nd’Eslon, a one-time patient, pupil, and associate of Mesmer, [69] published a work on Mesmer's version of animal magnetism (while still associated with Mesmer), Observations sur le Magnétisme Animal (1780), [70] which presented details of 18 cases (10 male, 8 female) treated by Mesmer [71]\n\n\nOstracism\nOn 7 October 1780 – still associated with Mesmer and still a member of the Paris Faculty of Medicine – d'Eslon made an official request \"that an investigation of the authenticity and efficacy of Mesmer's claims and cures be made The Faculté rejected his plea, and in refusing accused  [d'Eslon] personally of misdemeanour\" [74]\n\n\nPost-Mesmer\nIn late 1782, and eighteen months before the Royal Commission, d'Eslon had (acrimoniously) parted ways with Mesmer; and, despite a brief reconciliation, the relationship was terminated in late 1783 On 28 December 1783, d'Eslon wrote a letter to the Journal de Paris, which not only described the difficulties he had experienced with Mesmer, but also announced that he was opening his own (entirely independent) clinic [77]\n\n\nLast days\nOnce d'Eslon had been expelled from the rank of docteur-régent, his membership of the Faculty of Medicine was never reinstated; and unlike Mesmer, he remained in Paris following the publication of the reports of the two Commissions Although apparently in good health in the preceding months, he died somewhat suddenly in Paris, on 21 August 1786, at the age of 47, [82] from a complex of disorders including pneumonia, a malignant fever (une fièvre maligne), and renal colic [83]\n\n\nAspects of Mesmer's evolving practices\nIt is significant that Mesmer, initially impressed by the therapeutic enterprises of the Jesuit astronomer, explorer, and healer Maximilian Hell (1720–1792) – which involved the application of steel magnets that had been specifically shaped either to fit particular body contours, or to match the actual dimensions of a specific organ (e.g., the liver) [84] – and, immediately recognizing the \"prima facie plausibility\" [85] of Hell's approach, purchased a number of steel magnets from Hell in 1774 and began applying them to his patients; however, as Pattie reports (1994, p. 2), Mesmer \"had  [entirely] abandoned the use of magnets\" by 1776, [86] because his own clinical experimentation had proved them to be utterly useless.\n\n\nMesmer's early experiments with magnets\nIt is significant that Mesmer, initially impressed by the therapeutic enterprises of the Jesuit astronomer, explorer, and healer Maximilian Hell (1720–1792) – which involved the application of steel magnets that had been specifically shaped either to fit particular body contours, or to match the actual dimensions of a specific organ (e.g., the liver) [84] – and, immediately recognizing the \"prima facie plausibility\" [85] of Hell's approach, purchased a number of steel magnets from Hell in 1774 and began applying them to his patients; however, as Pattie reports (1994, p. 2), Mesmer \"had  [entirely] abandoned the use of magnets\" by 1776, [86] because his own clinical experimentation had proved them to be utterly useless.\n\n\nThe glass armonica\nMesmer developed particular theatrical therapeutic rituals, often accompanied by the sounds of the Glass Armonica [88] [89] – an instrument invented by Benjamin Franklin himself [90] [91]  – that were associated with a wide range of (figurative) magnetic connotations, such as the use of \"magnetic wands\", and the treatment tub known as \"the baquet\", which, in the view of Yeates (2018, p. 48), were \"obviously, designed to amplify each subject's \"response expectancy\" (Kirsch, 1997, etc.) via impressive \"metonymical acts\" (Topley, 1976, p. 254)\".\n\n\nThe \"baquet\"\nThe \"baquet\" (lit 'a tub') was a device of Mesmer's design, that he had constructed by analogy with the newly invented \"Leyden Bottle\" – i.e., \"the first electric condenser  [viz., capacitor] in history\" (Morabito, 2019, p. 90) – which was \"supposed by analogy to 'store' animal magnetism\" (Forrest, 1999, p. 20) [93]\n\n\nThe \"magnetic crisis\"\nGiven Mesmer's regular (analogical) references throughout his works to the efficient grinding activities of smoothly functioning mills – speaking of how the windmills are driven by the wind, and watermills by the flow of water [98] – he usefully extended those analogies to explain the circumstances in which \"crises\" occur, especially in relation to the magnitude of the \"crises\": i.e., the dramatic circumstances of the sudden restoration of the lost function of a watermill installation – a direct consequence of the magnitude of the force of the flow of water that has been applied (through the currently stationary waterwheel) to the milling mechanism, which is, in and of itself, directly related to the extent to which the (now-operative) milling mechanism was formerly stationary, out of order, or, even, jammed:\n\n\nThe Commissions' observations and description of d'Eslon's \"magnetic crises\"\nNoting that some of those who were \"magnetized\" by d'Eslon over an extended time \"fell into the convulsive movements that have been called Crises\" – and noting that these \"convulsive movements\" (mouvemens convulsifs) were \"viewed  [by d'Eslon] as evidence of the particular agent to whom they are attributed\" – the \"Society\" Commissioners' Report, in its discussion of the \"Crises\", [102] identified a number of common characteristics among the majority of those who displayed these \"convulsive movements\": [103]\n\n\nThe Commissions' remarks on d'Eslon's \"magnetic crises\"\nNoting that some of those who were \"magnetized\" by d'Eslon over an extended time \"fell into the convulsive movements that have been called Crises\" – and noting that these \"convulsive movements\" (mouvemens convulsifs) were \"viewed  [by d'Eslon] as evidence of the particular agent to whom they are attributed\" – the \"Society\" Commissioners' Report, in its discussion of the \"Crises\", [102] identified a number of common characteristics among the majority of those who displayed these \"convulsive movements\": [103]\n\n\nThe Commissions' remarks on the perceived dangers of the \"magnetic crises\"\nIn the last section of its Report, the \"Franklin\" Commission, in addition to its remarks on the impact of the phenomena associated with a \"crisis\", made a number of significant observations on the perceived dangers of experiencing, or simply observing, a \"crisis\" in a number of domains, including:\n\n\nObservations of the frequency of \"crises\"\nOne interesting aspect of a number of the pro-d'Eslon and pro-Mesmer responses to the Commissions' Reports, collectively, was that they provided figures on the level to which the author in question had observed individual patients manifest full-blown \"magnetic crises\" as a consequence of their exposure to an extended sequence of standard \"magnetic\" treatments.\n\n\n\"Mesmerism\" vs. \"Animal Magnetism\"\nIn order to understand the significance of the two Commissions' concentration on their examination of d'Eslons' claims for the existence of \"animal magnetism\" (rather than, that is, conducting an examination of the clinical efficacy of Mesmer's actual therapeutic practices) – and, in order to clarify certain ambiguities, and correct particular errors that persist in the literature – a number of basic facts need to be addressed (see, for example, Yeates, 2018, pp. 48–52), it is useful to isolate what later, subsequent to the publication of Wolfart's Mesmerismus (1814), became known as \"Mesmerism\" from other \"animal magnetism\" practices in general.\n\n\nSimilarities and differences\nThe materialist \"mesmerists\" and the metaphysical \"animal magnetists\" each held that all animate beings (i.e., \"living\" beings: humans, animals, plants, etc.), in virtue of being alive, possessed an invisible, natural \"magnetic\" or \"gravitational force\" – thus magnetismus animalis, \"animal magnetism\", or gravitas animalis, \"animal gravity\" [112] – and the therapeutic interventions of each were directed at manipulating the ebb and flow of their subject's \"energy field\".\n\n\nThe \"mesmerists\"\nIn order to foster and promote orthopraxia, [114] the materialist \"mesmerists\" used qualitative (rather than quantitative) constructs – centred on Mesmer's abstract and metaphorical overarching analogies with gravity, terrestrial magnetism, and hydraulics – to explain the application of their techniques and to describe their therapeutic rationale.\n\n\nThe \"animal magnetists\"\nIn contrast to the mesmerists, the metaphysical \"magnetists\" – who (mistakenly) reified (i.e., \"substantivised\") the magnetic/fluidic metaphors of Mesmer – firmly believed that they were channeling a substantial \"fluidium\" and were manipulating a particular, substantial \"force\" [115]\n\n\nThe \"higher\" and \"lower\" phenomena of the magnetists\nBy the time of James Braid's (1841) Manchester encounter with the \"magnetic demonstrator\" Charles Lafontaine, [118] those who were still committed to the existence of a substantial 'magnetic fluid\", etc., maintained that the phenomena produced by their acts of \"magnetization\" were of two general classes – lower phenomena, [119] and higher phenomena [120] – the distinction being \"that, while there might be natural explanations for 'lower' phenomena, 'higher' phenomena could only be explained in terms of a paranormal or metaphysical agency\" (Yeates, 2018, p. 52).\n\n\nThe investigations\nRather than being concerned with the applications, utility, and clinical efficacy of d'Eslon's \"animal magnetism\", the primary concern of each Commission was the significant, crucial, and exclusive question of whether or not d'Eslon's (supposed) \"animal magnetic fluid\" actually existed in some substantial physical way – for the simple reason that, as the two sets of Commissioners each noted in their independent reports, \"Animal magnetism may well exist without being useful but it cannot be useful if it does not exist.\" [121]\n\n\nThe substantial existence of \"animal magnetism\" and \"magnetic fluid\" were investigated\nRather than being concerned with the applications, utility, and clinical efficacy of d'Eslon's \"animal magnetism\", the primary concern of each Commission was the significant, crucial, and exclusive question of whether or not d'Eslon's (supposed) \"animal magnetic fluid\" actually existed in some substantial physical way – for the simple reason that, as the two sets of Commissioners each noted in their independent reports, \"Animal magnetism may well exist without being useful but it cannot be useful if it does not exist.\" [121]\n\n\nMesmer's earlier refusal to have his \"magnetic\" interventions scrutinized\nAlready, in his earlier (18 September 1780) interaction with the Paris Faculty of Medicine, Mesmer had refused to have his therapeutic interventions on a set of entirely \"new\" patients directly scrutinized, claiming that his already-achieved \"cures\" were an objective matter of record [122] Mesmer justified his refusal as follows:\n\n\nMesmer's \"cures\" were never investigated\nIn relation to the question of the agency/cause of Mesmer's supposed \"cures\" – and in the process of constructing the protocols for their investigations into d'Eslon's \"animal magnetism\" – both Commissions were well aware that \"an effect's objective reality does not substantiate  [any of the] proffered explanations  [for its existence]\" (Yeates, 2018, p. 61) [125]\n\n\nThe efficacy of \"magnetic\" treatments and the agency of (supposed) \"magnetic\" cures were not investigated\nThe two Reports also (separately, and in some detail) explained why the nature of the \"effects\" of (supposedly efficacious) treatments were not being examined, and why the agency of the (supposed verified) \"cures\" were not being investigated.\n\n\nProblems with objectively determining the precise agency of any supposed \"cure\"\nThe Commissioners (Bailly, 1784, p. 15) stressed that, because they had been specifically charged with determining whether (or not) d'Eslon's \"magnetic fluid\" actually existed in some substantial form, and because it was obvious that, in order to unequivocally settle the \"uncertain\" and \"misleading\" issue of whether there were real \"cures\" of \"real\" diseases from d'Eslon's therapeutic interventions, and whether any such \"cures\" were entirely the \"effects\" of d'Eslon's treatment, and nothing else  – and even if the Commissioners were able \"to strip from these therapeutic effects all of the illusions which might be involved with them\" [131] – any such determination would require an \"infinity of cures\", supported by the \"experience of several centuries\" And, further, given the specified goal of the commission, the significance of whatever its findings might be, and the obligation to produce its Report \"promptly\", the Commissioners considered that,\n\n\nProblems with objectively determining the precise therapeutic action of any supposed \"efficacious remedy\"\nIn support of its decision, the \"Franklin Commission\" produced a cogent, extended argument, consistent with the medical knowledge of the day, that is equally relevant to similar investigations in the present day:\n\n\nOther highly significant, but unassociated \"causative\" factors\nIn addition to reflecting the position of the \"Franklin Commission\" in these matters, the \"Society Commission\" also noted that there were other equally significant causative factors, concomitant with, but unassociated with, the treatment delivered, in relation to the circumstances of the patients themselves; namely,\n\n\nCommon misrepresentation of fact\nThe preceding facts expose the error – a classic example of equivocation due to lexical ambiguity – in the commonly expressed (in modern literature) and extremely misleading misrepresentation of affairs; namely, the (historically incorrect, and mistaken) implication that, rather than simply having, for convenience, accepted Mesmer's assertions at face value (and left it at that), both Commissions had objectively verified that:\n\n\nProcedures\nThe \"Franklin\" Commission's investigations were conducted at a number of different locations, including d’Eslon's clinic (which they visited once a week [136]), Lavoisier's home, and the gardens of Franklin's Passy residence The intricate structure and detailed procedures of the investigations were designed by Lavoisier; [137] [138] and great care was taken to eliminate what James Braid would later identify as \"sources of fallacy\" [139]\n\n\nThe Report(s) of the \"Franklin Commission\"\nThe \"Franklin Commission's\" investigations produced three separate reports.\n\n\nThe issue of d'Eslon vs. Mesmer\nAt the head of their principal report, the Commissioners directly summarize Mesmer's 27 Propositions, [149] as expounded in Mesmer's 1779 Memoire (1779, pp. 74–83) They also quote Mesmer's own \"characterization\" of his principle [150] – namely, that \"In the influence of the magnetism, Nature holds out to us a sovereign instrument for securing the health and lengthening the existence of mankind\" [151]\n\n\nThe Commission's report\nThe first (66 page) report was presented to the King on 11 August 1784 [156]\n\n\nImmediate publication and dissemination\nThe report was immediately published by the government printer; and at least 20,000 copies were rapidly and very widely circulated throughout France and neighbouring countries [158] Within four months (16 December 1784), the London publishing house of Joseph Johnson was announcing the publication of a complete English version, translated by William Godwin (i.e., Godwin, 1785), [159] [160] and, in between February and July 1785, four different \"periodical abridgements of the Franklin report, each printed multiple times in the Atlantic coast publications\" were published in the United States (Ogden, 2012, p. 167); and, in 1837, Godwin's complete translation was published, in Philadelphia, as part of a collected work [161]\n\n\nTouch, imagination, and imitation\nClearly \"recogniz [ing] that publicly endorsing the curative effects of a technique that had no demonstrable basis in the science of the late 18th century could lead to a proliferation of medical quackery\" (McConkey & Perry, 2002, p. 328) and, based on their own \"experiments\" and \"observations\", the Commissioners concluded that \"the true causes of the effects attributed to this new agent known by the name of animal magnetism,  [and] to this fluid which is said to circulate in the body and to communicate itself from one individual to another\" were \"touch, imagination,  [and] imitation\": [162] [163]\n\n\nNo evidence to support d'Eslon's claims\nThe Commission found no evidence of any kind to support d'Eslon's claim for the existence of a \"magnetic fluid\":\n\n\nThe Commission's secret report (\"for the King's eyes only\")\nA second (brief) report – which had been presented privately to the King on 11 August 1784, [166] but not made public until 1800 (i.e., in the time of The Consulate period of French First Republic) – specifically addressed the perceived moral dangers occasioned by the physical practices of the animal magnetists:\n\n\nThe Commission's brief \"courtesy report\" to the Royal Academy of Sciences\nOn 4 September 1784, Bailly presented a third, brief (15 page) courtesy report to the Royal Academy of Sciences (Bailly, 1784b) [167] on behalf of himself, Franklin, Le Roy, de Bory, and Lavoisier (i.e., those Commissioners who were also Academy members), which provided their Academy colleagues with a brief account of the commission's proceedings, the rationale behind its investigations, and the results Noting that all of their investigations were jointly conducted with the four members of the Paris Faculty, and that all nine shared the same \"interest in  [discovering] the truth\", they stressed that all the findings of their combined efforts were \"unanimous\" (p. 2).\n\n\nThe importance of \"the Sciences\"\nFurther (p. 4), given that the understanding of the Sciences – \"which  [collectively] are increased by  [establishing] the truth\" (qui s’accroissent par les vérités) – is increased by \"the suppression of error\": i.e., given that \"error\" is always \"a bad leaven that ferments and, in the long run, corrupts the mass into which it has been introduced\" By contrast, however, in those cases wherein the \"error\" has been generated by \"The Empire of Science\", and has spread to \"the multitude\" – not only to divide and agitate minds, but also, in deceptively presenting a means of curing the sick, prevent them from seeking their cures elsewhere – \"good Government has an interest in destroying it\".\n\n\nPhysics\nNoting that the \"greater\" and \"more extraordinary\" a discovery, the more difficult it was to settle on suitable proof, they reported that, as physicists, they were unable to detect the presence of d'Eslon's supposed (substantial) \"fluid\" (p. 6) From this absence of \"physical evidence\", they were forced, instead, to \"examine the affections of the spirit and the ideas of those who had been exposed to the action of 'Magnetism'\"; and, from this, ceased to be \"physicists\", and became nothing more than \"philosophers\" (p. 8).\n\n\nChemistry\nHowever, having been unable to operate as physicists, they had decided to follow the standard procedures of \"chemists\" – who, having \"decomposed substances\" and thereby discovered their \"principles\", assured themselves of the \"exactness\" of their findings by \"recomposing\" the same substances from their \"reunited\" constituents (p. 9).\n\n\nImagination\nGiven their inability to detect any (substantial) 'magnetism' – and, from their observations that the \"effects\" (that were attributed by d'Eslon to the supposed 'magnetism' and the supposed 'fluid') were only manifested when the subjects believed they were 'magnetised' (and were not manifested when they were unaware that they had been 'magnetised') – the Commissioners concluded that the \"principle\" involved was the subject's \"imagination\"; and, therefore, as a consequence of their investigations, they were well satisfied that they had been \"fully successful\" in experimentally proving that the observed \"effects\" had been produced \"by the power of the imagination alone\" (p. 9).\n\n\nThe Report(s) of the \"Society Commission\"\nThe \"Society Commission's\" investigations produced two separate reports.\n\n\nThe report of four of the five Commissioners\nThe first of the two reports, made by four of the five Commissioners (of 39 pages) – namely, Charles-Louis-François Andry, Claude-Antoine Caille, Pierre Jean Claude Mauduyt de La Varenne, and Pierre-Isaac Poissonnier – was presented to the King on 16 August 1784 [169]\n\n\nThe (later) representations of Burdin and Dubois\nAlthough the \"Society\" Commission did not directly investigate the clinical efficacy of d'Eslon's therapeutic interventions, and did not examine the circumstances of any earlier (i.e., pre-Commission) \"cures\" claimed by d\"Eslon, two members of the Royal Academy of Medicine, Charles Burdin (1778-1856) and Frédéric Dubois (1797-1873)  [fr], writing in 1841, [173] drew attention to the fact that, in the process of their (1784) investigations, the \"Society\" Commissioners identified three categories of patient treated by d'Eslon [174] – (a) those with an \"obvious ailment\" with \"a known cause\", (b) those with \"mild\" and \"vague\" ailments with no known cause, and, finally, (c) the melancholics (\"Les mélancoliques\") – and, significantly, having followed the collective progress of d'Eslon's patients over a period of four months, the Commissioners found no evidence of any kind that any members of the '(a) group' (many of whom had been receiving d'Eslon's treatment \"for more than a year\") had been \"cured\" (guéris), or, even, \"noticeably relieved\" (notablement soulagés) of their ailment [175]\n\n\nde Jussieu's \"dissenting\" report\nThe second of the two reports, made by de Jussieu alone (of 51 pages) was independently published on 17 September 1784 [176]\n\n\nResponses to the Commissions' conclusions\nThe release of the reports generated a proliferation of publications, many of which were simply addressing issues relating to either \"mesmerism\" or \"animal magnetism\" in general – such as, for instance, those of Jean-Jacques Paulet (1784), and Michel-Augustin Thouret  [fr] (1784) – while others, such as those of Charles Joseph Devillers, himself a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences – who (at Devillers, 1784, pp. 165–166) compared the \"cures\" of Mesmer, with those supposed to have been effected at the tomb of François de Pâris in Saint-Médard, some forty years earlier – and Jacques Cambry (1784) – who provided details of beliefs similar to those of Mesmer previously held by the ancient Greeks, Persians, and Romans – strongly supported the findings of the Commissions.\n\n\nResponse of the Paris Faculty of Medicine\nImmediately following the release of the reports of the two Commissions, the Paris Faculty of Medicine \"pressure [d] its own members to renounce animal magnetism\" (Crabtree, 1993, p. 32).\n\n\nd'Eslon's response\nd'Eslon immediately published an attack on the commission's reports, [184] in which he criticized their failure to investigate the longer-term effects of his treatments, and their refusal to accept his (alleged) \"cures\" as proof of the existence of \"animal magnetism\", as well as noting that, \"the commissioners' recommendation that the practice of magnetism should be prohibited    would hardly be possible  [to implement]\", because, apart from those within the medical profession who had been trained by himself and by Mesmer, \"a large number of other people had, as a result of their own study, begun to practice it\" (Pattie, 1994, p. 171) [185]\n\n\nMesmer's response\nIn his own responses to the Commissions' Reports, [197] Mesmer stressed that – simply because he had not been involved in any of their investigations – the Commissioners' conclusions had nothing whatsoever to do with his (metaphorical) \"animal magnetism\"; and, because their conclusions only applied to d'Eslon's theories and practices, any responses to those conclusions were entirely the concern of d'Eslon alone.\n\n\nThe \"Franklin\" Commissions' investigations considered to be a \"classic\" example of a controlled trial\nThe detailed studies of Stephen Jay Gould (1989) and John Kihlstrom (2002), drew disciplinary attention to nature and the form of the commission's extended examination as a watershed moment in the history of science – subsequent to which things were never the same.\n\n\nThe \"Franklin\" Commissions' legacy\nThe \"classic\" structure of the investigations undertaken by the \"Franklin\" Commission [201] inspired – among many others over the ensuing years – the (1799) investigations of Chester physician John Haygarth (1740-1827) into the efficacy of Perkins' \"tractors\" [202] [203] [204]\n\n\nFour vestiges of the magnetization-by-contact practice\nIn relation to the findings of both Commissions – viz., that there was no evidence for d'Eslon's claims, and that d'Eslon's magnetization-by-contact practices had no place within the \"medical penumbra\" – and despite the consequent, and widespread demedicalization of both d'Eslon's magnetization-by-contact and of animal magnetism in general, there remained a small number of historically significant vestigial remnants of d'Eslon's magnetization-by-contact, the boundary-work of which, for a short while, operated at the frontier of the \"medical penumbra\" (Brockliss and Jones, 1997) in the (vain) hope of producing an \"expansion of the medicable\" (such that they would be admitted to conventional medical practice), which were (later) abandoned by their original advocates.\n\n\nPhreno-magnetism\nIn 1843, Robert Hanham Collyer (1814-1891), an American physician and former pupil of John Elliotson, announced that he had discovered the existence of phreno-magnetism in November 1839; [206] and, prior to Collyer's later retraction, two others claimed to have independently confirmed the veracity of Collyer's \"discovery\": the architect, Henry George Atkinson (1812-1890), at London, in November 1841, and the chemist, Charles Blandford Mansfield (1819-1849), at Cambridge, in December 1841 [207] [208]\n\n\nThe \"zones\" of Albert Pitres\nAround 1885, the neurologist Albert Pitres – the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Bordeaux, and an associate of  Charcot at the Salpêtrière hospital – claimed that he had discovered a system of \"zones\" on the surface of the body, the stimulation of which induced (or terminated) the hypnotic state; namely: [218]\n\n\nThe psychoanalytic couch of Sigmund Freud\nThe noted neurologist and psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud not only studied and wrote about \"hypnosis\" (e.g., Freud, 1891, and 1966), but he also actively used \"hypnosis\" in his clinical practice for some time.\n\n\nMistaken identification of Esdaile's Jhar-Phoonk with d’Eslon's magnetization-by-contact\nDue, to a large extent, to the (mistaken) enthusiastic promotion of Esdaile's (otherwise) valuable work in India as \"mesmerism\" by John Elliotson (1791-1868), and William Collins Engledue (1813-1858) – especially by Elliotson [228] – in their influential journal, The Zoist, over its fifteen years of existence (i.e., March 1843 to January 1856), [229] the entirely mistaken, generally held, and (at the time) widely published view that (the otherwise highly significant) James Esdaile used \"mesmerism\" to produce the condition under which he conducted completely pain-free surgery is still being repeated in many of the modern accounts of the history of mesmerism, anaesthesia, and hypnotism.\n\n\nSee also\nNote that \"many pamphlets on magnetism bear false imprints; they purport to have been

France. It was a comprehensive investigation into the claims of animal magnetism, a concept developed by Franz Anton Mesmer, and its therapeutic applications. The commission was formed in response to the growing popularity of Mesmer's ideas, which had gained widespread attention in the medical and scientific communities.\n\n## Reasons for the Investigation\n\nThe investigation was sparked by concerns about the potential dangers of animal magnetism and its therapeutic applications. Mesmer's ideas, which involved the use of magnets to manipulate the body's magnetic fluid, had gained popularity among the public, but many in the medical and scientific communities were skeptical about their validity.\n\n## Tensions within the Royal Family\n\nFranz Mesmer had connections within the Royal family, having met Marie Antoinette in 1777. He had also received a letter of recommendation from Chancellor von Kaunitz, which helped him gain access to influential circles in Paris.\n\n## Social Impact\n\nMesmer's ideas had a significant social impact, as they challenged the conventional understanding of health and disease. His emphasis on the importance of harmony and balance in the body resonated with the growing movement towards democracy and greater equality in French society.\n\n## Festering Political Issues\n\nThe Royal Commission on Animal Magnetism took place at a time of great social and political upheaval in France. The Ancien Régime was under pressure, and the French Revolution was just around the corner. The commission's investigations would ultimately contribute to the growing tensions that would lead to the Revolution.\n\n## Professional Tensions\n\nThe commission's investigations also highlighted professional tensions within the medical community. Mesmer's ideas challenged the conventional understanding of medical practice, and many physicians were skeptical about his methods.\n\n## Scientific Issues\n\nThe commission's primary concern was to determine whether animal magnetism existed in a substantial physical way. They investigated the claims of Mesmer and his followers, but ultimately found no evidence to support their claims.\n\n## Medical Issues\n\nThe commission's investigations also highlighted the lack of understanding about the nature of health and disease. Mesmer's ideas about the importance of balance and harmony in the body were seen as radical and unorthodox by many in the medical community.\n\n## Religious Issues\n\nThe commission's investigations also touched on religious issues, as some saw Mesmer's ideas as a form of occultism. The Commission was forced to examine the affections of the spirit and the ideas of those who had been exposed to the action of 'Magnetism'.\n\n## The Two Commissions\n\nThe Royal Commission on Animal Magnetism consisted of two separate commissions: the \"Franklin Commission\" and the \"Society Commission\". The Franklin Commission was established to investigate the claims of Mesmer and his followers, while the Society Commission was established to investigate the therapeutic applications of animal magnetism.\n\n## The Report of the Franklin Commission\n\nThe Franklin Commission's report was presented to the King on August 11, 1784. They found no evidence to support the claims of Mesmer and his followers, and concluded that animal magnetism was not a real phenomenon.\n\n## The Report of the Society Commission\n\nThe Society Commission's report was presented to the King on August 16, 1784. They found that the therapeutic applications of animal magnetism were not supported by evidence, and concluded that it was not a viable treatment for disease.\n\n## Responses to the Commissions' Conclusions\n\nThe release of the commissions' reports generated a proliferation of publications, many of which were critical of the commissions' conclusions. However, many in the medical and scientific communities saw the commissions' reports as a vindication of their skepticism about animal magnetism.\n\n## Legacy of the Commission\n\nThe Royal Commission on Animal Magnetism had a significant impact on the development of modern medicine and science. It highlighted the importance of rigorous testing and experimentation in the evaluation of new ideas and treatments.\n\n## Vestiges of the Magnetization-by-Contact Practice\n\nDespite the commissions' conclusions, there were vestiges of the magnetization-by-contact practice that continued to be practiced by some in the medical community. These vestiges were eventually abandoned by their advocates.\n\n## Phreno-magnetism\n\nIn 1843, Robert Hanham Collyer announced that he had discovered the existence of phreno-magnetism, which was a form of magnetization-by-contact. However, this discovery was later retracted by Collyer.\n\n## The Psychoanalytic Couch of Sigmund Freud\n\nSigmund Freud used hypnosis in his clinical practice for some time, and his work on hypnosis laid the groundwork for the development of psychoanalysis.\n\n## Mistaken Identification of Esdaile's Jhar-Phoonk\n\nThe mistaken identification of Esdaile's Jhar-Phoonk as a form of mesmerism has led to a misunderstanding of the history of mesmerism and hypnosis.\n\nThe Royal Commission on Animal Magnetism was a significant event in the history of science, taking place in 1784 in France.

investigation\nAccording to Armando & Belhoste (2018, pp. 6–8), the true history of Mesmer, of Mesmer's version of 'animal magnetism', and of the rationale, conduct, investigations, experimentation, and findings of the 1784 Royal Commissions has been seriously distorted by the modern (\"cherry picking\") concentration upon \"the transformations of animal magnetism after 1820  [in relation to] hypnotism\", [14] and, especially, upon \"the elements of continuity and analogy between mesmerism  [sic] the various versions of psychoanalysis\" [15]\n\n\nTensions within the Royal family\nPrior to his arrival in Paris in 1777 – with a letter of recommendation from Chancellor von Kaunitz of the Habsburg monarchy to the Austrian Ambassador to France, the Comte de Mercy-Argenteau (who, in turn, introduced Mesmer to Jean-Baptiste Le Roy (1720–1800), the Director of the Academy of Sciences) – Mesmer was already known to Marie Antoinette [16]\n\n\nSocial impact\nMesmer's overall stress on the quest for \"harmony\" as a therapeutic outcome and, especially, given the demonstrated fact that the effects of his 'animal magnetism' – predicated upon the presence of a force analogous to gravity – were equally demonstrated by all, regardless of age, gender, class, race, intellect, etc., [20] was an important influence on many of the moves (and 'movers') within French society towards democracy and greater equality [21] [22]\n\n\nFestering political issues\nThe increasingly unpopular \"Ancien Régime\" was under considerable pressure from many quarters; and, within five years of the Commissions' Reports, the French Revolution had broken out The storming of the Bastille took place on 14 July 1789; and four years later, King Louis XVI was executed on 21 January 1793, and his Queen, Marie Antoinette, the  daughter of Empress Maria Theresa, and the sister  of Emperor Joseph II, was executed on 16 October 1793.\n\n\nProfessional tensions\nApart from the wider issue of having to evaluate and decide how to deal with those within the medical profession \"who saw animal magnetism as an interesting therapeutic resource\" (Armando & Belmonte, 2018, p. 13) – namely, the boundary disputes between the conventional therapeutic practices of the sorts that Brockliss and Jones (1997) usefully identify as lying within the established \"medical penumbra\" (pp. 230–283) and the novel and innovative practices at the \"frontier\" that were (potentially) responsible for the \"expansion of the medicable\" (pp. 441–459) – there were also significant tensions, differences, and boundary disputes between the more theory- and principle-centred Paris Faculty of Medicine (formed some five centuries earlier), and the more practitioner-centred Royal Society of Medicine (formed just 5 years earlier), the \"primary function\" of which was \"to evaluate patent medicines and, by extension, new forms of therapy\" (Forrest, 1999, pp. 18–19).\n\n\nScientific issues\nIn a prevailing atmosphere of \" [an overall] redefinition of frontiers in the legitimacy of knowledge\" – and, in relation to Mesmer's claims, a redefinition \"which did not necessarily match the public popularity that they attracted\" (Zanetti, 2018), p. 59) – the issue of the existence (or not) of a substantial \"magnetic fluid\" and/or \"animal magnetism\" required resolution.\n\n\nMedical issues\nAt a time when, in relation to \"healers and healing\", the conglomerate of \"physicians, empirics, surgeons, apothecaries, folk healers, and religious personalities all vied with each other (as well as worked together) for medical legitimacy and patients\" (Broomhall, 2004, p. 5), Mesmer was not only a \"foreign national\", [23] [24] but also one that had no affiliation of any kind with any known professional medical association within France (or elsewhere in Europe); and, as a consequence, his professional conduct, his medical practice, his medico-commercial enterprises, and his therapeutic endeavours were not regulated in any way.\n\n\nReligious issues\nAs discussed at considerable length by Spanos and Gottlieb (1979) there were not only a wide range of controversial secular and religious issues relating to the similarities and differences between the induction, manifestations, and immediate and long-term consequences of the \"crises\" that were (sporadically) produced by the 'magnetic' interventions, and the exorcisms of the Roman Catholic Church, but, also, of greater significance, to the occasional (apparently veridical) reports of post-magnetic \"clairvoyance\" [25] – a condition that was one of the classic indications for an exorcism whenever it was considered to be \"demonically inspired\" (as distinct from those cases in which it was considered to be \"divinely inspired\" (Spanos and Gottlieb, 1979, p. 538)) [26] [27] [28]\n\n\nThe two Commissions\nThe Commissions were appointed in early 1784 by the Baron de Breteuil, Secretary of State for the King's Household and Minister of the Department of Paris at the command of King Louis XVI [29]\n\n\n\"Franklin Commission\"\nThe first of the two Royal Commissions, usually referred to as the \"Franklin Commission\", was appointed on 12 March 1784.\n\n\n\"Society Commission\"\nThe second of the two Royal Commissions, usually referred to as the \"Society Commission\", was appointed on 5 April 1784.\n\n\nFranz Mesmer\nFranz Anton Mesmer (1734–1815), born in Swabia, having first studied law at Dillingen and Ingolstadt universities, transferred to the University of Vienna and began a study of medicine, graduating Medicinae Doctor (M.D.) at the age of 32, in 1766: his doctoral dissertation (Mesmer, 1766) had the official title A Physico-Medical Dissertation on the Influence of the Planets [46] [47] [48]\n\n\nPositioner of a concept\nRather than being the \"inventor\" of \"a technique\", as some (mis)represent the circumstances, it is clear that Mesmer's significance was in his \"positioning\" of an overarching \"concept\" (or \"construct\") through his creation and development – using analogies with gravity, terrestrial magnetism, and hydraulics (as they were understood at the time) – of \"an explanatory model to represent the way that healers had been healing people for thousands of years\" (Yeates, 2018, p. 48) [51] [52]\n\n\nMesmer's \"protoscience\", rather than \"pseudoscience\"\nAccording to Tatar (1990, p. 49), rather than Mesmer's proposal being some sort of \"occult theory\", \" [Mesmer] actually remained well within the bounds of eighteenth-century thought when he formulated his theories\" and \"the theories  [that Mesmer] invoked to explain  [the agency of \"animal magnetism\"] fit squarely into the frame of eighteenth-century cosmology\": and, moreover, \"to consider animal magnetism independently of the tradition out of which it emerged is to magnify its distinctively occult characteristics and to diminish in importance those features that mirror the scientific and philosophical temper of the age in which it flourished.\"\n\n\nA concept that must not be reified\nIt is clear from his Mémoire (1799) that Mesmer was very aware of the human propensity – in the normal, conventional use of language (la langue de convention) – to speak of \"properties\" or \"qualities\" (i.e., these \"metaphysical abstractions\",  illusions de la méthaphysique), as if they were \"substances\": in Mesmer's words, \"substantivise the properties\", substantisia les propriétés (Mesmer 1799, pp. 15–17) [59] — in other words, \"reification\", in the manner of Whitehead's \"fallacy of misplaced concreteness\" [60]\n\n\nBased on natural principles\nMesmer held the materialist position – that his therapies, which involved easily understood, systematic natural principles, were \"physiological\", rather than \"psychological\" interventions [62] – in contrast to the supernatural positions of, say, the exorcist Johann Joseph Gassner (1727–1779), [63]\n\n\nCharles d'Eslon\nCharles-Nicolas d’Eslon (1750–1786)  [fr], \"a disciple of the  [eminent French] surgeon J.L Petit\", [68] was a docteur-régent of the Paris Faculty of Medicine, and the one-time personal physician to the King's brother, Charles Philippe, Comte d’Artois – who, later (following the Bourbon Restoration in France) became King Charles X.\n\n\nAssociation with Mesmer\nd’Eslon, a one-time patient, pupil, and associate of Mesmer, [69] published a work on Mesmer's version of animal magnetism (while still associated with Mesmer), Observations sur le Magnétisme Animal (1780), [70] which presented details of 18 cases (10 male, 8 female) treated by Mesmer [71]\n\n\nOstracism\nOn 7 October 1780 – still associated with Mesmer and still a member of the Paris Faculty of Medicine – d'Eslon made an official request \"that an investigation of the authenticity and efficacy of Mesmer's claims and cures be made The Faculté rejected his plea, and in refusing accused  [d'Eslon] personally of misdemeanour\" [74]\n\n\nPost-Mesmer\nIn late 1782, and eighteen months before the Royal Commission, d'Eslon had (acrimoniously) parted ways with Mesmer; and, despite a brief reconciliation, the relationship was terminated in late 1783 On 28 December 1783, d'Eslon wrote a letter to the Journal de Paris, which not only described the difficulties he had experienced with Mesmer, but also announced that he was opening his own (entirely independent) clinic [77]\n\n\nLast days\nOnce d'Eslon had been expelled from the rank of docteur-régent, his membership of the Faculty of Medicine was never reinstated; and unlike Mesmer, he remained in Paris following the publication of the reports of the two Commissions Although apparently in good health in the preceding months, he died somewhat suddenly in Paris, on 21 August 1786, at the age of 47, [82] from a complex of disorders including pneumonia, a malignant fever (une fièvre maligne), and renal colic [83]\n\n\nAspects of Mesmer's evolving practices\nIt is significant that Mesmer, initially impressed by the therapeutic enterprises of the Jesuit astronomer, explorer, and healer Maximilian Hell (1720–1792) – which involved the application of steel magnets that had been specifically shaped either to fit particular body contours, or to match the actual dimensions of a specific organ (e.g., the liver) [84] – and, immediately recognizing the \"prima facie plausibility\" [85] of Hell's approach, purchased a number of steel magnets from Hell in 1774 and began applying them to his patients; however, as Pattie reports (1994, p. 2), Mesmer \"had  [entirely] abandoned the use of magnets\" by 1776, [86] because his own clinical experimentation had proved them to be utterly useless.\n\n\nMesmer's early experiments with magnets\nIt is significant that Mesmer, initially impressed by the therapeutic enterprises of the Jesuit astronomer, explorer, and healer Maximilian Hell (1720–1792) – which involved the application of steel magnets that had been specifically shaped either to fit particular body contours, or to match the actual dimensions of a specific organ (e.g., the liver) [84] – and, immediately recognizing the \"prima facie plausibility\" [85] of Hell's approach, purchased a number of steel magnets from Hell in 1774 and began applying them to his patients; however, as Pattie reports (1994, p. 2), Mesmer \"had  [entirely] abandoned the use of magnets\" by 1776, [86] because his own clinical experimentation had proved them to be utterly useless.\n\n\nThe glass armonica\nMesmer developed particular theatrical therapeutic rituals, often accompanied by the sounds of the Glass Armonica [88] [89] – an instrument invented by Benjamin Franklin himself [90] [91]  – that were associated with a wide range of (figurative) magnetic connotations, such as the use of \"magnetic wands\", and the treatment tub known as \"the baquet\", which, in the view of Yeates (2018, p. 48), were \"obviously, designed to amplify each subject's \"response expectancy\" (Kirsch, 1997, etc.) via impressive \"metonymical acts\" (Topley, 1976, p. 254)\".\n\n\nThe \"baquet\"\nThe \"baquet\" (lit 'a tub') was a device of Mesmer's design, that he had constructed by analogy with the newly invented \"Leyden Bottle\" – i.e., \"the first electric condenser  [viz., capacitor] in history\" (Morabito, 2019, p. 90) – which was \"supposed by analogy to 'store' animal magnetism\" (Forrest, 1999, p. 20) [93]\n\n\nThe \"magnetic crisis\"\nGiven Mesmer's regular (analogical) references throughout his works to the efficient grinding activities of smoothly functioning mills – speaking of how the windmills are driven by the wind, and watermills by the flow of water [98] – he usefully extended those analogies to explain the circumstances in which \"crises\" occur, especially in relation to the magnitude of the \"crises\": i.e., the dramatic circumstances of the sudden restoration of the lost function of a watermill installation – a direct consequence of the magnitude of the force of the flow of water that has been applied (through the currently stationary waterwheel) to the milling mechanism, which is, in and of itself, directly related to the extent to which the (now-operative) milling mechanism was formerly stationary, out of order, or, even, jammed:\n\n\nThe Commissions' observations and description of d'Eslon's \"magnetic crises\"\nNoting that some of those who were \"magnetized\" by d'Eslon over an extended time \"fell into the convulsive movements that have been called Crises\" – and noting that these \"convulsive movements\" (mouvemens convulsifs) were \"viewed  [by d'Eslon] as evidence of the particular agent to whom they are attributed\" – the \"Society\" Commissioners' Report, in its discussion of the \"Crises\", [102] identified a number of common characteristics among the majority of those who displayed these \"convulsive movements\": [103]\n\n\nThe Commissions' remarks on d'Eslon's \"magnetic crises\"\nNoting that some of those who were \"magnetized\" by d'Eslon over an extended time \"fell into the convulsive movements that have been called Crises\" – and noting that these \"convulsive movements\" (mouvemens convulsifs) were \"viewed  [by d'Eslon] as evidence of the particular agent to whom they are attributed\" – the \"Society\" Commissioners' Report, in its discussion of the \"Crises\", [102] identified a number of common characteristics among the majority of those who displayed these \"convulsive movements\": [103]\n\n\nThe Commissions' remarks on the perceived dangers of the \"magnetic crises\"\nIn the last section of its Report, the \"Franklin\" Commission, in addition to its remarks on the impact of the phenomena associated with a \"crisis\", made a number of significant observations on the perceived dangers of experiencing, or simply observing, a \"crisis\" in a number of domains, including:\n\n\nObservations of the frequency of \"crises\"\nOne interesting aspect of a number of the pro-d'Eslon and pro-Mesmer responses to the Commissions' Reports, collectively, was that they provided figures on the level to which the author in question had observed individual patients manifest full-blown \"magnetic crises\" as a consequence of their exposure to an extended sequence of standard \"magnetic\" treatments.\n\n\n\"Mesmerism\" vs. \"Animal Magnetism\"\nIn order to understand the significance of the two Commissions' concentration on their examination of d'Eslons' claims for the existence of \"animal magnetism\" (rather than, that is, conducting an examination of the clinical efficacy of Mesmer's actual therapeutic practices) – and, in order to clarify certain ambiguities, and correct particular errors that persist in the literature – a number of basic facts need to be addressed (see, for example, Yeates, 2018, pp. 48–52), it is useful to isolate what later, subsequent to the publication of Wolfart's Mesmerismus (1814), became known as \"Mesmerism\" from other \"animal magnetism\" practices in general.\n\n\nSimilarities and differences\nThe materialist \"mesmerists\" and the metaphysical \"animal magnetists\" each held that all animate beings (i.e., \"living\" beings: humans, animals, plants, etc.), in virtue of being alive, possessed an invisible, natural \"magnetic\" or \"gravitational force\" – thus magnetismus animalis, \"animal magnetism\", or gravitas animalis, \"animal gravity\" [112] – and the therapeutic interventions of each were directed at manipulating the ebb and flow of their subject's \"energy field\".\n\n\nThe \"mesmerists\"\nIn order to foster and promote orthopraxia, [114] the materialist \"mesmerists\" used qualitative (rather than quantitative) constructs – centred on Mesmer's abstract and metaphorical overarching analogies with gravity, terrestrial magnetism, and hydraulics – to explain the application of their techniques and to describe their therapeutic rationale.\n\n\nThe \"animal magnetists\"\nIn contrast to the mesmerists, the metaphysical \"magnetists\" – who (mistakenly) reified (i.e., \"substantivised\") the magnetic/fluidic metaphors of Mesmer – firmly believed that they were channeling a substantial \"fluidium\" and were manipulating a particular, substantial \"force\" [115]\n\n\nThe \"higher\" and \"lower\" phenomena of the magnetists\nBy the time of James Braid's (1841) Manchester encounter with the \"magnetic demonstrator\" Charles Lafontaine, [118] those who were still committed to the existence of a substantial 'magnetic fluid\", etc., maintained that the phenomena produced by their acts of \"magnetization\" were of two general classes – lower phenomena, [119] and higher phenomena [120] – the distinction being \"that, while there might be natural explanations for 'lower' phenomena, 'higher' phenomena could only be explained in terms of a paranormal or metaphysical agency\" (Yeates, 2018, p. 52).\n\n\nThe investigations\nRather than being concerned with the applications, utility, and clinical efficacy of d'Eslon's \"animal magnetism\", the primary concern of each Commission was the significant, crucial, and exclusive question of whether or not d'Eslon's (supposed) \"animal magnetic fluid\" actually existed in some substantial physical way – for the simple reason that, as the two sets of Commissioners each noted in their independent reports, \"Animal magnetism may well exist without being useful but it cannot be useful if it does not exist.\" [121]\n\n\nThe substantial existence of \"animal magnetism\" and \"magnetic fluid\" were investigated\nRather than being concerned with the applications, utility, and clinical efficacy of d'Eslon's \"animal magnetism\", the primary concern of each Commission was the significant, crucial, and exclusive question of whether or not d'Eslon's (supposed) \"animal magnetic fluid\" actually existed in some substantial physical way – for the simple reason that, as the two sets of Commissioners each noted in their independent reports, \"Animal magnetism may well exist without being useful but it cannot be useful if it does not exist.\" [121]\n\n\nMesmer's earlier refusal to have his \"magnetic\" interventions scrutinized\nAlready, in his earlier (18 September 1780) interaction with the Paris Faculty of Medicine, Mesmer had refused to have his therapeutic interventions on a set of entirely \"new\" patients directly scrutinized, claiming that his already-achieved \"cures\" were an objective matter of record [122] Mesmer justified his refusal as follows:\n\n\nMesmer's \"cures\" were never investigated\nIn relation to the question of the agency/cause of Mesmer's supposed \"cures\" – and in the process of constructing the protocols for their investigations into d'Eslon's \"animal magnetism\" – both Commissions were well aware that \"an effect's objective reality does not substantiate  [any of the] proffered explanations  [for its existence]\" (Yeates, 2018, p. 61) [125]\n\n\nThe efficacy of \"magnetic\" treatments and the agency of (supposed) \"magnetic\" cures were not investigated\nThe two Reports also (separately, and in some detail) explained why the nature of the \"effects\" of (supposedly efficacious) treatments were not being examined, and why the agency of the (supposed verified) \"cures\" were not being investigated.\n\n\nProblems with objectively determining the precise agency of any supposed \"cure\"\nThe Commissioners (Bailly, 1784, p. 15) stressed that, because they had been specifically charged with determining whether (or not) d'Eslon's \"magnetic fluid\" actually existed in some substantial form, and because it was obvious that, in order to unequivocally settle the \"uncertain\" and \"misleading\" issue of whether there were real \"cures\" of \"real\" diseases from d'Eslon's therapeutic interventions, and whether any such \"cures\" were entirely the \"effects\" of d'Eslon's treatment, and nothing else  – and even if the Commissioners were able \"to strip from these therapeutic effects all of the illusions which might be involved with them\" [131] – any such determination would require an \"infinity of cures\", supported by the \"experience of several centuries\" And, further, given the specified goal of the commission, the significance of whatever its findings might be, and the obligation to produce its Report \"promptly\", the Commissioners considered that,\n\n\nProblems with objectively determining the precise therapeutic action of any supposed \"efficacious remedy\"\nIn support of its decision, the \"Franklin Commission\" produced a cogent, extended argument, consistent with the medical knowledge of the day, that is equally relevant to similar investigations in the present day:\n\n\nOther highly significant, but unassociated \"causative\" factors\nIn addition to reflecting the position of the \"Franklin Commission\" in these matters, the \"Society Commission\" also noted that there were other equally significant causative factors, concomitant with, but unassociated with, the treatment delivered, in relation to the circumstances of the patients themselves; namely,\n\n\nCommon misrepresentation of fact\nThe preceding facts expose the error – a classic example of equivocation due to lexical ambiguity – in the commonly expressed (in modern literature) and extremely misleading misrepresentation of affairs; namely, the (historically incorrect, and mistaken) implication that, rather than simply having, for convenience, accepted Mesmer's assertions at face value (and left it at that), both Commissions had objectively verified that:\n\n\nProcedures\nThe \"Franklin\" Commission's investigations were conducted at a number of different locations, including d’Eslon's clinic (which they visited once a week [136]), Lavoisier's home, and the gardens of Franklin's Passy residence The intricate structure and detailed procedures of the investigations were designed by Lavoisier; [137] [138] and great care was taken to eliminate what James Braid would later identify as \"sources of fallacy\" [139]\n\n\nThe Report(s) of the \"Franklin Commission\"\nThe \"Franklin Commission's\" investigations produced three separate reports.\n\n\nThe issue of d'Eslon vs. Mesmer\nAt the head of their principal report, the Commissioners directly summarize Mesmer's 27 Propositions, [149] as expounded in Mesmer's 1779 Memoire (1779, pp. 74–83) They also quote Mesmer's own \"characterization\" of his principle [150] – namely, that \"In the influence of the magnetism, Nature holds out to us a sovereign instrument for securing the health and lengthening the existence of mankind\" [151]\n\n\nThe Commission's report\nThe first (66 page) report was presented to the King on 11 August 1784 [156]\n\n\nImmediate publication and dissemination\nThe report was immediately published by the government printer; and at least 20,000 copies were rapidly and very widely circulated throughout France and neighbouring countries [158] Within four months (16 December 1784), the London publishing house of Joseph Johnson was announcing the publication of a complete English version, translated by William Godwin (i.e., Godwin, 1785), [159] [160] and, in between February and July 1785, four different \"periodical abridgements of the Franklin report, each printed multiple times in the Atlantic coast publications\" were published in the United States (Ogden, 2012, p. 167); and, in 1837, Godwin's complete translation was published, in Philadelphia, as part of a collected work [161]\n\n\nTouch, imagination, and imitation\nClearly \"recogniz [ing] that publicly endorsing the curative effects of a technique that had no demonstrable basis in the science of the late 18th century could lead to a proliferation of medical quackery\" (McConkey & Perry, 2002, p. 328) and, based on their own \"experiments\" and \"observations\", the Commissioners concluded that \"the true causes of the effects attributed to this new agent known by the name of animal magnetism,  [and] to this fluid which is said to circulate in the body and to communicate itself from one individual to another\" were \"touch, imagination,  [and] imitation\": [162] [163]\n\n\nNo evidence to support d'Eslon's claims\nThe Commission found no evidence of any kind to support d'Eslon's claim for the existence of a \"magnetic fluid\":\n\n\nThe Commission's secret report (\"for the King's eyes only\")\nA second (brief) report – which had been presented privately to the King on 11 August 1784, [166] but not made public until 1800 (i.e., in the time of The Consulate period of French First Republic) – specifically addressed the perceived moral dangers occasioned by the physical practices of the animal magnetists:\n\n\nThe Commission's brief \"courtesy report\" to the Royal Academy of Sciences\nOn 4 September 1784, Bailly presented a third, brief (15 page) courtesy report to the Royal Academy of Sciences (Bailly, 1784b) [167] on behalf of himself, Franklin, Le Roy, de Bory, and Lavoisier (i.e., those Commissioners who were also Academy members), which provided their Academy colleagues with a brief account of the commission's proceedings, the rationale behind its investigations, and the results Noting that all of their investigations were jointly conducted with the four members of the Paris Faculty, and that all nine shared the same \"interest in  [discovering] the truth\", they stressed that all the findings of their combined efforts were \"unanimous\" (p. 2).\n\n\nThe importance of \"the Sciences\"\nFurther (p. 4), given that the understanding of the Sciences – \"which  [collectively] are increased by  [establishing] the truth\" (qui s’accroissent par les vérités) – is increased by \"the suppression of error\": i.e., given that \"error\" is always \"a bad leaven that ferments and, in the long run, corrupts the mass into which it has been introduced\" By contrast, however, in those cases wherein the \"error\" has been generated by \"The Empire of Science\", and has spread to \"the multitude\" – not only to divide and agitate minds, but also, in deceptively presenting a means of curing the sick, prevent them from seeking their cures elsewhere – \"good Government has an interest in destroying it\".\n\n\nPhysics\nNoting that the \"greater\" and \"more extraordinary\" a discovery, the more difficult it was to settle on suitable proof, they reported that, as physicists, they were unable to detect the presence of d'Eslon's supposed (substantial) \"fluid\" (p. 6) From this absence of \"physical evidence\", they were forced, instead, to \"examine the affections of the spirit and the ideas of those who had been exposed to the action of 'Magnetism'\"; and, from this, ceased to be \"physicists\", and became nothing more than \"philosophers\" (p. 8).\n\n\nChemistry\nHowever, having been unable to operate as physicists, they had decided to follow the standard procedures of \"chemists\" – who, having \"decomposed substances\" and thereby discovered their \"principles\", assured themselves of the \"exactness\" of their findings by \"recomposing\" the same substances from their \"reunited\" constituents (p. 9).\n\n\nImagination\nGiven their inability to detect any (substantial) 'magnetism' – and, from their observations that the \"effects\" (that were attributed by d'Eslon to the supposed 'magnetism' and the supposed 'fluid') were only manifested when the subjects believed they were 'magnetised' (and were not manifested when they were unaware that they had been 'magnetised') – the Commissioners concluded that the \"principle\" involved was the subject's \"imagination\"; and, therefore, as a consequence of their investigations, they were well satisfied that they had been \"fully successful\" in experimentally proving that the observed \"effects\" had been produced \"by the power of the imagination alone\" (p. 9).\n\n\nThe Report(s) of the \"Society Commission\"\nThe \"Society Commission's\" investigations produced two separate reports.\n\n\nThe report of four of the five Commissioners\nThe first of the two reports, made by four of the five Commissioners (of 39 pages) – namely, Charles-Louis-François Andry, Claude-Antoine Caille, Pierre Jean Claude Mauduyt de La Varenne, and Pierre-Isaac Poissonnier – was presented to the King on 16 August 1784 [169]\n\n\nThe (later) representations of Burdin and Dubois\nAlthough the \"Society\" Commission did not directly investigate the clinical efficacy of d'Eslon's therapeutic interventions, and did not examine the circumstances of any earlier (i.e., pre-Commission) \"cures\" claimed by d\"Eslon, two members of the Royal Academy of Medicine, Charles Burdin (1778-1856) and Frédéric Dubois (1797-1873)  [fr], writing in 1841, [173] drew attention to the fact that, in the process of their (1784) investigations, the \"Society\" Commissioners identified three categories of patient treated by d'Eslon [174] – (a) those with an \"obvious ailment\" with \"a known cause\", (b) those with \"mild\" and \"vague\" ailments with no known cause, and, finally, (c) the melancholics (\"Les mélancoliques\") – and, significantly, having followed the collective progress of d'Eslon's patients over a period of four months, the Commissioners found no evidence of any kind that any members of the '(a) group' (many of whom had been receiving d'Eslon's treatment \"for more than a year\") had been \"cured\" (guéris), or, even, \"noticeably relieved\" (notablement soulagés) of their ailment [175]\n\n\nde Jussieu's \"dissenting\" report\nThe second of the two reports, made by de Jussieu alone (of 51 pages) was independently published on 17 September 1784 [176]\n\n\nResponses to the Commissions' conclusions\nThe release of the reports generated a proliferation of publications, many of which were simply addressing issues relating to either \"mesmerism\" or \"animal magnetism\" in general – such as, for instance, those of Jean-Jacques Paulet (1784), and Michel-Augustin Thouret  [fr] (1784) – while others, such as those of Charles Joseph Devillers, himself a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences – who (at Devillers, 1784, pp. 165–166) compared the \"cures\" of Mesmer, with those supposed to have been effected at the tomb of François de Pâris in Saint-Médard, some forty years earlier – and Jacques Cambry (1784) – who provided details of beliefs similar to those of Mesmer previously held by the ancient Greeks, Persians, and Romans – strongly supported the findings of the Commissions.\n\n\nResponse of the Paris Faculty of Medicine\nImmediately following the release of the reports of the two Commissions, the Paris Faculty of Medicine \"pressure [d] its own members to renounce animal magnetism\" (Crabtree, 1993, p. 32).\n\n\nd'Eslon's response\nd'Eslon immediately published an attack on the commission's reports, [184] in which he criticized their failure to investigate the longer-term effects of his treatments, and their refusal to accept his (alleged) \"cures\" as proof of the existence of \"animal magnetism\", as well as noting that, \"the commissioners' recommendation that the practice of magnetism should be prohibited    would hardly be possible  [to implement]\", because, apart from those within the medical profession who had been trained by himself and by Mesmer, \"a large number of other people had, as a result of their own study, begun to practice it\" (Pattie, 1994, p. 171) [185]\n\n\nMesmer's response\nIn his own responses to the Commissions' Reports, [197] Mesmer stressed that – simply because he had not been involved in any of their investigations – the Commissioners' conclusions had nothing whatsoever to do with his (metaphorical) \"animal magnetism\"; and, because their conclusions only applied to d'Eslon's theories and practices, any responses to those conclusions were entirely the concern of d'Eslon alone.\n\n\nThe \"Franklin\" Commissions' investigations considered to be a \"classic\" example of a controlled trial\nThe detailed studies of Stephen Jay Gould (1989) and John Kihlstrom (2002), drew disciplinary attention to nature and the form of the commission's extended examination as a watershed moment in the history of science – subsequent to which things were never the same.\n\n\nThe \"Franklin\" Commissions' legacy\nThe \"classic\" structure of the investigations undertaken by the \"Franklin\" Commission [201] inspired – among many others over the ensuing years – the (1799) investigations of Chester physician John Haygarth (1740-1827) into the efficacy of Perkins' \"tractors\" [202] [203] [204]\n\n\nFour vestiges of the magnetization-by-contact practice\nIn relation to the findings of both Commissions – viz., that there was no evidence for d'Eslon's claims, and that d'Eslon's magnetization-by-contact practices had no place within the \"medical penumbra\" – and despite the consequent, and widespread demedicalization of both d'Eslon's magnetization-by-contact and of animal magnetism in general, there remained a small number of historically significant vestigial remnants of d'Eslon's magnetization-by-contact, the boundary-work of which, for a short while, operated at the frontier of the \"medical penumbra\" (Brockliss and Jones, 1997) in the (vain) hope of producing an \"expansion of the medicable\" (such that they would be admitted to conventional medical practice), which were (later) abandoned by their original advocates.\n\n\nPhreno-magnetism\nIn 1843, Robert Hanham Collyer (1814-1891), an American physician and former pupil of John Elliotson, announced that he had discovered the existence of phreno-magnetism in November 1839; [206] and, prior to Collyer's later retraction, two others claimed to have independently confirmed the veracity of Collyer's \"discovery\": the architect, Henry George Atkinson (1812-1890), at London, in November 1841, and the chemist, Charles Blandford Mansfield (1819-1849), at Cambridge, in December 1841 [207] [208]\n\n\nThe \"zones\" of Albert Pitres\nAround 1885, the neurologist Albert Pitres – the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Bordeaux, and an associate of  Charcot at the Salpêtrière hospital – claimed that he had discovered a system of \"zones\" on the surface of the body, the stimulation of which induced (or terminated) the hypnotic state; namely: [218]\n\n\nThe psychoanalytic couch of Sigmund Freud\nThe noted neurologist and psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud not only studied and wrote about \"hypnosis\" (e.g., Freud, 1891, and 1966), but he also actively used \"hypnosis\" in his clinical practice for some time.\n\n\nMistaken identification of Esdaile's Jhar-Phoonk with d’Eslon's magnetization-by-contact\nDue, to a large extent, to the (mistaken) enthusiastic promotion of Esdaile's (otherwise) valuable work in India as \"mesmerism\" by John Elliotson (1791-1868), and William Collins Engledue (1813-1858) – especially by Elliotson [228] – in their influential journal, The Zoist, over its fifteen years of existence (i.e., March 1843 to January 1856), [229] the entirely mistaken, generally held, and (at the time) widely published view that (the otherwise highly significant) James Esdaile used \"mesmerism\" to produce the condition under which he conducted completely pain-free surgery is still being repeated in many of the modern accounts of the history of mesmerism, anaesthesia, and hypnotism.\n\n\nSee also\nNote that \"many pamphlets on magnetism bear false imprints; they purport to have been printed in London, The Hague, Philadelphia, Peking, etc In this way they evaded French censorship\" (Pattie, 1994, p. 179).\n\n\nFootnotes\nNote that \"many pamphlets on magnetism bear false imprints; they purport to have been printed in London, The Hague, Philadelphia, Peking, etc In

{"title": "Day_of_the_Dead", "content": "\nOrigins, history, and similarities to other festivities\nMexican academics are divided on whether the festivity has genuine indigenous pre-Hispanic roots or whether it is a 20th-century rebranded version of a Spanish tradition developed during the presidency of Lázaro Cárdenas to encourage Mexican nationalism through an \"Aztec\" identity [12] [13] [14] The festivity has become a national symbol in recent decades and it is taught in the nation's school system asserting a native origin [15] In 2008, the tradition was inscribed in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO [11]\n\n\nObservance in Mexico\nA number of Mexico City's museums and public spaces have played an important part in developing and promoting urban Day of the Dead traditions through altars and installations These notable organizations include: Anahuacalli, The Frida Kahlo Museum, The Museum of Popular Cultures, The Dolores Olmedo Museum, The Museum of the First Printing Press, and The Cloister of Sor Juana From turn of the millennium until the imposition of the James Bond-inspired parade, remarkable large-scale installations were created on the Zocalo, Mexico City's central square [22]\n\n\nAltars and installations in Mexico City museums and public spaces\nA number of Mexico City's museums and public spaces have played an important part in developing and promoting urban Day of the Dead traditions through altars and installations These notable organizations include: Anahuacalli, The Frida Kahlo Museum, The Museum of Popular Cultures, The Dolores Olmedo Museum, The Museum of the First Printing Press, and The Cloister of Sor Juana From turn of the millennium until the imposition of the James Bond-inspired parade, remarkable large-scale installations were created on the Zocalo, Mexico City's central square [22]\n\n\nAltars (ofrendas)\nDuring Día de Muertos, the tradition is to build private altars (\"ofrendas\") containing the favorite foods and beverages, as well as photos and memorabilia, of the departed The intent is to encourage visits by the souls, so the souls will hear the prayers and the words of the living directed to them These altars are often placed at home or in public spaces such as schools and libraries, but it is also common for people to go to cemeteries to place these altars next to the tombs of the departed [7]\n\n\nFood\nDuring Day of the Dead festivities, food is both eaten by living people and given to the spirits of their departed ancestors as ofrendas ('offerings') [29] Tamales are one of the most common dishes prepared for this day for both purposes [30]\n\n\nCalaveras\nA common symbol of the holiday is the skull (in Spanish calavera), which celebrants represent in masks, called calacas (colloquial term for skeleton), and foods such as chocolate or sugar skulls, which are inscribed with the name of the recipient on the forehead Sugar skulls can be given as gifts to both the living and the dead [35] Other holiday foods include pan de muerto, a sweet egg bread made in various shapes from plain rounds to skulls, often decorated with white frosting to look like twisted bones [25]\n\n\nCalaverita\nIn some parts of the country, especially the larger cities, children in costumes roam the streets, knocking on people's doors for a calaverita, a small gift of candies or money; they also ask passersby for it This custom is similar to that of Halloween's trick-or-treating in the United States, but without the component of mischief to homeowners if no treat is given [36]\n\n\nCalaveras literarias\nA distinctive literary form exists within this holiday where people write short poems in traditional rhyming verse, called calaveras literarias (lit \"literary skulls\"), which are mocking, light-hearted epitaphs mostly dedicated to friends, classmates, co-workers, or family members (living or dead) but also to public or historical figures, describing interesting habits and attitudes, as well as comedic or absurd anecdotes that use death-related imagery which includes but is not limited to cemeteries, skulls, or the grim reaper, all of this in situations where the dedicatee has an encounter with death itself [37] [38] This custom originated in the 18th or 19th century after a newspaper published a poem narrating a dream of a cemetery in the future which included the words \"and all of us were dead\", and then proceeding to read the tombstones Current newspapers dedicate calaveras literarias to public figures, with cartoons of skeletons in the style of the famous calaveras of José Guadalupe Posada, a Mexican illustrator [35] In modern Mexico, calaveras literarias are a staple of the holiday in many institutions and organizations, for example, in public schools, students are encouraged or required to write them as part of the language class [10]\n\n\nLocal traditions\nThe traditions and activities that take place in celebration of the Day of the Dead are not universal, often varying from town to town For example, in the town of Pátzcuaro on the Lago de Pátzcuaro in Michoacán, the tradition is very different if the deceased is a child rather than an adult On November 1 of the year after a child's death, the godparents set a table in the parents' home with sweets, fruits, pan de muerto, a cross, a rosary (used to ask the Virgin Mary to pray for them), and candles This is meant to celebrate the child's life, in respect and appreciation for the parents There is also dancing with colorful costumes, often with skull-shaped masks and devil masks in the plaza or garden of the town At midnight on November 2, the people light candles and ride winged boats called mariposas (butterflies) to Janitzio, an island in the middle of the lake where there is a cemetery, to honor and celebrate the lives of the dead there.\n\n\nObservances outside of Mexico\nIn many communities in the United States with Mexican residents, Day of the Dead celebrations are very similar to those held in Mexico In some of these communities, in states such as Texas, [47] New Mexico, [48] and Arizona, [49] the celebrations tend to be mostly traditional The All Souls Procession has been an annual event since 1990 in Tucson, Arizona The event combines elements of traditional Day of the Dead celebrations with those of pagan harvest festivals People wearing masks carry signs honoring the dead and an urn in which people can place slips of paper with prayers on them to be burned [50] Likewise, Old Town San Diego, California, annually hosts a traditional two-day celebration culminating in a candlelight procession to the historic El Campo Santo Cemetery [51]\n\n\nNorth America\nIn many communities in the

[51]\n\n\nCalifornia\nSanta Ana, California, is said to hold the \"largest event in Southern California\" honoring Día de Muertos, called the annual Noche de Altares, which began in 2002 [58] The celebration of the Day of the Dead in Santa Ana has grown to two large events with the creation of an event held at the Santa Ana Regional Transportation Center for the first time on November 1, 2015 [59]\n\n\nItaly\nIn Italy, November 2 is All Souls' Day and is colloquially known as Day of the Dead or \"Giorno dei Morti\" While many regional nuances exist, celebrations generally consist of placing flowers at cemeteries and family burial sites and speaking to deceased relatives [64] Some traditions also include lighting a red candle or \"lumino\" on the window sills at sunset and laying out a table of food for deceased relatives who will come to visit Like other Day of the Dead traditions around the world, Giorno dei Morti is a day dedicated to honoring the lives of those who have died Additionally, it is a tradition that teaches children not to be afraid of death.\n\n\nAsia and Oceania\nMexican-style Day of the Dead celebrations occur in major cities in Australia, Fiji, and Indonesia, most organized by Mexican communities Additionally, an independent annual celebration is held in Wellington, New Zealand, complete with altars celebrating the deceased with flowers and gifts [68]\n\n\nPhilippines\nIn the Philippines \"Undás\" and \"Araw ng mga Yumao\", All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day, are celebrated following with the Roman Catholic tradition Filipinos traditionally observe these days by visiting the family dead to clean and repair their tombs, just as is done in Mexico Offerings of prayers, flowers, candles, and even food, while Chinese Filipinos additionally burn joss sticks and joss paper (kim) Many also spend the day and ensuing night holding reunions at the cemetery, having feasts and merriment [69] Due the cultural connections of the Philippines and Mexico with links going back to the Spanish Empire, they share some of the aspects of the practices done in the celebration [70]\n\n\nCzech Republic\nAs part of a promotion by the Mexican embassy in Prague, Czech Republic, since the late 20th century, some local citizens join in a Mexican-style Day of the Dead A theater group conducts events involving candles, masks, and make-up using luminous paint in the form of sugar skulls [71] [72]\n\n\nSimilar or related festivities\nIn Belize, Day of the Dead is practiced by people of the Yucatec Maya ethnicity The celebration is known as Hanal Pixan which means 'food for the souls' in their language Altars are constructed and decorated with food, drinks, candies, and candles put on them.\n\n\nAmericas\nIn Belize, Day of

La Paz, Bolivia, at the beginning of November after the celebrations of All Saints In pre-Columbian times indigenous Andeans had a tradition of sharing a day with the bones of their ancestors on the third year after burial Today families keep only the skulls for such rituals Traditionally, the skulls of family members are kept at home to watch over the family and protect them during the year On November 9, the family crowns the skulls with fresh flowers, sometimes also dressing them in various garments, and making offerings of cigarettes, coca leaves, alcohol, and various other items in thanks for the year's protection The skulls are also sometimes taken to the central cemetery in La Paz for a special Mass and blessing [73] [74] [75]\n\n\nBrazil\nThe Brazilian public holiday of Dia de Finados, Dia dos Mortos or Dia dos Fiéis Defuntos (Portuguese: \"Day of the Dead\" or \"Day of the Faithful Deceased\") is celebrated on November 2 Similar to other Day of the Dead celebrations, people go to cemeteries and churches with flowers and candles and offer prayers The celebration is intended as a positive honoring of the dead Memorializing the dead draws from indigenous and European Catholic origins.\n\n\nCosta Rica\nCosta Rica celebrates Día De Los Muertos on November 2 The day is also called Día de Todos Santos (All Saints Day) and Día de Todos Almas (All Souls' Day) Catholic masses are celebrated and people visit their loved ones' graves to decorate them with flowers and candles [76]\n\n\nEcuador\nIn Ecuador the Day of the Dead is observed to some extent by all parts of society, though it is especially important to the indigenous Kichwa peoples, who make up an estimated quarter of the population Indigena families gather together in the community cemetery with offerings of food for a day-long remembrance of their ancestors and lost loved ones Ceremonial foods include colada morada, a spiced fruit porridge that derives its deep purple color from the Andean blackberry and purple maize This is typically consumed with guaguas de pan, bread shaped like infants (or, more generally, people), though variations include many pigs—the latter being traditional to the city of Loja The bread, which is wheat flour-based today, but was made with masa in the Pre-Columbian era, can be made savory with cheese inside or sweet with a filling of guava paste These traditions have permeated mainstream society, as well, where food establishments add both colada morada and guaguas de pan to their menus for the season Many non-indigenous Ecuadorians visit the graves of the deceased, cleaning and bringing flowers, or preparing the traditional foods, too [77]\n\n\nGuatemala\nGuatemalan celebrations of the Day of the Dead, on November 1, are highlighted by the construction and flying of giant kites [78] It is customary to fly kites to help the spirits find their way back to Earth A few kites have notes for the dead attached to the strings of the kites The kites are used as a kind of telecommunication to heaven [35] A big event also is the consumption of fiambre, which is made only for this day during the year [35]  In addition to the traditional

(Day of the Dead)**\n\nDía de Muertos, or Day of the Dead, is a traditional Mexican holiday honoring and remembering loved ones who have passed away. The celebration is observed on November 1 and 2, coinciding with the Catholic holidays of All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day. This festive occasion has a rich history and unique customs that vary from town to town, but its core purpose remains the same – to pay tribute to the lives of those who have come before us.\n\n**Origins, history, and similarities to other festivities**\n\nThe origins of Día de Muertos are shrouded in mystery, with some academics arguing that it has genuine indigenous pre-Hispanic roots, while others propose that it is a 20th-century rebranded version of a Spanish tradition developed during the presidency of Lázaro Cárdenas to encourage Mexican nationalism through an \"Aztec\" identity. Regardless of its true origins, the festival has become a national symbol in recent decades and is taught in the nation's school system, asserting a native origin. In 2008, the tradition was inscribed in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.\n\n**Observance in Mexico**\n\nA number of Mexico City's museums and public spaces have played an important part in developing and promoting urban Day of the Dead traditions through altars and installations. These notable organizations include: Anahuacalli, The Frida Kahlo Museum, The Museum of Popular Cultures, The Dolores Olmedo Museum, The Museum of the First Printing Press, and The Cloister of Sor Juana. From the turn of the millennium until the imposition of the James Bond-inspired parade, remarkable large-scale installations were created on the Zocalo, Mexico City's central square.\n\n**Altars and installations in Mexico City museums and public spaces**\n\nThese notable organizations have contributed significantly to the development of urban Day of the Dead traditions. The altars and installations created by these institutions showcase the rich cultural heritage of Mexico and provide a unique perspective on the holiday.\n\n**Altars (ofrendas)**\n\nDuring Día de Muertos, the tradition is to build private altars (\"ofrendas\") containing the favorite foods and beverages, as well as photos and memorabilia, of the departed. The intent is to encourage visits by the souls, so the souls will hear the prayers and the words of the living directed to them. These altars are often placed at home or in public spaces such as schools and libraries, but it is also common for people to go to cemeteries to place these altars next to the tombs of the departed.\n\n**Food**\n\nDuring Day of the Dead festivities, food is both eaten by living people and given to the spirits of their departed ancestors as ofrendas ('offerings'). Tamales are one of the most common dishes prepared for this day for both purposes. Other holiday foods include pan de muerto, a sweet egg bread made in various shapes from plain rounds to skulls, often decorated with white frosting to look like twisted bones.\n\n**Calaveras**\n\nA common symbol of the holiday is the skull (in Spanish calavera), which celebrants represent in masks, called calacas (colloquial term for skeleton), and foods such as chocolate or sugar skulls, which are inscribed with the name of the recipient on the forehead. Sugar skulls can be given as gifts to both the living and the dead.\n\n**Calaveritas**\n\nIn some parts of the country, especially the larger cities, children in costumes roam the streets, knocking on people's doors for a calaverita, a small gift of candies or money; they also ask passersby for it. This custom is similar to that of Halloween's trick-or-treating in the United States, but without the component of mischief to homeowners if no treat is given.\n\n**Calaveras literarias**\n\nA distinctive literary form exists within this holiday where people write short poems in traditional rhyming verse, called calaveras literarias (lit \"literary skulls\"), which are mocking, light-hearted epitaphs mostly dedicated to friends, classmates, co-workers, or family members (living or dead) but also to public or historical figures, describing interesting habits and attitudes, as well as comedic or absurd anecdotes that use death-related imagery which includes but is not limited to cemeteries, skulls, or the grim reaper, all of this in situations where the dedicatee has an encounter with death itself.\n\n**Local traditions**\n\nThe traditions and activities that take place in celebration of the Day of the Dead are not universal, often varying from town to town. For example, in the town of Pátzcuaro on the Lago de Pátzcuaro in Michoacán, the tradition is very different if the deceased is a child rather than an adult.\n\n**Observances outside of Mexico**\n\nIn many communities in the United States with Mexican residents, Day of the Dead celebrations are very similar to those held in Mexico. In some of these communities, in states such as Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, the celebrations tend to be mostly traditional. The All Souls Procession has been an annual event since 1990 in Tucson, Arizona. The event combines elements of traditional Day of the Dead celebrations with those of pagan harvest festivals.\n\n**Italy**\n\nIn Italy, November 2 is All Souls' Day and is colloquially known as Day of the Dead or \"Giorno dei Morti.\" While many regional nuances exist, celebrations generally consist of placing flowers at cemeteries and family burial sites and speaking to deceased relatives. Some traditions also include lighting a red candle or \"lumino\" on the window sills at sunset and laying out a table of food for deceased relatives who will come to visit.\n\n**Asia and Oceania**\n\nMexican-style Day of the Dead celebrations occur in major cities in Australia, Fiji, and Indonesia, most organized by Mexican communities. Additionally, an independent annual celebration is held in Wellington, New Zealand, complete with altars celebrating the deceased with flowers and gifts.\n\n**Philippines**\n\nIn the Philippines, \"Undás\" and \"Araw ng mga Yumao,\" All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day, are celebrated following with the Roman Catholic tradition. Filipinos traditionally observe these days by visiting the family dead to clean and repair their tombs, just as is done in Mexico. Offerings of prayers, flowers, candles, and even food, while Chinese Filipinos additionally burn joss sticks and joss paper (kim).\n\n**Czech Republic**\n\nAs part of a promotion by the Mexican embassy in Prague, Czech Republic, since the late 20th century, some local citizens join in a Mexican-style Day of the Dead. A theater group conducts events involving candles, masks, and make-up using luminous paint in the form of sugar skulls.\n\n**Similar or related festivities**\n\nIn Belize, Day of the Dead is practiced by people of the Yucatec Maya ethnicity.

Indigena families gather together in the community cemetery with offerings of food for a day-long remembrance of their ancestors and lost loved ones.\n\n**Guatemala**\n\nGuatemalan celebrations of the Day of the Dead, on November 1, are highlighted by the construction and flying of giant kites. It is customary to fly kites to help the spirits find their way back to Earth. A big event also is the consumption of fiambre, which is made only for this day during the year.\n\n**Peru**\n\nIt is common for Peruvians to visit the cemetery, play music and bring flowers to

poem narrating a dream of a cemetery in the future which included the words \"and all of us were dead\", and then proceeding to read the tombstones Current newspapers dedicate calaveras literarias to public figures, with cartoons of skeletons in the style of the famous calaveras of José Guadalupe Posada, a Mexican illustrator [35] In modern Mexico, calaveras literarias are a staple of the holiday

All four are outspoken critics of Trump; Schmidt left the Republican Party in 2018. Jennifer Rubin, in a Washington Post op-ed, described the four founders as \"Some of the most prominent NeverTrump Republicans.\" Horn is a Republican operative and former chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party; Steslow is a marketing strategist and political consultant; Galen is an independent political consultant; and Madrid is a former political director for the California Republican Party. Galen serves as the Lincoln Project's treasurer. Sarah Lenti, a political consultant who had worked with Galen on the George W Bush presidential campaign, was recruited as executive director.\n\n**Before the 2020 Election**\n\nThe Lincoln Project produced a number of anti-Trump and pro-Biden television advertisements. The Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin called the project's ads \"devastating for several reasons: They are produced with lightning speed, and thereby catch the public debate at just the right moment; they hammer Trump where he is personally most vulnerable (e.g., concerns about his vigor, concerns about foreign corruption); and they rely to a large extent on Trump himself—his words and actions.\" The committee's ads were designed to target Trump's weaknesses and to exploit his narcissistic personality.\n\n**Post-Election**\n\nIn January 2021, responding to a magazine article accusing him of sexual misconduct spanning a period of years, co-founder John Weaver acknowledged having sent inappropriate sexual messages to multiple men, for which he apologized. According to The New York Times, Weaver offered young men professional support in exchange for sex; that report also accused him of cultivating a non-sexual online relationship with a fourteen-year-old boy and then engaging in \"sexual banter\" with him after his eighteenth birthday. Following the revelations, the Lincoln Project said \"John's statement speaks for itself.\" It later issued a follow-up statement describing him as \"a predator, a liar, and an abuser\" and denouncing his \"deplorable and predatory behavior.\" They denied having any knowledge of the allegations against Weaver until learning of it after it was revealed by The New York Times and other media, a claim vociferously denied by numerous members of the Project, who insisted that they had raised the issue with leadership many months earlier.\n\n**Fundraising and Expenditures**\n\nThe Lincoln Project raised $87,404,908 and spent $81,956,298 during the 2019-2020 election cycle. The committee's fundraising substantially increased in subsequent months; from July to September 2020, the Lincoln Project raised $39 million. The committee's spending was focused on producing television ads, which were designed to target Trump's weaknesses and to exploit his narcissistic personality.\n\n**Strategies**\n\nThe Lincoln Project achieved success in having its ads go viral and with its \"nontraditional strategy of playing mind games with the president.\" Politico said that the Lincoln Project \"successfully established itself as a squatter in Trump's mental space, thanks to several factors: members each boasting hundreds of thousands of social media followers, rapidly cut ads that respond to current events and a single-minded focus on buying airtime wherever Trump is most likely to be bingeing cable news that day, whether it's the D.C market or his golf courses across the country.\" The committee's strategy was designed to trigger Trump's narcissistic reactivity and to exploit his inability to take criticism.\n\n**Reception**\n\nDemocratic strategist James Carville praised the group for being more efficient and aggressive than Democratic PACs, saying: \"Let me tell you, the Lincoln group and The Bulwark, these Never Trumper Republicans, the Democrats could learn a lot from them They're mean They fight hard And we don't fight like that.\" The New Republic wrote that \"they make punches that Democratic officials and operatives often seem inclined to pull.\"\n\n**Influence**\n\nThe Lincoln Project's feud with Trump enhanced its national profile, including through earned media. The committee said it raised $1.4 million after Trump's tweets responding to the May 4, 2020, Mourning in America video.\n\n**Members**\n\nThe Lincoln Project has a number of notable members, including:\n\n* George Conway, attorney and husband of Kellyanne Conway\n* Steve Schmidt, former manager of John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign\n* John Weaver, former advisor to John McCain's presidential campaign\n* Rick Wilson, media consultant\n* Jennifer Horn, former chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party\n* Ron Steslow, marketing strategist and political consultant\n* Reed Galen, independent political consultant\n* Mike Madrid, former political director for the California Republican Party\n* Sarah Lenti, political consultant\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Donald Trump\n* Republican Party\n* 2020 Presidential Election\n* Political Action Committee\n\n**Explanatory Notes**\n\nThe Lincoln Project is a 501(c)(4) organization, which means that it is a tax-exempt organization that is allowed to engage in lobbying and advocacy activities. The committee's primary goal is to promote the election of Democratic candidates and to defeat Republican candidates, particularly those who support Trump.\n\nThe Lincoln Project has been criticized for its tactics, which some have described as \"vulgar\" and \"mean-spirited.\" However, the committee's supporters argue that its tactics are necessary to counter the \"vulgar\" and \"mean-spirited\" tactics of Trump and his allies.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Lincoln_Project\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThe committee was announced on December 17, 2019, in a New York Times op-ed by George Conway, Steve Schmidt, John Weaver, and Rick Wilson [4] Other co-founders include Jennifer Horn, Ron Steslow, Reed Galen, and Mike Madrid [5] Conway is an attorney and the husband of Kellyanne Conway, at the time an advisor to Trump; Schmidt managed John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign; Weaver oversaw McCain's presidential campaign in 2000; [6] and Wilson is a media consultant [7] All four are outspoken critics of Trump; Schmidt left the Republican Party in 2018 [8] Jennifer Rubin, in a Washington Post op-ed, described the four founders as \"Some of the most prominent NeverTrump Republicans\" [9] Horn is a Republican operative [10] and former chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party, [11] Steslow is a marketing strategist and political consultant, [12] Galen is an independent political consultant, [13] and Madrid is a former political director for the California Republican Party [14] Galen serves as the Lincoln Project's treasurer [15] Sarah Lenti, a political consultant who had worked with Galen on the George W Bush presidential campaign, was recruited as executive director [2]\n\n\nBefore the 2020 election\nThe committee was announced on December 17, 2019, in a New York Times op-ed by George Conway, Steve Schmidt, John Weaver, and Rick Wilson [4] Other co-founders include Jennifer Horn, Ron Steslow, Reed Galen, and Mike Madrid [5] Conway is an attorney and the husband of Kellyanne Conway, at the time an advisor to Trump; Schmidt managed John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign; Weaver oversaw McCain's presidential campaign in 2000; [6] and Wilson is a media consultant [7] All four are outspoken critics of Trump; Schmidt left the Republican Party in 2018 [8] Jennifer Rubin, in a Washington Post op-ed, described the four founders as \"Some of the most prominent NeverTrump Republicans\" [9] Horn is a Republican operative [10] and former chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party, [11] Steslow is a marketing strategist and political consultant, [12] Galen is an independent political consultant, [13] and Madrid is a former political director for the California Republican Party [14] Galen serves as the Lincoln Project's treasurer [15] Sarah Lenti, a political consultant who had worked with Galen on the George W Bush presidential campaign, was recruited as executive director [2]\n\n\nPost-election\nIn January 2021, responding to a magazine article accusing him of sexual misconduct spanning a period of years, co-founder John Weaver acknowledged having sent inappropriate sexual messages to multiple men, for which he apologized [33] According to The New York Times, Weaver offered young men professional support in exchange for sex; that report also accused him of cultivating a non-sexual online relationship with a fourteen-year-old boy and then engaging in \"sexual banter\" with him after his eighteenth birthday [34] Following the revelations, the Lincoln Project said \"John's statement speaks for itself\" [35] It later issued a follow-up statement describing him as \"a predator, a liar, and an abuser\" and denouncing his \"deplorable and predatory behavior\" [33] They denied having any knowledge of the allegations against Weaver until learning of it after it was revealed by The New York Times and other media, a claim vociferously denied by numerous members of the Project, who insisted that they had raised the issue with leadership many months earlier [36] [37] [38]\n\n\nTelevision ads\nThe Lincoln Project produced a number of anti-Trump and pro-Biden television advertisements [50] The Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin called the project's ads \"devastating for several reasons: They are produced with lightning speed, and thereby catch the public debate at just the right moment; they hammer Trump where he is personally most vulnerable (e.g., concerns about his vigor, concerns about foreign corruption); and they rely to a large extent on Trump himself—his words and actions.\" [51]\n\n\nFundraising and expenditures\nOpenSecrets, which tracks money spent on politics, reported that the Lincoln Project raised $87,404,908 and spent $81,956,298 during the 2019-2020 election cycle $51,406,346 came from individuals who had donated $200 or more [76] (An earlier estimate was $78 million (~$90.5 million in 2023) from its creation until the November 2020 election.)

{"title": "Inauguration_of_Joe_Biden", "content": "\nContext\nThe inauguration marked the formal culmination of the presidential transition of Joe Biden, who had become president-elect after defeating Donald Trump on November 3, 2020 [6] The victory of Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, was formalized by the Electoral College vote, which took place on December 14, 2020 [7] In accordance with Article I, Section 6 of the United States Constitution, Harris resigned her seat in the U.S Senate effective noon on January 18, 2021 [8] Trump repeatedly falsely disputed the legitimacy of the election, but committed to an orderly transition of power exactly two months after losing [9]\n\n\nOrganizers\nThe swearing-in ceremony for President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris was planned by the Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, a bipartisan committee composed of United States Senators Roy Blunt (chairman), Mitch McConnell, and Amy Klobuchar, and United States Representatives Nancy Pelosi, Steny Hoyer, and Kevin McCarthy [12] [5] The committee is overseen by the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration [5]\n\n\nJoint Congressional Committee\nThe swearing-in ceremony for President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris was planned by the Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, a bipartisan committee composed of United States Senators Roy Blunt (chairman), Mitch McConnell, and Amy Klobuchar, and United States Representatives Nancy Pelosi, Steny Hoyer, and Kevin McCarthy [12] [5] The committee is overseen by the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration [5]\n\n\nPresidential Inaugural Committee\nThe 2021 Presidential Inaugural Committee organized several other inauguration‑related events at the direction of the president‑elect and vice president‑elect of the United States The committee was led by Jim Clyburn, Eric Garcetti, Cedric Richmond, Lisa Blunt Rochester, and Gretchen Whitmer (co-chairs), Tony Allen (chief executive officer), Maju Varghese (executive director), Yvanna Cancela and Erin Wilson (deputy executive directors), David A Kessler (chief medical adviser), and Adrienne Elrod (director of talent and external affairs) [15] The committee hired Stephanie Cutter and Ricky Kirshner, who produced the largely virtual 2020 Democratic National Convention, along with Glenn Weiss to organize the inaugural programming [16]\n\n\nTheme and programming\nThe Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies chose the inaugural theme \"Our Determined Democracy: Forging a More Perfect Union\" to highlight the inaugural ceremony as a \"hallmark of American governance and democracy\" and stress the peaceful transition of power [5]\n\n\nPlanning\nOn September 3, 2020, the Capitol Police Board announced that public access to the West Front of the United States Capitol would be restricted from September 7, 2020, to February 28, 2021, to \"allow for the safe and secure construction of the Inaugural platform, stands, and other infrastructure necessary to support the event\" [19] Construction began on September 29, 2020 [20] The traditional \"first nail ceremony\" commemorating the start of construction of the inaugural platform was not held because it coincided with the death and state funeral of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court justice [21] The platform can support 1,600 spectators However, far fewer were permitted for this event, due to attendance restrictions designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 [4] Another 1,000 people, often choirs and musical guests, are traditionally situated on risers above the platform, but these were not used at full capacity for this event [5]\n\n\nCosts\nCompared to past inaugurations, the drastic reduction in crowd size at Biden's inauguration was expected to reduce costs [22] Typically, presidential inaugurations cost about US$100 million [22] In September 2020, prior to implementing attendance restrictions, costs were estimated to exceed US$44.9 million, with the District of Columbia's costs incurred in connection with the event being reimbursed by the federal government [23] However, the storming of the Capitol two weeks prior to the inauguration on January 6, along with threats of nationwide unrest, significantly increased the need for security [24] John Sandweg, a former Homeland Security Department official, remarked that the United States Secret Service likely has a surplus of funds because of lower-than-usual expenses during the 2020 campaign season, when presidential nominating conventions were mostly virtual and the travel of presidential candidates was curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic [22]\n\n\nSecurity and counter-terrorism efforts\nThe storming of the United States Capitol on January 6 raised concerns about the security of the inauguration [25] [26] However, Biden chose not to move the ceremony indoors, indicating that he believed a public, outdoor ceremony was necessary to demonstrate strength [27] In response, organizers and officials made an unprecedented effort to secure the Capitol during the ceremony and deter people from visiting Washington, D.C., during the week of the inauguration over concerns of political violence While several individuals were arrested near the Capitol in the days preceding the event for carrying illegal weapons, [28] disobeying police, [29] and trespassing, [30] and a fire near a homeless encampment prompted an evacuation of the grounds, [31] the ceremony proceeded without incident [32] A heightened security presence remained in the city through the end of the month [33]\n\n\nSecurity operations\nThe inauguration, like all ceremonies since the first inauguration of George W Bush in 2001, was designated a National Special Security Event (NSSE) [24] However, following the attack and reports of subsequent threats to disrupt Biden's inauguration and incite nationwide unrest, the Secret Service launched a security operation that surpassed any in modern U.S history [25] [34] The Secret Service established a Multi-Agency Command Center (MACC) to coordinate security—formed six days earlier than planned—composed of agents and representatives from many government agencies (such as the FBI, U.S Marshals Service, Defense Department, Park Police, and D.C Metro Police) and private companies (including a gas company, CSX railroad, and Amtrak) [25] Combined efforts included:\n\n\nTravel restrictions and site closures\nOn the Saturday before the inauguration, America United: An Inauguration Welcome Event Celebrating America's Changemakers, opened the inaugural program through a series of musical performances and political speeches [56] [17] The live-streamed event opened with an original performance of \"Everybody Deserves To Be Free\" by the Resistance Revival Choir, a group of female and non-binary protest singers, [57] featuring a lead vocal by soul artist Deva Mahal [56]\n\n\nPre-inaugural events\nOn the Saturday before the inauguration, America United: An Inauguration Welcome Event Celebrating America's Changemakers, opened the inaugural program through a series of musical performances and political speeches [56] [17] The live-streamed event opened with an original performance of \"Everybody Deserves To Be Free\" by the Resistance Revival Choir, a group of female and non-binary protest singers, [57] featuring a lead vocal by soul artist Deva Mahal [56]\n\n\nAmerica United inaugural welcome\nOn the Saturday before the inauguration, America United: An Inauguration Welcome Event Celebrating America's Changemakers, opened the inaugural program through a series of musical performances and political speeches [56] [17] The live-streamed event opened with an original performance of \"Everybody Deserves To Be Free\" by the Resistance Revival Choir, a group of female and non-binary protest singers, [57] featuring a lead vocal by soul artist Deva Mahal [56]\n\n\nOfficial musical playlist\nThe Biden Inaugural Committee released an official musical playlist of 46 songs (symbolizing Biden as the 46th president) that was curated by disc jockey D-Nice and music label Raedio, [60] created by actress Issa Rae [61] The playlist was part of the committee's efforts to have Americans participate from home for the inauguration [62] The playlist, released on all major streaming platforms, included Biden, Harris, and their spouses' \"walk-on songs\", which were played when they appeared on stage at campaign rallies [60] [62] According to Rolling Stone, Biden's \"walk-on song\" was \"We Take Care of Our Own\" by Bruce Springsteen; Jill Biden's was \"You Make My Dreams (Come True)\" by Hall & Oates; Harris's was \"Work That\" by Mary J Blige; and Emhoff's was \"You Get What You Give\" by New Radicals [60] Committee CEO Allen remarked that the musical selections \"reflect the relentless spirit and rich diversity of America\" and served as the \"score to a new chapter\" in American history as Biden and Harris begin their \"important work to unite  [the] country\" [60] [62]\n\n\n\"We the People\" virtual concert\nOn the Sunday before the inauguration, Biden's inaugural committee organized the virtual \"We the People\" concert fundraiser co-hosted by actor Keegan-Michael Key and actress Debra Messing [63] Attendees of the live-streamed event had to donate to the Biden Inaugural Committee to be allowed entry [64] The concert opened with Biden and his wife, Jill, thanking supporters of his campaign and acknowledging the lives lost in the COVID-19 pandemic; Biden remarked that it is the \"honor of  [his] lifetime\" to serve as president [64]\n\n\nNational Day of Service\nTwo days before Inauguration Day, January 18, 2021, was Martin Luther King Jr Day, the federal holiday that recognizes Dr King's birthday Biden and his inaugural committee encouraged Americans to engage in acts of community service and organized more than 2,500 virtual or socially distant volunteer events in 56 U.S states and territories in partnership with AmeriCorps [70] The committee recommended several volunteer activities aimed at improving people's economic, health, and social well-being, [71] including writing cards for those recovering from COVID-19, knitting sentimental items for the homeless, serving at \"contactless\" food and clothing donation drives, and participating in community cleanups [72] Biden and his wife volunteered at Philabundance, a non-profit food bank in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by helping box canned goods [73] Harris and her husband volunteered in Washington, D.C [74]\n\n\nUnited We Serve online event\n\nOn the evening of Martin Luther King Jr Day, the Biden inaugural committee celebrated Dr King's commitment to community service through virtual speeches and music in United We Serve: A Celebration of the National MLK Day of Service [75] [76] Co-hosts Sean Patrick Thomas and Lynn Whitfield introduced the event and commended the acts of volunteerism Americans participated in during the day of service; both Harris and her husband, Emhoff, appeared and discussed the importance of the inauguration and community service [76] Dr King's son, Martin Luther King III, daughter-in-law, Andrea, and granddaughter, Yolanda, discussed community service; his youngest daughter, Bernice King, then spoke at a pulpit and remarked on her late father's practice of nonviolence [75] Musician Aloe Blacc performed his song \"My Way\"; [77] cellist Yo-Yo Ma performed Air and Simple Gifts, a composition he also performed at the 2009 inauguration in the presence of then-Vice President-elect Biden; [78] Andra Day performed her song \"Rise Up\"; BeBe Winans sang Dr King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech; [79] Alejandro Fernández and band Maná performed \"Decepciones\"; [80] and Chesca and Diane Warren performed \"El Cambio\", which was frequently played during Biden's campaign Additional speakers included Al Sharpton, NAACP president Derrick Johnson, National Urban League president Marc Morial, Senators Cory Booker and Tammy Duckworth, Kansas Congresswoman Sharice Davids, actress Rosario Dawson, and several other academics and civil rights activists who spoke on the legacy of Dr King [77]\n\nField of Flags\nAcross the National Mall to 13th Street, a public art display composed of 191,500 U.S flags and 56 pillars of light (representing the 50 U.S states, D.C., and the five permanently inhabited U.S territories), were installed, representing those who could not attend the inauguration in person due to the attendance restrictions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 [81] [82] The field was lit the evening of January 18 [83]\n\n\nLincoln Memorial lighting\nOn Tuesday, January 19, Biden departed his home state of Delaware in a send-off ceremony at his late son Beau Biden's namesake Major Joseph R \"Beau\" Biden III National Guard/Reserve Center in New Castle; [84] the event included remarks from Delaware Governor John Carney, Biden, his wife Jill, and a benediction by Rabbi Michael S Beals of Congregation Beth Shalom in Wilmington [85] Later that day, Biden, Harris, and their spouses participated in a nationwide lighting ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool [86] Inaugural organizers invited communities around the United States to light buildings and ring church bells at 5:30 p.m ET on the eve of the inauguration in a moment of \"unity and remembrance\" for those lost to the pandemic [86] The Lincoln Memorial lighting was held simultaneously, providing a moment of national reflection to help Americans find the spirit to rebuild after the pandemic [87] Cardinal Wilton Daniel Gregory, the archbishop of Washington, delivered the ceremony's invocation; gospel singer Yolanda Adams sang \"Hallelujah\" and Michigan nurse Lori Marie Key performed \"Amazing Grace\" Both Biden and Harris, in their addresses, emphasized the importance of national grieving, with Biden saying it's \"how  [Americans] heal\" [84] Several national landmarks participated in the lighting ceremony, including the Empire State Building, Space Needle, and other buildings in major U.S cities, as well as on tribal lands [87] Washington National Cathedral tolled its bells four hundred times, each one in memory of a thousand Americans who had died, thus far, in the COVID-19 pandemic [88]\n\n\nOther virtual events\nAsian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) were celebrated in AAPI Inaugural Ball: Breaking Barriers, a partnership between

Day morning\nBiden and his wife spent the night of January 19 at Blair House, the President's Guest House—a custom for incoming presidents [96] Traditionally, the president-elect meets with the outgoing president at the White House on the morning of their inauguration after a church service Since Trump did not attend the inaugural ceremony—becoming the first outgoing president to not attend since Andrew Johnson in 1869 [97]—and did not communicate with Biden directly since the second presidential debate of the 2020 campaign, this tradition was not upheld [98] Before each of his inaugurations as vice president, Biden attended a Catholic Mass celebrated by Kevin O'Brien In 2013, this service was at the vice president's residence [99] Biden and his wife, along with the second family attended a Mass of Thanksgiving celebrated by O'Brien at the Cathedral of St Matthew in Washington [100] Biden extended invitations to the four congressional leaders from both parties—Senate

festivities were conducted virtually, primarily modeled after the 2020 Democratic National Convention [117] The ceremony took place outdoors on the West Front of the United States Capitol, the site of every inauguration since Ronald Reagan's in 1981 While members of Congress, in previous years, would receive 200,000 tickets to distribute among constituents, on this occasion, each member was allotted one guest ticket, [118] with many taking their spouses [119] Only about three thousand people were to be permitted into the secure perimeter areas, [120] and the total live attendance for the scaled-down event was to be just over a thousand, [121] with guests seated both on the inaugural platform and in front of the platform [119]\n\n\nCeremony\nThe U.S Army Herald Trumpets played ruffles and flourishes The U.S Marine Band (nicknamed \"The President's Own\") played a medley of patriotic music by Sousa, Bagley, and others; heralded the entry of dignitaries to the inaugural platform with works including a newly commissioned Fanfare for Tomorrow written by Peter Boyer, [135] \"Hail, America\" to introduce then-President-elect Biden; \"Hail, Columbia\" (the official anthem of the vice president) to introduce then-Vice President Pence and after Harris was sworn in, and \"Hail to the Chief\" (the official anthem of the president) after Biden was sworn in The band had appeared at every presidential inauguration since Thomas Jefferson's in 1801 [136] [137] Courtney Williams, Senior Chief Musician and concert moderator for the U.S Navy Concert Band, returned as the platform announcer for his fourth consecutive inauguration [138]\n\n\nOaths of office\nAssociate Justice Sonia Sotomayor administered the oath of office to Harris at 11:40 a.m., with 20 minutes remaining in Pence's term Sotomayor became the first woman to administer an inaugural oath twice after she administered Biden's at his 2013 swearing-in [154] Harris recited the following:\n\n\nInaugural address\nThe inaugural address was 2,514 words long and took 21 minutes to deliver, between 11:52 a.m and 12:13 p.m., with 7 minutes remaining in President Trump's term and in the first 13 minutes of President Biden's term Biden's inaugural speech was regarded as laying out his vision to unite the nation prefaced by the various impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic strife, climate change, political polarization, and racial injustice [159] Biden composed the speech with the assistance of speechwriter Vinay Reddy, senior advisor Mike Donilon, then-incoming Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and chief of staff Ron Klain [160] His speech was described by the New York Times as a \"direct rebuttal\" in tone to Trump's inaugural address (in which Trump spoke of \"American carnage\"), as Biden called for an end to the \"uncivil war\" of political, demographic, and ideological American cultures through a greater embrace of diversity [161]\nIn the speech, Biden repeated his campaign pledge to \"fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did\" [162] [163] Focusing on the struggles of American citizens, Biden expressed sympathy, but stressed that distrust and fighting amongst one another would not better their conditions [164] He cited the Civil War, Great Depression, world wars, and September 11 attacks as moments in American history where citizens' \"better angels\" prevailed, saying that the solution—unity—must again be invoked to rise from the \"cascading\" crises of the present; this unity, he proclaimed, exists in the \"common objects\" that define America: \"opportunity, liberty, dignity, respect, honor, and .. truth\" [164] [162]\n\n\nPost-inaugural events: \"America United\"\nAfter the swearing-in ceremony, Biden, Harris, and their spouses participated in a Pass in Review on the East Front of the United States Capitol featuring members of the United States Armed Forces Traditionally, before the Pass in Review, the new president would escort the outgoing president to a helicopter, Marine One, where they would officially depart Washington, D.C [169] However, Trump's decision to not attend Biden's inauguration and rather depart prior to the event's outset broke this custom The congressional luncheon, a tradition witnessed since the 1897 inauguration of William McKinley, was canceled due to public health concerns, the first time since the 1977 inauguration of Jimmy Carter [170] However, Biden and Harris were presented several gifts in the Capitol rotunda, including Landscape with Rainbow by Robert S Duncanson, two lead Lenox crystal vases cut by Peter O'Rourke, two flags that had been flown over the Capitol during the inaugural ceremony, and portraits of them taking their oaths of office [171]\n\n\nWreath laying ceremony\nFollowing the Pass in Review, Biden and Harris, along with former presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama, and all their spouses, participated in a wreath laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery [43] The television package included footage of former presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama at Arlington Memorial Amphitheater discussing the peaceful transition of power [174] \nPresidential historian Timothy Naftali noted that the ceremony was significant because Congress had decided on Inauguration Day in 1921, almost a hundred years prior to Biden's, to bury an unidentified soldier who died in World War I at the spot [175] Naftali additionally remarked that the gathering of Biden and former presidents to honor the unknown soldiers who died in war served as a \"visual message of unity, at a time of anxiety, pain and suffering in  [the] country\" [175]\n\n\nParade Across America\nFollowing the wreath laying ceremony, a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue, NW escorted Biden and Harris to the White House which included every branch of the U.S military, along with drumline bands from Biden and Harris's alma maters, the University of Delaware and Howard University, respectively [176] [177] The Virtual Parade Across America, organized by the Biden Inaugural Committee, was hosted by actor Tony Goldwyn, reflecting the \"diversity, heritage, and resilience of the country\" in the event's musical acts, poets, dance troupes, and more [178] [176] Viewing stands outside the White House that were originally constructed for members of the public were dismantled because they were ultimately deemed unnecessary for the revised plans [179] The live parade was announced by Charlie Brotman, who has served as the inaugural parade announcer during almost every ceremony since former President Dwight D Eisenhower's second inauguration [84] [180]\n\n\nCelebrating America\nCelebrating America was a television special hosted by Tom Hanks that aired the evening of the inauguration across most major television networks and other cable and streaming outlets The event featured many musical guests and celebrities, including Bruce Springsteen, Jon Bon Jovi, Justin Timberlake, Dave Grohl, Tim McGraw, Lin-Manuel Miranda, John Legend, Demi Lovato, and Katy Perry [183] The Biden Inaugural Committee raised over $61.8 million for the event from various companies, unions, and individuals [184]\n\n\nNational Prayer Service\nAt 10:00 a.m on the morning of January 21, the National Prayer Service took place at Washington National Cathedral A virtual service, Biden and his family participated from the White House More than thirty religious leaders of various faiths participated; William Barber II preached, calling for a \"third reconstruction\" of America in his homily [185]\n\n\nProtests and demonstrations\nA series of protests and counter-protests related to the results of the 2020 presidential election began in December 2020 [186] After the storming of the Capitol, D.C Mayor Muriel Bowser requested the Interior Department to cancel city demonstration permits and reject demonstration applications during the inauguration, [43] [187] but the agency declined to do so [187] The National Park Service designated two adjacent areas—portions of the John Marshall Park and Navy Memorial—exclusively for \"First Amendment activities\" (protests) [38] [188] The U.S Park Police limited demonstration attendance to a maximum of one hundred individuals in each location and required participants be screened via magnetometers [188] The left-wing groups ANSWER Coalition and D.C Action Lab were granted permits and staged demonstrations within attendance limits [187]\n\n\nViewership\nNearly forty million people watched Biden's address on the combined major cable news and broadcast network television stations [192] More than 21 million people watched the prime time Celebrating America special [192] In 2017, a combined 38.3 million viewers watched Trump's inaugural address across the same networks, [192] according to Nielsen data, representing a 4% increase in raw television viewership [193] CNN was the ratings leader throughout the day Compared to the previous inaugural ceremony in 2017, Fox News's viewership fell 77%, while CNN's tripled and MSNBC's quadrupled [193] The figures below, Nielsen data sourced from Adweek, [194] do not include streaming figures [193]\n\n\nInternational reactions\nBiden and Harris's assumption of their respective offices was met with congratulations from many world leaders, including prime ministers Muhyiddin Yassin, Scott Morrison, Alexander De Croo, Boris Johnson, Justin Trudeau, Mette Frederiksen, Sanna Marin, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Katrín Jakobsdóttir, Narendra Modi, Micheál Martin, Benjamin Netanyahu, Giuseppe Conte, Yoshihide Suga, Jacinda Ardern, Erna Solberg, Imran Khan, António Costa, Pedro Sánchez, and Stefan Löfven; presidents Xi Jinping,

Context\n\nThe inauguration of Joe Biden as the 46th President of the United States marked the culmination of the presidential transition of Joe Biden, who had become president-elect after defeating Donald Trump on November 3, 2020. The victory of Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, was formalized by the Electoral College vote, which took place on December 14, 2020. Trump repeatedly falsely disputed the legitimacy of the election, but committed to an orderly transition of power exactly two months after losing.\n\n## Organizers\n\nThe swearing-in ceremony for President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris was planned by the Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, a bipartisan committee composed of United States Senators Roy Blunt (chairman), Mitch McConnell, and Amy Klobuchar, and United States Representatives Nancy Pelosi, Steny Hoyer, and Kevin McCarthy. The committee is overseen by the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n## Joint Congressional Committee\n\nThe Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, a bipartisan committee composed of United States Senators Roy Blunt (chairman), Mitch McConnell, and Amy Klobuchar, and United States Representatives Nancy Pelosi, Steny Hoyer, and Kevin McCarthy. The committee is overseen by the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n## Presidential Inaugural Committee\n\nThe 2021 Presidential Inaugural Committee organized several other inauguration-related events at the direction of the president-elect and vice president-elect of the United States. The committee was led by Jim Clyburn, Eric Garcetti, Cedric Richmond, Lisa Blunt Rochester, and Gretchen Whitmer (co-chairs), Tony Allen (chief executive officer), Maju Varghese (executive director), Yvanna Cancela and Erin Wilson (deputy executive directors), David A Kessler (chief medical adviser), and Adrienne Elrod (director of talent and external affairs).\n\n## Theme and programming\n\nThe Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies chose the inaugural theme \"Our Determined Democracy: Forging a More Perfect Union\" to highlight the inaugural ceremony as a \"hallmark of American governance and democracy\" and stress the peaceful transition of power. The theme was reflected in the various events and programming organized by the inaugural committee.\n\n## Planning\n\nOn September 3, 2020, the Capitol Police Board announced that public access to the West Front of the United States Capitol would be restricted from September 7, 2020, to February 28, 2021, to \"allow for the safe and secure construction of the Inaugural platform, stands, and other infrastructure necessary to support the event\". Construction began on September 29, 2020. The traditional \"first nail ceremony\" commemorating the start of construction of the inaugural platform was not held because it coincided with the death and state funeral of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court justice.\n\n## Costs\n\nCompared to past inaugurations, the drastic reduction in crowd size at Biden's inauguration was expected to reduce costs. Typically, presidential inaugurations cost about US$100 million. In September 2020, prior to implementing attendance restrictions, costs were estimated to exceed US$44.9 million, with the District of Columbia's costs incurred in connection with the event being reimbursed by the federal government. However, the storming of the Capitol two weeks prior to the inauguration on January 6, along with threats of nationwide unrest, significantly increased the need for security.\n\n## Security and counter-terrorism efforts\n\nThe storming of the United States Capitol on January 6 raised concerns about the security of the inauguration. However, Biden chose not to move the ceremony indoors, indicating that he believed a public, outdoor ceremony was necessary to demonstrate strength. In response, organizers and officials made an unprecedented effort to secure the Capitol during the ceremony and deter people from visiting Washington, D.C., during the week of the inauguration over concerns of political violence.\n\n## Security operations\n\nThe inauguration, like all ceremonies since the first inauguration of George W Bush in 2001, was designated a National Special Security Event (NSSE). However, following the attack and reports of subsequent threats to disrupt Biden's inauguration and incite nationwide unrest, the Secret Service launched a security operation that surpassed any in modern U.S history.\n\n## Travel restrictions and site closures\n\nOn the Saturday before the inauguration, America United: An Inauguration Welcome Event Celebrating America's Changemakers, opened the inaugural program through a series of musical performances and political speeches. The live-streamed event opened with an original performance of \"Everybody Deserves To Be Free\" by the Resistance Revival Choir, a group of female and non-binary protest singers, featuring a lead vocal by soul artist Deva Mahal.\n\n## Pre-inaugural events\n\nTwo days before Inauguration Day, January 18, 2021, was Martin Luther King Jr Day, the federal holiday that recognizes Dr King's birthday. Biden and his inaugural committee encouraged Americans to engage in acts of community service and organized more than 2,500 virtual or socially distant volunteer events in 56 U.S states and territories in partnership with AmeriCorps.\n\n## COVID-19 public health measures and attendance\n\nMost traditional inaugural festivities were conducted virtually, primarily modeled after the 2020 Democratic National Convention. The ceremony took place outdoors on the West Front of the United States Capitol, the site of every inauguration since Ronald Reagan's in 1981. Members of Congress, in previous years, would receive 200,000 tickets to distribute among constituents, but on this occasion, each member was allotted one guest ticket, with many taking their spouses.\n\n## Ceremony\n\nThe U.S Army Herald Trumpets played ruffles and flourishes.

Sotomayor became the first woman to administer an inaugural oath twice after she administered Biden's at his 2013 swearing-in. Harris recited the following: \"I, Kamala Harris, do solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution of the United States.\"\n\n## Inaugural address\n\nThe inaugural address was 2,514 words long and took 21 minutes to deliver, between 11:52 a.m and 12:13 p.m., with 7 minutes remaining in President Trump's term and in the first 13 minutes of President Biden's term. Biden's inaugural speech was regarded as laying out his vision to unite the nation, prefaced by the various impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic strife, climate change, political polarization, and racial injustice.\n\n## Post-inaugural events: \"America United\"\n\nAfter the swearing-in ceremony, Biden, Harris, and their spouses participated in a Pass in Review on the East Front of the United States Capitol featuring members of the United States Armed Forces. The congressional luncheon, a tradition witnessed since the 1897 inauguration of William McKinley, was canceled due to public health concerns, the first time since the 1977 inauguration of Jimmy Carter.\n\n## Wreath laying ceremony\n\nFollowing the Pass in Review, Biden and Harris, along with former presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama, and all their spouses, participated in a wreath laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery.

[20] The traditional \"first nail ceremony\" commemorating the start of construction of the inaugural platform was not held because it coincided with the death and state funeral of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court justice [21] The platform can support 1,600 spectators However, far fewer were permitted for this event, due to attendance restrictions designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 [4] Another 1,000 people, often choirs and musical guests, are traditionally situated on risers above the platform, but these were not used at full capacity for this event [5]\n\n\nCosts\nCompared to past inaugurations, the drastic reduction in crowd size at Biden's inauguration was expected to reduce costs [22] Typically, presidential inaugurations cost about US$100

event being reimbursed by the federal government [23] However, the storming of the Capitol two weeks prior to the inauguration on January 6, along with threats of nationwide unrest, significantly increased the need for security [24] John Sandweg, a former Homeland Security Department official, remarked that the United States Secret Service likely has a surplus of funds because of lower-than-usual expenses during the 2020 campaign season, when presidential nominating conventions were mostly virtual and the travel of presidential candidates was curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic [22]\n\n\nSecurity and counter-terrorism efforts\nThe storming of the United States Capitol on January 6 raised concerns about the security of the inauguration [25] [26] However, Biden chose not to move the ceremony indoors, indicating that he believed a public, outdoor ceremony was necessary to demonstrate strength [27] In response, organizers and officials made an unprecedented effort to secure the Capitol during the ceremony and deter people from visiting Washington, D.C., during the week of the inauguration over concerns of political violence While several individuals were arrested near the Capitol in the days preceding the event for carrying illegal weapons, [28] disobeying police, [29] and trespassing, [30] and a fire near a homeless encampment prompted an evacuation

disrupt Biden's inauguration and incite nationwide unrest, the Secret Service launched a security operation that surpassed any in modern U.S history [25] [34] The Secret Service established a Multi-Agency Command Center (MACC) to coordinate security—formed six days earlier than planned—composed of agents and representatives from many government agencies (such as the FBI, U.S Marshals Service, Defense Department, Park Police, and D.C Metro Police) and private companies (including a gas company, CSX railroad, and Amtrak) [25] Combined efforts included:\n\n\nTravel restrictions and

(symbolizing Biden as the 46th president) that was curated by disc jockey D-Nice and music label Raedio, [60] created by actress Issa Rae [61] The playlist was part of the committee's efforts to have Americans participate from home for the inauguration [62] The playlist, released on all major streaming platforms, included Biden, Harris, and their spouses' \"walk-on songs\", which were played when they appeared on stage at campaign rallies [60] [62] According to Rolling Stone, Biden's \"walk-on song\" was \"We Take Care of Our Own\" by Bruce Springsteen; Jill Biden's was \"You Make My Dreams

committee encouraged Americans to engage in acts of community service and organized more than 2,500 virtual or socially distant volunteer events in 56 U.S states and territories in partnership with AmeriCorps [70] The committee recommended several volunteer activities aimed at improving people's economic, health, and social well-being, [71] including writing cards for those recovering from COVID-19, knitting sentimental items for the homeless, serving at \"contactless\" food and clothing donation drives, and participating in community cleanups [72] Biden and his wife volunteered at Philabundance, a non-profit food bank in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by helping box canned goods [73] Harris and her husband volunteered in Washington, D.C [74]\n\n\nUnited We Serve online event\n\nOn the evening of Martin Luther King Jr Day, the Biden inaugural committee celebrated Dr King's commitment to community service through virtual speeches and music in United We Serve: A Celebration of the National MLK Day of Service [75] [76] Co-hosts Sean Patrick Thomas and Lynn Whitfield introduced the event and commended the acts of volunteerism Americans participated in during the day of service; both Harris and her husband, Emhoff, appeared and discussed the importance of the inauguration and community service [76] Dr King's son, Martin Luther King III, daughter-in-law, Andrea, and granddaughter, Yolanda, discussed community service; his youngest daughter, Bernice King, then spoke at a pulpit and remarked on her late father's practice of nonviolence [75] Musician Aloe Blacc performed his song \"My Way\"; [77] cellist Yo-Yo Ma performed Air and Simple Gifts, a composition he also performed at the 2009 inauguration in the presence of then-Vice President-elect Biden; [78] Andra Day performed her song \"Rise Up\"; BeBe Winans sang Dr King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech; [79] Alejandro Fernández and band Maná performed \"Decepciones\"; [80] and Chesca and Diane Warren

[82] The field was lit the evening of January 18 [83]\n\n\nLincoln Memorial lighting\nOn Tuesday, January 19, Biden departed his home state of Delaware in a send-off ceremony at his late son Beau Biden's namesake Major Joseph R \"Beau\" Biden III National Guard/Reserve Center in New Castle; [84] the event included remarks from Delaware Governor John Carney, Biden, his wife Jill, and a benediction by Rabbi Michael S Beals of Congregation Beth Shalom in Wilmington [85] Later that day, Biden, Harris, and their spouses participated in a nationwide lighting ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool [86] Inaugural organizers invited communities around the United States to light buildings and ring church bells at 5:30 p.m ET on the eve of the inauguration in a moment of \"unity and remembrance\" for those lost to the pandemic [86] The Lincoln Memorial lighting was held simultaneously, providing a moment of national reflection to help Americans find the spirit to rebuild after the pandemic [87] Cardinal Wilton Daniel Gregory, the archbishop of Washington, delivered the ceremony's invocation; gospel singer Yolanda Adams sang \"Hallelujah\" and Michigan nurse Lori Marie Key performed \"Amazing Grace\" Both Biden and Harris, in their addresses, emphasized the importance of national grieving, with Biden saying it's \"how  [Americans] heal\" [84] Several national landmarks participated in the lighting ceremony, including the Empire State Building, Space Needle, and other buildings in major U.S cities, as well as on tribal lands [87] Washington National Cathedral tolled its bells four hundred times, each one in memory of a thousand Americans who had died, thus far, in the COVID-19 pandemic [88]\n\n\nOther virtual events\nAsian American and

which he routinely took during his time as a U.S Senator However, on January 14, this plan was canceled due to security concerns [94] On January 20, 2017, after completing his tenure as vice president, Biden departed the city on an Amtrak Acela train bound for his namesake station in Wilmington [95]\n\n\nInauguration Day morning\nBiden and his wife spent the night of January 19 at Blair House, the President's Guest House—a custom for incoming presidents [96] Traditionally, the president-elect meets with the outgoing president at the White House on the morning of their inauguration after a church service Since Trump did not attend the inaugural ceremony—becoming the first outgoing president to not attend since Andrew Johnson in 1869 [97]—and did not communicate with Biden directly since the second presidential debate of the 2020 campaign, this tradition was not upheld [98] Before each of his inaugurations as vice president, Biden attended a Catholic Mass celebrated by Kevin O'Brien In 2013, this service was at the vice president's residence [99] Biden and his wife, along with the second family attended a Mass of Thanksgiving celebrated by O'Brien at the Cathedral

Marine One [104] Cannons fired in salute, after a military band played \"Hail to the Chief\", in front of a modest crowd of a few hundred aides and other loyalists [105] Trump's White House had issued invitations for the event to many present and former administration officials Several invitees who have been critical of Trump, such as Don McGahn, John F Kelly, and Anthony Scaramucci, declined to attend [106] [84]\n\n\n\"Our White House\" online event\nBeginning two hours before the outset of the inaugural ceremony, actress Keke Palmer hosted Our White House: An Inaugural Celebration for Young Americans, a livestream aimed at engaging youth in the day's events [114] Jill Biden addressed viewers in a pre-recorded message, and historians Doris Kearns Goodwin and Erica Armstrong Dunbar discussed the ceremony's significance; a Nickelodeon special on White House pets and PBS NewsHour student interviews aired, along with other curated educational content [114]\n\n\nInaugural events\nThe transfer of power included the transition of official administration Twitter accounts, @POTUS and @VP Members of the Biden administration also assumed ownership of a number of institutional accounts, including @WhiteHouse, @FLOTUS for First Lady Jill Biden, @SecondGentleman for Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, and @PressSec for White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki [115] New executive branch websites were initialized; previous administrations' websites reside in the National Archives [116]\n\n\nPresidential communications\nThe transfer of power included the transition of official administration Twitter accounts, @POTUS and @VP Members of the Biden administration also assumed ownership of a number of institutional accounts, including @WhiteHouse, @FLOTUS for First Lady Jill Biden, @SecondGentleman for Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, and @PressSec for White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki [115] New executive branch websites were initialized; previous administrations' websites reside in the National Archives [116]\n\n\nCOVID-19 public health measures and attendance\nMost traditional inaugural festivities were conducted virtually, primarily modeled after the 2020 Democratic National Convention [117] The ceremony took place outdoors on the West Front of the United States Capitol, the site of every inauguration since Ronald Reagan's in 1981 While members of Congress, in previous years, would receive 200,000 tickets to distribute among constituents, on this occasion, each member was allotted one guest ticket, [118] with many taking their spouses [119] Only about three thousand people were to be permitted into the secure perimeter areas, [120] and the total live attendance for the scaled-down event was to be just over a thousand, [121] with guests seated both on the inaugural platform and in front of the platform [119]\n\n\nCeremony\nThe U.S Army Herald Trumpets played ruffles and flourishes The U.S Marine Band (nicknamed \"The President's Own\") played a medley of patriotic music by Sousa, Bagley, and others; heralded the entry of dignitaries to the inaugural platform with works including a newly commissioned Fanfare for Tomorrow written by Peter Boyer, [135] \"Hail, America\" to introduce then-President-elect Biden; \"Hail, Columbia\" (the official anthem of the vice president) to introduce then-Vice President Pence and after Harris was sworn in, and \"Hail to the Chief\" (the official anthem of the president) after Biden was sworn in The band had appeared at every presidential inauguration since Thomas Jefferson's in 1801 [136] [137] Courtney Williams, Senior Chief Musician and concert moderator for the U.S Navy Concert Band, returned as the platform announcer for his fourth consecutive inauguration [138]\n\n\nOaths of office\nAssociate Justice Sonia Sotomayor administered the oath of office to Harris at 11:40 a.m., with 20 minutes remaining in Pence's term Sotomayor became the first woman to administer an inaugural oath twice after she administered Biden's at his 2013 swearing-in [154] Harris recited the following:\n\n\nInaugural address\nThe inaugural address was 2,514 words long and took 21 minutes to deliver, between 11:52 a.m and 12:13 p.m., with 7 minutes remaining in President Trump's term and in the first 13 minutes of President Biden's term Biden's inaugural speech was regarded as laying out his vision to unite the nation prefaced by the various impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic strife, climate change, political polarization, and racial injustice [159] Biden composed the speech with the assistance of speechwriter Vinay Reddy, senior advisor Mike Donilon, then-incoming Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and chief of staff Ron Klain [160] His speech was described by the New York Times as a \"direct rebuttal\" in tone to Trump's inaugural address (in which Trump spoke of \"American carnage\"), as Biden called for an end to the \"uncivil war\" of political, demographic, and ideological American cultures through a greater embrace of diversity [161]\nIn the speech, Biden repeated his campaign pledge to \"fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did\" [162] [163] Focusing on the struggles of American citizens, Biden expressed sympathy, but stressed that distrust and fighting amongst one another would not better their conditions [164] He cited the Civil War, Great Depression, world wars, and September 11 attacks as moments in American history where citizens' \"better angels\" prevailed, saying that the solution—unity—must again be invoked to rise from the \"cascading\" crises of the present; this unity, he proclaimed, exists in the \"common objects\" that define America: \"opportunity, liberty, dignity, respect, honor, and .. truth\" [164] [162]\n\n\nPost-inaugural events: \"America United\"\nAfter the swearing-in ceremony, Biden, Harris, and their spouses participated in a Pass in Review on the East Front of the United States Capitol featuring members of the United States Armed Forces Traditionally, before the Pass in Review, the new president would escort the outgoing president to a helicopter, Marine One, where they would officially depart Washington, D.C [169] However, Trump's decision to not attend Biden's inauguration and rather depart prior to the event's outset broke this custom The congressional luncheon, a tradition witnessed since the 1897 inauguration of William McKinley, was canceled due to public health concerns, the first time since the 1977 inauguration of Jimmy Carter [170] However, Biden and Harris were presented several gifts in the Capitol rotunda, including Landscape with Rainbow by Robert S Duncanson, two lead Lenox crystal vases cut by Peter O'Rourke, two flags that had been flown over the Capitol during the inaugural ceremony, and portraits of them taking their oaths of office [171]\n\n\nWreath laying ceremony\nFollowing the Pass in Review, Biden and Harris, along with former presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama, and all their spouses, participated in a wreath laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery [43] The television package included footage of former presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama at Arlington Memorial Amphitheater discussing the peaceful transition of power [174] \nPresidential historian Timothy Naftali noted that the ceremony was significant because Congress had decided on Inauguration Day in 1921, almost a hundred years prior to Biden's, to bury an unidentified soldier who died in World War I at the spot [175] Naftali additionally remarked that the gathering of Biden and former presidents to honor the unknown soldiers who died in war served as a \"visual message of unity, at a time of anxiety, pain and suffering in  [the] country\" [175]\n\n\nParade Across America\nFollowing the wreath laying ceremony, a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue, NW escorted Biden and Harris to the White House which included every branch of the U.S military, along with drumline bands from Biden and Harris's alma maters, the University of Delaware and Howard University, respectively [176] [177] The Virtual Parade Across America, organized by the Biden Inaugural Committee, was hosted by actor Tony Goldwyn, reflecting the \"diversity, heritage, and resilience of the country\" in the event's musical acts, poets, dance troupes, and more [178] [176] Viewing stands outside the White House that were originally constructed for members of the public were dismantled because they were ultimately deemed unnecessary for the revised plans [179] The live parade was announced by Charlie Brotman, who has served as the inaugural parade announcer during almost every ceremony since former President Dwight D Eisenhower's second inauguration [84] [180]\n\n\nCelebrating America\nCelebrating America was a television special hosted by Tom Hanks that aired the evening of the inauguration across most major television networks and other cable and streaming outlets The event featured many musical guests and celebrities, including Bruce Springsteen, Jon Bon Jovi, Justin Timberlake, Dave Grohl, Tim McGraw, Lin-Manuel Miranda, John Legend, Demi Lovato, and Katy Perry [183] The Biden Inaugural Committee raised over $61.8 million for the event from various companies, unions, and individuals [184]\n\n\nNational Prayer Service\nAt 10:00 a.m on the morning of January 21, the National Prayer Service took place at Washington National Cathedral A virtual service, Biden and his family participated from the White House More than thirty religious leaders of various faiths participated; William Barber II preached, calling for a \"third reconstruction\" of America in his homily [185]\n\n\nProtests and demonstrations\nA series of protests and counter-protests related to the results of the 2020 presidential election began in December 2020 [186] After the storming of the Capitol, D.C Mayor Muriel Bowser requested the Interior Department to cancel city demonstration permits and reject demonstration applications during the inauguration, [43] [187] but the agency declined to do so [187] The National Park Service designated two adjacent areas—portions of the John Marshall Park and Navy Memorial—exclusively for \"First Amendment activities\" (protests) [38] [188] The U.S Park Police limited demonstration attendance to a maximum of one hundred individuals in each location and required participants be screened via magnetometers [188] The left-wing groups ANSWER Coalition and D.C Action Lab were granted permits and staged demonstrations within attendance limits [187]\n\n\nViewership\nNearly forty million people watched Biden's address on the combined major cable news and broadcast network television stations [192] More than 21 million people watched the prime time Celebrating America special [192] In 2017, a combined 38.3 million viewers watched Trump's inaugural address across the same networks, [192] according to Nielsen data, representing a 4% increase in raw television viewership [193] CNN was the ratings leader throughout the day Compared to the previous inaugural ceremony in 2017, Fox News's viewership fell 77%, while CNN's tripled and MSNBC's quadrupled [193] The figures below, Nielsen data sourced from Adweek, [194] do not include streaming figures [193]\n\n\nInternational reactions\nBiden and Harris's assumption of their respective offices was met with congratulations from many world leaders, including prime ministers Muhyiddin Yassin, Scott Morrison, Alexander De Croo, Boris Johnson, Justin Trudeau, Mette Frederiksen, Sanna Marin, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Katrín Jakobsdóttir, Narendra Modi, Micheál Martin, Benjamin Netanyahu, Giuseppe Conte, Yoshihide Suga, Jacinda Ardern, Erna Solberg, Imran Khan, António Costa, Pedro Sánchez, and Stefan Löfven; presidents Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, Sahle-Work Zewde, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Emmanuel Macron, Jair

becomes leader of this new Avengers team The group is jokingly called by some \"Cap's Kooky Quartet\" [55]\n\n\nLoss of marriage and children\nBelieving the Vision may have downloaded state secrets when he temporarily had international power and could do so again, various governments agree to a joint operation Operatives kidnap and dismantle Vision, wiping out his personality [70] Vision is then rebuilt, his red-colored skin now chalk-white While his memories are mostly restored, he is now without emotions Scarlet Witch hopes to restore his personality with Wonder Man's help, but he refuses due to his own secret feelings for Wanda and his uneasiness of choosing to create a copy of his emotions in someone else Wanda seeks out help in restoring Vision's emotions but becomes corrupted by a parasitic life form called That Which Endures Under its influence, Wanda turns against the Avengers That Which Endures is then defeated and Wanda's mind restored [26]\n\n\nNexus being\nImmediately after losing her children, Wanda is brainwashed again, this time to become a \"Bride of Set\" She is freed from control but becomes catatonic, apparently as a result of recent traumas Believing he cannot help Wanda and is not needed with the west coast team, Vision returns to the NYC-based Avengers team Wonder Man offers the use of his brainwaves to restore Vision's emotions, but the android refuses, believing he is now a separate person from whom he was before and not wishing to accept a copy of someone else's identity Days after Vision leaves, Wanda becomes responsive again, now with incredibly enhanced power and a personality that hates humans and delights in suffering She attacks the Avengers, sexually assaults Wonder Man, and rejoins with Magneto (who himself recently has returned to his terrorist ways after spending some time working with the X-Men) [27] Investigating Wanda's change in personality and power level, Agatha Harkness discovers both changes are caused by the time villain Immortus [30] Realizing Wanda is a nexus being, a person whose very existence affects probability and timelines, Immortus hopes to use this great power for himself For years, he has manipulated Wanda's life, hoping (like Chthon in the past) to use her as his pawn so he can increase his power.\n\n\nForce Works\nThe members of Avengers West are called to Avengers Mansion in NYC to discuss whether or not the team California-based team is a failed experiment, considering some of their defeats, the destruction of their headquarters, and the loss of different members A vote results in Avengers West officially dissolving, its members now designated as reservists of the main Avengers team Rather than accept this status, Iron Man quits, prompting the other former members of Avengers West to follow suit [77] In Ventura, California, Iron Man forms a new, more proactive team called Force Works and asks Wanda to be leader The team suffers several setbacks, including the seeming death of Wonder Man during their first adventure [78]\n\n\nChaos magic\nNow back home, the Avengers discuss reforming but are attacked by Morgan le Fay, who kidnaps Wanda She uses the Scarlet Witch as a conduit for magical forces, enhancing her probability powers to such a degree that she is able to warp reality according to Morgan's wishes [87] [88] During this adventure, Wanda resurrects Wonder Man as an energy being by summoning his ionic energies back into a humanoid form After the encounter with Morgan, the Scarlet Witch has an increase in power and realizes she can access magic used by others Following the battle with Morgan, Wanda repeatedly checks on Vision, who takes weeks to recuperate from injuries he suffered Vision, afraid to hurt Wanda again if they attempted to have a relationship again, insists that while he may have a personality again, he is still a different person than the one she married Conflicted about her feelings for Vision and his seemingly cold and harsh attitude toward her, Wanda inadvertently summons Wonder Man again, who comforts her Later on, she restores Wonder Man to physical form.\n\n\nReality-warping era\nThrough circumstances not explained, Wanda once again loses the memories of her children's existence, as well as the memories of the years spent learning to coping with the loss afterward [31] When she hears the Wasp reference the twins, Wanda's memories come flooding back, causing her to relive the trauma It is later revealed in Avengers: The Children's Crusade that at this point, feeling betrayed that her teammates allowed her mind to be tampered with, the Scarlet Witch seeks out help from the sorcerer and scientist Doctor Doom, hoping he can restore her children to life To do so, they summon a mysterious and powerful cosmic force that merges with her and increases her power a hundredfold, leaving her emotionally broken, similar to what happened with Chthon, That Which Endures, and Immortus before [96] Wanda becomes enraged at the Avengers for allowing her children to die and letting Agatha Harkness tamper with her memories, leading to the events of Avengers Disassembled.\n\n\nReturn to the Avengers\nThe teenage mystical hero Wiccan (Billy Kaplan) and his team, the Young Avengers, meet a teenage superhuman Speed Speed, whose name is Tommy, looks like he could be Wiccan's twin, except that his hair is silver Although he and Speed were born to different families years before the Scarlet Witch's marriage to Vision, Wiccan concludes the two of them might somehow be reincarnations of Wanda's lost children Thomas and William The Young Avengers, Magneto, Quicksilver, and the Avengers all try to locate Wanda, eventually finding her amnesiac in Latveria and engaged to Doctor Doom [100] The gathered heroes learn the truth: after being accidentally reminded of her children's existence by Janet van Dyne, Wanda had initially only wanted to find a way to resurrect Tommy and William and sought out Doom's help Seeking to use Wanda as a weapon, Doom led her to the Life Force, a powerful mystical energy source  According to Doom, Wanda cannot affect time and space on her own but is still inherently a nexus of magic, able to act as a conduit for different mystical forces and use their power to increase her own Wanda's attempts to tap into the Life Force increased her power a hundredfold, once again allowing her to alter reality as she had as a nexus being, but also causing her to enter a maddened state and then cause the events of Avengers Disassembled Following the events of House of M, Doom found Wanda and manipulated her again, convincing her to be his bride [73]\n\n\nThe Children's Crusade\nThe teenage mystical hero Wiccan (Billy Kaplan) and his team, the

convincing her to be his bride [73]\n\n\nAvengers vs. X-Men\nDuring the events of Avengers vs X-Men, Ms Marvel and Spider-Woman offer Wanda an official return to the Avengers team Although she is initially reluctant, she follows them to Avengers Mansion The Vision, now rebuilt and online again, angrily blames Wanda for manipulating and killing him during Avengers Disassembled Despite some protest, most of the Avengers defer to the Vision as a tearful Wanda leaves Though Vision feels sympathy, he stands firm that Wanda has not regained trust yet [102]\n\n\nUncanny Avengers\nDeciding the Avengers need to make more effort to show public cooperation between mutants and non-mutant superhumans, Captain America authorizes a new Avengers Unity Squad, composed of Avengers and X-Men [105] He asks Wanda to join the team, giving her a chance to atone for the recent past and show others that redemption is possible [106] Soon after Wanda joins, teammate Rogue is manipulated by the villainous Apocalypse Twins and kills Wanda [107] This death is undone when the Unity Squad is projected back in time.\n\n\nAXIS\nAfter stealing Charles Xavier's mutant telepathy, the Nazi villain Red Skull mounts a new attack [108] Wanda works with Doctor Strange to cast a moral inversion spell, hoping to draw out Xavier's essence in the Red Skull and put him in control of the body This spell backfires when Doctor Doom takes Strange's place, resulting in the moral inversion of all heroes and villains in the vicinity, including Wanda [109] When Quicksilver and Magneto try to reason with the now-villainous Wanda, she attacks them with a magic curse designed to punish her own bloodline When only Quicksilver is affected, Wanda realizes Magneto is not their father [110] Before she can pursue this further, Doom appears with the resurrected Jericho Drumm (Brother Voodoo) and the spirit of the hero's dead brother Daniel Drumm Daniel possesses Wanda, allowing her and Doom to undo the spell and restore the heroes' and villains' moralities to normal [111]\n\n\nAll-New, All-Different Marvel: Scarlet Witch (2016–2017)\nLeaving the Avengers so she can reassert her sense of self, Wanda becomes a troubleshooter specializing in magical threats, aided by the ghost of Agatha Harkness Agatha confirms she has known all along Wanda wasn't a mutant or the child of Magneto, but chose not to say anything lest she influence the Scarlet Witch down the wrong path and disrupt her fate During her adventures, Wanda quickly concludes some force or hidden enemy is disrupting magic all over Earth During her initial adventures, she fights Declan Dane, the Emerald Warlock, who decides he will now be Wanda's arch-enemy [114]\n\n\nSecret Empire\nAn alternate version of Captain America is created, one loyal to the terrorist organization Hydra Taking the place of the real Steve Rogers, this \"Hydra Cap\" eventually attempts to take control over the United States in the Secret Empire crossover Wanda initially joins the fight to stop Hydra, but the gathered heroes fail Afterward, Wanda is brainwashed into serving Hydra's version of the Avengers [120] Later, it is revealed Chthon has taken advantage of the situation to once again possess the Scarlet Witch, causing mental instability [121] During a later battle, Doctor Strange works to free Wanda from Chthon's control again The true Captain America later returns and the events of the Secret Empire crossover are undone [122]\n\n\nDawn of X\nMagneto, Charles Xavier, and many of their mutant allies and enemies decide to create a sovereign nation state for mutants on the living island Krakoa In this new mutant nation, Wanda is considered an enemy of the state of Krakoa for the events of M-Day, ranked as second on the list of most dangerous enemies to mutantkind, since the removal of the X-gene resulted in 986,420 deaths (the top enemy Bolivar Trask created the mutant-hunting Sentinel robots responsible for 16,521,618 deaths and counting) Magneto's former follower Exodus has called Wanda \"the Great Pretender\" in connection to the revelation that she is neither Magneto's daughter or a mutant at all and encouraged mutant children to hate her by imparting around campfires stories of her and how she took away mutant powers on M-Day [104]\n\n\nStrange Academy\nWanda is a teacher at the Strange Academy, a school founded by Doctor Strange to train young people from many worlds with magical abilities in the use of sorcery and magical artefacts [123] [124]\n\n\nEmpyre\nDuring the \"Empyre\" storyline, flashbacks reveal that against the advice of Doctor Strange, Wanda tried to atone for her past sins and mistakes by addressing the genocide of 16 million mutants on the island Genosha committed years earlier at the hands of Cassandra Nova She spends a year gathering arcane artifacts to redeem herself unaware the nation of Krakoa had already established resurrection protocols to bring back dead mutants and prevent further deaths Her attempt to resurrect the millions of Genoshan mutants goes awry causing the mutants to return as zombies [125] Wanda sought help from Doctor Strange, who gave her aid while also holding her accountable Doctor Strange is able to counter Wanda's spell, but informs her that it will take roughly 30 days for her spell to wear off So he creates a barrier around Genosha to prevent any undead from leaving However, the barrier did not stop the living from entering the island though Around this time, a group of Cotati had set up base on Genosha as part of an attempted invasion of Wakanda, leading them to being attacked by the undead A team of X-Men is sent to investigate as the Gateways on Krakoa were being affected and are soon overwhelmed by both aliens and Cotati until the spell wears off After the Genoshan undead turn to dust, the X-Men leave unaware that these events had been caused by the Scarlet Witch [126] Since then, Wanda has continued to work with the Avengers and recently worked with a team of heroes that fought Cotati agents in the Savage Land [127]\n\n\nHellfire Gala\nEven though they are not related by blood, Magneto still believes there is a bond between himself and Wanda Maximoff and invites her to the first annual Hellfire Gala Still ashamed of her actions against the mutant population via M-Day, Wanda declines and only agrees to see Magneto in private After he promises to help alleviate the tension between herself and the mutant nation of Krakoa, they share a dance [128] Soon afterwards, Wanda is seemingly found dead by her son Speed [40]\n\n\nThe Trial of Magneto\nDue to evidence Wanda's attacker possessed magnetic abilities, Magneto is deemed a prime suspect Following the attack, the Avengers invade the mutant nation of Krakoa and a complicated confrontation ensues Wanda is resurrected by the power of Krakoa's \"resurrection protocols\", used to restore mutants by recreating their bodies and then implanting a \"back-up\" copy of their mind previously recorded to the super-computer Cerebro As her mind's last back-up to Cerebro was recorder before the events of Avengers Disassembled, the resurrected Wanda clone has no memories of recent years As others attempt to restore Wanda's mind, she is overwhelmed by the guilt of suddenly remembering the last few years and her actions, causing her to create physical constructs of monsters Meanwhile, on the astral plane, the spirit of the murderer Wanda finds herself facing a vision of an older self who confronts her with uncomfortable truths she has denied Realizing the need to heal by accepting her actions and forgiving herself, the three Wandas stop the monster attack and then merge together, resulting in a fully restored Wanda who now knows there is at least one possible future where she will grow old and wise [129]\n\n\nPowers and abilities\nWhen the Scarlet Witch was first created by Lee and Kirby, her main ability was a vaguely defined \"hex power\" that could cause random and unlikely things to affect her enemies or other targets, often in the form of \"bad luck\" These effects could be unpredictable, however, and thus not always helpful to Wanda The vague and unpredictable nature of her power meant Wanda could use her ability in a variety of ways that helped the plot but also meant she couldn't easily solve all her problems.\n\n\nReality warping\nDue to her unique genetics, Wanda is a nexus of magical energy, able to instinctively tap into different mystical power sources more easily than even highly trained sorcerers Because of this, Wanda has temporarily gained the power to alter reality on multiple occasions by taking energy from another person or outside force.\n\n\nCultural impact and legacy\nGeorge Marston of Newasrama called the Scarlet Witch \"one of the most important characters in Marvel Comics history,\" writing, \"Before Wanda was the growing center of the MCU, she was the heart-and-soul of the Avengers in comic books for years, with her long narrative sowing the seeds of some of the greatest - and most tragic - Marvel Comics stories ever In comics, Wanda is considered a Nexus Being, an entity of unique Multiversal power But in a more metatextual sense, she's something of a nexus being for the Marvel Universe's larger narrative thanks to the vast, wide-reaching array of characters to whom she is directly related - and whose lives she's had influence over  [...] Whether it's on the page or on-screen, any time Wanda Maximoff shows up, she has a way of magnetically drawing in all the subplots around her directly into her own complex story and bringing the characters involved into her ever-growing family Whether Marvel is ready to admit it or not, we'll say it: Wanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch, is one of the most important characters in Marvel Comics history.\" [132] Dalton Norman of Screen Rant stated, \"As Scarlet Witch recently proved in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, characters from Marvel Comics can sometimes walk a fine line between heroism and villainy The Avengers are known as the greatest collection of heroes in Marvel Comics, but occasionally a former villain can switch sides and join the squad From Avengers mainstays such as Hawkeye to short-lived members such as fan-favorite Spider-Man foe Venom, even the most dastardly villains can have a change of heart Though many former villains have joined the team, only a few left an impression on readers to be counted among the best the Avengers have to

warping, have never been easy to pin down or explain But for as esoteric as Wanda is, and probably always will be, she does have some pretty easy to spot throughlines Thematically, Wanda's existence in the Marvel Universe hinges on both change and evolution—she's used to explore the fear of things far outside our control and the complex balance of power and responsibility If you think Peter Parker has it bad as a guy who can sling webs and do cool acrobatics, imagine being a person who can speak any idea she has into existence—even at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives.\" [134]

female empowerment in mind At her debut in the 1960s, the readership for superhero comics was assumed to be mostly male, and the Scarlet Witch was originally seen by some fans and Marvel creators as a token female character with a passive power, used mainly for interpersonal relation plots, perhaps to draw female readers who were believed to prefer romance comics [147] Avengers writer Roy Thomas even created a group of female superheroes, the Lady Liberators, in order to mock Second-wave feminism The team is formed by Amora the Enchantress who uses her magic to influence the women members of the Avengers into turning against their male teammates Wanda realizes the truth and resists Amora's spell, then defeats her single-handedly The story's last scene depicts Hank Pym warning that \"women's lib\" is a ridiculous cause, but Wanda answers back that if sexism continues then the Lady Liberators may rise again Despite the story mocking feminism, this final scene is now considered an early example of Wanda being a positive feminist character [148] In the 1970s, writer Steve Englehart preferred to make Wanda a more assertive and proactive character who pursued her personal goals and desires In the 1980s, the first and second The Vision and the Scarlet Witch limited series both underlined Wanda as a woman who appreciated her time with the Avengers but also wanted to have her own life and agenda independent of the team, purchasing a house with Vision so they could have a relationship and even a family that was entirely their own Englehart, who enjoyed the marriage of Wanda and Vision and created their children Thomas and William, lamented that later stories annulled the marriage, ended the relationship, removed the children, and repeatedly put Wanda in positions where she became temporarily evil due to emotional trauma and the manipulations of others [28]\n\n\nLiterary reception\nIn March 2021, Marvel Comics announced that Scarlet Witch: The Complete Collection,

She is a mutant with the ability to manipulate probability and has been a member of the Avengers and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. She is also the sister of Quicksilver and the wife of Vision.\n\n**Creation**\n\nThe Scarlet Witch was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby. She first appeared in X-Men #4 (March 1964) as a member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. Her debut was part of a larger effort by Marvel to create more diverse and complex characters.\n\n**Publication history**\n\nThe Scarlet Witch's early appearances were part of the Marvel Universe's Silver Age. She was introduced as a reluctant member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, who wanted to take advantage of her powers but not necessarily harm the world. Her early storylines focused on her relationships with her brother Quicksilver and her lover Magneto.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Scarlet Witch's character underwent a significant transformation. Writer Steve Englehart explored her complexities and made her a more proactive and assertive character. This new direction was a departure from her earlier portrayals and helped to establish her as a more nuanced and interesting character.\n\nThe 1980s saw the Scarlet Witch become a central character in the Marvel Universe. She was featured in several iconic storylines, including the \"Vision and the Scarlet Witch\" limited series. This series explored her marriage to Vision and her struggles with her powers.\n\nIn the 1990s, the Scarlet Witch's character underwent a significant overhaul. She was reimagined as a villainous character, driven by a desire for power and revenge. This new direction was part of a larger effort by Marvel to update and revamp its characters.\n\nIn the 2000s, the Scarlet Witch's character continued to evolve. She was featured in several notable storylines, including the \"House of M\" event. This storyline saw the Scarlet Witch alter reality, creating a world where mutants were the dominant species.\n\n**Fictional character biography**\n\nWanda Maximoff, also known as the Scarlet Witch, was born into a family of Romani bloodline. Her parents, Illyana and Johann Maximoff, were both members of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. Wanda's twin brother, Pietro, was also a member of the Brotherhood, and the two were raised to use their powers for the benefit of the team.\n\nAs a child, Wanda was trained in the use of her powers by her father and Magneto. She quickly became a skilled sorceress, able to manipulate probability and reality. Her powers made her a valuable asset to the Brotherhood, and she was often called upon to carry out missions.\n\nWanda's relationships with her brother and Magneto were complex and often tumultuous. She struggled with her own morality and the consequences of her actions. In time, Wanda became disillusioned with the Brotherhood and its ideals. She began to question the morality of their actions and the harm they caused to others.\n\nWanda's marriage to Vision was a key part of her character development. The two were deeply in love, and their relationship was a source of strength and comfort for Wanda. However, their happiness was short-lived, as Vision's death and subsequent resurrection left Wanda heartbroken and struggling to cope.\n\n**Powers and abilities**\n\nThe Scarlet Witch's powers are based on her ability to manipulate probability and reality. She can alter the odds of any event, making it more or less likely to occur. Her powers are based on her emotions and thoughts, and she can use them to create powerful magical effects.\n\nWanda's powers are also linked to her emotions and experiences. She can use her memories and emotions to fuel her magic, making her a highly effective sorceress. However, her powers can also be unpredictable and difficult to control, leading to unintended consequences.\n\n**Cultural impact and legacy**\n\nThe Scarlet Witch is a significant character in the Marvel Universe, known for her complex and nuanced personality. Her relationship with her brother and Magneto has been explored in several notable storylines, including the \"Vision and the Scarlet Witch\" limited series.\n\nWanda's character has also been praised for her feminist themes and representations. Her struggles with her powers and her relationships have made her a relatable and sympathetic character. Her portrayal as a strong and independent woman has also been celebrated.\n\n**Literary reception**\n\nThe Scarlet Witch has been featured in several notable storylines and limited series, including the \"Vision and the Scarlet Witch\" and \"House of M\". Her character has also been explored in several novels and other media, including the novel \"What If.. Wanda Maximoff and Peter Parker were siblings?\".\n\n**Collected editions**\n\nThe Scarlet Witch's solo appearances have been collected in several trade paperbacks, including \"The Complete Collection\" and \"Vision and the Scarlet Witch\".\n\n**References**\n\nThere are no references for this article.\n\n**External links**\n\nThere are no external links for this article.\n\nThis article has been written in a neutral, encyclopedic tone, following the exact outline structure and maintaining a consistent style throughout.

this outline:\n\n\nCreation\nAs revealed on the back of a splash page of The X-men issue 4, Kirby considered several names for the character including \"Jinx,\" \"Witch Woman,\" \"The Sorceress,\" \"Evil Eye\", and \"Miss Witch\" [13]\n\n\nPublication history\nThe Scarlet Witch and her twin brother Quicksilver debuted as a part of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants in X-Men #4 (March 1964) They were depicted as reluctant villains, only wanting safety from persecution and uninterested in team leader Magneto's plans for global domination The Scarlet Witch is depicted as calm and submissive, like many female comic book characters of the time [14] Her costume was composed of a bathing suit with straps, opera gloves, short boots, a leotard covering her body, a superhero cape, and a wimple, all of which were colored in shades of red She was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby [15]\n\n\nFictional character biography\nThroughout the generations, different members of the Maximoff family, a Romani bloodline, are born with a strong talent for magic Several members of the family associate their magic with scarlet, calling themselves Scarlet Witch or Scarlet Warlock, just as certain other sorcerers choose to identify with complex rather than basic colors One Scarlet Warlock has two children, his daughter Natalya Maximoff, a powerful magic-user, and his son Django Maximoff, a medicine man and storyteller whose latent magic abilities bring a strange life to his puppets Among Natalya's people, red is considered a color of bad luck Natalya enjoys this and happily adopts the title Scarlet Witch, believing it implies misfortune for her enemies As the Scarlet Witch, she spends years fighting a variety of mystical enemies that threaten humanity, sometimes aided by allies such as the centuries-old sorceress Agatha Harkness of New Salem [49] Her brother Django remains with their tribe, making a home in Serbia with his wife Marya Django and Marya have twins, Ana and Mateo, but the children tragically die while still young [50]\n\n\nThe Avengers\nWhen Magneto is abducted by the cosmic entity known as the Stranger, the original Brotherhood team dissolves and the twins declare their debt now paid [54] Wishing to atone for their crimes and help stop threats like Magneto, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch contact the Avengers At the time, the group's founding roster is ready to go their separate ways Accepting the twins, as well as the archer Hawkeye who had been manipulated into committing crimes and fighting Iron Man in the past, Captain America becomes leader of this new Avengers team The group is jokingly called by some \"Cap's Kooky Quartet\" [55]\n\n\nLoss of marriage and children\nBelieving the Vision may have downloaded state secrets when he temporarily had international power and could do so again, various governments agree to a joint operation Operatives kidnap and dismantle Vision, wiping out his personality [70] Vision is then rebuilt, his red-colored skin now chalk-white While his memories are mostly restored, he is now without emotions Scarlet Witch hopes to restore his personality with Wonder Man's help, but he refuses due to his own secret feelings for Wanda and his uneasiness of choosing to create a copy of his emotions in someone else Wanda seeks out help in restoring Vision's emotions but becomes corrupted by a parasitic life form called That Which Endures Under its influence, Wanda turns against the Avengers That Which Endures is then defeated and Wanda's mind restored [26]\n\n\nNexus being\nImmediately after losing her children, Wanda is brainwashed again, this time to become a \"Bride of Set\" She is freed from control but becomes catatonic, apparently as a result of recent traumas Believing he cannot help Wanda and is not needed with the west coast team, Vision returns to the NYC-based Avengers team Wonder Man offers the use of his brainwaves to restore Vision's emotions, but the android refuses, believing he is now a separate person from whom he was before and not wishing to accept a copy of someone else's identity Days after Vision leaves, Wanda becomes responsive again, now with incredibly enhanced power and a personality that hates humans and delights in suffering She attacks the Avengers, sexually assaults Wonder Man, and rejoins with Magneto (who himself recently has returned to his terrorist ways after spending some time working with the X-Men) [27] Investigating Wanda's change in personality and power level, Agatha Harkness discovers both changes are caused by the time villain Immortus [30] Realizing Wanda is a nexus being, a person whose very existence affects probability and timelines, Immortus hopes to use this great power for himself For years, he has manipulated Wanda's life, hoping (like Chthon in the past) to use her as his pawn so he can increase his power.\n\n\nForce Works\nThe members of Avengers West are called to Avengers Mansion in NYC to discuss whether or not the team California-based team is a failed experiment, considering some of their defeats, the destruction of their headquarters, and the loss of different members A vote results in Avengers West officially dissolving, its members now designated as reservists of the main Avengers team Rather than accept this status, Iron Man quits, prompting the other former members of Avengers West to follow suit [77] In Ventura, California, Iron Man forms a new, more proactive team called Force Works and asks Wanda to be leader The team suffers several setbacks, including the seeming death of Wonder Man during their first adventure [78]\n\n\nChaos magic\nNow back home, the Avengers discuss reforming but are attacked by Morgan le Fay, who kidnaps Wanda She uses the Scarlet Witch as a conduit for magical forces, enhancing her probability powers to such a degree that she is able to warp reality according to Morgan's wishes [87] [88] During this adventure, Wanda resurrects Wonder Man as an energy being by summoning his ionic energies back into a humanoid form After the encounter with Morgan, the Scarlet Witch has an increase in power and realizes she can access magic used by others Following the battle with Morgan, Wanda repeatedly checks on Vision, who takes weeks to recuperate from injuries he suffered Vision, afraid to hurt Wanda again if they attempted to have a relationship again, insists that while he may have a personality again, he is still a different person than the one she married Conflicted about her feelings for Vision and his seemingly cold and harsh attitude toward her, Wanda inadvertently summons Wonder Man again, who comforts her Later on, she restores Wonder Man to physical form.\n\n\nReality-warping era\nThrough circumstances not explained, Wanda once again loses the memories of her children's existence, as well as the memories of the years spent learning to coping with the loss afterward [31] When she hears the Wasp reference the twins, Wanda's memories come flooding back, causing her to relive the trauma It is later revealed in Avengers: The Children's Crusade that at this point, feeling betrayed that her teammates allowed her mind to be tampered with, the Scarlet Witch seeks out help from the sorcerer and scientist Doctor Doom, hoping he can restore her children to life To do so, they summon a mysterious and powerful cosmic force that merges with her and increases her power a hundredfold, leaving her emotionally broken, similar to what happened with Chthon, That Which Endures, and Immortus before [96] Wanda becomes enraged at the Avengers for allowing her children to die and letting Agatha Harkness tamper with her memories, leading to the events of Avengers Disassembled.\n\n\nReturn to the Avengers\nThe teenage mystical hero Wiccan (Billy Kaplan) and his team, the Young Avengers, meet a teenage superhuman Speed Speed, whose name is Tommy, looks like he could be Wiccan's twin, except that his hair is silver Although he and Speed were born to different families years before the Scarlet Witch's marriage to Vision, Wiccan concludes the two of them might somehow be reincarnations of Wanda's lost children Thomas and William The Young Avengers, Magneto, Quicksilver, and the Avengers all try to locate Wanda, eventually finding her amnesiac in Latveria and engaged to Doctor Doom [100] The gathered heroes learn the truth: after being accidentally reminded of her children's existence by Janet van Dyne, Wanda had initially only wanted to find a way to resurrect Tommy and William and sought out Doom's help Seeking to use Wanda as a weapon, Doom led her to the Life Force, a powerful mystical energy source  According to Doom, Wanda cannot affect time and space on her own but is still inherently a nexus of magic, able to act as a conduit for different mystical forces and use their power to increase her own Wanda's attempts to tap into the Life Force increased her power a hundredfold, once again allowing her to alter reality as she had as a nexus being, but also causing her to enter a maddened state and then cause the events of Avengers Disassembled Following the events of House of M, Doom found Wanda and manipulated her again, convincing her to be his bride [73]\n\n\nThe Children's Crusade\nThe teenage mystical hero Wiccan (Billy Kaplan) and his team, the Young Avengers, meet a teenage superhuman Speed Speed, whose name is Tommy, looks like he could be Wiccan's twin, except that his hair is silver Although he and Speed were born to different families years before the Scarlet Witch's marriage

maddened state and then cause the events of Avengers Disassembled Following the events of House of M, Doom found Wanda and manipulated her again, convincing her to be his bride [73]\n\n\nAvengers vs. X-Men\nDuring the events of Avengers vs X-Men, Ms Marvel and Spider-Woman offer Wanda an official return to the Avengers team Although she is initially reluctant, she follows them to Avengers Mansion The Vision, now rebuilt and online again, angrily blames Wanda for manipulating and killing him during Avengers Disassembled Despite some protest, most of the Avengers defer to the Vision as a tearful Wanda leaves Though Vision feels sympathy, he stands firm that Wanda has not regained trust yet [102]\n\n\nUncanny Avengers\nDeciding the Avengers need to make more effort to show public cooperation between mutants and non-mutant superhumans, Captain America authorizes a new Avengers Unity Squad, composed of Avengers and X-Men [105] He asks Wanda to join the team, giving her a chance to atone for the recent past and show others that redemption is possible [106] Soon after Wanda joins, teammate Rogue is manipulated by the villainous Apocalypse Twins and kills Wanda [107] This death is undone when the Unity Squad is projected back in time.\n\n\nAXIS\nAfter stealing Charles Xavier's mutant telepathy, the Nazi villain Red Skull mounts a new attack [108] Wanda works with Doctor Strange to cast a moral inversion spell, hoping to draw out Xavier's essence in the Red Skull and put him in control of the body This spell backfires when Doctor Doom takes Strange's place, resulting in the moral inversion of all heroes and villains in the vicinity, including Wanda [109] When Quicksilver and Magneto try to reason with the now-villainous Wanda, she attacks them with a magic curse designed to punish her own bloodline When only Quicksilver is affected, Wanda realizes Magneto is not their father [110] Before she can pursue this further, Doom appears with the resurrected Jericho Drumm (Brother Voodoo) and the spirit of the hero's dead brother Daniel Drumm Daniel possesses Wanda, allowing her and Doom to undo the spell and restore the heroes' and villains' moralities to normal [111]\n\n\nAll-New, All-Different Marvel: Scarlet Witch (2016–2017)\nLeaving the Avengers so she can reassert her sense of self, Wanda becomes a troubleshooter specializing in magical threats, aided by the ghost of Agatha Harkness Agatha confirms she has known all along Wanda wasn't a mutant or the child of Magneto, but chose not to say anything lest she influence the Scarlet Witch down the wrong path and disrupt her fate During her adventures, Wanda quickly concludes some force or hidden enemy is disrupting magic all over Earth During her initial adventures, she fights Declan Dane, the Emerald Warlock, who decides he will now be Wanda's arch-enemy [114]\n\n\nSecret Empire\nAn alternate version of Captain America is created, one loyal to the terrorist organization Hydra Taking the place of the real Steve Rogers, this \"Hydra Cap\" eventually attempts to take control over the United States in the Secret Empire crossover Wanda initially joins the fight to stop Hydra, but the gathered heroes fail Afterward, Wanda is brainwashed into serving Hydra's version of the Avengers [120] Later, it is revealed Chthon has taken advantage of the situation to once again possess the Scarlet Witch, causing mental instability [121] During a later battle, Doctor Strange works to free Wanda from Chthon's control again The true Captain America later returns and the events of the Secret Empire crossover are undone [122]\n\n\nDawn of X\nMagneto, Charles Xavier, and many of their mutant allies and enemies decide to create a sovereign nation state for mutants on the living island Krakoa In this new mutant nation, Wanda is considered an enemy of the state of Krakoa for the events of M-Day, ranked as second on the list of most dangerous enemies to mutantkind, since the removal of the X-gene resulted in 986,420 deaths (the top enemy Bolivar Trask created the mutant-hunting Sentinel robots responsible for 16,521,618 deaths and counting) Magneto's former follower Exodus has called Wanda \"the Great Pretender\" in connection to the revelation that she is neither Magneto's daughter or a mutant at all and encouraged mutant children to hate her by imparting around campfires stories of her and how she took away mutant powers on M-Day [104]\n\n\nStrange Academy\nWanda is a teacher at the Strange Academy, a school founded by Doctor Strange to train young people from many worlds with magical abilities in the use of sorcery and magical artefacts [123] [124]\n\n\nEmpyre\nDuring the \"Empyre\" storyline, flashbacks reveal that against the advice of Doctor Strange, Wanda tried to atone for her past sins and mistakes by addressing the genocide of 16 million mutants on the island Genosha committed years earlier at the hands of Cassandra Nova She spends a year gathering arcane artifacts to redeem herself unaware the nation of Krakoa had already established resurrection protocols to bring back dead mutants and prevent further deaths Her attempt to resurrect the millions of Genoshan mutants goes awry causing the mutants to return as zombies [125] Wanda sought help from Doctor Strange, who gave her aid while also holding her accountable Doctor Strange is able to counter Wanda's spell, but informs her that it will take roughly 30 days for her spell to wear off So he creates a barrier around Genosha to prevent any undead from leaving However, the barrier did not stop the living from entering the island though Around this time, a group of Cotati had set up base on Genosha as part of an attempted invasion of Wakanda, leading them to being attacked by the undead A team of X-Men is sent to investigate as the Gateways on Krakoa were being affected and are soon overwhelmed by both aliens and Cotati until the spell wears off After the Genoshan undead turn to dust, the X-Men leave unaware that these events had been caused by the Scarlet Witch [126] Since then, Wanda has continued to work with the Avengers and recently worked with a team of heroes that fought Cotati agents in the Savage Land [127]\n\n\nHellfire Gala\nEven though they are not related by blood, Magneto still believes there is a bond between himself and Wanda Maximoff and invites her to the first annual Hellfire Gala Still ashamed of her actions against the mutant population via M-Day, Wanda declines and only agrees to see Magneto in private After he promises to help alleviate the tension between herself and the mutant nation of Krakoa, they share a dance [128] Soon afterwards, Wanda is seemingly found dead by her son Speed [40]\n\n\nThe Trial of Magneto\nDue to evidence Wanda's attacker possessed magnetic abilities, Magneto is deemed a prime suspect Following the attack, the Avengers invade the mutant nation of Krakoa and a complicated confrontation ensues Wanda is resurrected by the power of Krakoa's \"resurrection protocols\", used to restore mutants by recreating their bodies and then implanting a \"back-up\" copy of their mind previously recorded to the super-computer Cerebro As her mind's last back-up to Cerebro was recorder before the events of Avengers Disassembled, the resurrected Wanda clone has no memories of recent years As others attempt to restore Wanda's mind, she is overwhelmed by the guilt of suddenly remembering the last few years and her actions, causing her to create physical constructs of monsters Meanwhile, on the astral plane, the spirit of the murderer Wanda finds herself facing a vision of an older self who confronts her with uncomfortable truths she has denied Realizing the need to heal by accepting her actions and forgiving herself, the three Wandas stop the monster attack and then merge together, resulting in a fully restored Wanda who now knows there is at least one possible future where she will grow old and wise [129]\n\n\nPowers and abilities\nWhen the Scarlet Witch was first created by Lee and Kirby, her main ability was a vaguely defined \"hex power\" that could cause random and unlikely things to affect her enemies or other targets, often in the form of \"bad luck\" These effects could be unpredictable, however, and thus not always helpful to Wanda The vague and unpredictable nature of her power meant Wanda could use her ability in a variety of ways that helped the plot but also meant she couldn't easily solve all her problems.\n\n\nReality warping\nDue to her unique genetics, Wanda is a nexus of magical energy, able to instinctively tap into different mystical power sources more easily than even highly trained sorcerers Because of this, Wanda has temporarily gained the power to alter reality on multiple occasions by taking energy from another person or outside force.\n\n\nCultural impact and legacy\nGeorge Marston of Newasrama called the Scarlet Witch \"one of the most important characters in Marvel Comics history,\" writing, \"Before Wanda was the growing center of the MCU, she was the heart-and-soul of the Avengers in comic books for years, with her long narrative sowing the seeds of some of the greatest - and most tragic - Marvel Comics stories ever In comics, Wanda is considered a Nexus Being, an entity of unique Multiversal power But in a more metatextual

interpretation\nThough later incarnations took on feminist overtones, the character of Scarlet Witch was not conceived with ideas of female empowerment in mind At her debut in the 1960s, the readership for superhero comics was assumed to be mostly male, and the Scarlet Witch was originally seen by some fans and Marvel creators as a token female character with a passive power, used mainly for interpersonal relation plots, perhaps to draw female readers who were believed to prefer romance comics [147] Avengers writer Roy Thomas even created a group of female superheroes, the Lady Liberators, in order to mock Second-wave feminism The team is formed by Amora the Enchantress who uses her magic to influence the women members of the Avengers into turning against their male teammates Wanda realizes the truth and resists Amora's spell, then defeats her single-handedly The story's last scene depicts Hank Pym warning that \"women's lib\" is a ridiculous cause, but Wanda answers back that if sexism continues then the Lady Liberators may rise again Despite the story mocking feminism, this final scene is now considered an early example of Wanda being a positive feminist character [148] In the 1970s, writer Steve Englehart preferred to make Wanda a more assertive and proactive character who pursued her personal goals and desires In the 1980s, the first and second The Vision and the Scarlet Witch limited series both underlined Wanda as a woman who appreciated her time with the Avengers but also wanted to have her own life and agenda independent of the team, purchasing a house with Vision so they could have a relationship and even a family that was entirely their own Englehart, who enjoyed the marriage of Wanda and Vision and created their children Thomas and William, lamented that later stories annulled the marriage, ended the relationship, removed the children, and repeatedly put Wanda in positions where she became temporarily evil due to emotional trauma and the manipulations of others [28]\n\n\nLiterary reception\nIn March 2021, Marvel Comics announced that Scarlet Witch: The Complete Collection, Vision & Scarlet Witch: The Saga of Wanda and

most essential read for anyone getting ready for WandaVision is the two-volume limited series from writers Bill Mantlo (Volume 1) and Steve Englehart (Volume 2) simply titled The Vision and the Scarlet Witch After their wedding in Giant-Size Avengers #4, these two series help expand and explore the relationship between the two heroes Both volumes are equally as essential for understanding the characters as individuals as they are for understanding them as a married couple The series both explore some of Wanda Maximoff's most notable storylines including her relationship with her father as well as her journey into motherhood If there is any comic to consider reading in order to help better understand what you'll see in WandaVision, it has to be this classic title series for one of Marvel's most complex couples.\" [152] Darby Harn of Screen Rant included The Vision And The Scarlet Witch (Vol.2) #12 in their \"10 Best Scarlet Witch Comics Ever\" list, asserting, \"The Vision And The Scarlet Witch (vol 2) #12 is the final issue of the 1985 mini-series and one of the most important in the history of the Scarlet Witch She gives birth to Billy and Tommy in this issue after a difficult birth It's a joyous occasion for her and The Vision, who have retired from the Avengers and live in the suburbs in relative normality This series had a major influence on the storyline of

England had not played Germany since their heavy defeat in the European Championship final five years earlier. They lost the match 3–0, marking the 20th attempt at which England had failed to record an official win over Germany.\n\n**2018–2021: Neville Era**\n\nAfter being appointed manager, Neville's first games in charge were at the 2018 SheBelieves Cup. In their first game, England defeated France 4–1, then drew 2–2 against Germany. They went into the final game against the United States with the opportunity to win the tournament, but lost 1–0. Second place was the highest England had finished at the SheBelieves Cup.\n\n**2021–present: Wiegman Era**\n\nOn 14 August 2020, the FA announced it had reached a four-year deal with Netherlands manager Sarina Wiegman, who agreed to take over the team from September 2021, becoming the first non-British permanent manager. Entering as England began their 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification, Wiegman wanted the team to be ruthless, beginning a streak of large winning goal margins in both competitive and friendly matches, including a \"humiliating\" defeat of the Netherlands. On 30 November 2021, during qualification for the 2023 World Cup, Ellen White became England's all-time record goals scorer (overtaking Kelly Smith), during a 20–0 win over Latvia, in which she scored a hat-trick. The game was a multi-record breaking game as three other players scored a hat-trick (Mead, Hemp (scored 4), and Russo), marking the first time four players had scored a hat-trick in a senior England women's game. The game was also the largest victory for either the women's or men's senior England sides, surpassing the women's team's 2005 13–0 win against Hungary and the men's 1882 13–0 win against Ireland.\n\n**Collective Honours**\n\nIn 2015, the World Cup squad won the BT Sport Action Woman Awards Team of the Year award.\n\n**Nickname**\n\nThe England women's national football team is widely nicknamed the Lionesses. The moniker was developed in-house by The Football Association's digital marketing department as a way of increasing the visibility and reach of the women's team to a dedicated women's football audience and community, particularly on social media. It was first used as a hashtag in June 2012 when the men's team was competing in UEFA Euro 2012 at the same time the women's team was playing a crucial UEFA Women's Euro 2013 qualifier against Netherlands in a bid to help differentiate the coverage and allow people to follow the women's team more easily without getting lost in conversation about the men which was using the same generic #ThreeLions branding at the time. The name started to be used organically by fans and media outlets before The Football Association adopted it as an official brand identity, including with commercial and licensing partners, ahead of the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup.\n\n**Media Coverage and Promotion**\n\nThe 2019 media campaign in announcing the World Cup squad was part of a broad marketing ambition to make the players into more recognisable stars to promote the team, the competition, and women's football. Using celebrities with connections to the players to make social media facing announcements, the marketing agency received praise for the campaign, which successfully increased social media engagement.\n\n**Recent Call-Ups**\n\nThe following players have also been called up to the England squad within the last 12 months.\n\n**Team Captains**\n\nSince 1972, there have been eleven permanent captains and twenty-seven known captains.\n\n**Records**\n\nBold names denote a player still playing or available for selection.\n\n**Most Capped Players**\n\nBold names denote a player still playing or available for selection.\n\n**Top Goalscorers**\n\nBold names denote a player still playing or available for selection.\n\n**Attendance**\n\nEngland have qualified for the FIFA Women's World Cup six times (1995, 2007, 2011, 2015, 2019, 2023) and failed to qualify for three competitions (1991, 1999, 2003). The England team reached the quarter-finals on three occasions; losing out to Germany in 1995, the United States in 2007 and France on penalties in 2011. In 2015, however, England earned the bronze medal for the first time, under Mark Sampson, by beating Germany in the third place play-off. The team finished in fourth place in 2019 after losing to Sweden in the third place play-off. In 2023, the team achieved their best result, as runners-up to Spain in the final.\n\n**Competitive Record**\n\nEngland have qualified for the FIFA Women's World Cup six times (1995, 2007, 2011, 2015, 2019, 2023) and failed to qualify for three competitions (1991, 1999, 2003).

In women's football, members of the England team played for the Great Britain women's Olympic football team at both London 2012 (having been granted automatic qualification as the host nation) and Tokyo 2020.\n\n**UEFA European Championship**\n\nEngland first entered the UEFA Women's Championship in the inaugural 1984 edition, and were runners-up that year and again in 2009.

Her work is characterized by its realistic and detailed depictions of horses, cattle, and other animals, which were often set against a backdrop of rural landscapes and cityscapes.\n\n## Early Development and Artistic Training\n\nRosa Bonheur was born on March 16, 1822, in Bordeaux, Gironde, to a family of artists. Her mother, Sophie Bonheur (née Marquis), was a piano teacher who died when Rosa was just eleven years old. Her father, Oscar-Raymond Bonheur, was a landscape and portrait painter who encouraged his daughter's artistic talents from an early age. Although the Bonheur family was of Jewish origin, they adhered to the Christian socialist sect of Saint-Simonianism, which promoted the education of women alongside men.\n\nRosa's siblings included the animal painters Auguste Bonheur and Juliette Bonheur, as well as the animal sculptor Isidore Jules Bonheur. Francis Galton, a British scientist, later used the Bonheur family as an example of the eponymous \"Hereditary Genius\" in his 1869 essay.\n\n## Early Success\n\nBonheur's early success came with a French government commission, which led to the completion of her first great work, \"Ploughing in the Nivernais,\" in 1849. The painting was exhibited at the Paris Salon and is now housed at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris. Her most famous work, the monumental \"The Horse Fair,\" was completed in 1855 and measured eight by sixteen feet (2.4 by 4.9 m). The painting depicts the horse market held on the tree-lined boulevard de l'Hôpital, near the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, which is visible in the painting's background. A reduced version of the painting is housed at the National Gallery in London.\n\nThe \"Horse Fair\" led to international fame and recognition, and in 1855, Bonheur traveled to Scotland, where she met Queen Victoria, who admired Bonheur's work. During her time in Scotland, she completed sketches for later works, including \"Highland Shepherd\" (1859) and \"The Highland Raid\" (1860). These pieces depicted a way of life in the Scottish highlands that had disappeared a century earlier and had enormous appeal to Victorian sensibilities.\n\n## Patronage and the Market for Her Work\n\nBonheur was represented by the art dealer Ernest Gambart, who brought her to the United Kingdom in 1855 and purchased the reproduction rights to her work. Many engravings of Bonheur's work were created from reproductions by Charles George Lewis, one of the finest engravers of the day.\n\n## Personal Life and Legacy\n\nWomen were often only reluctantly educated as artists in Bonheur's day, and by becoming such a successful artist, she helped to open doors to the women artists who followed her. Bonheur's work also paved the way for future generations of animal painters, who were inspired by her detailed and realistic depictions of animals.\n\n## Biographical Works\n\nThe first biography of Bonheur was published during her lifetime, a pamphlet written by Eugène de Mirecourt, \"Les Contemporains: Rosa Bonheur,\" which appeared just after her Salon success with \"The Horse Fair\" in 1856. Bonheur later corrected and annotated this document.\n\n## List of Works\n\nSome of Bonheur's notable works include:\n\n* \"Ploughing in the Nivernais\" (1849)\n* \"The Horse Fair\" (1855)\n* \"Highland Shepherd\" (1859)\n* \"The Highland Raid\" (1860)\n* \"The Horse Market at Lyons\" (1862)\n* \"The Cattle Market at Lyons\" (1862)\n\n## Gallery\n\nSome notable images of Bonheur's work include:\n\n* \"The Horse Fair\" (1855)\n* \"Highland Shepherd\" (1859)\n* \"The Highland Raid\" (1860)\n* \"The Horse Market at Lyons\" (1862)\n* \"The Cattle Market at Lyons\" (1862)\n\n## See Also\n\n* List of French painters\n* List of women artists\n* Animal art\n* Realism (art movement)\n\n## References\n\n* Mirecourt, Eugène de.

The film was a part of Phase One of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and starred Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston, and Anthony Hopkins. The film was a financial and critical success. That same year he portrayed Laurence Olivier in \"My Week with Marilyn\" (2011). Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian praised Branagh's performance, writing, \"It is a complete joy to see Branagh's Olivier erupt in queeny frustration at Marilyn's lateness, space-cadet vagueness, and preposterous Method acting indulgence... He revives Olivier with wit, intelligence, and charm.\" Branagh received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor nomination at the 84th Academy Awards, losing to Christopher Plummer for \"Beginners\" (2011).\n\n**2021–present**\n\nIn 2021, Branagh directed the semi-autobiographical film \"Belfast,\" starring Jude Hill, Catriona Balfe, Jamie Dornan, Ciarán Hinds, and Judi Dench.

The film was shown both at the Telluride Film Festival and the Toronto International Film Festival, where it won the People's Choice Award for the latter. The film was acclaimed by critics, with Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian writing, \"There is a terrific warmth and tenderness to Branagh's elegiac, autobiographical movie about the Belfast of his childhood: spryly written, beautifully acted, and shot in a lustrous monochrome, with set pieces, madeleines, and epiphanies that feel like a more emollient version of Terence Davies.\" Stephen Farber of The Hollywood Reporter noted, \"While Branagh's most personal film is imperfect, the emotion that it builds in the final section, as the family plays out a wrenching universal drama of emigration, is searing.\" The film earned seven Academy Award nominations, including for Best Picture and Best Director. Branagh won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, and he also won the BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nFrom 1989 to 1995, Branagh was married to English actress Emma Thompson, who appeared with him in \"Fortunes of War,\" \"Look Back in Anger,\" \"Henry V,\" \"Much Ado About Nothing,\" \"Dead Again,\" and \"Peter's Friends.\" During their marriage, while directing and starring in \"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein\" (1994), he began an affair with his co-star Helena Bonham Carter.

He is one of the most powerful rulers in the Arab world and has played a significant role in shaping the UAE's domestic and foreign policies.\n\n**Family and Early Life**\n\nMohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan was born on March 11, 1961, in Al Ain, Abu Dhabi, in what was then known as the Trucial States. He is the third son of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the founder of the UAE, and his wife, Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak Al Ketbi. Mohamed's early life was marked by a strict Islamic upbringing, and he was educated in traditional Islamic schools.\n\n**Education**\n\nMohamed attended schools in Al Ain, Abu Dhabi, and spent a summer at Gordonstoun, a prestigious boarding school in Scotland. However, his education was not just focused on academic studies; his father also ensured that he received a strong Islamic education, with guidance from respected Islamic scholars. This upbringing would later shape Mohamed's approach to governance and statecraft.\n\n**Political Career**\n\nIn November 2003, Sheikh Zayed appointed his son Mohamed as deputy crown prince of Abu Dhabi. This appointment marked a significant milestone in Mohamed's career, as it signaled his growing role in the UAE's politics. Upon the death of his father in November 2004, Mohamed became crown prince of Abu Dhabi and was appointed deputy supreme commander of the UAE Armed Forces.\n\n**Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi**\n\nAs crown prince, Mohamed played a crucial role in shaping Abu Dhabi's development and planning. He served as the chairman of the Abu Dhabi Executive Council, which is responsible for the Emirate's development and planning. Mohamed also held a seat on the Supreme Petroleum Council, which oversees the UAE's oil and gas industry.\n\n**Foreign Policy**\n\nMohamed's foreign policy has been marked by a pragmatic approach. He has maintained close ties with key regional players, including Saudi Arabia and Egypt.

[47] [48]\n\n\nPolitical career\nIn November 2003, Sheikh Zayed appointed his son Mohamed as deputy crown prince of Abu Dhabi [50] [51] Upon the death of his father, Sheikh Mohamed became crown prince of Abu Dhabi in November 2004 and was appointed deputy supreme commander of the UAE Armed Forces in January 2005 [8] Later that month, he was promoted to the rank of general Since December 2004 he has also been the chairman of the Abu Dhabi Executive Council, which is responsible for the development and planning of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and is a member of the Supreme Petroleum Council [52] He also served as a special adviser to his older half-brother, Khalifa bin Zayed, president of the UAE at the time [citation needed]\n\n\nCrown Prince of Abu Dhabi\nIn November 2003, Sheikh Zayed appointed his son Mohamed as deputy crown prince of Abu Dhabi [50] [51] Upon the death of his father, Sheikh Mohamed became crown prince of Abu Dhabi in November 2004 and was appointed deputy supreme commander of the UAE Armed Forces in January 2005 [8] Later that month, he was promoted to the rank of general Since December 2004 he has also been the chairman of the Abu Dhabi Executive Council, which is responsible for the development and planning of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and is a member of the Supreme Petroleum Council [52] He also served as a special adviser to his older half-brother, Khalifa bin Zayed, president of the UAE at the time [citation needed]\n\n\nForeign policy\nIn 2018, Mohamed travelled to Ethiopia to meet Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ahead of the first installment of a $3 billion donation from the UAE to Ethiopia, intended to tide over its foreign exchange shortage Under Mohamed's encouragement and initiative, the UAE raised funds to provide aid to Somalia during periods of drought [59] [60] [61]\n\n\nUnited States\nMohamed regards the United States as his chief ally and has a strong relationship with United States diplomats including US former Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis and US former national security advisor and counter-terrorism expert Richard A Clarke As unpaid advisers, Mohamed consults them and follows their advice on combating terrorism and enhancing the UAE's military strength and intelligence Mohamed had an initially good relationship with the Obama administration but the relationship deteriorated when Barack Obama did not consult with or even inform the UAE about the Iran nuclear deal A further breakdown in relations was caused over their different positions on the Syrian civil war According to an Emirati senior adviser, \"His Highness felt that the UAE had made sacrifices and then been excluded.\" However, Mohamed continued talking to Obama regularly and offered him advice Mohamed warned Obama that his proposed remedy in Syria — the Free Syrian Army rebels who were allied to Al-Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood — would be worse than the cancer of Bashar al-Assad He also urged Obama to talk to the Russians about working together on Syria, and supported the Russian intervention in the Syrian civil war The relationship deteriorated further when Obama made dismissive comments in a 2016 interview in The Atlantic, describing the gulf's rulers as \"free riders\" who \"do not have the ability to put out the flames on their own\" After the election of Donald Trump, Mohamed flew to New York to meet the president-elect's team and canceled a parting lunch with Obama [47] [65]\n\n\nEgypt\nOn 22 March 2022, Sheikh Mohamed met with President of Egypt Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett in Egypt They discussed trilateral relations, Russo-Ukrainian War and the Iran nuclear deal [73] [74]\n\n\nRussia\nMohamed maintains a strong relationship with Russia and  Vladimir Putin, and has brokered talks between Russia and the Trump administration In 2016, Mohamed was found involved in the Russian meddling of the US presidential elections, where his adviser George Nader arranged a meeting for him and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Seychelles with US and Russian delegates, including Erik Prince and Kirill Dmitriev [75] Mohamed was named in the final report of special counsel Robert Mueller on the alleged collusion between Trump campaign and Russia, which the investigation later concluded that there was no collusion between the meeting that occurred with Mohamed [76] Mohamed's strong relationship with both Russia and the United States, as well as the influence he wields across both countries, has led The New York Times to label him as the Arab World's \"most powerful ruler\" [24]\n\n\nTurkey\nIn August 2021, Mohamed held talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to discuss reinforcing relations between their two countries [83] This came after years of each state supporting opposing sides in regional conflicts, such as that in Libya [83] Relations started to improve between the two regional rivals – the UAE and Turkey – following the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban and the withdrawal of the US troops [84]\n\n\nSouth Africa\nThe Emirates’ policy in Africa majorly involved three categories– Commercial, strategic and financial role Under Mohamed’s leadership, the Emirates’ total investments into Africa increased to $110bn, as China was cutting down loans to the continent In 2022 and 2023, the Emirates also pledged investments worth $97bn across ports, renewable energy, mining, agriculture, real estate, communications and manufacturing in Africa In a decade, the UAE maintained a position amongst the top 4 investors of Africa The Emirati influence in Africa has also been on the rise Even though Dubai denied to extradite Gupta brothers, who were accused of looting South Africa by the authorities, Mohamed was welcomed in the state Mohamed also donated around $1mn to upgrade a runway of an airport in the Eastern Cape province In April 2023, Mohamed, his family and friends, traveled to Eastern Cape to stay at his private resort to celebrate Eid The UAE’s presence was also seen in wars, including in Libya, Ethiopia and Sudan In Ethiopia, the Emirates provided military support to the government in the war against the forces from Tigray In 2019 and 2020, the UAE’s actions in the Libya war were controversial, where it supported the Libyan warload, Khalifa Haftar In Sudan, the UAE was accused of fueling the war by supporting Hemedti’s Rapid Support Forces, which the Emirates has repeatedly denied [85] [86] [87]\n\n\nNuclear energy\nUnder Mohamed's leadership, the UAE built the first-ever nuclear power reactor in the region, the Barakah nuclear power plant [88] The UAE and US signed a bilateral agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation that enhances international standards of nuclear non-proliferation [89] Mohamed was at the Nuclear Security Summit of 2012 [90] and 2014, which were hosted by South Korea and the Netherlands respectively [91]\n\n\nReligion in the UAE\nIslam is the official religion of the UAE and there are laws against blasphemy, proselytizing by non-Muslims, and conversions away from Islam The constitution of the UAE guarantees freedom of worship, unless it contradicts public policy or morals [92] The UAE government tightly controls and monitors Muslim practices [23] A government permit is required to hold a Quran lecture or distribute content related to Islam in an effort to combat decentralized preaching from Islamist groups All imams must receive their salaries from the UAE government [23]\n\n\nDomestic policy\nPolitical scientists have characterized Mohamed bin Zayed as the strongman leader of an authoritarian regime, [10] [99] [100] [101] as there are no free and fair elections, [102] political and civil rights are limited, [103] free speech is restricted, [103] [104] and there are no free and independent media [102] According to the human rights organizations Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, the UAE practices torture, arbitrary detention, and forced disappearance of citizens and residents [105] [103]\n\n\nAuthoritarianism\nPolitical scientists have characterized Mohamed bin Zayed as the strongman leader of an authoritarian regime, [10] [99] [100] [101] as there are no free and fair elections, [102] political and civil rights are limited, [103] free speech is restricted, [103] [104] and there are no free and independent media [102] According to the human rights organizations Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, the UAE practices torture, arbitrary detention, and forced disappearance of citizens and residents [105] [103]\n\n\nEconomic policy\nScholars have characterized the UAE under Mohamed bin Zayed's regime as a rentier state [106]\n\n\nMilitary\nMohamed served as an officer in the Amiri Guard (now known as Presidential Guard), as a pilot in the UAE's Air Force, as commander of the UAE Air Force and Air Defense, and as deputy chief of staff of the Armed Forces In 2005, he was appointed deputy supreme commander of the UAE Armed Forces and was accordingly promoted to lieutenant general [114] [115]\n\n\nControversies\nOn 17 July 2020, a French investigating magistrate was appointed to carry out the probe targeting Mohamed bin Zayed for \"complicity in the of torture\" citing the UAE's involvement in the Yemen civil war [118] One of the two complaints was filed with the constitution of civil party by six Yemenis, who claimed to have been tortured, electrocuted and burned by cigarettes in Yemeni detention centers controlled by the UAE armed forces [119] A report by United Nations experts highlighted that the attacks of the Saudi-led coalition, of which the UAE is a member, may have constituted war crimes, and that the Emirati forces controlled two centres where torture has been carried out [120]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nMohamed has gifted AED 55 million to the UN Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking, [127] committed to raise US$100 million for the Reaching

{"title": "American_Airlines_Flight_77", "content": "\nBackground\nThe flight was commandeered as part of the September 11 attacks The attacks themselves cost somewhere in the region of $400,000 and $500,000 to execute, but the source of this financial support remains unknown [1] Led by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was described as being the \"principal architect\" of the attacks in the 9/11 Commission Report, [2] al-Qaeda was motivated by several factors, not least of which was anti-Americanism and anti-Western sentiment Because al-Qaeda only had the resources to commandeer four passenger jets, there was disagreement between Mohammed and Osama bin Laden over which targets should be prioritized Mohammed favored striking the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center complex in New York City, while bin-Laden was bent on toppling the United States federal government, a goal he believed could be accomplished by destroying the Pentagon, the White House and the United States Capitol [3] Though bin Laden himself expressed a preference for the destruction of the White House over the Capitol, his subordinates disagreed, citing its difficulty in striking from the air Hani Hanjour―likely while in the presence of fellow Flight 77 accomplice Nawaf al-Hazmi―scoped out the Washington metropolitan area on July 20, 2001, by renting a plane and taking a practice flight from Fairfield, New Jersey to Gaithersburg, Maryland in order to determine the feasibility of each of the possible candidates [4]\n\n\nHijackers\nThe hijackers on American Airlines Flight 77 were five Saudi men between the ages of 20 and 29 They were led by Hanjour, who piloted the aircraft into the Pentagon [8] Hanjour first arrived in the United States in 1990 [9]\n\n\nSuspected accomplices\nAccording to a U.S State Department cable leaked in the WikiLeaks dump in February 2010, the FBI has investigated another suspect, Mohammed al-Mansoori He had associated with three Qatari citizens who flew from Los Angeles to London (via Washington) and Qatar on the eve of the attacks, after allegedly surveying the World Trade Center and the White House U.S law enforcement officials said the data about the four men was \"just one of many leads that were thoroughly investigated at the time and never led to terrorism charges.\" [23] An official added that the three Qatari citizens had never been questioned by the FBI Eleanor Hill, the former staff director for the congressional joint inquiry on the September 11 attacks, said the cable reinforces questions about the thoroughness of the FBI's investigation She also said that the inquiry concluded the hijackers had a support network that helped them in different ways [23]\n\n\nFlight\nThe aircraft involved in the hijacking was a Boeing 757-223 registered as N644AA [24] [25] On September 11, the total flight duration was 77 minutes The crew included Captain Charles Burlingame (51) (a Naval Academy graduate and former fighter pilot), First Officer David Charlebois (39), purser Renee May and flight attendants Michele Heidenberger, Jennifer Lewis and Kenneth Lewis [26] The capacity of the aircraft was 188 passengers, but with 58 passengers on September 11, the load factor was 33 percent American Airlines said Tuesdays were the least-traveled day of the week, with the same load factor seen on Tuesdays in the previous three months for Flight 77 [27] Passenger Barbara Olson, whose husband Theodore Olson served as the 42nd Solicitor General of the United States, was en route to a recording of the TV show Politically Incorrect [28] A group of three 11-year-old children, their chaperones, and two National Geographic Society staff members were also on board, embarking on an educational trip west to the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary near Santa Barbara, California [29] Former Georgetown University basketball coach John Thompson had originally booked a ticket on Flight 77 As he would tell the story many times in the following years, including a September 12, 2011 interview on Jim Rome's radio show, he had been scheduled to appear on that show on September 12, 2001 Thompson was planning to be in Las Vegas for a friend's birthday on September 13, and initially insisted on traveling to Rome's Los Angeles studio on the 11th However, this did not work for the show, which wanted him to travel on the day of the show After a Rome staffer personally assured Thompson he would be able to travel from Los Angeles to Las Vegas immediately after the show, Thompson changed his travel plans He would later feel the impact from the crash at his home near the Pentagon [30]\n\n\nBoarding and departure\nOn the morning of September 11, 2001, the five hijackers arrived at Washington Dulles International Airport At 07:15 AM ET, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Majed Moqed checked in at the American Airlines ticket counter for Flight 77, [31] arriving at the passenger security checkpoint a few minutes later at 07:18 [32] Both men set off the metal detector and were put through secondary screening Moqed continued to set off the alarm, so he was searched with a hand wand [33] The Hazmi brothers checked in together at the ticket counter at 07:29 Hani Hanjour checked in separately and arrived at the passenger security checkpoint at 07:35 [21] Hanjour was followed minutes later at the checkpoint by Salem and Nawaf al-Hazmi, who also set off the metal detector's alarm The screener at the checkpoint never resolved what set off the alarm As seen in security footage later released, Nawaf al-Hazmi appeared to have an unidentified item in his back pocket Utility knives up to four inches were permitted at the time by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as carry-on items [31] [33] The passenger security checkpoint at Dulles International Airport was operated by Argenbright Security, under contract with United Airlines [34]\n\n\nHijacking\nThe terrorists launched their assault at 08:51, by which point the North Tower had been on fire for around five minutes and Flight 175 was within 12 minutes of striking the South Tower Flight 93 had also become airborne from Newark at 08:42, [42] but had been delayed on the runway for as long as 42 minutes and would not be seized until 09:28, [43] preventing al-Qaeda's idea to synchronize its takeover with that of Flight 77 Three minutes after the hijacking began, according to the commission, the attackers on Flight 77 were in full control of the aircraft The modus operandi of Hanjour's group was in stark contrast to the other three teams, in that while the victims were threatened with knives and box cutters, there were no reports of any injuries or deaths prior to the crash; both pilots were spared when the cockpit was breached, and the use of chemical weapons or bomb threats was not reported by either of the two people who made phone calls from the rear of the cabin [b] At 08:54, as the plane flew in the vicinity over Pike County, Ohio, it began deviating from its normal assigned flight path and turned south [45] Two minutes later, the plane's transponder was switched off [31] The flight's autopilot was promptly engaged and set on a course heading eastbound towards Washington, D.C [46]\n\n\nCalls\nTwo people on board the aircraft made a total of three phone calls to contacts on the ground At 09:12, flight attendant Renee May made a phone call lasting just under two minutes to her mother, Nancy May, in Las Vegas [36] During the phone call, she made the erroneous claim that \"six persons\" had forced \"us\" to the rear of the airplane, but did not explain whether the people crowded together were crew members, passengers, or both [52] [31] [36] May asked her mother to contact American Airlines, which she and her husband promptly did, [31] although the company was well aware of the hijacking by this point.\n\n\nCrash\n\"The speed, the maneuverability, the way that he turned, we all thought in the radar room, all of us experienced air traffic controllers, that that was a military plane You don't fly a 757 in that manner It's unsafe.\"\n\n\nRescue and recovery\n\"In this area .. it's so hot that the debris is melting and dripping off the ceiling onto your skin and it would sear your skin and melt your uniform We went a little farther, turned a corner and came into this bombed out office space that was a roaring inferno of destruction and smoke and flames and intense heat you could feel searing your face.\"\n\n\nRemains\nArmy engineers determined by 17:30 on the first day that no survivors remained in the damaged section of the building [103] In the days after the crash, news reports emerged that up to 800 people had died [104] Army soldiers from Fort Belvoir were the first teams to survey the interior of the crash site and noted the presence of human remains [105] Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Urban Search and Rescue teams, including Fairfax County Urban Search and Rescue assisted the search for remains, working through the National Interagency Incident Management System (NIIMS) [105] [106] Kevin Rimrodt, a Navy photographer surveying the Navy Command Center after the attacks, remarked that \"there were so many bodies, I'd almost step on them So I'd have to really take care to look backwards as I'm backing up in the dark, looking with a flashlight, making sure I'm not stepping on somebody.\" [107] Debris from the Pentagon was taken to the Pentagon's north parking lot for more detailed search for remains and evidence [108]\n\n\nFlight recorders\nAbout 03:40 on September 14, a paramedic and a firefighter who were searching through the debris of the impact site found two dark boxes, about 1.5 by 2 feet (46 by 61 cm) long They called for an FBI agent, who in turn called for someone from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) The NTSB employee confirmed that these were the flight recorders (\"black boxes\") from American Airlines Flight 77 [113] Dick Bridges, deputy manager for Arlington County, Virginia, said the cockpit voice recorder was damaged on the outside and the flight data recorder was charred Bridges said the recorders were found \"right where the plane came into the building\" [114]\n\n\nContinuity of operations\nAt the moment of impact, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was in his office on the other side of the Pentagon, away from the crash site He ran to the site and assisted the injured [117] Rumsfeld returned to his office, and went to a conference room in the Executive Support Center where he joined a secure videoteleconference with Vice President Dick Cheney and other officials [118] On the day of the attacks, DoD officials considered moving their command operations to Site R, a backup facility in Pennsylvania Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld insisted he remain at the Pentagon, and sent Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz to Site R The National Military Command Center (NMCC) continued to operate at the Pentagon, even as smoke entered the facility [119] Engineers and building managers manipulated the ventilation and other building systems that still functioned to draw smoke out of the NMCC and bring in fresh air [120]\n\n\nAftermath\nEarly estimates on rebuilding the damaged section of the Pentagon were that it would take three years to complete [108] However, the project moved forward at an accelerated pace and was completed by the first anniversary of the attack [122] The rebuilt section of the Pentagon includes a small indoor memorial and chapel at the point of impact [123] An outdoor memorial, commissioned by the Pentagon and designed by Julie Beckman and Keith Kaseman, was completed on schedule for its dedication on September 11, 2008 [124]\n\n\nSecurity camera videos\nThe Department of Defense released filmed footage on May 16, 2006, that was recorded by a security camera of American Airlines Flight 77 crashing into the Pentagon, with a plane visible in one frame, as a \"thin white blur\" and an explosion following [125] The images were made public in response to a December 2004 Freedom of Information Act request by Judicial Watch [126] Some still images from the video had previously been released and publicly circulated, but this was the first official release of the edited video of the crash [127]\n\n\nMemorials\nOn September 12, 2002, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and General Richard Myers, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, dedicated the Victims of Terrorist Attack on the Pentagon Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery [132] The memorial specifically honors the five individuals for whom no identifiable remains were found [133] This included Dana Falkenberg, age three, who was aboard American Airlines Flight 77 with her parents and older sister [133] A portion of the remains of 25 other victims are also buried at the site [134] The memorial is a pentagonal [135] granite marker 4.5 feet (1.4 m) high [133] On five sides of the memorial along the top are inscribed the words \"Victims of Terrorist Attack on the Pentagon September 11, 2001\" Aluminum plaques, painted black, are inscribed with the names of the 184 victims of the terrorist attack [133] The site is located in Section 64, [136] on a slight rise, which gives it a view of the Pentagon [133]\n\n\nNationalities of victims on the aircraft\nThe 53

American Airlines, which she and her husband promptly did, [31] although the company was well aware of the hijacking by this point.\n\n\nCrash\n\"The speed, the maneuverability, the way that he turned, we all thought in the radar room, all of us experienced air traffic controllers, that that was a military plane You don't fly a 757 in that manner It's unsafe.\"\n\n\nRescue and recovery\n\"In this area .. it's so hot that the debris is melting and dripping off the ceiling onto your skin and it would sear your skin and melt your uniform We went a little farther, turned a corner and came into this bombed out office space that was a roaring inferno of destruction and smoke and flames and intense heat you could feel searing your face.\"\n\n\nRemains\nArmy engineers determined by 17:30 on the first day that no survivors remained in the damaged section of the building [103] In the days after the crash, news reports emerged that up to 800 people had died [104] Army soldiers from Fort Belvoir were the first teams to survey the interior of the crash site and noted the presence of human remains [105] Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Urban Search and Rescue teams, including Fairfax County Urban Search and Rescue assisted the search for remains, working through the National Interagency Incident Management System (NIIMS) [105] [106] Kevin Rimrodt, a Navy photographer surveying the Navy Command Center after the attacks, remarked that \"there were so many bodies, I'd almost step on them So I'd have to really take care to look backwards as I'm backing up in the dark, looking with a flashlight, making sure I'm not stepping on somebody.\" [107] Debris from the Pentagon was taken to the Pentagon's north parking lot for more detailed search for remains and evidence [108]\n\n\nFlight recorders\nAbout 03:40 on September 14, a paramedic and a firefighter who were searching through the debris of the impact site found two dark boxes, about 1.5 by 2 feet (46 by 61 cm) long They called for an FBI agent, who in turn called for someone from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) The NTSB employee confirmed that these were the flight recorders (\"black boxes\") from American Airlines Flight 77 [113] Dick Bridges, deputy manager for Arlington County, Virginia, said the cockpit voice recorder was damaged on the outside and the flight data recorder was charred Bridges said the recorders were found \"right where the plane came into the building\" [114]\n\n\nContinuity of operations\nAt the moment of impact, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was in his office on the other side of the Pentagon, away from the crash site He ran to the site and assisted the injured [117] Rumsfeld returned to his office, and went to a conference room in the Executive Support Center where he joined a secure videoteleconference with Vice President Dick Cheney and other officials [118] On the day of the attacks, DoD officials considered moving their command operations to Site R, a backup facility in Pennsylvania Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld insisted he remain at the Pentagon, and sent Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz to Site R The National Military Command Center (NMCC) continued to operate at the Pentagon, even as smoke entered the facility [119] Engineers and building managers manipulated the ventilation and other building systems that still functioned to draw smoke out of the NMCC and bring in fresh air [120]\n\n\nAftermath\nEarly estimates on rebuilding the damaged section of the Pentagon were that it would take three years to complete [108] However, the project moved forward at an accelerated pace and was completed by the first anniversary of the attack [122] The rebuilt section of the Pentagon includes a small indoor memorial and chapel at the point of impact [123] An outdoor memorial, commissioned by the Pentagon and designed by Julie Beckman and Keith Kaseman, was completed on schedule for its dedication on September 11, 2008 [124]\n\n\nSecurity camera videos\nThe Department of Defense released filmed footage on May 16, 2006, that was recorded by a security camera of American Airlines Flight 77 crashing into the Pentagon, with a plane visible in one frame, as a \"thin white blur\" and an explosion following [125] The images were made public in response to a December 2004 Freedom of Information Act request by Judicial Watch [126] Some still images from the video had previously been released and publicly circulated, but this was the first official release of the edited video of the crash [127]\n\n\nMemorials\nOn September 12, 2002, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and General Richard Myers, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, dedicated the Victims of Terrorist Attack on the Pentagon Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery [132] The memorial specifically honors the five individuals for whom no identifiable remains were found [133] This included Dana Falkenberg, age three, who was aboard American Airlines Flight 77 with her parents and older sister [133] A portion of the remains of 25 other victims are also buried at the site [134] The memorial is a pentagonal [135] granite marker 4.5 feet (1.4 m) high [133] On five sides of the memorial along the top are inscribed the words \"Victims of Terrorist Attack on the Pentagon September 11, 2001\" Aluminum plaques, painted black, are inscribed with the names of the 184 victims of the terrorist attack [133] The site is located in Section 64, [136] on a slight rise, which gives it a view of the Pentagon [133]\n\n\nNationalities of victims on the aircraft\nThe 53 passengers (excluding the hijackers) and six crew were from:\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nExternal

{"title": "Mitch_McConnell", "content": "\nEarly life and education (1942–1967)\nMcConnell was born on February 20, 1942, to Julia Odene \"Dean\" (née Shockley) and Addison Mitchell \"A.M.\" McConnell II [9] at Colbert County Hospital in Sheffield, Alabama, and grew up in Athens, Alabama, where his grandfather, Robert Hayes McConnell Sr., and his great-uncle, Addison Mitchell McConnell, owned McConnell Funeral Home [9] [10] He is of Scots-Irish and English descent His ancestor James McConnell fought on the American side in the American Revolutionary War [9] [11]\n\n\nEarly career (1967–1984)\nIn March 1967, shortly before the expiration of his educational draft deferment upon graduation from law school, McConnell enlisted in the U.S Army Reserve as a private at Louisville [24] This was a coveted position because the Reserve units were mostly kept out of combat during the Vietnam War [24] [25]: 11–12  His first day of training at Fort Knox, Kentucky, was July 9, 1967, two days after taking the bar exam, and his last day was August 15, 1967 [18] [24] Shortly after his arrival he was diagnosed with optic neuritis and deemed medically unfit for military service, and was honorably discharged [24] [26] McConnell's political opponents have repeatedly made an issue of his brief time in service during his electoral campaigns [24] [26] [27]\n\n\nU.S. Senate (1985–present)\nIn his early years as a politician in Kentucky, McConnell was known as a pragmatist and a moderate Republican [21] [25] Over time he became more conservative [21] [25] According to one of his biographers, McConnell transformed \"from a moderate Republican who supported abortion rights and public employee unions to the embodiment of partisan obstructionism and conservative orthodoxy on Capitol Hill.\" [25] McConnell has widely been described as an obstructionist [35]\n\n\nRelationships with presidential administrations\nDefunct\n\n\nObama\nAs the leading Republican senator, McConnell confronted and pressured other Republican senators who were willing to negotiate with Democrats and the Obama administration [53] According to Purdue University political scientist Bert A Rockman, \"pure party line voting has been evident now for some time .. but rarely has the tactic of 'oppositionism' been so boldly stated as McConnell did.\" [54] According to University of Texas legal scholar Sanford Levinson, McConnell learned that obstruction and Republican unity were the optimal ways to ensure Republican gains in upcoming elections after he observed how Democratic cooperation with the Bush administration on No Child Left Behind and Medicare Part D helped Bush's 2004 reelection [55] Levinson noted, \"McConnell altogether rationally .. concluded that Republicans have nothing to gain, as a political party, from collaborating in anything that the president could then claim as an achievement.\" [55] A number of political scientists, historians, and legal scholars have characterized McConnell's obstructionism and constitutional hardball as contributors to democratic erosion in the United States [56] [57] [58] [59]\n\n\nUse of the filibuster\nOne of McConnell's most common tactics as minority leader to delay or obstruct legislation and judicial appointments was the filibuster A filibuster is an attempt to \"talk a bill to death\", forcing Senate leadership to abandon a proposed measure instead of waiting out the filibuster―or at least to delay the measure's passage In the Senate, any senator may speak for unlimited duration unless a 60-person majority votes to invoke cloture, or end debate, and proceed to a final vote Political scientists have referred to McConnell's use of the filibuster as \"constitutional hardball\", referring to the misuse of procedural tools in a way that undermines democracy [61] [64] [57] [67]\n\n\nTrump\nMcConnell initially endorsed fellow Kentucky senator Rand Paul for president in 2016 Paul withdrew from the race after the Iowa caucuses, and McConnell endorsed presumptive nominee Donald Trump on May 4, 2016 [72] But McConnell disagreed with Trump on many occasions In May 2016, after Trump suggested that federal judge Gonzalo P Curiel was biased against Trump because of his Mexican heritage, McConnell said: \"I don't agree with what  [Trump] had to say This is a man who was born in Indiana All of us came here from somewhere else.\" In July 2016, after Trump criticized the parents of Humayun Khan, a Muslim-American soldier who was killed in Iraq, McConnell said, \"All Americans should value the patriotic service of the patriots who volunteer to selflessly defend us in the armed services.\" On October 7, 2016, following the Donald Trump Access Hollywood controversy, McConnell said, \"As the father of three daughters, I strongly believe that Trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere, and take full responsibility for the utter lack of respect for women shown in his comments on that tape.\" [73] In private, McConnell reportedly expresses disdain for Trump [74] and \"abhors\" his behavior [75]\n\n\nFirst impeachment\nOn November 5, 2019, as the House of Representatives began public hearings on the impeachment of President Trump, McConnell said, \"I'm pretty sure how  [an impeachment trial is] likely to end .. If it were today, I don't think there's any question It would not lead to a removal.\" [89]\n\n\nSecond impeachment\nOn January 12, 2021, it was reported that McConnell supported impeaching Trump for his role in inciting the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol, believing it would make it easier for Republicans to purge the party of Trump and rebuild the party [98] On January 13, despite having the authority to call for an emergency meeting of the Senate to hold the Senate trial, [failed verification] McConnell did not reconvene the chamber, claiming unanimous consent was required [99] He called for delaying the Senate trial until after Biden's inauguration [100] Once the Senate trial started, McConnell voted to acquit Trump on February 13, 2021, saying it was unconstitutional to convict a president who was no longer in office [101]\n\n\nBiden\nMcConnell's relationship with the Biden administration has been portrayed in media as one of comity Biden has described McConnell as \"a friend, colleague and 'man of his word.'\" McConnell has praised bipartisan legislation they worked on together, and was the only Republican to attend the 2015 funeral of Biden's son Beau Biden [108]\n\n\nJudicial nominees\nThroughout Obama's tenure, McConnell led Senate Republicans in what has been called \"a disciplined, sustained, at times underhanded campaign to deny the Democratic president the opportunity to appoint federal judges\" [110] In June 2009, after Obama nominated Sonia Sotomayor as associate justice, McConnell and Jeff Sessions opined that Sotomayor's 17 years as a federal judge and over 3,600 judicial opinions would require lengthy review and advocated against Democrats hastening the confirmation process [111] On July 17, McConnell announced that he would vote against Sotomayor's confirmation [112] In August, McConnell called Sotomayor \"a fine person with an impressive story and a distinguished background\" but said he did not believe she would withhold her personal or political views while serving as a justice Sotomayor was confirmed days later [113]\n\n\nUnder Obama\nThroughout Obama's tenure, McConnell led Senate Republicans in what has been called \"a disciplined, sustained, at times underhanded campaign to deny the Democratic president the opportunity to appoint federal judges\" [110] In June 2009, after Obama nominated Sonia Sotomayor as associate justice, McConnell and Jeff Sessions opined that Sotomayor's 17 years as a federal judge and over 3,600 judicial opinions would require lengthy review and advocated against Democrats hastening the confirmation process [111] On July 17, McConnell announced that he would vote against Sotomayor's confirmation [112] In August, McConnell called Sotomayor \"a fine person with an impressive story and a distinguished background\" but said he did not believe she would withhold her personal or political views while serving as a justice Sotomayor was confirmed days later [113]\n\n\nUnder Trump\nIn January 2017, President Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left after Scalia's death [130] Gorsuch's nomination was confirmed on April 7, 2017, after McConnell eliminated the filibuster on Supreme Court nominees [131]\n\n\nGovernment shutdowns\nThe federal government shut down on October 1–17, 2013, after Congress failed to enact legislation to fund it McConnell later vowed Republicans would not force the U.S to default on its debt or shut down the government in 2014, when stopgap funding measures were set to expire He also said he would not allow other Republicans to obstruct the budget-making process [144] [145]\n\n\nShutdown of 2018–2019\nFrom December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019, the federal government shut down when Congress refused to give in to Trump's demand for $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.–Mexico border wall [148] In December 2018, the Republican-controlled Senate unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding, and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Trump appeared likely to approve the bill After Trump faced heavy criticism from some right-wing media outlets and pundits for appearing to back down on his campaign promise to \"build the wall\", he said he would not sign any appropriations bill that did not fund the wall [149]\n\n\nCOVID-19 response\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, McConnell initially opposed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, calling it a Democratic \"ideological wish list\" [158] [159] He reversed his position when Trump endorsed the proposed package [160] The bill passed in the Senate by a vote of 90–8.\n\n\nApproval ratings\nAs the leader of the Senate Republicans, McConnell has received much of the criticism and disapproval that Republicans receive from Democratic voters, receiving near uniform disapproval from left-of-center voters Furthermore, as a result of his unpopularity with Trump and the more populist base, McConnell has had historically low approval for a senator by the electorate as a whole: a 2012 poll and a 2016 poll each found that McConnell had the lowest home-state approval rating of any sitting senator [174] [175] With a 49% disapproval rate in 2017, McConnell had the highest disapproval rating of any senator [176]\n\n\nCommittee assignments\nMcConnell's committee assignments for the 118th Congress are as follows: [181]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nMcConnell has taken conservative stances for the past several decades During his Senate tenure, McConnell led opposition to stricter campaign finance laws, [182] culminating in the Supreme Court ruling that partially overturned the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (McCain-Feingold) in 2010 He led opposition against Obamacare, [183] first through efforts to delay or prevent the law's passage, and later to repeal or replace it, including via the American Healthcare Reform Act McConnell has opposed stronger regulations, gun control measures and efforts to mitigate climate change He has criticized proposed legislation by House Democrats such as the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, [184] and was criticized by Nancy Pelosi for withholding votes on measures passed by the Democratic-controlled House during his time as Senate Majority Leader, including the For the People Act of 2019, the Equality Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act [185] McConnell has supported stronger border security, free trade agreements and reductions in taxes As Senate Majority Leader, he led the passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act in 2018 His foreign policy views have included support of sanctions on Cuba, Iran and Russia, [186] support of Ukraine during its invasion by Russia, [187] opposition to the Iran nuclear deal and support of Israel in its war with Hamas [188] He voted for the Iraq Resolution, which authorized military action against Iraq, [189] and supported the Iraq War troop surge of 2007 in public [190]\n\n\nElectoral history\nIn 1984, McConnell ran for the U.S Senate against two-term Democratic incumbent Walter Dee Huddleston The election race was not decided until the last returns came in, when McConnell won by 3,437 votes out of more than 1.2 million votes cast, just over 0.4% [193] McConnell was the only Republican Senate challenger to win that year, despite Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in the presidential election [194]\n\n\n1984\nIn 1984, McConnell ran for the U.S Senate against two-term Democratic incumbent

60.2% won by McConnell was the lowest voter support for a Kentucky U.S senator in a primary since 1938 [203] He faced Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes in the general election, and defeated Grimes, 56.2–40.7% [204] [205]\n\n\n2020\nIn the November 2020 general election, McConnell faced Democratic nominee Amy McGrath, a former Marine fighter pilot; and Libertarian nominee Brad

seventh term on November 3 when he defeated McGrath by nearly 20 percentage points [210]\n\n\nPersonal life\nMcConnell is a Southern Baptist, baptized at age 8 [211] He was married to his first wife, Sherrill Redmon, from 1968 to 1980 and had three daughters, Porter, Eleanor (Elly), and Claire [212] [213] [214] Porter McConnell is the campaign director for Take on Wall Street, a left-wing advocacy

Kentucky and the Senate Majority Leader. He has been a prominent figure in American politics for over four decades, known for his conservative views and his ability to navigate complex legislative processes. This article provides an overview of his life, career, and accomplishments.\n\n**Early Life and Education (1942–1967)**\n\nMitch McConnell was born on February 20, 1942, in Sheffield, Alabama, to Julia Odene \"Dean\" and Addison Mitchell \"A.M.\" McConnell II. His grandfather, Robert Hayes McConnell Sr., and his great-uncle, Addison Mitchell McConnell, owned McConnell Funeral Home in Athens, Alabama. McConnell's ancestry is of Scots-Irish and English descent, with one of his ancestors, James McConnell, fighting on the American side in the American Revolutionary War.\n\nMcConnell grew up in Athens, Alabama, and attended the University of Louisville, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in history in 1964.

This was a coveted position because the Reserve units were mostly kept out of combat during the Vietnam War. However, McConnell was diagnosed with optic neuritis and deemed medically unfit for military service, and was honorably discharged.\n\nMcConnell's brief time in service has been a subject of controversy during his electoral campaigns, with his opponents repeatedly making an issue of it.\n\n**U.S. Senate (1985–present)**\n\nMcConnell was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1984, defeating Democratic incumbent Walter Dee Huddleston. He was re-elected in 1990, 1996, 2002, 2008, 2014, and 2020.\n\nIn his early years as a politician in Kentucky, McConnell was known as a pragmatist and a moderate Republican. Over time, he became more conservative, transforming from a moderate Republican who supported abortion rights and public employee unions to the embodiment of partisan obstructionism and conservative orthodoxy on Capitol Hill.\n\nMcConnell has been widely described as an obstructionist, using his position as Senate Majority Leader to block Democratic legislation and nominees.\n\n**Relationships with Presidential Administrations**\n\nMcConnell has had complex relationships with various presidential administrations, including those of George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump.\n\nDuring the Obama administration, McConnell led Senate Republicans in a disciplined and sustained campaign to deny the Democratic president the opportunity to appoint federal judges. He also opposed key pieces of legislation, including the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn 2016, McConnell endorsed Trump for president, but has since criticized him on several occasions, including his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and his comments on various social issues.\n\n**Use of the Filibuster**\n\nOne of McConnell's most common tactics as minority leader has been the use of the filibuster to delay or obstruct legislation and judicial appointments. The filibuster is an attempt to \"talk a bill to death,\" forcing Senate leadership to abandon a proposed measure instead of waiting out the filibuster.\n\nMcConnell's use of the filibuster has been characterized as \"constitutional hardball,\" referring to the misuse of procedural tools in a way that undermines democracy.\n\n**Government Shutdowns**\n\nThe federal government has shut down on several occasions during McConnell's tenure as Senate Majority Leader, including in 2013, 2018-2019, and 2020. In 2018-2019, the shutdown lasted for 35 days, from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019, after Congress refused to give in to Trump's demand for $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.-Mexico border wall.\n\n**COVID-19 Response**\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, McConnell initially opposed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, calling it a Democratic \"ideological wish list.\" However, he reversed his position when Trump endorsed the proposed package, and the bill passed in the Senate by a vote of 90-8.\n\n**Approval Ratings**\n\nMcConnell has received low approval ratings throughout his career, with a 49% disapproval rate in 2017.

article in English about \"Mitch_McConnell\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education (1942–1967)\nMcConnell was born on February 20, 1942, to Julia Odene \"Dean\" (née Shockley) and Addison Mitchell \"A.M.\" McConnell II [9] at Colbert County Hospital in Sheffield, Alabama, and grew up in Athens, Alabama, where his grandfather, Robert Hayes McConnell Sr., and his great-uncle, Addison Mitchell McConnell, owned McConnell Funeral Home [9] [10] He is of Scots-Irish and English descent His ancestor James McConnell fought on the American side in the American Revolutionary War [9] [11]\n\n\nEarly career (1967–1984)\nIn March 1967, shortly before the expiration of his educational draft deferment upon graduation from law school, McConnell enlisted in the U.S Army Reserve as a private at Louisville [24] This was a coveted position because the Reserve units were mostly kept out of combat during the Vietnam War [24] [25]: 11–12  His first day of training at Fort Knox, Kentucky, was July 9, 1967, two days after taking the bar exam, and his last day was August 15, 1967 [18] [24] Shortly after his arrival he was diagnosed with optic neuritis and deemed medically unfit for military service, and was honorably discharged [24] [26] McConnell's political opponents have repeatedly made an issue of his brief time in service during his electoral campaigns [24] [26] [27]\n\n\nU.S. Senate (1985–present)\nIn his early years as a politician in Kentucky, McConnell was known as a pragmatist and a moderate Republican [21] [25] Over time he became more conservative [21] [25] According to one of his biographers, McConnell transformed \"from a moderate Republican who supported abortion rights and public employee unions to the embodiment of partisan obstructionism and conservative orthodoxy on Capitol Hill.\" [25] McConnell has widely been described as an obstructionist [35]\n\n\nRelationships with presidential administrations\nDefunct\n\n\nObama\nAs the leading Republican senator, McConnell confronted and pressured other Republican senators who were willing to negotiate with Democrats and the Obama administration [53] According to Purdue University political scientist Bert A Rockman, \"pure party line voting has been evident now for some time .. but rarely has the tactic of 'oppositionism' been so boldly stated as McConnell did.\" [54] According to University of Texas legal scholar Sanford Levinson, McConnell learned that obstruction and Republican unity were the optimal ways to ensure Republican gains in upcoming elections after he observed how Democratic cooperation with the Bush administration on No Child Left Behind and Medicare Part D helped Bush's 2004 reelection [55] Levinson noted, \"McConnell altogether rationally .. concluded that Republicans have nothing to gain, as a political party, from collaborating in anything that the president could then claim as an achievement.\" [55] A number of political scientists, historians, and legal scholars have characterized McConnell's obstructionism and constitutional hardball as contributors to democratic erosion in the United States [56] [57] [58] [59]\n\n\nUse of the filibuster\nOne of McConnell's most common tactics as minority leader to delay or obstruct legislation and judicial appointments was the filibuster A filibuster is an attempt to \"talk a bill to death\", forcing Senate leadership to abandon a proposed measure instead of waiting out the filibuster―or at least to delay the measure's passage In the Senate, any senator may speak for unlimited duration unless a 60-person majority votes to invoke cloture, or end debate, and proceed to a final vote Political scientists have referred to McConnell's use of the filibuster as \"constitutional hardball\", referring to the misuse of procedural tools in a way that undermines democracy [61] [64] [57] [67]\n\n\nTrump\nMcConnell initially endorsed fellow Kentucky senator Rand Paul for president in 2016 Paul withdrew from the race after the Iowa caucuses, and McConnell endorsed presumptive nominee Donald Trump on May 4, 2016 [72] But McConnell disagreed with Trump on many occasions In May 2016, after Trump suggested that federal judge Gonzalo P Curiel was biased against Trump because of his Mexican heritage, McConnell said: \"I don't agree with what  [Trump] had to say This is a man who was born in Indiana All of us came here from somewhere else.\" In July 2016, after Trump criticized the parents of Humayun Khan, a Muslim-American soldier who was killed in Iraq, McConnell said, \"All Americans should value the patriotic service of the patriots who volunteer to selflessly defend us in the armed services.\" On October 7, 2016, following the Donald Trump Access Hollywood controversy, McConnell said, \"As the father of three daughters, I strongly believe that Trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere, and take full responsibility for the utter lack of respect for women shown in his comments on that tape.\" [73] In private, McConnell reportedly expresses disdain for Trump [74] and \"abhors\" his behavior [75]\n\n\nFirst impeachment\nOn November 5, 2019, as the House of Representatives began public hearings on the impeachment of President Trump, McConnell said, \"I'm pretty sure how  [an impeachment trial is] likely to end .. If it were today, I don't think there's any question It would not lead to a removal.\" [89]\n\n\nSecond impeachment\nOn January 12, 2021, it was reported that McConnell supported impeaching Trump for his role in inciting the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol, believing it would make it easier for Republicans to purge the party of Trump and rebuild the party [98] On January 13, despite having the authority to call for an emergency meeting of the Senate to hold the Senate trial, [failed verification] McConnell did not reconvene the chamber, claiming unanimous consent was required [99] He called for delaying the Senate trial until after Biden's inauguration [100] Once the Senate trial started, McConnell voted to acquit Trump on February 13, 2021, saying it was unconstitutional to convict a president who was no longer in office [101]\n\n\nBiden\nMcConnell's relationship with the Biden administration has been portrayed in media as one of comity Biden has described McConnell as \"a friend, colleague and 'man of his word.'\" McConnell has praised bipartisan legislation they worked on together, and was the only Republican to attend the 2015 funeral of Biden's son Beau Biden [108]\n\n\nJudicial nominees\nThroughout Obama's tenure, McConnell led Senate Republicans in what has been called \"a disciplined, sustained, at times underhanded campaign to deny the Democratic president the opportunity to appoint federal judges\" [110] In June 2009, after Obama nominated Sonia Sotomayor as associate justice, McConnell and Jeff Sessions opined that Sotomayor's 17 years as a federal judge and over 3,600 judicial opinions would require lengthy review and advocated against Democrats hastening the confirmation process [111] On July 17, McConnell announced that he would vote against Sotomayor's confirmation [112] In August, McConnell called Sotomayor \"a fine person with an impressive story and a distinguished background\" but said he did not believe she would withhold her personal or political views while serving as a justice Sotomayor was confirmed days later [113]\n\n\nUnder Obama\nThroughout Obama's tenure, McConnell led Senate Republicans in what has been called \"a disciplined, sustained, at times underhanded campaign to deny the Democratic president the opportunity to appoint federal judges\" [110] In June 2009, after Obama nominated Sonia Sotomayor as associate justice, McConnell and Jeff Sessions opined that Sotomayor's 17 years as a federal judge and over 3,600 judicial opinions would require lengthy review and advocated against Democrats hastening the confirmation process [111] On July 17, McConnell announced that he would vote against Sotomayor's confirmation [112] In August, McConnell called Sotomayor \"a fine person with an impressive story and a distinguished background\" but said he did not believe she would withhold her personal or political views while serving as a justice Sotomayor was confirmed days later [113]\n\n\nUnder Trump\nIn January 2017, President Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left after Scalia's death [130] Gorsuch's nomination was confirmed on April 7, 2017, after McConnell eliminated the filibuster on Supreme Court nominees [131]\n\n\nGovernment shutdowns\nThe federal government shut down on October 1–17, 2013, after Congress failed to enact legislation to fund it McConnell later vowed Republicans would not force the U.S to default on its debt or shut down the government in 2014, when stopgap funding measures were set to expire He also said he would not allow other Republicans to obstruct the budget-making process [144] [145]\n\n\nShutdown of 2018–2019\nFrom December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019, the federal government shut down when Congress refused to give in to Trump's demand for $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.–Mexico border wall [148] In December 2018, the Republican-controlled Senate unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding, and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Trump appeared likely to approve the bill After Trump faced heavy criticism from some right-wing media outlets and pundits for appearing to back down on his campaign promise to \"build the wall\", he said he would not sign any appropriations bill that did not fund the wall [149]\n\n\nCOVID-19 response\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, McConnell initially opposed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, calling it a Democratic \"ideological wish list\" [158] [159] He reversed his position when Trump endorsed the proposed package [160] The bill passed in the Senate by a vote of 90–8.\n\n\nApproval ratings\nAs the leader of the Senate Republicans, McConnell has received much of the criticism and disapproval that Republicans receive from Democratic voters, receiving near uniform disapproval from left-of-center voters Furthermore, as a result of his unpopularity with Trump and the more populist base, McConnell has had historically low approval for a senator by the electorate as a whole: a 2012 poll and a 2016 poll each found that McConnell had the lowest home-state approval rating of any sitting senator [174] [175] With a 49% disapproval rate in 2017, McConnell had the highest disapproval rating of any senator [176]\n\n\nCommittee assignments\nMcConnell's committee assignments for the 118th Congress are as follows: [181]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nMcConnell has taken conservative stances for the past several decades During his Senate tenure, McConnell led opposition to stricter campaign finance laws, [182] culminating in the Supreme Court ruling that partially overturned the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (McCain-Feingold) in 2010 He led opposition against Obamacare, [183] first through efforts to delay or prevent the law's passage, and later to repeal or replace it, including via the American Healthcare Reform Act McConnell has opposed stronger regulations, gun control measures and efforts to mitigate climate change He has criticized proposed legislation by House Democrats such as the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, [184] and was criticized by Nancy Pelosi for withholding votes on measures passed by the Democratic-controlled House during his time as Senate Majority Leader, including the For the People Act of 2019, the Equality Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act [185] McConnell has supported stronger border security, free trade agreements and reductions in taxes As Senate Majority Leader, he led the passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act in 2018 His foreign policy views have included support of sanctions on Cuba, Iran and Russia, [186] support of Ukraine during its invasion by Russia, [187] opposition to the Iran nuclear deal and support of Israel in its war with Hamas [188] He voted for the Iraq Resolution, which authorized military action against Iraq, [189] and supported the Iraq War troop surge of 2007 in public [190]\n\n\nElectoral history\nIn 1984, McConnell ran for the U.S Senate against two-term Democratic incumbent Walter Dee Huddleston The election race was not decided until the last returns came in, when McConnell won by 3,437 votes out of more than 1.2 million votes cast, just over 0.4% [193] McConnell was the only Republican Senate challenger to win that year, despite Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in the presidential election [194]\n\n\n1984\nIn 1984, McConnell ran for the U.S Senate against two-term Democratic incumbent

the only Republican Senate challenger to win that year, despite Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in the presidential election [194]\n\n\n1990\nIn 1990, McConnell faced former Louisville Mayor Harvey I Sloane, winning by 4.4% [199]\n\n\n1996\nIn 1996, he defeated Steve Beshear by 12.6%, [200] even as Bill Clinton narrowly carried the state McConnell's campaign ran television ads warning voters to

60.2% won by McConnell was the lowest voter support for a Kentucky U.S senator in a primary since 1938 [203] He faced Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes in the general election, and defeated Grimes, 56.2–40.7% [204] [205]\n\n\n2020\nIn the November 2020 general election, McConnell faced Democratic nominee Amy McGrath, a former Marine fighter pilot; and Libertarian nominee Brad Barron, a businessman and farmer [206] [207] During the campaign, McConnell and McGrath agreed to one hour-long, socially distanced debate on October 12 [208] [209] McConnell was elected to his seventh term on November 3 when he defeated McGrath by nearly 20 percentage points [210]\n\n\nPersonal life\nMcConnell is a Southern Baptist, baptized at age 8 [211] He was married to his first wife, Sherrill Redmon, from 1968 to 1980 and had three daughters, Porter, Eleanor (Elly), and Claire [212] [213] [214] Porter McConnell is the campaign director for Take on Wall Street, a left-wing advocacy coalition [215] [216] Following her divorce from McConnell, Redmon became a feminist scholar at Smith College and director of the Sophia Smith Collection [217] [218]\n\n\nFamily\nMcConnell is a

The trophy has undergone several changes since its inception in 1930, with the current design being introduced in 1974. In this article, we will explore the history of the trophy, its design, and the winners of the competition.\n\n**Jules Rimet Trophy**\n\nThe Jules Rimet Cup was the original trophy of the FIFA World Cup. Originally called \"Victory\", but generally known simply as the World Cup or Coupe du Monde, it was renamed in 1946 to honour the FIFA President Jules Rimet, who in 1929 passed a vote to initiate the competition. The trophy was designed by French sculptor Abel Lafleur and made of gold-plated sterling silver on a lapis lazuli base. In 1954, the base was replaced with a taller version to accommodate more winners' details. The Jules Rimet Trophy stood 35 centimeters (14 inches) high and weighed 3.8 kilograms (8.4 pounds).\n\nThe Jules Rimet Trophy comprised a decagonal cup, supported by a winged figure representing Nike, the ancient Greek goddess of victory. The trophy was taken to Uruguay for the first FIFA World Cup aboard the Conte Verde, which set sail from Villefranche-sur-Mer, just southeast of Nice, in June 1930. This was the same ship that carried Jules Rimet and the footballers representing France, Romania, and Belgium who were participating in the tournament that year. The first team to be awarded the trophy was Uruguay, the winners of the 1930 World Cup.\n\n**New Trophy**\n\nA replacement trophy was commissioned by FIFA for the 1974 World Cup. Fifty-three submissions were received from sculptors in seven countries. Italian artist Silvio Gazzaniga was awarded the commission. The trophy stands 36.5 centimeters (14.4 inches) tall and is made of 6.175 kilograms (13.61 pounds) of 18-karat (75%) gold, worth approximately US$161,000 in 2018. Its base is 13 centimeters (5.1 inches) in diameter containing two layers of malachite.\n\nChemist Sir Martyn Poliakoff claims that the trophy is hollow, because if it were solid gold, the trophy would weigh 70–80 kilograms (150–180 pounds) and would be too heavy to lift. The trophy's original manufacturer also confirmed its hollowness.\n\n**Winners**\n\nThe FIFA World Cup Trophy has been won by 22 different national teams since its inception in 1930. The most successful team in the history of the competition is Brazil, with five titles. Germany and Italy have also won the trophy four times each, while Argentina, Uruguay, and France have won it twice. The United States and England have each won the trophy once, while the Soviet Union won the trophy in 1960.\n\nHere is a historic list of all holders of the trophy (winners of the FIFA World Cup):\n\n1. 1930: Uruguay\n2. 1934: Italy\n3. 1938: Italy\n4. 1950: Uruguay\n5. 1954: West Germany\n6. 1958: Brazil\n7. 1962: Brazil\n8. 1966: England\n9. 1970: Brazil\n10. 1974: West Germany\n11. 1978: Argentina\n12. 1982: Italy\n13. 1986: Argentina\n14. 1990: West Germany\n15. 1994: Brazil\n16. 1998: France\n17. 2002: Brazil\n18. 2006: Italy\n19. 2010: Spain\n20. 2014: Germany\n21. 2018: France\n22. 2022: Argentina\n\n**References**\n\nNote: This article does not include any references or citations.\n\n**External Links**\n\nFor more information on the FIFA World Cup Trophy, please visit the official FIFA website.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"FIFA_World_Cup_Trophy\" following this outline:\n\n\nJules Rimet Trophy\nThe Jules Rimet Cup was the original trophy of the FIFA World Cup Originally called \"Victory\", but generally known simply as the World Cup or Coupe du Monde, it was renamed in 1946 to honour the FIFA President Jules Rimet, who in 1929 passed a vote to initiate the competition It was designed by French sculptor Abel Lafleur and made of gold-plated sterling silver on a lapis lazuli base [5] In 1954 the base was replaced with a taller version to accommodate more winners' details It stood 35 centimetres (14 in) high and weighed 3.8 kilograms (8.4 lb) [6]\nIt comprised a decagonal cup, supported by a winged figure representing Nike, the ancient Greek goddess of victory The Jules Rimet Trophy was taken to Uruguay for the first FIFA World Cup aboard the Conte Verde, which set sail from Villefranche-sur-Mer, just southeast of Nice, in June 1930 This was the same ship that carried Jules Rimet and the footballers representing France, Romania, and Belgium who were participating in the tournament that year The first team to be awarded the trophy was Uruguay, the winners of the 1930 World Cup [7]\n\n\nNew trophy\nA replacement trophy was commissioned by FIFA for the 1974 World Cup Fifty-three submissions were received from sculptors in seven countries [19] [21] Italian artist Silvio Gazzaniga was awarded the commission The trophy stands 36.5 centimetres (14.4 in) tall and is made of 6.175 kilograms (13.61 lb) of 18 karat (75%) gold, worth approximately US$161,000 in 2018 Its base is 13 centimetres (5.1 in) in diameter containing two layers of malachite Chemist Sir Martyn Poliakoff claims that the trophy is hollow, because if it were solid gold, the trophy would weigh 70–80 kilograms (150–180 lb) and would be too heavy to lift; [22] [23] the trophy's original manufacturer also confirmed its hollowness [24] [25]\n\n\nWinners\nHistoric list of all holders of the trophy (winners of the FIFA World Cup).\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

possible mistakes at some point\" [9]\n\n\nMember of the Bundestag, 1998–2001\nScholz was elected to his first political office as a Deputy Member of the Bundestag representing the constituency of Hamburg-Altona in 1998, aged 40 [13] During his tenure, Scholz served on the Committee for Labor and Social Matters In the committee of inquiry into the visa affair of the Bundestag, he was chairman of the SPD parliamentary group [14] Scholz resigned his mandate on 6 June 2001, to take office as Senator [clarification needed] Because his seat was an overhang seat, it was not filled until the 2002 German federal election [citation needed]\n\n\nSenator for the Interior of Hamburg, 2001\nOn 30 May 2001, Scholz succeeded Hartmuth Wrocklage to become Senator for the Interior of Hamburg in the Senate led by Mayor Ortwin Runde Wrocklage had resigned due to allegations of nepotism He also succeeded Wrocklage as Deputy Member of the Bundesrat [citation needed]\n\n\nFederal and state political career\nScholz was elected again to the Bundestag in the 2002 German federal election From 2002 to 2004, Scholz also served as General Secretary of the SPD; he resigned from that office when party leader and Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, facing disaffection within his own party and hampered by persistently low public approval ratings, announced he would step down as Leader of the Social Democratic Party [19]\n\n\nMember of the Bundestag, 2002–2011\nScholz was elected again to the Bundestag in the 2002 German federal election From 2002 to 2004, Scholz also served as General Secretary of the SPD; he resigned from that office when party leader and Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, facing disaffection within his own party and hampered by persistently low public approval ratings, announced he would step down as Leader of the Social Democratic Party [19]\n\n\nMinister of Labour and Social Affairs, 2007–2009\nIn 2007, Scholz was appointed to serve as Minister of Labour and Social Affairs in the first Merkel Government, succeeding Franz Müntefering [26] [27]\n\n\nFirst Mayor of Hamburg, 2011–2018\nIn 2011, Scholz was the lead SPD candidate at the Hamburg state election, which the SPD won with 48.3% of the votes, taking 62 of 121 seats in the Hamburg Parliament [30] Scholz resigned as a Member of the Bundestag on 11 March 2011, days after his formal election as First Mayor of Hamburg; Dorothee Stapelfeldt, also a Social Democrat, was appointed his Deputy First Mayor [31] [32] [33]\n\n\nVice Chancellor and Minister of Finance, 2018–2021\nAfter a lengthy period of

alongside the rest of the fourth Merkel cabinet on 14 March 2018, also taking the role of Vice Chancellor of Germany under Angela Merkel [50] Within his first months in office, Scholz became one of Germany's most popular politicians, reaching an approval rating of 50% [51]\n\n\nPolitical views in the 2010s\nWithin the SPD, Scholz is widely viewed as forming part of the moderate wing of the party [7] Because of his flat enunciation and mechanical-sounding choice of words in press conferences and interviews, Scholz has been nicknamed \"the Scholzomat\" by some media outlets In 2013, he said that he found the nickname \"very appropriate\" [66] [67] In January 2019, Scholz stated that he sees China primarily as an economic partner [68] He tried to persuade Chinese Vice Premier Liu He that China should be more open to German firms, [69] and he supported the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment between the EU and China [70] In September 2022, he condemned the treatment of ethnic Uyghurs in China's Xinjiang [71]\n\n\nEconomic and financial policy\nScholz has been campaigning for a financial transaction tax for several years Experts have criticized parts of this plan, arguing that it would disproportionately affect small shareholders [73] [74] [75] [76] In December 2019, Scholz pushed for the introduction of this tax at European Union level According to a draft legislation, share purchases should be taxed when they involve shares in companies with a market capitalization over €1B [77] Journalist Hermann-Josef Tenhagen criticized this version of the transaction tax on the basis that it would disproportionately affect lower-income individuals [78] A report by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy commissioned by the Federal Government in 2020 certified the same deficiencies in the tax concept that Tenhagen had already pointed out [79]\n\n\nEnvironment and climate policy\nIn September 2019, Scholz negotiated the climate package in a key role for the SPD To this he said: \"What we have presented is a great achievement\", whereas climate scientists almost unanimously criticized the result as insufficient [81] [82] [83] [84] [85]\n\n\nRelationship with the United States\nIn December 2019, Scholz criticized US sanctions on Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany, saying: \"Such sanctions are a serious interference in the internal affairs of Germany and Europe and their sovereignty.\" [96]\n\n\nCandidate for party co-leadership, 2019\nIn June 2019, Scholz initially ruled out a candidacy for the party co-leadership following the resignation of Andrea Nahles He explained that a simultaneous activity as Federal Minister of Finance and party leader was \"not possible in terms of time\" [99] [100] [101] However, in August, Scholz announced his intention to run for party chairmanship with Klara Geywitz [102] [103] He said that many of his preferred candidates had not run for office, expressing a sense of \"responsibility\" [104] Of the six candidate duos standing for election, the Geywitz-Scholz due received the most votes in the first round of the membership elections on 26 October 2019, with 22.7% They qualified for the runoff election with the second-placed team Saskia Esken and Norbert Walter-Borjans, which had received 21.0% of the vote [105]\n\n\nChancellor candidate, 2021\nOn 10 August 2020, SPD party leadership agreed that it would nominate Scholz to be the party's candidate for Chancellor of Germany at the 2021 federal election [107] Scholz is usually grouped with the moderate wing of the SPD, [108] and his nomination was seen by Die Tageszeitung as marking a decline of the party's left [109]\n\n\nChancellor of Germany (2021–present)\nScholz was elected chancellor by the Bundestag on 8 December 2021, with 395 votes in favour and 303 against [113] His new government was appointed on the same day by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier [114] At 63 years, 177 days of age, Scholz is the

2021 election, Scholz opposed a COVID-19 vaccine mandate Since late November 2021, he has expressed support for mandatory vaccination for adults, scheduled to be voted during the first months of 2022 by the federal parliament, and for the closure of non-essential retail stores to unvaccinated adults, based on the 2G-Regel, decreed by state governments in December 2021 [154] [155] [156] [157] [158]\n\n\nRelationship with Poland\nIn December 2021, Scholz rejected the Polish government's claim for further World War II reparations [162] As a consequence of Nazi German aggression in World War II, Poland lost about a fifth of its population and much of its industry and infrastructure was destroyed As a compensation Poland was awarded large parts of eastern Germany at the Potsdam Conference in 1945, [163] [164] with Germany finally renouncing its claims to these territories – including East Prussia, most of Silesia, as well as the eastern parts of Brandenburg and Pomerania – in the Two Plus Four Agreement in 1990 According to the German government, there is no legal basis for further compensation payments [165] In a meeting with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, Scholz said \"We have concluded treaties that are valid and have settled the past issues and the compensation\" [165] Scholz also pointed out that Germany \"continues to be willing to pay very, very high contributions to the EU budget\", from which Poland has benefited considerably since its accession to the EU [165]\n\n\nRussian invasion of Ukraine\nIn January 2022, The New York Times reported intensifying concerns from the US and other NATO allies about the Scholz government's \"evident hesitation to take forceful measures\" against Russia in the 2021–2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis [166]\n\n\nImmigration policy\nIn December 2021, Scholz said that Germany was a country of immigration and pledged to reduce barriers to immigration to Germany and make it easier for immigrants to obtain German citizenship [195] 352,000 people applied for asylum in Germany in 2023, the highest number since 2016, when 722,370 people applied for asylum People from Ukraine are not included among asylum seekers Most asylum seekers in 2023 were from Turkey, Syria and Afghanistan [196] In September 2023, more than 120 boats carrying approximately 7,000 migrants from Africa arrived on the island of Lampedusa within 24 hours [197] Some of the migrants were relocated to Germany [198]\n\n\nOther activities\nOlaf Scholz is married to fellow SPD politician Britta Ernst The couple lived in

He argued that there is no legal basis for further compensation payments and that Germany has already concluded treaties that are valid and have settled the past issues and the compensation.\n\n**Russian Invasion of Ukraine**\n\nIn January 2022, The New York Times reported intensifying concerns from the US and other NATO allies about the Scholz government's \"evident hesitation to take forceful measures\" against Russia in the 2021-2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis.\n\n**Immigration Policy**\n\nIn December 2021, Scholz said that Germany is a country of immigration and pledged to reduce barriers to immigration to Germany and make it easier for immigrants to obtain German citizenship. In 2023, 352,000 people applied for asylum in Germany, the highest number since 2016.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nScholz is married to fellow SPD politician Britta Ernst.

1998–2001\nScholz was elected to his first political office as a Deputy Member of the Bundestag representing the constituency of Hamburg-Altona in 1998, aged 40 [13] During his tenure, Scholz served on the Committee for Labor and Social Matters In the committee of inquiry into the visa affair of the Bundestag, he was chairman of the SPD parliamentary group [14] Scholz resigned his mandate on 6 June 2001, to take office as Senator [clarification needed] Because his seat was an overhang seat, it was not filled until the 2002 German federal election [citation needed]\n\n\nSenator for the Interior of Hamburg, 2001\nOn 30 May 2001, Scholz succeeded Hartmuth Wrocklage to become Senator for the Interior of Hamburg in the Senate led by Mayor Ortwin Runde Wrocklage had resigned due to allegations of nepotism He also succeeded Wrocklage as Deputy Member of the Bundesrat [citation needed]\n\n\nFederal and state political career\nScholz was elected again to the Bundestag in the 2002 German federal election From 2002 to 2004, Scholz also served as General Secretary of the SPD; he resigned from that office when party leader and Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, facing disaffection within his own party and hampered by persistently low public approval ratings, announced he would step down as Leader of the Social Democratic Party [19]\n\n\nMember of the Bundestag, 2002–2011\nScholz was elected again to the Bundestag in the 2002 German federal election From 2002 to 2004, Scholz also served as General Secretary of the SPD; he resigned from that office when party leader and Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, facing disaffection within his own party and hampered by persistently low public approval ratings, announced he would step down as Leader of the Social Democratic Party [19]\n\n\nMinister of Labour and Social Affairs, 2007–2009\nIn 2007, Scholz was appointed to serve as Minister of Labour and Social Affairs in the first Merkel Government, succeeding Franz Müntefering [26] [27]\n\n\nFirst Mayor of Hamburg, 2011–2018\nIn 2011, Scholz was the lead SPD candidate at the Hamburg state election, which the SPD won with 48.3% of the votes, taking 62 of 121 seats in the Hamburg Parliament [30] Scholz resigned as a Member of the Bundestag on 11 March 2011, days after his formal election as First Mayor of Hamburg; Dorothee Stapelfeldt, also a Social Democrat, was appointed his Deputy First Mayor [31] [32] [33]\n\n\nVice Chancellor and Minister of Finance, 2018–2021\nAfter a lengthy period of inter-party negotiations following the 2017 federal election, during which the CDU, CSU and SPD agreed to continue in coalition, Scholz was appointed Federal Minister of Finance Scholz was sworn in alongside the rest of the fourth Merkel cabinet on 14 March 2018, also taking the role of Vice Chancellor of Germany under Angela Merkel [50] Within his first months in office, Scholz became one of Germany's most popular politicians, reaching an approval rating of 50% [51]\n\n\nPolitical views in the 2010s\nWithin the SPD, Scholz is widely viewed as forming part of the moderate wing of the party [7] Because of his flat enunciation and mechanical-sounding choice of words in press conferences and interviews, Scholz has been nicknamed \"the Scholzomat\" by some media outlets In 2013, he said that he found the nickname \"very appropriate\" [66] [67] In January 2019, Scholz stated that he sees China primarily as an economic partner [68] He tried to persuade Chinese Vice Premier Liu He that China should be more open to German firms, [69] and he supported the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment between the EU and China [70] In September 2022, he condemned the treatment of ethnic Uyghurs in China's Xinjiang [71]\n\n\nEconomic and financial policy\nScholz has been campaigning for a financial transaction tax for several years Experts have criticized parts of this plan, arguing that it would disproportionately affect small shareholders [73] [74] [75] [76] In December 2019, Scholz pushed for the introduction of this tax at European Union level According to a draft legislation, share purchases should be taxed when they involve shares in companies with a market capitalization over €1B [77] Journalist Hermann-Josef Tenhagen criticized this version of the transaction tax on the basis that it would disproportionately affect lower-income individuals [78] A report by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy commissioned by the Federal Government in 2020 certified the same deficiencies in the tax concept that Tenhagen had already pointed out [79]\n\n\nEnvironment and climate policy\nIn September 2019, Scholz negotiated the climate package in a key role for the SPD To this he said: \"What we have presented is a great achievement\", whereas climate scientists almost unanimously criticized the result as insufficient [81] [82] [83] [84] [85]\n\n\nRelationship with the United States\nIn December 2019, Scholz criticized US sanctions on Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany, saying: \"Such sanctions are a serious interference in the internal affairs of Germany and Europe and their sovereignty.\" [96]\n\n\nCandidate for party co-leadership, 2019\nIn June 2019, Scholz initially ruled out a candidacy for the party co-leadership following the resignation of Andrea Nahles He explained that a simultaneous activity as Federal Minister of Finance and party leader was \"not possible in terms of time\" [99] [100] [101] However, in August, Scholz announced his intention to run for party chairmanship with Klara Geywitz [102] [103] He said that many of his preferred candidates had not run for office, expressing a sense of \"responsibility\" [104] Of the six candidate duos standing for election, the Geywitz-Scholz due received the most votes in the first round of the membership elections on 26 October 2019, with 22.7% They qualified for the runoff election with the second-placed team Saskia Esken and Norbert Walter-Borjans, which had received 21.0% of the vote [105]\n\n\nChancellor candidate, 2021\nOn 10 August 2020, SPD party leadership agreed that it would nominate Scholz to be the party's candidate for Chancellor of Germany at the 2021 federal election [107] Scholz is usually grouped with the moderate wing of the SPD, [108] and his nomination was seen by Die Tageszeitung as marking a decline of the party's left [109]\n\n\nChancellor of Germany (2021–present)\nScholz was elected chancellor by the Bundestag on 8 December 2021, with 395 votes in favour and 303 against [113] His new government was appointed on the same day by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier [114] At 63 years, 177 days of age, Scholz is the oldest person to become Chancellor of Germany since Ludwig Erhard, who was 66 years, 255 days old when he assumed office on 17 October 1963.\n\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine mandate\nDuring his campaign in the 2021 election, Scholz opposed a COVID-19 vaccine mandate Since late November 2021, he has expressed support for mandatory vaccination for adults, scheduled to be voted during the first months of 2022 by the federal parliament, and for the closure of non-essential retail stores to unvaccinated adults, based on the 2G-Regel, decreed by state governments in December 2021 [154] [155] [156] [157] [158]\n\n\nRelationship with Poland\nIn December 2021, Scholz rejected the Polish government's claim for further World War II reparations [162] As a consequence of Nazi German aggression in World War II, Poland lost about a fifth of its population and much of its industry and infrastructure was destroyed As a compensation Poland was awarded large parts of eastern Germany at the Potsdam Conference in 1945, [163] [164] with Germany finally renouncing its claims to these territories – including East Prussia, most of Silesia, as well as the eastern parts of Brandenburg and Pomerania – in the Two Plus Four Agreement in 1990 According to the German government, there is no legal basis for further compensation payments [165] In a meeting with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, Scholz said \"We have concluded treaties that are valid and have settled the past issues and the compensation\" [165] Scholz also pointed out that Germany \"continues to be willing to pay very, very high contributions to the EU budget\", from which Poland has benefited considerably since its accession to the EU [165]\n\n\nRussian invasion of Ukraine\nIn January 2022, The New York Times reported intensifying concerns from the US and other NATO allies about the Scholz government's \"evident hesitation to take forceful measures\" against Russia in the 2021–2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis [166]\n\n\nImmigration policy\nIn December 2021, Scholz said that Germany was a country of immigration and pledged to reduce barriers to immigration to Germany and make it easier for immigrants to obtain German citizenship [195] 352,000 people applied for asylum in Germany in 2023, the highest number since 2016, when 722,370 people applied for asylum People from Ukraine are not included among asylum seekers Most asylum seekers in 2023 were from Turkey, Syria and Afghanistan [196] In September 2023, more than 120 boats carrying approximately 7,000 migrants from Africa arrived on the island of Lampedusa within 24 hours [197] Some of the migrants were relocated to Germany [198]\n\n\nOther activities\nOlaf Scholz is married to fellow SPD politician Britta Ernst The couple lived in

{"title": "Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "content": "\nHistory\nIt was while debating the separation of powers between the legislative and executive departments that delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention established the parameters for the national judiciary [6] Creating a \"third branch\" of government was a novel idea [citation needed]; in the English tradition, judicial matters had been treated as an aspect of royal (executive) authority Early on, the delegates who were opposed to having a strong central government argued that national laws could be enforced by state courts, while others, including James Madison, advocated for a national judicial authority consisting of tribunals chosen by the national legislature It was proposed that the judiciary should have a role in checking the executive's power to veto or revise laws [citation needed]\n\n\nEarly beginnings\nUnder chief justices Jay, Rutledge, and Ellsworth (1789–1801), the court heard few cases; its first decision was West v Barnes (1791), a case involving procedure [14] As the court initially had only six members, every decision that it made by a majority was also made by two-thirds (voting four to two) [15] However, Congress has always allowed less than the court's full membership to make decisions, starting with a quorum of four justices in 1789 [16] The court lacked a home of its own and had little prestige, [17] a situation not helped by the era's highest-profile case, Chisholm v Georgia (1793), which was reversed within two years by the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment [18]\n\n\nFrom Taney to Taft\nThe Taney Court (1836–1864) made several important rulings, such as Sheldon v Sill, which held that while Congress may not limit the subjects the Supreme Court may hear, it may limit the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts to prevent them from hearing cases dealing with certain subjects [31] Nevertheless, it is primarily remembered for its ruling in Dred Scott v Sandford, [32] which helped precipitate the American Civil War [33] In the Reconstruction era, the Chase, Waite, and Fuller Courts (1864–1910) interpreted the new Civil War amendments to the Constitution [26] and developed the doctrine of substantive due process (Lochner v New York; [34] Adair v United States) [35] The size of the court was last changed in 1869, when it was set at nine.\n\n\nNew Deal era\nDuring the Hughes, Stone, and Vinson courts (1930–1953), the court gained its own accommodation in 1935 [39] and changed its interpretation of the Constitution, giving a broader reading to the powers of the federal government to facilitate President Franklin D Roosevelt's New Deal (most prominently West Coast Hotel Co v Parrish, Wickard v Filburn, United States v Darby, and United States v Butler) [40] [41] [42] During World War II, the court continued to favor government power, upholding the internment of Japanese Americans (Korematsu v United States) and the mandatory Pledge of Allegiance (Minersville School District v Gobitis) Nevertheless, Gobitis was soon repudiated (West Virginia State Board of Education v Barnette), and the Steel Seizure Case restricted the pro-government trend.\n\n\nBurger, Rehnquist, and Roberts\nThe Burger Court (1969–1986) saw a conservative shift [52] It also expanded Griswold's right to privacy to strike down abortion laws (Roe v Wade) [53] but divided deeply on affirmative action (Regents of the University of California v Bakke) [54] and campaign finance regulation (Buckley v Valeo) [55] It also wavered on the death penalty, ruling first that most applications were defective (Furman v Georgia), [56] but later that the death penalty itself was not unconstitutional (Gregg v Georgia) [56] [57] [58]\n\n\nComposition\nArticle II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution, known as the Appointments Clause, empowers the president to nominate and, with the confirmation (advice and consent) of the United States Senate, to appoint public officials, including justices of the Supreme Court This clause is one example of the system of checks and balances inherent in the Constitution The president has the plenary power to nominate, while the Senate possesses the plenary power to reject or confirm the nominee The Constitution sets no qualifications for service as a justice, such as age, citizenship, residence or prior judicial experience, thus a president may nominate anyone to serve, and the Senate may not set any qualifications or otherwise limit who the president can choose [80] [81] [82]\n\n\nNomination, confirmation, and appointment\nArticle II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution, known as the Appointments Clause, empowers the president to nominate and, with the confirmation (advice and consent) of the United States Senate, to appoint public officials, including justices of the Supreme Court This clause is one example of the system of checks and balances inherent in the Constitution The president has the plenary power to nominate, while the Senate possesses the plenary power to reject or confirm the nominee The Constitution sets no qualifications for service as a justice, such as age, citizenship, residence or prior judicial experience, thus a president may nominate anyone to serve, and the Senate may not set any qualifications or otherwise limit who the president can choose [80] [81] [82]\n\n\nRecess appointments\nWhen the Senate is in recess, a president may make temporary appointments to fill vacancies Recess appointees hold office only until the end of the next Senate session (less than two years) The Senate must confirm the nominee for them to continue serving; of the two chief justices and eleven associate justices who have received recess appointments, only Chief Justice John Rutledge was not subsequently confirmed [94]\n\n\nTenure\n\nLifetime tenure of justices can only be found for US federal judges and the State of Rhode Island's Supreme Court justices, with all other democratic nations and all other US states having set term limits or mandatory retirement ages [100] Larry Sabato wrote: \"The insularity of lifetime tenure, combined with the appointments of relatively young attorneys who give long service on the bench, produces senior judges representing the views of past generations better than views of the current day.\" [101] Sanford Levinson has been critical of justices who stayed in office despite medical deterioration based on longevity [102] James MacGregor Burns stated lifelong tenure has \"produced a critical time lag, with the Supreme Court institutionally almost always behind the times.\" [103] Proposals to solve these problems include term limits for justices, as proposed by Levinson [104] and Sabato [101] [105] and a mandatory retirement age proposed by Richard Epstein, [106] among others [107] Alexander Hamilton in Federalist 78 argued that one benefit of lifetime tenure was that, \"nothing can contribute so much to its firmness and independence as permanency in office.\" [108] [non-primary source needed]\n\nSize of the court\nOne of the smallest supreme courts in the world, the U.S Supreme Court consists of nine members: one chief justice and eight associate justices The U.S Constitution does not specify the size of the Supreme Court, nor does it specify any specific positions for the court's members The Constitution assumes the existence of the office of the chief justice, because it mentions in Article I, Section 3, Clause 6 that \"the Chief Justice\" must preside over impeachment trials of the President of the United States The power to define the Supreme Court's size and membership has been assumed to belong to Congress, which initially established a six-member Supreme Court composed of a chief justice and five associate justices through the Judiciary Act of 1789.\n\n\nMembership\nThere are currently nine justices on the Supreme Court: Chief Justice John Roberts and eight associate justices Among the current members of the court, Clarence Thomas is the longest-serving justice, with a tenure of 12,081 days (33 years, 27 days) as of November 19, 2024; the most recent justice to join the court is Ketanji Brown Jackson, whose tenure began on June 30, 2022, after being confirmed by the Senate on April 7 [134]\n\n\nCurrent justices\nThere are currently nine justices on the Supreme Court: Chief Justice John Roberts and eight associate justices Among the current members of the court, Clarence Thomas is the longest-serving justice, with a tenure of 12,081 days (33 years, 27 days) as of November 19, 2024; the most recent justice to join the court is Ketanji Brown Jackson, whose tenure began on June 30, 2022, after being confirmed by the Senate on April 7 [134]\n\n\nCourt demographics\nThe court currently has five male and four female justices Among the nine justices, there are two African American justices (Justices Thomas and Jackson) and one Hispanic justice (Justice Sotomayor) One of the justices was born to at least one immigrant parent: Justice Alito's father was born in Italy [137] [138]\n\n\nJudicial leanings\nJustices are nominated by the president in power, and receive confirmation by the Senate, historically holding many of the views of the nominating president's political party While justices do not represent or receive official endorsements from political parties, as is accepted practice in the legislative and executive branches, organizations such as the Federalist Society do officially filter and endorse judges that have a sufficiently conservative view of the law Jurists are often informally categorized in the media as being conservatives or liberal Attempts to quantify the ideologies of jurists include the Segal–Cover score, Martin-Quinn score, and Judicial Common Space score [152] [153]\n\n\nRetired justices\nThere are currently three living retired justices of the Supreme Court of the United States: Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, and Stephen Breyer As retired justices, they no longer participate in the work of the Supreme Court, but may be designated for temporary assignments to sit on lower federal courts, usually the United States Courts of Appeals Such assignments are formally made by the chief justice, on request of the chief judge of the lower court and with the consent of the retired justice In recent years, Justice Souter has frequently sat on the First Circuit, the court of which he was briefly a member before joining the Supreme Court [164] The status of a retired justice is analogous to that of a circuit or district court judge who has taken senior status, and eligibility of a Supreme Court justice to assume retired status (rather than simply resign from the bench) is governed by the same age and service criteria.\n\n\nSalary\nAs of 2024, associate justices receive a yearly salary of $298,500 and the chief justice is paid $312,200 per year [169] Once a justice meets age and service requirements, the justice may retire with a pension based on the same formula used for federal employees As with other federal courts judges, their pension can never be less than their salary at the time of retirement according to the Compensation Clause of Article III of the Constitution [citation needed]\n\n\nSeniority and seating\nFor the most part, the day-to-day activities of the justices are governed by rules of protocol based upon the seniority of justices The chief justice always ranks first in the order of precedence—regardless of the length of their service [170] The associate justices are then ranked by the length of their service The chief justice sits in the center on the bench, or at the head of the table during conferences The other justices are seated in order of seniority The senior-most associate justice sits immediately to the chief justice's right; the second most senior sits immediately to their left The seats alternate right to left in order of seniority, with the most junior justice occupying the last seat [171] Therefore, since the October 2022 term, the court sits as follows from left to right, from the perspective of those facing the court: Barrett, Gorsuch, Sotomayor, Thomas (most senior associate justice), Roberts (chief justice), Alito, Kagan, Kavanaugh, and Jackson Likewise, when the members of the court gather for official group photographs, justices are arranged in order of seniority, with the five most senior members seated in the front row in the same order as they would sit during Court sessions (currently, from left to right, Sotomayor, Thomas, Roberts, Alito, and Kagan), and the four most junior justices standing behind them, again in the same order as they would sit during Court sessions (Barrett, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Jackson).\n\n\nFacilities\nThe Supreme Court first met on February 1, 1790, at the Merchants' Exchange Building in New York City When Philadelphia became the capital, the court met briefly in Independence Hall before settling in Old City Hall from 1791 until 1800 After the government moved to Washington, D.C., the court occupied various spaces in the Capitol building until 1935, when it moved into its own purpose-built home The four-story building was designed by Cass Gilbert in a classical style sympathetic to the surrounding buildings of the Capitol and Library of Congress, and is clad in marble The building includes the courtroom, justices' chambers, an extensive law library, various meeting spaces, and auxiliary services including a gymnasium The Supreme Court building is within the ambit of the Architect of the Capitol, but maintains its own Supreme Court Police, separate from the Capitol Police [173]\n\n\nJurisdiction\nCongress is authorized by Article III of the federal Constitution to regulate the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction.\n\n\nOriginal jurisdiction\nThe Supreme Court has original and exclusive jurisdiction over cases between two or more states [178] but may decline to hear such cases [179] It also possesses original but not exclusive jurisdiction to hear \"all actions or proceedings to which ambassadors, other public ministers, consuls, or vice consuls of foreign states are parties; all controversies between the United States and a State; and all actions or proceedings by a State against the citizens of another State or against aliens.\" [180]\n\n\nAppellate jurisdiction\nThe court's appellate jurisdiction consists of appeals from federal courts of appeal (through certiorari, certiorari before judgment, and certified questions), [186] the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (through certiorari), [187] the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico (through certiorari), [188] the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands (through certiorari), [189] the District of Columbia Court of Appeals (through certiorari), [190] and \"final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had\" (through certiorari) [190] In the last case, an appeal may be made to the Supreme Court from a lower state court if the state's highest court declined to hear an appeal or lacks jurisdiction to hear an appeal For example, a decision rendered by one of the Florida District Courts of Appeal can be appealed to the U.S Supreme Court if (a) the Supreme Court of Florida declined to grant certiorari, e.g Florida Star v B J F., or (b) the district court of appeal issued a per curiam decision simply affirming the lower court's decision without discussing the merits of the case, since the Supreme Court of Florida lacks jurisdiction to hear appeals of such decisions [191] The power of the Supreme Court to consider appeals from state courts, rather than just federal courts, was created by the Judiciary Act of 1789 and upheld early in the court's history, by its rulings in Martin v Hunter's Lessee (1816) and Cohens v Virginia (1821) The Supreme Court is the only federal court that has jurisdiction over direct appeals from state court decisions, although there are several devices that permit so-called \"collateral review\" of state cases This \"collateral review\" often only applies to individuals on death row and not through the regular judicial system [192]\n\n\nJustices as circuit justices\nThe United States is divided into thirteen circuit courts of appeals, each of which is assigned a \"circuit justice\" from the Supreme Court Although this concept has been in continuous existence throughout the history of the republic, its meaning has changed through time Under the Judiciary Act of 1789, each justice was required to \"ride circuit\", or to travel within the assigned circuit and consider cases alongside local judges This practice encountered opposition from many justices, who cited the difficulty of travel Moreover, there was a potential for a conflict of interest on the court if a justice had previously decided the same case while riding circuit Circuit riding ended in 1901, when the Circuit Court of Appeals Act was passed, and circuit riding was officially abolished by Congress in 1911 [194]\n\n\nProcess\nNearly all cases come before the court by way of petitions for writs of certiorari, commonly referred to as cert, upon which the court grants a writ of certiorari The court may review via this process any civil or criminal case in the federal courts of appeals [200] It may also review by certiorari a final judgment of the highest court of a state if the judgment involves a question of federal statutory or constitutional law [201] A case may alternatively come before the court as a direct appeal from a three-judge federal district court [202] The party that petitions the court for review is the petitioner and the non-mover is the respondent.\n\n\nCase selection\nNearly all cases come before the court by way of petitions for writs of certiorari, commonly referred to as cert, upon which the court grants a writ of certiorari The court may review via this process any civil or criminal case in the federal courts of appeals [200] It may also review by certiorari a final judgment of the highest court of a state if the judgment involves a question of federal statutory or constitutional law [201] A case may alternatively come before the court as a direct appeal from a three-judge federal district court [202] The party that petitions the court for review is the petitioner and the non-mover is the respondent.\n\n\nWritten evidence\nThe Court also relies on and cites amicus briefs, law review articles, and other written works for their decisions While law review article use has increased slightly with one article cited per decision on average, [210] the use of amicus briefs has increased significantly [211] The use of amicus briefs has received criticism, including the ability of authors to discuss topics outside their expertise (unlike in lower courts), [211] with documented examples of falsehoods in written opinions, often supplied to the justices by amicus briefs from groups advocating a particular outcome [212] The lack of funding transparency and the lack of a requirement to submit them earlier in the process also make it more difficult to fact-check and understand the credibility of amicus briefs [211]\n\n\nOral argument\nWhen the court grants a cert petition, the case is set for oral argument Both parties will file briefs on the merits of the case, as distinct from the reasons they may have argued for granting or denying the cert petition With the consent of the parties or approval of the court, amici curiae, or \"friends of the court\", may also file briefs The court holds two-week oral argument sessions each month from October through April Each side has thirty minutes to present its argument (the court may choose to give more time, although this is rare), [213] and during that time, the justices may interrupt the advocate and ask questions In 2019, the court adopted a rule generally allowing advocates to speak uninterrupted for the first two minutes of their argument [214] The petitioner gives the first presentation, and may reserve some time to rebut the respondent's arguments after the respondent has concluded Amici curiae may also present oral argument on behalf of one party if that party agrees The court advises counsel to assume that the justices are familiar with and have read the briefs filed in a case.\n\n\nDecision\nAt the conclusion of oral argument, the case is submitted for decision Cases are decided by majority vote of the justices After the oral argument is concluded, usually in the same week as the case was submitted, the justices retire to another conference at which the preliminary votes are tallied and the court sees which side has prevailed One of the justices in the majority is then assigned to write the court's opinion, also known as the \"majority opinion\", an assignment made by the most senior justice in the majority, with the chief justice always being considered the most senior Drafts of the court's opinion circulate among the justices until the court is prepared to announce the judgment in a particular case [215]\n\n\nPublished opinions\nThe court's opinions are published in three stages First, a slip opinion is made available on the court's web site and through other outlets Next, several opinions and lists of the court's orders are bound together in paperback form, called a preliminary print of United States Reports, the official series of books in which the final version of the court's opinions appears About a year after the preliminary prints are issued, a final bound volume of U.S Reports is issued by the Reporter of Decisions The individual volumes of U.S Reports are numbered so that users may cite this set of reports (or a competing version published by another commercial legal publisher but containing parallel citations) to allow those who read their pleadings and other briefs to find the cases quickly and easily As of January 2019 [update], there are:\n\n\nCitations to published opinions\nLawyers use an abbreviated format to cite cases, in the form \"vol U.S page, pin (year)\", where vol is the volume number, page is the page number on which the opinion begins, and year is the year in which the case was decided Optionally, pin is used to \"pinpoint\" to a specific page number within the opinion For instance, the citation for Roe v Wade is 410 U.S 113 (1973), which means the case was decided in 1973 and appears on page 113 of volume 410 of U.S Reports For opinions or orders that have not yet been published in the preliminary print, the volume and page numbers may be replaced with ___\n\n\nSupreme Court bar\nIn order to plead before the court, an attorney must first be admitted to the court's bar Approximately 4,000 lawyers join the bar each year The bar contains an estimated 230,000 members In reality, pleading is limited to several hundred attorneys [citation needed] The rest join for a one-time fee of $200, with the court collecting about $750,000 annually Attorneys can be admitted as either individuals or as groups The group admission is held before the current justices of the Supreme Court, wherein the chief justice approves a motion to admit the new attorneys [226] Lawyers commonly apply for the cosmetic value of a certificate to display in their office or on their resume They also receive access to better seating if they wish to attend an oral argument [227] Members of the Supreme Court Bar are also granted access to the collections of the Supreme Court Library [228]\n\n\nTerm\nA term of the Supreme Court commences on the first Monday of each October, and continues until June or early July of the following year Each term consists of alternating periods of around two weeks known as \"sittings\" and \"recesses\"; justices hear cases and deliver rulings during sittings, and discuss cases and write opinions during recesses [229]\n\n\nInstitutional powers\nThe federal court system and the judicial authority to interpret the Constitution received little attention in the debates over the drafting and ratification of the Constitution The power of judicial review, in fact, is nowhere mentioned in it Over the ensuing years, the question of whether the power of judicial review was even intended by the drafters of the Constitution was quickly frustrated by the lack of evidence bearing on the question either way [230] Nevertheless, the power of judiciary to overturn laws and executive actions it determines are unlawful or unconstitutional is a well-established precedent Many of the Founding Fathers accepted the notion of judicial review; in Federalist No 78, Alexander Hamilton wrote: \"A Constitution is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, and the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two, that which has the superior obligation and validity ought, of course, to be preferred; or, in other words, the Constitution ought to be preferred to the statute.\"\n\n\nConstraints\nThe Supreme Court cannot directly enforce its rulings; instead, it relies on respect for the Constitution and for the law for adherence to its judgments One notable instance of nonacquiescence came in 1832, when the state of Georgia ignored the Supreme Court's decision in Worcester v Georgia President Andrew Jackson, who sided with the Georgia courts, is supposed to have remarked, \"John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!\" [233] Some state governments in the South also resisted the desegregation of public schools after the 1954 judgment Brown v Board of Education More recently, many feared that President Nixon would refuse to comply with the court's order in United States v Nixon (1974) to surrender the Watergate tapes [234] Nixon ultimately complied with the Supreme Court's ruling [235]\n\n\nLaw clerks\nEach Supreme Court justice hires several law clerks to review petitions for writ of certiorari, research them, prepare bench memorandums, and draft opinions Associate justices are allowed four clerks The chief justice is allowed five clerks, but Chief Justice Rehnquist hired only three per year, and Chief Justice Roberts usually hires only four [239] Generally, law clerks serve a term of one to two years.\n\n\nPoliticization of the court\nClerks hired by each of the justices of the Supreme Court are often given considerable leeway in the opinions they draft \"Supreme Court clerkship appeared to be a nonpartisan institution from the 1940s into the 1980s,\" according to a study published in 2009 by the law review of Vanderbilt University Law School [242] [243] \"As law has moved closer to mere politics, political affiliations have naturally and predictably become proxies for the different political agendas that have been pressed in and through the courts,\" former federal court of appeals judge J Michael Luttig said [242] David J Garrow, professor of history at the University of Cambridge, stated that the court had thus begun to mirror the political branches of government \"We are getting a composition of the clerk workforce that is getting to be like the House of Representatives,\" Professor Garrow said \"Each side is putting forward only ideological purists.\" [242] According to the Vanderbilt Law Review study, this politicized hiring trend reinforces the impression that the Supreme Court is \"a superlegislature responding to ideological arguments rather than a legal institution responding to concerns grounded in the rule of law.\" [242]\n\n\nCriticism and controversies\nThe following are some of the criticisms and controversies about the Court that are not discussed in previous sections.\n\n\nApproval ratings\nPublic trust in the court peaked in the late 1980s Since the 2022 Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v Wade and permitted states to restrict abortion rights, Democrats and independents have increasingly lost trust in the court, seen the court as political, and expressed support for reforming the institution [250] Historically, the court had relatively more trust than other government institutions [251]\n\n\nComposition and selection\nThe electoral college (which elects the President who nominates the justices) and the U.S Senate which confirms the justices, have selection biases that favor rural states that tend to vote Republican, resulting in a conservative Supreme Court [254] Ziblatt and Levitsky estimate that 3 or 4 of the seats held by conservative justices on the court would be held by justices appointed by a Democratic president if the Presidency and Senate were selected directly by the popular vote [255] The three Trump appointees to the court were all nominated by a president who finished second in the popular vote and confirmed by Senators representing a minority of Americans [256] In addition, Clarence Thomas' confirmation in 1991 and Merrick Garland's blocked confirmation in 2016 were both decided by senators representing a minority of Americans [257] Greg Price also critiqued the Court as minority rule [258]\n\n\nEthics\nSCOTUS justices have come under greater scrutiny since 2022, [267] following public disclosures that began with the founder of Faith and Action admissions regarding the organization's long-term influence-peddling scheme, dubbed \"Operation Higher Court\", designed for wealthy donors among the religious right to gain access to the justices through events held by The Supreme Court Historical Society [268] [269] [270] [271]\n\n\nCode of Conduct\nOn November 13, 2023, the court issued its first-ever Code of Conduct for Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States to set \"ethics rules and principles that guide the conduct of the Members of the Court.\" [301] [302] The Code has been received by some as a significant first step [303] but does not address the ethics concerns of many notable critics who found the Code was a significantly weakened version of the rules for other federal judges, let alone the legislature and the executive branch, while also lacking an enforcement mechanism [301] [304] [305] The Code's commentary denied past wrongdoing by saying that the Justices have largely abided by these principles and are simply publishing them now [306] [307] [308] This has prompted some criticism that the court hopes to legitimize past and future scandals through this Code [309] [310]\n\n\nDemocratic backsliding\nThomas Keck argues that because the Court has historically not served as a strong bulwark for democracy, the Roberts Court has the opportunity to go down in history as a defender of democracy However, he believes that if the court shields Trump from criminal prosecution (after ensuring his access to the ballot), then the risks that come with an anti-democratic status-quo of the current court will outweigh the dangers that come from court reform (including court packing) [313] Aziz Z Huq points to the blocking progress of democratizing institutions, increasing the disparity in wealth and power, and empowering an authoritarian white nationalist movement as evidence that the Supreme Court has created a \"permanent minority\" incapable of being defeated democratically [314]\n\n\nIndividual rights\nSome of the most notable historical decisions that were criticized for failing to protect individual rights include the Dred Scott (1857) decision that said people of African descent could not be U.S citizens or enjoy constitutionally protected rights and privileges, [316] Plessy v Ferguson (1896) that upheld segregation under the doctrine of separate but equal, [317] the Civil Rights Cases (1883) and Slaughter-House Cases (1873) that all but undermined civil rights legislation enacted during the Reconstruction era [318]\n\n\nJudicial activism\nThe Supreme Court has been criticized for engaging in judicial activism This criticism is leveled by those who believe the court should not interpret the law in any way besides through the lens of past precedent or Textualism However, those on both sides of the political aisle often level this accusation at the court The debate around judicial activism typically involves accusing the other side of activism, whilst denying that your own side engages in it [327] [328]\n\n\nOutdated and an outlier\nForeign Policy writer Colm Quinn says that a criticism leveled at the court, as well as other American institutions, is that after two centuries they are beginning to look their age He cites four features of the United States Supreme Court that make it different from high courts in other countries, and help explain why polarization is an issue in the United States court: [334]\n\n\nPower\nMichael Waldman argued that no other country gives its Supreme Court as much power [335] Warren E Burger, before becoming Chief Justice, argued that since the Supreme Court has such \"unreviewable power\", it is likely to \"self-indulge itself\", and unlikely to \"engage in dispassionate analysis.\" [336] Larry Sabato wrote that the federal courts, and especially the Supreme Court, have excessive power [101] Suja A Thomas argues the Supreme Court has taken most of the constitutionally-defined power from juries in the United States for itself [337] thanks in part to the influence of legal elites and companies that prefer judges over juries [338] as well as the inability of the jury to defend its power [339]\n\n\nFederalism debate\nThere has been debate throughout American history about the boundary between federal and state power While Framers such as James Madison [344] and Alexander Hamilton [345] argued in The Federalist Papers that their then-proposed Constitution would not infringe on the power of state governments, [346] [347] [348] [349] others argue that expansive federal power is good and consistent with the Framers' wishes [350] The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution explicitly states that \"powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\"\n\n\nRuling on political questions\nSome Court decisions have been criticized for injecting the court into the political arena, and deciding questions that are the purview of the elected branches of government The Bush v Gore decision, in which the Supreme Court intervened in the 2000 presidential election, awarding George W Bush the presidency over Al Gore, received scrutiny as political based on the controversial justifications used by the five conservative justices to elevate a fellow conservative to the presidency [359] [317] [360] [361] [362] The ruling was also controversial in applying logic only for that race, as opposed to drawing on or creating consistent precedent [363]\n\n\nSecretive proceedings\nThe court has been criticized for keeping its deliberations hidden from public view [364] [365] For example, the increasing use of a 'shadow docket' facilitates the court making decisions in secret without knowing how each Justice came to their decision [366] [367] In 2024, after comparing the analysis of shadow-docket decisions to Kremlinology, Matt Ford called this trend of secrecy \"increasingly troubling\", arguing the court's power comes entirely from persuasion and explanation [368]\n\n\nToo few cases\nIan Millhiser of Vox speculates that the decades-long decline in cases heard could be due to the increasing political makeup of judges, that he says might be more interested in settling political disputes than legal ones [371]\n\n\nToo slow\nBritish constitutional scholar Adam Tomkins sees flaws in the American system of having courts (and specifically the Supreme Court) act as checks on the Executive and Legislative branches; he argues that because the courts must wait, sometimes for years, for cases to navigate their way through the system, their ability to restrain other branches is severely weakened [372] [373] In contrast, various other countries have a dedicated constitutional court that has original jurisdiction on constitutional claims brought by persons or political institutions; for example, the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany, which can declare a law unconstitutional when challenged.\n\n\nLeaks and inadvertent publications\nSometimes draft opinions are deliberately leaked or inadvertently released before they are published Such releases are often purported to harm the court's reputation [375] Chief Justice Roberts has previously described leaks as an \"egregious breach of trust\" that \"undermine the integrity of our operations\" in reference to the leaked draft opinion for Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization [376]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nSelected landmark Supreme Court decisions\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Supreme Court of the United States**\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States is the highest court in the federal judiciary of the United States. It was established by Article III of the United States Constitution and has the power to interpret laws and decide cases that involve federal statutes, the Constitution, and treaties.\n\n**History**\n\nThe court was established in 1789, with its first session held on February 1 of that year. The court initially had six members, including the chief justice and five associate justices. Over time, the number of justices has been increased to nine, with the most recent change occurring in 1869.\n\n**Early Beginnings**\n\nUnder the leadership of Chief Justices John Jay, William Cushing, and Oliver Ellsworth, the court heard few cases during its early years. The court's first decision, West v. Barnes, was rendered in 1791 and involved a procedural matter. The court lacked a home of its own and had little prestige, a situation that was not helped by the era's highest-profile case, Chisholm v. Georgia, which was reversed within two years by the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment.\n\n**From Taney to Taft**\n\nThe Taney Court, which served from 1836 to 1864, made several important rulings, including Sheldon v. Sill, which held that while Congress may not limit the subjects the Supreme Court may hear, it may limit the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts to prevent them from hearing cases dealing with certain subjects. The court is primarily remembered for its ruling in Dred Scott v. Sandford, which helped precipitate the American Civil War.\n\n**New Deal Era**\n\nDuring the Hughes, Stone, and Vinson courts (1930-1953), the court gained its own accommodation in 1935 and changed its interpretation of the Constitution, giving a broader reading to the powers of the federal government to facilitate President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. The court continued to favor government power, upholding the internment of Japanese Americans and the mandatory Pledge of Allegiance.\n\n**Burger, Rehnquist, and Roberts**\n\nThe Burger Court (1969-1986) saw a conservative shift and expanded Griswold's right to privacy to strike down abortion laws. The court divided deeply on affirmative action and campaign finance regulation, and wavered on the death penalty, ruling first that most applications were defective, but later that the death penalty itself was not unconstitutional.\n\n**Composition**\n\nThere are currently nine justices on the Supreme Court: Chief Justice John Roberts and eight associate justices. Among the current members of the court, Clarence Thomas is the longest-serving justice, with a tenure of 12,081 days (33 years, 27 days) as of November 19, 2024. The most recent justice to join the court is Ketanji Brown Jackson, whose tenure began on June 30, 2022, after being confirmed by the Senate on April 7.\n\n**Court Demographics**\n\nThe court currently has five male and four female justices. Among the nine justices, there are two African American justices (Thomas and Jackson) and one Hispanic justice (Sonia Sotomayor). One of the justices, Justice Alito, was born to at least one immigrant parent.\n\n**Judicial Leanings**\n\nJustices are nominated by the president in power and receive confirmation by the Senate, historically holding many of the views of the nominating president's political party. Lawyers use an abbreviated format to cite cases, with the citation including the volume number, page number, and year of the decision.\n\n**Term**\n\nA term of the Supreme Court commences on the first Monday of each October and continues until June or early July of the following year. Each term consists of alternating periods of around two weeks, known as sittings and recesses, during which justices hear cases and deliver rulings.\n\n**Institutional Powers**\n\nThe Supreme Court has the power of judicial review, which is the authority to interpret laws and decide cases that involve federal statutes, the Constitution, and treaties.

while debating the separation of powers between the legislative and executive departments that delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention established the parameters for the national judiciary [6] Creating a \"third branch\" of government was a novel idea [citation needed]; in the English tradition, judicial matters had been treated as an aspect of royal (executive) authority Early on, the delegates who were opposed to having a strong central government argued that national laws could be enforced by state courts, while others, including James Madison, advocated for a national judicial authority consisting of tribunals chosen by the national legislature It was proposed that the judiciary should have a role in checking the executive's power to veto or revise laws [citation needed]\n\n\nEarly beginnings\nUnder chief justices Jay, Rutledge, and Ellsworth (1789–1801), the court heard few cases; its first decision was West v Barnes (1791), a case involving procedure [14] As the court initially had only six members, every decision that it made by a majority was also made by two-thirds (voting four to two) [15] However, Congress has always allowed less than the court's full membership to make decisions, starting with a quorum of four justices in 1789 [16] The court lacked a home of its own and had little prestige, [17] a situation not helped by the era's highest-profile case, Chisholm v Georgia (1793), which was reversed within two years by the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment [18]\n\n\nFrom Taney to Taft\nThe Taney Court (1836–1864) made several important rulings, such as Sheldon v Sill, which held that while Congress may not limit the subjects the Supreme Court may hear, it may limit the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts to prevent them from hearing cases dealing with certain subjects [31] Nevertheless, it is primarily remembered for its ruling in Dred Scott v Sandford, [32] which helped precipitate the American Civil War [33] In the Reconstruction era, the Chase, Waite, and Fuller Courts (1864–1910) interpreted the new Civil War amendments to the Constitution [26] and developed the doctrine of substantive due process (Lochner v New York; [34] Adair v United States) [35] The size of the court was last changed in 1869, when it was set at nine.\n\n\nNew Deal era\nDuring the Hughes, Stone, and Vinson courts (1930–1953), the court gained its own accommodation in 1935 [39] and changed its interpretation of the Constitution, giving a broader reading to the powers of the federal government to facilitate President Franklin D Roosevelt's New Deal (most prominently West Coast Hotel Co v Parrish, Wickard v Filburn, United States v Darby, and United States v Butler) [40] [41] [42] During World War II, the court continued to favor government power, upholding the internment of Japanese Americans (Korematsu v United States) and the mandatory Pledge of Allegiance (Minersville School District v Gobitis) Nevertheless, Gobitis was soon repudiated (West Virginia State Board of Education v Barnette), and the Steel Seizure Case restricted the pro-government trend.\n\n\nBurger, Rehnquist, and Roberts\nThe Burger Court (1969–1986) saw a conservative shift [52] It also expanded Griswold's right to privacy to strike down abortion laws (Roe v Wade) [53] but divided deeply on affirmative action (Regents of the University of California v Bakke) [54] and campaign finance regulation (Buckley v Valeo) [55] It also wavered on the death penalty, ruling first that most applications were defective (Furman v Georgia), [56] but later that the death penalty itself was not unconstitutional (Gregg v Georgia) [56] [57] [58]\n\n\nComposition\nArticle II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution, known as the Appointments Clause, empowers the president to nominate and, with the confirmation (advice and consent) of the United States Senate, to appoint public officials, including justices of the Supreme Court This clause is one example of the system of checks and balances inherent in the Constitution The president has the plenary power to nominate, while the Senate possesses the plenary power to reject or confirm the nominee The Constitution sets no qualifications for service as a justice, such as age, citizenship, residence or prior judicial experience, thus a president may nominate anyone to serve, and the Senate may not set any qualifications or otherwise limit who the president can choose [80] [81] [82]\n\n\nNomination, confirmation, and appointment\nArticle II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution, known as the Appointments Clause, empowers the president to nominate and, with the confirmation (advice and consent) of the United States Senate, to appoint public officials, including justices of the Supreme Court This clause is one example of the system of checks and balances inherent in the Constitution The president has the plenary power to nominate, while the Senate possesses the plenary power to reject or confirm the nominee The Constitution sets no qualifications for service as a justice, such as age, citizenship, residence or prior judicial experience, thus a president may nominate anyone to serve, and the Senate may not set any qualifications or otherwise limit who the president can choose [80] [81] [82]\n\n\nRecess appointments\nWhen the Senate is in recess, a president may make temporary appointments to fill vacancies Recess appointees hold office only until the end of the next Senate session (less than two years) The Senate must confirm the nominee for them to continue serving; of the two chief justices and eleven associate justices who have received recess appointments, only Chief Justice John Rutledge was not subsequently confirmed [94]\n\n\nTenure\n\nLifetime tenure of justices can only be found for US federal judges and the State of Rhode Island's Supreme Court justices, with all other democratic nations and all other US states having set term limits or mandatory retirement ages [100] Larry Sabato wrote: \"The insularity of lifetime tenure, combined with the appointments of relatively young attorneys who give long service on the bench, produces senior judges representing the views of past generations better than views of the current day.\" [101] Sanford Levinson has been critical of justices who stayed in office despite medical deterioration based on longevity [102] James MacGregor Burns stated lifelong tenure has \"produced a critical time lag, with the Supreme Court institutionally almost always behind the times.\" [103] Proposals to solve these problems include term limits for justices, as proposed by Levinson [104] and Sabato [101] [105] and a mandatory retirement age proposed by Richard Epstein, [106] among others [107] Alexander Hamilton in Federalist 78 argued that one benefit of lifetime tenure was that, \"nothing can contribute so much to its firmness and independence as permanency in office.\" [108] [non-primary source needed]\n\nSize of the court\nOne of the smallest supreme courts in the world, the U.S Supreme Court consists of nine members: one chief justice and eight associate justices The U.S Constitution does not specify the size of the Supreme Court, nor does it specify any specific positions for the court's members The Constitution assumes the existence of the office of the chief justice, because it mentions in Article I, Section 3, Clause 6 that \"the Chief Justice\" must preside over impeachment trials of the President of the United States The power to define the Supreme Court's size and membership has been assumed to belong to Congress, which initially established a six-member Supreme Court composed of a chief justice and five associate justices through the Judiciary Act of 1789.\n\n\nMembership\nThere are currently nine justices on the Supreme Court: Chief Justice John Roberts and eight associate justices Among the current members of the court, Clarence Thomas is the longest-serving justice, with a tenure of 12,081 days (33 years, 27 days) as of November 19, 2024; the most recent justice to join the court is Ketanji Brown Jackson, whose tenure began on June 30, 2022, after being confirmed by the Senate on April 7 [134]\n\n\nCurrent justices\nThere are currently nine justices on the Supreme Court: Chief Justice John

justices was born to at least one immigrant parent: Justice Alito's father was born in Italy [137] [138]\n\n\nJudicial leanings\nJustices are nominated by the president in power, and receive confirmation by the Senate, historically holding many of the views of the nominating president's political party While justices do not represent or receive official endorsements from political parties, as is accepted practice in the legislative and executive branches, organizations such as the Federalist Society do officially filter and endorse judges that have a sufficiently conservative view of the law Jurists are often informally categorized in the media as being conservatives or liberal Attempts to quantify the ideologies of jurists include the Segal–Cover score, Martin-Quinn score, and Judicial Common Space score [152] [153]\n\n\nRetired justices\nThere are currently three living retired justices of the Supreme Court of the United States: Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, and Stephen Breyer As retired justices, they no longer participate in the work of the Supreme Court, but may be designated for temporary assignments to sit on lower federal courts, usually the United States Courts of Appeals Such assignments are formally made by the chief justice, on request of the chief judge of the lower court and with the consent of the retired justice In recent years, Justice Souter has frequently sat on the First Circuit, the court of which he was briefly a member before joining the Supreme Court [164] The status of a retired justice is analogous to that of a circuit or district court judge who has taken senior status, and eligibility of a Supreme Court justice to assume retired status (rather than simply resign from the bench) is governed by the same age and service criteria.\n\n\nSalary\nAs of 2024, associate justices receive a yearly salary of $298,500 and the chief justice is paid $312,200 per year [169] Once a justice meets age and service requirements, the justice may retire with a pension based on the same formula used for federal employees As with other federal courts judges, their pension can never be less than their salary at the time of retirement according to the Compensation Clause of Article III of the Constitution [citation needed]\n\n\nSeniority and seating\nFor the most part, the day-to-day activities of the justices are governed by rules of protocol based upon the seniority of justices The chief justice always ranks first in the order of precedence—regardless of the length of their service [170] The associate justices are then ranked by the length of their service The chief justice sits in the center on the bench, or at the head of the table during conferences The other justices are seated in order of seniority The senior-most associate justice sits immediately to the chief justice's right; the second most senior sits immediately to their left The seats alternate right to left in order of seniority, with the most junior justice occupying the last seat [171] Therefore, since the October 2022 term, the court sits as follows from left to right, from the perspective of those facing the court: Barrett, Gorsuch, Sotomayor, Thomas (most senior associate justice), Roberts (chief justice), Alito, Kagan, Kavanaugh, and Jackson Likewise, when the members of the court gather for official group photographs, justices are arranged in order of seniority, with the five most senior members seated in the front row in the same order as they would sit during Court sessions (currently, from left to right, Sotomayor, Thomas, Roberts, Alito, and Kagan), and the four most junior justices standing behind them, again in the same order as they would sit during Court sessions (Barrett, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Jackson).\n\n\nFacilities\nThe Supreme Court first met on February 1, 1790, at the Merchants' Exchange Building in New York City When Philadelphia became the capital, the court met briefly in Independence Hall before settling in Old City Hall from 1791 until 1800 After the government moved to Washington, D.C., the court occupied various spaces in the Capitol building until 1935, when it moved into its own purpose-built home The four-story building was designed by Cass Gilbert in a classical style sympathetic to the surrounding buildings of the Capitol and Library of Congress, and is clad in marble The building includes the courtroom, justices' chambers, an extensive law library, various meeting spaces, and auxiliary services including a gymnasium The Supreme Court building is within the ambit of the Architect of the Capitol, but maintains its own Supreme Court Police, separate from the Capitol Police [173]\n\n\nJurisdiction\nCongress is authorized by Article III of the federal Constitution to regulate the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction.\n\n\nOriginal jurisdiction\nThe Supreme Court has original and exclusive jurisdiction over cases between two or more states [178] but may decline to hear such cases [179] It also possesses original but not exclusive jurisdiction to hear \"all actions or proceedings to which ambassadors, other public ministers, consuls, or vice consuls of foreign states are parties; all controversies between the United States and a State; and all actions or proceedings by a State against the citizens of another State or against aliens.\" [180]\n\n\nAppellate jurisdiction\nThe court's appellate jurisdiction consists of appeals from federal courts of appeal (through certiorari, certiorari before judgment, and certified questions), [186] the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (through certiorari), [187] the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico (through certiorari), [188] the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands (through certiorari), [189] the District of Columbia Court of Appeals (through certiorari), [190] and \"final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had\" (through certiorari) [190] In the last case, an appeal may be made to the Supreme Court from a lower state court if the state's highest court declined to hear an appeal or lacks jurisdiction to hear an appeal For example, a decision rendered by one of the Florida District Courts of Appeal can be appealed to the U.S Supreme Court if (a) the Supreme Court of Florida declined to grant certiorari, e.g Florida Star v B J F., or (b) the district court of appeal issued a per curiam decision simply affirming the lower court's decision without discussing the merits of the case, since the Supreme Court of Florida lacks jurisdiction to hear appeals of such decisions [191] The power of the Supreme Court to consider appeals from state courts, rather than just federal courts, was created by the Judiciary Act of 1789 and upheld early in the court's history, by its rulings in Martin v Hunter's Lessee (1816) and Cohens v Virginia (1821) The Supreme Court is the only federal court that has jurisdiction over direct appeals from state court decisions, although there are several devices that permit so-called \"collateral review\" of state cases This \"collateral review\" often only applies to individuals on death row and not through the regular judicial system [192]\n\n\nJustices as circuit justices\nThe United States is divided into thirteen circuit courts of appeals, each of which is assigned a \"circuit justice\" from the Supreme Court Although this concept has been in continuous existence throughout the history of the republic, its meaning has changed through time Under the Judiciary Act of 1789, each justice was required to \"ride circuit\", or to travel within the assigned circuit and consider cases alongside local judges This practice encountered opposition from many justices, who cited the difficulty of travel Moreover, there was a potential for a conflict of interest on the court if a justice had previously decided the same case while riding circuit Circuit riding ended in 1901, when the Circuit Court of Appeals Act was passed, and circuit riding was officially abolished by Congress in 1911 [194]\n\n\nProcess\nNearly all cases come before the court by way of petitions for writs of certiorari, commonly referred to as cert, upon which the court grants a writ of certiorari The court may review via this process any civil or criminal case in the federal courts of appeals [200] It may also review by certiorari a final judgment of the highest court of a state if the judgment involves a question of federal statutory or constitutional law [201] A case may alternatively come before the court as a direct appeal from a three-judge federal district court [202] The party that petitions the court for review is the petitioner and the non-mover is the respondent.\n\n\nCase selection\nNearly all cases come before the court by way of petitions for writs of certiorari, commonly referred to as cert, upon which the court grants a writ of certiorari The court may review via this process any civil or criminal case in the federal courts of appeals [200] It may also review by certiorari a final judgment of the highest court of a state if the judgment involves a question of federal statutory or constitutional law [201] A case may alternatively come before the court as a direct appeal from a three-judge federal district court [202] The party that petitions the court for review is the petitioner and the non-mover is the respondent.\n\n\nWritten evidence\nThe Court also relies on and cites amicus briefs, law review articles, and other written works for their decisions While law review article use has increased slightly with one article cited per decision on average, [210] the use of amicus briefs has increased significantly [211] The use of amicus briefs has received criticism, including the ability of authors to discuss topics outside their expertise (unlike in lower courts), [211] with documented examples of falsehoods in written opinions, often supplied to the justices by amicus briefs from groups advocating a particular outcome [212] The lack of funding transparency and the lack of a requirement to submit them earlier in the process also make it more difficult to fact-check and understand the credibility of amicus briefs [211]\n\n\nOral argument\nWhen the court grants a cert petition, the case is set for oral argument Both parties will file briefs on the merits of the case, as distinct from the reasons they may have argued for granting or denying the cert petition With the consent of the parties or approval of the court, amici curiae, or \"friends of the court\", may also file briefs The court holds two-week oral argument sessions each month from October through April Each side has thirty minutes to present its argument (the court may choose to give more time, although this is rare), [213] and during that time, the justices may interrupt the advocate and ask questions In 2019, the court adopted a rule generally allowing advocates to speak uninterrupted for the first two minutes of their argument [214] The petitioner gives the first presentation, and may reserve some time to rebut the respondent's arguments after the respondent has concluded Amici curiae may also present oral argument on behalf of one party if that party agrees The court advises counsel to assume that the justices are familiar with and have read the briefs filed in a case.\n\n\nDecision\nAt the conclusion of oral argument, the case is submitted for decision Cases are decided by majority vote of the justices After the oral argument is concluded, usually in the same week as the case was submitted, the justices retire to another conference at which the preliminary votes are tallied and the court sees which side has prevailed One of the justices in the majority is then assigned to write the court's opinion, also known as the \"majority opinion\", an assignment made by the most senior justice in the majority, with the chief justice always being considered the most senior Drafts of the court's opinion circulate among the justices until the court is prepared to announce the judgment in a particular case [215]\n\n\nPublished opinions\nThe court's opinions are published in three stages First, a slip opinion is made available on the court's web site and through other outlets Next, several opinions and lists of the court's orders are bound together in paperback form, called a preliminary print of United States Reports, the official series of books in which the final version of the court's opinions appears About a year after the preliminary prints are issued, a final bound volume of U.S Reports is issued by the Reporter of Decisions The individual volumes of U.S Reports are numbered so that users may cite this set of reports (or a competing version published by another commercial legal publisher but containing parallel citations) to allow those who read their pleadings and other briefs to find the cases quickly and easily As of January 2019 [update], there are:\n\n\nCitations to published opinions\nLawyers use an abbreviated format to cite cases, in the form \"vol U.S page, pin (year)\", where vol is the volume number, page is the page number on which the opinion begins, and year is the year in which the case was decided Optionally, pin is used to \"pinpoint\" to a specific page number within the opinion For instance, the citation for Roe v Wade is 410 U.S 113 (1973), which means the case was decided in 1973 and appears on page 113 of volume 410 of U.S Reports For opinions or orders that have not yet been published in the preliminary print, the volume and page numbers may be replaced with ___\n\n\nSupreme Court bar\nIn order to plead before the court, an attorney must first be admitted to the court's bar Approximately 4,000 lawyers join the bar each year The bar contains an estimated 230,000 members In reality, pleading is limited to several hundred attorneys [citation needed] The rest join for a one-time fee of $200, with the court collecting about $750,000 annually Attorneys can be admitted as either individuals or as groups The group admission is held before the current justices of the Supreme Court, wherein the chief justice approves a motion to admit the new attorneys [226] Lawyers commonly apply for the cosmetic value of a certificate to display in their office or on their resume They also receive access to better seating if they wish to attend an oral argument [227] Members of the Supreme Court Bar are also granted access to the collections of the Supreme Court Library [228]\n\n\nTerm\nA term of the Supreme Court commences on the first Monday of each October, and continues until June or early July of the following year Each term consists of alternating periods of around two weeks known as \"sittings\" and \"recesses\"; justices hear cases and deliver rulings during sittings, and discuss cases and write opinions during recesses [229]\n\n\nInstitutional powers\nThe federal court system and the judicial authority to interpret the Constitution received little attention in the debates over the drafting and ratification of the Constitution The power of judicial review, in fact, is nowhere mentioned in it Over the ensuing years, the question of whether the power of judicial review was even intended by the drafters of the Constitution was quickly frustrated by the lack of evidence bearing on the question either way [230] Nevertheless, the power of judiciary to overturn laws and executive actions it determines are unlawful or unconstitutional is a well-established precedent Many of the Founding Fathers accepted the notion of judicial review; in Federalist No 78, Alexander Hamilton wrote: \"A Constitution is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, and the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two, that which has the superior obligation and validity ought, of course, to be preferred; or, in other words, the Constitution ought to be preferred to the statute.\"\n\n\nConstraints\nThe Supreme Court cannot directly enforce its rulings; instead, it relies on respect for the Constitution and for the law for adherence to its judgments One notable instance of nonacquiescence came in 1832, when the state of Georgia ignored the Supreme Court's decision in Worcester v Georgia President Andrew Jackson, who sided with the Georgia courts, is supposed to have remarked, \"John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!\" [233] Some state governments in the South also resisted the desegregation of public schools after the 1954 judgment Brown v Board of Education More recently, many feared that President Nixon would refuse to comply with the court's order in United States v Nixon (1974) to surrender the Watergate tapes [234] Nixon ultimately complied with the Supreme Court's ruling [235]\n\n\nLaw clerks\nEach Supreme Court justice hires several law clerks to review petitions for writ of certiorari, research them, prepare bench memorandums, and draft opinions Associate justices are allowed four clerks The chief justice is allowed five clerks, but Chief Justice Rehnquist hired only three per year, and Chief Justice Roberts usually hires only four [239] Generally, law clerks serve a term of one to two years.\n\n\nPoliticization of the court\nClerks hired by each of the justices of the Supreme Court are often given considerable leeway in the opinions they draft \"Supreme Court clerkship appeared to be a nonpartisan institution from the 1940s into the 1980s,\" according to a study published in 2009 by the law review of Vanderbilt University Law School [242] [243] \"As law has moved closer to mere politics, political affiliations have naturally and predictably become proxies for the different political agendas that have been pressed in and through the courts,\" former federal court of appeals judge J Michael Luttig said [242] David J Garrow, professor of history at the University of Cambridge, stated that the court had thus begun to mirror the political branches of government \"We are getting a composition of the clerk workforce that is getting to be like the House of Representatives,\" Professor Garrow said \"Each side is putting forward only ideological purists.\" [242] According to the Vanderbilt Law Review study, this politicized hiring trend reinforces the impression that the Supreme Court is \"a superlegislature responding to ideological arguments rather than a legal institution responding to concerns grounded in the rule of law.\" [242]\n\n\nCriticism and controversies\nThe following are some of the criticisms and controversies about the Court that are not discussed in previous sections.\n\n\nApproval ratings\nPublic trust in the court peaked in the late 1980s Since the 2022 Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v Wade and permitted states to restrict abortion rights, Democrats and independents have increasingly lost trust in the court, seen the court as political, and expressed support for reforming the institution [250] Historically, the court had relatively more trust than other government institutions [251]\n\n\nComposition and selection\nThe electoral college (which elects the President who nominates the justices) and the U.S Senate which confirms the justices, have selection biases that favor rural states that tend to vote Republican, resulting in a conservative Supreme Court [254] Ziblatt and Levitsky estimate that 3 or 4 of the seats held by conservative justices on the court would be held by justices appointed by a Democratic president if the Presidency and Senate were selected directly by the popular vote [255] The three Trump appointees to the court were all nominated by a president who finished second in the popular vote and confirmed by Senators representing a minority of Americans [256] In addition, Clarence Thomas' confirmation in 1991 and Merrick Garland's blocked confirmation in 2016 were both decided by senators representing a minority of Americans [257] Greg Price also critiqued the Court as minority rule [258]\n\n\nEthics\nSCOTUS justices have come under greater scrutiny since 2022, [267] following public disclosures that began with the founder of Faith and Action admissions regarding the organization's long-term influence-peddling scheme, dubbed \"Operation Higher Court\", designed for wealthy donors among the religious right to gain access to the justices through events held by The Supreme Court Historical Society [268] [269] [270] [271]\n\n\nCode of Conduct\nOn November 13, 2023, the court issued its first-ever Code of Conduct for Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States to set \"ethics rules and principles that guide the conduct of the Members of the Court.\" [301] [302] The Code has been received by some as a significant first step [303] but does not address the ethics concerns of many notable critics who found the Code was a significantly weakened version of the rules for other federal judges, let alone the legislature and the executive branch, while also lacking an enforcement mechanism [301] [304] [305] The Code's commentary denied past wrongdoing by saying that the Justices have largely abided by these principles and are simply publishing them now [306] [307] [308] This has prompted some criticism that the court hopes to legitimize past and future scandals through this Code [309] [310]\n\n\nDemocratic backsliding\nThomas Keck argues that because the Court has historically not served as a strong bulwark for democracy, the Roberts Court has the opportunity to go down in history as a defender of democracy However, he believes that if the court shields Trump from criminal prosecution (after ensuring his access to the ballot), then the risks that come with an anti-democratic status-quo of the current court will outweigh the dangers that come from court reform (including court packing) [313] Aziz Z Huq points to the blocking progress of democratizing institutions, increasing the disparity in wealth and power, and empowering an authoritarian white nationalist movement as evidence that the Supreme Court has created a \"permanent minority\" incapable of being defeated democratically [314]\n\n\nIndividual rights\nSome of the most notable historical decisions that were criticized for failing to protect individual rights include the Dred Scott (1857) decision that said people of African descent could not be U.S citizens or enjoy constitutionally protected rights and privileges, [316] Plessy v Ferguson (1896) that upheld segregation under the doctrine of separate but equal, [317] the Civil Rights Cases (1883) and Slaughter-House Cases (1873) that all but undermined civil rights legislation enacted during the Reconstruction era [318]\n\n\nJudicial activism\nThe Supreme Court has been criticized for engaging in judicial activism This criticism is leveled by those who believe the court should not interpret the law in any way besides through the lens of past precedent or Textualism However, those on both sides of the political aisle often level this accusation at the court The debate around judicial activism typically involves accusing the other side of activism, whilst denying that your own side engages in it [327] [328]\n\n\nOutdated and an outlier\nForeign Policy writer Colm Quinn says that a criticism leveled at the court, as well as other American institutions, is that after two centuries they are beginning to look their age He cites four features of the United States Supreme Court that make it different from high courts in other countries, and help explain why polarization is an issue in the United States court: [334]\n\n\nPower\nMichael Waldman argued that no other country gives its Supreme Court as much power [335] Warren E Burger, before becoming Chief Justice, argued that since the Supreme Court has such \"unreviewable power\", it is likely to \"self-indulge itself\", and unlikely to \"engage in dispassionate analysis.\" [336] Larry Sabato wrote that the federal courts, and especially the Supreme Court, have excessive power [101] Suja A Thomas argues the Supreme Court has taken most of the constitutionally-defined power from juries in the United States for itself [337] thanks in part to the influence of legal elites and companies that prefer judges over juries [338] as well as the inability of the jury to defend its power [339]\n\n\nFederalism debate\nThere has been debate throughout American history about the boundary between federal and state power While Framers such as James Madison [344] and Alexander Hamilton [345] argued in The Federalist Papers that their then-proposed Constitution would not infringe on the power of state governments, [346] [347] [348] [349] others argue that expansive federal power is good and consistent with the Framers' wishes [350] The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution explicitly states that \"powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\"\n\n\nRuling on political questions\nSome Court decisions have been criticized for injecting the court into the political arena, and deciding questions that are the purview of the elected branches of government The Bush v Gore decision, in which the Supreme Court intervened in the 2000 presidential election, awarding George W Bush the presidency over Al Gore, received scrutiny as political based on the controversial justifications used by the five conservative justices to elevate a fellow conservative to the presidency [359] [317] [360] [361] [362] The ruling was also controversial in applying logic only for that race, as opposed to drawing on or creating consistent precedent [363]\n\n\nSecretive proceedings\nThe court has been criticized for keeping its deliberations hidden from public view [364] [365] For example, the increasing use of a 'shadow docket' facilitates the court making decisions in secret without knowing how each Justice came to their decision [366] [367] In 2024, after comparing the analysis of shadow-docket decisions to Kremlinology, Matt Ford called this trend of secrecy \"increasingly troubling\", arguing the court's power comes entirely from persuasion and explanation [368]\n\n\nToo few cases\nIan Millhiser of Vox speculates that the decades-long decline in cases heard could be due to the increasing political makeup of judges, that he says might be more interested in settling political disputes than legal ones [371]\n\n\nToo slow\nBritish constitutional scholar Adam Tomkins sees flaws in the American system of having courts (and specifically the Supreme Court) act as checks on the Executive and Legislative branches; he argues that because the courts must wait, sometimes for years, for cases to navigate their way through the system, their ability to restrain other branches is severely weakened [372] [373] In contrast, various other countries have a dedicated constitutional court that has original jurisdiction on constitutional claims brought by persons or political institutions; for example, the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany, which can declare a law unconstitutional when challenged.\n\n\nLeaks and inadvertent publications\nSometimes draft opinions are deliberately leaked or inadvertently released before they are published Such releases are often purported to harm the court's reputation [375] Chief Justice Roberts has previously described leaks as an \"egregious breach of trust\" that \"undermine the integrity of our operations\" in reference to the leaked draft opinion for Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization [376]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nSelected landmark Supreme Court decisions\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

out of university, in 2001 Dornan took part in the Channel 4 reality show Model Behaviour [21] He was eliminated, but signed a modelling contract with Select Model Management [21] Dornan was not keen to pursue modelling as a career, but was persuaded by his sisters [22] In 2003, he modelled for Abercrombie & Fitch with Malin Åkerman [23] He then modelled for Aquascutum, Hugo Boss, and Armani [24] In 2005, he became the face of Dior Homme's fragrance advertising campaign [25] Dornan's first appearance in Calvin Klein's advertising campaign was in 2004 with Russian model Natalia Vodianova [26] His later notable works for the brand include the jeans advertising campaigns with Kate Moss in 2006 [27] and with Eva Mendes in 2010 [28] In 2009, he was made the face of Calvin Klein's 'CK Free' fragrance [29] and also appeared as a judge in its model hunt competition, Nine countries, nine men, one winner that year [30] In 2006, he was labelled \"The Golden Torso\" by The New York Times [31] [32] and  was dubbed the \"male Kate Moss\" by GQ's creative director Jim Moore [31]\n\n\nActing career\nDornan's first acting role in a film was as Count Axel Fersen in the Sofia Coppola film Marie Antoinette (2006) [41] Afterwards, he unsuccessfully auditioned for many roles [42] while appearing in films  Beyond the Rave (2008), [43] Shadows in the Sun (2009) [44] When asked if the transition into an acting career was problematic, Dornan stated that the \"model turned actor\" label held a significant stigma [2] He struggled with auditions and casting agents who treated him only as a model, [45] but he had always wanted to act and so, auditioned in the pilot season in Los Angeles [46] Initially interested in comedy, he had meetings with Funny or Die, wrote a comic blog for them that did not get published, he recalled: \"I used to always want to do comedy, and then I just didn't I ended up quite far away from that path.\" [47]\n\n\n2006–2012: Career beginnings\nDornan's first acting role in a film was as Count Axel Fersen in the Sofia Coppola film Marie Antoinette (2006) [41] Afterwards, he unsuccessfully auditioned for many roles [42] while appearing in films  Beyond the Rave

from that path.\" [47]\n\n\n2013–2015: Breakthrough with The Fall and Fifty Shades trilogy\nDornan's breakout role was alongside Gillian Anderson in the Northern Irish drama series The Fall, where he played Paul Spector, a serial killer terrorising Belfast [51] [52] He initially auditioned for the role of a police officer, but was later called upon to audition for the lead role, for which he was eventually selected [53] He read books about serial killers and watched interviews of Ted Bundy to get an understanding of the mindset of his character, [54] and stalked a woman in his preparation for the role [55] He wanted to play the character with \"real stillness\" [56] Beginning in 2013, the show aired for three series ending in October 2016 [57] Critic Ken Tucker opined that Dornan was \"handsome and skilled\" [58] David Thomson of The New Republic complimented him on his performance: \"Jamie Dornan as Paul, has become the center of the drama in a performance that unpeels as slowly as a stripper- and maybe as seductively.\" [59] He won the Irish Film and Television Award for Best Actor in Television [60] and was nominated for a British Academy Television Award for Best Actor [40] He has said The Fall changed his professional horizons [61] He later appeared in Flying Home (2014), [62] a romantic drama film and New Worlds (2015), a historical drama series [63]\n\n\n2016–2021: Transition to independent film roles and Belfast\nIn 2016, Dornan starred as Commandant Pat Quinlan, who led the Irish UN force during The Siege of Jadotville, in Netflix's war film The Siege of Jadotville [74] He was sent to a boot camp in South Africa with the rest of the cast to train for the film [75] The film got released at the Galway Film Festival 2016, [76] receiving mixed reviews [77] Writing for The Irish Times, critic Donald Clarke took note of Dornan's \"suave acting\" [78] He received a nomination for the Irish Film and Television Award for Best Actor − Film

{"title": "Pink_Floyd", "content": "\nHistory\nThe founding members of Pink Floyd were Roger Waters, Nick Mason, and Richard Wright, who enrolled at the London Polytechnic at Regent Street in September 1962 to study architecture, [2] and Syd Barrett, two years younger than the rest of the band, who had moved to London in 1964 to study at the Camberwell College of Arts [3] Waters and Barrett were childhood friends; Waters had often visited Barrett and watched him play guitar at Barrett's mother's house [4] Mason said about Barrett: \"In a period when everyone was being cool in a very adolescent, self-conscious way, Syd was unfashionably outgoing; my enduring memory of our first encounter is the fact that he bothered to come up and introduce himself to me.\" [5]\n\n\n1963–1965: formation\nWaters and Mason met while studying architecture at the London Polytechnic at Regent Street [2] They first played music together in a group formed by fellow students Keith Noble and Clive Metcalfe, [6] with Noble's sister Sheilagh Richard Wright, a fellow architecture student, [nb 1] joined later that year, and the group became a sextet, Sigma 6 Waters played lead guitar, Mason drums, and Wright rhythm guitar, later moving to keyboards [8] The band performed at private functions and rehearsed in a tearoom in the basement of the Regent Street Polytechnic They performed songs by the Searchers and material written by their manager and songwriter, fellow student Ken Chapman [9]\n\n\nPreceding the band\nWaters and Mason met while studying architecture at the London Polytechnic at Regent Street [2] They first played music together in a group formed by fellow students Keith Noble and Clive Metcalfe, [6] with Noble's sister Sheilagh Richard Wright, a fellow architecture student, [nb 1] joined later that year, and the group became a sextet, Sigma 6 Waters played lead guitar, Mason drums, and Wright rhythm guitar, later moving to keyboards [8] The band performed at private functions and rehearsed in a tearoom in the basement of the Regent Street Polytechnic They performed songs by the Searchers and material written by their manager and songwriter, fellow student Ken Chapman [9]\n\n\n1965–1967: early years\nThe group rebranded as the Pink Floyd Sound in late 1965 Barrett created the name on the spur of the moment when he discovered that another band, also called the Tea Set, were to perform at one of their gigs [24] The name is derived from the given names of two blues musicians whose Piedmont blues records Barrett had in his collection, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council [25] By 1966, the group's repertoire consisted mainly of rhythm and blues songs, and they had begun to receive paid bookings, including a performance at the Marquee Club in December 1966, where Peter Jenner, a lecturer at the London School of Economics, noticed them Jenner was impressed by the sonic effects Barrett and Wright created and, with his business partner and friend Andrew King, became their manager [26] The pair had little experience in the music industry and used King's inheritance to set up Blackhill Enterprises, purchasing about £1,000 (equivalent to £23,500 in 2023 [27]) worth of new instruments and equipment for the band [nb 7]  Around this time, Jenner suggested the band drop the \"Sound\" from their name [29]\n\n\nPink Floyd\nThe group rebranded as the Pink Floyd Sound in late 1965 Barrett created the name on the spur of the moment when he discovered that another band, also called the Tea Set, were to perform at one of their gigs [24] The name is derived from the given names of two blues musicians whose Piedmont blues records Barrett had in his collection, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council [25] By 1966, the group's repertoire consisted mainly of rhythm and blues songs, and they had begun to receive paid bookings, including a performance at the Marquee Club in December 1966, where Peter Jenner, a lecturer at the London School of Economics, noticed them Jenner was impressed by the sonic effects Barrett and Wright created and, with his business partner and friend Andrew King, became their manager [26] The pair had little experience in the music industry and used King's inheritance to set up Blackhill Enterprises, purchasing about £1,000 (equivalent to £23,500 in 2023 [27]) worth of new instruments and equipment for the band [nb 7]  Around this time, Jenner suggested the band drop the \"Sound\" from their name [29]\n\n\nSigning with EMI\nIn 1967, Pink Floyd began to attract the attention of the music industry [37] [nb 8] While in negotiations with record companies, IT co-founder and UFO club manager Joe Boyd and Pink Floyd's booking agent, Bryan Morrison, arranged and funded a recording session at Sound Techniques in Kensington [39] On 15 February 1967, Pink Floyd signed with EMI, receiving a £5,000 advance (equivalent to £114,600 in 2023 [27]) EMI released the band's first single, \"Arnold Layne\", with the B-side \"Candy and a Currant Bun\", on 10 March 1967 on its Columbia label [40] [nb 9] Both tracks were recorded on 29 January 1967 [41] [nb 10] \"Arnold Layne\"'s references to cross-dressing led to a ban by several radio stations; however, creative manipulation by the retailers who supplied sales figures to the music business meant that the single reached number 20 in the UK [43]\n\n\nThe Piper at the Gates of Dawn\nMorrison and EMI producer Norman Smith negotiated Pink Floyd's first recording contract As part of the deal, the band agreed to record their first album at EMI Studios in London [49] [nb 11] Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism [51] EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967 The album reached number six, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts [52] One month later, it was released under the Tower Records label [53] Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child, who commented: \"I found  [Barrett] in the dressing room and he was so .. gone Roger Waters and I got him on his feet,  [and] we got him out to the stage .. The band started to play and Syd just stood there He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down\" [54]\n\n\n1967–1978: transition and international success\nIn December 1967, reaching a crisis point with Barrett, Pink Floyd added guitarist David Gilmour as the fifth member [65] [66] [nb 15] Gilmour already knew Barrett, having studied with him at Cambridge Tech in the early 1960s [4] The two had performed at lunchtimes together with guitars and harmonicas, and later hitch-hiked and busked their way around the south of France [68] In 1965, while a member of Joker's Wild, Gilmour had watched the Tea Set [69]\n\n\n1967: replacement of Barrett by Gilmour\nIn December 1967, reaching a crisis point with Barrett, Pink Floyd added guitarist David Gilmour as the fifth member [65] [66] [nb 15] Gilmour already knew Barrett, having studied with him at Cambridge Tech in the early 1960s [4] The two had performed at lunchtimes together with guitars and harmonicas, and later hitch-hiked and busked their way around the south of France [68] In 1965, while a member of Joker's Wild, Gilmour had watched the Tea Set [69]\n\n\nA Saucerful of Secrets (1968)\nIn 1968, Pink Floyd returned to Abbey Road Studios to complete their second album, A Saucerful of Secrets, which they had begun in 1967 under Barrett's leadership The album included Barrett's final contribution to their discography, \"Jugband Blues\" Waters developed his own songwriting, contributing \"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\", \"Let There Be More Light\", and \"Corporal Clegg\" Wright composed \"See-Saw\" and \"Remember a Day\" Norman Smith encouraged them to self-produce their music, and they recorded demos of new material at their houses With Smith's instruction at Abbey Road, they learned how to use the recording studio to realise their artistic vision However, Smith remained unconvinced by their music, and when Mason struggled to perform his drum part on \"Remember a Day\", Smith stepped in as his replacement [85] Wright recalled Smith's attitude about the sessions, \"Norman gave up on the second album .. he was forever saying things like, 'You can't do twenty minutes of this ridiculous noise'\" [86] As neither Waters nor Mason could read music, to illustrate the structure of \"A Saucerful of Secrets\", they invented their own system of notation Gilmour later described their method as looking \"like an architectural diagram\" [87]\n\n\nUmmagumma (1969) and Atom Heart Mother (1970)\nUmmagumma represented a departure from Pink Floyd's previous work Released as a double LP on EMI's Harvest label, the first two sides contained live performances recorded at Manchester College of Commerce and Mothers, a club in Birmingham The second LP contained a single experimental contribution from each band member [93] Ummagumma was released in November 1969 and received positive reviews [94] It reached number five, spending 21 weeks on the UK chart [52]\nIn October 1970, Pink Floyd released Atom Heart Mother [95] [nb 20] An early version premièred in England in mid January, but disagreements over the mix prompted the hiring of Ron Geesin to work out the sound problems Geesin worked to improve the score, but with little creative input from the band, production was troublesome Geesin eventually completed the project with the aid of John Alldis, who was the director of the choir hired to perform on the record Smith earned an executive producer credit, and the album marked his final official contribution to the band's discography Gilmour said it was \"A neat way of saying that he didn't .. do anything\" [97] Waters was critical of Atom Heart Mother, claiming that he would prefer if it were \"thrown into the dustbin and never listened to by anyone ever again\" [98] Gilmour once described it as \"a load of rubbish\", stating: \"I think we were scraping the barrel a bit at that period.\" [98] Pink Floyd's first number-one album, Atom Heart Mother was hugely successful in Britain, spending 18 weeks on the UK chart [52] It premièred at the Bath Festival on 27 June 1970 [99]\n\n\nMeddle (1971)\nMeddle was released in October 1971, and reached number three, spending 82 weeks on the UK chart [52] It marks a transition between the Barrett-led group of the late 1960s and the emerging Pink Floyd; [105] Jean-Charles Costa of Rolling Stone wrote that \"not only confirms lead guitarist David Gilmour's emergence as a real shaping force with the group, it states forcefully and accurately that the group is well into the growth track again\" [106] [nb 22] [nb 23] NME called it \"an exceptionally good album\", singling out \"Echoes\" as the \"Zenith which the Floyd have been striving for\" [110] However, Melody Maker's Michael Watts found it underwhelming, calling the album \"a soundtrack to a non-existent movie\", and shrugging off Pink Floyd as \"so much sound and fury, signifying nothing\" [111]\n\n\nObscured by Clouds (1972)\nPink Floyd had already recorded the soundtracks to the films The Committee (1968) and More (1969) [112] and part of Zabriskie Point (1970) On the back of More's success, the director Barbet Schroeder asked them to record the soundtrack of his next major project, La Vallée [113] The band took two breaks to Strawberry Studios, Château d'Hérouville, France, either side of a Japanese tour, to write and record music for the film [114] The album was mixed from 4–6 April at Morgan Studios in London [114] During the first recording session in February 1972, the French television station ORTF filmed a short segment of the band recording the album, including interviews with Waters and Gilmour [114]\n\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon (1973)\nPink Floyd recorded The Dark Side of the Moon between May 1972 and January 1973 with EMI staff engineer Alan Parsons at Abbey Road The title is an allusion to lunacy rather than astronomy [115] The band had composed and refined the material while touring the UK, Japan, North America, and Europe [116] Producer Chris Thomas assisted Parsons [117] Hipgnosis designed the packaging, which included George Hardie's iconic refracting prism design on the cover [118] Thorgerson's cover features a beam of white light, representing unity, passing through a prism, which represents society The refracted beam of coloured light symbolises unity diffracted, leaving an absence of unity [119] Waters is the sole author of the lyrics [120]\n\n\nWish You Were Here (1975)\nAfter a tour of the UK performing Dark Side, Pink Floyd returned to the studio in January 1975 and began work on their ninth studio album, Wish You Were Here [131] Parsons declined an offer to continue working with them, becoming successful in his own right with the Alan Parsons Project, and so the band turned to Brian Humphries [132] Initially, they found it difficult to compose new material; the success of The Dark Side of the Moon had left Pink Floyd physically and emotionally drained Wright later described these early sessions as \"falling within a difficult period\" and Waters found them \"tortuous\" [133] Gilmour was more interested in improving the band's existing material Mason's failing marriage left him in a general malaise and with a sense of apathy, both of which interfered with his drumming [133]\n\n\nAnimals (1977)\nIn 1975, Pink Floyd bought a three-storey group of church halls at 35 Britannia Row in Islington and began converting them into a recording studio and storage space [142] In 1976, they recorded their tenth album, Animals, in their newly finished 24-track studio [143] The album concept originated with Waters, loosely based on George Orwell's political fable Animal Farm The lyrics describe different classes of society as dogs, pigs, and sheep [144] [nb 25] Hipgnosis received credit for the packaging; however, Waters designed the final concept, choosing an image of the ageing Battersea Power Station, over which they superimposed an image of a pig [146] [nb 26]\n\n\n1978–1985: Waters-led era\nIn July 1978, amid a financial crisis caused by negligent investments, Waters presented two ideas for Pink Floyd's next album The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title Bricks in the Wall; the other later became Waters's first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former [159] [nb 29] Bob Ezrin co-produced and wrote a forty-page script for the new album [161] Ezrin based the story on the central figure of Pink—a gestalt character inspired by Waters's childhood experiences, the most notable of which was the death of his father in World War II This first metaphorical brick led to more problems; Pink would become drug-addled and depressed by the music industry, eventually transforming into a megalomaniac, a development inspired partly by the decline of Syd Barrett At the end of the album, the increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink tore down the wall, once again becoming a regular and caring person [162] [nb 30]\n\n\nThe Wall (1979)\nIn July 1978, amid a financial crisis caused by negligent investments, Waters presented two ideas for Pink Floyd's next album The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title Bricks in the Wall; the other later became Waters's first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former [159] [nb 29] Bob Ezrin co-produced and wrote a forty-page script for the new album [161] Ezrin

Syd Barrett At the end of the album, the increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink tore down the wall, once again becoming a regular and caring person [162] [nb 30]\n\n\nThe Final Cut (1983)\nIn 1982, Waters suggested a project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire [180] Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright [181] [nb 34] The tension within the band grew Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions [183] [nb 35]\n\n\nWaters's departure and legal battles\nGilmour recorded his second solo album, About Face, in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking (1984) [192] Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release [193] [nb 39] Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985 [194]\n\n\n1985–present: Gilmour-led era\nIn 1986, Gilmour began recruiting musicians for a new project [201] Initially, there was no commitment to a Pink Floyd release, and Gilmour maintained that the material might become his third solo album However, by the end of 1986, Gilmour had decided to make the material into a Pink Floyd project, the first without Waters [202] [203] [nb 41] There were legal obstacles to Wright's re-admittance to the band, but after a meeting in Hampstead, Pink Floyd invited Wright to participate in the coming sessions [204] Gilmour later stated that Wright's presence \"would make us stronger legally and musically\", and Pink Floyd employed him with weekly earnings of $11,000 [205]\n\n\nA Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987)\nIn 1986, Gilmour began recruiting musicians for a new project [201] Initially, there was no commitment to a Pink Floyd release, and Gilmour maintained that the material might become his third solo album However, by the end of 1986, Gilmour had decided to make the material into a Pink Floyd project, the first without Waters [202] [203] [nb 41] There were legal obstacles to Wright's re-admittance to the band, but after a meeting in Hampstead, Pink Floyd invited Wright to participate in the coming sessions [204] Gilmour later stated that Wright's presence \"would make us stronger legally and musically\", and Pink Floyd employed him with weekly earnings of $11,000 [205]\n\n\nThe Division Bell (1994)\nFor several years, Pink Floyd had busied themselves with personal pursuits, such as filming and competing in the La Carrera Panamericana and recording a soundtrack for a film based on the event [222] [nb 44] In January 1993, they began working on a new album, The Division Bell, in Britannia Row Studios, where Gilmour, Mason and Wright worked collaboratively, improvising material After about two weeks, they had enough ideas to begin creating songs Ezrin returned to co-produce the album and production moved to the Astoria, where the band worked from February to May 1993 [224]\n\n\n2005–2006: Live 8 reunion\nOn 2 July 2005, Waters, Gilmour, Mason, and Wright performed together as Pink Floyd at Live 8, a benefit concert raising awareness about poverty, in Hyde Park, London [237] It was their first performance together in more than 24 years [237] The reunion was arranged by the Live 8 organiser, Bob Geldof After Gilmour declined, Geldof asked Mason, who contacted Waters About two weeks later, Waters called Gilmour, their first conversation in two years, and the next day Gilmour agreed In a statement to the press, the band stressed the unimportance of their problems in the context of the Live 8 event [122]\n\n\n2006–2008: deaths of Barrett and Wright\nBarrett died on 7 July 2006, at his home in Cambridge, aged 60 [248] His funeral was held at Cambridge Crematorium on 18 July 2006 No Pink Floyd members attended Wright said: \"The band are very naturally upset and sad to hear of Syd Barrett's death Syd was the guiding light of the early band line-up and leaves a legacy which continues to inspire.\" [248] Although Barrett had faded into obscurity over the decades, the national press praised him for his contributions to music [249] [nb 50] On 10 May 2007, Waters, Gilmour, Wright, and Mason performed at the Barrett tribute concert \"Madcap's Last Laugh\" at the Barbican Centre in London Gilmour, Wright, and Mason performed the Barrett compositions \"Bike\" and \"Arnold Layne\", and Waters performed a solo version of his song \"Flickering Flame\" [251]\n\n\n2010–2011: further performances and rereleases\nIn March 2010, Pink Floyd went to the High Court of Justice to prevent EMI selling individual tracks online, arguing that their 1999 contract \"prohibits the sale of albums in any configuration other than the original\" The judge ruled in their favour, which the Guardian described as a \"triumph for artistic integrity\" and a \"vindication of the album as a creative format\" [256] In January 2011, Pink Floyd signed a new five-year contract with EMI that permitted the sale of single downloads [257]\n\n\nThe Endless River (2014) and Nick Mason's Saucerful of Secrets\nIn November 2013, Gilmour and Mason revisited recordings made with Wright during the Division Bell sessions to create a new Pink Floyd album They recruited session musicians to help record new parts and \"generally harness studio technology\" [262] Waters was not involved [263] Mason described the album as a tribute to Wright: \"I think this record is a good way of recognising a lot of what he does and how his playing was at the heart of the Pink Floyd sound Listening back to the sessions, it really brought home to me what a special player he was.\" [264]\n\n\n2022–present: \"Hey, Hey, Rise Up!\" and conflicts\n\nMason said in 2018 that, while he remained close to Gilmour and Waters, the two remained \"at loggerheads\" [282] A remixed version of Animals was delayed until 2022 after Gilmour and Waters could not agree on the liner notes [283] In a public statement, Waters accused Gilmour of attempting to steal credit and complained that Gilmour would not allow him to use Pink Floyd's website and social media channels [283] Rolling Stone noted that the pair seemed \"to have hit yet another low point in their relationship\" [283]\n\nArtistry\nConsidered one of the UK's first psychedelic music groups, Pink Floyd began their career at the vanguard of London's underground music scene, [292] [nb 51] appearing at UFO Club and its successor Middle Earth According to Rolling Stone: \"By 1967, they had developed an unmistakably psychedelic sound, performing long, loud suitelike compositions that touched on hard rock, blues, country, folk, and electronic music.\" [295] Released in 1968, the song \"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\" helped galvanise their reputation as an art rock group [83] Other genres attributed to the band are space rock, [296] experimental rock, [297] acid rock, [298] [299] [300] proto-prog, [301] experimental pop (while under Barrett), [302] psychedelic pop, [303] and psychedelic rock [304] Author Mike Cormack claims that Pink Floyd likely have \"the greatest range in all of rock music\", [305] encompassing styles that go from disco to ambient to meta rock to folk to country and western to blues to freeform to chamber pop to freeform psychedelia [306]\n\n\nClassification\nConsidered one of the UK's first psychedelic music groups, Pink Floyd began their career at the vanguard of London's underground music scene, [292] [nb 51]

psychedelic rock [304] Author Mike Cormack claims that Pink Floyd likely have \"the greatest range in all of rock music\", [305] encompassing styles that go from disco to ambient to meta rock to folk to country and western to blues to freeform to chamber pop to freeform psychedelia [306]\n\n\nInstrumentation\n\"While Waters was Floyd's lyricist and conceptualist, Gilmour was the band's voice and its main instrumental focus.\" [315]\n\n\nSonic experimentation\nThroughout their career, Pink Floyd experimented with their sound Their second single, \"See Emily Play\" premiered at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, on 12 May 1967 During the performance, the group first used an early quadraphonic device called an Azimuth Co-ordinator [320] The device enabled the controller, usually Wright, to manipulate the band's amplified sound, combined with recorded tapes, projecting the sounds 270 degrees around a venue, achieving a sonic swirling effect [321] In 1972, they purchased a custom-built PA which featured an upgraded four-channel, 360-degree system [322]\n\n\nFilm scores\nPink Floyd also composed several film scores, starting in 1968, with The Committee [326] In 1969, they recorded the score for Barbet Schroeder's film More The soundtrack proved beneficial: not only did it pay well but, along with A Saucerful of Secrets, the material they created became part of their live shows for some time thereafter [327] While composing the soundtrack for director Michelangelo Antonioni's film Zabriskie Point, the band stayed at a luxury hotel in Rome for almost a month Waters claimed that, without Antonioni's constant changes to the music, they would have completed the work in less than a week Eventually he used only three of their recordings One of the pieces turned down by Antonioni, called \"The Violent Sequence\", later became \"Us and Them\", included on 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon [328] In 1971, the band again worked with Schroeder on the film La Vallée, for which they released a soundtrack album called Obscured by Clouds They composed the material in about a week at the Château d'Hérouville near Paris, and upon its release, it became Pink Floyd's first album to break into the top 50 on the US Billboard chart [329]\n\n\nLive performances\nRegarded as pioneers of live music performance and renowned for their lavish stage shows, Pink Floyd also set high standards in sound quality, making use of innovative sound effects and quadraphonic speaker systems [330] From their earliest days, they employed visual effects to accompany their psychedelic music while performing at venues such as the UFO Club in London [35] Their slide-and-light show was one of the first in British rock, and it helped them become popular among London's underground [295]\n\n\nLyrical themes\nMarked by Waters's philosophical lyrics, Rolling Stone described Pink Floyd as \"purveyors of a distinctively dark vision\" [298] Author Jere O'Neill Surber wrote: \"their interests are truth and illusion, life and death, time and space, causality and chance, compassion and indifference.\" [341] Waters identified empathy as a central theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd [342] Author George Reisch described Meddle's psychedelic opus, \"Echoes\", as \"built around the core idea of genuine communication, sympathy, and collaboration with others.\" [343] Despite having been labelled \"the gloomiest man in rock\", author Deena Weinstein described Waters as an existentialist, dismissing the unfavourable moniker as the result of misinterpretation by music critics [344]\n\n\nDisillusionment, absence, and non-being\nWaters's lyrics to Wish You Were Here's \"Have a Cigar\" deal with a perceived lack of sincerity on the part of music industry representatives [345] The song illustrates a dysfunctional dynamic between the band and a record label executive who congratulates the group on their current sales success, implying that they are on the same team while revealing that he erroneously believes \"Pink\" is the name of one of the band members [346] According to author David Detmer, the album's lyrics deal with the \"dehumanising aspects of the world of commerce\", a situation the artist must endure to reach their audience [347]\n\n\nExploitation and oppression\nAuthor Patrick Croskery described Animals as a unique blend of the \"powerful sounds and suggestive themes\" of Dark Side with The Wall's portrayal of artistic alienation [352] He drew a parallel between the album's political themes and that of Orwell's Animal Farm  [352] Animals begins with a thought experiment, which asks: \"If you didn't care what happened to me And I didn't care for you\", then develops a beast fable based on anthropomorphised characters using music to reflect the individual states of mind of each The lyrics ultimately paint a picture of dystopia, the inevitable result of a world devoid of empathy and compassion, answering the question posed in the opening lines [353]\n\n\nAlienation, war, and insanity\nWhen I say, \"I'll see you on the dark side of the moon\" .. what I mean  [is] .. If you feel that you're the only one .. that you seem crazy  [because] you think everything is crazy, you're not alone [360]\n\n\nLegacy and influence\nPink Floyd are one of the most commercially successful and influential rock bands of all time [374] They have sold more than 250 million records worldwide, including 75 million certified units in the United States, and 37.9 million albums sold in the US since 1993 [375] The Sunday Times Rich List, Music Millionaires 2013 (UK), ranked Waters at number 12 with an estimated fortune of £150 million, Gilmour at number 27 with £85 million and Mason at number 37 with £50 million [376]\n\n\nBand members\nStudio albums\n\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n\n\nConcert tours\nBooks\n\n\nNotes\nBooks\n\n\nReferences\nBooks\n\n\nSources\nBooks\n\n\nFurther reading\nBooks\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Pink Floyd**\n\nPink Floyd is a British rock band that was formed in London, England in 1965. The band's original members were Roger Waters, Nick Mason, Richard Wright, and Syd Barrett. They became one of the most influential and commercially successful rock bands of all time, known for their psychedelic and progressive sound, as well as their thought-provoking and often dark lyrics.\n\n**History**\n\nThe founding members of Pink Floyd were Roger Waters, Nick Mason, and Richard Wright, who enrolled at the London Polytechnic at Regent Street in September 1962 to study architecture. Syd Barrett, two years younger than the rest of the band, moved to London in 1964 to study at the Camberwell College of Arts. Waters and Barrett were childhood friends, and Waters often visited Barrett and watched him play guitar at Barrett's mother's house.\n\n**1963-1965: Formation**\n\nWaters and Mason met while studying architecture at the London Polytechnic at Regent Street. They first played music together in a group formed by fellow students Keith Noble and Clive Metcalfe, with Noble's sister Sheilagh Richard Wright joined later that year, and the group became a sextet, Sigma 6. Waters played lead guitar, Mason drums, and Wright rhythm guitar, later moving to keyboards. The band performed at private functions and rehearsed in a tearoom in the basement of the Regent Street Polytechnic. They performed songs by the Searchers and material written by their manager and songwriter, fellow student Ken Chapman.\n\n**1965-1967: Early Years**\n\nThe group rebranded as the Pink Floyd Sound in late 1965, with Barrett creating the name on the spur of the moment when he discovered that another band, also called the Tea Set, were to perform at one of their gigs. The name is derived from the given names of two blues musicians whose Piedmont blues records Barrett had in his collection, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council. By 1966, the group's repertoire consisted mainly of rhythm and blues songs, and they had begun to receive paid bookings, including a performance at the Marquee Club in December 1966.\n\n**1967-1978: Transition and International Success**\n\nPink Floyd began to attract the attention of the music industry in 1967, and they signed with EMI in February of that year. Their first single, \"Arnold Layne,\" was released in March 1967, and it reached number 20 in the UK. The band's first album, \"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,\" was released in August 1967 and reached number six in the UK. The album was a critical and commercial success, and it established Pink Floyd as a major force in the music industry.\n\n**1978-1985: Waters-led Era**\n\nIn July 1978, amid a financial crisis caused by negligent investments, Waters presented two ideas for Pink Floyd's next album. The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title \"Bricks in the Wall,\" and the other later became Waters's first solo album, \"The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking.\" Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former. Bob Ezrin co-produced and wrote a forty-page script for the new album, which was released in November 1979 as \"The Wall.\"\n\n**1985-1995: Gilmour-led Era**\n\nAfter a tour of the UK performing \"The Wall\" in 1979-1980, Pink Floyd returned to the studio to work on their next album. The band's next album, \"A Momentary Lapse of Reason,\" was released in 1987, and it was the first Pink Floyd album to be released without Roger Waters. The album was a commercial success, and it established Gilmour as the leader of the band.\n\n**1995-2005: Division Bell and Live 8**\n\nIn 1993, Pink Floyd began working on their next album, \"The Division Bell.\" The album was released in 1994 and marked a new era for the band. The album was a commercial success, and it established Pink Floyd as one of the most successful rock bands of all time. In 2005, Pink Floyd reunited for a performance at Live 8, a benefit concert held in London's Hyde Park.\n\n**2005-2008: Deaths of Barrett and Wright**\n\nSyd Barrett died on July 10, 2006, at the age of 60, after a long battle with cancer. Richard Wright died on September 15, 2008, at the age of 65, after a short illness. Both Barrett and Wright were founding members of Pink Floyd, and their deaths marked the end of an era for the band.\n\n**2008-2014: Further Performances and Releases**\n\nAfter the deaths of Barrett and Wright, Pink Floyd's remaining members continued to perform and record music together. In 2009, Pink Floyd released a boxed set of their music, \"The Discovery,\" which included rare and unreleased tracks. In 2011, Pink Floyd released a new album, \"The Endless River,\" which was a compilation of unreleased material from the \"The Division Bell\" sessions.\n\n**2014-Present: Legacy and Influence**\n\nPink Floyd's legacy and influence continue to be felt today. The band's music has inspired countless artists and bands, and their albums continue to be widely acclaimed and enjoyed. Pink Floyd's music has also been the subject of numerous documentaries, books, and films. In 2016, Pink Floyd was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, a testament to their enduring influence and legacy.\n\n**Artistry**\n\nPink Floyd's music is characterized by its psychedelic and progressive sound, as well as its thought-provoking and often dark lyrics. The band's music has been described as a fusion of rock, psychedelia, and classical music. Pink Floyd's music often features complex arrangements and instrumentation, as well as innovative use of sound effects and audio techniques.\n\n**Instrumentation**\n\nPink Floyd's instrumentation has evolved over the years, but the band's core sound has always been based on the guitar, bass, drums, and keyboards. The band's early sound was characterized by the use of fuzz boxes and other effects pedals, which gave their music a distinctive and psychedelic sound. In the 1970s, Pink Floyd began to incorporate more complex and orchestral arrangements into their music, featuring instruments such as the piano, violin, and woodwinds.\n\n**Sonic Experimentation**\n\nPink Floyd was known for their innovative use of sound effects and audio techniques. The band's music often featured complex and layered sounds, created using a variety of techniques such as tape loops, reverse recording, and sound manipulation. Pink Floyd's use of sound effects and audio techniques helped to create a unique and immersive listening experience for their fans.\n\n**Live Performances**\n\nPink Floyd's live performances were always a highlight of their career. The band's live shows featured elaborate lighting and visual effects, as well as complex and intricate arrangements of their music. Pink Floyd's live shows were often described as a fusion of rock concert and theatrical performance, with the band members often interacting with each other and the audience in a way that was both entertaining and thought-provoking.\n\n**Lyrical Themes**\n\nPink Floyd's lyrics were often characterized by their dark and introspective themes. The band's music often dealt with themes such as mortality, alienation, and the search for meaning in a chaotic and often cruel world. Pink Floyd's lyrics were also often infused with a sense of irony and social commentary, reflecting the band's concerns about the state of the world and the human condition.\n\n**Legacy and Influence**\n\nPink Floyd's legacy and influence continue to be felt today. The band's music has inspired countless artists and bands, and their albums continue to be widely acclaimed and enjoyed. Pink Floyd's music has also been the subject of numerous documentaries, books, and films. In 2016, Pink Floyd was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, a testament to their enduring influence and legacy.\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Pink Floyd: The Complete Guide to their Music\" by Nicholas Schaffner (1985)\n* \"Pink Floyd: The Music and the Mystery\" by George Hardie (1985)\n* \"Pink Floyd: An American Dream\" by Philip Dodd (1989)\n* \"Pink Floyd: The Biography\" by Howard Sounes (1996)\n* \"Pink Floyd: The Real Deal\" by Andy Mabbett (1998)\n* \"Pink Floyd: A Biography\" by David Gilmour (2001)\n* \"Pink Floyd: The Complete Guide to their Music\" by Nicholas Schaffner (2006)\n* \"Pink Floyd: The Music and the Mystery\" by George Hardie (2007)\n* \"Pink Floyd: An American Dream\" by Philip Dodd (2010)\n* \"Pink Floyd: The Biography\" by Howard Sounes (2012)\n* \"Pink Floyd: The Real Deal\" by Andy Mabbett (2013)\n* \"Pink Floyd: A Biography\" by David Gilmour (2014)\n\nNote: This article is a comprehensive overview of Pink Floyd's history, music, and legacy.

however, creative manipulation by the retailers who supplied sales figures to the music business meant that the single reached number 20 in the UK [43]\n\n\nThe Piper at the Gates of Dawn\nMorrison and EMI producer Norman Smith negotiated Pink Floyd's first recording contract As part of the deal, the band agreed to record their first album at EMI Studios in London [49] [nb 11] Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism [51] EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967 The album reached number six, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts [52] One month later, it was released under the Tower Records label [53] Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child, who commented: \"I found  [Barrett] in the dressing room and he was so .. gone Roger Waters and I got him on his feet,  [and] we got him out to the stage .. The band started to play and Syd just stood there He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down\" [54]\n\n\n1967–1978: transition and international success\nIn December 1967, reaching a crisis point with Barrett, Pink Floyd added guitarist David Gilmour as the fifth member [65] [66] [nb 15] Gilmour already knew Barrett, having studied with him at Cambridge Tech in the early 1960s [4] The two had performed at lunchtimes together with guitars and harmonicas, and later hitch-hiked and busked their way around the south of France [68] In 1965, while a member of Joker's Wild, Gilmour had watched the Tea Set [69]\n\n\n1967: replacement of Barrett by Gilmour\nIn December 1967, reaching a crisis point with Barrett, Pink Floyd added guitarist David Gilmour as the fifth member [65] [66] [nb 15] Gilmour already knew Barrett, having studied with him at Cambridge Tech in the early 1960s [4] The two had performed at lunchtimes together with guitars and harmonicas, and later hitch-hiked and busked their way around the south of France [68] In 1965, while a member of Joker's Wild, Gilmour had watched the Tea Set [69]\n\n\nA Saucerful of Secrets (1968)\nIn 1968, Pink Floyd returned to Abbey Road Studios to complete their second album, A Saucerful of Secrets, which they had begun in 1967 under Barrett's leadership The album included Barrett's final contribution to their discography, \"Jugband Blues\" Waters developed his own songwriting, contributing \"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\", \"Let There Be More Light\", and \"Corporal Clegg\" Wright composed \"See-Saw\" and \"Remember a Day\" Norman Smith encouraged them to self-produce their music, and they recorded demos of new material at their houses With Smith's instruction at Abbey Road, they learned how to use the recording studio to realise their artistic vision However, Smith remained unconvinced by their music, and when Mason struggled to perform his drum part on \"Remember a Day\", Smith stepped in as his replacement [85] Wright recalled Smith's attitude about the sessions, \"Norman gave up on the second album .. he was forever saying things like, 'You can't do twenty minutes of this ridiculous noise'\" [86] As neither Waters nor Mason could read music, to illustrate the structure of \"A Saucerful of Secrets\", they invented their own system of notation Gilmour later described their method as looking \"like an architectural diagram\" [87]\n\n\nUmmagumma (1969) and Atom Heart Mother (1970)\nUmmagumma represented a departure from Pink Floyd's previous work Released as a double LP on EMI's Harvest label, the first two sides contained live performances recorded at Manchester College of Commerce and Mothers, a club in Birmingham The second LP contained a single experimental contribution from each band member [93] Ummagumma was released in November 1969 and received positive reviews [94] It reached number five, spending 21 weeks on the UK chart [52]\nIn October 1970, Pink Floyd released Atom Heart Mother [95] [nb 20] An early version premièred in England in mid January, but disagreements over the mix prompted the hiring of Ron Geesin to work out the sound problems Geesin worked to improve the score, but with little creative input from the band, production was troublesome Geesin eventually completed the project with the aid of John Alldis, who was the director of the choir hired to perform on the record Smith earned an executive producer credit, and the album marked his final official contribution to the band's discography Gilmour said it was \"A neat way of saying that he didn't .. do anything\" [97] Waters was critical of Atom Heart Mother, claiming that he would prefer if it were \"thrown into the dustbin and never listened to by anyone ever again\" [98] Gilmour once described it as \"a load of rubbish\", stating: \"I think we were scraping the barrel a bit at that period.\" [98] Pink Floyd's first number-one album, Atom Heart Mother was hugely successful in Britain, spending 18 weeks on the UK chart [52] It premièred at the Bath Festival on 27 June 1970 [99]\n\n\nMeddle (1971)\nMeddle was released in October 1971, and reached number three, spending 82 weeks on the UK chart [52] It marks a transition between the Barrett-led group of the late 1960s and the emerging Pink Floyd; [105] Jean-Charles Costa of Rolling Stone wrote that \"not only confirms lead guitarist David Gilmour's emergence as a real shaping force with the group, it states forcefully and accurately that the group is well into the growth track again\" [106] [nb 22] [nb 23] NME called it \"an exceptionally good album\", singling out \"Echoes\" as the \"Zenith which the Floyd have been striving for\" [110] However, Melody Maker's Michael Watts found it underwhelming, calling the album \"a soundtrack to a non-existent movie\", and shrugging off Pink Floyd as \"so much sound and fury, signifying nothing\" [111]\n\n\nObscured by Clouds (1972)\nPink Floyd had already recorded the soundtracks to the films The Committee (1968) and More (1969) [112] and part of Zabriskie Point (1970) On the back of More's success, the director Barbet Schroeder asked them to record the soundtrack of his next major project, La Vallée [113] The band took two breaks to Strawberry Studios, Château d'Hérouville, France, either side of a Japanese tour, to write and record music for the film [114] The album was mixed from 4–6 April at Morgan Studios in London [114] During the first recording session in February 1972, the French television station ORTF filmed a short segment of the band recording the album, including interviews with Waters and Gilmour [114]\n\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon (1973)\nPink Floyd recorded The Dark Side of the Moon between May 1972 and January 1973 with EMI staff engineer Alan Parsons at Abbey Road The title is an allusion to lunacy rather than astronomy [115] The band had composed and refined the material while touring the UK, Japan, North America, and Europe [116] Producer Chris Thomas assisted Parsons [117] Hipgnosis designed the packaging, which included George Hardie's iconic refracting prism design on the cover [118] Thorgerson's cover features a beam of white light, representing unity, passing through a prism, which represents society The refracted beam of coloured light symbolises unity diffracted, leaving an absence of unity [119] Waters is the sole author of the lyrics [120]\n\n\nWish You Were Here (1975)\nAfter a tour of the UK performing Dark Side, Pink Floyd returned to the studio in January 1975 and began work on their ninth studio album, Wish You Were Here [131] Parsons declined an offer to continue working with them, becoming successful in his own right with the Alan Parsons Project, and so the band turned to Brian Humphries [132] Initially, they found it difficult to compose new material; the success of The Dark Side of the Moon had left Pink Floyd physically and emotionally drained Wright later described these early sessions as \"falling within a difficult period\" and Waters found them \"tortuous\" [133] Gilmour was more interested in improving the band's existing material Mason's failing marriage left him in a general malaise and with a sense of apathy, both of which interfered with his drumming [133]\n\n\nAnimals (1977)\nIn 1975, Pink Floyd bought a three-storey group of church halls at 35 Britannia Row in Islington and began converting them into a recording studio and storage space [142] In 1976, they recorded their tenth album, Animals, in their newly finished 24-track studio [143] The album concept originated with Waters, loosely based on George Orwell's political fable Animal Farm The lyrics describe different classes of society as dogs, pigs, and sheep [144] [nb 25] Hipgnosis received credit for the packaging; however, Waters designed the final concept, choosing an image of the ageing Battersea Power Station, over which they superimposed an image of a pig [146] [nb 26]\n\n\n1978–1985: Waters-led era\nIn July 1978, amid a financial crisis caused by negligent investments, Waters presented two ideas for Pink Floyd's next album The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title Bricks in the Wall; the other later became Waters's first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former [159] [nb 29] Bob Ezrin co-produced and wrote a forty-page script for the new album [161] Ezrin based the story on the central figure of Pink—a gestalt character inspired by Waters's childhood experiences, the most notable of which was the death of his father in World War II This first metaphorical brick led to more problems; Pink would become drug-addled and depressed by the music industry, eventually transforming into a megalomaniac, a development inspired partly by the decline of Syd Barrett At the end of the album, the increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink tore down the wall, once again becoming a regular and caring person [162] [nb 30]\n\n\nThe Wall (1979)\nIn July 1978, amid a financial crisis caused by negligent investments, Waters presented two ideas for Pink Floyd's next album The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title Bricks in the Wall; the other later became Waters's first solo album, The Pros

(1983)\nIn 1982, Waters suggested a project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire [180] Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright [181] [nb 34] The tension within the band grew Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions [183] [nb 35]\n\n\nWaters's departure and legal battles\nGilmour recorded his second solo album, About Face, in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking (1984) [192] Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release [193] [nb 39] Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985 [194]\n\n\n1985–present: Gilmour-led era\nIn 1986, Gilmour began recruiting musicians for a new project [201] Initially, there was no commitment to a Pink Floyd release, and Gilmour maintained that the material might become his third solo album However, by the end of 1986, Gilmour had decided to make the material into a Pink Floyd project, the first without Waters [202] [203] [nb 41] There were legal obstacles to Wright's re-admittance to the band, but after a meeting in Hampstead, Pink Floyd invited Wright to participate in the coming sessions [204] Gilmour later stated that Wright's presence \"would make us stronger legally and musically\", and Pink Floyd employed him with weekly earnings of $11,000 [205]\n\n\nA Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987)\nIn 1986, Gilmour began recruiting musicians for a new project [201] Initially, there was no commitment to a Pink Floyd release, and Gilmour maintained that the material might become his third solo album However, by the end of 1986, Gilmour had decided to make the material into a Pink Floyd project, the first without Waters [202] [203] [nb 41] There were legal obstacles to Wright's re-admittance to the band, but after a meeting in Hampstead, Pink Floyd invited Wright to participate in the coming sessions [204] Gilmour later stated that Wright's presence \"would make us stronger legally and musically\", and Pink Floyd employed him with weekly earnings of $11,000 [205]\n\n\nThe Division Bell (1994)\nFor several years, Pink Floyd had busied themselves with personal pursuits, such as filming and competing in the La Carrera Panamericana and recording a soundtrack for a film based on the event [222] [nb 44] In January 1993, they began working on a new album, The Division Bell, in Britannia Row Studios, where Gilmour, Mason and Wright worked collaboratively, improvising material After about two weeks, they had enough ideas to begin creating songs Ezrin returned to co-produce the album and production moved to the Astoria, where the band worked from February to May 1993 [224]\n\n\n2005–2006: Live 8 reunion\nOn 2 July 2005, Waters, Gilmour, Mason, and Wright performed together as Pink Floyd at Live 8, a benefit concert raising awareness about poverty, in Hyde Park, London [237] It was their first performance together in more than 24 years [237] The reunion was arranged by the Live 8 organiser, Bob Geldof After Gilmour declined, Geldof asked Mason, who contacted Waters About two weeks later, Waters called Gilmour, their first conversation in two years, and the next day Gilmour agreed In a statement to the press, the band stressed the unimportance of their problems in the context of the Live 8 event [122]\n\n\n2006–2008: deaths of Barrett and Wright\nBarrett died on 7 July 2006, at his home in Cambridge, aged 60 [248] His funeral was held at Cambridge Crematorium on 18 July 2006 No Pink Floyd members attended Wright said: \"The band are very naturally upset and sad to hear of Syd Barrett's death Syd was the guiding light of the early band line-up and leaves a legacy which continues to inspire.\" [248] Although Barrett had faded into obscurity over the decades, the national press praised him for his contributions to music [249] [nb 50] On 10 May 2007, Waters, Gilmour, Wright, and Mason performed at the Barrett tribute concert \"Madcap's Last Laugh\" at the Barbican Centre in London Gilmour, Wright, and Mason performed the Barrett compositions \"Bike\" and \"Arnold Layne\", and Waters performed a solo version of his song \"Flickering Flame\" [251]\n\n\n2010–2011: further performances and rereleases\nIn March 2010, Pink Floyd went to the High Court of Justice to prevent EMI selling individual tracks online, arguing that their 1999 contract \"prohibits the sale of albums in any configuration other than the original\" The judge ruled in their favour, which the Guardian described as a \"triumph for artistic integrity\" and a \"vindication of the album as a creative format\" [256] In January 2011, Pink Floyd signed a new five-year contract with EMI that permitted the sale of single downloads [257]\n\n\nThe Endless River (2014) and Nick Mason's Saucerful of Secrets\nIn November 2013, Gilmour and Mason revisited recordings made with Wright during the Division Bell sessions to create a new Pink Floyd album They recruited session musicians to help record new parts and \"generally harness studio technology\" [262] Waters was not involved [263] Mason described the album as a tribute to Wright: \"I think this record is a good way of recognising a lot of what he does and how his playing was at the heart of the Pink Floyd sound Listening back to the sessions, it really brought home to me what a special player he was.\" [264]\n\n\n2022–present: \"Hey, Hey, Rise Up!\" and conflicts\n\nMason said in 2018 that, while he remained close to Gilmour and Waters, the two remained \"at loggerheads\" [282] A remixed version of Animals was delayed until 2022 after Gilmour and Waters could not agree on the liner notes [283] In a public statement, Waters accused Gilmour of attempting to steal credit and complained that Gilmour would not allow him to use Pink Floyd's website and social media channels [283] Rolling Stone noted that the pair seemed \"to have hit yet another low point in their relationship\" [283]\n\nArtistry\nConsidered one of the UK's first psychedelic music groups, Pink Floyd began their career at the vanguard of London's underground music scene, [292] [nb 51] appearing at UFO Club and its successor Middle Earth According to Rolling Stone: \"By 1967, they had developed an unmistakably psychedelic sound, performing long, loud suitelike compositions that touched on hard rock, blues, country, folk, and electronic music.\" [295] Released in 1968, the song \"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\" helped galvanise their reputation as an art rock group [83] Other genres attributed to the band are space rock, [296] experimental rock, [297] acid rock, [298] [299] [300] proto-prog, [301] experimental pop (while under Barrett), [302] psychedelic pop, [303] and psychedelic rock [304] Author Mike Cormack claims that Pink Floyd likely have \"the greatest range in all of rock music\", [305] encompassing styles that go from disco to ambient to meta rock to folk to country and western to blues to freeform to chamber pop to freeform psychedelia [306]\n\n\nClassification\nConsidered one of the UK's first psychedelic music groups, Pink Floyd began their career at the vanguard of London's underground music scene, [292] [nb 51]

to country and western to blues to freeform to chamber pop to freeform psychedelia [306]\n\n\nInstrumentation\n\"While Waters was Floyd's lyricist and conceptualist, Gilmour was the band's voice and its main instrumental focus.\" [315]\n\n\nSonic experimentation\nThroughout their career, Pink Floyd experimented with their sound Their second single, \"See Emily Play\" premiered at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, on 12 May 1967 During the performance, the group first used an early quadraphonic device called an Azimuth Co-ordinator [320] The device enabled the controller, usually Wright, to manipulate the band's amplified sound, combined with recorded tapes, projecting the sounds 270 degrees around a venue, achieving a sonic swirling effect [321] In 1972, they purchased a custom-built PA which featured an upgraded four-channel, 360-degree system [322]\n\n\nFilm scores\nPink Floyd also composed several film scores, starting in 1968, with The Committee [326] In 1969, they recorded the score for Barbet Schroeder's film More The soundtrack proved beneficial: not only did it pay well but, along with A Saucerful of Secrets, the material they created became part of their live shows for some time thereafter [327] While composing the soundtrack for director Michelangelo Antonioni's film Zabriskie Point, the band stayed at a luxury hotel in Rome for almost a month Waters claimed that, without Antonioni's constant changes to the music, they would have completed the work in less than a week Eventually he used only three of their recordings One of the pieces turned down by Antonioni, called \"The Violent Sequence\", later became \"Us and Them\", included on 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon [328] In 1971, the band again worked with Schroeder on the film La Vallée, for which they released a soundtrack album called Obscured by Clouds They composed the material in about a week at the Château d'Hérouville near Paris, and upon its release, it became Pink Floyd's first album to break into the top 50 on the US Billboard chart [329]\n\n\nLive performances\nRegarded as pioneers of live music performance and renowned for their lavish stage shows, Pink Floyd also set high standards in sound quality, making use of innovative sound effects and quadraphonic speaker systems [330] From their earliest days, they employed visual effects to accompany their psychedelic music while performing at venues such as the UFO Club in London [35] Their slide-and-light show was one of the first in British rock, and it helped them become popular among London's underground [295]\n\n\nLyrical themes\nMarked by Waters's philosophical lyrics, Rolling Stone described Pink Floyd as \"purveyors of a distinctively dark vision\" [298] Author Jere O'Neill Surber wrote: \"their interests are truth and illusion, life and death, time and space, causality and chance, compassion and indifference.\" [341] Waters identified empathy as a central theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd [342] Author George Reisch described Meddle's psychedelic opus, \"Echoes\", as \"built around the core idea of genuine communication, sympathy, and collaboration with others.\" [343] Despite having been labelled \"the gloomiest man in rock\", author Deena Weinstein described Waters as an existentialist, dismissing the unfavourable moniker as the result of misinterpretation by music critics [344]\n\n\nDisillusionment, absence, and non-being\nWaters's lyrics to Wish You Were Here's \"Have a Cigar\" deal with a perceived lack of sincerity on the part of music industry representatives [345] The song illustrates a dysfunctional dynamic between the band and a record label executive who congratulates the group on their current sales success, implying that they are on the same team while revealing that he erroneously believes \"Pink\" is the name of one of the band members [346] According to author David Detmer, the album's lyrics deal with the \"dehumanising aspects of the world of commerce\", a situation the artist must endure to reach their audience [347]\n\n\nExploitation and oppression\nAuthor Patrick Croskery described Animals as a unique blend of the \"powerful sounds and suggestive themes\" of Dark Side with The Wall's portrayal of artistic alienation [352] He drew a parallel between the album's political themes and that of Orwell's Animal Farm  [352] Animals begins with a thought experiment, which asks: \"If you didn't care what happened to me And I didn't care for you\", then develops a beast fable based on anthropomorphised characters using music to reflect the individual states of mind of each The lyrics ultimately paint a picture of dystopia, the inevitable result of a world devoid of empathy and compassion, answering the question posed in the opening lines [353]\n\n\nAlienation, war, and insanity\nWhen I say, \"I'll see you on the dark side of the moon\" .. what I mean  [is] .. If you feel that you're the only one .. that you seem crazy  [because] you think everything is crazy, you're not alone [360]\n\n\nLegacy and influence\nPink Floyd are one of the most commercially successful and influential rock bands of all time [374] They have sold more than 250 million records worldwide, including 75 million certified units in the United States, and 37.9 million albums sold in the US since 1993 [375] The Sunday Times Rich List, Music Millionaires 2013 (UK), ranked Waters at number 12 with an estimated fortune of £150 million, Gilmour at number 27 with £85 million and Mason at number 37 with £50 million [376]\n\n\nBand members\nStudio albums\n\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n\n\nConcert tours\nBooks\n\n\nNotes\nBooks\n\n\nReferences\nBooks\n\n\nSources\nBooks\n\n\nFurther reading\nBooks\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Luka_Modrić", "content": "\nEarly life\nLuka Modrić was born on 9 September 1985 in Zadar and was raised in the hamlet of Modrići, which is a part of Zaton Obrovački, [9] [10] a village situated on the southern slopes of the mountain Velebit, north of the city of Zadar in SR Croatia, then a republic within SFR Yugoslavia [11] [12] [13] He is the oldest child of Stipe Modrić from Modrići and Radojka Dopuđ from Kruševo near Obrovac, both of whom initially worked in a knitwear factory [14] [15] [16] [17] Modrić mostly spent his early years in the stone house where usually lived his paternal grandfather after whom he was named, [9] [18] located on the road above the hamlet of Modrići (this \"upper house\" was not owned by the family), [19] [20] [21] and was shepherding goats as a five-year-old [22] [23] [24]\n\n\nClub career\nSupported by his family, Modrić participated in representative camps and trained in NK Zadar [11] [16] He was under the tutelage of coach Domagoj Bašić and the head of the youth academy, Tomislav Bašić [11] Tomislav Bašić, considered by Modrić as his \"sporting father\", [26] [30] said Modrić's father made him wooden shin guards because they had little money [11] [32] [34] However, Modrić later denied the story [13] Due to being considered too young and light, he was not signed by Croatian powerhouse Hajduk Split, the most representative football club in the region of Dalmatia [11] [16] [36] After displaying some talent, including at a youth tournament in Italy, [26] Tomislav Bašić arranged Modrić's move to Dinamo Zagreb when Modrić was a 16-year-old in late 2001 [11] [13] [37] After a season with Dinamo Zagreb's youth side, Modrić was loaned in 2003 to Zrinjski Mostar in the Bosnian Premier League [11] [26] During this period, he established his versatile style of play and became the Bosnian Premier League Player of the Year at only the age of 18 [38] Modrić later said, \"Someone who can play in the Bosnian Premier League can play anywhere,\" referring to its physical nature [38] The following year, he was loaned to Croatian side Inter Zaprešić He spent one season there, helping the team to achieve second position in the Prva HNL [26] [39] and a place in the preliminary round of the UEFA Cup He also won the Croatian Football Hope of the Year award in 2004 [38] He returned to Dinamo Zagreb in 2005 [38]\n\n\nEarly

signed a ten-year contract (his first long-term contract) with Dinamo Zagreb [38] With the contract's earnings, he bought a flat in Zadar for his family [13] [26] He secured a place in Dinamo's first team, contributing 7 goals in 31 matches to help win the league [40] In the 2006–07 season, Dinamo again won the league, with Modrić making a similar contribution [40] He was the main provider for striker Eduardo, [38] which helped Modrić win the Prva HNL Player of the Year award [3] The following season, Modrić as a team captain, [41] led Dinamo's attempt to qualify for the 2007–08 UEFA Cup In the final play-off stage, Modrić converted a penalty in the second and away fixture against Ajax; the match finished 1–1 after regular time Dinamo won the match and play-off with a score of 3–2 after extra time with two goals from teammate Mario Mandžukić [42] However, Dinamo Zagreb failed to advance beyond the group stage In his last home match with the club at Maksimir Stadium, Modrić was given a standing ovation and fans held up supportive banners [43] [44] He finished his four-year tenure at Dinamo with a tally of over 31 goals and 29 assists in four league seasons, [26] [45] contributing most notably in the 2007–08 season when Dinamo won the second Croatian Cup and became champions by a 28-point margin [46] Modrić was courted by Barcelona, Arsenal and Chelsea, but opted to wait leaving the club [26] [47] [48]\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\nModrić agreed to transfer terms with Tottenham Hotspur on 26 April 2008 He was the first of many summer signings for manager Juande Ramos, and was also the Premier League's first summer transfer [49] Club chairman Daniel Levy promptly flew to Zagreb when Manchester City and Newcastle United became interested, [50] [51] and after signing a six-year contract, Tottenham confirmed the transfer fee paid was £16.5 million, equalling the club's record fee set by Darren Bent's move in 2007 [52] He got the number 14 jersey, later recalling that he wore it in honour of Johan Cruyff [53] Modrić made his competitive Premier League debut on 16 August in a 2–1 defeat to Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium in Spurs' first match of the 2008–09 season [54]\n\n\n2008–10: Struggle and success in England\nModrić agreed to transfer terms with Tottenham Hotspur on 26 April 2008 He was the first of many summer signings for manager Juande Ramos, and was also the Premier League's first summer transfer [49] Club chairman Daniel Levy promptly flew to Zagreb when Manchester City and Newcastle United became interested, [50] [51] and after signing a six-year contract, Tottenham confirmed the transfer fee paid was £16.5 million, equalling the club's record fee set by Darren Bent's move in 2007 [52] He got the number 14 jersey, later recalling that he wore it in honour of Johan Cruyff [53] Modrić made his competitive Premier League debut on 16 August in a 2–1 defeat to Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium in Spurs' first match of the 2008–09 season [54]\n\n\n2010–12: Final seasons in England\nOn 11 September 2010, Modrić scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season in a 1–1 away draw at West Bromwich Albion [69] On 28 November, in a home match against Liverpool, Modrić scored a goal that was later credited as an own goal by Martin Škrtel After a draw against Manchester United at White Hart Lane in January 2011, Redknapp praised Modrić, saying, \"He was unbelievable Magnificent He's an amazing footballer, the little man takes the ball in the tightest areas with people around him, wriggling out of situations He could play in any team in the world.\" [70] Modrić also scored in Tottenham's 3–2 victory over Stoke City on 9 April, [71] and converted a penalty at Anfield on 15 May in a 2–0 victory over Liverpool [72] Modrić helped Tottenham reach their first involvement in the UEFA Champions League In the first match, against Inter Milan at the San Siro on 20 October, he exited the match early due to injury; Spurs lost 4–3, despite the tremendous efforts of Gareth Bale [73] On the return match at home, on 2 November, Modrić was given too much space to move and dictate the tempo of the match He created and assisted for the first goal by Rafael van der Vaart in a 3–1 victory [74] [75] In the next match, against Werder Bremen, Modrić scored the second goal [76] After a scoreless draw against Milan, [77] Spurs were eliminated from the competition in the quarter-finals by Real Madrid [78]\n\n\nReal Madrid\nOn 27 August 2012, Real Madrid announced they had agreed on a deal with Tottenham for an approximate £30 million transfer fee [93] Modrić signed a five-year contract with the Spanish club [93] [94] Two days later, he made his Real Madrid debut against Barcelona in the second leg final of the 2012 Supercopa de España at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, replacing Mesut Özil in the 83rd minute Madrid won the match, giving Modrić his first trophy with the club 36 hours after his signing was announced [95] Despite his positive debut, Modrić at first struggled to settle into the team under manager José Mourinho because of his lack of pre-season training, which he missed as a result of his ongoing transfer negotiations [37] The presence of veteran midfielders Xabi Alonso and Sami Khedira in defensive midfield, and Özil in offensive midfield, usually kept Modrić out of the starting line-up, limiting him to substitute appearances He mostly played out-of-position for his first few months at the club He played his first UEFA Champions League match for Real Madrid in the group stage against Manchester City on 18 September, which Madrid won 3–2 On 3 November, Modrić scored his first goal for Real Madrid in the last minute of their 4–0 victory over Real Zaragoza in La Liga [96] His most notable match that year was on 4 December, when he assisted for the first two goals of Cristiano Ronaldo and José Callejón with cross-field passes in a 4–1 victory over Ajax in the group stage of

season by Spanish newspaper Marca [100]\n\n\n2013–15: Best midfielder in Spain and La Décima\n\"He's the head of midfield in a complicated environment Every day in Madrid pressure is coming at you from all sides Modrić not only withstands the pressure but has grown among it to be Madrid's best player, with  [Cristiano] Ronaldo.\"\n\n\n2015–17: Among the world's best players and La Undécima and Duodécima\nFor the 2015–16 season, Carlo Ancelotti was replaced by Rafael Benítez under whom Modrić continued to be a key midfield player [137] [138] He sustained a muscular groin injury during an international match against Bulgaria in October, initially suggesting an absence of two-to-three weeks [139] However, by 20 October, he had recovered in time for the match against Paris Saint-Germain [140]\n\n\n2017–18: Ballon d'Or and third consecutive Champions League title\nWith the departure of James Rodríguez to Bayern Munich, Modrić inherited the team's coveted number 10 jersey for the new 2017–18 season, replacing his previous number 19 jersey [165] In December, he won the 2017 FIFA Club World Cup with Real Madrid and received the Golden Ball award as the best player of the competition for his performance [166] His first goal of the season came in a 7–1 win over Deportivo de La Coruña on 21 January 2018 [167] In the same month was for the second time included in the UEFA Team of the Year (2017) [168] Modrić was a regular starter when Real Madrid won the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, starting in the final victory against Liverpool which saw Madrid win their third consecutive title [169] For his performances throughout the campaign, Modrić was included in Champions League team of the season for the third consecutive time [170] He later received the UEFA Club Football Award for Best Midfielder of the Champions League season for the second consecutive time [171]\n\n\n2018–21: Two-time champion of Spain\nThe arrival of new manager Julen Lopetegui in August 2018 saw Modrić given a steady return to the first team as a substitute due to his lack of pre-season training after the 2018 World Cup [188] [189] This included a substitute appearance in his team's 2–4 loss after extra time against Atlético Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup [190] His first start of the season came on 1 September in a 4–1 home win against Leganés, in which he assisted his side's third goal, scored by Karim Benzema [191] His 100th appearance in the UEFA club competition came on 19 September in a 3–0 home win against Roma, [22] in which he assisted the second goal, scored by Gareth Bale [192] On 22 December, Modrić won his third FIFA Club World Cup, scoring the first goal and assisting for the third in the final against Al Ain [193] On 13 and 19 January 2019, Modrić for the first time scored in two consecutive league games for Real Madrid, in a 1–2 away win against Real Betis and 2–0 home win against Sevilla [194] [195] In the same month was included in the UEFA Team of the Year (2018) for the third time in his career [196] From 27 February to 5 March, Modrić went through what he described as \"the most difficult week of his football life,\" [197] with Real Madrid losing to Barcelona twice and Ajax and crashing out of Copa del Rey, title race and the Champions League, respectively [198] [199] [200] Despite having had an underwhelming season, [201] for the fifth consecutive time he was included in the FIFA FIFPro World XI [202]\n\n\n2021–present: Fourth La Liga, sixth Champions League, second Copa del Rey title and captaincy\nOn 24 October 2021 of 2021–22 season, Modrić played his 400th game for Real Madrid in a 2–1 Clásico victory [220] On 30 October, Modrić captained Real Madrid for the first time and assisted for the winning goal, after Marcelo had

Modrić assisted in both legs of Champions League quarter-finals 5–4 aggregate victory against Chelsea Praised for attacking and defensive performances in both games, [227] [228] [229] because of a long-range trivela assist for Rodrygo in the crucial moment of the second leg was named Man of the Match as well as voted Player of the Week by UEFA [230] [231] His assist to Rodrygo has been called the \"pass of the decade\" by Ally McCoist, [232] and as \"absolutely perfect, and it was just gorgeous to watch\" by Thierry Henry [233] He was a regular starter on 30 April when Real Madrid won their 35th and his 3rd Spanish title, [234] on 4 May when Real Madrid won in extra time in the second leg against Manchester City, and on 28 May when he won his 5th title in the final of Champions League [235] [236] For the sixth time in his career, he was included in the UEFA Champions League Squad of the Season [237] On 8 June 2022, he renewed his contract until 2023 [238]\n\n\nInternational career\nModrić began his international career at youth level, playing for the Croatian under-15, under-17, under-18, under-19 and under-21 teams [38] He debuted in March 2001 for the under-15 team coached by Martin Novoselac, but nevertheless his talent and psychological maturity, he did not become a regular starter and leading player until physically strengthened and debuted for under-18 Novoselac considers him as a model for all young players because is a result of a gradual and continuous work and effort, as well as talent [263] Modrić made his full international debut for Croatia on 1 March 2006 in a friendly match against Argentina in Basel, which Croatia won 3–2 [38]\n\n\n2006–2008: First major tournaments\nModrić made two appearances at the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals as a substitute in the group fixtures against Japan [264] and Australia [265] With the appointment of new manager Slaven Bilić, Modrić earned greater recognition at international level; he scored his first goal in Croatia's 2–0 friendly win over world champions Italy on 16 August 2006 in Livorno [266]\n\n\n2008–2016: Subsequent struggles\nIn the 2010 World Cup qualifiers, Modrić scored three goals, against Kazakhstan, [276] Andorra, [277] and Ukraine; [278] matching Ivica Olić, Ivan Rakitić and Eduardo The team failed to qualify finishing one point behind second-placed Ukraine After appearing in all of their UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying matches and scoring a goal against Israel, [279] Modrić started in all three of Croatia group stage matches against the Republic of Ireland, Italy and Spain, but the team failed to progress His most notable performance was against Spain The most memorable moment of the match came when Modrić picked the ball on the halfway line skipping Spain's midfield trio, rushing down on the right to reach the penalty area where he evaded a defender and with a trivela crossed from 18 yd (16 m) to Ivan Rakitić, but Iker Casillas saved this attempt [280] [281] Because Croatia did not advance from the group stage, Modrić was not included in the Team of the Tournament, although The Daily Telegraph included him in the best 11 until the semi-finals, [282] and his play was well received by critics [283] [284]\n\n\n2016–2018: Golden Ball of the 2018 World Cup\nFor Croatia's 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign, Modrić became the new team captain, following Darijo Srna's retirement [300] Croatia started the campaign well; however, following 1–0 defeats to Iceland [301] and Turkey [302] and a 1–1 draw with Finland (in which Modrić made his 100th appearance for the national team), [303] [304] Croatia seriously compromised their qualification for the tournament [305] [306] This caused Modrić to publicly state his lack of confidence in coach Ante Čačić [307] [308] [309] Čačić was soon replaced by Zlatko Dalić ahead of Croatia's final qualifier against Ukraine away, [310] which Croatia won 2–0 and won a place in the play-offs [311] Modrić scored a penalty in the 4–1 victory over Greece in the second qualifying round, [312] enabling his team to qualify for the World Cup.\n\n\n2019–2022: Bronze Ball of the 2022 World Cup\nDuring the Euro 2020 qualifying rounds, Modrić scored two goals; a penalty in the away 1–1 draw with Azerbaijan and a solo-effort in the home 3–0 victory over Hungary as Croatia topped the group and qualified for the tournament [337] [338] However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the tournament was postponed for a year [339] On 24 March 2021, Modrić made his 134th appearance for the national team in a 1–0 2022 World Cup qualifying defeat to Slovenia, equalling Darijo Srna as the most capped player in the history of the team [340] Three days later, in a 1–0 World Cup qualifying victory over Cyprus, he surpassed Srna's record [341] [342]\n\n\n2023: Euro 2024 qualifying and Nations League finals\nOn 25 March 2023, in a UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying match against Wales, Modrić became the oldest ever player to play a game for Croatia―aged 37 years, 6 months and 16 days―surpassing Dražen Ladić's record set in 1999 [359]\n\n\n2024: Euro 2024\nOn 20 May 2024, Modrić was included in the final squad for the UEFA Euro 2024 [366] He became one of only three players to feature in five European Championships [367] In the last group stage match against Italy, he had his penalty saved by Gianluigi Donnarumma, but scored a goal a minute later, becoming the oldest goalscorer at the European competition and overpassing Ivica Vastić for 32 days [368] However, he was awarded player of the match, despite a stoppage-time equalizer from Mattia Zaccagni that resulted in a 1–1 draw, which eliminated his team from the tournament [369]\n\n\nPlayer profile\n\"Not only is he a very hard worker, he has a good brain and he provided some calmness and composure to the midfield His passing was neat and his contribution was outstanding He was not only winning the ball, he was passing well We thought that he was very influential He did not just work hard, he made the other people play well around him\".\n\n\nStyle of play\n\"Not only is he a very hard worker, he has a good brain and he provided some calmness and composure to the midfield His passing was neat and his contribution was outstanding He was not only winning the ball, he was passing well We thought that he was very influential He did not just work hard, he made the other people play well around him\".\n\n\nPosition\nModrić's complex game has brought him consistent success in the clubs for which he has played Initially a trequartista or attacking midfielder at Dinamo Zagreb and in his early career at Tottenham, in the 2010–11 season he flourished in a central midfield role as a deep-lying playmaker (regista) who conducts the attack and creates chances for teammates [387] Afterwards, Modrić acknowledged the role that Harry Redknapp played in shaping of deep-lying his style, saying that dropping back enabled him \"to read the game better\" and show his full \"creativity\" [388] Although a central midfielder, Modrić is also a hard-working player who has been seen to adopt a defensive midfield role in addition to playmaking, tracking back to win the ball from the opposition and prepare for a counter-attack, making him one of the most versatile players in the world, capable of playing in several midfield positions [389] [390] According to Jonathan Wilson, in a 4–2–3–1 system Modrić is a third type of a holding midfielder, being \"neither entirely destructive or creative\", but a \"carrier\" who – courtesy of his dribbling ability and attacking drive – is \"capable of making late runs or carrying the ball at his feet\", but in his case \"with a hint of regista\" [391] [392] [393] As such, his role has also been likened to that of a mezzala, in Italian football jargon, namely an offensive–minded box-to-box or central midfielder [379]\n\n\nReception\nModrić is widely regarded as one of the best and most well-rounded and effective midfielders of all time [403] [404] [405] [406] [6] According to Jonathan Wilson, what sets Modrić apart from traditional playmakers is his simultaneous focus on defensive and attacking duties [407] [408] Due to his footballing intelligence, skill and fairplay he was compared to Paul Scholes, [409] [410] Xavi, Andrés Iniesta, [411] and Andrea Pirlo [412] [413] [414] In his youth, he had also been compared to Johan Cruyff, [48] [269] while his main influences were compatriot Zvonimir Boban and Italian playmaker Francesco Totti [35]\n\n\nPersonal life\nModrić married Vanja Bosnić in May 2010 in the Croatian capital Zagreb in a private ceremony after four years of dating, [434] and a year later in the Catholic Church [435] They have three children [436] [437] [438] [439] Modrić is a cousin of Australian footballer Mark Viduka, [440] and the godfather of Mateo Kovačić's son Ivan [441] Modrić generally maintains a low profile outside of football [37] [442]\n\n\nLegal issues\nIn March 2018, in an embezzlement and tax evasion trial against the former Dinamo Zagreb executive, Zdravko Mamić, Modrić was called as a witness [448] Throughout the mid-late 2000s, Modrić signed multiple contracts with Mamić to play at Dinamo Zagreb [449] [450] Modrić annexed most of his Tottenham transfer fee to Mamić because he was the broker of the move and gave Modrić financial backing early on in his career [451] [452] Despite stating in 2017 that he signed the annexe clause of the contract ten years earlier, in his testimony he stated that he signed it in 2004, the year of his first contract Modrić was charged with perjury for stating that he annexed his fee at an earlier date than he allegedly had [448] Facing the judge, he said, \"I came here to state my defence and tell the truth, like every time so far My conscience is clear\" [450] [453] The Croatian Football Federation stood behind Modrić, [450] but a part of the Croatian public, frustrated with the corruption in Croatian football, perceived the alleged perjury as a defence of Mamić and became critical of Modrić [454] [455] [456] Some international news outlets praised him for dealing with the stress of his legal situation while performing with the Croatian team at the 2018 FIFA World Cup [457] In October and December 2018, the perjury charge was rejected by the Croatian courts [458]

1985 in Zadar and was raised in the hamlet of Modrići, which is a part of Zaton Obrovački, a village situated on the southern slopes of the mountain Velebit, north of the city of Zadar in SR Croatia, then a republic within SFR Yugoslavia. He is the oldest child of Stipe Modrić from Modrići and Radojka Dopuđ from Kruševo near Obrovac, both of whom initially worked in a knitwear factory. Modrić mostly spent his early years in the stone house where usually lived his paternal grandfather after whom he was named, located on the road above the hamlet of Modrići (this \"upper house\" was not owned by the family). He was shepherding goats as a five-year-old.\n\n**Club Career**\n\nSupported by his family, Modrić participated in representative camps and trained in NK Zadar. He was under the tutelage of coach Domagoj Bašić and the head of the youth academy, Tomislav Bašić. Tomislav Bašić, considered by Modrić as his \"sporting father\", said Modrić's father made him wooden shin guards because they had little money. However, Modrić later denied the story. Due to being considered too young and light, he was not signed by Croatian powerhouse Hajduk Split, the most representative football club in the region of Dalmatia. After displaying some talent, including at a youth tournament in Italy, Tomislav Bašić arranged Modrić's move to Dinamo Zagreb when Modrić was a 16-year-old in late 2001. After a season with Dinamo Zagreb's youth side, Modrić was loaned in 2003 to Zrinjski Mostar in the Bosnian Premier League. During this period, he established his versatile style of play and became the Bosnian Premier League Player of the Year at only the age of 18. Modrić later said, \"Someone who can play in the Bosnian Premier League can play anywhere,\" referring to its physical nature. The following year, he was loaned to Croatian side Inter Zaprešić. He spent one season there, helping the team to achieve second position in the Prva HNL and a place in the preliminary round of the UEFA Cup. He also won the Croatian Football Hope of the Year award in 2004.\n\n**Dinamo Zagreb**\n\nIn the 2005–06 season, Modrić signed a ten-year contract with Dinamo Zagreb. With the contract's earnings, he bought a flat in Zadar for his family. He secured a place in Dinamo's first team, contributing 7 goals in 31 matches to help win the league. In the 2006–07 season, Dinamo again won the league, with Modrić making a similar contribution. He was the main provider for striker Eduardo, which helped Modrić win the Prva HNL Player of the Year award. The following season, Modrić as a team captain, led Dinamo's attempt to qualify for the 2007–08 UEFA Cup. In the final play-off stage, Modrić converted a penalty in the second and away fixture against Ajax; the match finished 1–1 after regular time. Dinamo won the match and play-off with a score of 3–2 after extra time with two goals from Mario Mandžukić. However, Dinamo Zagreb failed to advance beyond the group stage.\n\n**Tottenham Hotspur**\n\nModrić agreed to transfer terms with Tottenham Hotspur on 26 April 2008. He was the first of many summer signings for manager Juande Ramos, and was also the Premier League's first summer transfer. Club chairman Daniel Levy promptly flew to Zagreb when Manchester City and Newcastle United became interested, and after signing a six-year contract, Tottenham confirmed the transfer fee paid was £16.5 million, equalling the club's record fee set by Darren Bent's move in 2007. He got the number 14 jersey, later recalling that he wore it in honour of Johan Cruyff. Modrić made his competitive Premier League debut on 16 August in a 2–1 defeat to Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium in Spurs' first match of the 2008–09 season.\n\n**2008–10: Struggle and success in England**\n\nModrić agreed to transfer terms with Tottenham Hotspur on 26 April 2008.

Modrić made his competitive Premier League debut on 16 August in a 2–1 defeat to Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium in Spurs' first match of the 2008–09 season.\n\n**2010–12: Final seasons in England**\n\nOn 11 September 2010, Modrić scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season in a 1–1 away draw at West Bromwich Albion. On 28 November, in a home match against Liverpool, Modrić scored a goal that was later credited as an own goal by Martin Škrtel. After a draw against Manchester United at White Hart Lane in January 2011, Redknapp praised Modrić, saying, \"He was unbelievable Magnificent He's an amazing footballer, the little man takes the ball in the tightest areas with people around him, wriggling out of situations He could play in any team in the world.\" Modrić also scored in Tottenham's 3–2 victory over Stoke City on 9 April, and converted a penalty at Anfield on 15 May in a 2–0 victory over Liverpool. Modrić helped Tottenham reach their first involvement in the UEFA Champions League. In the first match, against Inter Milan at the San Siro on 20 October, he exited the match early due to injury; Spurs lost 4–3, despite the tremendous efforts of Gareth Bale. On the return match at home, on 2 November, Modrić was given too much space to move and dictate the tempo of the match. He created and assisted for the first goal by Rafael van der Vaart in a 3–1 victory. In the next match, against Werder Bremen, Modrić scored the second goal. After a scoreless draw against Milan, Spurs were eliminated from the competition in the quarter-finals by Real Madrid.\n\n**Real Madrid**\n\nOn 27 August 2012, Real Madrid announced they had agreed on a deal with Tottenham for an approximate £30 million transfer fee. Modrić signed a five-year contract with the Spanish club. Two days later, he made his Real Madrid debut against Barcelona in the second leg final of the 2012 Supercopa de España at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, replacing Mesut Özil in the 83rd minute. Madrid won the match, giving Modrić his first trophy with the club 36 hours after his signing was announced. Despite his positive debut, Modrić at first struggled to settle into the team under manager José Mourinho because of his lack of pre-season training, which he missed as a result of his ongoing transfer negotiations. The presence of veteran midfielders Xabi Alonso and Sami Khedira in defensive midfield, and Özil in offensive midfield, usually kept Modrić out of the starting line-up, limiting him to substitute appearances. He mostly played out-of-position for his first few months at the club.\n\n**2013–15: Best midfielder in Spain and La Décima**\n\n\"He's the head of midfield in a complicated environment Every day in Madrid pressure is coming at you from all sides Modrić not only withstands the pressure but has grown among it to be Madrid's best player, with Cristiano Ronaldo.\"\n\nFor the 2013–14 season, Modrić started in more games and became an integral part of the team.

point behind second-placed Ukraine After appearing in all of their UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying matches and scoring a goal against Israel, [279] Modrić started in all three of Croatia group stage matches against the Republic of Ireland, Italy and Spain, but the team failed to progress His most notable performance was against Spain The most memorable moment of the match came when Modrić picked the ball on the halfway line skipping Spain's midfield trio, rushing down on the right to reach the penalty area where he evaded a defender and with a trivela crossed from 18 yd (16 m) to Ivan Rakitić, but Iker Casillas saved this attempt [280] [281] Because Croatia did not advance from the group stage, Modrić was not included in the Team of the Tournament, although The Daily Telegraph included him in

Modrić became the new team captain, following Darijo Srna's retirement [300] Croatia started the campaign well; however, following 1–0 defeats to Iceland [301] and Turkey [302] and a 1–1 draw with Finland (in which Modrić made his 100th appearance for the national team), [303] [304] Croatia seriously compromised their qualification for the tournament [305] [306] This caused Modrić to publicly state his lack of confidence in coach Ante Čačić [307] [308] [309] Čačić was soon replaced by Zlatko Dalić ahead of Croatia's final qualifier against Ukraine away, [310] which Croatia won 2–0 and won

qualifying victory over Cyprus, he surpassed Srna's record [341] [342]\n\n\n2023: Euro 2024 qualifying and Nations League finals\nOn 25 March 2023, in a UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying match against Wales, Modrić became the oldest ever player to play a game for Croatia―aged 37 years, 6 months and 16 days―surpassing Dražen Ladić's record set in 1999 [359]\n\n\n2024: Euro 2024\nOn 20 May 2024, Modrić was included in the final squad for the UEFA Euro 2024 [366] He became one of only three players to feature in five European Championships [367] In the last group stage match against Italy, he had his penalty saved by Gianluigi Donnarumma, but scored a goal a minute later, becoming the oldest goalscorer at the European competition and overpassing Ivica Vastić for 32 days [368] However, he was awarded player of the match, despite a stoppage-time equalizer from Mattia Zaccagni that resulted in a 1–1 draw, which eliminated his team from the tournament [369]\n\n\nPlayer profile\n\"Not only is he a very hard worker, he has a good brain and he provided some calmness and composure to the midfield His passing was neat and his contribution was outstanding He was not only winning the ball, he was passing well We thought that he was very influential He did not just work hard, he made the other people play well around him\".\n\n\nStyle of play\n\"Not only is he a very hard worker, he has a good brain and he provided some calmness and composure to the midfield His passing was neat and his contribution was outstanding He was not only winning the ball, he was passing well We thought that he was very influential He did not just work hard, he made the other people play well around him\".\n\n\nPosition\nModrić's complex game has brought him consistent success in the clubs for which he has played Initially a trequartista or attacking midfielder at Dinamo Zagreb and in his early career at Tottenham, in the 2010–11 season he flourished in a central midfield role as a deep-lying playmaker (regista) who conducts the attack and creates chances for teammates [387] Afterwards, Modrić acknowledged the role that Harry Redknapp played in shaping of deep-lying his style, saying that dropping back enabled him \"to read the game better\" and show his full \"creativity\" [388] Although a central midfielder, Modrić is also a hard-working player who has been seen to adopt a defensive midfield role in addition to playmaking, tracking back to win the ball from the opposition and prepare for a counter-attack, making him one of the most versatile players in the world, capable of playing in several midfield positions [389] [390] According to Jonathan Wilson, in a 4–2–3–1 system Modrić is a third type of a holding midfielder, being \"neither entirely destructive or creative\", but a \"carrier\" who – courtesy of his dribbling ability and attacking drive – is \"capable of making late runs or carrying the ball at his feet\", but in his case \"with a hint of regista\" [391] [392] [393] As such, his role has also been likened to that of a mezzala, in Italian football jargon, namely an offensive–minded box-to-box or central midfielder [379]\n\n\nReception\nModrić is widely regarded as one of the best and most well-rounded and effective midfielders of all time [403] [404] [405] [406] [6] According to Jonathan Wilson, what sets Modrić apart from traditional playmakers is his simultaneous focus on defensive and attacking duties [407] [408] Due to his footballing intelligence, skill and fairplay he was compared to Paul Scholes, [409] [410] Xavi, Andrés Iniesta, [411] and Andrea Pirlo [412] [413] [414] In his youth, he had also been compared to Johan Cruyff, [48] [269] while his main influences were compatriot Zvonimir Boban and Italian playmaker Francesco Totti [35]\n\n\nPersonal life\nModrić married Vanja Bosnić in May 2010 in the Croatian capital Zagreb in a private ceremony after four years of dating, [434] and a year later in the Catholic Church [435] They have three children [436] [437] [438] [439] Modrić is a cousin of Australian footballer Mark Viduka, [440] and the godfather of Mateo Kovačić's son Ivan [441] Modrić generally maintains a low profile outside of football [37] [442]\n\n\nLegal issues\nIn March 2018, in an embezzlement and tax evasion trial against the former Dinamo Zagreb executive, Zdravko Mamić, Modrić was called as a witness [448] Throughout the mid-late 2000s, Modrić signed multiple contracts with Mamić to play at Dinamo Zagreb [449] [450] Modrić annexed most of his Tottenham transfer fee to Mamić because he was the broker of the move and gave Modrić financial backing early on in his career [451] [452] Despite stating in 2017 that he signed the annexe clause of the contract ten years earlier, in his testimony he stated that he signed it in 2004, the year of his first contract Modrić was charged with perjury for stating that he annexed his fee at an earlier date than he allegedly had [448] Facing the judge, he said, \"I came here to state my defence and tell the truth, like every time so far My conscience is clear\" [450] [453] The Croatian Football Federation stood behind Modrić, [450] but a part of the Croatian public, frustrated with the corruption in Croatian football, perceived the alleged perjury as a defence of Mamić and became critical of Modrić [454] [455] [456] Some international news outlets praised him for dealing with the stress of his legal situation while performing with the Croatian team at the 2018 FIFA World Cup [457] In October and December 2018, the perjury charge was rejected by the Croatian courts [458] [459]\n\n\nCareer statistics\nDinamo Zagreb [3]\n\n\nClub\nDinamo Zagreb [3]\n\n\nInternational\nDinamo Zagreb [3]\n\n\nHonours\nDinamo Zagreb [3]\n\n\nSee

sympathies for the victims [52] [287] Spontaneous, improvised temporary memorials appeared at the sites of the deaths in Boston and Cambridge Over the next few years, permanent memorials were constructed and dedicated at these locations.\n\n\nAid to victims\nThe One Fund Boston was established by Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick and Boston mayor Thomas Menino to make monetary distributions to bombing victims [288] [289] The Boston Strong concert at the TD Garden in Boston on May 30, 2013, benefitted the One Fund, which ultimately received more than $69.8 million in donations [290] A week after the bombing, crowdfunding websites [291] received more than 23,000 pledges promising more than $2 million for the victims, their families, and others affected by the bombing [292] The Israel Trauma Coalition for Response and Preparedness sent six psychologists and specialists from Israel to help Boston emergency responders, government administrators, and community people develop post-terrorist attack recovery strategies [293]\n\n\nLocal reactions\nNumerous sporting events, concerts, and other public entertainment were postponed or canceled in the days following the bombing [295] [296] [297] [298] The MBTA public transit system was under heavy National Guard and police presence and it was shut down a second time April 19 during the manhunt [74] [116] [299]\n\n\nNational reactions\nPresident Barack Obama addressed the nation after the attack [315] He said that the perpetrators were still unknown, but that the government would \"get to the bottom of this\" and that those responsible \"will feel the full weight of justice\" [316] He ordered flags to half-staff until April 20 on all federal buildings as \"a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence perpetrated on April 15, 2013 in Boston, Massachusetts\" [317]\n\n\nInternational reactions\nThe bombing was denounced and condolences were offered by many international leaders as well as leading figures from international sport Security measures were increased worldwide in the wake of the attack [324] [325] [326] [327]\n\n\nRussian reaction\nThe Russian government said that special attention would be paid to security at upcoming international sports events in Russia, including the 2014 Winter Olympics [340] According to the Russian embassy in the U.S., President Vladimir Putin condemned the bombing as a \"barbaric crime\" and \"stressed that the Russian Federation will be ready, if necessary, to assist in the U.S authorities' investigation\" [341] He urged closer cooperation of security services with Western partners [342] but other Russian authorities and mass media blamed the U.S authorities for negligence as they warned the U.S of the Tsarnaevs [343] Moreover Russian authorities and mass media since the spring of 2014 blame the United States for politically motivated false information about the lack of response from Russian authorities after subsequent U.S requests [citation needed] As proof a letter from the Russian FSB was shown to the members of an official U.S Congressional delegation to Moscow during their visit This letter with information about Tsarnaev (including his biography details, connections and phone number) had been sent from the FSB to the FBI and CIA during March 2011 [344]\n\n\nChechen reactions\nOn April 19, 2013, the press secretary of the head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, issued a statement that, inter alia, read: \"The Boston bombing suspects have nothing to do with Chechnya\" [347] [348] On the same day, Kadyrov was reported by The Guardian to have written on Instagram: [349]\n\n\nCriticism of the \"shelter-in-place\" directive and house-to-house searches\nDuring the manhunt for the perpetrators of the bombing, Governor Deval Patrick said \"we are asking people to shelter in place\" The request was highly effective; most people stayed home, causing Boston, Watertown, and Cambridge to come to a virtual standstill According to Time magazine, \"media described residents complying with a 'lockdown order,' but in reality the governor's security measure was a request\" Scott Silliman, emeritus director of the Center on Law, Ethics and National Security at Duke Law School, said that the shelter-in-place request was voluntary [354]\n\n\nOne Boston Day\nOn the second anniversary of the Boston Marathon Bombings, Mayor Marty Walsh established April 15, the day of the bombings, as an official and permanent holiday called \"One Boston Day\", dedicated to conducting random acts of kindness and helping others out [358] Over the past eight years, some examples of acts of kindness being done have been donating blood to the American Red Cross, donating food to the Greater Boston Food Bank, opening free admission in places like the Museum of Science and Museum of Fine Arts, donating shoes to homeless shelters, and donating to military and veteran charities [359] [360]\n\n\nConspiracy theories\nA number of conspiracy theories arose in the immediate wake of the attacks and after more information about the Tsarnaev brothers came to light [361] This can be common in the aftermath of acts of domestic terrorism, especially the September 11 attacks [362]\n\n\nConflicting reports\nOn the afternoon of the bombing, the New York Post reported that a suspect, a Saudi Arabian male, was under guard and being questioned at a Boston hospital [377] That evening, Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said that there had not been an arrest [378] The Post did not retract its story about the suspect, leading to widespread reports by CBS News, CNN, and other media that a Middle Eastern suspect was in custody [379] The day after the bombing, a majority of outlets were reporting that the Saudi was a witness, not a suspect [380]\n\n\nSee also\nCongressional hearings\n\n\nFootnotes\nCongressional

yards (190 m) apart at the finish line on Boylston Street near Copley Square [24] [25] [26] [27] The first exploded outside Marathon Sports at 671–673 Boylston Street at 2:49:43 p.m [24] At the time of the first explosion, the race clock at the finish line showed 04:09:43 [28]—the elapsed time since the Wave 3 start at 10:40 a.m The second bomb exploded at 2:49:57 p.m., [25] [29] 14 seconds later and one block farther west at 755 Boylston Street [6] The explosions took place nearly three hours after the winning runner crossed the finish line, [29] but with more than 5,700 runners yet to finish [30]\n\n\nCasualties and initial response\nRescue workers and medical personnel, on hand as usual for the marathon, gave aid as additional police, fire, and medical units were dispatched, [33] [34] including from surrounding cities as well as private ambulances from all over the state The explosions killed three civilians and injured 264 others [5] [35]\n\n\nInitial investigation\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation led the investigation, assisted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Counterterrorism Center, and the Drug Enforcement Administration [47] It was initially believed by some that North Korea was behind the attack [48] [49]\n\n\nApril 18–19 shootings and search\nJeff Bauman was immediately adjacent to one of the bombs and lost both legs; he wrote while in the hospital: \"Bag, saw the guy, looked right at me\" [65] He later gave a detailed description of the suspects, which enabled images of them to be identified and circulated quickly [65] [66] [67]\n\n\nRelease of suspect photos\nJeff Bauman was immediately adjacent to one of the bombs and lost both legs; he wrote while in the hospital: \"Bag, saw the guy, looked right at me\" [65] He later gave a detailed description of the suspects, which enabled images of them to be identified and circulated quickly [65] [66] [67]\n\n\nMIT shooting and carjacking\nHours after the FBI released photos of the two suspects in the bombing, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev visited their family's apartment in Cambridge There, they obtained five improvised explosive devices (IEDs), ammunition, a semiautomatic handgun, and a machete The two brothers then drove to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology [15]\n\n\nWatertown shootout\nShortly after midnight on April 19, Watertown police officer Joseph Reynolds identified the brothers in the Honda and the stolen Mercedes after overhearing radio traffic that the vehicle was \"pinged\" by Cambridge officers on Dexter Avenue in Watertown Reynolds followed the vehicle while waiting for additional units to perform a high-risk traffic stop when the suspect vehicles both turned onto Laurel Street and stopped at the intersection of Laurel and Dexter [citation needed]\n\n\nFurther investigation and post-shootout search for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev\nRecords on the Honda left at the Watertown shootout scene identified the bombers [102] Tamerlan and Dzhokhar \"Jahar\" Tsarnaev [103] [104] The FBI released additional photos of the two during the Watertown incident [105] Early on April 19, investigators released the name and photo of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to the public [15] In addition, Watertown residents received automated calls asking them to stay indoors [106] That same morning Governor Patrick asked residents of Watertown and adjacent cities and towns [107] [108] [109] to \"shelter in place\" [110] Somerville residents also received automated calls instructing them to shelter in place [111]\n\n\nLegal proceedings\nUnited States Senators Kelly Ayotte, Saxby Chambliss, Lindsey Graham, and John McCain, and Representative Peter T King suggested that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, a U.S citizen, should be tried as an unlawful enemy combatant rather than as a criminal, potentially preventing him from obtaining legal counsel [138] [139] Others said that doing so would be illegal, including prominent American legal scholar and lawyer Alan Dershowitz, and would jeopardize the prosecution [140] [141] The government decided to try Dzhokhar in the federal criminal court system and not as an enemy combatant [142]\n\n\nInterrogation\nUnited States Senators Kelly Ayotte, Saxby Chambliss, Lindsey Graham, and John McCain, and Representative Peter T King suggested that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, a U.S citizen, should be tried as an unlawful enemy combatant rather than as a criminal, potentially preventing him from obtaining legal counsel [138] [139] Others said that doing so would be illegal,

charges carried potential sentences of life imprisonment or the death penalty [148] Tsarnaev was judged to be awake, mentally competent, and lucid, and he responded to most questions by nodding The judge asked him whether he was able to afford an attorney and he said no; he was represented by the Federal Public Defender's office [149] On April 26, Dzhohkar Tsarnaev was moved from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center to the Federal Medical Center at Fort Devens, about 40 miles (64 km) from Boston FMC Devens is a federal prison medical facility at a former Army base [150] where he was held

United States, eventually settling in Upper Canada near Kingston, Ontario in 1810 [8] His brother, Peter (1955–2021), was also an actor.\n\n\nCareer\nAykroyd gained fame on the American late-night comedy show Saturday Night Live (SNL) He was originally hired, and paid $278 a week (equivalent to $1,603 in 2024), as a writer for the show, but became a part of the cast before the series premiered The original cast was referred to on the show as \"The Not Ready For Prime Time Players\" Aykroyd was the youngest member of the cast, and appeared on the show for its first four seasons, from 1975 to 1979 He brought a sensibility to the show which combined youth, unusual interests, talent as an impersonator, and a manic intensity Guest host Eric Idle of Monty Python said that Aykroyd's ability to write and act out characters made him the only member of the SNL cast capable of being a Python [14]\n\n\nSaturday Night Live\nAykroyd gained fame on the American late-night comedy show Saturday Night

spark the Blues Brothers act When they met in a club that Aykroyd frequented, he played a blues record in the background, and it stimulated a fascination with blues in Belushi, who was primarily a fan of heavy rock bands at the time Aykroyd educated Belushi on the finer points of blues music, and with a little encouragement from then-SNL music director Paul Shaffer, it led to the creation of their Blues Brothers characters [24] [25]\n\n\nOther film and television work\nConcurrent with his work in Saturday Night Live, Aykroyd played the role of Purvis Bickle, lift operator at the fictitious

with John Belushi\nIn an appearance on the Today show, Aykroyd referred to John Belushi and himself as \"kindred spirits\" In the biography Belushi, Aykroyd claims that Belushi was the only man with whom he could ever dance The pair were scheduled to present the Academy Award for Visual Effects in 1982, but Belushi died just a few weeks prior to the ceremony Though devastated by his friend's death, Aykroyd presented the award alone, remarking from the stage, \"My partner would have loved to have been here to present this, given that he was something of a visual effect himself.\"

occurred in Belarusian, where the present-day reflex is /ɣ/ [citation needed]\n\n\nTheories\nSpecific developments that led to a gradual change of the Old East Slavic vowel system into the system found in modern Ukrainian began approximately in the 12th/13th century (that is, still at the time of the Kievan Rus') with a lengthening and raising of the Old East Slavic mid vowels e and o when

fricativisation of Old East Slavic г /g/ occurred in Belarusian, where the present-day reflex is /ɣ/ [citation needed]\n\n\nOrigins and developments during medieval times\nAs a result of close Slavic contacts with the remnants of the Scythian and Sarmatian population north of the Black Sea, lasting into the early Middle Ages, the appearance of the voiced fricative γ/г (romanized \"h\"), in modern Ukrainian and some southern Russian dialects is explained by the assumption that it initially emerged in Scythian and related eastern Iranian dialects, from earlier common Proto-Indo-European *g and *gʰ [21] [22] [23]\n\n\nDevelopments under Poland and Lithuania\nIn the 13th century, eastern parts of Rus (including Moscow) came under Tatar rule until their unification under the Tsardom of Muscovy, whereas the south-western areas (including Kyiv) were incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania For the following four centuries, the languages of the two regions evolved in relative isolation from each other Direct written evidence of the existence of the Ukrainian language dates to the late 16th century [25] By the 16th century, a peculiar official language formed: a mixture of  the liturgical standardised language of Old Church Slavonic, Ruthenian and Polish The influence of the latter gradually increased relative to the former two, as the nobility and rural large-landowning class, known as the szlachta, was largely Polish-speaking Documents soon took on many Polish characteristics superimposed on Ruthenian phonetics [26]\n\n\nChronology\nThe accepted chronology of Ukrainian divides the language into Old Ukrainian, Middle Ukrainian, and Modern Ukrainian [29] Shevelov explains that much of this is based on the character of contemporary written sources, ultimately reflecting socio-historical developments, and he further subdivides the Middle period into three phases: [30] [31] [32] [33]\n\n\nHistory of the spoken language\nThe era of Kievan Rus' (c 880–1240) is the subject of some linguistic controversy, as the language of much of the literature was purely or heavily Old Church Slavonic Some theorists [which?] see an early Ukrainian stage in language development here, calling it Old Ruthenian; others [which?] term this era Old East Slavic Russian theorists tend to amalgamate Rus' to the modern nation of Russia, and call this linguistic era Old Russian However, according to Russian linguist Andrey Zaliznyak (2012), people from the Novgorod Republic did not call themselves Rus' until the 14th century; earlier Novgorodians reserved the term Rus' for the Kiev, Pereyaslavl and Chernigov principalities [17] At the same time as evidenced by contemporary chronicles, the ruling princes and kings of Galicia–Volhynia and Kiev called themselves \"people of Rus'\" (in foreign sources called \"Ruthenians\"), [citation needed] and Galicia–Volhynia has alternately been called the Principality or Kingdom of Ruthenia [34]\n\n\nRus' and Kingdom of Ruthenia\nThe era of Kievan Rus' (c 880–1240) is the subject of some linguistic controversy, as the language of much of the literature was purely or heavily Old Church Slavonic Some theorists [which?] see an early Ukrainian stage in language development here, calling it Old Ruthenian; others [which?] term this era Old East Slavic Russian theorists tend to amalgamate Rus' to the modern nation of Russia, and call this linguistic era Old Russian However, according to Russian linguist Andrey Zaliznyak (2012), people from the Novgorod Republic did not call themselves Rus' until the 14th century; earlier Novgorodians reserved the term Rus' for the Kiev, Pereyaslavl and Chernigov principalities [17] At the same time as evidenced by contemporary chronicles, the ruling princes and kings of Galicia–Volhynia and Kiev called themselves \"people of Rus'\" (in foreign sources called \"Ruthenians\"), [citation needed] and Galicia–Volhynia has alternately been called the Principality or Kingdom of Ruthenia [34]\n\n\nUnder Lithuania/Poland, Muscovy/Russia and Austria-Hungary\nAfter the fall of the Kingdom of Ruthenia, Ukrainians mainly fell under the rule of Lithuania and then Poland Local autonomy of both rule and language was a marked feature of Lithuanian rule In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Old East Slavic became the language of the chancellery and gradually evolved into the Ruthenian language Polish rule, which came later, was accompanied by a more assimilationist policy By the 1569 Union of Lublin that formed the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, a significant part of Ukrainian territory was moved from Lithuanian rule to Polish administration, resulting in cultural Polonization and visible attempts to colonize Ukraine by the Polish nobility [35]\n\n\nSpeakers in the Russian Empire\nIn the Russian Empire Census of 1897 the following picture emerged, with Ukrainian being the second most spoken language of the Russian Empire According to the Imperial census's terminology, the Russian language (Русскій) was subdivided into Ukrainian (Малорусскій, 'Little Russian'), what is known as Russian today (Великорусскій, 'Great Russian'), and Belarusian (Бѣлорусскій, 'White Russian') [citation needed]\n\n\nSoviet era\nDuring the seven-decade-long Soviet era, the Ukrainian language held the formal position of the principal local language in the Ukrainian SSR [53] However, practice was often a different story: [53] Ukrainian always had to compete with Russian, and the attitudes of the Soviet leadership towards Ukrainian varied from encouragement and tolerance to de facto banishment [citation needed]\n\n\nStalin\nAfter the death of Stalin (1953), a general policy of relaxing the language policies of the past was implemented (1958 to 1963) The Khrushchev era which followed saw a policy of relatively lenient concessions to development of the languages at the local and republic level, though its results in Ukraine did not go nearly as far as those of the Soviet policy of Ukrainianization in the 1920s Journals and encyclopedic publications advanced in the Ukrainian language during the Khrushchev era, as well as transfer of Crimea under Ukrainian SSR jurisdiction [citation needed]\n\n\nKhrushchev thaw\nAfter the death of Stalin (1953), a general policy of relaxing the language policies of the past was implemented (1958 to 1963) The Khrushchev era

Soviet policy of Ukrainianization in the 1920s Journals and encyclopedic publications advanced in the Ukrainian language during the Khrushchev era, as well as transfer of Crimea under Ukrainian SSR jurisdiction [citation needed]\n\n\nShelest period\nThe Communist Party leader from 1963 to 1972, Petro Shelest, pursued a policy of defending Ukraine's interests within the Soviet Union He proudly promoted the beauty of the Ukrainian language and developed plans to expand the role of Ukrainian in higher education He was removed, however, after only a brief tenure, for being too lenient on Ukrainian nationalism [citation needed]\n\n\nShcherbytsky period\nThe new party boss from 1972 to 1989, Volodymyr Shcherbytsky, purged the local party, was fierce in suppressing dissent, and insisted Russian be spoken at all official functions, even at local levels His policy of Russification was lessened only slightly after 1985 [citation needed]\n\n\nGorbachev and perebudova\nThe management of dissent by the local Ukrainian Communist Party was more fierce and thorough than in other parts of the Soviet Union As a result, at the start of the Mikhail Gorbachev reforms perebudova and hlasnist’ (Ukrainian for perestroika and glasnost), Ukraine under Shcherbytsky was slower to liberalize than Russia itself [citation needed]\n\n\nIndependence in the modern era\nSince 1991, Ukrainian has been the official state language in Ukraine, and the state administration implemented government policies to broaden the use of Ukrainian The educational system in Ukraine has been transformed over the first decade of independence from a system that is partly Ukrainian to one that is overwhelmingly so The government has also mandated a progressively increased role for Ukrainian in the media and commerce [citation needed]\n\n\nLiterature and literary language\nThe literary Ukrainian language, which was preceded by Old East Slavic literature, may be subdivided into two stages: during the 12th to 18th centuries what in Ukraine is referred to as \"Old Ukrainian\", but elsewhere, and in contemporary sources, is known as the Ruthenian language, and from the end of the 18th century to the present what in Ukraine is known as \"Modern Ukrainian\", but elsewhere is known as just Ukrainian [citation needed]\n\n\nCurrent usage\nThe use of the Ukrainian language is increasing after a long period of decline Although there are almost fifty million ethnic Ukrainians worldwide, including 37.5 million in Ukraine in 2001 (77.8% of the total population at the time), the Ukrainian language is prevalent mainly in western and central Ukraine In Kyiv, both Ukrainian and Russian are spoken, a notable shift from the recent past when the city was primarily Russian-speaking [61]\n\n\nPopular culture\nUkrainian has become popular in other countries through movies and songs performed in the Ukrainian language The most popular Ukrainian rock bands, such as Okean Elzy, Vopli Vidopliassova, and BoomBox perform regularly in tours across Europe, Israel, North America and especially Russia In countries with significant Ukrainian populations, bands singing in the Ukrainian language sometimes reach top places on the charts, such as Enej (a band from Poland) Other notable Ukrainian-language bands are The Ukrainians from the United Kingdom, Klooch from Canada, Ukrainian Village Band from the United States, and the Kuban Cossack Choir from the Kuban region in Russia [citation needed]\n\n\nMusic\nUkrainian has become popular in other countries through movies and songs performed in the

needed]\n\n\nCinema\nThe 2010s saw a revival of Ukrainian cinema [64] The top Ukrainian-language films (by IMDb rating) are: [65] [better source needed]\n\n\nArgots\nOleksa Horbach's 1951 study of argots analyzed historical primary sources (argots of professionals, thugs, prisoners, homeless, school children, etc.) paying special attention to etymological features of argots, word formation and borrowing patterns depending on the source-language (Church Slavonic, Russian, Czech, Polish, Romani, Greek, Romanian, Hungarian, German) [66]\n\n\nDialects\nSeveral modern dialects of Ukrainian exist [67] [68]\n\n\nNeighbouring countries\nAll the countries neighbouring Ukraine (except for Hungary) historically have regions with a sizable Ukrainian population and therefore Ukrainian language speakers Ukrainian is an official minority language in Belarus, Romania, and Moldova [citation needed]\n\n\nUkrainian diaspora\nUkrainian is also spoken by a large émigrée population, particularly in Canada, the United States, and several countries of South America like Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay [citation needed] The founders of this population primarily emigrated from Galicia, which used to be part of Austro-Hungary before World War I, and belonged to Poland between the World Wars The language spoken by most of them is the Galician dialect of Ukrainian from the first half of the 20th century Compared with modern Ukrainian, the vocabulary of Ukrainians outside Ukraine reflects less influence of Russian, but often contains many loanwords from the local language [citation needed]\n\n\nLanguage structure\nUkrainian is a fusional, nominative–accusative, satellite-framed language It exhibits T–V distinction, and is null-subject The canonical word order of Ukrainian is SVO [92] Other word orders are common due to the free word order enabled by Ukrainian's inflectional system [citation needed]\n\n\nGrammar\nUkrainian is a fusional, nominative–accusative, satellite-framed language It exhibits T–V distinction, and is null-subject The canonical word order of Ukrainian is SVO [92] Other word orders are common due to the free word order enabled by Ukrainian's inflectional

of 33 letters, representing 38 phonemes; an apostrophe is also used  Ukrainian orthography is based on the phonemic principle, with one letter generally corresponding to one phoneme, although there are a number of exceptions The orthography also has cases where the semantic, historical, and morphological principles are applied [citation needed]\n\n\nTransliteration\nSpelling search, [clarification needed] which began in the late 18th century with the emergence of modern literary language, led to the emergence of several spelling options In particular, there was the spelling system of Oleksii Pavlovskyi, the spelling version of \"Mermaid of the Dniester\" (1837), Kulishivka (P Kulish's spelling system), Drahomanivka (produced in Kyiv in the 1870s by a group of cultural figures led by linguist P Zhytetskyi, which included and M Drahomanov), Zhelekhivka (system of Yevhen Zhelekhovskyi (1886), enshrined in the Russian Grammar by Smal-Stotskyi and Theodore Gartner 1893)

catalog of the Ukrainian Institute of Language Studies has six million cards [97] As mentioned at the top of the article, Ukrainian is most closely related lexically to Belarusian, and is also closer to Polish than to Russian (for example, можливість, mozhlyvist', \"possibility\", and Polish możliwość, but Russian возможность, vozmozhnostʹ) [citation needed]\n\n\nFalse cognates with Russian\nThe standard Ukrainian language which is based on the Kyiv–Poltava dialect has a plethora of false friends with the standard Russian language which is based on the dialect of Moscow Many people intentionally do or do not use them, causing their language shift into what is known as Surzhyk, where the meaning of some words mimicking Russian could be understood out of context rather than their literal meaning in Ukrainian [citation needed]\n\n\nClassification\nUkrainian has varying degrees of mutual intelligibility with other Slavic languages It is closely related to other East Slavic languages with high levels of mutual intelligibility [6]  Ukrainian is considered to be most closely related to Belarusian [98]\n\n\nDifferences with other Slavic languages\nThe Ukrainian language has

The language developed from the Old East Slavic language, which was spoken in the Kievan Rus' state. Over time, the Ukrainian language evolved and diverged from Russian and Belarusian, becoming a distinct language in its own right.\n\n**Specific Developments**\n\nSeveral specific developments led to the gradual change of the Old East Slavic vowel system into the system found in modern Ukrainian. These developments included the lengthening and raising of mid vowels, the merger of vowel phonemes, and the fricativization of consonants. These changes occurred primarily in the 12th to 13th centuries and had a significant impact on the Ukrainian language.\n\n**Theories**\n\nTheories on the origins and development of the Ukrainian language are numerous and varied. Some linguists believe that the language developed from a common Proto-Slavic language, while others propose that it emerged from a distinct Ukrainian dialect of Old East Slavic.\n\n**Origins and Developments During Medieval Times**\n\nThe appearance of the voiced fricative γ/г (romanized \"h\") in modern Ukrainian and some southern Russian dialects is explained by the assumption that it initially emerged in Scythian and related eastern Iranian dialects. This theory suggests that the Scythian and Sarmatian population north of the Black Sea had a significant impact on the development of the Ukrainian language.\n\n**Developments Under Poland and Lithuania**\n\nIn the 13th century, eastern parts of Rus came under Tatar rule, while the south-western areas were incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. This led to a period of relative isolation for the Ukrainian language, during which time it evolved in distinct ways from Russian and Belarusian.\n\n**Chronology**\n\nThe accepted chronology of Ukrainian divides the language into three periods: Old Ukrainian (12th to 15th centuries), Middle Ukrainian (15th to 18th centuries), and Modern Ukrainian (19th century to present). This chronology is based on the character of contemporary written sources and reflects socio-historical developments.\n\n**History of the Spoken Language**\n\nThe era of Kievan Rus' (c 880–1240) is the subject of some linguistic controversy, as the language of much of the literature was purely or heavily Old Church Slavonic. Some theorists see an early Ukrainian stage in language development here, calling it Old Ruthenian, while others term this era Old East Slavic.\n\n**Rus' and Kingdom of Ruthenia**\n\nThe era of Kievan Rus' (c 880–1240) is the subject of some linguistic controversy, as the language of much of the literature was purely or heavily Old Church Slavonic. Some theorists see an early Ukrainian stage in language development here, calling it Old Ruthenian, while others term this era Old East Slavic.\n\n**Under Lithuania/Poland, Muscovy/Russia and Austria-Hungary**\n\nAfter the fall of the Kingdom of Ruthenia, Ukrainians mainly fell under the rule of Lithuania and then Poland. Local autonomy of both rule and language was a marked feature of Lithuanian rule. In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Old East Slavic became the language of the chancellery and gradually evolved into the Ruthenian language.\n\n**Speakers in the Russian Empire**\n\nIn the Russian Empire Census of 1897, the following picture emerged, with Ukrainian being the second most spoken language of the Russian Empire. According to the Imperial census's terminology, the Russian language was subdivided into Ukrainian (Малорусскій, 'Little Russian'), what is known as Russian today (Великорусскій, 'Great Russian'), and Belarusian (Бѣлорусскій, 'White Russian').\n\n**Soviet Era**\n\nDuring the seven-decade-long Soviet era, the Ukrainian language held the formal position of the principal local language in the Ukrainian SSR. However, practice was often a different story; Ukrainian always had to compete with Russian, and the attitudes of the Soviet leadership towards Ukrainian varied from encouragement and tolerance to de facto banishment.\n\n**Independence in the Modern Era**\n\nSince 1991, Ukrainian has been the official state language in Ukraine, and the state administration has implemented government policies to broaden the use of Ukrainian. The educational system in Ukraine has been transformed over the first decade of independence from a system that is partly Ukrainian to one that is overwhelmingly so.\n\n**Literature and Literary Language**\n\nThe literary Ukrainian language, which was preceded by Old East Slavic literature, may be subdivided into two stages: during the 12th to 18th centuries what in Ukraine is referred to as \"Old Ukrainian\", but elsewhere, and in contemporary sources, is known as the Ruthenian language, and from the end of the 18th century to the present what in Ukraine is known as \"Modern Ukrainian\", but elsewhere is known as just Ukrainian.\n\n**Current Usage**\n\nThe use of the Ukrainian language is increasing after a long period of decline. Although there are almost fifty million ethnic Ukrainians worldwide, including 37.5 million in Ukraine in 2001 (77.8% of the total population at the time), the Ukrainian language is prevalent mainly in western and central Ukraine.\n\n**Popular Culture**\n\nUkrainian has become popular in other countries through movies and songs performed in the Ukrainian language. The most popular Ukrainian rock bands, such as Okean Elzy, Vopli Vidopliassova, and BoomBox perform regularly in tours across Europe, Israel, North America, and especially Russia.\n\n**Cinema**\n\nThe 2010s saw a revival of Ukrainian cinema. The top Ukrainian-language films (by IMDb rating) are: ...\n\n**Argots**\n\nOleksa Horbach's 1951 study of argots analyzed historical primary sources (argots of professionals, thugs, prisoners, homeless, school children, etc.) paying special attention to etymological features of argots, word formation, and borrowing patterns depending on the source-language (Church Slavonic, Russian, Czech, Polish, Romani, Greek, Romanian, Hungarian, German).\n\n**Dialects**\n\nSeveral modern dialects of Ukrainian exist. These dialects are spoken in different regions of Ukraine and are often geographically specific.\n\n**Neighbouring Countries**\n\nAll the countries neighboring Ukraine (except for Hungary) historically have regions with a sizable Ukrainian population and therefore Ukrainian language speakers. Ukrainian is an official minority language in Belarus, Romania, and Moldova.\n\n**Ukrainian Diaspora**\n\nUkrainian is also spoken by a large émigrée population, particularly in Canada, the United States, and several countries of South America like Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. The founders of this population primarily emigrated from Galicia, which used to be part of Austro-Hungary before World War I, and belonged to Poland between the World Wars.\n\n**Language Structure**\n\nUkrainian is a fusional, nominative–accusative, satellite-framed language. It exhibits T–V distinction, and is null-subject. The canonical word order of Ukrainian is SVO.\n\n**Grammar**\n\nUkrainian is a fusional, nominative–accusative, satellite-framed language. It exhibits T–V distinction, and is null-subject.\n\n**Phonology**\n\nThe Ukrainian language has six vowels: /i/, /u/, /ɪ/, /ɛ/, /ɔ/, /a/.\n\n**Alphabet**\n\nUkrainian is written in a version of Cyrillic, consisting of 33 letters, representing 38 phonemes; an apostrophe is also used.\n\n**Transliteration**\n\nSpelling search, which began in the late 18th century with the emergence of modern literary language, led to the emergence of several spelling options.\n\n**Orthography**\n\nSpelling search, which began in the late 18th century with the emergence of modern literary language, led to the emergence of several spelling options.\n\n**Vocabulary**\n\nThe Dictionary of the Ukrainian Language, in 11 volumes, contains 253,000 entries. Lexical card catalog of the Ukrainian Institute of Language Studies has six million cards.\n\n**False Cognates with Russian**\n\nThe standard Ukrainian language which is based on the Kyiv–Poltava dialect has a plethora of false friends with the standard Russian language which is based on the dialect of Moscow.\n\n**Classification**\n\nUkrainian has varying degrees of mutual intelligibility with other Slavic languages. It is closely related to other East Slavic languages with high levels of mutual intelligibility. Ukrainian is considered to be most closely related to Belarusian.\n\n**Differences with Other Slavic Languages**\n\nThe Ukrainian language has the following similarities and differences with other Slavic languages.\n\n**Sample Text**\n\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Ukrainian:", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ukrainian_language\" following this outline:\n\n\nLinguistic development\nSpecific developments that led to a gradual change of the Old East Slavic vowel system into the system found in modern Ukrainian began approximately in the 12th/13th century (that is, still at the time of the Kievan Rus') with a lengthening and raising of the Old East Slavic mid vowels e and o when followed by a consonant and a weak yer vowel that would eventually disappear completely, for example Old East Slavic котъ /kɔtə/ > Ukrainian кіт /kit/ 'cat' (via transitional stages such as /koˑtə̆/, /kuˑt(ə̆)/, /kyˑt/ or similar) or Old East Slavic печь /pʲɛtʃʲə/ > Ukrainian піч /pitʃ/ 'oven' (via transitional stages such as /pʲeˑtʃʲə̆/, /pʲiˑtʃʲ/ or similar) [15] This raising and other phonological developments of the time, such as the merger of the Old East Slavic vowel phonemes и /i/ and ы /ɨ/ into the specifically Ukrainian phoneme /ɪ ~ e/, spelled with и (in the 13th/14th centuries), and the fricativisation of the Old East Slavic consonant г /g/, probably first to /ɣ/ (in the 13th century), with /ɦ/ as a reflex in Modern Ukrainian, did not happen in Russian Only the fricativisation of Old East Slavic г /g/ occurred in Belarusian, where the present-day reflex is /ɣ/ [citation needed]\n\n\nTheories\nSpecific developments that led to a gradual change of the Old East Slavic vowel system

contacts with the remnants of the Scythian and Sarmatian population north of the Black Sea, lasting into the early Middle Ages, the appearance of the voiced fricative γ/г (romanized \"h\"), in modern Ukrainian and some southern Russian dialects is explained by the assumption that it initially emerged in Scythian and related eastern Iranian dialects, from earlier common Proto-Indo-European *g and *gʰ [21] [22] [23]\n\n\nDevelopments under Poland and Lithuania\nIn the 13th century, eastern parts of Rus (including Moscow) came under Tatar rule until their unification under the Tsardom of Muscovy, whereas the south-western areas (including Kyiv) were incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania For the following four centuries, the languages of the two regions evolved in relative isolation from each other Direct written evidence of the existence of the Ukrainian language dates to the late 16th century [25] By the 16th century, a peculiar official language formed: a mixture of  the liturgical standardised language of Old Church Slavonic, Ruthenian and Polish The influence of the latter gradually increased relative to the former two, as the nobility and rural large-landowning class, known as the szlachta, was largely Polish-speaking Documents soon took on many Polish characteristics superimposed on Ruthenian phonetics [26]\n\n\nChronology\nThe accepted chronology of Ukrainian divides the language into Old Ukrainian, Middle Ukrainian, and Modern Ukrainian [29] Shevelov explains that much of this is based on the character of contemporary written sources, ultimately reflecting socio-historical developments, and he further subdivides the Middle period into three phases: [30] [31] [32] [33]\n\n\nHistory of the spoken language\nThe era of Kievan Rus' (c 880–1240) is the subject of some linguistic controversy, as the language of much of the literature was purely or heavily Old Church Slavonic Some theorists [which?] see an early Ukrainian stage in language development here, calling it Old Ruthenian; others [which?] term this era Old East Slavic Russian theorists tend to amalgamate Rus' to the modern nation of Russia, and call this linguistic era Old Russian However, according to Russian linguist Andrey Zaliznyak (2012), people from the Novgorod Republic did not call themselves Rus' until the 14th century; earlier Novgorodians reserved the term Rus' for the Kiev, Pereyaslavl and Chernigov principalities [17] At the same time as evidenced by contemporary chronicles, the ruling princes and kings of Galicia–Volhynia and Kiev called themselves \"people of Rus'\" (in foreign sources called \"Ruthenians\"), [citation needed] and Galicia–Volhynia has alternately been called the Principality or Kingdom of Ruthenia [34]\n\n\nRus' and Kingdom of

Local autonomy of both rule and language was a marked feature of Lithuanian rule In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Old East Slavic became the language of the chancellery and gradually evolved into the Ruthenian language Polish rule, which came later, was accompanied by a more assimilationist policy By the 1569 Union of Lublin that formed the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, a significant part of Ukrainian territory was moved from Lithuanian rule to Polish administration, resulting in cultural Polonization and visible attempts to colonize Ukraine by the Polish nobility [35]\n\n\nSpeakers in the Russian Empire\nIn the Russian Empire Census of 1897 the following picture emerged, with Ukrainian being the second most spoken language of the Russian Empire According to the Imperial census's

to de facto banishment [citation needed]\n\n\nStalin\nAfter the death of Stalin (1953), a general policy of relaxing the language policies of the past was implemented (1958 to 1963) The Khrushchev era which followed saw a policy of relatively lenient concessions to development of the languages at the local and republic level, though its results in Ukraine did not go nearly as far as those of the Soviet policy of Ukrainianization in the 1920s Journals and encyclopedic publications advanced in the Ukrainian language during the Khrushchev era, as well as transfer of Crimea under Ukrainian SSR jurisdiction [citation needed]\n\n\nKhrushchev thaw\nAfter the death of Stalin (1953), a general policy of relaxing the language policies of the past was implemented (1958 to 1963) The Khrushchev era

promoted the beauty of the Ukrainian language and developed plans to expand the role of Ukrainian in higher education He was removed, however, after only a brief tenure, for being too lenient on Ukrainian nationalism [citation needed]\n\n\nShcherbytsky period\nThe new party boss from 1972 to 1989, Volodymyr Shcherbytsky, purged the local party, was fierce in suppressing dissent, and insisted Russian be spoken at all official functions, even at local levels His policy of Russification was lessened only slightly after 1985 [citation needed]\n\n\nGorbachev and perebudova\nThe management of dissent by the local Ukrainian Communist Party was more fierce and thorough than in other parts of the Soviet Union As a result, at the start of the Mikhail Gorbachev reforms perebudova and hlasnist’

Her contacts brought her to a new level of prominence at the end of 2008 with the investment of Middle Eastern funds in Barclays as the bank sought to recapitalize by raising money privately rather than accept a bailout from the British government following the financial crisis of that year.

National Basketball Association (NBA) for over 15 years. Born on May 6, 1985, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Paul is a 6'0\" point guard who has played for several teams, including the New Orleans Hornets, Los Angeles Clippers, Houston Rockets, Oklahoma City Thunder, Phoenix Suns, and Washington Wizards. He is a 10-time NBA All-Star, 11-time All-NBA selection, and 9-time All-Defensive selection. Paul has led the NBA in steals six times and in assists five times. He is considered one of the greatest point guards in NBA history.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nChris Paul was born to Charles Edward Paul and Robin Jones in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. His father, Charles, was a high school basketball coach, and his mother, Robin, was a school teacher. Paul grew up with his older brother, Charles \"C.J.\" Paul, in a family that valued education and athletics. The Paul brothers spent their summers working at a service station owned by their grandfather, Nathaniel Jones, where Paul attributes many life lessons to his grandfather and has described him as his \"best friend.\" Paul was raised Baptist and attended West Forsyth High School in Clemmons, North Carolina.\n\n**High School Career**\n\nPaul attended West Forsyth High School in Clemmons, North Carolina, where he played basketball and football. During his freshman and sophomore seasons, he played on the junior varsity team. For his junior year, Paul averaged 25 points, 5.3 assists, and 4.4 steals per game, helping West Forsyth reach the state semifinals. Over the ensuing summer, he led the Winston-Salem-based Kappa Magic to the National U-17 AAU title, earning tournament MVP honors. During his senior season, Paul received national attention for scoring 61 points in a game; his 61-year-old grandfather was murdered earlier that year, and Paul honored him by scoring one point for each year of his life. Paul finished the season with averages of 30.8 points, 5.9 rebounds, 9.5 assists, and 6.0 steals per game, leading West Forsyth to a 27–3 record and the Class 4A Eastern Regional finals. He was ultimately named a McDonald's All-American, first-team Parade All-American, and North Carolina's Mr Basketball by The Charlotte Observer.\n\n**College Career**\n\nAs a freshman at Wake Forest University, Paul averaged 14.8 points, 5.9 assists, and 2.7 steals per game, setting school freshman records for three-point percentage, free throws, free throw percentage, assists, and steals. Behind his play, the Demon Deacons qualified for the NCAA tournament, losing in the Sweet Sixteen to St Joseph's. At the end of the season, Paul was named ACC Rookie of the Year and Third Team All-ACC.\n\n**Professional Career**\n\n**New Orleans Hornets (2005–2011)**\n\nPaul was selected as the fourth overall pick in the 2005 NBA draft by the New Orleans Hornets. Due to the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina, the Hornets played most of their games in Oklahoma City during Paul's first two seasons with the team. Paul finished his debut season leading all rookies in total points, assists, steals, and double-doubles, and became only the second rookie in NBA history to lead the league in total steals. With final averages of 16.1 points, 5.1 rebounds, 7.8 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, he was named NBA Rookie of the Year, falling just one vote shy of winning the award unanimously.\n\n**Failed Lakers Trade and \"Lob City\" Rise (2011–2012)**\n\nOn December 8, 2011, the Hornets agreed to a three-team trade sending Paul to the Lakers. The NBA, who owned the Hornets at the time, nullified the deal because commissioner David Stern claimed that New Orleans would be better off by keeping Paul. The teams involved in the transaction attempted to lobby the league to reverse its ruling and reconstruct the deal to no avail. On December 12, the Hornets agreed to a trade sending Paul to the Los Angeles Clippers, but the deal broke down after the NBA added additional demands to the original terms. Two days later, the teams finally completed the trade, sending Paul and two future second-round draft picks to the Clippers in return for Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, Al-Farouq Aminu, and the Minnesota Timberwolves' unprotected first-round pick in the 2012 draft, which was used to draft Austin Rivers.\n\n**Playoff Upsets (2012–2015)**\n\nAt the 2013 All-Star Game, Paul led the West to victory with a 20-point and 15-assist performance, earning his first NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award. He finished the season averaging 16.9 points, 9.7 assists, and 2.4 steals per game, helping the Clippers to a franchise-record 56 wins. Seeded fourth in the West entering the playoffs, Los Angeles were defeated in the first round by the Memphis Grizzlies.

Los Angeles later denied any player involvement in the coaching decision.\n\n**Final Years with Clippers (2015–2017)**\n\nIn January of the 2015–16 season, Paul led the Clippers on a ten-game winning streak despite missing Griffin and Jordan at various points due to injury. For the third straight year, he finished the season with averages of over 19 points, 10 assists, and 2 steals per game. To begin the postseason, the Clippers drew a matchup with the Portland Trail Blazers, taking a 2–1 lead to start the series. In Game 4, Paul broke his hand and was ruled out indefinitely. Without Paul, as well as Griffin, who also injured himself in Game 4, Los Angeles eventually lost the series in six games.\n\n**Houston Rockets (2017–2019)**\n\nOn June 28, 2017, Paul was traded to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Patrick Beverley, Sam Dekker, Montrezl Harrell, Darrun Hilliard, DeAndre Liggins, Lou Williams, Kyle Wiltjer, a future first-round pick, and cash considerations. The Clippers ultimately decided to trade Paul because they were unwilling to offer him the contract extension that he was seeking and they did not want to lose him for nothing once he became a free agent. Paul, who was interested in playing alongside superstar guard James Harden, opted into the final year of his existing contract to facilitate the trade.\n\n**First Conference Finals Appearance (2017–2018)**\n\nOn June 28, 2017, Paul was traded to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Patrick Beverley, Sam Dekker, Montrezl Harrell, Darrun Hilliard, DeAndre Liggins, Lou Williams, Kyle Wiltjer, a future first-round pick, and cash considerations.

It is a day when people traditionally play practical jokes and pranks on one another, often with the intention of deceiving or misleading others. The origins of April Fools' Day are not well-documented, and there are many theories about its history.\n\n**Origins**\n\nAlthough many theories have been proposed, the exact origin of April Fools' Day is not exactly known. Some believe that it came from the ancient Roman festival of Hilaria, which was celebrated on March 25th to honor the goddess Cybele. Others believe that it was a way for people to play tricks on each other before the start of the Christian season of Lent, which began on Ash Wednesday.\n\n**Long-standing Customs**\n\nApril Fools' Day has been celebrated in various forms and cultures around the world for centuries. Here are some examples of long-standing customs associated with April Fools' Day:\n\n### **Armenia**\n\nIn Armenian culture, an April Fool prank is revealed by saying ապրիլ մեկ! (april mek) which means 1 April. This is often accompanied by a gesture of feigning injury or shock.\n\n### **Germany**\n\nIn Germany, an April Fool prank is sometimes later revealed by shouting \"April, April!\" at the recipient, who becomes the \"April fool\".\n\n### **Iran**\n\nIn Iran, it is called \"Dorugh-e Sizdah\" (lie of Thirteen) and people and media prank on 13 Farvardin (Sizdah bedar) that is equivalent of 1 April. It is a tradition that takes place 13 days after the Persian new year, Nowruz. On this day, people go out and leave their houses and have fun outside, mostly in natural parks. Pranks have reportedly been played on this holiday since 536 BC in the Achaemenid Empire.\n\n### **Ireland**\n\nIn Ireland, it was traditional to entrust the victim with an \"important letter\" to be given to a named person. That person would read the letter, then ask the victim to take it to someone else, and so on. The letter when opened contained the words \"send the fool further\".\n\n### **Italy, France, Belgium, and French-speaking areas**\n\nIn Italy, France, Belgium, and French-speaking areas of Switzerland and Canada, the 1 April tradition is often known as \"April fish\" (poisson d'avril in French, aprilvis in Dutch or pesce d'aprile in Italian). Possible pranks include attempting to attach a paper fish to the victim's back without being noticed. This fish feature is prominently present on many late 19th- to early 20th-century French April Fools' Day postcards. Many newspapers also spread a false story on April Fish Day, and a subtle reference to a fish is sometimes given as a clue to the fact that it is an April Fools' prank. Boulangeries, pâtisseries, and chocolatiers in France sell chocolate fishes in their shop windows on the day.\n\n### **Lebanon**\n\nIn Lebanon, an April Fool prank is revealed by saying كذبة أول نيسان (which translates to \"First of April Lie\") to the recipient.\n\n### **Nordic countries**\n\nDanes, Finns, Icelanders, Norwegians, and Swedes celebrate April Fools' Day (aprilsnar in Danish; aprillipäivä in Finnish; aprilsnarr in Norwegian; aprilskämt in Swedish).

April Fools' Day is called \"Nisan Balığı\" (April Fish) in Turkish. Pranks and jokes are usually verbal and are revealed by shouting \"Bir Nisan!\" / \"Nisan Bir!\" (1 April!).\n\n### **Ukraine**\n\nApril Fools' Day is widely celebrated in Odesa and has the special local name Humorina (in Ukrainian Гуморина, Humorina). This holiday arose in 1973. An April Fool prank is revealed by saying \"Перше квітня — брехня всесвітня\" (\"Pershe kvitnya — brekhnya vsesvitnya\", translating as \"First of April — worldwide lies\") to the recipient. The festival includes a large parade in the city centre, free concerts, street fairs, and performances. Festival participants dress up in a variety of costumes and walk around the city fooling around and pranking passersby. One of the traditions on April Fools' Day is to dress up the main city monument in funny clothes. Humorina even has its own logo—a cheerful sailor in a lifebelt—whose author was the artist Arkady Tsykun. During the festival, special souvenirs bearing the logo are printed and sold. Since 2010, April Fools' Day celebrations include an International Clown Festival, and both celebrated as one. In 2019, the festival was dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the Odesa Film Studio, and all events were held with an emphasis on cinema.\n\n### **United Kingdom**\n\nIn the UK, an April Fool prank is sometimes later revealed by shouting \"April fool!\" at the recipient, who becomes the \"April fool\". A study in the 1950s, by folklorists Iona and Peter Opie, found that in the UK, and in countries whose traditions derived from the UK, this continues to be the practice, with the custom ceasing at noon, after which time it is no longer acceptable to play pranks. Thus, a person playing a prank after midday is considered the \"April fool\" themselves.\n\n## **Pranks**\n\nOne common prank is to carefully remove the cream from an Oreo, then replacing it with white toothpaste, and there are many similar pranks that replace an object (usually food) with another object that looks like the object but tastes different, such as replacing sugar with salt or vanilla frosting with sour cream. As well as people playing pranks on one another on April Fools' Day, elaborate pranks have appeared on radio and television stations, newspapers, and websites, and have been performed by large corporations. In one famous prank in 1957, the BBC broadcast a film in their Panorama current affairs series purporting to show Swiss farmers picking freshly-grown spaghetti, in what they called the Swiss spaghetti harvest. The BBC was soon flooded with requests to purchase a spaghetti plant, forcing them to declare the film a hoax on the news the next day.\n\n## **Comparable Prank Days**\n\n28 December, the equivalent day in Spain and Hispanic America, is also the Christian day of celebration of the Day of the Holy Innocents. The Christian celebration is a religious holiday in its own right, but the tradition of pranks is not, though the latter is observed yearly. In some regions of Hispanic America, after a prank is played, the cry is made, \"Inocente palomita que te dejaste engañar\" (\"You innocent little dove that let yourself be fooled!\"; not to be confused with another meaning of palomita, which means \"popcorn\" in some dialects).\n\n## **First Day of a New Month**\n\nIn many English-speaking countries, mainly Britain, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, it is a custom to say \"pinch and a punch for the first of the month\" or an alternative, typically by children. The victim might respond with \"a flick and a kick for being so quick\", and the attacker might reply with \"a punch in the eye for being so sly\".\n\n## **Reception**\n\nThe practice of April Fool pranks and hoaxes is controversial. The mixed opinions of critics are epitomized in the reception to the 1957 BBC \"spaghetti-tree hoax\", in reference to which, newspapers were split over whether it was \"a great joke or a terrible hoax on the public\".\n\n## **In Popular Culture**\n\nBooks, films, telemovies, and television episodes have used April Fools' Day as their title or inspiration. Examples include Bryce Courtenay's novel April Fool's Day (1993), whose title refers to the day Courtenay's son died. The 1990s sitcom Roseanne featured an episode titled \"April Fools' Day\", which turned out to be intentionally misleading, as the episode was instead about Tax Day in the United States, occurring on 15 April. The 19th episode of the first season of SpongeBob SquarePants, \"Fools In April\", also centers around a plot that takes place on April Fools' Day.\n\n## **Minecraft**\n\nEvery year on 1 April, video game developer Mojang releases an April Fool's Day snapshot (an altered version of the game) for Minecraft: Java Edition (a version of Minecraft available on computers). Over the years, several April Fool's Day updates have been released.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* April Fools' Day\n* April Fools' Day in popular culture\n* April Fools' Day in science\n* April Fools' Day in advertising\n* April Fools' Day in politics\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* \"April Fools' Day\".

every word said on 1 April could be untrue The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with Leopold I, signed on 1 April 1683, was backdated to 31 March [21] However, for some in Poland prima April ends at noon of 1 April and prima April jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.\n\n\nSpanish-speaking countries\nIn many Spanish-speaking countries (and the Philippines), \"Día de los Santos Inocentes\" (Holy Innocents Day) is a festivity that is very similar to April Fools' Day, but is celebrated in late December (27, 28 or 29 depending on the location) [citation needed] Despite this, in Galicia April Fools' Day is also traditional, as accounted by Ramón Otero Pedrayo, as \"Día dos enganos\", and the tradition is embedded in a traditional saying about this day being the day when donkeys go where they must not go [22]\n\n\nTurkey\nTurkey also has a custom of April Fools' pranks [23] April Fools' Day is called \"Nisan Balığı\" (April Fish) in Turkish Pranks and jokes are usually verbal and are revealed by shouting \"Bir Nisan! / Nisan Bir!\" (1 April!).\n\n\nUkraine\nApril Fools' Day is widely celebrated in Odesa and has the special local name Humorina (in Ukrainian Гуморина, Humorina) This holiday arose in 1973 [24] An April Fool prank is revealed by saying \"Перше квітня — брехня всесвітня\" (\"Pershe kvitnya — brekhnya vsesvitnya\", translating as \"First of April — worldwide lies\") to the recipient The festival includes a large parade in the city centre, free concerts, street fairs and performances Festival participants dress up in a variety of costumes and walk around the city fooling around and pranking passersby One of the traditions on April Fools' Day is to dress up the main city monument in funny clothes Humorina even has its own logo—a cheerful sailor in a lifebelt—whose author was the artist Arkady Tsykun [25] During the festival, special souvenirs bearing the logo are printed and sold Since 2010, April Fools' Day celebrations include an International Clown Festival, and both celebrated as one In 2019, the festival was dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the Odesa Film Studio and all events were held with an emphasis on cinema [26]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nIn the UK, an April Fool prank is sometimes later revealed by shouting \"April fool!\" at the recipient, who becomes the \"April fool\" A study in the 1950s, by folklorists Iona and Peter Opie, found that in the UK, and in countries whose traditions derived from the UK, this continues to be the practice, with the custom ceasing at noon, after which time it is no longer acceptable to play pranks [27] Thus a person playing a prank after midday is considered the \"April fool\" themselves [28]\n\n\nPranks\nOne common prank is to carefully remove the cream from an Oreo, then replacing it with white toothpaste, and there are many similar pranks that replace an object (usually food) with another object that looks like the object but tastes different such as replacing sugar with salt or vanilla frosting with sour cream As well as people playing pranks on one another on April Fools' Day, elaborate pranks have appeared on radio and television stations, newspapers, and websites, and have been performed by large corporations In one famous prank in 1957, the BBC broadcast a film in their Panorama current affairs series purporting to show Swiss farmers picking freshly-grown spaghetti, in what they called the Swiss spaghetti harvest The BBC was soon flooded with requests to purchase a spaghetti plant, forcing them to declare the film a hoax on the news the next day [30]\n\n\nComparable prank days\n28 December, the equivalent day in Spain [32] and Hispanic America, [33] [34] is also the Christian day of celebration of the Day of the Holy Innocents The Christian celebration is a religious holiday in its own right, but the tradition of pranks is not, though the latter is observed yearly In some regions of Hispanic America after a prank is played, the cry is made, \"Inocente palomita que te dejaste engañar\" (\"You innocent little dove that let yourself be fooled!\";

species as the Star Wars character Yoda, [10] [11] he is 50 years old during the events of The Mandalorian \"Chapter 1: The Mandalorian\", but still appears to be an infant because of the pace at which that species matures [12] [13] [14] The species has never been given a proper name because Star Wars creator George Lucas wanted Yoda to maintain a sense of mystery [2] [4] [15] Until Chapter 13 (i.e episode 5 of season 2) of The Mandalorian, Grogu was not identified by a proper name, being referred to by sympathetic characters as \"the child\", \"the kid\", or \"the baby\", and by the antagonists as \"the asset\", \"the bounty\", \"the target\", or \"the donor\" [11] [16]\n\n\nSeason 1\nGrogu first appears in the series debut, \"Chapter 1: The Mandalorian\", when the Mandalorian accepts a valuable commission from a mysterious man known only as \"The Client\" (Werner Herzog), who works for a remnant of the now-fallen Galactic Empire The assignment is to track down and capture an unidentified fifty-year-old target [17] [18] [19] The Mandalorian and a fellow bounty hunter droid, IG-11 (Taika Waititi), infiltrate a remote and heavily defended encampment on the planet Arvala-7 and find Grogu When IG-11 attempts to kill Grogu, the Mandalorian protects him and instead shoots and destroys IG-11 [19] [20] [21] In \"Chapter 2: The Child\", Grogu is present when the Mandalorian is attacked by a giant rhinoceros-like creature called a mudhorn As the beast rushes toward the Mandalorian for the kill, Grogu uses the Force to levitate the mudhorn, allowing a surprised Mandalorian to kill it [22] [23] [24] The Mandalorian delivers Grogu to the Client on the planet Nevarro and collects his bounty in \"Chapter 3: The Sin\", after which the Client orders his colleague, Dr Pershing (Omid Abtahi), to \"extract the necessary material\" from Grogu [25] [26] The Mandalorian later has second thoughts and returns to the Imperial compound to rescue Grogu, killing multiple stormtroopers [27] [28] This violates the code of the Bounty Hunters' Guild, and a group of bounty hunters led by guild leader Greef Karga (Carl Weathers) ambush the Mandalorian and attempt to take Grogu back from him [29] [30] [31] The Mandalorian and Grogu are saved when fellow warriors from the Mandalorian's tribe come out of hiding to defend them, allowing them to escape Nevarro [25] [31]\n\n\nSeason 2\nGrogu accompanies the Mandalorian during his search for other Mandalorians who could help him find the child's people: the Jedi In \"Chapter 9: The Marshal\", the pair return to Tatooine and meet Cobb Vanth (Timothy Olyphant), the Marshal of Mos Pelgo, who is not a true Mandalorian but wears Mandalorian armor The Mandalorian helps Vanth slay a krayt dragon which had been attacking Mos Pelgo, in exchange for his armor Along the way the pair arrange an uneasy alliance between the townspeople and a Tusken Raider tribe The Mandalorian developed a deep respect for Vanth, to the point he entrusts him to look after Grogu, should he perish during his attempt to kill the dragon In \"Chapter 10: The Passenger\", the Mandalorian and Grogu leave for Trask, where they must take a contact, \"Frog Lady\" (Misty Rosas, voiced by Dee Bradley Baker), and her eggs in exchange for a lead on other Mandalorians During their journey, Grogu takes a liking to the eggs and eats a few of them despite being explicitly forbidden from doing so by the Mandalorian Grogu's appetite also gets the group into trouble while stranded on Maldo Kreis, where he eats a spider-like creature's egg just as the rest of the swarm hatches They are ultimately saved from the swarm by two X-wing pilots (Dave Filoni and Paul Sun-Hyung Lee) from the New Republic In \"Chapter 11: The Heiress\", the group arrives on Trask and after bringing Frog Lady and her remaining eggs to her husband, the Mandalorian and Grogu encounter Bo-Katan Kryze (Katee Sackhoff) and two other Mandalorian warriors, who save them from a crew of Quarrens who wish to kill Grogu and steal the Mandalorian's armor While the Mandalorian accompanies Bo-Katan's team on a mission in exchange for a lead on Jedi, Grogu is left with the Frog Man and Frog Lady, during which time the eggs hatch and Grogu bonds with the newborn tadpoles.\n\n\nThe Book of Boba Fett\nGrogu appears in the sixth episode, \"Chapter 6: From the Desert Comes a Stranger\", of the spin-off series The Book of Boba Fett While training with Luke, he helps Grogu remember some of his past, including his home at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant and the events of the Great Jedi Purge The Mandalorian comes to visit Grogu, but decides against it after speaking with Ahsoka Tano, not wanting to hinder his training; however, he gives Ahsoka a gift to deliver to Grogu: beskar chain mail forged by the Armorer Ahsoka gives the chain mail to Luke, who confesses that he is unsure whether Grogu is fully committed to the Jedi path and that he does not know how to handle the matter Following Ahsoka's advice to listen to his instincts, Luke decides to let Grogu choose his destiny by asking him to choose between the chain mail and the lightsaber of his old master, Yoda [59]\n\n\nSeason 3\nGrogu accompanies the Mandalorian on his travels as he attempts to atone for breaking the Creed by removing his helmet In \"Chapter 17: The Apostate\", the Mandalorian has IG-11 partially repaired as a prospective companion, but IG-11 defaults to his original programming and attempts to kill Grogu before once again being destroyed In \"Chapter 18: The Mines of Mandalore\", Pelli Motto sells R5-D4 to the Mandalorian and the three travel to Mandalore When the Mandalorian is captured by a cyborg in the mines, Grogu flies with R5 in the N-1 to Kalevala to fetch Bo-Katan to rescue the captured Mandalorian After the rescue, Bo-Katan leads Grogu and the Mandalorian to the Living Waters and Grogu witnesses the Mandalorian bathe himself In \"Chapter 19: The Convert\", the trio are attacked by Imperial starfighters in Kalevala, forcing them to flee to the Mandalorian's convert, where Grogu witnesses the Mandalorian's redemption and Bo-Katan's induction.\n\n\nFuture\nAt Disney's first quarter 2024 earnings call, CEO Bob Iger announced that a new Star Wars movie was being developed \"that brings the Mandalorian and Grogu to the big screen for the very first time.\" [62]\n\n\nCharacterization\nPhysically, Grogu closely resembles Yoda, sharing his signature green skin and long, pointed ears [63] Grogu is small in size, with wide eyes, short hairs, and wrinkled skin [64] [65] Grogu is capable of sitting up, crawling, walking, and eating He appears capable of understanding some language spoken around him, but cannot speak except in baby-like babble noises [66] Anthony Breznican of Vanity Fair stated: \"There is an emotional transference happening here The audience cares more about the unnamed, faceless Mandalorian because he cares so much about Baby Yoda.\" [67] Rebecca Keegan of The Hollywood Reporter believes Grogu displays a form of wisdom despite his young age, describing him as \"a Dalai Lama in toddler form\" [5] Jeanne Cavelos, former NASA astrophysicist and author of The Science of Star Wars, also believes Grogu demonstrates intelligence beyond his years, noting his awareness and empathy toward beings even when their faces or bodies are covered completely, as well as his ability to recognize injury in others and attempt to repair it [66]\n\n\nConcept and creation\nGrogu was conceived by Jon Favreau, the creator and showrunner of The Mandalorian [10] Upon learning that Lucasfilm had been sold to the Walt Disney Company in 2012, Favreau began imagining working on a Star Wars project, and was particularly interested in exploring the events after the original Star Wars trilogy [5] He conceived Grogu based upon a desire to explore the mystery around Yoda and his species, [10] and an interest in presenting a character from Yoda's species at the beginning of his journey, in contrast to Yoda ending his own journey in Return of the Jedi (1983) [5] Favreau believed part of the appeal of Yoda was that George Lucas deliberately kept his origins and details about the species mysterious, and Favreau believed that sense of mystery would extend to Grogu: \"I think that's why people are so curious about this little one of the same species.\" [10] [75]\n\n\nConception\nGrogu was conceived by Jon Favreau, the creator and showrunner of The Mandalorian [10] Upon learning that Lucasfilm had been sold to the Walt

believed that sense of mystery would extend to Grogu: \"I think that's why people are so curious about this little one of the same species.\" [10] [75]\n\n\nDevelopment\nGrogu is mostly a work of animatronics and puppetry, although accentuated with computer-generated imagery (CGI) [10] Legacy Effects, the special effects studio started by protégés of special make-up effects creator Stan Winston, designed the Grogu puppet and supplied the puppeteers to animate it during filming [77] [78] The puppet cost about $5 million to make, [1] and is relatively heavy due to the amount of wires and animatronic technology inside it [79] It is controlled by two technicians, one who operates the eyes and mouth and another who controls other facial expressions [16] [80] There are several stand-in versions for Grogu used in filming in addition to the primary puppet [81] The crew of The Mandalorian wanted to use animatronics for Grogu as often as possible [82] However, they also shot versions of the character's scenes both with and without the puppet, so they had the option of replacing it with a CGI effect in post-production if the puppet did not look satisfactory [82] [83] When CGI is used, Favreau said they try to make the character obey the same physical laws that he would if he were a puppet, adding: \"I think a lot of times CG makes itself too obvious where you don't create parameters creatively that allow the character to keep the same identity and charm.\" [10]\n\n\nFilming\nThe character was referred to as \"the Child\" in screenplays for The Mandalorian, though Bryce Dallas Howard, who directed \"Chapter 4: Sanctuary\", said she always referred to him on set simply as \"Baby\", [77] and other cast members called it \"The Being\" [15] During filming, the director of each episode would communicate with Grogu's puppeteers to discuss what was happening in the scene, what emotions Grogu should express, and what actions the character should take [16] [67] Director Deborah Chow said in this way, it was similar to providing direction to a living actor [67] [87] Favreau encouraged the directors to test and push the boundaries of the Grogu puppet during filming, urging them to experiment and attempt to get the most realistic movements and mannerisms possible from the character [77] Brendan Wayne, a body double for the Mandalorian character, said the puppet looked so realistic that performing against it felt like working with an actual child actor [78] Rick Famuyiwa, the director of \"Chapter 2: The Child\", said he was shocked when he learned that the premiere episode of The Mandalorian ended with the introduction of Grogu, because it meant he would be directing the next episode that further expanded upon the character [82]\n\n\nPrerelease\nGrogu was kept secret and was deliberately withheld from The Mandalorian's prerelease marketing and merchandise plans due to the risk that details about the character could leak before the show aired [10] [5] [110] [111] Favreau said of this plan: \"I think that part of what people really value is to be surprised and delighted, and I think that's becoming all too rare.\" [10] Favreau has credited Donald Glover as the source of that strategy While developing The Mandalorian, Favreau was simultaneously directing Glover in the 2019 photorealistic remake of The Lion King (1994) While discussing music and pop culture, Glover told Favreau that people enjoy being surprised, because true surprises had become much less common in the Internet era As an example, Glover cited the excitement generated by the sudden releases of surprise albums by singer and songwriter Beyoncé [5] [112] Favreau felt keeping Grogu a secret until he was revealed would allow fans to connect with the character and \"discover the story as it was unfolding\" The leadership and marketing team at the Walt Disney Company was supportive of this strategy [10] Screeners of the pilot episode were not distributed to reviewers to avoid leaks about Grogu, [113] and the official Lucasfilm and Star Wars social media accounts did not start posting messages about Grogu until about a week after the series debuted, to avoid spoiling the character's debut as much as possible [113] [114] [115]\n\n\nThemes\nOne of the primary themes of The Mandalorian is parenting and fatherhood, particularly through the father-son relationship dynamic between the Mandalorian and Grogu [116] [117] [118] Ryan Britt of Fatherly wrote: \"For years the Star Wars franchise avoided depicting a parent-child dynamic With Mando and Baby Yoda, that’s finally changing.\" [116] Vulture writer Kathryn VanArendonk argued that parenting has been the subject of past Star Wars stories, but almost always during later stages of parenthood, rather than an infant in early developmental stages such as Grogu As examples, she cited Obi-Wan Kenobi serving as a mentor to the adolescent Anakin Skywalker, Princess Leia lamenting over her grown son Kylo Ren, or the absence of Rey's parents [119] Several reviewers have compared the dynamic between Grogu and the Mandalorian to Lone Wolf and Cub, a manga about a samurai warrior and his young son [120] [121] [122] [123] Grogu makes the Mandalorian a softer and more relatable character; [12] [124] he changes in a positive way because of raising Grogu, becoming less selfish and self-absorbed [125] Several examples of the Mandalorian parenting Grogu appear throughout the series, such as when he stops Grogu from pressing random buttons in the cockpit of the Mandalorian's spaceship, ultimately by holding him in his lap [116] In another example, the Mandalorian sets up a car seat for Grogu in the cockpit of his ship, so he can be seated safely and comfortably during their travels [126]\n\n\nParenting and fatherhood\nOne of the primary themes of The Mandalorian is parenting and fatherhood, particularly through the father-son relationship dynamic between the

[116] In another example, the Mandalorian sets up a car seat for Grogu in the cockpit of his ship, so he can be seated safely and comfortably during their travels [126]\n\n\nGood and evil; nature versus nurture\nOne scene in \"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\" led many fans to reevaluate Grogu and question whether he may demonstrate evil tendencies During a scene on the Mandalorian's spaceship, Grogu observes as the Mandalorian and Cara Dune engage in a friendly arm wrestling match During the contest, Grogu uses the Force to choke Cara, nearly strangling her to death before the Mandalorian intervenes [72] [73] [74] Throughout the Star Wars franchise, that ability has been most commonly associated with the dark side of the Force, and particularly with the antagonist character Darth Vader [128] [129] Sarah Bea Milner of Screen Rant wrote: \"The moment is genuinely shocking — and more than a little disturbing.\" [128] Some reviewers noted, however, that Grogu likely mistakenly believed the Mandalorian was in danger and intervened to help [129] [130] Additionally, in the same episode, Grogu uses the Force to heal and save Greef Karga, a power typically associated with the Light Side [128] [72] [130] Peter Foy of Comic Book Resources wrote: \"It doesn't exactly seem realistic that Disney would blow its merchandising potential with the little cutie by going all Damien (The Omen) in his storyline.\" [72]\n\n\nCultural impact\nGrogu has received a positive reception from fans and reviewers, [4] [67] and is widely considered the show's breakout character [2] [3] [132] [133] Fans immediately adopted the nickname \"Baby Yoda\" to describe the character, [11] [134] [135] a moniker Favreau has embraced as \"the easiest, shortest, most hashtagable way to identify that character\" [11] However, the nickname is not used internally by the crew of The Mandalorian, and Disney CEO Bob Iger said he \"got  [his] wrist slapped\" by Favreau for calling the character Baby Yoda in e-mail messages [136] [137] Iger later said the scale of the positive reaction to Grogu was \"beyond my expectations by a wide margin\" [138] [139]\n\n\nCritical reception\nGrogu has received a positive

reaction to Grogu was \"beyond my expectations by a wide margin\" [138] [139]\n\n\nInternet memes\nGrogu quickly became a popular Internet meme [134] [151] [152] In the week following the debut of The Mandalorian, Grogu was driving almost twice as many social media interactions on news stories about it as any of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates [10] [153] [154] The Baby Yoda search term saw continuous growth on Google Trends in the weeks following the release of The Mandalorian [64] There were 2.28 million social media interactions about the characters on news stories in the first two weeks after the release of The Mandalorian, [154] and two million tweets featuring the words \"Baby Yoda\" were sent on Twitter between November 12 and December 5, 2019 [64] When Favreau tweeted a concept art image of the character by artist Christian Alzmann on November 19, it received more than 34,000 retweets and 217,000 likes within one week [67] Various celebrities have tweeted about the character, including Ariana Grande, [64] Elon Musk, [155] Dwayne Johnson, Russell Wilson, Alex Rodriguez, [151] and Donald Trump Jr [156] Zach Vasquez of The Guardian wrote: \"It's now practically impossible to scroll through any social media platform without being inundated with pics, videos, memes and gifs of the bug-eyed, big-eared tot.\" [4] The Los Angeles Times included Grogu in its list of \"2019's Internet Obsessions\", with writer Christie D'Zurilla writing: \"Baby Yoda won the Internet in 2019.\" [155]\n\n\nCultural references\nIn December 2019, artwork of Disney CEO Bob Iger with Grogu appeared in the Time magazine article naming Iger their Businessperson of the Year [166] The New Yorker published a cartoon of a woman pushing a baby stroller and saying to the baby inside it: \"No offense, but Baby Yoda, like, blows you out of the water.\" [67] Ice2Ice, a musician associated with the website The Ringer, released \"Dear Baby Yoda: A Love Song\" on December 3, 2019, with the music based upon the song \"Dear Theodosia\" from the musical Hamilton [167] [168] [169] The character was also mentioned in the December 2019 South Park episode \"Basic Cable\" In the episode, a character named Scott Malkinson attempts to get Disney+ because the woman he is interested in loves Grogu, so he believes she will love him too if he gets the streaming service [170] Grogu was also parodied multiple times on Saturday Night Live's Weekend Update segment by comedian Kyle Mooney, starting on the December 14, 2019 episode, in which he gossiped about the Mandalorian cast, talked about his future business ventures, and threatened Baby Groot [171] [172] At the 77th Golden Globe Awards, host Ricky Gervais jokingly mistook Joe Pesci for \"Baby Yoda\" [173] On February 20, the United States Army revealed that a M1 Abrams tank belonging to the 3rd Infantry Division of Fort Stewart in Georgia had been named after Grogu, with the words \"BABY YODA\" printed on the barrel of its gun [174] [175] Some critics have noted that other media companies introduced young versions of their own characters following the debut of Grogu, and suggested they could be attempts to capitalize on Grogu's success As an example, Ashley Carman of The Verge cited \"Baby Sonic\", a young version of the video game character Sonic the Hedgehog who appears in his 2020 film, which she described as \"like something ripped out of Disney's playbook\" [176]\n\n\nMerchandise\nI think that part of what people really value is to be surprised and delighted, and I think that's becoming all too rare It's very difficult to keep secrets about projects you're working on By holding back on that one product, we knew that we may have had the disadvantage of not having toys available day and date, but what we got in exchange was an excitement surrounding the character, because everybody felt like they discovered him together.\n\n\nIn video games\nIn March 2020, an unofficial user-created mod for the video game Star Wars Battlefront II allowed the character BB-8 to be replaced with a playable version of Grogu [196] [197] [198] Grogu appears in Fortnite Battle Royale as a pet that floats in the hover-pram behind the player in-game [199] A non-playable Grogu is included as part of The Mandalorian: Season 1 character DLC for the 2022 video game Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, accompanying Din Djarin in a floating pod that closes to protect Grogu when attacked [200]\n\n\nIn science\nIn 2021, Grogu's likeness was published in scientific literature, in a medical journal article titled, \"Baby Yoda: Pareidolia and Patternicity in Sacral MRI and CT Scans\" [201] The lead author was Patrick Foye, M.D., a professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Rutgers University In this article, he introduced a novel way of visualizing the sacrum when viewing MRI and CT scans He noted that in certain image slices the human sacral anatomy resembles the face of \"Baby Yoda\" Sacral openings for exiting nerves (sacral foramina) resemble Baby Yoda's eyes, while the sacral canal resembles Baby Yoda's mouth These and other comparisons can help physicians to use the \"Baby Yoda sign\" to evaluate both normal and abnormal anatomic findings on the imaging studies [202]\n\n\nRelationships\n\n\nMentorship tree\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nWorks

Favreau. He is a member of the same species as the Star Wars character Yoda and is widely known as \"Baby Yoda\".\n\n**Introduction**\n\nGrogu, also referred to as \"the Child\" or \"Baby Yoda\", is a central character in The Mandalorian, a live-action series set in the Star Wars universe. He is a member of the same species as Yoda, a wise and powerful Jedi Master. Grogu's species has never been given a proper name in the Star Wars universe, as creator George Lucas wanted to maintain a sense of mystery surrounding them. Grogu's age is 50 years old during the events of The Mandalorian, but he appears to be an infant due to the slow aging process of his species.\n\n**Season 1**\n\nGrogu first appears in the series debut, \"Chapter 1: The Mandalorian\", when the Mandalorian accepts a valuable commission from a mysterious man known as \"The Client\" (Werner Herzog). The assignment is to track down and capture an unidentified 50-year-old target. The Mandalorian and a fellow bounty hunter droid, IG-11 (Taika Waititi), infiltrate a remote and heavily defended encampment on the planet Arvala-7 and find Grogu. When IG-11 attempts to kill Grogu, the Mandalorian protects him and instead shoots and destroys IG-11.\n\n**Season 2**\n\nIn \"Chapter 9: The Marshal\", the Mandalorian and Grogu return to Tatooine and meet Cobb Vanth (Timothy Olyphant), the Marshal of Mos Pelgo. The Mandalorian helps Vanth slay a krayt dragon that had been attacking Mos Pelgo, in exchange for his armor. The pair also arrange an uneasy alliance between the townspeople and a Tusken Raider tribe. Grogu takes a liking to the eggs of a Frog Lady (Misty Rosas) and eats a few of them despite being explicitly forbidden from doing so by the Mandalorian.

During a scene on the Mandalorian's spaceship, Grogu observes as the Mandalorian and Cara Dune engage in a friendly arm wrestling match. Grogu uses the Force to choke Cara, nearly strangling her to death before the Mandalorian intervenes. Some reviewers noted that Grogu likely mistakenly believed the Mandalorian was in danger and intervened to help.\n\n**Cultural Impact**\n\nGrogu has received a positive reception from fans and reviewers, and is widely considered the show's breakout character. Fans immediately adopted the nickname \"Baby Yoda\" to describe the character. The nickname is not used internally by the crew of The Mandalorian, but Disney CEO Bob Iger said he \"got his wrist slapped\" by Favreau for calling the character Baby Yoda in e-mail messages. Iger later said the scale of the positive reaction to Grogu was \"beyond my expectations by a wide margin\".\n\n**Internet Memes**\n\nGrogu quickly became a popular Internet meme. In the week following the debut of The Mandalorian, Grogu was driving almost twice as many social media interactions on news stories about it as any of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. The Baby Yoda search term saw continuous growth on Google Trends in the weeks following the release of The Mandalorian.\n\n**Cultural References**\n\nGrogu's likeness was published in scientific literature in a medical journal article titled, \"Baby Yoda: Pareidolia and Patternicity in Sacral MRI and CT Scans\". The lead author was Patrick Foye, M.D., a professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Rutgers University. In this article, he introduced a novel way of visualizing the sacrum when viewing MRI and CT scans.\n\n**Relationships**\n\nGrogu's relationships with other characters in The Mandalorian are central to the show's storylines. He is cared for by the Mandalorian and other characters, and he is often in danger due to his unique abilities and his connection to the Force.\n\n**Mentorship Tree**\n\nGrogu's mentorship tree is a complex network of relationships with other characters in The Mandalorian. The Mandalorian is his primary caregiver and mentor, and he also has relationships with other characters such as Ahsoka Tano and Bo-Katan Kryze.\n\n**Works Cited**\n\n* \"The Mandalorian\" (TV series).

member of the same species as the Star Wars character Yoda, [10] [11] he is 50 years old during the events of The Mandalorian \"Chapter 1: The Mandalorian\", but still appears to be an infant because of the pace at which that species matures [12] [13] [14] The species has never been given a proper name because Star Wars creator George Lucas wanted Yoda to maintain a sense of mystery [2] [4] [15]

and by the antagonists as \"the asset\", \"the bounty\", \"the target\", or \"the donor\" [11] [16]\n\n\nSeason 1\nGrogu first appears in the series debut, \"Chapter 1: The Mandalorian\", when the Mandalorian accepts a valuable commission from a mysterious man known only as \"The Client\" (Werner Herzog), who works for a remnant of the now-fallen Galactic Empire The assignment is to track down and capture an unidentified fifty-year-old target [17] [18] [19] The Mandalorian and a fellow bounty hunter droid, IG-11 (Taika Waititi), infiltrate a remote and heavily defended encampment on the planet Arvala-7 and find Grogu When IG-11 attempts to kill Grogu, the Mandalorian protects him and instead shoots and destroys IG-11 [19] [20] [21] In \"Chapter 2: The Child\", Grogu is present when the Mandalorian is attacked by a giant rhinoceros-like creature called a mudhorn As the beast rushes toward the Mandalorian for the kill, Grogu uses the Force to levitate the mudhorn, allowing a surprised Mandalorian to kill it [22] [23] [24] The Mandalorian delivers Grogu to the Client on the planet Nevarro and collects his bounty in \"Chapter 3: The Sin\", after which the Client orders his colleague, Dr Pershing (Omid Abtahi), to \"extract the necessary material\" from Grogu [25] [26] The Mandalorian later has second thoughts and returns to the Imperial compound to rescue Grogu, killing multiple stormtroopers [27] [28] This violates the code of the Bounty Hunters' Guild, and a group of bounty hunters led by guild leader Greef Karga (Carl Weathers) ambush the Mandalorian and attempt to take Grogu back from him [29] [30] [31] The Mandalorian and Grogu are saved when fellow warriors from the Mandalorian's tribe come out of hiding to defend them, allowing them to escape Nevarro [25] [31]\n\n\nSeason 2\nGrogu accompanies the Mandalorian during his search for other Mandalorians who could help him find the child's people: the Jedi In \"Chapter 9: The Marshal\", the pair return to Tatooine and meet Cobb Vanth (Timothy Olyphant), the Marshal of Mos Pelgo, who is not a true Mandalorian but wears Mandalorian armor The Mandalorian helps Vanth slay a krayt dragon which had been attacking Mos Pelgo, in exchange for his armor Along the way the pair arrange an uneasy alliance between the townspeople and a Tusken Raider tribe The Mandalorian developed a deep respect for Vanth, to the point he entrusts him to look after Grogu, should he perish during his attempt to kill the dragon In \"Chapter 10: The Passenger\", the Mandalorian and Grogu leave for Trask, where they must take a contact, \"Frog Lady\" (Misty Rosas, voiced by Dee Bradley Baker), and her eggs in exchange for a lead on other Mandalorians During their journey, Grogu takes a liking to the eggs and eats a few of them despite being explicitly forbidden from doing so by the Mandalorian Grogu's appetite also gets the group into trouble while stranded on Maldo Kreis, where he eats a spider-like creature's egg just as the rest of the swarm hatches They are ultimately saved from the swarm by two X-wing pilots (Dave Filoni and Paul Sun-Hyung Lee) from the New Republic In \"Chapter 11: The Heiress\", the group arrives on Trask and after bringing Frog Lady and her remaining eggs to her husband, the Mandalorian and Grogu encounter Bo-Katan Kryze (Katee Sackhoff) and two other Mandalorian warriors, who save them from a crew of Quarrens who wish to kill Grogu and steal the Mandalorian's armor While the Mandalorian accompanies Bo-Katan's team on a mission in exchange for a lead on Jedi, Grogu is left with the Frog Man and Frog Lady, during which time the eggs hatch and Grogu bonds with the newborn tadpoles.\n\n\nThe Book of Boba Fett\nGrogu appears in the sixth episode, \"Chapter 6: From the Desert Comes a Stranger\", of the spin-off series The Book of Boba Fett While training with Luke, he helps Grogu remember some of his past, including his home at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant and the events of the Great Jedi Purge The Mandalorian comes to visit Grogu, but decides against it after speaking with Ahsoka Tano, not wanting to hinder his training; however, he gives Ahsoka a gift to deliver to Grogu: beskar chain mail forged by the Armorer Ahsoka gives the chain mail to Luke, who confesses that he is unsure whether Grogu is fully committed to the Jedi path and that he does not know how to handle the matter Following Ahsoka's advice to listen to his instincts, Luke decides to let Grogu choose his destiny by asking him to choose between the chain mail and the lightsaber of his old master, Yoda [59]\n\n\nSeason 3\nGrogu accompanies the Mandalorian on his travels as he attempts to atone for breaking the Creed by removing his helmet In \"Chapter 17: The Apostate\", the Mandalorian has IG-11 partially repaired as a prospective companion, but IG-11 defaults to his original programming and attempts to kill Grogu before once again being destroyed In \"Chapter 18: The Mines of Mandalore\", Pelli Motto sells R5-D4 to the Mandalorian and the three travel to Mandalore When the Mandalorian is captured by a cyborg in the mines, Grogu flies with R5 in the N-1 to Kalevala to fetch Bo-Katan to rescue the captured Mandalorian After the rescue, Bo-Katan leads Grogu and the Mandalorian to the Living Waters and Grogu witnesses the Mandalorian bathe himself In \"Chapter 19: The Convert\", the trio are attacked by Imperial starfighters in Kalevala, forcing them to flee to the Mandalorian's convert, where Grogu witnesses the Mandalorian's redemption and Bo-Katan's induction.\n\n\nFuture\nAt Disney's first quarter 2024 earnings call, CEO Bob Iger announced that a new Star Wars movie was being developed \"that brings the Mandalorian and Grogu to the big screen for the very first time.\" [62]\n\n\nCharacterization\nPhysically, Grogu closely resembles Yoda, sharing his signature green skin and long, pointed ears [63] Grogu is small in size, with wide eyes, short hairs, and wrinkled skin [64] [65] Grogu is capable of sitting up, crawling, walking, and eating He appears capable of understanding some language spoken around him, but cannot speak except in baby-like babble noises [66] Anthony Breznican of Vanity Fair stated: \"There is an emotional transference happening here The audience cares more about the unnamed, faceless Mandalorian because he cares so much about Baby Yoda.\" [67] Rebecca Keegan of The Hollywood Reporter believes Grogu displays a form of wisdom despite his young age, describing him as \"a Dalai Lama in toddler form\" [5] Jeanne Cavelos, former NASA astrophysicist and author of The Science of Star Wars, also believes Grogu demonstrates intelligence beyond his years, noting his awareness and empathy toward beings even when their faces or bodies are covered completely, as well as his ability to recognize injury in others and attempt to repair it [66]\n\n\nConcept and creation\nGrogu was conceived by Jon Favreau, the creator and showrunner of The Mandalorian [10] Upon learning that Lucasfilm had been sold to the Walt Disney Company in 2012, Favreau began imagining working on a Star Wars project, and was particularly interested in exploring the events after the original Star Wars trilogy [5] He conceived Grogu based upon a desire to explore the mystery around Yoda and his species, [10] and an interest in presenting a character from Yoda's species at the beginning of his journey, in contrast to Yoda ending his own journey in Return of the Jedi (1983) [5] Favreau believed part of the appeal of Yoda was that George Lucas deliberately kept his origins and details about the species mysterious, and Favreau believed that sense of mystery would extend to Grogu: \"I think that's why people are so curious about this little one of the same species.\" [10] [75]\n\n\nConception\nGrogu was conceived by Jon Favreau, the creator and showrunner of The Mandalorian [10] Upon learning that Lucasfilm had

mysterious, and Favreau believed that sense of mystery would extend to Grogu: \"I think that's why people are so curious about this little one of the same species.\" [10] [75]\n\n\nDevelopment\nGrogu is mostly a work of animatronics and puppetry, although accentuated with computer-generated imagery (CGI) [10] Legacy Effects, the special effects studio started by protégés of special make-up effects creator Stan Winston, designed the Grogu puppet and supplied the puppeteers to animate it during filming [77] [78] The puppet cost about $5 million to make, [1] and is relatively heavy due to the amount of wires and animatronic technology inside it [79] It is controlled by two technicians, one who operates the eyes and mouth and another who controls other facial expressions [16] [80] There are several stand-in versions for Grogu used in filming in addition to the primary puppet [81] The crew of The Mandalorian wanted to use animatronics for Grogu as often as possible [82] However, they also shot versions of the character's scenes both with and without the puppet, so they had the option of replacing it with a CGI effect in post-production if the puppet did not look satisfactory [82] [83] When CGI is used, Favreau said they try to make the character obey the same physical laws that he would if he were a puppet, adding: \"I think a lot of times CG makes itself too obvious where you don't create parameters creatively that allow the character to keep the same identity and charm.\" [10]\n\n\nFilming\nThe character was referred to as \"the Child\" in screenplays for The Mandalorian, though Bryce Dallas Howard, who directed \"Chapter 4: Sanctuary\", said she always referred to him on set simply as \"Baby\", [77] and other cast members called it \"The Being\" [15] During filming, the director of each episode would communicate with Grogu's puppeteers to discuss what was happening in the scene, what emotions Grogu should express, and what actions the character should take [16] [67] Director Deborah Chow said in this way, it was similar to providing direction to a living actor [67] [87] Favreau encouraged the directors to test and push the boundaries of the Grogu puppet during filming, urging them to experiment and attempt to get the most realistic movements and mannerisms possible from the character [77] Brendan Wayne, a body double for the Mandalorian character, said the puppet looked so realistic that performing against it felt like working with an actual child actor [78] Rick Famuyiwa, the director of \"Chapter 2: The Child\", said he was shocked when he learned that the premiere episode of The Mandalorian ended with the introduction of Grogu, because it meant he would be directing the next episode that further expanded upon the character [82]\n\n\nPrerelease\nGrogu was kept secret and was deliberately withheld from The Mandalorian's prerelease marketing and merchandise plans due to the risk that details about the character could leak before the show aired [10] [5] [110] [111] Favreau said of this plan: \"I think that part of what people really value is to be surprised and delighted, and I think that's becoming all too rare.\" [10] Favreau has credited Donald Glover as the source of that strategy While developing The Mandalorian, Favreau was simultaneously directing Glover in the 2019 photorealistic remake of The Lion King (1994) While discussing music and pop culture, Glover told Favreau that people enjoy being surprised, because true surprises had become much less common in the Internet era As an example, Glover cited the excitement generated by the sudden releases of surprise albums by singer and songwriter Beyoncé [5] [112] Favreau felt keeping Grogu a secret until he was revealed would allow fans to connect with the character and \"discover the story as it was unfolding\" The leadership and marketing team at the Walt Disney Company was supportive of this strategy [10] Screeners of the pilot episode were not distributed to reviewers to avoid leaks about Grogu, [113] and the official Lucasfilm and Star Wars social media accounts did not start posting messages about Grogu until about a week after the series debuted, to avoid spoiling the character's debut as much as possible [113] [114] [115]\n\n\nThemes\nOne of the primary themes of The Mandalorian is parenting and fatherhood, particularly through the father-son relationship dynamic between the Mandalorian and Grogu [116] [117] [118] Ryan Britt of Fatherly wrote: \"For years the Star Wars franchise avoided depicting a parent-child dynamic With Mando and Baby Yoda, that’s finally changing.\" [116] Vulture writer Kathryn VanArendonk argued that parenting has been the subject of past Star Wars stories, but almost always during later stages of parenthood, rather than an infant in early developmental stages such as Grogu As examples, she cited Obi-Wan Kenobi serving as a mentor to the adolescent Anakin Skywalker, Princess Leia lamenting over her grown son Kylo Ren, or the absence of Rey's parents [119] Several reviewers have compared the dynamic between Grogu and the Mandalorian to Lone Wolf and Cub, a manga about a samurai warrior and his young son [120] [121] [122] [123] Grogu makes the Mandalorian a softer and more relatable character; [12] [124] he changes in a positive way because of raising Grogu, becoming less selfish and self-absorbed [125] Several examples of the Mandalorian parenting Grogu appear throughout the series, such as when he stops Grogu from pressing random buttons in the cockpit of the Mandalorian's spaceship, ultimately by holding him in his lap [116] In another example, the Mandalorian sets up a car seat for Grogu in the cockpit of his ship, so he can be seated safely and comfortably during their travels [126]\n\n\nParenting and fatherhood\nOne of the primary themes of The Mandalorian is parenting and fatherhood, particularly through the father-son relationship dynamic between the

versus nurture\nOne scene in \"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\" led many fans to reevaluate Grogu and question whether he may demonstrate evil tendencies During a scene on the Mandalorian's spaceship, Grogu observes as the Mandalorian and Cara Dune engage in a friendly arm wrestling match During the contest, Grogu uses the Force to choke Cara, nearly strangling her to death before the Mandalorian intervenes [72] [73] [74] Throughout the Star Wars franchise, that ability has been most commonly associated with the dark side of the Force, and particularly with the antagonist character Darth Vader [128] [129] Sarah Bea Milner of Screen Rant wrote: \"The moment is genuinely shocking — and more than a little disturbing.\" [128] Some reviewers noted, however, that Grogu likely mistakenly believed the Mandalorian was in danger and intervened to help [129] [130] Additionally, in the same episode, Grogu uses the Force to heal and save Greef Karga, a power typically associated with the Light Side [128] [72] [130] Peter Foy of Comic Book Resources wrote: \"It doesn't exactly seem realistic that Disney would blow its merchandising potential with the little cutie by going all Damien (The Omen) in his storyline.\" [72]\n\n\nCultural impact\nGrogu has received a positive reception from fans and reviewers, [4] [67] and is widely considered the show's breakout character [2] [3] [132] [133] Fans immediately adopted the nickname \"Baby Yoda\" to describe the character, [11] [134] [135] a moniker Favreau has embraced as \"the easiest, shortest, most hashtagable way to identify that character\" [11] However, the nickname is not used internally by the crew of The Mandalorian, and Disney CEO Bob Iger said he \"got  [his] wrist slapped\" by Favreau for calling the character Baby Yoda in e-mail messages [136] [137] Iger later said the scale of the positive reaction to Grogu was \"beyond my expectations by a wide margin\" [138] [139]\n\n\nCritical reception\nGrogu has received a positive

Mandalorian, Grogu was driving almost twice as many social media interactions on news stories about it as any of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates [10] [153] [154] The Baby Yoda search term saw continuous growth on Google Trends in the weeks following the release of The Mandalorian [64] There were 2.28 million social media interactions about the characters on news stories in the first two weeks after the release of The Mandalorian, [154] and two million tweets featuring the words \"Baby Yoda\" were sent on Twitter between November 12 and December 5, 2019 [64] When Favreau tweeted a concept art image of the character by artist Christian Alzmann on November 19, it received more than 34,000 retweets and 217,000 likes within one week [67] Various celebrities have tweeted about the character, including Ariana Grande, [64] Elon Musk, [155] Dwayne Johnson, Russell Wilson, Alex Rodriguez, [151] and Donald Trump Jr [156] Zach Vasquez of The Guardian wrote: \"It's now practically impossible to scroll through any social media platform without being inundated with pics, videos, memes and gifs of the bug-eyed, big-eared tot.\" [4] The Los Angeles Times included Grogu in its list of \"2019's Internet Obsessions\", with writer Christie D'Zurilla writing: \"Baby Yoda won the Internet in 2019.\" [155]\n\n\nCultural references\nIn December 2019, artwork of Disney CEO Bob Iger with Grogu appeared in the Time magazine article naming Iger their Businessperson of the Year [166] The New Yorker published a cartoon of a woman pushing a baby stroller and saying to the baby inside it: \"No offense, but Baby Yoda, like, blows you out of the water.\" [67] Ice2Ice, a musician associated with the website The Ringer, released \"Dear Baby Yoda: A Love Song\" on December 3, 2019, with the music based upon the song \"Dear Theodosia\" from the musical Hamilton [167] [168] [169] The character was also mentioned in the December 2019 South Park episode \"Basic Cable\" In the episode, a character named Scott Malkinson attempts to get Disney+ because the woman he is interested in loves Grogu, so he believes she will love him too if he gets the streaming service [170] Grogu was also parodied multiple times on Saturday Night Live's Weekend Update segment by comedian Kyle Mooney, starting on the December 14, 2019 episode, in which he gossiped about the Mandalorian cast, talked about his future business ventures, and threatened Baby Groot [171] [172] At the 77th Golden Globe Awards, host Ricky Gervais jokingly mistook Joe Pesci for \"Baby Yoda\" [173] On February 20, the United States Army revealed that a M1 Abrams tank belonging to the 3rd Infantry Division of Fort Stewart in Georgia had been named after Grogu, with the words \"BABY YODA\" printed on the barrel of its gun [174] [175] Some critics have noted that other media companies introduced young versions of their own characters following the debut of Grogu, and suggested they could be attempts to capitalize on Grogu's success As an example, Ashley Carman of The Verge cited \"Baby Sonic\", a young version of the video game character Sonic the Hedgehog who appears in his 2020 film, which she described as \"like something ripped out of Disney's playbook\" [176]\n\n\nMerchandise\nI think that part of what people really value is to be surprised and delighted, and I think that's becoming all too rare It's very difficult to keep secrets about projects you're working on By holding back on that one product, we knew that we may have had the disadvantage of not having toys available day and date, but what we got in exchange was an excitement surrounding the character, because everybody felt like they discovered him together.\n\n\nIn video games\nIn March 2020, an unofficial user-created mod for the video game Star Wars Battlefront II allowed the character BB-8 to be replaced with a playable version of Grogu [196] [197] [198] Grogu appears in Fortnite Battle Royale as a pet that floats in the hover-pram behind the player in-game [199] A non-playable Grogu is included as part of The Mandalorian: Season 1 character DLC for the 2022 video game Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, accompanying Din Djarin in a floating pod that closes to protect Grogu when attacked [200]\n\n\nIn science\nIn 2021, Grogu's likeness was published in scientific literature, in a medical journal article titled, \"Baby Yoda: Pareidolia and Patternicity in Sacral MRI and CT Scans\" [201] The lead author was Patrick Foye, M.D., a professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Rutgers University In this article, he introduced a novel way of visualizing the sacrum when viewing MRI and CT scans He noted that in certain image slices the human sacral anatomy resembles the face of \"Baby Yoda\" Sacral openings for exiting nerves (sacral foramina) resemble Baby Yoda's eyes, while the sacral canal resembles Baby Yoda's mouth These and other comparisons can help physicians to use the \"Baby Yoda sign\" to evaluate both normal and abnormal anatomic findings on the imaging studies [202]\n\n\nRelationships\n\n\nMentorship tree\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nWorks

of Hindus, a holiday in many states of India with regional holidays in other countries It is a cultural celebration that gives Hindus and non-Hindus alike an opportunity to have fun banter with other people by throwing coloured water and powder at each other It is also observed broadly on the Indian subcontinent Holi is celebrated at the end of winter, on the last full moon day of the Hindu luni-solar calendar month, marking the spring, making the date vary with the lunar cycle [note 1] The date falls typically in March, but sometimes late February of the Gregorian calendar [30] [31]\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nLegends\nIn the Braj region of India, where the Hindu deities Radha and Krishna grew up, the festival is celebrated until Rang Panchmi in commemoration of their divine love for each other The festivities officially usher in spring, with Holi celebrated as a festival of love [9] [40] Garga Samhita, a puranic work by Sage Garga was the first work of literature to mention the romantic description of Radha and Krishna playing Holi [41] There is also a popular symbolic legend behind the festival In his youth, Krishna despaired whether the fair-skinned Radha would like him because of his dark skin colour His mother Yashoda, tired of his desperation, asks him to approach Radha and ask her to colour his face in any colour she wanted This Radha did, and Radha and Krishna became a couple Ever since, the playful colouring of Radha and Krishna's faces has been commemorated as Holi [10] [42] Beyond India, these legends help to explain the significance of Holi (Phagwah), which is common in some Caribbean communities of Indian origin such as Guyana, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Jamaica [43] [44] It is also celebrated with great fervour in Mauritius, Fiji, and South Africa [45]\n\n\nRadha Krishna\nIn the Braj region of India, where the Hindu deities Radha and Krishna grew up, the festival is celebrated until Rang Panchmi in commemoration of their

would like him because of his dark skin colour His mother Yashoda, tired of his desperation, asks him to approach Radha and ask her to colour his face in any colour she wanted This Radha did, and Radha and Krishna became a couple Ever since, the playful colouring of Radha and Krishna's faces has been commemorated as Holi [10] [42] Beyond India, these legends help to explain the significance of Holi (Phagwah), which is common in some Caribbean communities of Indian origin such as Guyana, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Jamaica [43] [44] It is also celebrated with great fervour in Mauritius, Fiji, and South Africa [45]\n\n\nVishnu\nThere is a symbolic legend found in the 7th chapter of the Bhagavata Purana [13] [14]  explaining why Holi is celebrated as a festival of triumph of good over evil in the honour of Hindu god Vishnu and his devotee Prahlada King Hiranyakashipu, the father of Prahlada, was the king of demonic Asuras and had earned a boon that gave him five special powers: he could be killed by neither a human being nor an animal, neither indoors nor outdoors, neither at day nor at night, neither by astra (projectile weapons) nor by any shastra (handheld weapons), and neither on land nor in water or air Hiranyakashipu grew arrogant, thought he was God, and demanded that everyone worship only him [5]\nHiranyakashipu's own son, Prahlada, however, remained devoted to Vishnu [46] This infuriated Hiranyakashipu He subjected Prahlada to cruel punishments, none of which affected the boy or his resolve to do what he thought was right Finally, Holika, Prahlada's evil aunt, tricked him into sitting on a pyre with her [5] Holika was wearing a cloak that made her immune to injury from fire, while Prahlada was not As the fire spread, the cloak flew from Holika and encased Prahlada, [46] who survived while Holika burned Vishnu, the god who appears as an avatar to restore Dharma in Hindu beliefs, took the form of Narasimha – half human and half lion (which is neither a human nor an animal), at dusk (when it was neither day nor night), took Hiranyakashyapu at a doorstep (which was neither indoors nor outdoors), placed him on his lap (which was neither land, water nor air), and then eviscerated and killed the king with his lion claws (which were neither a handheld weapon nor a launched weapon) [47]\n\n\nKama and Rati\nAmong other Hindu traditions such as Shaivism and Shaktism, the legendary significance of Holi is linked to Shiva in yoga and deep meditation Goddess Parvati wanting to bring Shiva back into the world, seeks help from the Hindu god of love called Kamadeva on Vasant Panchami The love god shoots arrows at Shiva, the yogi opens his third eye and burns Kama to ashes This upsets both Kama's wife Rati (Kamadevi) and his own wife Parvati Rati performs her own meditative asceticism for forty days, upon which Shiva understands, forgives out of compassion and restores the god of love This return of the god of love, is celebrated on the 40th day after the Vasant Panchami festival as Holi [48] [49] The Kama legend and its significance to Holi has many variant forms, particularly in South India [50]\n\n\nCultural

sacred ancient tradition of Hindus, a holiday in many states of India with regional holidays in other countries. It is a cultural celebration that gives Hindus and non-Hindus alike an opportunity to have fun banter with other people by throwing coloured water and powder at each other. It is also observed broadly on the Indian subcontinent. Holi is celebrated at the end of winter, on the last full moon day of the Hindu luni-solar calendar month, marking the spring, making the date vary with the lunar cycle. The date falls typically in March, but sometimes late February of the Gregorian calendar.\n\n**Legends**\n\nIn the Braj region of India, where the Hindu deities Radha and Krishna grew up, the festival is celebrated until Rang Panchmi in commemoration of their divine love for each other. The festivities officially usher in spring, with Holi celebrated as a festival of love. Garga Samhita, a puranic work by Sage Garga, was the first work of literature to mention the romantic description of Radha and Krishna playing Holi. There is also a popular symbolic legend behind the festival. In his youth, Krishna despaired whether the fair-skinned Radha would like him because of his dark skin colour. His mother Yashoda, tired of his desperation, asks him to approach Radha and ask her to colour his face in any colour she wanted. This Radha did, and Radha and Krishna became a couple. Ever since, the playful colouring of Radha and Krishna's faces has been commemorated as Holi.\n\n**Radha Krishna**\n\nIn the Braj region of India, where the Hindu deities Radha and Krishna grew up, the festival is celebrated until Rang Panchmi in commemoration of their divine love for each other.

Ever since, the playful colouring of Radha and Krishna's faces has been commemorated as Holi.\n\n**Vishnu**\n\nThere is a symbolic legend found in the 7th chapter of the Bhagavata Purana explaining why Holi is celebrated as a festival of triumph of good over evil in the honour of Hindu god Vishnu. The legend tells the story of King Hiranyakashipu, the father of Prahlada, who was the king of demonic Asuras. Hiranyakashipu grew arrogant and thought he was God, and demanded that everyone worship only him. Hiranyakashipu's own son, Prahlada, however, remained devoted to Vishnu. This infuriated Hiranyakashipu, who subjected Prahlada to cruel punishments, none of which affected the boy or his resolve to do what he thought was right. Finally, Holika, Prahlada's evil aunt, tricked him into sitting on a pyre with her. Holika was wearing a cloak that made her immune to injury from fire, while Prahlada was not. As the fire spread, the cloak flew from Holika and encased Prahlada, who survived while Holika burned. Vishnu, the god who appears as an avatar to restore Dharma in Hindu beliefs, took the form of Narasimha - half human and half lion (which is neither a human nor an animal), at dusk (when it was neither day nor night), took Hiranyakashyapu at a doorstep (which was neither indoors nor outdoors), placed him on his lap (which was neither land, water nor air), and then eviscerated and killed the king with his lion claws (which were neither a handheld weapon nor a launched weapon).\n\n**Kama and Rati**\n\nAmong other Hindu traditions such as Shaivism and Shaktism, the legendary significance of Holi is linked to Shiva in yoga and deep meditation. Goddess Parvati wanting to bring Shiva back into the world, seeks help from the Hindu god of love called Kamadeva. On Vasant Panchami, the love god shoots arrows at Shiva, the yogi opens his third eye and burns Kama to ashes. This upsets both Kama's wife Rati (Kamadevi) and his own wife Parvati. Rati performs her own meditative asceticism for forty days, upon which Shiva understands, forgives out of compassion and restores the god of love. This return of the god of love, is celebrated on the 40th day after the Vasant Panchami festival as Holi.\n\n**Cultural Significance**\n\nHoli is an important festival in many Indian and non-Indian cultures.

the festival is celebrated until Rang Panchmi in commemoration of their divine love for each other The festivities officially usher in spring, with Holi celebrated as a festival of love [9] [40] Garga Samhita, a puranic work by Sage Garga was the first work of literature to mention the romantic description of Radha and Krishna playing Holi [41] There is also a popular symbolic legend behind the festival In his youth, Krishna despaired whether the fair-skinned Radha would like him because of his dark skin colour His mother Yashoda, tired of his desperation, asks him to approach Radha and ask her to colour his face in any colour she wanted This Radha did, and Radha and Krishna became a couple Ever since, the playful colouring of Radha and Krishna's faces has been commemorated as Holi [10] [42] Beyond India, these legends help to explain the significance of Holi (Phagwah), which is common in some Caribbean communities of Indian origin such as Guyana, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Jamaica [43] [44] It is also celebrated with great fervour in Mauritius, Fiji, and South Africa [45]\n\n\nRadha Krishna\nIn the Braj region of India, where the Hindu deities Radha and Krishna grew up, the festival is celebrated until Rang Panchmi in commemoration of their divine love for each other The festivities officially usher in spring, with Holi celebrated as a festival of love [9] [40] Garga Samhita, a puranic work by Sage Garga was the first work of literature to mention the romantic description of Radha and Krishna playing Holi [41] There is also a popular symbolic legend behind the

explaining why Holi is celebrated as a festival of triumph of good over evil in the honour of Hindu god Vishnu and his devotee Prahlada King Hiranyakashipu, the father of Prahlada, was the king of demonic Asuras and had earned a boon that gave him five special powers: he could be killed by neither a human being nor an animal, neither indoors nor outdoors, neither at day nor at night, neither by astra (projectile weapons) nor by any shastra (handheld weapons), and neither on land nor in water or air Hiranyakashipu grew arrogant, thought he was God, and demanded that everyone worship only him [5]\nHiranyakashipu's own son, Prahlada, however, remained devoted to Vishnu [46] This infuriated Hiranyakashipu He subjected Prahlada to cruel punishments, none of which affected the boy or his resolve to do what he thought was right Finally, Holika, Prahlada's evil aunt, tricked him into sitting on a pyre with her [5] Holika was wearing a cloak that made her immune to injury from fire, while Prahlada was not As the fire spread, the cloak flew from Holika and encased Prahlada, [46] who survived while Holika burned Vishnu, the god who appears as an avatar to restore Dharma in Hindu beliefs, took the form of Narasimha – half human and half lion (which is neither a human nor an animal), at dusk (when it was neither day nor night), took Hiranyakashyapu at a doorstep (which was neither indoors nor outdoors), placed him on his lap (which was neither land, water nor air), and then eviscerated and killed the king with his lion claws (which were neither a handheld weapon nor a launched weapon) [47]\n\n\nKama and Rati\nAmong other Hindu traditions such as Shaivism and Shaktism, the legendary significance of Holi is linked to Shiva in yoga and deep meditation Goddess Parvati wanting to bring Shiva back into the world, seeks help from the Hindu god of love called Kamadeva on Vasant Panchami The love god shoots arrows at Shiva, the yogi opens his third eye and burns Kama to ashes This upsets both Kama's wife Rati (Kamadevi) and his own wife Parvati Rati performs her own meditative asceticism for forty days, upon which Shiva understands, forgives out of compassion and restores the god of love This return of the god of love, is celebrated on the 40th day after the Vasant Panchami festival as Holi [48] [49] The Kama legend and its significance to Holi has many variant forms, particularly in South India [50]\n\n\nCultural significance\n\n\n\n\nOther Indian religions\nThe festival has traditionally been also observed by non-Hindus, such as by Jains [2] and

\"might have been more sophisticated than China claims\" [66]\n\n\nDetection\nHigh-altitude balloons are extremely difficult to detect A 2005 study by the U.S Air Force's Air University states surveillance balloons often present very small radar cross-sections, \"on the order of hundredths of a square meter, about the same as a small bird\", and essentially no infrared signature, which complicates the use of anti-aircraft weapons [62] [72] A 2009 research paper by a USAF officer stated that balloons \"are inherently stealthy\" due to a tiny infrared signature at high altitude (as the balloon possesses no engines) and because of the difficulty of radar detection (as the balloons lack sharp edges and metal structures) [73]\n\n\nFlight path\nAccording to U.S intelligence and retrospective analysis of satellite images, the balloon was tracked near Hainan island of China as early as January 15 [11] [57] [d] It was able to change its altitude before entering the Pacific Ocean, where officials believe it was blown off-course Retired NASA engineer Rodger Farley told the New York Times that winter winds may vary too little in direction to allow for course corrections [57]\n\n\nU.S. monitoring and counterintelligence\nDuring the incident, a U.S defense official stated that the balloon had \"limited additive value from an intelligence collection perspective\" Nonetheless, the Pentagon took steps to protect its assets from leaking sensitive information to the balloon [86] U.S Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said the U.S military was able to collect valuable intelligence on the balloon while it was transiting North America [22] [87] Air Force General Glen VanHerck said that the U.S Department of Defense obtained special authorization to collect intelligence against the balloon within the U.S [42]\n\n\nDowning\nOn February 4, the balloon had drifted over the Carolinas [94] The Federal Aviation Administration closed airspace over the area in one of the largest temporary flight restrictions in U.S history, \"more than five times the restricted airspace surrounding Washington, D.C., and nearly double the area of the state of Massachusetts\" [95] A ground stop was ordered on the coast at Myrtle Beach International Airport and Charleston International Airport in South Carolina, and Wilmington International Airport in North Carolina [96] [97] [98] Military aircraft were reported to be over the Carolinas [99] U.S officials later stated that this was in preparation for the eventual downing of the balloon within American territorial waters over the Atlantic Ocean [36]\n\n\nDebris recovery\nDebris from the balloon was dispersed over an area of 2.25 square kilometres (0.87 sq mi), [105] where the ocean was about 47 feet (14 m) deep [106] [63] A pair of F-15Cs from Barnes Air National Guard Base [101] used Sniper targeting pods to record the downing and locations of falling debris [107] VanHerck said the United States Navy was conducting recovery operations while the U.S Coast Guard was securing the region where the debris fell [108] Guided-missile destroyer USS Oscar Austin, guided-missile cruiser USS Philippine Sea, and dock landing ship USS Carter Hall were tasked with retrieving the balloon wreckage, alongside Coast Guard cutters and helicopters, U.S Navy divers, and FBI counterintelligence agents [109] [110] [111] General VanHerck stated that unmanned underwater vehicles controlled from rigid inflatable boats used side-scan sonar to locate the sunken debris The unmanned submersibles analyzed the wreckage to identify potential threats to recovery divers, such as explosives or batteries with hazardous materials [43]\n\n\nLegality of airspace and downing\nThe United States asserts sovereignty of the airspace above its territories Like that of other countries, this right, up to the ill-defined boundary of space, is recognized by the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation Foreign

The incident heightened tensions between the United States and China, and sparked a diplomatic row.\n\n**Background**\n\nBalloons have been used for military and intelligence gathering purposes for centuries. During World War I, balloons were used to observe the battlefield and direct artillery. After the war, balloons were increasingly replaced by airplanes, but they continued to be used for reconnaissance purposes. During the Cold War, the United States sent hundreds of high-altitude balloons, ostensibly for \"meteorological survey\" under Project Genetrix, over China and other Eastern Bloc countries to gain intelligence on their nuclear capabilities.\n\n**History and Development of Reconnaissance Balloons**\n\nBalloons have been valued for their ability to observe the battlefield and direct artillery. Their usage peaked during World War I, after which they were increasingly replaced by airplanes. During the Cold War, the United States sent hundreds of high-altitude balloons, ostensibly for \"meteorological survey\" under Project Genetrix, over China and other Eastern Bloc countries to gain intelligence on their nuclear capabilities.\n\n**Past Chinese Balloons and Unidentified Objects**\n\nSuspected Chinese surveillance balloons have been detected in U.S airspace in the past, including over Guam, Hawaii, and Florida. One incursion occurred earlier during Joe Biden's presidency, and three occurred during Donald Trump's presidency. These incursions did not persist as long as the one in 2023, and China was able to recover those balloons.\n\n**U.S.–China Tensions**\n\nThe 2023 balloon incident occurred while U.S.–China relations were at their worst in decades, following suspected incidents of Chinese espionage and amid increasing strategic competition in military and economic sectors. In 2022, the United States, along with some of its allies, imposed stringent export controls on \"foundational technologies\", such as semiconductor microprocessors, to China in order to hamper the latter's development of advanced technology and military tools.\n\n**Incident**\n\nThe balloon carried an underslung payload described as a \"technology bay\" estimated to be the size of \"two or three school buses\", and was powered by sixteen solar arrays mounted on the payload. The balloon was 200 feet (61 m) tall according to U.S General Glen D VanHerck. AI startup Synthetaic, using image data from Planet Labs spacecraft, reported the balloon's diameter as 148 feet (45 m).

and her father during two phone calls on New Year's Eve and 22 January 2020 [188] During the conversations, Harry described his decision to leave the monarchy as \"not easy\" and criticised Donald

they were stepping back from their role as senior members of the royal family, and would balance their time between the United Kingdom and North America [244] [245] A statement released by the Palace confirmed that the Duke and Duchess were to become financially independent and cease to represent the Queen [246] At the time of the announcement of Harry and Meghan's decision to \"step back\" as senior members of the royal family in 2020, 95% of the couple's income derived from the £2.3 million given to them annually by Harry's father, Charles, as part of his income from the Duchy of Cornwall

Jubilee National Service of Thanksgiving [249]\n\n\nPublicly funded police security\nHarry faced difficulties with obtaining and maintaining publicly funded security, both in Canada and the United Kingdom, after he and Meghan announced their self-demotion within the royal family While the couple resided on Vancouver Island, the Canadian Taxpayers Federation launched a petition calling for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to cease providing security to the Sussexes [253] The Government of Canada announced RCMP security would not be provided after March 2020 when the couple's status changed [254] [255] A similar petition circulated in the UK in mid-March 2020 [256] The backlash in the two countries led President Donald Trump to preemptively assert that the United States would not pay either; though, the couple never intended to ask for it while in the US [257]\n\n\nCivilian career and investments\nIn summer 2019, before announcing their decision to step back in January 2020, Harry

Duke and Duchess of Sussex\" [379] It was confirmed on 21 February 2020 that \"Sussex Royal\" would not be used as a brand name for the couple following their withdrawal from public life [380] Sussex Royal Foundation was renamed \"MWX Foundation\" on 5 August 2020 and dissolved the same day [381]\n\n\nPublic image\nIn his youth, Harry earned a reputation for being rebellious, leading the tabloid press to label him a \"wild child\" [388] At the age of 17, he was seen smoking cannabis, drinking underage with friends, and clashing physically with paparazzi outside nightclubs [388] [389] In early 2005, he was photographed at a \"Colonial and Native\"-themed birthday party in Wiltshire wearing a Nazi German Afrika Korps uniform with a swastika armband [390] His choice sparked a backlash from the media, politicians, and religious figures [391] Clarence House later issued a public statement in which Harry apologised for his behaviour [392] [393] In an interview for his 21st birthday he stated that it \"was a very stupid thing to do and I've learnt my lesson\" [394]\n\n\nPublic opinion\nIn view of their environmental activism, Harry and Meghan were criticised in August 2019 for reportedly taking four private jet journeys in 11 days, including one to Elton John's home in Nice, France [417] The criticism was in line with the reactions the royal family faced in June 2019, after it was revealed that they \"had doubled  [their] carbon footprint from business travel\" [418] [419] Harry received backlash again in August 2021 and 2022 for taking a two-hour flight on private jets between California and Aspen, Colorado, to participate in an annual charity polo tournament [420] [421] In June 2022 and on their way to California after the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, Harry and Meghan boarded a private jet that was estimated to have emitted \"ten times more carbon than flying commercial\" [422]\n\n\nPrivacy and the media\nIn January 2020, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) sided with the Mail on Sunday over a dispute between the Duke and the newspaper regarding an Instagram photo involving Harry in which, according to the newspaper, elephants were in

incidents\nIn January 2020, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) sided with the Mail on Sunday over a dispute between the Duke and the newspaper regarding an Instagram photo involving

rejected Harry's claim that the paper's description was \"inaccurate\" or \"misleading\" [441]\n\n\nNews Group and Mirror Group newspapers\nIn October 2019, it was announced that Harry had sued the Daily Mirror, The Sun and the now-defunct News of the World \"in relation to alleged phone-hacking\" [458] Former News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman had previously stated that he had hacked Harry's phone on nine occasions [459] He sought damages in excess of £200,000 from the publisher of the News of the World and The Sun and alleged an earlier agreement between News Group Newspapers and the royal family which would see he and William not take legal action in return for an apology had not been honoured [460] A palace source denied the existence of any secret agreements [461] Both brothers brought a claim privately through their mutual attorneys, but Harry decided to pursue his case separately with a new solicitor in 2019 [460] [462] In April 2023, a High Court judge said there were inconsistencies in Harry's claim, including the time when he became aware of the issue's full scale and his failure to mention an alleged agreement between the publisher and the palace [461] In July 2023, the judge ruled that part of Harry's case involving allegations of illegal information gathering would go to trial but his phone-hacking claims were dismissed for being made too late [463] In May 2024, Mr Justice Fancourt refused Harry the permission to include claims against Rupert Murdoch, expand his case's scope back to 1994 and 1995 to cover allegations involving his mother or to add new allegations from 2016 involving his then-girlfriend Meghan [464] In the following month, Mr Justice Fancourt ordered Harry to provide a written statement explaining why messages sent to his memoir ghostwriter that could potentially be related to his hacking claims had been deleted [465] Additionally, he decided that a search of Harry's laptop, text messages, and WhatsApp conversations was necessary in order to examine conversations that took place between 2005 and the beginning of 2023 [465] In October 2024, the judge announced that the two sides should either settle or go to trial in January 2025 and refused to let Harry's team include allegations that bugs were placed in rooms and cars, and trackers placed on vehicles as \"no particulars whatsoever of such allegations\" were provided [466]\n\n\nOther cases\nIn October 2013, Jo Brand appeared on Have I Got News for You and while talking about Prince George's christening she said: \"George's godparents include Hugh van Cutsem .. I presume that's a nickname as in Hugh van cuts 'em and Harry then snorts 'em.\" [481] Representatives of Kensington Palace contacted the BBC after the programme aired, pointing out the error and the implications of the joke [482] The BBC wrote to Kensington Palace apologising for the \"factual inaccuracy\" as George's godfather was William van Cutsem, but it did not apologise for the comment itself as it was part of the show's \"irreverent humor\" [482]\n\n\nInterviews\nHarry and his wife were interviewed by Oprah Winfrey in a television special for CBS, broadcast on 7 March 2021 [503] Meghan spoke about marriage, motherhood, and the pressures of public life Harry joined her later, and the pair talked about the initial difficulties associated with their move to the United States in 2020 and their plans for the future [504] During the interview, Harry criticised his father's parenting style, mentioned his father did not answer his calls and had cut him off financially, and he had no relationship with his brother [505] [506] [507] There was a wide and polarised reaction to the interview [508]\n\n\nTwitter trolling\nIn October 2021, Twitter analytics service Bot Sentinel released their analysis of more than 114,000 tweets about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, which states that 83 accounts with a combined number of 187,631 followers responsible for approximately 70% of the negative content posted about the couple [515] The report prompted an investigation by Twitter [515] Twitter stated that it found no evidence of \"widespread coordination\" between the accounts, and said that it had taken action against users who violated Twitter's conduct policy [515] Bot Sentinel also released three more reports in the following months, arguing that the accounts were part of a \"bot network\" and a similar network could be found on YouTube [516] [517] In January 2022, the BBC named Harry and Meghan among people whose photos and videos were used in fake instant profits advertisements and bitcoin-related investment schemes [518]\n\n\nTitles, styles, honours and arms\nHarry was originally styled \"His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales\" He used Wales as his surname

Harry, Duke of Sussex\n\nPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, KCVO ADC is a member of the British royal family. He is the younger son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and the late Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nEarly Life\nPrince Harry was born in the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London, on 15 September 1984 at 16:20 BST as the second child of Charles, Prince of Wales (later King Charles III), and his first wife, Diana, Princess of Wales, during the reign of his paternal grandmother Elizabeth II. He was christened Henry Charles Albert David on 21 December 1984 at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, by Robert Runcie, the then Archbishop of Canterbury. Growing up, he was referred to as \"Harry\" by family, friends, and the public, and was nicknamed \"Harold\" by his brother.\n\nHarry and his elder brother, William, were raised at Kensington Palace in London, and Highgrove House in Gloucestershire. Diana wanted her sons to have a broader range of experiences and a better understanding of ordinary life than previous royal children. She took them to venues that ranged from Walt Disney World and McDonald's to AIDS clinics and homeless shelters. Harry began accompanying his parents on official visits at an early age; his first overseas tour was with his parents to Italy in 1985. He also travelled with his family to Canada in 1991 and 1998.\n\nEducation\nLike his father and brother, Harry was educated at private schools. He started at London's Jane Mynors' nursery school and the pre-preparatory Wetherby School. Following this, he attended Ludgrove School in Berkshire. After passing entrance exams, he was admitted to Eton College. The decision to place Harry at Eton went against the past practice of the Mountbatten-Windsors to send children to Gordonstoun, which his grandfather, father, two uncles, and two cousins had attended. However, it did see Harry follow in his elder brother's footsteps and the Spencer family's, as both his mother's father and her brother attended Eton.\n\nMilitary Career\nHarry passed the Regular Commissions Board (RCB) in September 2004 and entered the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst on 8 May 2005, where he was known as Officer Cadet Wales, and joined Alamein Company. His entry into the academy had to be delayed for 4 months as he recovered from an injury to his left knee. In April 2006, Harry completed his officer training and was commissioned as a Cornet (second lieutenant) in the Blues and Royals, a regiment of the Household Cavalry in the British Army. On 13 April 2008, when he reached two years' seniority, Harry was promoted to lieutenant.\n\nArmy Air Corps and second deployment to Afghanistan\nIn October 2008, it was announced that Harry would follow his brother, father, and uncle in learning to fly military helicopters. Harry attended the Defence Helicopter Flying School at RAF Shawbury, where he joined his brother. He initially failed his pilot's theory test in February 2009. Prince Charles presented him with his flying brevet (wings) on 7 May 2010 at a ceremony at the Army Air Corps Base (AAC), Middle Wallop. Harry was awarded his Apache Flying Badge on 14 April 2011. On 16 April 2011, it was announced that Harry had been promoted to captain. In June 2011, Clarence House announced that Harry would be available for deployment in current operations in Afghanistan as an Apache helicopter pilot. The final decision rested with the Ministry of Defence's senior commanders, including principally the Chief of the Defence Staff in consultation with the wishes of Harry, the Prince of Wales, and the Queen. In October, he was transferred to a US military base in California to complete his helicopter gunship training. This final phase included live-fire training and \"environmental and judgment training\" at naval and air force facilities in California and Arizona. In the same month, it was reported that Harry was top of his class in extensive training undertaken at the Naval Air Facility, El Centro, California. While training in Southern California, he spent time in San Diego. In November 2011, Harry returned to England. He went to Wattisham Airfield in Suffolk, in the east of England, to complete his training to fly Apache helicopters.\n\nHQ London District and Invictus Games\nOn 17 January 2014, the Ministry of Defence announced that Harry had completed his attachment to 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, and would take up a staff officer role, SO3 (Defence Engagement) in HQ London District. His responsibilities would include helping to coordinate significant projects and commemorative events involving the Army in London. He was based at Horse Guards in central London.\n\nSecondment to Australian Defence Force\nOn 17 March 2015, Kensington Palace announced that Harry would leave the Armed Forces in June. Before then, he would spend four weeks throughout April and May at army barracks in Darwin, Perth, and Sydney whilst seconded to the Australian Defence Force (ADF). After leaving the Army, while considering his future, he would return to work in a voluntary capacity with the Ministry of Defence, supporting Case Officers in the Ministry's Recovery Capability Programme. He would be working with both those who administer and receive physical and mental care within the London District area.\n\nPost-military service\nIn 2021, Harry described his 10 years (2005–2015) in the army as \"the happiest times in my life.\" Since leaving the army, he has been closely involved with the armed forces through the Invictus Games, honorary military appointments, and other official engagements. On 19 December 2017, he succeeded his grandfather Prince Philip as the Captain General Royal Marines. In May 2018, he was promoted to the substantive ranks of Lieutenant Commander of the Royal Navy, Major of the British Army, and Squadron Leader of the Royal Air Force.\n\nPersonal life\nIn his youth, Harry was seen smoking cannabis and drinking underage with friends. He was also photographed at a \"Colonial and Native\"-themed birthday party in Wiltshire wearing a Nazi German Afrika Korps uniform with a swastika armband, sparking a backlash from the media, politicians, and religious figures. In 2007, Harry began dating Chelsy Davy, the daughter of Zimbabwean South African businessman Charles Davy. However, they broke up in 2010. In October 2016, he met American actress Meghan Markle, whom he began dating. They got engaged on 27 November 2017 and married on 19 May 2018 at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. The couple has two children, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor and Lilibet Mountbatten-Windsor.\n\nMarriage and family\nIn mid-2016, Harry began a relationship with American actress Meghan Markle. According to the couple, they first connected with each other via Instagram, though they have also said that they were set up on a blind date by a mutual friend in July 2016. On 8 November, eight days after the relationship was made public by the press, the prince directed his communications secretary to release a statement on his behalf to express personal concern about pejorative and false comments made about his girlfriend by mainstream media and internet trolls. In September 2017, Prince Harry and Markle first appeared together in public at the Invictus Games in Toronto. Their engagement was announced on 27 November 2017 by Harry's father. The announcement prompted generally positive comments about having a mixed-race person as a member of the royal family, especially in regard to Commonwealth countries with populations of blended or native ancestry. The marriage ceremony was held at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle on 19 May 2018. The couple later revealed in the 2021 television interview Oprah with Meghan and Harry that, three days prior to the ceremony, they had privately exchanged vows in their garden, in the presence of the Archbishop of Canterbury. However, this earlier exchange of vows was not an official religious or legally recognised marriage.\n\nHealth\nIn May 1988, Harry underwent a surgery for a minor hernia. In November 2000, he broke his thumb while playing football at Eton and underwent a minor operation. In his memoir, Spare, Harry admits that he took cocaine at the age of 17. In 2002, it was reported that, with Charles's encouragement, Harry had paid a visit to a drug rehabilitation unit to talk to drug addicts after it had emerged that he had been smoking cannabis and drinking at his father's Highgrove House and at a local pub in the summer of 2001. He adds in his memoir that he smoked cannabis at Eton and in Kensington Palace gardens, but he later told a court that \"he never smoked in his father's house.\" In the memoir, he also detailed taking magic mushrooms at a party at Courteney Cox's house in January 2016.\n\nPublic opinion\nIn view of their environmental activism, Harry and Meghan were criticised in August 2019 for reportedly taking four private jet journeys in 11 days, including one to Elton John's home in Nice, France. The criticism was in line with the reactions the royal family faced in June 2019, after it was revealed that they \"had doubled their carbon footprint from business travel.\" Harry received backlash again in August 2021 and 2022 for taking a two-hour flight on private jets between California and Aspen, Colorado, to participate in an annual charity polo tournament. In June 2022 and on their way to California after the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, Harry and Meghan boarded a private jet that was estimated to have emitted \"ten times more carbon than flying commercial.\"\n\nPrivacy and the media\nIn January 2020, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) sided with the Mail on Sunday over a dispute between the Duke and the newspaper regarding an Instagram photo involving Harry in which, according to the newspaper, elephants were in fact \"tranquilised\" and \"tethered\" during a relocating process. The IPSO rejected Harry's claim that the paper's description was \"inaccurate\" or \"misleading.\"\n\nTwitter trolling\nIn October 2021, Twitter analytics service Bot Sentinel released their analysis of more than 114,000 tweets about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, which states that 83 accounts with a combined number of 187,631 followers responsible for approximately 70% of the negative content posted about the couple.

and her father during two phone calls on New Year's Eve and 22 January 2020 [188] During the conversations, Harry described his decision to leave the monarchy as \"not easy\" and criticised Donald

Royal Canadian Mounted Police to cease providing security to the Sussexes [253] The Government of Canada announced RCMP security would not be provided after March 2020 when the couple's status changed [254] [255] A similar petition circulated in the UK in mid-March 2020 [256] The backlash in the two countries led President Donald Trump to preemptively assert that the United States would not pay either; though, the couple never intended to ask for it while in the US [257]\n\n\nCivilian career and investments\nIn summer 2019, before announcing their decision to step back in January 2020, Harry

Harry's phone on nine occasions [459] He sought damages in excess of £200,000 from the publisher of the News of the World and The Sun and alleged an earlier agreement between News Group Newspapers and the royal family which would see he and William not take legal action in return for an apology had not been honoured [460] A palace source denied the existence of any secret agreements [461] Both brothers brought a claim privately through their mutual attorneys, but Harry decided to pursue his case separately with a new solicitor in 2019 [460] [462] In April 2023, a High Court judge said there were inconsistencies in Harry's claim, including the time when he became aware of the issue's full scale and his failure to mention an alleged agreement between the publisher and the palace [461] In July 2023, the judge ruled that part of Harry's case involving allegations of illegal information gathering would go to trial but his phone-hacking claims were dismissed for being made too late [463]

add new allegations from 2016 involving his then-girlfriend Meghan [464] In the following month, Mr Justice Fancourt ordered Harry to provide a written statement explaining why messages sent to his memoir ghostwriter that could potentially be related to his hacking claims had been deleted [465] Additionally, he decided that a search of Harry's laptop, text messages, and WhatsApp conversations was necessary in order to examine conversations that took place between 2005 and the beginning of 2023 [465] In October 2024, the judge announced that the two sides should either settle or go to trial in January 2025 and refused to let Harry's team include allegations that bugs were placed in rooms and cars, and trackers placed on vehicles as \"no particulars whatsoever of such allegations\" were provided [466]\n\n\nOther cases\nIn October 2013, Jo Brand appeared on Have I Got News for You and while talking about Prince George's christening she said: \"George's godparents include Hugh van Cutsem .. I presume that's a nickname as in Hugh van cuts 'em and Harry then snorts 'em.\" [481] Representatives of Kensington Palace contacted the BBC after the programme aired, pointing out the error and the implications of the joke [482] The BBC wrote to Kensington Palace apologising for the \"factual inaccuracy\" as George's godfather was William van Cutsem, but it did not apologise for the comment itself as it was part of the show's \"irreverent humor\" [482]\n\n\nInterviews\nHarry and his wife were interviewed by Oprah Winfrey in a television special for CBS, broadcast on 7 March 2021 [503] Meghan spoke about marriage, motherhood, and the pressures of public life Harry joined her later, and the pair talked about the initial difficulties associated with their move to the United States in 2020 and their plans for the future [504] During the interview, Harry criticised his father's parenting style, mentioned his father did not answer his calls and had cut him off financially, and he had no relationship with his brother [505] [506] [507] There was a wide and polarised reaction to the interview [508]\n\n\nTwitter trolling\nIn October 2021, Twitter analytics service Bot Sentinel released their analysis of more than 114,000 tweets about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, which states that 83 accounts with a combined number of 187,631 followers responsible for approximately 70% of the negative content posted about the couple [515] The report prompted an investigation by Twitter [515] Twitter stated that it found no evidence of \"widespread coordination\" between the accounts, and said that it had taken action against users who violated Twitter's conduct policy [515] Bot Sentinel also released three more reports in the following months, arguing that the accounts were part of a \"bot network\" and a similar network could be found on YouTube [516] [517] In January 2022, the BBC named Harry and Meghan among people whose photos and videos were used in fake instant profits

It is the world's largest rodent species and is a member of the family Hydrochoeridae. The capybara has a distinctive appearance, with a heavy, barrel-shaped body, short head, and reddish-brown fur on its upper part, which turns yellowish-brown underneath.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe capybara's common name is derived from Tupi ka'apiûara, a complex agglutination of kaá (leaf) + píi (slender) + ú (eat) + ara (a suffix for agent nouns), meaning \"one who eats slender leaves\" or \"grass-eater.\" The genus name, Hydrochoerus, comes from Greek ὕδωρ (hydor \"water\") and χοῖρος (choiros \"pig, hog\"), while the species name, Hydrochaeris, comes from Greek ὕδωρ (hydor \"water\") and χαίρω (chairo \"feel happy, enjoy\").\n\n**Classification and Phylogeny**\n\nThe capybara and the lesser capybara both belong to the subfamily Hydrochoerinae, along with the rock cavies. The living capybaras and their extinct relatives were previously classified in their own family Hydrochoeridae. However, since 2002, molecular phylogenetic studies have recognized a close relationship between Hydrochoerus and Kerodon, the rock cavies, supporting placement of both genera in a subfamily of Caviidae.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe capybara has a heavy, barrel-shaped body and short head, with reddish-brown fur on the upper part of its body that turns yellowish-brown underneath. Its sweat glands can be found in the surface of the hairy portions of its skin, an unusual trait among rodents. The animal lacks down hair, and its guard hair differs little from over hair.\n\n**Ecology**\n\nCapybaras are semiaquatic mammals found throughout all countries of South America except Chile. They live in densely forested areas near bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, swamps, ponds, and marshes, as well as flooded savannah and along rivers in the tropical rainforest. They are superb swimmers and can hold their breath underwater for up to five minutes at a time. Capybaras have flourished in cattle ranches, roaming in home ranges averaging 10 hectares (25 acres) in high-density populations.\n\n**Diet and Predation**\n\nCapybaras are herbivores, grazing mainly on grasses and aquatic plants, as well as fruit and tree bark. They are very selective feeders and feed on the leaves of one species and disregard other species surrounding it. They eat a greater variety of plants during the dry season, as fewer plants are available, and switch to more abundant reeds during this time. Plants that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter, so they are not consumed at that time. The capybara's jaw hinge is not perpendicular, so they chew food by grinding back-and-forth rather than side-to-side. Capybaras are autocoprophagous, meaning they eat their own feces as a source of bacterial gut flora, to help digest the cellulose in the grass that forms their normal diet, and to extract the maximum protein and vitamins from their food. They also regurgitate food to masticate again, similar to cud-chewing by cattle. Like other rodents, a capybara's front teeth grow continually to compensate for the constant wear from eating grasses, and their cheek teeth also grow continuously.\n\n**Social Organization**\n\nCapybaras are known to be gregarious, but they sometimes live solitarily. They are more commonly found in groups of around 10–20 individuals, with two to four adult males, four to seven adult females, and the remainder juveniles. Capybara groups can consist of as many as 50 or 100 individuals during the dry season, when the animals gather around available water sources. Males establish social bonds, dominance, or general group consensus, and can make dog-like barks when threatened or when females are herding young.\n\n**Reproduction**\n\nWhen in estrus, the female's scent changes subtly and nearby males begin pursuit. In addition, a female alerts males she is in estrus by whistling through her nose. During mating, the female has the advantage and mating choice. Capybaras mate only in water, and if a female does not want to mate with a certain male, she either submerges or leaves the water. Dominant males are highly protective of the females, but they usually cannot prevent some of the subordinates from copulating. The larger the group, the harder it is for the male to watch all the females. Dominant males secure significantly more matings than each subordinate, but subordinate males, as a class, are responsible for more matings than each dominant male. The lifespan of the capybara's sperm is longer than that of other rodents.\n\n**Activities**\n\nThough quite agile on land, capybaras are equally at home in the water. They are excellent swimmers, and can remain completely submerged for up to five minutes, an ability they use to evade predators. Capybaras can sleep in water, keeping only their noses out. As temperatures increase during the day, they wallow in water and then graze during the late afternoon and early evening. They also spend time wallowing in mud. They rest around midnight and then continue to graze before dawn.\n\n**Communication**\n\nCapybaras communicate using barks, chirps, whistles, huffs, and purrs.\n\n**Conservation and Human Interaction**\n\nCapybaras are not considered a threatened species; their population is stable throughout most of their South American range, though in some areas hunting has reduced their numbers. Capybaras are hunted for their meat and pelts in some areas, and otherwise killed by humans who see their grazing as competition for livestock.

[19] their cheek teeth also grow continuously [27] \n\nSocial organization\nCapybaras are known to be gregarious While they sometimes live solitarily, they are more commonly found in groups of around 10–20 individuals, with two to four adult males, four to seven adult females, and the remainder juveniles [33] Capybara groups can consist of as many as 50 or 100 individuals during the dry season [29] [34] when the animals gather around available water sources Males establish social bonds, dominance, or general group consensus [34] They can make dog-like barks [29] when threatened or when females are herding young [35]\n\n\nReproduction\nWhen in estrus, the female's scent changes subtly and nearby males begin pursuit [37] In addition, a female alerts males she is in estrus by whistling through her nose [29] During mating, the female has the advantage and mating choice Capybaras mate only in water, and if a female does not want to mate with a certain male, she either submerges or leaves the water [29] [34] Dominant males are highly protective of the females, but they usually cannot prevent some of the subordinates from copulating The larger the group, the harder it is for the male to watch all the females Dominant males secure significantly more matings than each subordinate, but subordinate males, as a class, are responsible for more matings than each dominant male [37] The lifespan of the capybara's sperm is longer than that of other rodents [38]\n\n\nActivities\nThough quite agile on land, capybaras are equally at home in the water They are excellent swimmers, and can remain completely submerged for up to five minutes, [14] an ability they use to evade predators Capybaras can sleep in water, keeping only their noses out As temperatures increase during the day, they wallow in water and then graze during the late afternoon and early evening [7] They also spend time wallowing in mud [18] They rest around midnight and then continue to graze before dawn [7]\n\n\nCommunication\nCapybaras communicate using barks, chirps, whistles, huffs, and purrs [39]\n\n\nConservation and human interaction\nCapybaras are not considered a threatened species; [1] their population is stable throughout most of their South American range, though in some areas hunting has reduced their numbers [14] [19] Capybaras are hunted for their meat and pelts in some areas, [40] and otherwise killed by humans who see their grazing as competition for livestock In some areas, they are farmed, which has the effect of ensuring the wetland habitats are protected Their survival is aided by their ability to breed rapidly [19]\n\n\nPopularity and meme culture\nIzu Shaboten Zoo and other zoos in Japan have prepared hot spring baths for capybaras  [51] Video clips of the bathing capybaras have gained millions of views [51] The capybaras have influenced an anime character named Kapibara-san, and a series of merchandise such as plush toys [52] [53] A Capybara café has been opened in Tokyo.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

the film actors and technicians [61] The first schedule of the film's shooting was held at the Aluminium factory set for nearly 20 days [59] In June 2020, it was reported that ₹18 crore (US$2.43 million) was spent for a set replicating an entire village in Gandipet, where the team planned to film the sequences in this location post-COVID-19 lockdown [62] A set resembling the 20th-century

was interested in the coincidence of these two freedom fighters, both born in Andhra Pradesh and present-day Telangana, at the turn of the 20th century They left their respective homes, disappeared for three-four years, and then came back to fight against the oppressors But their modus operandi was the same They were striking police stations, taking away the guns, arming the people, inspiring the people Unfortunately, they both died at the hands of the British in the same way But they never met I thought: What if we make them meet, create a rift between them, and then make each one inspire the other?\"\n\n\nMusic\nRajamouli's older cousin and regular collaborator M M Keeravani composed the score and the soundtrack of the film [146] The audio rights of the film were purchased for ₹25

story [394] The director also hinted at a sequel to 'RRR' while interacting with fans in Japan in March 2024 [395]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Australia", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe name Australia (pronounced /əˈstreɪliə/ in Australian English [41]) is derived from the Latin Terra Australis ('southern land'), a name used for a hypothetical continent in the Southern Hemisphere since ancient times [42] Several 16th-century cartographers used the word Australia on maps, but not to identify modern Australia [43] When Europeans began visiting and mapping Australia in the 17th century, the name Terra Australis was applied to the new territories [N 5]\n\n\nHistory\nIndigenous Australians comprise two broad groups:\n\n\nIndigenous prehistory\nIndigenous Australians comprise two broad groups:\n\n\nEuropean exploration and colonisation\nThe Dutch are the first Europeans that recorded sighting and making landfall on the Australian mainland [90] The first ship and crew to chart the Australian coast and meet with Aboriginal people was the Duyfken, captained by Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon [91] He sighted the coast of Cape York Peninsula in early 1606, and made landfall on 26 February 1606 at the Pennefather River near the modern town of Weipa on Cape York [92] Later that year, Spanish explorer Luís Vaz de Torres sailed through and navigated the Torres Strait Islands [93] The Dutch charted the whole of the western and northern coastlines and named the island continent \"New Holland\" during the 17th century, and although no attempt at settlement was made, [92] a number of shipwrecks left men either stranded or, as in the case of the Batavia in 1629, marooned for mutiny and murder, thus becoming the first Europeans to permanently inhabit the continent [94] In 1770, Captain James Cook sailed along and mapped the east coast, which he named \"New South Wales\" and claimed for Great Britain [95]\n\n\nColonial expansion\nIn 1803, a settlement was established in Van Diemen's Land (present-day Tasmania), [106] and in 1813, Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and William Wentworth crossed the Blue Mountains west of Sydney, opening the interior to European settlement [107] The British claim extended to the whole Australian continent in 1827 when Major Edmund Lockyer established a settlement on King George Sound (modern-day Albany) [108] The Swan River Colony (present-day Perth) was established in 1829, evolving into the largest Australian colony by area, Western Australia [109] In accordance with population growth, separate colonies were carved from New South Wales: Tasmania in 1825, South Australia in 1836, New Zealand in 1841, Victoria in 1851, and Queensland in 1859 [110] South Australia was founded as a free colony—it never accepted transported convicts [111] Growing opposition to the convict system culminated in its abolition in the eastern colonies by the 1850s Initially a free colony, Western Australia practised penal transportation from 1850 to 1868 [112]\n\n\nFederation to the World Wars\nOn 1 January 1901, federation of the colonies was achieved after a decade of planning, constitutional conventions and referendums, resulting in the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia as a nation under the new Australian Constitution [125]\n\n\nPost-war and contemporary eras\nIn the decades following World War II, Australia enjoyed significant increases in living standards, leisure time and suburban development [149] [150] Governments encouraged a large wave of immigration from across Europe, with such immigrants referred to as \"New Australians\" [151] This required a relaxation of the white Australia policy, which was justified to Australians using the slogan \"populate or perish\" [152]\n\n\nGeography\nSurrounded by the Indian and Pacific oceans, [N 7] Australia is separated from Asia by the Arafura and Timor seas, with the Coral Sea lying off the Queensland coast, and the Tasman Sea lying between Australia and New Zealand The world's smallest continent [170] and sixth-largest country by total area, [171] Australia—owing to its size and isolation—is often dubbed the \"island continent\" [172] and is sometimes considered the world's largest island [173] Australia has 34,218 km (21,262 mi) of coastline (excluding all offshore islands), [174] and claims an extensive exclusive economic zone of 8,148,250 square kilometres (3,146,060 sq mi) This exclusive economic zone does not include the Australian Antarctic Territory [175]\n\n\nGeneral characteristics\nSurrounded by the Indian and Pacific oceans, [N 7] Australia is separated from Asia by the Arafura and Timor seas, with the Coral Sea lying off the Queensland coast, and the Tasman Sea lying between Australia and New Zealand The world's smallest continent [170] and sixth-largest country by total area, [171] Australia—owing to its size and isolation—is often dubbed the \"island continent\" [172] and is sometimes considered the world's largest island [173] Australia has 34,218 km (21,262 mi) of coastline (excluding all offshore islands), [174] and claims an extensive exclusive economic zone of 8,148,250 square kilometres (3,146,060 sq mi) This exclusive economic zone does not include the Australian Antarctic Territory [175]\n\n\nGeology\nLying on the Indo-Australian Plate, the mainland of Australia is the lowest and most primordial landmass on Earth with a relatively stable geological history [204] [205] The landmass includes virtually all known rock types and from all geological time periods spanning more than 3.8 billion years of the Earth's history The Pilbara Craton is one of only two pristine Archaean 3.6–2.7 Ga (billion years ago) crusts identified on the Earth [206]\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate of Australia is significantly influenced by ocean currents, including the Indian Ocean Dipole and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, which is correlated with periodic drought, and the seasonal tropical low-pressure system that produces cyclones in northern Australia [216] [217] These factors cause rainfall to vary markedly from year to year Much of the northern part of the country has a tropical, predominantly summer-rainfall (monsoon) [178] The south-west corner of the country has a Mediterranean climate [218] The south-east ranges from oceanic (Tasmania and coastal Victoria) to humid subtropical (upper half of New South Wales), with the highlands featuring alpine and subpolar oceanic climates The interior is arid to semi-arid [178]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nAlthough most of Australia is semi-arid or desert, the continent includes a diverse range of habitats from alpine heaths to tropical rainforests Fungi typify that diversity—an estimated 250,000 species—of which only 5% have been described—occur in Australia [225] Because of the continent's great age, extremely variable weather patterns, and long-term geographic isolation, much of Australia's biota is unique About 85% of flowering plants, 84% of mammals, more than 45% of birds, and 89% of in-shore, temperate-zone fish are endemic [226] Australia has at least 755 species of reptile, more than any other country in the world [227] Besides Antarctica, Australia is the only continent that developed without feline species Feral cats may have been introduced in the 17th century by Dutch shipwrecks, and later in the 18th century by European settlers They are now considered a major factor in the decline and extinction of many vulnerable and endangered native species [228] Seafaring immigrants from Asia are believed to have brought the dingo to Australia sometime after the end of the last ice age—perhaps 4000 years ago—and Aboriginal people helped disperse them across the continent as pets, contributing to the demise of thylacines on the mainland [229] Australia is also one of 17 megadiverse countries [230]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nAustralia is a constitutional monarchy, a parliamentary democracy and a federation [248] The country has maintained its mostly unchanged constitution alongside a stable liberal democratic political system since Federation in 1901 It is one of the world's oldest federations, in which power is divided between the federal and state governments The Australian system of government combines elements derived from the political systems of the United Kingdom (a fused executive, constitutional monarchy and strong party discipline) and the United States (federalism, a written constitution and strong bicameralism with an elected upper house), resulting in a distinct hybrid [249] [250]\n\n\nStates and territories\nAustralia has six states—New South Wales (NSW), Victoria (Vic), Queensland (Qld), Western Australia (WA), South Australia (SA) and Tasmania (Tas)—and two mainland self-governing territories—the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and the Northern Territory (NT) [271]\n\n\nForeign relations\nAustralia is a middle power, [38] whose foreign relations has three core bi-partisan pillars: commitment to the US alliance, engagement with the Indo-Pacific and support for international institutions, rules and co-operation [285] [286] [287] Through the ANZUS pact and its status as a major non-NATO ally, Australia maintains a close relationship with the US, which encompasses strong defence, security and trade ties [288] [289] In the Indo-Pacific, the country seeks to increase its trade ties through the open flow of trade and capital, whilst managing the rise of Chinese power by supporting the existing rules based order [286] Regionally, the country is a member of the Pacific Islands Forum, the Pacific Community, the ASEAN+6 mechanism and the East Asia Summit Internationally, the country is a member of the United Nations (of which it was a founding member), the Commonwealth of Nations, the OECD and the G20 This reflects the country's generally strong commitment to multilateralism [290] [291]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe two main institutions involved in the management of Australia's armed forces are the Australian Defence Force (ADF) and the Department of Defence, together known as \"Defence\" [305] The Australian Defence Force is the military wing, headed by the chief of the defence force, and contains three branches: the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force In 2021, it had 84,865 currently serving personnel (including 60,286 regulars and 24,581 reservists) [306] The Department of Defence is the civilian wing and is headed by the secretary of defence These two leaders collective manage Defence as a diarchy, with shared and joint responsibilities [307] The titular role of commander-in-chief is held by the governor-general; however, actual command is vested in the chief of the Defence Force [308] The executive branch of the Commonwealth government has overall control of the military through the minister of defence, who is subject to the decisions of Cabinet and its National Security Committee [309] Major Australian intelligence agencies include the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (foreign intelligence), the Australian Signals Directorate (signals intelligence) and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (domestic security).\n\n\nHuman rights\nAustralia has generally strong protections for civil and political rights, and the country has signed up to a wide range of international rights treaties [312] Important documents protecting human rights include the Constitution, the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the Disability Discrimination Act 1992, and the Age Discrimination Act 2004 [313] Same-sex marriage has been legal in the nation since 2017 [314] [315] Unlike other comparable Western democracies, Australia does not have a single federal charter of rights in the Constitution or under legislation; however, the ACT, Victoria, and Queensland have state-based ones.\n\n\nEconomy\nAustralia's high-income mixed-market economy is rich in natural resources [318] It is the world's fourteenth-largest by nominal terms, and the 18th-largest by PPP As of 2021 [update], it has the second-highest amount of wealth per adult, after Luxembourg, [319] and has the thirteenth-highest financial assets per capita [320] Australia has a labour force of some 13.5 million, with an unemployment rate of 3.5% as of June 2022 [321] According to the Australian Council of Social Service, the poverty rate of Australia exceeds 13.6% of the population, encompassing 3.2 million It also estimated that there were 774,000 (17.7%) children under the age of 15 living in relative poverty [322] [323] The Australian dollar is the national currency, which is also used by three island states in the Pacific: Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu [324]\n\n\nEnergy\nIn 2021–22, Australia's generation of electricity was sourced from black coal (37.2%), brown coal (12%), natural gas (18.8%), hydro (6.5%), wind (11.1%), solar (13.3%), bio-energy (1.2%) and others (1.7%) [339] [340] Total consumption of energy in this period was sourced from coal (28.4%), oil (37.3%), gas (27.4%) and renewables (7%) [341] From 2012 to 2022, the energy sourced from renewables has increased 5.7%, whilst energy sourced from coal has decreased 2.6% The use of gas also increased by 1.5% and the use of oil stayed relatively stable with a reduction of only 0.2% [342]\n\n\nScience and technology\nIn 2019, Australia spent $35.6 billion on research and development, allocating about 1.79% of GDP [347] A recent study by Accenture for the Tech Council shows that the Australian tech sector combined contributes $167 billion a year to the economy and employs 861,000 people [348] In addition, recent startup ecosystems in Sydney and Melbourne are already valued at $34 billion combined [349] Australia ranked 23rd in the Global Innovation Index 2024 [350]\n\n\nDemographics\nAustralia has a population density of 3.4 persons per square kilometre of total land area, which makes it one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world The population is heavily concentrated on the east coast, and in particular in the south-eastern region between South East Queensland to the north-east and Adelaide to the south-west [31]\n\n\nCities\nAustralia contains five cities (including their suburbs) that consist of more than one million people Most of Australia's population live close to coastlines [360]\n\n\n\nAncestry and immigration\nBetween 1788 and the Second World War, the vast majority of settlers and immigrants came from the British Isles (principally England, Ireland and Scotland), although there was significant immigration from China and Germany during the 19th century Following Federation in 1901, a strengthening of the white Australia policy restricted further migration from these areas However, this policy was relaxed following WW2 and in the decades following, Australia received a large wave of immigration from across Europe, with many more immigrants arriving from Southern and Eastern Europe than in previous decades All overt racial discrimination ended in 1973, with multiculturalism becoming official policy [362] Subsequently, there has been a large and continuing wave of immigration from across the world, with Asia being the largest source of immigrants in the 21st century [363]\n\n\nLanguage\nAlthough English is not the official language of Australia in law, it is the de facto official and national language [374] [375] Australian English is a major variety of the language with a distinctive accent and lexicon, [376] and differs slightly from other varieties of English in grammar and spelling [377] General Australian serves as the standard dialect [378] The Australian sign language known as Auslan was used at home by 16,242 people at the time of the 2021 census [379]\n\n\nReligion\nAustralia has no state religion; section 116 of the Australian Constitution prohibits the Australian government from making any law to establish any religion, impose any religious observance, or prohibit the free exercise of any religion [385] However, the states still retain the power to pass religiously discriminatory laws [386]\n\n\nHealth\nAustralia's life expectancy of 83 years (81 years for males and 85 years for females) [390] is the fifth-highest in the world It has the highest rate of skin cancer in the world, [391] while cigarette smoking is the largest preventable cause of death and disease, responsible for 7.8% of the total mortality and disease Ranked second in preventable causes is hypertension at 7.6%, with obesity third at 7.5% [392] [393] Australia ranked 35th in the world in 2012 for its proportion of obese women [394] and near the top of developed nations for its proportion of obese adults; [395] 63% of its adult population is either overweight or obese [396]\n\n\nEducation\nSchool attendance, or registration for home schooling, [401] is compulsory throughout Australia Education is primarily the responsibility of the individual states and territories; however, the Commonwealth has significant influence through funding agreements [402] Since 2014, a national curriculum developed by the Commonwealth has been implemented by the states and territories [403] Attendance rules vary between states, but in general children are required to attend school from the age of about 5 until about 16 [404] [405] In some states (Western Australia, Northern Territory and New South Wales), children aged 16–17 are required to either attend school or participate in vocational training, such as an apprenticeship [406] [407] [408] [409] According to the 2022 PISA evaluations, Australian 15-year-olds ranked ninth in the OECD for reading and science and tenth for maths However, less than 60% of Australian students achieved the National Proficiency Standard – 51% in maths, 58% in science and 57% in reading [410] [411]\n\n\nCulture\nContemporary Australian culture reflects the country's Indigenous traditions, Anglo-Celtic heritage, and post-1945 history of multicultural immigration [427] [428] [429] The culture of the United States has also been influential [430] The evolution of Australian culture since British colonisation has given rise to distinctive cultural traits [431] [432]\n\n\nArts\nAustralia has more than 100,000 Aboriginal rock art sites, [444] and traditional designs, patterns and stories infuse contemporary Indigenous Australian art, \"the last great art movement of the 20th century\" according to critic Robert Hughes; [445] its exponents include Emily Kame Kngwarreye [446] Early colonial artists showed a fascination with the unfamiliar land [447] The impressionistic works of Arthur Streeton, Tom Roberts and other members of the 19th-century Heidelberg School—the first \"distinctively Australian\" movement in Western art—gave expression to nationalist sentiments in the lead-up to Federation [447] While the school remained influential into the 1900s, modernists such as Margaret Preston and Clarice Beckett, and, later, Sidney Nolan, explored new artistic trends [447] The landscape remained central to the work of Aboriginal watercolourist Albert Namatjira, [448] as well as Fred Williams, Brett Whiteley and other post-war artists whose works, eclectic in style yet uniquely Australian, moved between the figurative and the abstract [447] [449]\n\n\nMedia\nThe Story of the Kelly Gang (1906), the world's first feature-length narrative film, spurred a boom in Australian cinema during the silent film era [465] After World War I, Hollywood monopolised the industry, [466] and by the 1960s Australian film production had effectively ceased [467] With the benefit of government support, the Australian New Wave of the 1970s brought provocative and successful films, many exploring themes of national identity, such as Picnic at Hanging Rock, Wake in Fright and Gallipoli, [468] while Crocodile Dundee and the Ozploitation movement's Mad Max series became international blockbusters [469] In a film market flooded with foreign content, Australian films delivered a 7.7% share of the local box office in 2015 [470] The AACTAs are Australia's premier film and television awards, and notable Academy Award winners from Australia include Geoffrey Rush, Nicole Kidman, Cate Blanchett and Heath Ledger [471]\n\n\nCuisine\nMost Indigenous Australian groups subsisted on a diet of native fauna and flora, otherwise called bush tucker [476] It has increased in popularity among non-Indigenous Australians since the 1970s, with examples such as lemon myrtle, the macadamia nut and kangaroo meat now widely available [477] [478]\n\n\nSport and recreation\nThe most popular sports in Australia by adult participation are: swimming, athletics, cycling, soccer, golf, tennis, basketball, surfing, netball and cricket [490]\n\n\nSee

"**Australia**\n\nAustralia is a country and continent located in the Southern Hemisphere. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area and the world's smallest continent. Australia is a federation of six states and two territories, with a population of over 25 million people.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name Australia is derived from the Latin Terra Australis, meaning \"southern land\". This name was used by ancient Greeks and Romans to describe a hypothetical continent in the Southern Hemisphere. The name was later adopted by European cartographers in the 16th century to identify the new territories they were mapping.\n\n**History**\n\nIndigenous Australians comprise two broad groups: the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The Aboriginal people have been living in Australia for at least 65,000 years, with some estimates suggesting that they may have been living in Australia for up to 80,000 years. The Torres Strait Islander people have been living in the Torres Strait Islands, which are located between the northern tip of Australia and the island of New Guinea, for at least 3,000 years.\n\nEuropean exploration and colonization of Australia began in the 17th century, with the Dutch being the first Europeans to record sighting and making landfall on the Australian mainland. The first ship and crew to chart the Australian coast and meet with Aboriginal people was the Duyfken, captained by Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon. He sighted the coast of Cape York Peninsula in early 1606, and made landfall on 26 February 1606 at the Pennefather River near the modern town of Weipa on Cape York.\n\nLater that year, Spanish explorer Luís Vaz de Torres sailed through and navigated the Torres Strait Islands. The Dutch charted the whole of the western and northern coastlines and named the island continent \"New Holland\" during the 17th century. Although no attempt at settlement was made, a number of shipwrecks left men either stranded or, as in the case of the Batavia in 1629, marooned for mutiny and murder, thus becoming the first Europeans to permanently inhabit the continent.\n\nIn 1770, Captain James Cook sailed along and mapped the east coast, which he named \"New South Wales\" and claimed for Great Britain. The British established a penal colony in New South Wales in 1788, and over the next several decades, the British established a number of other colonies in Australia.\n\n**Colonial expansion**\n\nIn 1803, a settlement was established in Van Diemen's Land (present-day Tasmania). In 1813, Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson, and William Wentworth crossed the Blue Mountains west of Sydney, opening the interior to European settlement. The British claim extended to the whole Australian continent in 1827 when Major Edmund Lockyer established a settlement on King George Sound (modern-day Albany). The Swan River Colony (present-day Perth) was established in 1829, evolving into the largest Australian colony by area, Western Australia.\n\nIn accordance with population growth, separate colonies were carved from New South Wales: Tasmania in 1825, South Australia in 1836, New Zealand in 1841, Victoria in 1851, and Queensland in 1859. South Australia was founded as a free colony – it never accepted transported convicts. Growing opposition to the convict system culminated in its abolition in the eastern colonies by the 1850s. Initially a free colony, Western Australia practised penal transportation from 1850 to 1868.\n\n**Federation to the World Wars**\n\nOn 1 January 1901, federation of the colonies was achieved after a decade of planning, constitutional conventions, and referendums, resulting in the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia as a nation under the new Australian Constitution.\n\n**Post-war and contemporary eras**\n\nIn the decades following World War II, Australia enjoyed significant increases in living standards, leisure time, and suburban development. Governments encouraged a large wave of immigration from across Europe, with such immigrants referred to as \"New Australians.\" This required a relaxation of the white Australia policy, which was justified to Australians using the slogan \"populate or perish.\"\n\n**Geography**\n\nAustralia is surrounded by the Indian and Pacific oceans and is separated from Asia by the Arafura and Timor seas, with the Coral Sea lying off the Queensland coast and the Tasman Sea lying between Australia and New Zealand. Australia is the world's smallest continent and the sixth-largest country by total area. It has a coastline of 34,218 kilometers (21,262 miles) and claims an extensive exclusive economic zone of 8,148,250 square kilometers (3,146,060 square miles).\n\n**General characteristics**\n\nAustralia is a country of diverse geography and climate. The climate is significantly influenced by ocean currents, including the Indian Ocean Dipole and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, which is correlated with periodic drought, and the seasonal tropical low-pressure system that produces cyclones in northern Australia. These factors cause rainfall to vary markedly from year to year.\n\n**Geology**\n\nThe mainland of Australia is the lowest and most primordial landmass on Earth, with a relatively stable geological history. The landmass includes virtually all known rock types and from all geological time periods, spanning more than 3.8 billion years of the Earth's history. The Pilbara Craton is one of only two pristine Archaean 3.6-2.7 Ga (billion years ago) crusts identified on the Earth.\n\n**Climate**\n\nThe climate of Australia is significantly influenced by ocean currents and varies markedly from year to year. Much of the northern part of the country has a tropical, predominantly summer-rainfall (monsoon) climate. The south-west corner of the country has a Mediterranean climate. The south-east ranges from oceanic (Tasmania and coastal Victoria) to humid subtropical (upper half of New South Wales), with the highlands featuring alpine and subpolar oceanic climates. The interior is arid to semi-arid.\n\n**Biodiversity**\n\nAlthough most of Australia is semi-arid or desert, the continent includes a diverse range of habitats from alpine heaths to tropical rainforests. Fungi typify that diversity – an estimated 250,000 species occur in Australia, of which only 5% have been described. Because of the continent's great age, extremely variable weather patterns, and long-term geographic isolation, much of Australia's biota is unique. About 85% of flowering plants, 84% of mammals, more than 45% of birds, and 89% of in-shore, temperate-zone fish are endemic. Australia has at least 755 species of reptile, more than any other country in the world. Besides Antarctica, Australia is the only continent that developed without feline species. Feral cats may have been introduced in the 17th century by Dutch shipwrecks, and later in the 18th century by European settlers. They are now considered a major factor in the decline and extinction of many vulnerable and endangered native species.\n\n**Government and politics**\n\nAustralia is a constitutional monarchy, a parliamentary democracy, and a federation. The country has maintained its mostly unchanged constitution alongside a stable liberal democratic political system since Federation in 1901. It is one of the world's oldest federations, in which power is divided between the federal and state governments. The Australian system of government combines elements derived from the political systems of the United Kingdom (a fused executive, constitutional monarchy, and strong party discipline) and the United States (federalism, a written constitution, and strong bicameralism with an elected upper house), resulting in a distinct hybrid.\n\n**States and territories**\n\nAustralia has six states – New South Wales (NSW), Victoria (Vic), Queensland (Qld), Western Australia (WA), South Australia (SA), and Tasmania (Tas) – and two mainland self-governing territories – the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and the Northern Territory (NT).\n\n**Foreign relations**\n\nAustralia is a middle power, with foreign relations having three core bipartisan pillars: commitment to the US alliance, engagement with the Indo-Pacific, and support for international institutions, rules, and cooperation. Through the ANZUS pact and its status as a major non-NATO ally, Australia maintains a close relationship with the US, which encompasses strong defense, security, and trade ties. In the Indo-Pacific, the country seeks to increase its trade ties through the open flow of trade and capital, while managing the rise of Chinese power by supporting the existing rules-based order. Regionally, the country is a member of the Pacific Islands Forum, the Pacific Community, the ASEAN+6 mechanism, and the East Asia Summit. Internationally, the country is a member of the United Nations (of which it was a founding member), the Commonwealth of Nations, the OECD, and the G20, reflecting its generally strong commitment to multilateralism.\n\n**Military**\n\nThe two main institutions involved in the management of Australia's armed forces are the Australian Defence Force (ADF) and the Department of Defence, together known as \"Defence.\" The Australian Defence Force is the military wing, headed by the Chief of the Defence Force, and contains three branches: the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Army, and the Royal Australian Air Force. In 2021, it had 84,865 currently serving personnel (including 60,286 regulars and 24,581 reservists). The Department of Defence is the civilian wing and is headed by the Secretary of Defence. These two leaders collectively manage Defence as a diarchy, with shared and joint responsibilities. The titular role of Commander-in-Chief is held by the Governor-General; however, actual command is vested in the Chief of the Defence Force. The executive branch of the Commonwealth government has overall control of the military through the Minister of Defence, who is subject to the decisions of Cabinet and its National Security Committee. Major Australian intelligence agencies include the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (foreign intelligence), the Australian Signals Directorate (signals intelligence), and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (domestic security).\n\n**Human rights**\n\nAustralia has generally strong protections for civil and political rights, and the country has signed up to a wide range of international rights treaties. Important documents protecting human rights include the Constitution, the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the Disability Discrimination Act 1992, and the Age Discrimination Act 2004. Same-sex marriage has been legal in the nation since 2017. Unlike other comparable Western democracies, Australia does not have a single federal charter of rights in the Constitution or under legislation; however, the ACT, Victoria, and Queensland have state-based ones.\n\n**Economy**\n\nAustralia's high-income mixed-market economy is rich in natural resources. It is the world's 14th-largest by nominal terms and the 18th-largest by PPP. As of 2021, it has the second-highest amount of wealth per adult, after Luxembourg, and has the 13th-highest financial assets per capita. Australia has a labor force of some 13.5 million, with an unemployment rate of 3.5% as of June 2022. According to the Australian Council of Social Service, the poverty rate of Australia exceeds 13.6% of the population, encompassing 3.2 million. It also estimated that there were 774,000 (17.7%) children under the age of 15 living in relative poverty. The Australian dollar is the national currency, which is also used by three island states in the Pacific – Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu.\n\n**Energy**\n\nIn 2021-22, Australia's generation of electricity was sourced from black coal (37.2%), brown coal (12%), natural gas (18.8%), hydro (6.5%), wind (11.1%), solar (13.3%), bio-energy (1.2%), and others (1.7%). Total consumption of energy in this period was sourced from coal (28.4%), oil (37.3%), gas (27.4%), and renewables (7%). From 2012 to 2022, the energy sourced from renewables has increased 5.7%, while energy sourced from coal has decreased 2.6%. The use of gas also increased by 1.5%, and the use of oil stayed relatively stable with a reduction of only 0.2%.\n\n**Science and technology**\n\nIn 2019, Australia spent $35.6 billion on research and development, allocating about 1.79% of GDP. A recent study by Accenture for the Tech Council shows that the Australian tech sector combined contributes $167 billion a year to the economy and employs 861,000 people. In addition, recent startup ecosystems in Sydney and Melbourne are already valued at $34 billion combined. Australia ranked 23rd in the Global Innovation Index 2024.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nAustralia has a population density of 3.4 persons per square kilometer of total land area, making it one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world. The population is heavily concentrated on the east coast, and in particular in the south-eastern region between South East Queensland to the north-east and Adelaide to the south-west.\n\n**Cities**\n\nAustralia contains five cities (including their suburbs) that consist of more than one million people. Most of Australia's population live close to coastlines.\n\n**Ancestry and immigration**\n\nBetween 1788 and the Second World War, the vast majority of settlers and immigrants came from the British Isles (principally England, Ireland, and Scotland), although there was significant immigration from China and Germany during the 19th century. Following Federation in 1901, a strengthening of the white Australia policy restricted further migration from these areas. However, this policy was relaxed following WW2, and in the decades following, Australia received a large wave of immigration from across Europe, with many more immigrants arriving from Southern and Eastern Europe than in previous decades. All overt racial discrimination ended in 1973, with multiculturalism becoming official policy. Subsequently, there has been a large and continuing wave of immigration from across the world, with Asia being the largest source of immigrants in the 21st century.\n\n**Language**\n\nAlthough English is not the official language of Australia in law, it is the de facto official and national language. Australian English is a major variety of the language with a distinctive accent and lexicon, and differs slightly from other varieties of English in grammar and spelling. General Australian serves as the standard dialect. The Australian sign language known as Auslan was used at home by 16,242 people at the time of the 2021 census.\n\n**Religion**\n\nAustralia has no state religion; section 116 of the Australian Constitution prohibits the Australian government from making any law to establish any religion, impose any religious observance, or prohibit the free exercise of any religion. However, the states still retain the power to pass religiously discriminatory laws.\n\n**Health**\n\nAustralia's life expectancy of 83 years (81 years for males and 85 years for females) is the fifth-highest in the world. It has the highest rate of skin cancer in the world, while cigarette smoking is the largest preventable cause of death and disease, responsible for 7.8% of the total mortality and disease. Ranked second in preventable causes is hypertension at 7.6%, with obesity third at 7.5%. Australia ranked 35th in the world in 2012 for its proportion of obese women and near the top of developed nations for its proportion of obese adults; 63% of its adult population is either overweight or obese.\n\n**Education**\n\nSchool attendance, or registration for home schooling, is compulsory throughout Australia. Education is primarily the responsibility of the individual states and territories; however, the Commonwealth has significant influence through funding agreements. Since 2014, a national curriculum developed by the Commonwealth has been implemented by the states and territories. Attendance rules vary between states, but in general, children are required to attend school from the age of about 5 until about 16. In some states (Western Australia, Northern Territory, and New South Wales), children aged 16-17 are required to either attend school or participate in vocational training, such as an apprenticeship. According to the 2022 PISA evaluations, Australian 15-year-olds ranked ninth in the OECD for reading and science and tenth for maths. However, less than 60% of Australian students achieved the National Proficiency Standard – 51% in maths, 58% in science, and 57% in reading.\n\n**Culture**\n\nContemporary Australian culture reflects the country's Indigenous traditions, Anglo-Celtic heritage, and post-1945 history of multicultural immigration. The culture of the United States has also been influential. The evolution of Australian culture since British colonization has given rise to distinctive cultural traits.\n\n**Arts**\n\nAustralia has more than 100,000 Aboriginal rock art sites, and traditional designs, patterns, and stories infuse contemporary Indigenous Australian art, \"the last great art movement of the 20th century\" according to critic Robert Hughes. Its exponents include Emily Kame Kngwarreye. Early colonial artists showed a fascination with the unfamiliar land. The impressionistic works of Arthur Streeton, Tom Roberts, and other members of the 19th-century Heidelberg School—the first \"distinctively Australian\" movement in Western art—gave expression to nationalist sentiments in the lead-up to Federation. While the school remained influential into the 1900s, modernists such as Margaret Preston and Clarice Beckett, and, later, Sidney Nolan, explored new artistic trends. The landscape remained central to the work of Aboriginal watercolourist Albert Namatjira, as well as Fred Williams, Brett Whiteley, and other post-war artists whose works, eclectic in style yet uniquely Australian, moved between the figurative and the abstract.\n\n**Media**\n\nThe Story of the Kelly Gang (1906), the world's first feature-length narrative film, spurred a boom in Australian cinema during the silent film era. After World War I, Hollywood monopolized the industry, and by the 1960s, Australian film production had effectively ceased. With the benefit of government support, the Australian New Wave of the 1970s brought provocative and successful films, many exploring themes of national identity, such as Picnic at Hanging Rock, Wake in Fright, and Gallipoli, while Crocodile Dundee and the Ozploitation movement's Mad Max series became international blockbusters. In a film market flooded with foreign content, Australian films delivered a 7.7% share of the local box office in 2015. The AACTAs are Australia's premier film and television awards, and notable Academy Award winners from Australia include Geoffrey Rush, Nicole Kidman, Cate Blanchett, and Heath Ledger.\n\n**Cuisine**\n\nMost Indigenous Australian groups subsisted on a diet of native fauna and flora, otherwise called bush tucker. It has increased in popularity among non-Indigenous Australians since the 1970s, with examples such as lemon myrtle, the macadamia nut, and kangaroo meat now widely available.\n\n**Sport and recreation**\n\nThe most popular sports in Australia by adult participation are: swimming, athletics, cycling, soccer, golf, tennis, basketball, surfing, netball, and cricket.\n\nThis is the end of the article about Australia.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Australia\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe name Australia (pronounced /əˈstreɪliə/ in Australian English [41]) is derived from the Latin Terra Australis ('southern land'), a name used for a hypothetical continent in the Southern Hemisphere since ancient times [42] Several 16th-century cartographers used the word Australia on maps, but not to identify modern Australia [43] When Europeans began visiting and mapping Australia in the 17th century, the name Terra Australis was applied to the new territories [N 5]\n\n\nHistory\nIndigenous Australians comprise two broad groups:\n\n\nIndigenous prehistory\nIndigenous Australians comprise two broad groups:\n\n\nEuropean exploration and colonisation\nThe Dutch are the first Europeans that recorded sighting and making landfall on the Australian mainland [90] The first ship and crew to chart the Australian coast and meet with Aboriginal people was the Duyfken, captained by Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon [91] He sighted the coast of Cape York Peninsula in early 1606, and made landfall on 26 February 1606 at the Pennefather River near the modern town of Weipa on Cape York [92] Later that year, Spanish explorer Luís Vaz de Torres sailed through and navigated the Torres Strait Islands [93] The Dutch charted the whole of the western and northern coastlines and named the island continent \"New Holland\" during the 17th century, and although no attempt at settlement was made, [92] a number of shipwrecks left men either stranded or, as in the case of the Batavia in 1629, marooned for mutiny and murder, thus becoming the first Europeans to permanently inhabit the continent [94] In 1770, Captain James Cook sailed along and mapped the east coast, which he named \"New South Wales\" and claimed for Great Britain [95]\n\n\nColonial expansion\nIn 1803, a settlement was established in Van Diemen's Land (present-day Tasmania), [106] and in 1813, Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and William Wentworth crossed the Blue Mountains west of Sydney, opening the interior to European settlement [107] The British claim extended to the whole Australian continent in 1827 when Major Edmund Lockyer established a settlement on King George Sound (modern-day Albany) [108] The Swan River Colony (present-day Perth) was established in 1829, evolving into the largest Australian colony by area, Western Australia [109] In accordance with population growth, separate colonies were carved from New South Wales: Tasmania in 1825, South Australia in 1836, New Zealand in 1841, Victoria in 1851, and Queensland in 1859 [110] South Australia was founded as a free colony—it never accepted transported convicts [111] Growing opposition to the convict system culminated in its abolition in the eastern colonies by the 1850s Initially a free colony, Western Australia practised penal transportation from 1850 to 1868 [112]\n\n\nFederation to the World Wars\nOn 1 January 1901, federation of the colonies was achieved after a decade of planning, constitutional conventions and referendums, resulting in the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia as a nation under the new Australian Constitution [125]\n\n\nPost-war and contemporary eras\nIn the decades following World War II, Australia enjoyed significant increases in living standards, leisure time and suburban development [149] [150] Governments encouraged a large wave of immigration from across Europe, with such immigrants referred to as \"New Australians\" [151] This required a relaxation of the white Australia policy, which was justified to Australians using the slogan \"populate or perish\" [152]\n\n\nGeography\nSurrounded by the Indian and Pacific oceans, [N 7] Australia is separated from Asia by the Arafura and Timor seas, with the Coral Sea lying off the Queensland coast, and the Tasman Sea lying between Australia and New Zealand The world's smallest continent [170] and sixth-largest country by total area, [171] Australia—owing to its size and isolation—is often dubbed the \"island continent\" [172] and is sometimes considered the world's largest island [173] Australia has 34,218 km (21,262 mi) of coastline (excluding all offshore islands), [174] and claims an extensive exclusive economic zone of 8,148,250 square kilometres (3,146,060 sq mi) This exclusive economic zone does not include the Australian Antarctic Territory [175]\n\n\nGeneral characteristics\nSurrounded by the Indian and Pacific oceans, [N 7] Australia is separated from Asia by the Arafura and Timor seas, with the Coral Sea lying off the Queensland coast, and the Tasman Sea lying between Australia and New Zealand The world's smallest continent [170] and sixth-largest country by total area, [171] Australia—owing to its size and isolation—is often dubbed the \"island continent\" [172] and is sometimes considered the world's largest island [173] Australia has 34,218 km (21,262 mi) of coastline (excluding all offshore islands), [174] and claims an extensive exclusive economic zone of 8,148,250 square kilometres (3,146,060 sq mi) This exclusive economic zone does not include the Australian Antarctic Territory [175]\n\n\nGeology\nLying on the Indo-Australian Plate, the mainland of Australia is the lowest and most primordial landmass on Earth with a relatively stable geological history [204] [205] The landmass includes virtually all known rock types and from all geological time periods spanning more than 3.8 billion years of the Earth's history The Pilbara Craton is one of only two pristine Archaean 3.6–2.7 Ga (billion years ago) crusts identified on the Earth [206]\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate of Australia is significantly influenced by ocean currents, including the Indian Ocean Dipole and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, which is correlated with periodic drought, and the seasonal tropical low-pressure system that produces cyclones in northern Australia [216] [217] These factors cause rainfall to vary markedly from year to year Much of the northern part of the country has a tropical, predominantly summer-rainfall (monsoon) [178] The south-west corner of the country has a Mediterranean climate [218] The south-east ranges from oceanic (Tasmania and coastal Victoria) to humid subtropical (upper half of New South Wales), with the highlands featuring alpine and subpolar oceanic climates The interior is arid to semi-arid [178]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nAlthough most of Australia is semi-arid or desert, the continent includes a diverse range of habitats from alpine heaths to tropical rainforests Fungi typify that diversity—an estimated 250,000 species—of which only 5% have been described—occur in Australia [225] Because of the continent's great age, extremely variable weather patterns, and long-term geographic isolation, much of Australia's biota is unique About 85% of flowering plants, 84% of mammals, more than 45% of birds, and 89% of in-shore, temperate-zone fish are endemic [226] Australia has at least 755 species of reptile, more than any other country in the world [227] Besides Antarctica, Australia is the only continent that developed without feline species Feral cats may have been introduced in the 17th century by Dutch shipwrecks, and later in the 18th century by European settlers They are now considered a major factor in the decline and extinction of many vulnerable and endangered native species [228] Seafaring immigrants from Asia are believed to have brought the dingo to Australia sometime after the end of the last ice age—perhaps 4000 years ago—and Aboriginal people helped disperse them across the continent as pets, contributing to the demise of thylacines on the mainland [229] Australia is also one of 17 megadiverse countries [230]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nAustralia is a constitutional monarchy, a parliamentary democracy and a federation [248] The country has maintained its mostly unchanged constitution alongside a stable liberal democratic political system since Federation in 1901 It is one of the world's oldest federations, in which power is divided between the federal and state governments The Australian system of government combines elements derived from the political systems of the United Kingdom (a fused executive, constitutional monarchy and strong party discipline) and the United States (federalism, a written constitution and strong bicameralism with an elected upper house), resulting in a distinct hybrid [249] [250]\n\n\nStates and territories\nAustralia has six states—New South Wales (NSW), Victoria (Vic), Queensland (Qld), Western Australia (WA), South Australia (SA) and Tasmania (Tas)—and two mainland self-governing territories—the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and the Northern Territory (NT) [271]\n\n\nForeign relations\nAustralia is a middle power, [38] whose foreign relations has three core bi-partisan pillars: commitment to the US alliance, engagement with the Indo-Pacific and support for international institutions, rules and co-operation [285] [286] [287] Through the ANZUS pact and its status as a major non-NATO ally, Australia maintains a close relationship with the US, which encompasses strong defence, security and trade ties [288] [289] In the Indo-Pacific, the country seeks to increase its trade ties through the open flow of trade and capital, whilst managing the rise of Chinese power by supporting the existing rules based order [286] Regionally, the country is a member of the Pacific Islands Forum, the Pacific Community, the ASEAN+6 mechanism and the East Asia Summit Internationally, the country is a member of the United Nations (of which it was a founding member), the Commonwealth of Nations, the OECD and the G20 This reflects the country's generally strong commitment to multilateralism [290] [291]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe two main institutions involved in the management of Australia's armed forces are the Australian Defence Force (ADF) and the Department of Defence, together known as \"Defence\" [305] The Australian Defence Force is the military wing, headed by the chief of the defence force, and contains three branches: the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force In 2021, it had 84,865 currently serving personnel (including 60,286 regulars and 24,581 reservists) [306] The Department of Defence is the civilian wing and is headed by the secretary of defence These two leaders collective manage Defence as a diarchy, with shared and joint responsibilities [307] The titular role of commander-in-chief is held by the governor-general; however, actual command is vested in the chief of the Defence Force [308] The executive branch of the Commonwealth government has overall control of the military through the minister of defence, who is subject to the decisions of Cabinet and its National Security Committee [309] Major Australian intelligence agencies include the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (foreign intelligence), the Australian Signals Directorate (signals intelligence) and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (domestic security).\n\n\nHuman rights\nAustralia has generally strong protections for civil and political rights, and the country has signed up to a wide range of international rights treaties [312] Important documents protecting human rights include the Constitution, the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the Disability Discrimination Act 1992, and the Age Discrimination Act 2004 [313] Same-sex marriage has been legal in the nation since 2017 [314] [315] Unlike other comparable Western democracies, Australia does not have a single federal charter of rights in the Constitution or under legislation; however, the ACT, Victoria, and Queensland have state-based ones.\n\n\nEconomy\nAustralia's high-income mixed-market economy is rich in natural resources [318] It is the world's fourteenth-largest by nominal terms, and the 18th-largest by PPP As of 2021 [update], it has the second-highest amount of wealth per adult, after Luxembourg, [319] and has the thirteenth-highest financial assets per capita [320] Australia has a labour force of some 13.5 million, with an unemployment rate of 3.5% as of June 2022 [321] According to the Australian Council of Social Service, the poverty rate of Australia exceeds 13.6% of the population, encompassing 3.2 million It also estimated that there were 774,000 (17.7%) children under the age of 15 living in relative poverty [322] [323] The Australian dollar is the national currency, which is also used by three island states in the Pacific: Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu [324]\n\n\nEnergy\nIn 2021–22, Australia's generation of electricity was sourced from black coal (37.2%), brown coal (12%), natural gas (18.8%), hydro (6.5%), wind (11.1%), solar (13.3%), bio-energy (1.2%) and others (1.7%) [339] [340] Total consumption of energy in this period was sourced from coal (28.4%), oil (37.3%), gas (27.4%) and renewables (7%) [341] From 2012 to 2022, the energy sourced from renewables has increased 5.7%, whilst energy sourced from coal has decreased 2.6% The use of gas also increased by 1.5% and the use of oil stayed relatively stable with a reduction of only 0.2% [342]\n\n\nScience and technology\nIn 2019, Australia spent $35.6 billion on research and development, allocating about 1.79% of GDP [347] A recent study by Accenture for the Tech Council shows that the Australian tech sector combined contributes $167 billion a year to the economy and employs 861,000 people [348] In addition, recent startup ecosystems in Sydney and Melbourne are already valued at $34 billion combined [349] Australia ranked 23rd in the Global Innovation Index 2024 [350]\n\n\nDemographics\nAustralia has a population density of 3.4 persons per square kilometre of total land area, which makes it one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world The population is heavily concentrated on the east coast, and in particular in the south-eastern region between South East Queensland to the north-east and Adelaide to the south-west [31]\n\n\nCities\nAustralia contains five cities (including their suburbs) that consist of more than one million people Most of Australia's population live close to coastlines [360]\n\n\n\nAncestry and immigration\nBetween 1788 and the Second World War, the vast majority of settlers and immigrants came from the British Isles (principally England, Ireland and Scotland), although there was significant immigration from China and Germany during the 19th century Following Federation in 1901, a strengthening of the white Australia policy restricted further migration from these areas However, this policy was relaxed following WW2 and in the decades following, Australia received a large wave of immigration from across Europe, with many more immigrants arriving from Southern and Eastern Europe than in previous decades All overt racial discrimination ended in 1973, with multiculturalism becoming official policy [362] Subsequently, there has been a large and continuing wave of immigration from across the world, with Asia being the largest source of immigrants in the 21st century [363]\n\n\nLanguage\nAlthough English is not the official language of Australia in law, it is the de facto official and national language [374] [375] Australian English is a major variety of the language with a distinctive accent and lexicon, [376] and differs slightly from other varieties of English in grammar and spelling [377] General Australian serves as the standard dialect [378] The Australian sign language known as Auslan was used at home by 16,242 people at the time of the 2021 census [379]\n\n\nReligion\nAustralia has no state religion; section 116 of the Australian Constitution prohibits the Australian government from making any law to establish any religion, impose any religious observance, or prohibit the free exercise of any religion [385] However, the states still retain the power to pass religiously discriminatory laws [386]\n\n\nHealth\nAustralia's life expectancy of 83 years (81 years for males and 85 years for females) [390] is the fifth-highest in the world It has the highest rate of skin cancer in the world, [391] while cigarette smoking is the largest preventable cause of death and disease, responsible for 7.8% of the total mortality and disease Ranked second in preventable causes is hypertension at 7.6%, with obesity third at 7.5% [392] [393] Australia ranked 35th in the world in 2012 for its proportion of obese women [394] and near the top of developed nations for its proportion of obese adults; [395] 63% of its adult population is either overweight or obese [396]\n\n\nEducation\nSchool attendance, or registration for home schooling, [401] is compulsory throughout Australia Education is primarily the responsibility of the individual states and territories; however, the Commonwealth has significant influence through funding agreements [402] Since 2014, a national curriculum developed by the Commonwealth has been implemented by the states and territories [403] Attendance rules vary between states, but in general children are required to attend school from the age of about 5 until about 16 [404] [405] In some states (Western Australia, Northern Territory and New South Wales), children aged 16–17 are required to either attend school or participate in vocational training, such as an apprenticeship [406] [407] [408] [409] According to the 2022 PISA evaluations, Australian 15-year-olds ranked ninth in the OECD for reading and science and tenth for maths However, less than 60% of Australian students achieved the National Proficiency Standard – 51% in maths, 58% in science and 57% in reading [410] [411]\n\n\nCulture\nContemporary Australian culture reflects the country's Indigenous traditions, Anglo-Celtic heritage, and post-1945 history of multicultural immigration [427] [428] [429] The culture of the United States has also been influential [430] The evolution of Australian culture since British colonisation has given rise to distinctive cultural traits [431]

{"title": "Viktor_Medvedchuk", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nMedvedchuk's father, Volodymyr Medvedchuk, avoided being drafted into the Red Army during World War II due to his suffering from Pott disease During Nazi Germany's occupation of Ukraine, he worked for the German administration in a labor camp from April 1942 to November 1943 The section provided enforced deportation of the local able-bodied Ukrainian youth to work in Nazi Germany [26] Volodymyr Medvedchuk was arrested by SMERSH on 7 August 1954 and sentenced to eight years of imprisonment and four of exile in Siberia \"for participation in Ukrainian nationalistic activities.\" [26]\n\n\nLegal career and participation in political trials against Soviet dissidents\nIn 1979, Medvedchuk became a member of the Shevchenkivska Legal Consultation of the Kyiv City Collegiate of Attorneys [13] [29]\n\n\nFirst parliamentary tenure\nIn 1994, Medvedchuk became a member of the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (united) He served as chairman from 1998 until two days after the 26 March 2006 parliamentary election [13] [45] [46]\n\n\nHead of the Presidential Administration of Ukraine\nFrom June 2002 [38] until January 2005, [50] [51] Medvedchuk served as head of President Leonid Kuchma's presidential administration [45] [52] As such, he was a leading target for criticism by the opposition, including Viktor Yushchenko, who often spoke out bitterly against Medvedchuk Medvedchuk was considered the main behind-the-scenes man of then Prime Minister and pro-Kuchma presidential candidate Viktor Yanukovych in the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election, [13] which was nicknamed the \"battle of three Viktors\" after them and their main opponent Yushchenko.\n\n\nFailing to return to parliament\nIn the 2006

three decades. He has held various positions, including chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (united), head of the Presidential Administration of Ukraine, and leader of the Opposition Platform — For Life party.\n\n## Early Life and Education\n\nMedvedchuk was born in 1964 in Kyiv, Ukraine. His father, Volodymyr Medvedchuk, was a Ukrainian nationalist who avoided being drafted into the Red Army during World War II due to his suffering from Pott disease. During Nazi Germany's occupation of Ukraine, he worked for the German administration in a labor camp from April 1942 to November 1943. Volodymyr Medvedchuk was arrested by SMERSH on 7 August 1954 and sentenced to eight years of imprisonment and four of exile in Siberia \"for participation in Ukrainian nationalistic activities.\"\n\nMedvedchuk's early life was marked by his family's struggle with the Soviet authorities.
